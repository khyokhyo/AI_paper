            "review": "First, the service is horrible.  My friends and I had just arrived in Vegas and were tired from our early flight.  We found America at 10:30am and wanted to eat.  The hostess said that it was currently breakfast so we could not sit for lunch.  She told us to wait at the bar and she would come get us around 11.  She never did and we kept staring at her, but she wouldn't seat us.  Finally, we got up waited in line and she gave us a table!  I ordered the nachos and the veggie burger.  They were bland and not what we expected from a restaurant in Vegas.  The service was equally poor.  I asked for mayo and never got it because we had about 4 waiters."

            "review": "I ended up TWICE here in one night and didn't particularly like either experience, BUT was forced to come here because of one thing:  Every other restaurant in NY NY stops serving food late and I needed a snack (then my friends met me and needed some sustenance too) so my option was America orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr America.  So America it was.  The service late at night is awful, the bar drinks take FOR EV ER (and cost too much), the prices are crazy high for the quality of the food, and the overall vibe is kind of sucky too.  Everywhere else in NY NY has such a nice vibe (or at least A vibe), but America has a Denny's with a gargantuan map one.  It's a shame I spent so much money here.  In retrospect, I would've told my friends to suck it up and walk across the street to MGM to get something instead.  Now I know."

Had good service here when I was dining with friends, but when eating alone at the bar, the bar tender upgraded my order to something I didn't want and tried to charge me more for it. I turned away the extra food (containing gluten) and ate only what I ordered. (I know there is nothing about this place that says gluten free, but I'm willing to take a risk on bacon and eggs)."

As I was aimlessly walking around I remembered that there was a donut spot at NYNY I heard about and they had cronuts.\nStaff - one of them was clueless but luckily another came and rescued her. How hard of a question is, \"which donut do I need to try?\" You should have a favorite and if you don't you should have one that you can pretend is your favorite to answer questions just like that. I pretty much knew I was going to try a cronut but thought it was worth asking in case she was like \"OMG you have to try this one.\"\nCronut - this looked more like the original cronut than the one i had at PB Doughnuts. It was really good. I thoroughly enjoyed it but it still felt like it was missing something. I guess I'll never know until I try the original. Maybe this was a dead ringer but in that case I would wonder what the craze was all about.\nAnyway, didn't eat anything else here but awesome little selection of donuts and I'll probably be back when I decide to go back to NYNY sometime."

Unless of course you're \"dining\"  at New York, New York's very own bland-a-tron.  America, is a veritable cornucopia of bad food, cheesy decor and, get this, surprisingly good service.  Yeah, go figure. \n\nThere were 8 of us eating and the majority of us all had something to say about the pathetic dishes that were brought out.  My BLT looked like it was made with bread from the local 99 cent store.  My friend Ian, who also ordered the BLT and fries, received 7 french fries on his plate.  Yes, 7.  Needless to say, we complained and got the rest of the missing fries to join his sandwich.\n\nWhile the collective moans and groans at the table regarding the food were many, I found our waitress, Sigi, to be on top of her game.  It was almost as though she had a sixth sense regarding everything at the table.  Whether it was when we were placing the order or needing a refill, there she was, Joanna on the spot.\n\nBut , regardless of how good Sigi was, service only gets you so far.  So, when you're taking a break between between betting on black and rolling those dice, think twice about getting something to eat at America...it's a definite gamble.\n\nSee, what I did there?"

Shortly after we were seated, we saw that the NBA finals were on, but with no sound, and he big 'ol closed caption lines over the scoreboard.  So, we asked the waiter upon taking our orders to make them to go - we would be watching the game in our room.\n\nOur order - breakfast burrito and pancakes - took 25 goddam minutes. Even after the wait, being in generally good spirits, we were only mildly annoyed. All we had to do now was pay the bill and get out.\n\nHowever, that sentiment quickly turned, considering that after we received the food, our waiter didn't come back with the check. \n\n5 minutes pass... As I'm getting up to walk out with my free food, my wife grabs what appeared to be a manager, and asked him for our check. He brings the check, we provide our card, and he, too, decides not to come back. WTF?\n\nI ended up walking the check to the front so the manager could complete the transaction... then guess who decides to show up? The stupid goddam waiter! How've ya been, bud?\n\nHe approaches me as I'm walking back to our table and says, \"Is everything okay?\"\n\nNo, prick. I'm missing the finals.\n\nTo wrap it all up, the meal we had in our room was indicative on the \"wish it were mediocre\" service. Dry breakfast burrito, and pancakes that were crispy like waffles on the edges. \n\nSo yeah, this place sucks. If do come back, I'll be totally hammered so I can vomit on the tables after I eat."

This is a great place when you want food quickly and don't want to wait for a reservation at the many other dining options inside the casino.  America has the look and feel of a traditional diner. I love coming in here for breakfast.  They recently re-did their corn beef hash and eggs dish and it was very good.  Overall, for great value and good service you really can't go wrong here."

A lemon flavor in a dish should be light, this tasted like the pasta was cooked in concentrated lemon juice... terrible!

You're a 15.00+ cab ride away from your hotel down the strip and you have no cash, your friends are borderline vomits, you're wearing a $500 dress that's sopping wet from a naked hot tub party that seems like a distant memory (wait, naked? how was my dress wet?) and the only thing that's going to keep you alive is a cup of coffee and some buttered toast. Where do you go? You go to America, the only restaurant that will cater to your busted, drunk ass. \n\nWe ordered sausage, eggs and toast, a pot of coffee, chicken fingers and nachos. Someway or another, the grand total of the bill was $60, not  including tip. This is for crap I probably could have bought at 7-11 for $10.00 or less for the same quality. I guess when you're drunk and rambling, you have to pay extra for someone to try to decipher the shit coming out of your mouth. \n\nThe service here is terrible. It's because the people who work here hate their lives and it's evident in their lack of facial expression. Some may be suicidal, I mean, if I was working there at 4 am trying to talk to drunk people who have no idea what they're doing or saying, I'd probably think off-ing myself would be a good idea, too. \n\nThe only thing worth mentioning is that fucking gigantic map of the US. I've been to America a bunch of times, the most recent time being the basis of my review - but that shit is funny when you're sober, when you're drunk, when you're high, and I'm sure if I ever did shrooms or any sort of hallucinogen, I would want to come here and just stare at it. \n\nSo what I'm trying to say is, don't come here for the food - you come here when you've hit rock bottom with your partying and you need to chill the fuck out with some really greasy, crappy food. Expect to pay a fortune for food that some dog probably shit out a few hours earlier. That's all I really have to say."

Luckily, it is literally right next to the check in desk, so we didn't have to stray too far.\n\nWe were drawn in by their fabulous display of donuts and desserts. After seeing that a no frills cake donut was $2.50, I decided against just dessert. The place was pretty dead at 3pm. There's a huge 3D map of the US with different landmarks, which I thought was pretty cool to look at.\n\nI was definitely hungry so I ordered some spicy wings. The wings were a little too bready for me and they had a weird after taste. Not great.\n\nThe husband ordered the brownie sundae which was ginormous! 'Murica! The vanilla ice cream tasted like some generic drug store brand, which was off putting. You know how sometimes you don't eat ice cream out of the carton for a long time and there's that thick chewy bit at the top? That's what it tasted like. Besides that, the brownie tasted moist without being mushy. \n\nThe server at the bar was super nice and friendly. \n\nFYI...there aren't any restrooms inside the restaurant, so you'll have to take a short walk in the casino to do your business."

I ate here a few times during my stay and nothing wowed me. In fact, I sent back one of their \"freshly made\" donuts (that are sitting out all day and not behind a case or under glass to be kept fresh) because it was probably the worst doughnut I'd ever had--dry, flavorless and just YUCK.\n\nI ordered a fruit salad with cottage cheese for breakfast one day and it was really good--the fruit was fresh and everything tasted good. The next day I ordered the same thing and the fruit looked markedly different--wilted, definitely not as fresh and the cottage cheese tasted \"off\".\n\nI wouldn't waste my time ordering coffee here, so I got a latte made at Il Fornaio next door. Though they take a while and the line gets long, the coffee there looked much better than the coffee shop variety here. \n\nRather expensive for the quality, but they do serve you a hearty portion. \n\nI probably wouldn't have been back as many times as I was if I wasn't staying here and they serve breakfast foods all day, as opposed to Il Fornaio which stops serving breakfast at 10:30."

We came here because it was convenient so we would not brave the heatwave, over a 100 degrees and it was only 830am.  My friend sent his eggs back because they were cold.  I finished my simple breakfast of warm eggs and potatoes.  The first round of coffee was luke warm but the refill was hot.  My other friends steak was flavorless.  For 5 of us and a bill of $136.00 they should have refilled our water glasses.  Do yourselves a favor...stay away!

That being said, by the looks of their menu, there's an extensive line of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Prices look decent, especially since America is inside a casino.  We arrived around 7:30 AM and there wasn't much of a line.  So, I'm sure we'll be back one day for some real food. \n\nAs for my review...it's all about their donuts. I tried their maple bar with chocolate drizzle and some of their cronuts.  The maple bar wasn't as good as it looks.  The donut wasn't fresh, it was lacking any flavor, and for about $3, way to expensive.  However, I think America's has some of best cronuts that I've had in Las Vegas. I have my favorite out there, but America had a unique taste to their's.  Their cronuts were layered with the outside of each layer having a crunchiness to them.  It was moist inside each layer and as you get closer to the center of this hybrid donut, it's even softer.  There's a uniquie citrus taste to these cronuts which appeals to me.  America may have bad maple bars, but sure made a huge comeback with delicious cronuts. \n\nPS:  Additional photos of America's cronuts can be found here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donut-crawl-ii-las-vegas?select=IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2Wg#IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2Wg\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (057/366)"

            "review": ".strolling through the Casinos, \"America\" caught our eye and decided to have Sunday breakfast.  I wanted to order a healthy meal so I chose the \"eqq-white omelet with the vegetable fritatta\".  The omelet was fried in oil, but it wasn't greasy.  Serving size was medium (I estimate 3 eggs worth + 1 ounce of veggies).  My meal, to say the least was not memorable, and left me a bit hungry.  So I was glad that my meal came with a bowl of diced fruit.\n\nServers seemed so rushed, but apologetic for being harry. I really felt so rushed and that they just couldn't wait to turn the table. Put it this way, they practically started clearing the table before I was through with my fruit bowl.  So much so that, when I lifted my arm to take a serving of fruit from the bowl, that by time my fork hit the dish, they had wisked away the fruit bowl and my fork ended up scooping air from the table.\n\nAfter receiving the check, they immediately took the canteen of coffee away.  I guess that was our cue to leave.  On the way out, with our check in hand and headed to the register, we decided to admire the globe on the ceiling (which was the restaurant main feature and what drew us in). After gazing upwards for 20 seconds, the hostess snapped the check from our hand and said, \"i'll just ring you and if you can follow me, you can sign your bill\".   \n\nPrice for food/experience was not good.  My small meal + coffee + iced tea came to about 35 bux.  I would definitely NOT return and also NOT recommend to friends! There are better places to blow your money on."

Oh how I wish we lost it.\n\nWalking in, you get the feel of Denny's meets Marie Calendars, meets Carrows. \n\nI ordered the Eggs Benedict, BF ordered an omelet, safe right? \n\nOmelet arrived, looked like a normal omelet\nEggs Benedict - hmm, hollandaise sauce was topped over the egg, but why did it not drizzle even a little down the egg? And what's this black stuff on the muffin, wait, they burned the muffin?! Can't be too bad since only ONE side was burnt. OK, I have this rule of taking back food, I TRY NOT to. I took one bite and seriously, all I tasted was the burnt of the toast. OK, take 2, can I get this fixed? \n\nTake 2- Manager comes out to apologize for the order. OK, muffin not burnt, but only a the tips of the crust seem to be a little charred. Bite- why is this muffin not toasted? hollandaise sauce was thick and gewey, tasted a bit mushy. Egg was a bit overcooked and hash browns were mushy on the outside. No amount of Ketchup could save them. Only hate 1/2 of one muffin.\n\nBF said his omelet was OK, but I guess his stomach didn't give the same reaction and suffered for 2 days after.\n\nService was sub par. At least my meal was  comped."

Was incredibly delicious and the price was just right around $14. My girlfriend had the Spaghetti and Meatballs. She loved it so much we actually came back a second time to dine here. I couldn't believe how attentive the waiters were during dinner. They must have came by like 5 times to check on us. Bonus points for the waiters. \n\nI believe we dined here 4 times during the course of our stay at New York New York. Twice for breakfast, once for lunch and dinner. The second time around I wasn't too impressed with the Philly Cheesesteak special. The bread felt very soggy and that ruined the taste.\n\nFor Breakfast, I had the New York State of Mind which is your traditional bacon, eggs, white toast with a side of fries. Their bacon strips are huge and I absolutely loved it. However they charged $5 for Orange Juice which I was not very pleased to see when the bill arrived. Very very overpriced for Orange Juice. Shame on you, 1 star off for trying to gouge the customer.\n\nModerately priced for all the other items on the menu and I would recommend giving this place a shot if you are looking for something traditional that you would find at most American diners like Dennys or IHOP."

My friend and I split 2 meals, 4 cheese pizza and rueben wrap. The pizza was HORRIBLE! The worst pizza I've ever had, including frozen microwaveable pizzas and that's exactly what it was like. I could tell just by the look of it that it was not going to be good but then I took a bite. Cold, chewy spongy soft dough, the only thing fresh on the pizza was the parsley. I'm not exaggerating it was the worst meal, I'd rather have a happy meal at McDonalds! The Rueben wrap wasn't much better, rubbery fatty meat, smothered in sauce. It was bad but not as bad as the pizza. Save yourself the money and and frustration and don't eat here!"

Not too snooty but not at all divey.  My steak was cooked perfectly and the rest of the food was amazing for a 3:00 am meal. The decor is wonderful and keeps the eyes entertained during the entire visit. The doughnut bar is wonderful and has excellent selections. They stay open 24 hours but the food taste much better than any 24 hour place I've been. Not to mention that in Vegas 24 hour spots are required knowledge. I've been twice and in both experiences the waitresses were excellent and patient.  Bonus:This cafe serves alcohol!\n\nTHE BAD: American food can be found a little cheaper elsewhere.  It's in a Hotel Casino and that may not suit all families. This also means you can't park out front so you'll have to walk from the hotel parking structure waaaay out back. They allow smoking indoors in Las Vegas. (I guess for some that could be good or bad).\n\nALL IN ALL:  I rated this place with 5 stars because to me it is the ultimate cafe in Vegas. It is above cafe scale in its entirety including the 24 hour service, on strip location, great hotel, great service, and great tasting food. I consider it a MUST for the Vegas traveler."

I noticed many of the unhappy Yelpers  complained about the breakfast service and food, so that may be why our experience was much better since we went during dinner on a weekday night.  Our server was Tha and he was very professional and made sure we were taken care of.  They had a kids menu complete with crayons which made our son very happy.  He brought out juice in a kids cup also which was a plus since we were inside a casino and have not found many places that catered to children during this trip.  The large 2-D map on the ceiling captured his interest for a long while too.  We ordered the kids cheeseburger and fries for our son, which came on a wheat bun and served with potato wedges.  The bf ordered a patty melt and fries.  I had the catch of the day, very fresh grilled salmon in a chili glaze with seasoned rice and fresh sauteed vegetables.  I was hungry and the portion was a bit small, so a cup of soup or salad included probably would have satisfied me.  The cousins ordered nachos and the steak and crab leg special which they did enjoy.  We were able to catch up with each other for over 2 hours without feeling rushed.  This is one of the few places we will return to when wanting to eat at a restaurant inside any casino.  The food is decently priced, fresh, and tastes decent.  When we used our comp to pay for our bill, Tha never bristled like a few of the servers at the other places did.  Since he provided excellent service, he received a large tip.  That is what servers need to realize, even though the meal is comped, if you provide good service, most people will still tip you, and leave much more than usual since they did not have to pay for the meal.  I used to be a server so I know this for a fact!  It is all about the attitude and service next to the food."

There are times you hope the menu has so much stuff it overwhelms, then we complain. Then when it doesn't you have that feeling to still complain and wonder, \"thats it?\" There are plenty of selections, from salads, to soups, sandwhiches, entrees, etc. **YELP TIP** CHECK OUT THEIR WEBSITE FOR THE MENUS\n\nThere is a nice simple bar within the restaurant entrance if you want to get your drank on without being in a crowded place. It's INSIDE the NY NY, so you do have to go through the casino, but it is simple to find. \n\nWould I eat here again? Sure! However, would I actually go here again? Only if I had to.\n\nBTW, Great staff. Very friendly and not robotic in personality.\n\nOPEN 24HRS"

On our second visit, we got the Breakfast Burrito (farm fresh eggs, black forest ham, bacon with chorizo sausage and pepper jack cheese, wrapped in a warm flour tortilla) and the King Club (roasted turkey breast, applewood smoked bacon, romaine lettuce and tomatoes on toasted sourdough).

The food no joke took almost an hour to come out and mine must of been finished first because the fries were ice cold and sandwich was soggy all the way through the bread.

Someone ordered a quesadilla, which they get from America, and it was pretty darn good.  So we went for a little snack.  I just had a chicken salad, and it wasn't bad at all for a quick bite.  I can't remember what the husband ordered, but be enjoyed his food as well.  Then we had the cheesecake.  I'm not a dessert person, but it was delicious!    It's open 24 hours so we returned later for a club sandwich.  America will not blow your socks off, but it's dependable & the service is good."

I wish I would have read recent YELP! reviews prior to going.  \n\nHad this been a review for last year, it would have been 5 stars.  We went here last year for St. Patty's Day - they have a great menu of roasted potato soup, corn beef/cabbage/carrot/potato and creme brulee for dessert.  LAST YEAR we were served Guinness with green sugar rimmed glasses and the bartender gave us green beer (although they supposedly weren't allowed due to a mess on the bar the previous year).  Our waiter was GREAT!\n\nJump ahead exactly 12 months.  We returned for a repeat of the great time we had in 2010, however, we were met with HORRIBLE service and a bartender who REFUSED to add sugar to our Guinness!!  REFUSED!  I have NEVER been refused something so simple, plus they set precedence for it the previous year.  MARY was the bartender and BONNIE was our server - UGH!  NEVER AGAIN!  I even showed Bonnie a photo of my beer on my phone with the \"America\" napkin under it.  She really didn't care.  She also only checked on us once the entire 2 hours we were there, and we had to hunt down people to get us refills on drinks, and pay our bill.  The table next to ours agreed with the bad service when they had to yell for someone to take their bill, too.\n\nThe food was okay, the presentation of the corned beef/cabbage was much nicer last year.  And the dessert was blah.\n\nWe will be finding ourselves a new place to enjoy St. Patty's day and spend our money next year.  NYNY can kiss my Irish bootie!"

Our waiter was extremely professional and very warm and friendly. He promptly brought our drinks and then took our order. The service was excellent and prompt. The food was brought out and we weren't disappointed. The portions are good sized. The food is American cuisine so nothing special on the menu, but the food is good. The service was above average and because of this, we will probably come back. From experience, we will most likely visit again when it is not so busy so that we can enjoy the great service. Three stars for the food. Four stars for the service. This place is a solid 3.5 stars."

            "review": "We stayed at the New York-New York this last weekend for 2 nights.   Both nights we ended up seeking refuge at the America Diner at some ungodly hour, much like old travelers of yore would seek refuge at a Tavern to escape the icy snowstorm howling outside.   Except in our case it wasn't howling but it was the incessant sound of clinging coins, and it wasn't a snowstorm but utter mayhem on the Casino floor.   Lastly, it wasn't icy but it was an inconceivable amount of cheap booze that would leave us clutching ourselves in agony the next morning.  While the food pretty much sucked at America, I'm still pretty fucking glad the place was still open at 3 AM on Sunday morning.\n\nWhile my wife ordered the steak the first night, she opted for the pancakes the second night.   I went with the Macaroni & Cheese and a Spicy Chicken Sandwich the first night and the Macaroni & Cheese and Potato Skins the second night.    (Hey! Nothing like simple carbs to absorb an insane amount of alcohol lounging about in your stomach)\n\nThe first night, the Mac & Cheese tasted very much like I what I imagine a Salt Lick tastes like.   The Spicy Chicken Sandwich was anything but.  I'm guessing they ran out of Buffalo sauce and they figured I was too drunk to give a fuck.   While it's true I was too drunk to start an argument then & there, I knew I'd get these fuckers on Yelp sooner or later.    The Mac & Cheese the 2nd night was legit... not great but certainly better than the first night since I could actually glimpse the taste of cheese that time around.   My wife said the steak was completely fucked up and she's still having painful bowel movements some 48 hours later.   The pancakes were good, but then again how does one really fuck up pancakes now, right?\n\nIf this was the Bay Area, I'd probably give this place 1 star or 2 at the very most.   Seeing as they're open 24 hours a day though, I'm being generous and giving them 3 stars.   Besides, as drunk as we were, it's fascinating to realize that you're the most composed couple at 3 AM in here.   I feel bad for the waiters and waitresses here... They gotta deal with some seriously fucked up shit every day."

My husband is vegetarian so he ordered two eggs scrambled with hash browns, jalape\u00f1os, and pepper jack cheese. He asked for it to be extra crispy but it ended up being still soft. Regardless it was still pretty good. The eggs however were not. It did not taste like real eggs to us. He also got a tall glass of chocolate milk which made it up to my Hubby. They do let you order donuts to your table but I did not see a menu for that at the seats. We were too full to get one but there is always next time. \nThe ambience is great for large groups, families (the kids will love the huge 3D artwork of America), and for couples as well. There is also a bar seating with TVs if you'd like to watch news or sports."

Maybe the waitress was actually cooking also. Who knows?   For an appetizer we had the ahi tuna and watermelon, and I had fish and chips for my dinner.  Very basic dishes.

The only reason we came here was because we all drove 5 hours and were dying of starvation... literally!\n\nFirst off, the service was horrible. The place was vacant and probably had 15-20 customers max, so I thought we were going to be tended to promptly. Nope we were wrong. We had to hail the waitress from across the room after we waited 10 minutes of getting seated. Did I mention we were dying of starvation?\n\nThe food finally came and it kept going down hill from there. Here's a few of the dishes we tried:\n\n-Steak & Crab Legs: The Steak was so tough and gritty, it took my cousin almost 20 minutes to finish her steak. The Crab was still frozen. There were icicles still inside, inedible. \n\n-BBQ Ribs: Not bad, but not that great either. This was probably one of the mediocre dishes we had\n\n-Salads: We ended up getting a few of the salads (Asian Salad?). They were all horrible and had no taste what so ever. \n\n-Turkey Sandwich: How can you go wrong with a sandwich, it wasn't bad.\n\nOver all, this place deserves a 2 star rating entirely. We won't be back here again. I did like the fact that the manager did comp us some donuts , which were horrible also. BLAH!"

Bacon Maple bars, cinnamon roll donut, bear claw & glazed donuts. \n\nThey were OK because they were cold and probably sitting out for awhile. I'm sure when they first come out they are delicious. I would suggest checking how fresh they are before purchasing."

Loved the quesadillas! But hated the tuna sandwich, and I was drunk when I ate it. So it has to be pretty bad. But really you can't go wrong, there is something for everyone on the menu. Also they have a special going on where it's $3 well drinks during happy hour and between the hours of 12am-5am M-F. \n\nI never physically ate in the restaurant since we ordered our food at the bar and took it up to our room so I really can't comment on the service or the hostess. But the bar staff were all really cool, once we were even reminded of the $3 special so we just had to order a drink."

The onion marmalade was very good, the patty was soft even when it is well done (it is ground prime rib). The patty is half pound. The burger came with baked potato. The size is big that I can't finish the whole burger, while my husband finished his whole plate including the baked potato. The only down side is that I wish they would put more horseradish aioli on it. \nThe service was good. The waiter was sincere and polite.\n\nAnother up side is that it opens 24 hours so it is very convenient while the price isn't crazy. The decoration was very interesting too as there is a half wall made into an american map, and there is different things pinned on each state. For example, there is an alligator figure on the Florida state, and there is an astronaut figure on Texas.\nThey have a 4-7pm rib eye special. We probably will try it next time."

My dad wanted to stay at New York New York. I ate at about 5 restaurants there. I've been checking the reviews of America and other hotel restaurants and they were pretty critical. I went here twice. The first time was a Friday noon and I got the Margarita Pizza. Even though it was Vegas, it wasn't to sure about how good it was. It was actually deep dish style instead of the brick oven style. My step-mom's friend, Ann is from New Jersey and to her it was all about the crust. She liked it. To me, it was all about the toppings like the tomato sauce or the cheese. The pizza was excellent and when my dad tried it, he was in pizza heaven. The second time I tried it was was the morning we left on Sunday. I had French Toast with cinnamon and sugar. That was good also. The bread was soft, it melted in your mouth and the cinnamon and sugar made it sweet which made all those flavors work perfectly together."

It could serve 2-3 people and came with French's Mustard and Cheddar Cheese Sauce. It was what you would expect any soft pretzel to be: soft and chewy and delicious.  \n\nPetite Caesar Salad - While it maybe \"petite\" it really was a generous serving. The house made croutons were huge (and my toddler loved chewing on them), and it was pretty tasty.\n\nABC Omelet and the Ham & Cheese Omelet - Pretty good. Generous amount of avocado on the ABC omelet, and lots of ham in the Ham & Cheese omelet. I thought it was interesting that the cheese wasn't inside the omelet, but rather melted on top. Both came with hash browns and choice of toast, and a delicious mini muffin.\n\nSteak and Eggs - Steak was a bit under cooked, but the rest was good. \n\nCorned Beef Hash & Eggs - A little greasy and kind of a small portion,but good nonetheless. \n\nAmerica is careful to prevent cross contamination if you have a gluten intolerance, which we really appreciated. They have several options that are GF and took the time to make sure everything came out as it should.

I ordered the bagel sandwich, which has eggs, bacon, ham, and cheddar cheese.  It comes with hash browns.  The only hot sauce America has is red Tabasco, which I don't care for by itself.  So, the waiter asked if I would like to try their salsa.  I said I would.  The salsa wasn't bad, it actually had a little spice.  It's thin, so it was hard to get on the sandwich, I basically had to dip.  I was annoyed when the bill arrived and I had a $1.50 charge for the salsa.  It's not that I care about paying $1.50, but he offered like he was doing me a favor and didn't mention it was an additional charge.  I would have still said yes, but I feel like you should give diners a heads up when there is a charge that's not on the menu directly in front of them.\n\nThe sandwich was large and did not stay together well.  The bagel was grilled, but not toasted.  I would have preferred it toasted for a more consistent result.  The shaved ham overwhelmed the sandwich, which is too bad because the bites I did get with bacon were very good.  The hash browns had a decent sear to them, they clearly were cooked well.  \n\nIt's not fantastic, but a decent value if you are in need of a quick and casual meal.  Also, the map of the USA around the restaurant is pretty cool."

(This review is really late because I forgot to finish it because I started it on my phone!)\n\nActually three times if you count me ordering room service my first day and this being it..\n\nThe first time was excellent!  Service was fantastic, hostess was very sweet and talked to me as I came in.  She actually seemed interested in talking and listening when I told her about my stay so far.  Coffee was delicious, good food (although I didn't love the fried eggs).  The restaurant is huge inside so there was no waiting .  Loved it!\n\nI came the next morning and got a completely different experience.  It was actually BAD.  Waiter didn't seem concerned about getting me anything in a timely fashion.  Again, the restaurant wasn't too busy, so there was no excuse.  \nMy food was so bad and the eggs were so runny, that I had to send them back.  And I never send food back because I feel bad....\nAnyhow, I sent it back (after waiting forever to get the waiter's attention and instead I got the manager's attention).\nMy food came back a second time partially cooked more, but still runny.  I hate the runny white part in eggs over medium.  It was pretty gross.  I couldn't eat it and was starving by then, so I just ate the toast and bacon.\nMy toast was ice cold.  The butter wouldn't even melt on it.\nI was told there wasn't any creamer for the coffee, and instead they brought me a cup with milk in it.  I ended up not drinking my coffee at all.\n\nI was ready to rip this place apart....\n\nThen I asked the waiter for the bill since he didn't seem to get the hint that I had been sitting there forever waiting for it.  And he told me the manager covered it and not to worry about it.\n\nFortunately for me, I didn't have any cash and couldn't even leave him a tip.  Not that he deserved a dime.\n\nSo because the manager at least had the common courtesy to cover my breakfast, I didn't give them the 1 star I had planned....\nI'm not sure if I'd come here again.....I might try it once more...."

The food court is closed and the only place open within close proximity is this place. I instantly fear the abhorrent midnight mediocrity that is the standard for most late night casino eats however this place is a welcome surprise for late night eats. \n\nI ordered the 15.99 rib eye steak late night special; medium rare with a loads baked potato and the lady ordered the monte cristo sandwich. \n\nFood quality was very good. \nThe steak was a generous ribeye cut and it was actually cooked as requested. (I say that because you can't ask for the world when ordering late night steak specials) Needless to say, its probably the best steak I've had at 4am . \n\nThe lady's Monte Cristo was as awesome!\nThe French Toast was well cooked (meaning not runny eggs/sloppy or burnt ). It was the a great marriage between breakfast and lunch in your mouth at 4 am. \n\nAs expected the service and food came out slow. (This is expected when you are dining at 4am) however the server was very friendly and accommodating so it really was not an issue at all. \n\n\nI don't know if we lucked out but I can seem to understand how this place has so many bad reviews? This place is much better than most late night casino eats. \n\nI say eat with confidence; especially at  4am"

She does not seem to care about customers and won't even look at you while speaking. Other than her, the other staff were very nice. However I would not come back for the food, it's very easily compared to IHOP. I had chocolate milk, which I hated because it was pre-made. I prefer milk and chocolate stirred. I also ordered the chicken and waffles- like I said, comparable to IHOP. My dad got the steak and eggs and he liked it and it looked good so that is probably the not suggestable item. Might as well walk a bit and make the trip to pay a bit less. Overall experience was meh."

During my recent trip to Vegas, I was appalled to find that the only 24 hr dining options at Excalibur (where I was staying) and Luxor were McDonald's and Krispy Kreme. My wife and I were in search of late late night/early morning dining that was more substantial that doughnuts or a gut-bomb burger. We were perplexed and nearly gave up when we literally stumbled upon America. The food was average... nothing special. Large breakfast menu, some hot sandwiches and burger, and a small dinner menu (maybe they had more, but I may not have been given the \"dinner\" menu). Our waiter was awesome. He struck me as a little.... slow, but he was an amazing human being and a fantastic waiter! Our food took a little longer than I would expect for 0400, but beggars can't be choosers. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and my wife ordered The Empire State Plate (two eggs, sausage or bacon, hash browns, and toast). Sarah LOVED her meal... she thought the hash browns were amazing and so were the eggs. My burger was rather unremarkable, but I don't consider that a bad thing. The restaurant is great for that late night meal that you crave after hours of sitting at the casino tables and our waiter was amazing and got a big tip. Three stars for being open late night, but couldn't quite bring myself to give 4 because the food took a while to come out and I would compare it to Denny's quality."

I was easily drawn to the sign that had the post midnight special: a 16 oz. steak meal for only $11.99.  I'll take that please!\n\nWe came in and ordered fairly quickly as there were only a few people sitting in this enormous room filled with memorabilia from around the\nUnited States. I ordered the steak special which came with two sides. I ended up getting some coleslaw to substitute the vegetables and an order of the french fries.\n\nThe food came out in about 12 minutes or so, which is a good time to wait. The steak was decent. It was a litte tough to tell the truth, even though I had ordered it medium rare. Id say the steak was decent \nespecially for the price so theres nothing to complain about.  The \ncoleslaw was forgettable as were the fries. \n\nIf you're really hungry and in the area I'd say go for it, otherwise there's probably other better alternatives."

We walked into the restaurant and the host was very gracious and genuine inquiring how our trip was. She was so grandmotherly!  I ordered the ABC OMELET which consisted of Fresh Avocado, Bacon and Wisconsin Cheddar and I ordered a side of bacon. When my entree arrived I was surprised to discover that the avocado was simply sliced up and garnished on top my omelette. My side bacon was not that great though. I specifically asked the waitress if the bacon was good there and she assured me that she would make sure it was cooked properly and it would crunchy. My bacon came out somewhat burnt and chewy. Overall, my omelette was satisfying and the grandmotherly hostess was the highlight."

I don't like my pancakes swimming in syrup and they were not and I still needed more syrup to make them wet looking. My sausage links I did like the flavor and they were good.

They get away with it because they are located in the N.Y. N.Y. Hotel and can charge high prices for low end food.  My friend and I had dinner there recently, I had the flat iron steak and my friend had the shrimp scampi dinner. It wasn't that impressive looking at it in the dish but we thought it tasted OK not great but OK.  Service was terrible, our waitress took the order and then never checked back to see if the food was to our liking. We had to call the manager for a minor problem. We saw the waitress when it was check time.  I tasted his food and he had some of mine and we agreed it wasn't worth the price.  When we left the restaurant we both got such tummy aches we had to literally RUN TO THE NEAREST RESTROOM, and everything we just ate immediately left our body. (need I say more). Apparently the food wasn't handled properly.  After we came back from the restroom we both felt fine.  I called the restaurant and complained and also filled out a report (why) I didn't say I had food poisoning, but this was their  practice, to cover themselves just in case.  I emailed the corporate office about our experience and received a phone call from their VP whose name was Paul and he told me \"it was baloney\" I couldn't possibly have gotten sick that quickly from their food.  His manners on the phone were horrible, very loud and didn't listen to what I was telling him.  Basically he said I couldn't have gotten sick from their food and I told him unless he ate the food out of my dish he shouldn't say that.  He wasn't there watching it being prepared nor did he eat it.  Since  we both had stomach aches and rushed to the restroom after leaving the America Restaurant  it was because of the improper handling of the food.  I expected an apology but what I got was a yapping Vice President who of course believes that the America restaurant is perfect.  Nothing is perfect and if a customer complains about a problem I would think good customer service would be to apologize for a terrible dining experience.  Not so here.  So BEWARE IF YOU DINE AT THIS RESTAURANT,  YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO VISIT THE RESTROOM TOO."

So we were pointed in the direction of America.\n  The food quality was about the same as you'd get at IHOP or Denny's, and the prices about the same. So nothing to rave or complain about. My Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs was tasty, fatty, and delicious. Our waters were constantly refilled, and the decor and environment felt relaxing enough. What really stood out was...as I am asian..I MUST have soy sauce with my over easy eggs..Get that Ketchup and Salsa away from me. Our server said it'd be no problem, and she actually went all the way to neighboring restaurant Chin Chin to get me a bowl of soy sauce. Wow above and beyond the call of duty.\n  The only real reason I gave this four rather than five stars, was that our server disappeared for what seemed like ten minutes before we could pay our bill. Not a deal breaker, but a nuisance nonetheless.  Anyway if you're in NYNY and want some breakfast, it's worth a shot. Not to mention if you don't care about having eggs and hashbrowns etc. They have a great deal for all you can eat pancakes at like $6 (which were fluffy and delicious). One of my buds ordered that and helped feed the entire table (our server didn't mind at all)..which was cool.\n~G"

We were seated fairly quickly after a 10-minute wait. This place is huge and it was fairly empty at this time. The map of the US hanging from the ceiling is a nice touch and very educational.\n\nAlmost everyone in our group got the $12 rib-eye steak midnight special. My steak was delicious! and cooked to my liking. Although I had asked for my steak to be cooked medium, my gf noted that it wasn't medium and that it was missing the little plastic thing they stick on the meat to show how well it was cooked.\n\nMedium or not, I still enjoyed it. Must be my hunger taking over. I've also never heard of HP brand steak sauce until I came here. I usually pour A1 on my steak but after trying the HP sauce, I'm a convert! It had more zing and brought out the taste of the steak to the fullest.\n\nWe had a lava cake for dessert but I didn't like the ice cream that came with it. Toffee/coffee flavored. I prefer chocolate or vanilla next to my lava cake.\n\nMy only complaint was that I had ordered my steak with mash potatoes but instead it came with baked potato. I liked the baked potato enough so I didn't bother to have it exchanged. Also, I had to flag down the waiter a few times to remind him to bring/refill my gf's iced tea. He keeps on forgetting. I guess I can't blame him for serving a huge group on a graveyard shift.\n\nOther than that, I believe America is an ok place. It's not a fine dining establishment but I am somewhat surprised with all the one-two star ratings.\n\nI must be missing something."

The steaks were tasty but just a bit over cooked (we asked for medium rare and got medium, which was fine). 4/5 stars. \n\nThe morning after we got coffee and donuts. 5/5... Cinnamon sugar cronut was heavenly. Boston cream donut, delicious. \n\nService was slower that I would have liked, but not terrible. 4/5 stars.\n\nGigantic America on the ceiling was fun to look at.  We spent awhile discussing what it was made of. Styrofoam? Concrete? Paper mache?\n\nOverall pretty good. I would go back after a night of heavy drinking for breakfast steak and eggs!"

Its loacted inside of new york new york from the outside you'd think it would be really good, a great place to have a hearty \"american\" meal you can but it is going to cost you 20 dollars for that meal. There a few items on the menu less than 10 dollars that don't provide a lot of food, what they do have though is all you can eat pancakes for 6.95. Now I can eat me some cakes so I decided to get this. You get your first plate of two nice bigs pancakes which are really thick, but beyond dry. Added a side of bacon which was 4 dollars for 3 strips and a coffee which was 3. The wait staff was rude and not very attentive at all. So stay away!"

Thank goodness for the not-so-friendly waitress walking around.\n\nQuesadilla - A little oily but not too bad.  It would have been better probably if we ate it at the restaurant so I'm not complaining too much.  The salsa was decent and the filling was significant.  Definitely an American style quesadilla.   Would try it again.\n\nBurger/Fries - Cooked MR and dressed appropriately.  It was a decent burger with no frills at all.  Definitely a $6 burger per Carl's Jr.   The fries were okay but I can't expect too much from pool side service fries.  \n\nNot bad but not great.   If service lady was a little nicer, it would have been a lot tastier I presume.  Who knows.  Anyway, I lived a little dangerously and went swimming 29 minutes after I ate."

Not to forget the option of adding protein to your smoothies.\n\nThis place isn't bad after coming back to the hotel at 3 in the morning and craving some cheap ribeye. \n\nThe steak benedict was like a cute steak sandwich covered with strong hollandaise sauce. If you like salty, its definitely the right thing for you. But I really wanted to wipe off all the hollandaise sauce so I can just have a steak slider. \n\nThe bacon on the other hand was some of the best I've ever had. It's better to just go simple here if you're craving a quick breakfast. Save your money for the rest of the casino."

My mom and I decided to eat here because we were staying at New York New York and we didn't want to walk the strip for breakfast and this was within the Hotel. We chose it because it was a traditional American breakfast and we were craving pancakes and french toast. Upon walking up the hostess was very rude. I asked if we could sit on the edge and not in the middle of the room, because we wanted a quieter spot than being smack in the middle of everyone. The hostess was rude and told us only one table was open and it was one in the middle. We sat and a few minutes later, low and behold, they started seating people on the edge, after I was told we couldn't have a table in those areas. Next, I ordered the croissant french toast. It was awful. Cold, hard, I couldn't even cut it with a fork. The french toast also had no flavor, very bland. My mom had the regular french toast, and her food was also pretty bad. Cold, no flavor and looked like her bread was smashed. It was so dreadful I called over a manager. The manager was a very nice lady. She apologized and comped our meal. The manager offered me to choose something different on the menu, but I honestly was so turned off by the whole experience I didn't even want to try anything else they had on their menu. The manager was nice and so was our waiter, other than that there is nothing good I can say about this place. Honestly, as a person who loves breakfast this is an honest review. I do not want people to waste their money here. There are so many yummy places to eat in Vegas, and the whole point of Vegas is to splurge and have fun. Skip this place and find something you will enjoy. :)"

It offers an extensive variety of diner/bar food that includes appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pastas, limited entr\u00e9es, and a few breakfast items.  It has a big dining room with a large bar and the d\u00e9cor is unremarkable except for the huge map of the USA on its ceiling.\n \nMy wife and I stopped there around midnight after a late show for a light bite.  The place had few patrons and we sat at the bar.  Our female bartender was amicable and poured each of us a good drink.  My wife and I shared a triple-decker club sandwich and a side of French fries.  The sandwich was tasty and the fries were hot and flavorful.  The food and drinks hit the spot and nicely satisfied our late hour cravings. \n\nThe America Caf\u00e9 is recommended for providing a convenient, simple meal at a late hour."

Did a search on the restaurants in NYNY and found that America was the only non bar open at that time (1 am).  Menu looked decent, certainly appeared to be better than McDonalds.  Hostess was nice, we were seated right away.  Waiter comes and takes our order, and then we wait.  And wait.  And wait.  45 minutes passes, no food, and I haven't seen our waiter in at least 25 min.  I flag down the hostess, who says she will find out what is going on.  About 3 min later I see our waiter saunter in from out of the restaurant.  He goes to the back, and surprise surprise, our food is ready!\n\nI had ordered a burger, my wife the night's special, a sirloin steak, medium well.  The steak was burned to a crisp, definitely medium well.  My burger, while it did not appear burnt, tasted burnt.  The bun was soggy as well.  Not what we expected after waiting 45 min.  We contacted the manager who was very apologetic, and offered to get us some cold sandwiches from the menu.  We declined and he did not ask us to pay for the meals.  He said that he would be talking to the cook about it.\n\nWe will not be going into this restaurant on our next Vegas trip.

It was far from crowded.  We asked our server for more water and a few lemons, and he forgot both, even after we reminded him.  We had to help ourselves from the lemons at the bar- LAME.  Then he made some comment like, \"I could have brought those to your table, you know,\" full of attitude.  \n\nWhen we finally got our bills (he also had major 'tude with giving us individual tabs), he had given us all of our change in quarters.  Some of us had more change than necessary and some of us were short-changed.  NONE of us had the correct change.  At this point I lost it and proceeded to go pretty much ape sh*t on our 45 year old server with a comb-over.  \"Excuse me, look- all of our change is completely um, how do i say this, NOT RIGHT. AT ALL.\"  He gives me a blank stare and then shrugs it off: \"Sorry, we don't have any other coins except quarters here.  We give change in quarters.\" Then he smiles sweetly and says, \"Would you like to speak to the manager, miss?\"  the rest is pretty ugly from there.\n\nNow, let me clear that i am not expecting the world's greatest meal OR service from America the restaurant inside a Vegas casino.  However, I do expect to get what i pay for and that includes getting the correct change back, NOT IN JUST QUARTERS. \n\nAs far as this restaurant goes, it's America the Shitty, and I would rather just roll to any other hotel's 24/7 cafe to eat.  They all have one.\n\nThe club sandwich was good though...Meh."

Featuring a menu of expectedly American classics ranging from pancakes and waffles to country fried steaks and eggs it was with a bit of disdain that I arrived to find the Monte Cristo now relegated to the 'lunch' menu but happy to accommodate given the restaurant's 24-hour nature it was with a simple request that the sandwich was prepared and arriving on a covered plate alongside the Frosted Flake French Toast both dishes would prove competent , though nothing to write home about, with prices and portions both in line with other Las Vegas Boulevard breakfast joints thus leaving plenty of stomach space for a sampling of the restaurant's deep fried dough.  Featuring no less than a dozen different varieties with three cronuts plus fritters, crullers, filled, raised, cake, and fancy on display it was with a bit of indecision that I pondered my options and eventually settling on a few personal favorites plus those most interesting a quintet was selected at a total of $12.50 and aside from the lackluster, artificial banana flavor of \"Monkey See, Monkey Do-nut\" the results were very impressive indeed; the 'cronut' as close to Dominique Ansel's original in texture as I've found (a plus for those seeking authenticity, though I still prefer Coco's rendition to both,) the Boston Cream featuring surprising subtle custard inside a delicate yeasty pocket, and the apple fritter rife with fresh fruit beneath a delicate sugar crunch plus plenty of cinnamon rivaling some of the finest I've ever sampled; the best in Las Vegas by far."

We ordered the potato skins because it caught our attention being that it had chorrizo. Took quite some time before our order came out, too long for a place that was empty and for an appetizer. The potato skins were interesting and unfortunately a bit on the luke warm side rather than hot. It tasted like it had refried beans, chorizo and sour cream. The chorizo was pretty good and it made the plate worth it. The price was fair and service was alright. As far as going back, probably not. We decided to not get a cronut on the way out since the food was just ok, we didn't want to risk a disappointment.

It took about 45 minutes for our food to come out and when it did it was luke warm. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was gross and dry. I asked for more buffalo sauce and they brought me out a bowl of tasteless sauce that had been watered down one too many times. I definitely learned from my mistake and will not be returning here by choice."

Because of the time of day we arrived, we were given the breakfast menu.\n\nThe menu seemed like your typical diner food. The only disappointing thing is that they don't offer combo dishes. I ordered the cinnamon apple waffle but if I wanted it with a side of eggs and bacon, it was an additional charge (like $4 for each item!). But maybe I'm just used to the Dennys and IHOPs and whatnot.\n\nServers were polite but it took a while for our meals come out. We were told that they wanted to bring everyone's meal out at the same time (keep in mind we had eleven people). Unfortunately some meals weren't as warm as others.\n\nDespite that, food was ok. Everyone in the party seemed satisfied. The bagel and lox seemed like a popular dish amongst us.\n\nThe best thing about this experience: it was comped. Thank goodness for the gamblers in the group."

It was just the little dollop on top! \n\nThough the cream was delicious (as I read on yelp), the DOUGH of the DOUGHnut was dry as heck! I was very disappointed.

We came in pretty late when it was empty, so we just slipped onto a couple of the bar stools at the front.

I ordered your standard breakfast - eggs, bacons, toast, etc. - as a late-night snack, and it came out pretty much as you'd expect.

This was quite a draw, this women was stunning.  Although we were there for the food, why not something to look at as well.  We get seated and order some drinks.  After looking at the menu we realized that this place was just a cafe.  And where is this exotic employee?  Nowhere to be found.  BS.  A shit hole of a restaurant and misleading pictures.  I ordered the quesadilla and the lovely wife ordered the wings.  Both tasted like bar food......only worse.  I'm sure glad I had $30 left on a visa gift card otherwise I would've complained about the shit food.  The reason it was 2 stars instead of 1 is because our service was good and I was eating with a beautiful women.....my wife!\n\nWill I again?...  most likely not. Tootles!"

I went here 4 times during my trip (all for breakfast) and was not let down by anything, not once. By the last day i was looking for something wrong with the place but was hard pressed to find it. \n\nEvery day the hostess was nice, even genuinely asked us how our morning was going on the way to the table. Our service was great. Even with our special requests, time constraints and what not. It was near flawless. We were always asked if we wanted a mimosa or bloody Mary even though it was like 8 or 9 am!\n\nNow the food. Oh yea, the food! In the 4 days i went, i had Steak and Eggs, A bagel with lox, omelet with lox and 2 eggs sunny side with bacon.  In general all was well above par and blows any Denny's or IHOP out of the water. \n\nThe steak n eggs was about $15 and tasted better then many \"dinner\" steaks I've had in chain restaurants. The bagel with lox was a tad overpriced at near $11, but was delicious. The omelet with lox was good, but the lox were cooked. I sort of expected it on the side (idk why). it just tasted like a fish omelet to me. Strange but good. \n\nIf I'm back in Vegas in this area, I'd eat here again and again."

When I arrived at America I was seated quickly and brought water and coffee quickly, which in Vegas is a great way to start any meal.  Big old carafe of weak coffee is plopped down on your table within a minute of sitting down, and although it isn't the finest quality it makes up for it in quantity.  They have this giant tilted sculpted map of America that hangs precariously over your head as you eat.  I was seated under Texas and this did not make me happy, but examining the map/art thing was a great way to pass the time until my food arrived.  The service was quick and prompt, although the waiter forgot my smoothie on the first trip but realized it himself and was back super quick with it.  My breakfast plater thing had a good amount of mediocre food, that looked like it had actual veggies in it.  Weird.  Also the bacon had some sort of thickness (it was NOT thick bacon), but when you compare it to the bacon at a Denny's it was pretty divine.  I am pretty sure they had some kind of all you can eat buttermilk pancakes for a pretty good price as a special, but a lot of basic pancakes just didn't special to me.  I overheard that this is the food that they serve as room service in New York New York, so hopefully that helps.\nThings I like : Decor, Lots of coffee, bacon, hash browns, service\nThings I dislike: Smoothie (tasted watered down and also pricey)\nin the end these 24 hour places with decent prices are how I usually survive in Vegas for at least part of my time there, and I would return to America when I am dangerously close to extinction."

The restaurant was clean, not crowded and was a welcome respite from the strip. The wife and I were fairly worn out, very hungry and just wanted a quick bite before heading to our hotel to collapse.\n\nOur friendly server made a few suggestions from the menu, none of them appealed to either of us. We each just wanted something simple, we weren't looking for or expecting a fine dining experience. A nice, juicy hamburger with fries would do the trick.\n\nThe orders came out promptly and looked delicious. The fries were hot and crispy but something was definitely not right with the hamburgers. The texture was odd, they had no flavor and after peeling back the bun, no grill marks to show they had ever touched a grill or flat top. I'm 99% certain they were precooked, (maybe even purchased frozen and pre cooked?) then heated in a microwave. The bun LOOKED great but, while not stale, had obviously been around a day or two. We each left 2/3 of our burgers untouched. Paid the bill and left.\n\nPossibly they had an off night, but a decent hamburger isn't hard to do is it? This was our only truly bad dining experience in Vegas during our stay. I see other reviewers have had good experiences here ordering breakfast, maybe that's your best bet."

Only a few tables were occupied. Our waiter brought us water right away before we could ask so it was perfect. I'm sure he's seen it hundreds of times... The need to hydrate in Vegas is of the absolute importance. Ha!\n\nI opted for the bagel mania which is a grilled NY style bagel sandwich with bacon, eggs, ham and good ol' american cheese. It was delicious not only cause I was starving at the moment but the combination of ingredients was perfect. The cheese topped off the bacon, eggs and ham. And all those things were encapsulated in a perfectly crisp on the outside, soft on the inside grilled bagel. Delicious... It was just what i needed. It came with country style potatoes. That was pretty good too.\n\nMy friend got a rib eye steak and eggs. Loved it and scarfed it like it was the last meal on earth.... Satisfied customer.\n\nOur waiter was real cool.

It may not be the best thing you've eaten, but it'll fill you up and you know what to expect.\n\nI'm sad I ate here.  We should've gone to the Irish pub place or something instead.\n\nFirst off, they pretty much scorched the outside of my \"medium\" burger, then managed to make the bun into mush.  The vegetable side tasted like someone took canned veggies and boiled the hell out of them.  We barely got service, despite it being dead in there.  Everything was just kind of frustrating.\n\nThat said, you might not be bad off if you attempt dessert or breakfast food or something.  Maybe getting something pre-prepped is the way to go.  I say this, because any excuse to sit and look at the giant map sculpture thing for 30 mins. or so is fine if it's not like punishment.  That's the one redeeming factor here.\n\nSeriously, how can you be a bastion of diner style food and jack up a freakin' hamburger?!  That's all I want to know.\n\n~EEE~"

The prices were decent. \n\nIn short, good place to get a quick bite, but nothing for a foodie to drool over."

What made our meal so enjoyable was not only the food but the service we received by our server Manny, that we chose to eat there several more times before we left. We don't eat at the high priced restaurants so this option was just perfect. The menu has a variety of choices from  traditional breakfast items to your favorite sandwiches, salads and even some pasta dishes!  Sounds boring but trust me when I say everything we had was outstanding! I am Gluten Free for medical reasons and Manny took the time to explain my options and there were several! They even have Gluten Free bread for the sandwich choices!  He mentioned that he has only been a server for a short time, that he used to be a cook in the kitchen. Wow, what a waste of talent had he stayed in the back of the house. He was so upbeat, professional and a joy to be served by! We will definitely be returning and will ask for him every time.

It was not busy as this was around 2am. \n\nAnother time we decided to try again for breakfast, hoping the first disaster was just a fluke. The waitress was not very friendly and she never came around. She didn't even serve us our food or give us refills. We had several other people come around to do her job. The thing is, she wasn't even busy. She only had two tables. The place was dead. There is no excuse for terrible service like this.\n\nAlso, there was a very obnoxious drunk girl yelling at the bar for the entire time we had to wait for our food to arrive. At first this all seemed slightly amusing, I mean it IS Vegas. However, after awhile it was annoying and none of the staff seemed to give a darn about her behavior. No one told her to pipe down. She just sat there putting on a drunken show for the entire place, cussing and showing undies and falling off the bar stool. I guess this is what keeps the staff awake at 2am.

I needed to start with breakfast. I passed up 48TH and Crepes because the line was really long and there was no where to sit. My weariness led me to make the bad choice of choosing America.  I knew going on the food was overpriced for what they were serving but i was really tired after flight.\nI ordered the Chicken and Waffles and after waiting 20 min for my order, even though the place was slow, I saw my food and knew right away I was going to regret choosing this place. It came with 3 pieces of chicken which could have came fron a chick they were so tiny. I could tell the chicken was bought prepared and heated up. It had that familiar orangey color diner chicken has where the establishment is too lazy to flour chicken themselves. Lots of places actually serve this chicken and it's not bad tasting but it can easily be dry. Of course those tiny pieces were far from moist. The Waffles were crunchy on the outside and fluffy in the middle, nothing spectacular about the flavor. But my guess is that any place who doesn't take pride in preparing their own chicken, probably bought the waffle mix prepared as well.\nFunny that the restaurant is called America, pretty ironic. Lazy, no pride in your product, over charging customers, the buck you make is more important then the goods they are pedaling.  Is that what they are saying America is? \n The service was great, that's the only reason I gave them a star. Seriously how hard is it to make your own fried chicken?"

He was slow to bring the check, and never brought my water.\n\nThe one thing America has going for it is convenience, with its location in NY NY. Maybe I should have stuck with their doughnuts, those looked appealing..."

For a 24/7 town there's almost nowhere to eat between midnight & 7am which is more like 10am for east coasters.\n\nIt's reasonably priced breakfast for 2 for about $35.\n\nThe homemade donuts do look incredible."

I wish they would bring the medallion steak salad back. They have made some changes and I feel maybe they are trying too hard to be upscale. It's the America bar and grill after all so shredded celery with hot wings is a bit over the top. Overall great place to eat just wish some of the old menu items were still available."

We were pleasantly surprised by not just the taste but the size as well.  Well worth the money compared to other places on the strip.  I highly recommend giving it a try.  Ask for Chris if you do.  His service was outstanding despite being busy.  Manager also took the time to stop and ask how everything was."

(I was doing pretty good at the tables here)  Came here with my boys after spending hours at the tables.  They tried to get steak and eggs but for $13.99...ha no way.  I told them you might as well get the steak dinner and add eggs....overall you pay like a dollar more and you get a baked potato and veggies...I know I am so chinese.  The steak was not bad considering it was my 3rd one in a span of 24 hours....it was too big tho cuz I only ate half of it.  Great deal here...but its only from midnight to 5am I think."

Server was sweet though.\n\nAmbiance:\nInteresting decor. There is a huge decor of America in middle of room. High ceiling and huge place. There is a bar area where you can watch sports.\n\nFood:\nOne of the better chicken noodle soups I had where its not super salty to cover up the lack of chicken broth flavor. \nWe wanted sweet potato fries and our server recommended the brisket fries. Taste just like bbq meat on fries thats all it is. Its not bad though just nothing to rave about either. There is also way too many fat pieces on the meat i had to dig out. If you like all that juicy far, then this is for you.  \n\nCost: Fair"
