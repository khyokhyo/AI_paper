Terrible combo.\n\nHad the fried rice and spare rib thinking it was gonna be decent chinese food..EHHH!!!! Tasted more like Costco frozen fried rice, and ribs that were cooked the day before added with that sweet and sour sauce and placed back in the oven to be burnt. \n\nFor $25 my girlfriend and I weren't very please. Great service, not so great food.\n\nI was hungry and desperate therefore a cliff bar wasn't an option at 10 pm."

I also had the chicken and waffles. Warning though--it's boneless chicken and waffles. Can you say lame?\n\nMr. Lucky's is a godsend, however, after rough nights on the town. Also, the decor is kinda nice. They have old Vegas signs on the wall from random motels and such. The menu cover is pretty awesome looking too. Makes me wish I could grow a funny mustache!"

We were staying at the Hard Rock and asked an employee about good places to eat at 4am and he pointed us here. The menu looked pretty good, especially the breakfast items. I was about to order the country fried steak and eggs in an attempt to get somewhat of a fix since our Tuscany trip failed, but thanks to Yelp, I found out about their steak and eggs special! $7.99 when you order a drink. My group and I were really excited so most of us got the steak and eggs but a few were more intrigued by other items on the menu. I got a medium well steak with scrambled eggs and wheat toast. The portions were large! Two slices of toast both cut in half, I feel like that's a lot of bread. The eggs were great, but the steak was so so disappointing. It was so dry, I couldn't even finish it. I ended up wishing I ordered something else. \n\nTL:DR 3 stars for sad, dry steak."

And because I remember bits and pieces, I'll focus on the parts I actually do remember.\n\nThe service was pretty good, there were lots of people there but we were seated right away. We all pretty much knew what we wanted so they got crackin' on it right away. Probably had one of the best salads with ranch I've ever had in my life...I'm not sure how that is possible, but hey I'm telling you it was an awesome salad. Everything else tasted really good, the only thing was I asked for a medium rare steak and it was a bit too much on the rare side. But at any rate I still left full and happy!\n\nI'm going to make it a point to come back here (sober) the next time I'm in Las Vegas to try out the food again."

            "review": "They call it Mr. Lucky's @ HRH (Hard Rock Hotel).  More like \"Mr. Lucky for us it was opened at 7am in the morning!\" Nothing spectacular but from a quality perspective, an order of \"chicken fried steak & eggs\" after an evening & morning of heavy drinking was very satisfying.  Keep in mind, there were only 1-2 staff working at that time in the morning so don't expect customer service to be at the top of its game, however, it was good enough for us. During the day and early evening there's usually a full complement of staff on hand.\n\nPrice wise, there are some good deals and there are a variety of selections to choose from. Some ask, is it pricey? Well, it is Vegas you know. The venue itself is clean and a definite plus is the fact it is located within HRH which makes it convenient.  As far as seating goes, they can accommodate table and booth seating for larger groups. \n\nDefinitely consider Mr. Lucky's after an eventful evening at Body English or a day at REHAB."

So we head downstairs to go eat...\n\nWe end up at Mr, Lucky's and we got seated right away. Our server was pretty nice as well. My friend and I both got chicken and waffles...and I gotta say that it was delicious! The waffle was big and cooked very well, not too soft and not too crispy, just right! It came with a bunch of chicken tenders which was nice because I didn't have to fight through any chicken bones, and being a little drunk who would want to do that! The combination of sweet syrupy waffles and chicken tenders was the greatest  combo I have ever eaten...I had never eaten such a thing, even though I had been dying to try this famous duo. Their prices can be a bit high, but not outrageous. But what the hell, you're in Las Vegas! Cheers!:D"

            "review": "We ate here THREE (!) times on our most recent trip to Vegas.  Once for dinner around 9 ish, second for a midnight snack, about 2 in the am, and thrid for breakfast 11 am.\n\nFirst time I had the kung pao shrimp, I wasn't all that impressed, I've definitely had better. My accomplices had the steak sandwich (which she said was fab), french dip (another fab), veggie burger (ditto), and veggie omlette (ditto again).  So I was kind of disappointed by my choice when everyone else seemed to love theirs.\n\nSecond trip around, I had the potato skins appetizer, it probably set me back a few lbs on my diet, but it was worth it!  Or was it?  I also dipped into JM's chocolate fudge sundae, which was not that great, I honestly prefer the one at McD's.  My other girlfriend had an omlette, with the hugest serving of hashed browns I've ever seen (I should have let my fork wander over to her plate but I was too full from the skins).\n\nThrid trip before we left for home, one of the gals and I decided to stop in for a quick bite.  She ordered that french dip again, and I did the same... I asked to sub cole-slaw for the fries.  It turned up with fries.  (strike 1).  Sloppy waiter (Nicholas Cage look-a-like), wasn't very careful bringing the plates out and spilled the aus jus all over, so I had soggy bread.  (strike 2).  First bite.  (strike 3!).  I don't see how it can be so different from the other night when my girlfriend said it was delish.\n\nThey were pretty slow at dinner time too.  The only really good thing about this place was that it was convenient, being located in our hotel, and open all day and all night."

I had the HRC Breakfast, which was sausage, bacon and eggs, while Stephen had the Breakfast Quesadilla, and Stephen's mom had the Corned Beef Hash and eggs.\n\nService was excellent, and our server checked up on us frequently. The portions were more than adequate, and we could have easily shared 2 of the entrees.  Our server even offered to give us \"to go\" cups for our beverages, which I accepted.  Thumbs up to this place.  I'd come back, even if it weren't comped."

What came out was a massive plate of food to include eggs, hashbrowns, toast, and a huge cut of meat deep fried and slathered with gravy. I honestly only ate half of it before I was stuff and felt like I left a huge portion on the plate.\n\nTop notch."

It also happens to be the host for several annual events that I attend. So even though I have never stayed here I always seem to wander over to this off-strip hotel at least once during each Vegas visit.\n\nAnd since Mr. Lucky's is open all day, has decent prices and is conveniently located... it is my go-to stop whenever I get drunk munchies, regular munchies or just need a place to sit down for a while.\n\nMost of the time I order the Gambler's Special. It isn't on the menu but those \"in the know\" know that it is a sirloin steak, choice of potato, side salad and 3 skewered shrimp. It is only $7.95 and always has been. \n\nThe Gambler's Special is usually great. I have only had one bad experience where the steak was inedible. The shrimp has always been well seasoned and the salad is a decent side salad.\n\nOther items I have ordered are full size salads, sides of mashed potatoes and the hummus/pita appetizer. The hummus/pita appetizer is a large serving. If you are ordering it for only one person... don't order anything else. \n\nSome of the items can be a bit over-priced so I don't think I would order a regular on-menu entree. \n\nService can be great or lacking. Either way, the meal comes out quick.\n\nBonus: They now have a slew of flat screens to keep you entertained in case the people you are with are lame or passed out."

Serving, obviously, all meals, all courses, including desserts and drinks, Mr. Lucky's was a nice respite from the crowd for late dinner on a pre-New Years  Eve weekend.\n\nLocated inside the Hard Rock Hotel, it's easy to find once inside. We were seated on the spot and were visited by our waitress quickly. Water showed up almost immediately. Food didn't take long either. Hubby had a club sandwich that was more impressive to look at than to eat, according to him. I opted for the Blackened Chicken Alfredo. I probably wouldn't get it again. It wasn't bad, but I've had better almost everywhere. \n\nService was decent, covering pretty much everything. No big missteps. Not terribly friendly, but we probably didn't foster that either, being road weary and hangry. \n\nIt's...fine. You'll get a decent meal without spending a fortune; your mom would be happy."

Wow what a disappointment. First I will start off stating that the gentleman who took my order was very pleasant and quick with order. I ordered to chocolate cake without even looking at the menu. I wish I had because then I would have maybe seen that they add nuts to the cake and I would have ask for the slice without it. Anyways I get back to my room and break out the cake and after the first bite it was downhill. The cake itself was extremely extremely dry. The kind of dryness that comes from a cake made days ago and has been sitting out in exposed air....going forward I figured its just that part of the cake, but no it wasn't. I took a total of 5 bites throughout different parts of the cake all with the same disappointment. The only moist textured pieces of the cake were locked in between the frosting by even the flavor was lacking. Sadling I've had better chocolate cakes from home and my local grocery store equivalent to the price of and entire cake for a about dollars more. $8 buck and change plus a $2 tip for a Togo order that required little effort was an absolute waste of my money. Its sad that my first impression of this restaurant is tainted by a slice of cake, bit if the rest of their food taste anything close to that horribly tasting cake I'll pass. Mr. lucky I know my one comment is not going to make or break you, bit I do hope you rethink the chocolate cake, the baker, or the recipe to something more better tasting and worth the $8 your charging. If I wasnt so tired I would have taken the cake back downstairs and asked for my money back.."

When we finally did get seated our waitress was just as scarce as the hostess. It was easily 30 minutes before we finally got our order taken and she didnt even ask if we wanted anything to drink. This was when the place was only like 1/4 full. \n\nWhile we waiting for our food to come a table was sat to our right. They grew visibly frustrated as they waited...and waited...We told them it takes the girl like half an hour to realize she has a table. Eventually the manager, looking awfully professional in jeans and a polo, took their order and blamed it on his son \"falling behind\". So I guess his son was the cook, or one of the cooks...For how slow he was he's lucky daddy scored him a job. \n\nWe finally got our food and the waitress never even asked to refill our waters. Waters we only got because one of the bus boys brought it. We finished eating and knowing how useless our waitress was we just got up and asked for a to-go box ourselves. Then we had to find our waitress wherever she was hiding to get the check so we didnt have to wait another 30 minutes just to be able to finally get out of there. \n\nWe confronted the manager and all he could muster out of his useless mouth was, \"Yeah, I dont know what happened.\" Not even an apology. You're a manager and you dont know what happened in YOUR restaurant? How pathetic of a worker do you have to be? What happened was, the manager is useless and should be fired. He hired an equally worthless staff including his son. All of that equals a place that shames Las Vegas. \n\nI know Vegas is a tourist town and these places dont have to rely on repeat customers but for the love of all things holy, have some professional pride. If I was a manager and that was the experience I was providing my customers I'd quit the job because I obviously am terrible at it. This pathetic human being could care less what service he provides. It takes a special kind of crook to pull that off."

But then the next four meals really wore me down to the bone. The food was simply sub par. I don't think it helped that a number of the meals I wasn't sober (although my guess is most patrons will be n a similar state) but one evening I had there pad thai and it was literally the worst pad thai I've had. One of the worst meals. I don't know what it was about it but the quality was just terrible.\n\nThe service was helpful, tasty bloody mary's and even a breakfast option that I didn't need to make a single modification to--The Rehab breakfast. So thankfully, the final morning I found out about their pool side lounge restaurant, not rehab, and loved the experience there (the view wasn't so bad either). I can't seem to find that on Yelp though. \n\nLate night you can't do much else just don't get the pad thai."

However, overall its the best eating establishment at the Hard Rock for the price. Staff is generally courteous as well."

I have eaten at Mr. Luckys dozens of times in the past. It is pretty much just a diner thats open 24/7 and you can usually get seated with little or no wait. Food is average, service is average but I still gave it 4 stars simply because of the variety and flexibility of their menu...if you have a group of picky eaters that all have a taste for something different, this is the place to go. You want pankakes at 7:00pm...they've got em...you want a flatbread pizza at 9:00am they've got em. You name it and they've got it 24/7. Like I said the food is average but I have never had a bad meal or bad service in all my visits. The simple fact that I have eaten there so many times and never really had a bad meal or service puts them at a 4 star rating in my book and the fact that they usually have little or no waiting is novel in a town with no clocks LOL."

We have really come to appreciate and love Mr. Lucky's 24-7.   We eat breakfast there each morning during the show, plus, dinner or a late meal at least two additional times.  Total, were in the restaurant 5-7 times during each convention.  I normally order the same thing each morning which is the egg white Rehab Omelette.  It's fantastic, and really a healthy option when you'll be on your feet all day.  It's full of mushrooms, broccoli, green onion, and tomato, plus a large slice of avocado on top, and either hash browns or fresh fruit and toast on the side.  At dinner time, I have tried almost everything else on the menu. All of which have been delicious.    The real star of Mr. Lucky's 24/7 is the location. Located just off, and open to the main casino, the people watching is 2nd to none in the city.  This is especially true during the \"other\" convention that is actually being hosted in the hotel.  It's just never boring and we could sit there all night watching.  So much fun."

Not just vegas, but ANYWHERE!\n\nFor $7.77, you get a perfectly cooked steak, three pieces of grilled shrimp, a salad, and your choice of either mashed or baked potatoes, or french fries. It's not listed on the menu, therefore when you walk in all you have to do is say \"Can I get the 777?\" and your in. \n\nThis place was also featured on the Food Network's \"Best Thing I Ever Ate,\" bang for your buck special.

I was afraid we'd have to wait, as no good would've come from that. There were several other race participants at the restaurant when we got there, some still wearing their race day gear. Ick. \n\nAnyway, our waiter was fast and friendly, telling us about the specials of the day - from entrees to desserts to shakes - before leaving us with the menu. \n\nI know immediately what I wanted: the prime rib special for $7. It came with a baked potato and grilled shrimp. For seven dollars! I mean, come on! \n\nMy husband ended up ordering one of their massive burgers and the pumpkin pie shake. \n\nThe food, when it got to us, was yummy. The prime rib piece I got was massive, and I couldn't finish it. I had to wait a bit to flag down our waiter to ask for horseradish (who serves prime rib without the horseradish?), but used that time to dress my baked potato. They didn't really offer much by way of garnish, just butter and sour cream, but by then I was so hungry I didn't care. \n\nMy husband loved his burger, making quick work of it and the tater tots (an upgrade, of course). The shake was also very good, though the pumpkin pie flavor wasn't as strong as I would've liked. \n\nThis is one of those places I probably never would have ventured to, had circumstances been different. Still, I'm glad we went and that the food was delicious and the prices fair. Can't really ask for much more than that for a midnight dinner."

Nothing I've had has ever been horrible. But also nothing has been above average either. Service, for the most part, is usually always attentive and friendly. All in all, there are worse 24/7 spots, but there are also better ones. If you find yourself stuck or not wanting to leave the Hard Rock, this 24/7 spot will work out fine."

It's super laid back and the decor is very simple. It's a good thing they have rock and roll memorabilia scattered all over the walls and some nice plasmas posted to watch the game. \n\nWe came with the intent to get their $7.77 deal but somehow we ended up with salad, bbq wings and fries. My friends decided to share the chinese chicken salad and fries while I got the bbq wings. The waitress put enough thought into it and split the salad into two bowls to save us from the trouble of splitting it ourselves. We were very impressed! Too bad it didn't live up to their standards. They mentioned the dressing wasn't right for the salad. Definitely one of the worste salads they've ever had.\n\nI was Mrs. Lucky because I was pretty happy with my bbq wings. It comes with celery and carrots so you can get your vegetable servings for the day. The wings were super meaty and the bbq sauce was sweet with a bit of a kick. The waitress mentioned their popular flavor was the \"wild than,\" but I didn't want to take my chances. I'm not down with Tabasco sauce if you know what I'm saying. Overall, it was a solid meal but we weren't entirely over the moon about this place. Come to Mr. Lucky's if you want to grab something cheap and fast."

I knew it was at or by the Hard Rock. I never been to the Hard Rock, so this would be a first for that as well. \n\nI was expecting some run down place to be honest with you.

It's open to the casino floor so while your dining you can people watch. The staff here at Mr. Lucky's is very friendly and helpful.

They ask how you like your meat cooked and what dressing you want on your salad.\n\nI was a bit skeptical on the meal being so affordable for such a nice looking establishment. \n\nThe salad is served first, and it was not a small basic salad I was expecting. It was a pretty good portion garden salad that was very fresh with dressing on the side. The steak and shrimp came shortly after. Cooked just like I asked for. The shrimp however took the spotlight from the steak. It was goooooood. The steak was still satisfying and no complaints there.\n\nIf you are looking for a bite to eat and are on a budget, yet still want to impress, stop by here and order the Gambler's Special. \n\nAs an added bonus, we got a booth with some drunk club chick who was stood up by some guy who started hitting on some other club girls who were sober, while leaving the girl she came in there with drunk and falling over around in her booth, and then followed by throwing up all over herself and her table. Management came and spoke to her, didn't hear what he said to her but I have a feeling it was, \"I'm sorry but you are causing a scene and if you don't pick yourself together and leave we will have to escort you out of here\".

The first cut is always large, served with mashed potatoes, and a side of steamed veggies. The veggies are good enough to ask for seconds, but that is not part of the deal. After the first plate, you will begin to receive slimmer cuts of meat by itself. Truth be told, I am stuffed on the first serving alone, but I usually go for seconds to pretend like I'm getting my moneys worth. \n\nThe rest of the menu is over priced. Some friends will order burgers or corn beef hash, but I can never get myself to do so. Most of the time they seem less than thrilled with their orders which makes me want to veer off less. \n\nThe last time I went, the service was not satisfactory. Our server barely paid attention to us, probably because five out of seven of us ordered the special. Our drinks were not refilled in a timely manner, and everyone else around us looked to be higher priority. There have been times where we have received excellent service, but it seems hit or miss. Still a party of 7 with specials will get the bill to $70. If you provide good service, you will get a $14 tip. That is not something to frown upon."

Other than that, service was decent, and we kept getting our waters and coffees refilled. They also cleared out our plates as people finished their meals and they were able to split our checks into groups of 2 or 3 people, which made it a lot easier for us to pay. And because of that...extra star, otherwise this would've been a 2 star review\n\nNot sure that I would be back for breakfast unless I was stuck at HRH and didn't have a choice. I did see that they had an AYCE prime rib special on Sunday afternoons/evenings that I might have to come back and try, but only because I know I won't get gouged!"

Ever since I discovered the $7.77 gambler's special years ago, I feel like I must hit it up during each Vegas trip. Its one of the best deals going out there. \nI was here a couple days ago, and it looks like they are expanding, which is great news since this place can get crowded at peak hours. \nIt does seem to take a bit for your food too arrive, especially after a night of partying, but its worth it. I have never been there with anyone that didnt really like their food. \nLike I said, the gambler's special is great. Hard to beat a salad, mashed potatoes, a shrimp skewer and a well cooked steak for under $8. Its not the best steak you will ever have, but thats not why you come to a diner type eatery. \nDo yourself a favor and hit this spot on your Vegas trip."

I mean really its like they put a whole stick of butter in on each serving nom nom. I am thinking about coming here one of these days, ordering 3 large sides of it and eating it all shamelessly in some corner booth.\n\nThese Cadillac of potatoes is served the $7.77 steak dinner deal, which I think is the only reason anyone would come to this otherwise average casino cafe. Get a players card and ask the server about the deal, its served 24/7 but isn't listed on the menu. It comes with 3 grilled shrimp, a decent cut of steak, salad, and of course... the mashed potatoes that Jesus must have made. The $7.77 is sort of a poorly kept secret but something that alot of tourist probably don't know about. In fact, its probably the only reason I would even come here.\n\nOther than that, everything else on the menu is pretty average and very overpriced. $17 for a regular cheeseburger? pfff go to Burger Bar. They also have a pretty good happy hour that starts at midnight. This should be on anyone's Vegas cheap eats list."

Earlier today, It took 10 minutes total from walking in to receiving the nachos I ordered.\n\nThe downside was that the nachos were very American, which equates to gross for someone who has lived in San Diego for over a decade.  $18 for nachos with steak that did not taste much like steak.  To Lucky's credit, it's huge and will easily feed 2 people.\n\nThat said, I come here often and most of the food is good, especially the breakfast me he and the prime rib dinner, which only cost $18 and rivals what I've had at fine dining restaurants. \n\nI came back here again this evening to have the \"boneyard special\", which is steak, eggs, hash browns, and toast (I declined this item), which was delicious.  The best part: this entree was only $7.77 if you buy any drink with it.  It was around $9.59 if you buy it without the drink, so you might as well get what is equivalent to a free drink.  Delicious. The downside: this desk is only available from midnight till 6am.\n\nOverall, I recommend this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I would never suggest you go out of your way to eat here if you are not staying at Hard Rock, but this place has excellent service, above average food for a reasonable price, and it's open 24/7!"

I regrettably did not order the Gamblers Special which contains steak cooked to your preferred temperature, a skewer of shrimp, mashed potatoes, and seasonal veggies. The 777 special is only available with a Players' Card and is not offered on the menu. Instead, I ordered the veggie burger. If you have the players' card, however, most items di receive a $1 discount.\n\nIt is my belief that, within reasonable doubt, the hostess and servers are overworked and underpaid as we were greeted with a forced, robotic greeting, no eye contact and rushed tones. Our server was responsible for multiple tables and we had to flag her down just to get a refill of water and soda. \n\nWith regards to the food, about 60% of the order was accurate. The funny thing was that the orders with special requests were accurate, but the regular orders were incomplete often missing things like lettuce, sauce, or the side of toast. The veggie burger did not taste like Morningstar Farms (thank god) and was actually pretty decent for $13.99...Needless to say, I will not be returning to this location any time soon. The sub-par service matched with overpriced/adequate food encourages me to spend my money elsewhere."

But having just stumbled in from a night of quite a bit of drinking, I really just needed to hydrate. In this case, the boneyard steak and eggs on the Graveyard Happy Ending menu was exactly the booze mop I needed. Decently tender 7oz sirloin steak (especially for a plate under $10) with over easy eggs, toast, and hash browns. At 2am, it hit all the right spots. \n\nI sat at the counter and the late night manager/server was absolutely lovely. For all-day comfort food, Mr. Lucky's 24-7 is a dependable diner with great daily specials to boot."

The service was just fine and the prices were a little high for how good the food really was, however they do give a very fair amount of food. I believe this diner does well because it's the only breakfast place at the Hard Rock that isn't grab and go, aside from the Culinary Dropout which is open on weekends for brunch."

Our server was nice enough but he had way too many tables to give good service to anyone. \n\nExample 1: We got our salads AFTER our meal arrives.

If you have ever been to Mr. Lucky's and ordered their coffee, you'll know that it comes in these mammoth sized mugs so it takes the average person a REALLY long time to finish a cup. He never came by once to offer refills. \n\nExample 3: We had to ask another server for our check.

This secret special has been around for years.\n\n   The steak ranges from average to good. On my most recent visit parts of the steak were hard. And the mashed potatoes could of used gravy. If I were paying Bellagio prices this would negatively impact the rating. With a beverage and tip the $7.77 special adds up to approximately $14. In Vegas this is a value.\n\n   What isn't a secret is that Mr. Lucky's is the Hard Rock Hotel's [HRH] main restaurant. It is the go-to place when you want a meal or snack in HRH. Because it is in HRH, the music overhead rocks.\n\n  Contrary to some of the Strip casino cafes, Mr. Lucky's is expanding. There are additional tables and menu options. Recently they added to their Chinese food selection.\n\n   It isn't a secret that when restaurants offer a secret steak and shrimp special with decent service for $7.77, that a Yelper will give it 4 stars."

So this DINER, which serves up your typical cafe/diner fare is located inside the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. \n\nWife and I....... well mostly I, was starving after a night of a little drinking. We stayed at the HRH and I definitely needed some coffee ASAP. We arrive and are promptly seated. Its a decent sized dining room with a wide open floor plan. We are given our menu's, and my eyes are instantly fixated on the french toast sandwich. Im a sucker for french toast to begin with, but in a sandwich?! Bring it! Our waiter comes around to drop of our coffee, and take our orders. If you have been paying attention, what am I going to order???? Thats right, I ordered the french toast sandwich which is packed with eggs, a slice of ham, american cheese and bacon. It is served with hashbrowns on the side.\n\nLet me just say that it was nothing short of amazing. Everything in the sandwich tasted great. The ham was juicy and tender, the bacon and eggs were cooked to perfection. Of course hashbrowns are always great no matter what. The wife ordered eggs, 2 pancakes and a bagel. Her pancakes unfortunately tasted like they had been re-heated.  Still good. Just did not have that moistyness you love in pancakes. Other than that it was all good.\n\nThe service from our waiter was awesome. He was always making sure our coffee did not need refilling, and always checking up on us. The service was spot on.\n\nOverall I only gave it 3 stars due to the fact that this was our first time here,and would have to try out some other dishes before giving it anything else.\n\nBut so far it is off to a great start."

For two of those weeks, we ate at Lucky's .  Overall we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and creativity of the food, though i have to ding them a star given that if not for the freebie, the prices are a little on the high side ( though the steak special is a great price. )\n\nThe highlights:\n\nChocolate chip pancakes ($11) - chocolate chips and the ganache were high quality.  The maple syrup - delicious.\n\nChicken Tenders ( $11 ) - very crunchy and flavorful\n\nFire roasted chicken nachos ( $12) -  the chicken was so-so but we LOVED the cheese sauce.  Suggest you ask for the sauce on the side since for some strange reason most, if not all the sauce is at the bottom of the pan so not easily accessible.  Regular cheese is melted throughout the pile.\n\nmini-corn dogs ( $9) -  five \"mid-size\" corn dogs had great crunch, and a decent beef hot dog.\n\nNY half-half ( $18 ) - corn beef/pastrami - i personally did not try but my fried said it had a large portion of meat and tasted great.  Slight ding for the bread being a little soggy.\n\nReuben sliders ( $12) - we ordered without sauerkraut.   perfect combo of pastrami, cheese and thousand island and the rolls tasted great.\n\nBleu Bacon Cheeseburger ($14) - i was surprised how good this burger was.  I suspect some might feel it had too much bleu cheese.  I personally like more cheese.  The bacon and grilled onions and the juicy pink center - Yummy !\n\nSpaghetti and meatballs ( $14) - need more sauce the two times we ordered.  Interestingly, they used different spaghetti both times.  spaghettoni the first time and standard spaghetti the 2nd time.  The meatballs were tender and great meat mix.\n\nChicken parmesan ($16) - big chunk of chicken, crispy and nicely coated.  Side of spaghetti.  The garlic bread is below average.\n\npics added\n\n\nAverage/below-average :\n\nMac and cheese fried bites ( $7) - more cheese please ( maybe use the queso sauce from the nachos !)\n\nDesserts - not much of a selection.  we tried the shots of dessert ( $3 each; 5 for $10) The cherry cheesecake was good.  The creme brulee - ok.  we actually ordered the heavy metal banana split but later canceled the order - i'm guessing that was the dessert star !\n\nNext time i hit Hard Rock for a concert, definitely going to Mr. Lucky's after."

I've lived here in Las Vegas for 13 years and dined at Mr. Lucky's 24-7 numerous times, mostly after my guests asked about it and/or to take advantage of the dinner specials (e.g.: the \"off the menu\" $7.77 steak & shrimp dinner).  Sounds like a great special, right?  Well, THAT'S where the experience always derails at Mr. Lucky's.  First, the wait staff tends to greet you and treat you like they're doing YOU the favor of taking your order; they ALWAYS seem to have chips on their shoulders, which dampens the whole tone of being in the hip surrounds of the Hard Rock Casino/Hotel.  Second, they don't tell you that you have to order other items with the off the menu specials, like drinks, and it can get a little testy when THAT shoe drops.  Finally, especially with the $7.77 steak & shrimp deal, while the shrimp are usually just OK (often overcooked and spongy), the steak has ALWAYS BEEN AWFUL!  Every time I've purchased this meal, hoping it would be satisfying, the steak was a grisly, chewy, over-cooked shoe-sole slab of meat that tasted awful.  It has NEVER been a pleasant experience!  In fact, you'd be lucky to consume more meat than fat, gristle, bone or other un-chewable portion of the low-grade steaks they serve.  It's as if the \"chef\" deliberately asks for the worst shoe-leather grade beef from his purveyors to make this meal.  Shameful!  Here's a tip--go down the street to the Ellis Island Casino and Brewery (on Paradise and Flamingo), where for $9.99 you can get a delicious higher grade steak meal with steak, potato and salad AND a choice of freshly brewed beer or root beer (both which are brewed right there on the premises)!  The ambiance is a big step down from the \"hip\" Hard Rock, but the you WILL walk away thinking \"WOW! That was a really good meal!\"  SO, SKIP MR. LUCKY'S and head to ELLIS ISLAND JUST DOWN THE ROAD!  You'll get much more Lucky there. . ."

            "review": "My 3 friends and I ate at Mr. Lucky's for breakfast twice. The first time it was take out; I picked up all the food and brought it back to the room for everyone to enjoy. We were delighted with our delicious breakfast! We raved about it so much that we decided to sit down in the restaurant the next morning, to each order a different plate than the morning before. The next morning, we found the place packed to the brim. We were waited on by a very courteous and friendly server but it took forever for our food to arrive. When it finally came, everything looked just as amazing as the morning before; pancakes were fluffy, omelettes loaded and cheesy, and fruit ripened and scrumptious. We were about 5 minutes in to a conversationless calorie fest when suddenly, a small creepy crawly creature decided to join in on our meal. He boldly scampered his way to the right side of my plate, stopped, moved his little antennae, catching my eye. Now I have to admit that I have seen roaches before, and I'm not saying this was a roach. But damn it, this had to have been a distant cousin, because familiarity seeped in, and I jumped up and screamed! I caught the next woman with a badge on her shirt, and unsteadily exclaimed, \"there's a bug!!\" She swiftly grabbed a napkin (I'm sure she didn't want to alarm the already-curious neighboring guests), captured the bug, and then surprisingly calmly proceeded to ask us \"do you still want to eat here?\" To which I replied, \"hell no!\" She then said, \"I understand. I will take care of it.\" \nHer quick reaction, as I discussed later with my friends, told a story of the past; this has happened there before. They have seen these bugs there before. This may not have been the first time.\nMy advice, if you decide to eat here: Granted, none of us fell ill. Just know that if you dare, you may have to share your food with some 6-8 legged critters that are braver and hungrier than you."

I thought cheap dinners like this would only be found in downtown Las Vegas.\n\nThe service was fast, the patrons who were there were eye candy- my guy friends can vouch for that, and the prime rib was soooo good. The mashed potatoes and the veggie which accompanied it was also good- but the mashed potatoes was better. I ordered my prime rib medium well and it was soft and juicy. Dipped in horseradish and au jus (sp?), it is the BOMB! I considered ordering a second plate like all of my other friends, but my clubbing dress wouldn't permit another plateful. I will definitely come back here again (with looser clothes on). And the best thing about it is that this yummy AYCE prime rib dinner is the same price of one drink at the bar.  Love it!"

Heck, we even came here last year when I attended one of my good friend's bachelorette party in Vegas.  I always order their $7.77 special.\n\nThus, I am taken aback by our most recent trip here in January of this year. I came with my fiance, and my family. I wanted to show them what I knew about cheap eats in Vegas. It was their first time there, and Honestly I left feeling empty and disappointed. First of all, they wouldn't let us sit at the table that we wanted to (due to special restrictions), and second of all, they took almost 15 minutes to get to us. The first time, the manager came by to tell us, \"I don't know who will be serving you.\"  Finally, after 15 mins, the same annoying manager comes over and tells us that \"she'll be the one serving us.\" She asked me what we wanted. I said six waters to start and six orders of the $7.77 special. She made the most disgusted look (of disdain/or did she just smell some stinky fish?), and proceeded to give me attitude for ordering this many specials.\n\nCome on WOMAN, you really think I'll come here for your other dishes? They're annoyingly overpriced and no I would never step foot into Hard Rock had it not been this special - theres absolutely NOTHING special about the Hard Rock or the ambience. Just a bunch of Bros/and white trash walking around, and at this point I can vouch for you that the manager is no different from the said demographic. Sorry to state the truth. Can't handle it? Well, too bad.\n\nAnyway- so she gives us this major attitude and stomps off. Who knows, she may have even spit in my water, but I thoroughly examined it to see if there were floating loogies (sp?) and low and behold, NONE! Ok anyway, so after the food comes out/and we're eating, she basically asks us in the most \"fake\" tone...how is the food going? But was really short on us.\n\nHonestly I just wanted her to go away. Her attitude was UNCALLED for and unprofessional. She made my family (who-for them it was their first time) feel uncomfortable. It also showed that she judged us for ordering this meal just because it was cheap. So what? It doesn't matter how much our meal is, $5 or $500, we should still be treated nice and like human beings. That's what Tip is for.  And that, my friend, is why we only tipped $.25 cents. Hahha.....bwahhaa I hope she realizes her downfalls. Bitch!"

It's a decent place to chill before  heading out to party or gamble.\n\nI used to frequent Las Vegas quite a bit and we used to come to the Hard Rock to chill. Had so many memories and some entertaining ones.  Like the time we were up all night in the wee hours of the morning seated and looking at our menu.  The next thing we know, I see a transvestite walking into the restaurant. Of course, my friends stare thinking it's a woman. Lol.. He/she meets ups up with a group of transvestites. While we're ordering, the next thing we hear are glasses being thrown and tables being knocked over. That's right, a transvestite brawl!! One was on the floor holding back the other preventing the other from stabbing him/her with a butter knife.  Security came in time to break it all up. \n\nOr that time when we saw some drunk guy wearing his shirt backwards but wearing it like a crop top and wandering side to side and double fisting his Bud Lights.\n\nOr the time we were rolling dice on the crapps table with Bruce Willis.\n\nI miss those days..."

We usually order the French toast and a quesadilla. The French toast is usually really good, hot, crusted with corn flakes and crispy. The quesadilla is as expected, nothing spectacular but still good. This time I don't know WHAT was going on. First off after we sat down and told out waitress, Paulina we were not ready she walked away without saying anything (I'm sure working in a 24hr spot in Vegas is not easy but still there's no reason to be rude). After we figured out what we wanted and placed our orders we asked for lemons for our water. We waited approx 20 min for our food. During that time we never got our lemons, nor did Paulina check in on us. When the food did arrive, Abby brought it to us. She was very pleasant, asked if we needed anything extra (at that time we asked for our lemons we never received from almost 30 min prior) Abby, brought them, along with the rest of our food. Now let's get to the actual food in this story. The quesadilla was not hot, the cheese was not even melted. The temperature was just above the cheese crumbling. The French toast which is usually an unexpected bonus, was a total disappointment! It was barely room temperature and the flavor was completely off from what it usually is. After the disappointing food, we waited another 10 minutes (at least) to get our check ( from a different server) and ended up having to pay the bill at the front counter. Mind you it was not like the restaurant was anywhere near full. Abby, thanks for being a bright spot in a disappointing trip to Mr. Lucky's. Needless to say I will not be returning to this establishment any time soon!"

Well when they finally decided to take out order I ordered the Belgian waffle with strawberries and my friend ordered the bagel sandwich. Lets just say we were thoroughly disappointed 45 minutes later when the server brought us our food. My waffle was hard and cold, the 2 strawberries they put on it were sour, and the syrup was ice cold. I flagged down a waiter somehow, told him, ordered something else, and when that came back I felt the need to read reviews immediately. This place is horrible. So thoroughly disappointed.

Lucky number 7 was on the money last night. Sure I was a little drunk from the Open Bar event at the pool, but I'd have to say that was one of the best steak specials I've ever had. It's not as cheap as the $3.99 Steak and Eggs at South Point, which is pretty good in its own right, but you get what you pay for. The cut of meat was pretty flawless and cooked perfectly. You also get a skewer of 3 shrimp, a mound of mashed potatoes, and a side salad.\n\nTo be honest, the steak is on the small side, so that might throw you off a bit in this land of plenty. However, I'd argue that it's the perfect size. A couple of people ordered the all-you-can-eat Prime Rib for $9.99. I tried some that was cooked medium and it was tough. My steak blew that prime rib out of the water. I convinced my cousin to get another done medium rare and it was much better, but still not as awesome as my steak."

Everyone knows that a steak dinner sounds the best when its 1am and you're in Vegas!\n\nSo, the steak dinner or the \"Gambler's Special\" is a steak cooked to your liking, a hefty amount of mashed potatoes, sauteed green beans and three grilled shrimp on a skewer. This special is not advertised anywhere on the menu, you have to ask your server for it. There are a few conditions to this deal-- you need to purchase a drink. It can be alcoholic or non-alcoholic. You also need to sign up for their players card beforehand, so you can get the special price of $7.77. If you do not have a players card, you pay $10. Not bad at all.\n\nEven at ten big ones, I think that this vegas steak special is worth it! I have tried my fair share of steak specials from Ellis Island and other casinos, but Mr. Lucky's has the best quality by far. I've heard from a few friends that this deal has changed over the years (you can even read about all the changes in the yelp tips and the reviews, this deal has been around for a while)-- but even with all the changes, I still think this deal is delicious!\n\nThey also have tons of drinks specials (4 for $10 shot) if you are in the mood.

He actually ate his!  That's saying something!!  \n\nNow the portions are probably on the small side, but they were more than enough for J and I.  I was a little worried that J would still be hungry afterwards, but said he was stuffed!  We were not expecting much from a steak dinner that costs less than $8.00 and were pleasently surprised!  \n\nWe went back a total of 3 times in the 4 days we were there.  The last being Monday morning for the $6.99 steak and eggs breakfast (steak, 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast).  Its $4.99 if you have a players card.  \n\nService:  \nFriday Night - Seemed our server had other things on his mind.  \nSunday Night - Improved.  A little more attentive. \nMonday Morning - This server ROCKED!!!!  We were techinally 2 minutes late for the steak and eggs special, but he gave it to us anyway.  On the ball with the drink refills.  \n\nI definitely think Mr. Lucky's will be a regular spot for us on Vegas trips in the future."

Me and by boyfriend were talking and waitress didnt bother to at least say, We will be with you in a momment, I went up to her and asked, So what do we just sit our selves or what?  She replies that a waiter will come to seat us, I said \"ok.\" Our server was friendly but our food wasent the best. I like to eat some chicken nachos with ranchero sauce and when I got it they gave more chips than anything, not enough chicken. They werent that warm either. If I could give this negative stars I would, Bottom line, It nothing special and is expensive for the type of food. Will never come again."

It was alright but not worth the money I paid. For $26, a steak shouldn't taste like it was fried on a hot plate in a trailer park somewhere.\n\nOur server was a friendly, high-energy guy with lots of drive. He re-filled my Coke three times without my asking him to. Me made us feel welcome and stopped by several times to see if we needed anything else. He's too good for this place.\n\nMr. Lucky's is a loud busy atmosphere too. If you want a quiet dinner, this ain't the place.

The 777 special still rocks at a good value although I've gone for the upgrade 999 more often than not, but so much has gone downhill with every aspect of the place from their slow service to the total lack of attention to the customers, to the poor food, and the very prevalent wrong food sent to wrong tables or extremely  incompetent servers . (I don't normally hold many servers at fault for incorrect food being served but as an example of the last 2 times I went there vegetarians were served actual sausage and gluten free people were served cartoned eggs and white toast.)  I want to love this place again but maybe as it has grown the charm and good service have been lost too.

However, this place, like most of Las Vegas has gone seriously downhill.  They USED to have BOMB chicken nachos, where they actually sauteed the chicken and administered a wheel barrel of cheesy delight.  Not anymore.\n\nI embarrassed myself by bragging to my out of town guests about these nachos.  The chicken on the nachos are now cut into tiny cubes and microwaved, making it chewy, rubbery, bland and disgusting.  Minimal toppings of any kind.  I asked the server what happened?  He claimed he didn't know what I was talking about, this was the way they were always made.  Came back a few months later hoping for a different cook.  Nope.  Same nasty crap.\n\nPressing my luck for a third time at Mr. Lucky's, I ordered the ahi tacos and left with a severely upset stomach which turned into food poisoning.  I was out of luck going to Mr. Lucky's.  If you stay away, lucky you!"

The good thing was that I got blue cheese and it was real and there was a lot of it. The burger it seemed was not freshly ground and was thin, so it cooled quickly.\n\nThe second time I got Lucky's club and it was simply enormous ($12.99). To make a dent I had to deconstruct it. The turkey meat was real and not that processed stuff. I got cole slaw on the side and it was delicious, juicy and not too much mayo. \n\nOverall, the food here is pretty solid and I would return."

The only good value is the famous off-menu $7.77 special, which gets you a salad, steak, shrimp, and mashed potatoes. It's decent enough, like something you'd make at home. The rest of the menu items are actually a bit overpriced, I think, for the quality. Service is good, the atmosphere is like your typical casino coffee shop, but you have to put up with the blasting Hard Rock music."

I did not mind coming here, since I have never heard of them before and will be a new restaurant to try.\n\nBoy, I am glad that we ended up here at the HRH's version of an all night cafe.  Because their off the menu specials, which everyone at the table all know about (except me), are some of the better deals for Las Vegas.\n\n$9.99 AYCE Prime Rib (comes with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables).  The prime rib was tasty, and definitely one of the top meal bargains in all of LV. And compared to the $3 sodas, the value proposition is a no brainer.\n\nIf that is not your cup of tea, they have $7.77 Steak and Shrimp.  Pretty cheap for what you are getting.  Again, definitely an attractive offer for those saving their money for other expenditures (gaming, alcohol, etc.).\n\n\n\nMr. Lucky's 24/7 now features two new graveyard specials for guests to enjoy daily from midnight to noon.\n\n* New York Steak & Eggs - 8 oz NY Steak, two eggs, hash browns and toast for $4.99 or $6.99 (without Rockstar Players Club card) \n* Burger Basket - classic old-school burger and French fries for $3.99 or $5.99 (without Rockstar Players Club card) \n\nBesides these specials, they also have a diverse line-up of food that is on the menu, from Breakfast, Chinese, to Burgers and Pizza.  Definitely something for just about anyone, at a low-end price range for a major LV casino property.\n\nService was good, considering how busy the place is.  Never had to remind them about refills, getting seconds on the prime rib was fast.  \n\nConvenient and fairly accessible location, even for tourists.  Price is excellent.  Food overall was good.  A trifecta of winning combination sure to please guests of Mr. Lucky's 24-7.\n\nYay! I'm a fan!!!  4 stars."

Opening the heavy class doors as you enter you are greeted with the sights, sounds, and smells of Vegas. People gambling, the ringing of the machines and the smell of cigarettes. You walk though the hotel into a \"food court\" style area with different restaurants and clubs to choose from. \n\nMr. Lucky's didn't seem to really shine in the middle of the other places, but we entered anyway. You stand to be seated, which only took a few minutes. The waiter was friendly and quickly got us our drinks and order. All we said was \"two 777 deals\" he then kinda quietly asked us how we liked out steak and quickly left. Not sure if that was to hide the deal from others or that was his personality. The meal was surprisingly good for only 7 dollars YES 7 dollars for Steak, shrimp,salad and potatoes. The meat was cooked as ordered and was nicely seasoned and tender. The shrimp had a great flavor and was seasoned nicely. The potatoes were almost whipped and had a very smooth texture. I was very satisfied and full after finishing my meal.\n\nThis is something you must do while in vegas especially if your on a budget.

Others in my party were not as disappointed as I was, but I really was sad about my meal.  The eggs, ordered \"over medium\" which is supposed to have a runny yolk and firm white, had very runny whites.  The grits were tasteless .. I had to add a lot of salt and I rarely need to salt anything except eggs at breakfast.  The shrimp was definitely not even recognizable as whole shrimp and definitely not blackened.  The sauce was marginal and pretty spicy even for a Cajun-type breakfast.  I shared a side of pancakes, which was decidedly the best thing I ate, and the Farmer Brothers Coffee was good.  This meal was on Super Bowl Sunday so maybe the cook wasn't paying attention ... but I wouldn't go back.  I couldn't even finish the skillet, and that wasn't because it was too big :(."

But as such places like Firefly, and Joes Crab shack, this place has just FELL OFF!  First, I ordered a Luckys Bloody Mary because it was served with a celery stick, a slim Jim, and belvedere Bloody Mary flavored vodka. Well I do not believe I was served even one of the 3, they simply got a house Bloody Mary from the closest bar. We ordered (between the party of 3) a chicken fingers appetizer, 2 locals $7.77 specials, and a half&half sandwich. (Half pastrami half corned beef) Now let me first say, I don't expect much when I order a $7 steak. Other than it to be cooked, medium, how I ordered it. Instead of bloody and barely warm. My shrimp- undercooked and fishy. The only good thing on the table was the pastrami which is why this review has 2 stars instead of 1. Did I mention our food and apps all came out at the same time? Before the people who were next to us and ordered before we arrived. I could see their flames of anger as we were served. Also, the service was just eh. Not horrible but by NO means good. Bottom line, this place knows the tourist keep em alive, so what's the point in good food and service?! It's officially off my list of late night dining options!"

We had to order a drink to accompany this steak special and it could be either alcoholic/non-alcoholic. The reason why I gave this place a 3 star is because there were certain things on their menu that was way overpriced. The menu didn't mention any additional costs. We ended up ordering a loaded baked potato that came out to be $7- almost as much as the steak special. If you're watching your wallet than be careful what you order, otherwise it might end up being very costly."

Get the $7.77 steak and shrimp deal! What a steal!! It might not be on the menu anymore but just ask for it and they'll give it to you! \n\nThe steak was SUPER salty and the quality isn't so great but the portions are huge! And it comes with 3 big shrimp on a skewer and a side of mashed potatoes. It's seriously an amazing deal for the amount of food you get. And they're open 24 hours which is a plus! Great for a cheap late night meal!"

Ask for it and you get a surprisingly delicious salad (their honey mustard dressing is the best I've ever had perhaps), mashed potatoes, and a shrimp skewer and a decent sized steak. Great deal in Vegas.\n\n...and apparently, there's a $9.99 All-You-Can-Eat Prime Rib special? WHAT?! WHY WAS I NOT INFORMED. That's a great deal anywhere, much less Vegas. Has to be the best deal in the city. \n\nI'm mad at my inside sources. I was not informed of this prime rib deal. I feel cheated. But then I kind of cheated everyone else who paid $12 for a sandwich.

Fair-sized steak, three broiled shrimp, potato, vegetable, salad, $7.77. Not on the menu, you have to ask for it, which gives you an insider status with your server and with your friends who you tell about it. And in my case it's been dozens of friends. \n\nThis year, the steak & shrimp was a disappointment. The steaks were uniformly tough and gristly, the salad is now a $1.99 add-on, and your choice of potato is mashed and that's it. There used to be garlic in the mashed potatoes and they served it with butter for the shrimp and/or potatoes but the shrimp has a spicy rub on it now so butter would be superfluous. The vegetable -- there were garlic green beans and broccoli -- was fresh and well prepared, but by then it was too little, too late.\n\nYou also need a players card, adding a little inconvenience (especially if the server never asks to see it) and the service is spotty, with some servers STRONGLY recommending ordering a drink and others totally cool with whatever you choose to order or not order. \n\nI can't recommend it any more."

The rest of my group loved the shrimp and even the green beans. So I definitely recommend this special even after the extra hoops you have to jump through."

I went for the noodle bar which was being advertised outside the restaurant. Too bad the noodle bar is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays... and I was there on Monday. Instead, our FABULOUS waiter Anthony suggested the teriyaki bowl which I had with chicken and the teriyaki sauce on the side. He even went and got me some of the chili sauce they serve through room service. He really made our dinner enjoyable. I had enough leftovers to last for TWO more meals. \n\nWe also had the chicken nachos as an appetizer because one of my friends could not wait until a beer or two in to order/enjoy dinner. Surprisingly they weren't super heavy. I didn't eat much of it but there was still plenty of leftover after three of us attacked it. The queso was really good, the chicken was tender and Anthony brought us the garlic habanero hot sauce (which wasn't so hot but definitely tasty) which topped off each chip nicely.\n\nOne of our friends ordered the chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Very rich but SO good. We all had one bite and were happily satisfied. \n\nWe also had the $25 off $35 from restaurant.com which worked out great. For the nachos, $7.77 special, teriyaki bowl, dessert and 3 beers we paid $35 including tip and tax. The portions make it worth it.\n\nThe trip I previously made to Mr. Lucky's involved late night eating after throwing back a few drinks.

This place was hopping at 6PM but there were still available tables although seating at the counter seemed to be a popular choice.  We were shown to a big booth which I preferred over a table and chairs.  The menu has all day breakfast in addition to sandwiches, burgers, and salads.\n\nI wanted something 'lighter' than my previous dinners we had in Vegas where the portion sizes were big so I decided on the Lucky's turkey club sandwich with a salad.  The side salad was a decent size served on a plate.  Nothing special with iceberg lettuce, other vegetables, and the dressing on the side.  The sandwich was 2 halves served with a pickle.  It was like the other meals, and very big portion.  There was so much turkey in the sandwich, it was more than I would eat on Thanksgiving and I could barely fit it in my mouth.  I ate half and gave my husband most of the other half.  Although lots of food, turkey was a little dry.\n\nFor $12, lots of food to devour.  The server was good at bringing us refills on our drinks.  Decent food and service."

Food is good. Price ---- good. If you are in the know, there is a special meal non--menu meal for $7.77 that is worth at least double this price. Just make sure to mention the secret code (hint, look at the price). The steak is a bit chewy, but does the job for the less fickle eater.\n\nRecommend the American food, not as much the Chinese menu. Nachos appetizer are perfect, especially after a night out at the club! \n\nIf it wasn't for it being located right in the heart of the Hard Rock Casino, it would be a typical diner atmosphere that could easily be called Denny's. Luckily, it's located in the Hard Rock Casino!\n\nRock on!"

However is it open 24/7 in a city that never sleeps, you bet your ass. It has gone through renovations along with the casino, but is a great late night eatery or a place to grab a bite after you have gambled all your fun money away or better yet treat you friends to a late night meal after you have cleaned up on the casino floor. \n\nOverall the five star is more for their convince, than the service and food. I always enjoy what I eat, however, the price would dictate a four star rating (its a little crazy to want nearly $15 bucks for a basic 2 eggs, toast, and bacon meal. The late night service is still decent, its a bit slower obviously at 4am with a smaller staff, but its filling and you can order from breakfast to dinner."

I'm obviously here for a reason... So when one of them finally spoke to me all she said was I'll be right with you and went to assist the table behind me! \n\nSo I was over it by that point and didn't feel like giving them another chance anymore. So I went next door to culinary drop out to hope for a better experience and just get something to eat! - awesome food & awesome service!!!!

A group of us six girls got seated right away and everyone seemed pretty happy with their food. I ended up ordering a pesto chicken sandwich that came with a side of fries and a pickle. The only complaint I had with my dish was the bread fell apart as soon as I bit into the sandwich. Probably from the oil or whatever they used to make the chicken. The second visit, a group of us (four) decided to grab some late night grub. I ordered the chicken quesadilla, which was grease heaven. It was a mediocre quesadilla. My friend got a banana split and you would naturally assume that would take the least amount of time making out of quesadilla and a flatbread pizza. We had to flag down a different waiter to check the ETA of the split. Our waiter came a few seconds later to tell us it would be out soon. The banana split was pretty big...definitely enough for two to split. Halfway as my friend was eating her split, another friend had asked if there were bacon bits in her ice cream. That would probably explain why her split tool so damn long. We're thinking that they had completely forgotten about the split and were in such a hurry that they accidentally grabbed the wrong shaker. We first thought maybe we just missed the minor detail that bacon was on the split, you know since there's such a big bacon craze. We were laughing by the end of our meal...I wish I had taken a pic...maybe next time!"

The first night we went about 2am we got seated right away and had quick service. Food was so so, my only gripe about my first visit was the cheese fries. Instead of using shredded or even regular cheddar cheese, they used nacho cheese which made the fries really soggy and gross. All the plates we ordered were large in size and had to take to go boxes for our food.\n\n\nThe second time we ate here it was during Rehab. We had called the front desk to ask what the dress code was cause we were just wearing swimsuits. Front desk put us on hold to probably ask someone who knew how to answer the question better and was told that dress code wasn't enforced until 6pm. So that being said we showed up to Mr. Lucky's to only be turned away because we were in swim suits and we were required to wear bottoms. It's one thing to let us know hey sorry there's a dress code and it's actually enforced all day long rather than giving us a dirty look up and down saying \"front desk doesn't know anything. It's been the same rule for like...forever.\"\n\nAll effin right beezy! No need for the attitude! So I suggested for her to get in contact with front desk to let them know the rules so that they aren't misinforming hotel guests and yet I got another smug look.\n\n\nYet she continued the attitude and was trying to shoo us away when another waitress came up and offered us to order to go. The nasty waitress with the 'tude was pretty snappy when I asked for my cheese fries to have shredded cheese instead of nacho cheese \"we always serve it with shredded cheese\" and I quickly served her back with \"well that's not what we were served last night!\"\n\nAnyways besides my rant, everyone else seemed pleasant but like I said Mr. Lucky's is only good because it's convenient and cheaper than the other restaurants Hard Rock Hotel has to offer."

One of the biggest problems now is the servers are not well trained and many apparently cannot think for themselves.\n\nWe'd had steak & shrimp the night before so we skipped the special this time: big mistake.  While the Chinese chicken salad (ripped off from Wolfgang Puck) was OK (but a little bland and over-dressed,) the turkey Reuben was awful and what was advertised on the menu as fresh rotisserie turkey didn't appear to be anything close to that.  The best thing was the White Russian spiked milk shake.\n\nMeanwhile, while our waiter kept coming over and asking us if we needed anything, when we said we did he never did anything about it.  For instance, when I ordered the milk shake, my brother asked for an extra glass so he could taste it...it never came.  Even though we made it clear we were sharing the sandwich and salad, no one bothered to bring side plates, (which should've been obvious,) and even after we asked and they said they would, no one ever did.  (It was not crowded!)  We only got mustard because one of the bus staff was more on the ball than the waiters and saw that we needed it.\n\nAlso, this is just me, but any 24/7 casino joint ought to have a shrimp cocktail on the menu.

First the busboy brings our water and Sasha does not greet our table for 15 minutes and when she does she says \"do u know what you want?\"   Does not even get our drink order we order a quesadilla appetizer, we wait for over 35 minutes before we even have anyone approach the table only because I grabbed the bus boy and ask where our food is.  He leaves and another 15 minutes pass when Sasha brings our order out and she says \" I put your order in but the kitchen didn't make it sorry. My manager saw I put it in on time. Management never came to our table to apologize or give us a comp not even a dessert and  Sasha does not refill the tea once. She brings our bill and we pay promptly and for the first time ever I gave a crappy tip of 1.01. Thinking about it now I should of left her nothing maybe she could get the tip from the kitchen. Point being is we would of never had to wait like that had she checked her tables to start with."

Since we are off the strip, I worried that we wouldn't have anywhere to go without a taxi ride, but then, we found Mr. Lucky's. \n\nI enjoyed my experiences here. We actually ate here three times, and each time it was fine. My husband devoured the tater tots that came with a massive container of ranch. We both had the 7.77 special, steak and three shrimp with mashed potatoes. Everything was fine. For 7.77 I wasn't expecting Carnevino-quality food. I loved it, and it was perfectly cooked in every way.\n\nThat night, a standard drunken breakfast was in order, so I got steak and eggs plus some breakfast potatoes. From what we all remember, it was all delicious, perfectly cooked over easy eggs and the steak was again cooked a perfect medium rare.\n\nThe next morning, we hobbled into Mr. Lucky's after a very short wait and sat for breakfast. Up to this point, the service was fine and our food came out in 12 minutes. This time, the service was okay, but our food took almost 30 minutes to get to the table, and the waitress didn't stop by to inform us of the longer wait until 2 minutes before the food came. By then, we already knew it was going to be a longer wait for food.\n\nMy sister got a Belgian Waffle that had a guitar design in the middle of the massive waffle. My husband said it was good and she said it was okay for $15. I liked that it had the design and was geared towards the casino crowd.\n\nMy sister's boyfriend ate steak and eggs which was again, fine. My husband got the huevos rancheros and they were surprisingly good but needed a little heat and spice to make it even better. I had the corned beef, and it was not too bad. I like my corned beef has to be a little crispy on the edges and with a little less potato, but it was fine and I enjoyed it.\n\nDon't expect fine dining here. It's a 24/7 spot and amidst being near Nobu, it doesn't advertise itself as anything other than a nice diner with casual eats and decent service. If the restaurant is busy, know your food is going to take a while, but if you're worried about that take the shuttle and go to the strip and get something else.\n\n*** UPDATE ***\n\nMr. Lucky's (and most of the restaurants at Hard Rock Casino)now has a gluten free menu which includes gluten free pancakes and a gluten free Belgian pancake. I did try the Belgian Waffle with chocolate chips, and even though it wasn't anything incredible, I love that they are even more GF friendly and that people with this allergy have more options!"

The steak has always been cooked to my liking, mashed potatoes have varied between buttery, creamy goodness, or delicious chunky bites, and the salad is a nice complement even though I don't even like salad!\n\nTo me, this is a 5 star meal for the quality and price. There are 2 stars missing from my rating because every. single. time. I have visited this diner, the service is wack-tastic. Especially the last 2 times when I had the same lifeless, blunt, unpleasant and slow server. Short for no reason (in manner, not height) and just someone I would not want to interact with. I'm pretty sure my demeanor is friendly and respectful at the least so there is no reason to come at me with that rude ish. And WHY does it take 15 minutes to get a check when my food is obviously gone? I hate looking around like I lost my mom at the grocery store (we are actually both short in height so that has happened quite a bit).\n\nIt won't hurt to come here for the special, but make sure you are in the mood to not let anyone ruin your experience."

Awesome drink to order once. Service was great too!"

            "review": "Granted, every restaurant should have great service. But c'mon, you gotta do some research to find the path of least resistance. So here's the advice on that path for Mr. Lucky's. Use your casino card to get off-the-menu steak and shrimp for 7.77, must order a drink with it. Sit at the counter to get the best service, watch when your food comes up, and get it hot and fresh. Don't be afraid to send it back if not cooked right. The shrimp was delicious tonight, buttery light charred garlic herb outside and moist tenderness inside. I had to send the steak back because it wasn't cooked as specified and a really tough cut of beef. They corrected it quickly and replaced the first 3 shrimp that I already ate, awesome! It was cooked perfectly the second time. Our server, Niki, was pleasant, made good suggestions, and didn't get flustered although she was slammed. Even the green beans were tasty enough to finish off, garlic and butter seared. This place is good but they will tend to understaff it to cut costs. So be smart from the start."

I ate the eggs benny even though the eggs were over cooked and the hollandaise sauce was horrible, but sent the prime rib back.\n\nI asked the waitress if their prime rib was good before ordering it, she lied.  It was the worst piece of beef I had ever received eating out, anywhere.  I've had better prime rib at local greasy spoon diners.  It was tough, and flavorless.  Even the mashed potatoes were trash.  Who screws up mashed potatoes?  \n\nThey should just close this joint along with the rest of the renovations going on at the Hard Rock.

The person that answered confirmed that they were still running it and that it was everyday from 2pm-8pm.  I even called back again to hopefully get a different person to answer the phone and confirm this information. No dice... Same woman answered and confirmed. So I decided to drive down there from Summerlin. When I arrived the same woman said that this special was only on Saturday and Sunday. She claimed that she there was a steak and shrimp special everyday from 2-8. It's quite amusing/unbelievable to confuse ayce prime rib with steak an shrimp. SAD!!! I think that person's only job was to greet,seat, and answer the phone. Decided to not donate my money to this fraudulent establishment. seems that I'm not the only one that feels this way since the hotel is a ghost town."

I've stayed at the HRH tower before, so being so close by and staying a few days in town, we had to eat here at least once!\n\nThe decor is pretty nice! They have a rather large space and can accommodate quite a bit of people at any given time. Prices here aren't bad. The breakfast here isn't to die for but it isn't bad either. I've had the chance to eat breakfast food and also things like the chicken soup. \n\nOverall it's a place to check out if you're staying at this hotel. I can't ever think of any good places to catch a breakfast so late and this place definitely comes in handy on my Vegas trips. I hope they've bumped up their customer service since  I was last here in Feb. It was the worst! My waiter not only forgot our drinks, neglected our table, and did nothing but talk to other workers, laugh around, and talk to what looked like customers that were just standing around waiting for who knows what. When those people left, our waiter still took his time getting our meals that were already plated for a while. \n\nAlthough disappointed,  I know that miserable experience won't discourage me from neglecting this place. I have had too many goods here to reflect on this one bad."

Value and quality has certainly dropped since I began going to Mr Lucky's in '96 when the steak and shrimp special was $5.95 and you weren't required to purchase a beverage and included a salad. The lemonade back in those days used fresh squeezed lemons not the powdered/concentrated crap they use now.\n\nThese days, you can still find the off the menu steak and shrimp special (show your players card to get the deal), but for $7.77 minus the salad (really? how much money did you save by taking off the salad?!) and you are required to purchase a drink ($3 for a soda/tea/lemonade) so in reality, your special is not so special at $10.77. The steak, I believe has also shrunk in size since the special began. The two things that remain awesome is the grilled shrimp and the garlic mashed potatoes. \n\nService, even sitting at the counter is spotty at best. \n\nIf you happened to look at the menu for other food, it includes overpriced breakfasts and other items. \n\nI guess if you are starving at 3-4 am, drunk, and don't want to stumble anywhere else outside of the casino, this will fit the bill, but I won't be rushing back here anytime soon. Instead, I will head over to Eillis Island for the steak, potato and beer special (which includes a salad!)"

GJ Yelp :) \n\nMy wife and I had just gotten out of an MMA competition and were STARVING! Of course, I jumped on the Yelp app, which lead us to \"Mr. Luckys\". I glanced through some \"Tips\" and saw that they have a $7.77 gamblers deal, which was off the menu, and sounded great. After we were seated, our waitress came over, took our drink order and asked if we had any questions. She told me I had to have a players \"Backstage Pass\" to get the $7.77 deal, and directed me towards the players reward desk. She was nice enough to put the order in while I went and picked up my card. \n\nMy wife and I ordered the \"Chicken Nachos\"(refer to pic) to start. They were good. The cheese, which was smothered throughout, was gooey, deliciousness. The nachos weren't amazing, but they were very good and they were served on a hot skillet. Pretty cool presentation for sure. The $7.77 special(refer to pic) came with a salad, (looked like) 8oz Strip Steak topped with 3 grilled shrimp, and mashed potatoes. It was rather large for the price, and extremely tasty as well. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium. It was very juicy and flavorful. The shrimp, on the othe hand, were rubbery, and I actually forgot they were on the plate until I looked back at the picture I took. My wife ordered a bacon cheese burger, which she thought was good, but nothing special. \n\nThe restaurant started to become packed, so we didn't want to keep the booth occupied for any longer. The waitress, even though she was noticeably busy, was still on point, and got us out the door in no time. The only thing I noticed while enjoying my meal was, all the servers, and food runners were not happy, and walked around like they were the s#%$. I know, I was in the \"Hard Rock Hotel\", but at least look a little happy when all these guests, including my wife and I, are putting $$$ in your pockets.

I tried to come here once around 1am or 2am and the line was prohibitively long so I just haven't had the chance to try it out.  Lucky for me (see what I did there), I had a meeting at Hard Rock this week, and it turned into a breakfast meeting.\n\nI generally dont eat breakfast during the week, so this was a rare occasion for me.  I tend to save my breakfasts for brunch or when family is in town.  My plate of Huevos Rancheros would definitely fit the bill for either one of those occasions.  The tortillas underneath were crisp and the beans weren't mushy.  The ranchero sauce was chunky and spicy.  The best part is that there wasn't an oily layer of cheese like you'll find at Egg Works.  All in all, this was a pretty damn good plate of food.\n\nI came here recently for a breakfast meeting, so keep in mind that I wasn't necessarily paying attention to the service or the attentiveness of our server.  She did leave a pot of coffee on the table for us, and I do recall her checking in at least twice - but we had a computer out and it was pretty apparent that we didn't need anything else so I won't say it was any reflection on her.\n\nI'm only giving this three stars, however, because the prices are a little steep - bordering on room service prices.  I understand that this is a casino diner, but it's still a diner (and it's not like this is Center Strip).  Their standard breakfast of three eggs, hash browns, and a meat runs $15, and a short stack of pancakes is $10. \n\nPricing aside, I'll definitely come here again.  It's a nice place to know about if you're in this general area and want some decent breakfast food."

We had been duped into the counter seats, but we wound up enjoying the kitchen view so it all worked out in the end.\n\nI appropriately ordered the \"Rehab\" Breakfast, which included \nscrambled egg whites with mushrooms, sauteed spinach, sliced vine-ripened tomatoes, and my choice of toast or English muffin.  My eggs were well-seasoned, and the balanced plate satisfied every inch of my weary palate.  A delicious glass of freshly-squeezed orange juice was also included, which provided the necessary dose of sugar to energize for an afternoon at the pool.  My friend's Smoked Atlantic Salmon plate included a crisply toasted bagel, red onions, capers, sliced tomatoes, and cream cheese.  The salmon slices were perfectly smoked and salted.  \n\nMr. Lucky's was a great option for affordable Vegas dining around the clock.  The atmosphere was purely diner-centric, but the food surpassed expectations."

It used to be a good value and a decent meal.  However, I went yesterday and asked for the gambler's special and was informed by the waiter that the deal has changed.  Now you need to have a player's card (one per table) from the Hard Rock to get the $7.77 deal and you must purchase a beverage, which brings the price to over $10 at the very minimum.  If you don't have a player's card or don't want to go get one (signing-up for one is free), the gambler's special is $10 plus the purchase of a beverage, which will bring your total to over $13 at the very minimum.  I was told by our waiter that the policy changed just a short time ago. \n\nOne last thing I'd like to comment on is the quality of the gambler's special itself.  It seems that the quality of the meal has gone down over time.  It's just not as good as it used to be.  I hope this review helps."

It included scrambled egg whites with mushrooms, sauteed spinach, sliced vine-ripened tomatoes, lettuce, and a choice of bread or English muffin. The eggs were cooked just right and there was a lot on the plate. Along with whole wheat toast and a huge cup of coffee this hit the spot.\n\nThey also have a few late night specials which are not usually on the menu - a \"secret\" $7.77 steak and eggs that is pretty darn good that I had a few times, and a $9.99 all you can eat prime rib deal which starts at 12 midnight. Who says you can't eat good for cheap in Vegas anymore?\n\nService is cheery and attentive with some cute waitresses. This place is a scene for late night people watching, and kinda fun especially after a big concert lets out. Sure, it's a glorified diner, but where else can you listen to great rock music while chowing down? Rock on! \\m/"

That is if you get anything off of the specials menu otherwise the food is somewhat pricey for the food where you can go anywhere else on the strip for a better deal.\n\nAlways check out the specials that they have to offer when I was in Las Vegas we stayed at the hard rock and I ordered the famous triple 7 special which comes with a steak, potatoes, shrimp for $7.77 and the steak and eggs for $4.99 remember to show your rockstar club membership to get the discounts and to double check your receipts just to sure they get it correct.\n\nOverall next time I'm at the Hard Rock and its 4am going to stop back in for my fix."

So here is my bottom line:  we sat down and thought the waiter was a nice guy but we ended up buying $24 worth of burger plates that were just OK.

So as far as value goes, this is as good as it gets. It seems like not many people eat here, but it may just be that not many people are in the Hard Rock Casino in the first place.\n\nNow for the actual food part. My first piece was cooked to perfection. A nice thick slab of meat that was tender, moist, and very flavorful. My second piece was very different, quite dry, and not too tender. These cuts were also very different in size. So this lack of consistency is definitely what will hold this place back. Another problem I had was that they didn't have any beers on tap, which is a BIG problem in my opinion. How can you not have ANY beers on tap? \n\nSo for the value I give 3 stars, but as far as the food goes, nothing to write home about. 3 stars."

Personally, I prefer to venture away from the specials here because there are so many gems tucked away throughout the offerings.\n\nThe Fire-roasted chicken nachos would be just another order of good chicken nachose except for the cheese sauce - in my lifetime i havent found a finer queso. Its heat comes from the fire-roasted peppers and its creaminess versus most heavier cheese sauces makes it a great appetizer (most nachos ruin the meal for me).\n\nDont hesitate to explore the apps - there's not a wrong call in the bunch and the diversity allows you to create some interesting sampler platters (build-your-own).\n\nYou cant go wrong with a burger or pizza, but I've found myself at Lucky's at 3am more often than not, so breakfast is usually my urge, and the all american breakfast plate always satisfies.  For the meat, request the apple chicken sausage and youll find out what makes this breakfast special versus so many in Vegas.\n\nFinally, dont leave unless you order a coffee and chocolate shake (i usually order one with my drink to get an early start).\n\nThe service is almost always on point, but the Hard Rock gets busy a LOT so try not to go after shows, after the clubs let out, or on weekend nights if youre in any hurry.\n\nAtmosphere-wise, there are a number of tvs over the diner counter, Americana,especially Vegas-themed, scattered about the walls, and the casino is right outside and open for you to watch the gamblin' fiends.\n\nThe price is casino-average, with most meals costing 10-15 each.  Last i checked, Lucky's is on restaurant.com and you can get a certificate for $25 off of $35.\n\nFor you travelers, the Hard Rock is conveniently located near the airport and a fairly cheap cab ride in... make this your first and/or last stop in Vegas!"

Turns out she was Randi from www.savelv.com, which is a really great online resource for finding free and discounted things to do and eat around Las Vegas.  Aside from being a good resource for food deals, she also knew some interesting Vegas factoids (like that the tallest Christmas tree on display in the US was this year was a 109 footer at M Resort, north of the Strip).  Taking her advice on steak deals around town, our hero made a mental note of the off-menu special at Mr. Lucky's in the Hard Rock casino for the next morning.\n\nThe $7.77 secret special for an 8-oz. steak, mashed potatoes, and 3 shrimp on a skewer is a steal of a deal that's available 24/7.  It comes with a basic (but fresh and leafy) salad as well.  Our hero had his steak medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection with nice blackened criss-cross grill marks on it.  The cut of the steak was surprisingly good for the price and was very tender and moist.  Our hero's hungry and hungover cohorts ate it extra slow so that they could savor the juicy meat.  The mashed potatoes on the side were excellent and tasted very smooth and creamy.\n\nEven if you aren't lucky at the tables, you can still get a lucky deal on a meal at the Hard Rock!\n\nPROS:\n- Excellent off-menu $7.77 steak and shrimp special.\n- Friendly service that checked up on us frequently.  Even the manager walked around and personally checked on all the diners.\n\nCONS:\n- The regular menu items are somewhat limited and they have an odd combination of Western and Chinese food to choose from."

The menu isn't anything special, basically typical diner fare, possibly a notch above than a traditional diner. The look & feel is Vegas retro with a throwback vibe. Service is usually pretty good and prompt.\n\nPlenty of folks referenced the $7.77 special, so I won't go into it here.\n\nWorth checking out if you're looking for a late night or early morning bite."

The eggs were decent, but the hash browns had way too much butter (or margarine?), and the ham was well, ham, with grills marks to boot.\n\n3rd day I had the chicken noodle soup, opting to avoid any more wasted calories at this joint.

He definitely was very considerate and patient, especially considering that it was around 6 am in the morning and that he had a few \"knocked\" out customers experiencing one of their worst hangovers ever (not me, I was one of the people taking care of them).\n\nAnyways, we stopped by here because we met up at the wrong place (originally thought it was the Hard Rock Cafe). We decided to stay and eat here instead. Joey was very patient because around 1/2 the people were ready to order and a few weren't, so he made sure to come by and check every so often to take our orders. He supplied us with water to drink quickly (especially for those hung over).\n\nI ordered the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK with HASHBROWNS, WHOLE WHEAT TOAST, and my EGGS OVER EASY. Mmmmm..... Three of my friends decided to order the SIRLOIN STEAK AND EGGS for $17.99, which truthfully, I thought was a little expensive. I think we came at the wrong time because I'm reading all these reviews about how the steak and eggs are no more than ten bucks? Ehh... \n\nAnyways, another reason why our waiter was cool was he gave us updates on our plates, so that we weren't randomly sitting their waiting. When our dishes arrived, mine looked like heaven!!! I was so famished. \n\nMan, a bite of that CHICKEN FRIED STEAK.... so delicious with the crispy, crunchy outside and the juicy inside all covered in a savory sauce. When my friends, the ones who ordered the steak and eggs, saw it, they regretted their order and wished they ordered the same dish as me. They were so jealous. My eggs were cooked over-easy just the way I ordered, which makes me very, very happy (I like dipping my toast in the yolk). \n\nFurthermore, I'm a \"Yay! I'm a fan\" with this place becasue of their service. Joey was very considerate of my friends who were out of it and were trying their best to eat if they could. In the end, we asked for a couple of extra bags to bring in the car just in case. Instead, he came out with several bags and a hand full of napkins in case anything happens in the car with them throwing up and all. Really great person."

Therefore, if you like sides, you should ration them out as long as you'll need them. \n\nThe sides weren't that special. Veggies, mostly- green beans and squash. However, the potatoes were heavenly. \n\nI must add that my to-go portion was eaten without utensils as we failed to ask for them with our meal... still worth it. \n\nMy second trip was the night after as I was searching for a sandwich. The turkey club with chipotle mayo did the trick.

We were pretty hungry and this seemed like a good quick fix. Had the $10.99 prime rib and shrimp special. It was pretty good. I have definitely paid more for worse prime rib. They also give you three decently sized shrimp that appear to have been cooked on a flat top with a nice little crust. Be sure to get the creamy horseradish to round it out. \n\nSecond time there was for a quick breakfast prior to heading to the airport. I had the pancakes for $9.99. It's a stack of 4 enormous pancakes. The vanilla butter it comes with is a must do. The menu says it comes with maple syrup, but I'm pretty sure it was table syrup. Nonetheless, pretty tasty. Coffee was a bit steep at $3.99 but whatever. At least they had soy milk. \n\nOverall, great option for some solid, fairly priced diner food. Everything came out pretty quick, and service was friendly."

I actually really enjoyed it! \n\nFor $7.77 you get a salad, steak, mashed potatoes and 3 small shrimp.\n\nThe salad was well, a salad. The steak was tender. The mash was yummy and the shrimp needed a lot of lemon but was otherwise good.\n\nI have to say I think I will be back for this. Or for any of their other really cheap late night specials."

            "review": "I wasn't able to partake in the super cheap NY steak and eggs combo that everyone else is raving about in their reviews so I'm going to judge this based on the two unfortunate meals I had there.\n\nMy first and main incentive on eating at this place was to get a \"Pass the Line\" / VIP stamp to use at the hotel's big concert venue, The Joint. I consider myself to be a seasoned concert attendee in Las Vegas because I go to Vegas at least twice a year for shows. But it's only as of this recent visit that I've been told about about this Pass the Line VIP thing for the Joint. If you're familiar with this program at the House of Blues establishments, it's almost the same thing at the Joint where if you order an entree or spend a certain dollar amount (not just drinks), you can get in another line that gets you in the venue before the regular general admission line does. \n\nSo I find out this information about an hour and a half before doors are set to open and I run over to Lucky's, sit at the counter and tell them I'll need the cheapest, fastest meal I can get so I can have that Pass the Line stamp. Even though I sat at the counter thinking I'd get faster service, the wait for an available server must've been at least 8 minutes. When the server came by, he suggested the chicken tenders. The order came by surprisingly fast. But no amount of ranch or barbecue sauce could've helped those dry and rubbery chicken breast pieces. McDonalds chicken nuggets taste better than this crap. I ate at least two of the four pieces to try to get my money's worth, paid my meal, got my stamp and ran over to the VIP line at the Joint. \n\nI should've left the Hard Rock as soon as the show was over but my feet and back were killing me. (How could you not  dance your heart out and lose your sh*t watching Arcade Fire?) I thought I'd give my feet a good rest before heading out again so I went to Lucky's one more time to see if they could redeem themselves. It was only 11 PM so I was an hour too early to get the steak and eggs. I went with the sliders because I didn't want a huge burger or sandwich and not that many places can mess up sliders, right? This was the worst set of hamburger sliders I've ever had. The buns were dry and seemed like they were days old. The meat was tasteless and too thin. I was annoyed the sliders didn't come with french fries, and after the server told me a side order of french fries was huge, I just went with hash browns. The hash browns were ok and that was the only part of my meal I enjoyed. \n\nMr. Lucky's 24-7, you are on my Las Vegas sh*tlist. I always have good meals when I go to Vegas, and after eating here twice, I'm only going here if I desperately need that Pass the Line stamp."

It took at least 10 minutes for them to even get waters out to our table, even longer for our actual beverages, and waiting for the food was a nightmare.\n\nWe waited roughly an hour for our food to even make an appearance; what appears to be the manager comes out with two of our dishes with no mention of an apology for the food being so late. About 10-15 minutes later, the rest of our food arrives, one meal of which was done incorrectly so we had to send it back. They were transitioning from breakfast to lunch and we saw people getting their lunch food during that hour we were waiting for our food, so it was extremely frustrating to see that.\n\nThe waiter, very nonchalantly and awkwardly, mentioned that our food took so long because sports were on tv. Not an apology, not an excuse. It's March Madness in fucking Vegas. Put more people on staff. Thanks.\n\nThe only reason I am giving this place an extra star is because it was actually a pretty tasty breakfast. Would I go here again, though? Absolutely not."

I'm suggesting future customers to plan going to Vegas in an economic way by trying out this Cafe inside Hard Rock Hotel and Cafe.  Two of my other friends who went with me ended up ordering the same exact dish I suggested.  Everybody left the Cafe extremely satisfied.  The dish was only $7 before tax and tips.....can't beat that for the size of the New York steak they provided!!!!\n\n~Hope this review helps those who are planning a future Vegas trip~"

My mom loved the green beans and mashed potatoes, everyone else not so much. My husband said the shrimp was chewy and over-seasoned, probably to mask the poor quality of the shrimp. Most people who rave about the gambler's specials are intoxicated while consuming their meal, so there's that. 2/5 \n\nVEGGIE BURGER ($13.99): A veggie burger made out of lentils and nuts piqued my interest, but the burger ended up being completely boring, taste wise.

I ordered a MED WELL and got more like a MED RARE each time out. That was fine with me at that price what a deal They also have a burger basket for 3.99 that is pretty good also. \n\nI got the 7.77 which was nice but I prefer the STEAK and EGGS that is for sure it seems more like a full meal. The 7.77 is like a snack to me. ON FRI AND SAT it can get pretty crowded and there is a little wait. I cannot wait to try the AYCE PRIME RIB for 9.99 when I get back there."

The meat was not so tender, but for the price, it was definitely worth it.  4 people with drinks come out to 57$ plus tips.  Plus the deal is available 4pm -4am, pretty much the time when you will be awake at vegas.  \nEnvironment is great.  You are sitting right next to the casino at Hard Rock, with great music bumping all the time.  Every once in a while you will hear cheering with people winning bonuses or big bucks at the tables!"

Late evening both times, the service was really slow in a nearly empty restaurant, and the BLT in particular [with avocado added] was dry, boring, and not worth the money. I regretted ordering it.\n\nEarly morning, in a nearly full restaurant, and the service was smiling and faster than I'd imagined it would be. They kept checking back, and the California omelet [three eggs, avocado, tomatoes, artichokes, onion sprouts, goat cheese, minus the quinoa] was amazing. \n\nLate morning the next day, there was the same full restaurant, same great service, and the Bacon Blue burger [melted blue cheese, applewood bacon, caramelized onions, avocado] was the best I've ever had. I was in heaven, and almost considered staying longer just so I could have it one more time.\n\nI could be wrong, but I got the sense they put their better servers and cooks on during the morning rush. Not sure I'd bother with Mr Lucky's again before 3 am or after 11 am. But in between those times? I'm all there."

The restaraunt is convenient, service is relatively good, but extremely uneducated in regards to food allergies (I will go into further explanation).\n\nAfter a week of coming here as I have been staying at the Hard Rock, I have been pondering where on earth I was afflicted with cross contamination. I have been enlightened today by my server (Marvin) who has gone above and beyond.\n\nThe menu has a few gluten free options... pancakes, Belgian waffles.... great, except I don't care to get fat on this trip, and well, those gluten free options are not dairy free. Little known fact (apparently), many people who suffer celiac disease cannot consume dairy..\n\nI have learned how to piece together meals at restaraunts where the staff are not properly educated/aware/trained/give a shit  about food allergies, but I deal with it by asking questions and making myself knowledgeable of things I need to avoid. Despite my efforts to check what I could eat on the menu and  the reassurance of the staff (prior to Marvin) I have gotten sick and remained sick throughout most of my time here in Vegas. The culprit? The couple of times I ate hashbrowns and a salad where after consuming 2/3 rds of it, I found pieces of croutons. \n\nIf you peer at the menu you would see hashbrowns arent listed gluten free, I ask about the ingredients for each item (yes my body has forced me to be that person) and every single time until today (tuesday-monday) I have been reassured of the hashbrowns being potatoes and oil ONLY. The non gluten free aspect was simply the toast. Wrong, most hashbrowns use flour to make them crisper and these are not the exception (thank you lazy servers for not only making me sick but compromising my immune system for a couple of weeks).\n\nSo the food here is good but if you need to avoid anything in particular I recommend going elsewhere, unless of course you encounter the server Marvin who was capable in helping me find something to suit my cravings as well as dietary restrictions (corned beef hash utilizing the corned beef from the Reubens vs. The breakfast where it is cooked in butter and so on so forth).\n\nNext year, unless something dramatic happens, Mr. Luckys will not even be considered a last resort for food. This was by far the best meal I have had here and most likely my last."

There was about a 10 minute wait before my party of 7 was seated. I ordered the Classic Rock entree which is your typical breakfast food - eggs, toast, hashbrowns and your choice of sausage or bacon. Food came out hot and was pretty good, however I didn't find it to be anything spectacular. Some other entrees my friends had ordered were their country fried steak, omelette burrito, and the aloha - all that looked a lot more tasty than mine! The proportions were decent and the prices were moderate. \n\nDinner on the other hand, not so great. We noticed on Yelp that they had a $9.99 prime rib special, but apparently it was only available on Sunday nights!! There was another special going on that evening (or should I say morning at 2am) which was their steak and shrimp special with a side of mashed potatoes and salad for $7.77! What a DEAL right?! Well, you really do get what you pay for! The steak I thought was super chewy and I took two bites of it and was not able to finish the rest. The mashed potatoes were salty as heck and I was NOT the only one who thought so!! The chef's taste bud was totally off that night. Of course we complained, but the waiter was rude and said there's nothing he can do about it and that's how the mashed potatoes are seasoned. Considering I was incoherent, I spooned him some mashed potatoes and told him to try it himself and tell me it's not salty!! He walked away careless of what he had to say with no sincere apologies what so ever! But moments later, the jerk waiter returned back with complimentary fries along with the remark of telling us he told the chef to add no salt to the fries because we don't like salt. (Okk...whatever!) \n\nAnywho, breakfast here is pretty good. The dinner here may also be great, but I would highly recommend you not to order any of their dinner specials! It comes with a side of rudeness topped with extra ATTITUDE if you don't like your meal!!!"

However, it took a little longer to have our food order taken. We each ordered the Gambler's Special, which is $7.77 for steak, 3 shrimp, mashed potatoes and a side salad. We were asked by the waitress if we had a player's club card. We told her that we didn't have one, so she told us that instead of $7.77, the cost would be $9.99. Had we known this, we would have signed up for a player's club card to get the discount. Having our hearts already set for steak and shrimp, we proceeded with our order.  We also ordered a few adult beverages - My hubby ordered the Monster Circus and I ordered the Blushin' Russian. \n\nThe reason why I give Mr. Lucky's 3 stars instead of something higher is because of the wait time and the quality of food. When our orders came, my husband's steak was cooked medium instead of medium rare like he asked and my steak came out completed well done, when I had asked for it medium. I thought about sending it back, but by then I was starving and in no mood to wait for another steak to be cooked.  The steak and shrimp were just ok. Nothing spectacular about it. The mashed potatoes came unseasoned, so we had to salt and pepper it ourselves.  Overall, for the price, the Gambler's Special isn't bad at all. Our drinks were really tasty, no skimping on the alcohol either. You can taste it, but not in an overwhelming way. \n\nI'm not sure if we'll be back, but I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cheap, decent meal.

Carol W ordered the California Omelet, a three-egg omelet with avocado, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, quinoa, onion sprouts, tomato, and mushrooms folded in and served with a side of hash browns and toast.  We noted that despite a nearly full dining room, we didn't see a lot of food coming out of the kitchen.  We waited...and waited...causing me to wonder if we'd have time to eat without inhaling our food.  Almost 20 minutes later our food arrived, and as expected, it was a big plate of food.  The contents of my Waffle Wich were bountiful, savory, cheesy, and filling.  The waffles were light and fluffy, but were also just plain Belgian waffles, lacking that \"something\" like sweetness that would've provided a contrast with the savoriness of the other components.  Perhaps a bit of maple syrup served on the side?  I should've asked for it.  I ended up eating everything but the waffles.  Carol's omelet, though, was delicious and definitely the better of our two selections.  Thankfully, getting and paying for our check went much quicker than getting our food.   \n\nThe lifespan of casino restaurants, even the 24/7 places, is often quite brief.  Mr. Lucky's has been a veritable pillar within the Hard Rock since it opened in 1995, providing a constant and consistent dining experience throughout the casino's existence.  Prices have noticeably gone up over the years and service can be hit or miss, but I can't imagine this place changing much otherwise in its next 18 years.  Fine dining, it ain't, but Mr. Lucky's still provides decent value with its generous portions and relatively tasty fare."

I know......it is only $7.77, but it would look no better for FREE. Don't waste your time or your luck on this joint."

The shrimp was sweet and cooked to perfection.  I recomend adding sour cream to the mash and this will complete and excellent surf and turf meal for under 10 bucks."

The service is amazing all hours and they don't care if you come down in your swimsuit or all dressed  up straight from the club! Come by yourself or with a group of 15, the employees are attentive and wonderful no matter what! I LOVE MR. LUCKY'S!"

Dinner for 2 for about $25.  Also great about 4am for the I've-been- drinking -all -night -and-need-grease -special.  I am not sure how much this costs but I can tell you it's worth every penny to avoid the Absolut hangover."

They even did egg whites and apple sausage if you wanted to eat healthier.  (That would be Jenni from work, not me!)\nService was pretty friendly and the place seemed really clean.\nAte here twice, which is a good sign."

I also had the skillet which was mouth watering. My friend ordered the nachos they're huge and the cheese was spread evenly everywhere not just on the top like most restaurants do it. Also it's 24/7 so very convenient."

I don't really eat shrimp, so I gave this to my friend, but the steak was well-prepared, nothing amazing, but definitely good, and that's fine with me. Mashed potatoes were good.

We shared the Fire Roasted Nachos, and I have to say they were some of the best nachos I have had. We also ordered buffalo wings, I am pretty picky about wings, and these were good as well. Crispy veggie sticks, fun atmosphere.  Our waiter was very nice and in a good mood, very nice guy I wish i remembered his name. Iove a great attitude.\nBoth items 27 bucks. not bad for good after duh club food.\n\nI LOVE that its 24/7 and decent.I would suggest going after clubs/ bar hopping. I will be returning for late night snacks."

And on our family trip to celebrate my parent's 50th Wedding Anniversary, we tried to balance our budget between the pricey meals and the cheap ones to get more bang for our buck.\n\nThis is just a little diner with lots of other options, but depending on your budget or how you spend the rest of your money on your visit, it can be a great saver!\n\nThere is something called the Mr. Lucky's Special for $7.77 -  it's not on their menu.  So, we trekked there and I asked for it.  (You have to ask for it and they ask you the secret question of how much it costs before they will get it for you).  It's a small New York strip steak with shrimp and a side of veggies. You also get a side salad. It's a decent meal for a cheap price. \n\nFor late night, they also have a Graveyard Special $6.99 - steak, eggs, hash browns and toast. \n\nThe cooks do a good job cooking a cheap piece of steak and the eggs come out the way you ask for them. \n\nAnd in classic hard rock style, the people watching is fun.  :)"

The 777 is a must have! steak, shrimp, mashed potatoes and a salad for 7 dollas and 77 cents. Only down fall the wait... I don't understand how the wait was so long considering there were plenty of empty tables! The hostess was no help, as all we wanted was to sit down and order a mimosa or Irish coffee to cure the hangover but instead we had to wait in line until the servers were caught up. Mind you; I waited tables while in college and the crowd was managable, I think the waitress was just a rookie. Other then that if you are staying at the Hard Rock its a must try."

This was the only reputable spot open,  so we asked to get a table.  \n\nThough not even half of the tables were full,  The host let us know that the kitchen was backed up,  and his boss had told him not to seat anyone for 45 minutes.  Having worked in restaurants for years,  I understand that long ticket times lead to unhappy tables... While I've never seen anyone turn away tables,  I know this can be a rough spot for a restaurant,  especially if it's under staffed... \n\nWhile we were told we couldn't eat on spot because of the kitchen back-up,  we were told that we could place a to-go order which would be out in 25 minutes..  This made no sense since a kitchen backup should affect both dine in and carryout orders. Ticket times for both should be the same. \n\nGiven the circumstances,  we chose to re-evaluate our food choices,  7 minutes later,  with nowhere else to go,  we chose to return to place a carryout order. We returned and noticed the host seating other tables.... The host informed us that they were now able to seat tables. We were confused,  irritated and couldn't help but wonder had this been something personal or just a show of poor restaurant management. \n\nWe were sat,  ordered an omelet and a salad,  neither of which were great and our server wasn't particularly friendly. \n\nThe food was ok, and I have to say it's truly  nice to have a 24/7 place to eat... Unfortunately,  the service,  especially on the part of the host was despicable."
