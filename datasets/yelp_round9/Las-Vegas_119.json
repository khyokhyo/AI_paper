            "review": "I hate to write this because Krug Siam used to be our go to Thai place.  But...\n\nThe live entertainment is always way too loud, so much so that it takes away from the meal.  (At least on New Year's Eve he was on tune...)\n\nOur food order was messed up.  The Thai Spicy 8 was barely spicier than the no spicy.  And the one dish I specifically said no spicy (for my young son) was spicier than the two level two spicy dishes.  The waitress filled my son's Sprite with water.  The Cashew Nut was almost entirely celery and the Pad Thai was made with glass noodles...\n\nBut my bigger problem is that the food was just okay.  I used to drive across the valley to eat here but my neighborhood Thai places are much better.  \n\nSo they aren't bad.  If I'm on this side of town I may even stop in again, but with all the other choices of places to eat, I don't think so.  And I'm definitely not driving across town for them."

            "review": "This place was just ok. Not amazing, not aweful, but just ok. I came in for a quick lunch with my dad and the sign stated that the week of Christmas and New Years, they didn't have lunch specials, which was the main reason we came. Both of us were freaking starving, so we just decided to stay.\n\nWe pretty much got there right when they opened so service was good. They were pretty attentive and kept refilling our drinks. That's a good sign. Now on to the food.\n\nCrab rangoons\nThis is one of my favorite things to order for an appetizer. I was really disappointed. We were the first ones in the restaurant so I expected them to come out hot and fresh. Nope, these were just warm like they were  made 20 mins before and just sitting. When I opened one, you could see how greasy it was. \n\nChicken panang\nI enjoyed this dish a lot. Big chunks of chicken and chunks of bell peppers. It was really good, like what panang is supposed to taste like, but the portion was really small for the $10 price. I could have just eaten that myself. \n\nBeef larb\nI'm not a fan of their version. Instead of using chopped pieces of beef, they used ground beef. They use cabbage instead of lettuce like I'm used to at other places. To me this dish reminded me of another Filipino dish called papaitan (spelling?). For anyone who knows who that is, you know that distinct taste I'm talking about. Not really pleasant in Thai food. \n\nOverall, I had a decent experience here. I'd come here if someone else was paying, but I'll stick to other Thai places around town."

Seafood Delight - Spicy 3: 14.99\n4. 3 Steamed rice: 4.50 \n5. Garlic Pepper chicken: 9.99\n6. Red Curry Beef: 10.99\nfor $85.05 (automatic 18% tip charge AFTER tax) \n \n- Easy to spot, but hard to get to! Coming from the strip, off of Spring Mtn, and to this place, does everyone have to make an illegal u-turn off Valley View?! haha\n- Great looking bar and dine for a Thai restaurant, but bathrooms don't match!\n- Ambiance doesn't match service. \n- Lame and lazy service. On a slow evening, we have to hunt down Takky to tell her we're ready to order, get drink refills, remove empty plates, organize our own table. No ass kissers here. Fail.\n- Tom yum had great flavor, strong sour and spicy taste. hot! Loved it, but a bit expensive for tom yum. Too much cilantro.\n- Pad Thai chicken was delicious! Just how I want my Pad Thai to taste. \n- Seafood Delight was a dry and spicy. I couldn't imagine how it would taste if it were a 5! Yikes! Mussels are tiny but packed with flavor. Too much onions. \n- Garlic Pepper chicken packed a punch of garlic! A Vampire's nightmare. Good with the broccoli. \n- Red Curry beef was pretty good, but I should have just gotten the Panang. Ugh..\n- Automatic gratuity = 6 or more in party.\n- SNEAKS! Charging tip after tax."

I called to inform them about the problem but didn't have time to go back to the restaurant. Very disappointing when you pay $15.12 and don't get what you ordered at all. They never offered me a credit for next time while I called. They didn't apologize either- just let me know they would pass on the message to the kitchen. \n\nThe curry also taste very watered down and thin. It taste like they used half coconut milk half water. Absolutely disgusting."

The last time we came to Chinatown, we chose a different Thai place, and decided to come back and knock Krung Siam off the list.  Very glad we did.  It was packed but we were seated promptly.  I didn't see my favorite dish (Pad Prik King) on the menu, so I asked them if they had it.  They did!  It hadn't made it to the menu yet, but it was available for order.  So glad I asked.  \n\nFood, service, atmosphere, wine list, all 4 stars.  I'm very happy we finally checked this place out, especially given there are a couple other Thai restaurants in town that we already love to frequent.  Now, Krung Siam is in the rotation."

            "review": "admittedly, i am a hell of a tough critic when it comes to thai food.  the same can be said about a few different cuisines, but with thai food specifically, i critique not just on taste, but on their ability to listen to my needs.  i am allergic to coconut, AND i can only handle a moderate amount of spicy stuff (unless i'm just in a spicy food kind of mood).  when visiting a thai restaurant, if the server does not appear to be listening to my two requirements, i am instantly leery and play it safe with pad thai or something common like that.\n\nwith all that said, OMFG, this place was SO goooooood!  i had been working reeeeally hard on sunday night and after a hellacious day and night of work, i happened upon this place with a friend and a coworker.  i say happened upon it because i am not from Las Vegas, and was only in town for work from LA.  my coworker is a total food.  my friend is a persnickety eater.  we were all overjoyed and satisfied with our food.\n\nmy coworker (the fellow foodie) had a spicy shrimp thing, which i believe was a sort of curry, but my hunger prevented me from paying closer attention to his order.  my friend (the picky eater) had a chicken in yellow curry.  i had the dish that was accurately named Seafood Delight.  delighted indeed i was!  first of all, i asked the waiter to have it made only slightly spicy.  they couldn't have possibly gotten the spice level more perfect!  it was amazing.  the aforementioned delights included:  shrimp, fishballs, scallops, mussels, and a myriad of appropriately matched veggies.  it was fantastic.  \n\nfor a second i wondered if my hunger and tiredness contributed to how positively i received this meal, but no, this place stood as an excellent thai spot regardless of my pitiful state.  it bums me out that such an awesome thai place isn't actually found in LA.  i mean, some of the spots in thai town in hollywood are great, but this place is head and shoulders above it.  i'm not sure when i'll be back in Vegas, but whenever that is, i certainly hope to return here.  my foodie coworker concurred with this sentiment.  emphatically, five stars!"

Nice place to eat, friend service, and your water cup stays full, perfect for when you're hungover from a night of partying too hard. This isn't watered down Thai food, so when it says spicy, it's going to be pretty spicy. Great food, great service, great decor, and a great 4 star Thai restaurant."

            "review": "The food here was all great.  The flavors were excellent.  Everything was served fairly quickly once we were able to order.  \nAnd that is where they lose a star. \nWe were a party of two and the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived.  We were seated in one of their tall backed booths near the stage they had setup for a guitar/vocalist (pretty decent).  There was a party of 12 in the middle of service and three other tables of three-four customers.  \nWe waited at least 10 minutes after being seated as we saw three different servers working with the other tables.  I finally leaned out of the booth and waved to the manager.  He came to the table and became our server.  He even put on the black apron.  He was dressed in business attire while the servers all had their uniform on.  \n\nSo the food was great.  We had the pork jerky that you dip in this great chili spiced dressing.  Chicken Larb (hot level 3) which was super tasty of citrus and heat and onions.  A really great pad thai with chicken.  There was a lot of flavor in this.  Some pad thai dishes are kind of bland.  Not this one.  Great green curry...sweet and spicy and creamy.  Again it was rich and flavorful.  The beef itself was pretty ick though.  It was overcooked.\n\nTwo for one SingHa beers made up for some of what was lacking.  \nLet's hope that no one else has as much trouble getting a server's attention, though."

(this didn't upset me), however she came back  with a wet.mop reeking of the fabuloso. . it was so strong that were gagging, luckily we were done eating or we would have lost it.\n3. the spice tray was even offered to us, however saw them deliver to other tables.\n\nFood\n1.  Chicken panang - I asked for 8/10 spiciness. it was probably an 5 on my scale. a plus though is the lychee in it\n2. chicken satay - good per my son's standard (he's a junior foodie)\n\n3. combination pad Thai - we had better, kids said it tasted weird.\n\n4. peanut sauce with chicken satay- good and warm\n\nso.overall a comedy of errors.\n\nwill I come back? maybe not, Vegas has a lot to offer  and may only come back if my boys truly. crave the crying tiger."

I can't understand how people are raving about this place so much. There are several really good Thai restaurants and this just isn't one of them. I ate here last night and didn't care for it and felt bad that I had to pay for something that I only took a few bites of and hated.  Of course, the server saw that my food was virtually untouched and no one is going to offer to take it off the bill. I recommend a different place for Thai."

This is not good especially for a restaurant in Chinatown.  To me, that generally means the food is not authentic, that it is watered down for the American palette.  Coincidentally, My friend is white & she believes there is some truth to that.  \nWe ordered the Chicken Larb salad, Garlic and pepper chicken & the drunken noodle, all medium spicy.  The food was okay.  Of the 3 dishes, only the drunken noodle packed a punch in the spicy dept.  The other 2 were barely hot.  The Lard salad & garlic pepper chicken were unremarkable & sort of bland.  \nThe decor was very pleasant.  The servers were very nice, all smiles & stuff.  Excellent customer service was delivered to us.  Our server came over to check on us about 5 times, asking how we liked the food & if she could get us anything else.  We thought this level of customer service would not be found in your average restaurant in Chinatown where the primary clientele was Asians.  There, it is sit down, eat your food and get out lol"

Wasnt really crowded and it looks as if karaoke was on the agenda for the night.\n\nThe menu is a bit limited, at least in my opinion, for a thai restaurant. The pricing and limited menu didnt look like it would play well with conventional asian family style communitive dinner.\n\nThe beef salad was by far the best tasting item we ordered during this meal. It was nicely seasoned and grilled to order so it had that fresh off the grill smokey, concentrated, burnt taste. \n\nKrung Siam platter is...quite...insulting to be honest. 13 hard earned dollars for two of everything: \n\nTwo satays one chicken one beef both lacking the fresh off the grill smokey flavor, seems more like broiled, chicken was overly dry. Sauces were there obviously to cover up this fact.\n\nSpring rolls: more like miniature egg rolls with bland tasteless filling. Another excuse to show off the sauces or serve something deep fried, or both.\n\nFried Battered Shrimp: tasteless with more deep fried flavor then shrimp flavor. Might as well deep fry presoaked and reshapened cardboard if you have a deep fry fetish be a lot cheaper too\n\nThai Dumplings: Best thing on the plate but seriously not thai. Not even close unless Dim Sum started in Thailand and the Chinese came, knocked out the Thai, stole their food and the Thai woke up and completely forgot about it.\n\nCrab Ragoons: Again i have a problem with this. Crab implies fresh crab, a little guy with two pinchers, a bunch of claws and sweet sweet meat. Krab is a biproduct of liquefied, reshapened, reseasoned and food colored crap (yes crap not krap). Anyway no surprise here it had a heavily deep fried taste, very little texture from the Krab, lots and lots of cream cheese. Here's an idea why not just bread and deep fry cream cheese?\n\nOkay enough of that lets move on to the main courses:\nPanang Curry\nQuite nice. Ordered mild and everything was nice, flavorful, and mellow until i started fishing pieces off the bottom. Diced up chilis were waiting for me leaving my mouth burning and attempting to chill the flames with the coconut/peanut sauce from the sampler.\n\nBeef Fried Rice\nYeah we can call epic fail on this one. Your basic very very dry not seasoned very well, wth is wrong with this beef it's colorless and tasteless fried rice.\n\nThe last complaint is the insulting price to food ratio. the sampler was 13.99 with only 7.99 worth of food. Both the rice and the curry were a decent size for one person but not filling.\n\nOverall i can only give this place three stars. It's just too much money for too little food. This would be a place to take a date but not a place for serious eating"

            "review": "A friend took us out here and it is truly some of the BEST thai food i've ever had. Every dish was so flavorful and authentic tasting. Now, i'm not thai, but you could really taste the complex flavors and cooking style were not watered down for americanized taste buds.\n\nI ordered the Thai Basil with steamed tofu and the sauce was just to die for! perfect balance of sweet, salty, basil flavor. The eggplant basil dish was also mind blowing. The eggplant was slightly caramelized and meaty. The drunken noodles had soft, succulent noodles. the Pad thai was so different from the overly-peanutted(is that a word?) dishes I've had elsewhere. Lots of great flavor & texture everywhere. \nWe also orderd a pot of tom yum soup for the table which was fantastic. However, please be warned, those are not green beans in there! it was a 5 alarm fire in my mouth for a minute when i took a bite into one of those chiles!\n\nThe prices are great - $4.99 lunch specials during the week and $8-$15 entrees otherwise. Everything was out of this world delicious. Don't miss this place if you are in Vegas and have a hankering for Thai food! I wish I had a place like this near home.\n\noh, also, it's in the Chinatown area off the strip so you can also go get foot massages at sketchy places across the street. ;-)"

I scoped the place out looking for my friends. after a few rounds of head turning, I saw my friend waving me down into this separate room.\n\nThis place looks pretty upscale due to the decor, however, the service is a far cry from being upscale. We constantly had to flag down a waitstaff (Even though the place seemed pretty empty) since they were just standing around doing nothing.\n\nWhen we asked for something, they looked irritated as to not wanting to be bothered or that they weren't our waiter/waitress. It's just BULL!!! If their waitstaff were attentive, we wouldn't have to flag someone down to get some service. \n\nSo to the food. It was mediocre at best. The yellow and green curry were bleh. It was more like a soup. The pad thai wasn't as flavorful as I had wanted it to be. It was more on the bland side of the spectrum. The only dish that blew my mind was the Jun Pad Poo. The crab meat was fresh and big chunks at that.\n\nThis was the really bummer here. When you are done eating, you're setting yourself up for a dessert that you expect that a Thai Restaurant should have. SERIOUSLY! NO MANGO WITH STICKY RICE? wait wait . . . NO FRIED BANANA WITH ICE CREAM? WTFH!!! The server's response was \" We don't have mango with sticky rice. Oh we don't have fried banana with ice cream either. It's not in season right now so we don't have it.\" Everyone at our table thought . . . \"ARE YOU F-ing SERIOUS?\" So we decided to go even further and asked \"So what do you have?\" The response was, \"Oh we have just plain ice cream and roti\". To our disappointment, we just asked for the check so we can leave. \n\nOverall, since they had a cheap lunch special. It was a cheap bargain. I'll be a little on the positive side and give them a 2 star. 1 got the nice decor of the place. 2 for the cheap lunch deal.\n\nMy advice is to test this place out during the lunch hour so you don't get charged more for something that you would've gotten for less. Who is to say, right? They might have something super good that will blow your mind, but so far for me, nothing stood out for me."

This time was no exception. They are able to hit all the tasty sweet, sour, spicy notes Thai food is typically using a mix of spices, seasoning, and mints. Their portions of protein and carbohydrates are well balanced as well. I never feel like I'm left at the end with too much meat and no noodle or vice versa. \n\nI did order my food too spicy this time and was unable to finish my food, but I feel that was my fault more than their. I wish there was a more consistent way for people to order their food spiciness across all restaurant or at least Thai restaurant. I ordered a 7 and could not finish my food because each bite felt like eating fire, so watch the spiciness!"

But for your classic American Thai favorites as a lunch special, this is a really good value. \n\nThe Panang Curry with Chicken is a good lunch portion, but the curry is thin. My wife enjoyed the noodle dishes, and feels the same way about the quality. Not impressive, but acceptable for a lunch, served in a relaxing atmosphere. \n\nLunches are fair portions, and served with soup before the main course. \n\nService is prompt and friendly. You actually get the same server throughout, and they check back on a regular basis. Very refreshing in a Thai place. \n\nBest deal......Thai Iced Teas and Coffees are just $1 during lunch. \n\nLocation is good with easy parking. \n\nFor the cost of a trip to Quizino's or a mediocre burger joint, you can enjoy a somewhat healthy lunch at a great price."

We were then ignored for 20 minutes so we walked out and came here. I am SO glad we did! Everything about this place is great! Atmosphere, staff, food, entertainment, presentation were fantastic. Our server, Sam, was great. Very informative and friendly. He asked me how spicy I wanted my food on a scale of 1-10 and I'm glad I said 3. It was the perfect spice that it wasn't so overpowering that I couldn't taste all the other flavors. Neither of us had an empty glass on the table, and my husband had at least 4 refills. He never had to ask for one. We are definitely going back and recommending them to everyone we know."

Overall I wasn't overly impressed, but I could see bringing friends or a date to this place.  \n\nThe Crab Rangoon was very sweet.  The sauce reminded me of pomegranate jelly. Not bad, but definitely not the best.  Way too sweet in my book.  The Thai tea was alright, but it tasted a little cheap or perhaps with artificial sweeteners.\n\nThe duck curry (red curry) was the best part of the meal.  It was actually quite tasty.  This dish had a surprising mixture of green and red peppers, tiny chopped carrots, peas, fresh pineapple chunks, and raisins.  The red curry itself was satisfactory in taste, and had a watery texture that soaked well into the white rice.  It was served with the perfect level of spice (I asked for medium), and it was not too sweet.  Not a bad dish at all.\n\nI didn't have any problems with the service, which I've noticed in a few reviews.  The place was mostly staffed by younger Asians, and they were having a good time while working, so maybe there are nights when the staff get carried away... I dunno.  The atmosphere was very classy though, with jazz music in the background.  I probably won't go back on my own again, but like I said earlier, this would be a nice place to take a date."

Much like many Asian restaurants, their lunch specials are ridiculously affordable (I believe $5.99 for a small soup and entree). Unfortunately, the service is akin to most of its Asian brethren as well. Which is to say, it is very hit, miss, or indifferent. Krung steps up the decor more than most plain jane Asian joints, which is a welcoming edition. Overall, if you want a satisfying Thai experience that is easy on the wallet (especially during lunch), give Krung Siam a whirl. And tell them Judas sent you! (That will probably give you the same indifferent response than if you told them, \"Never fake the funk on a nasty dunk.\")"

It's very nice inside, very polished, nicely decor and the tables and both weren't all crammed in together. They also have a bar and plenty of flat screen TVs all around the room. We (my fiance and I) decided to order their Pad Thai. I believe it was like 10.99 and you get to pick your choice of meat. For $3 more you can have shrimp and you get 3 or 4 pieces of shrimp. If you wanted to add seafood combination that's also another $3. I wasn't happy with the Pad Thai because it was way too soggy and sweet. Service was okay. The waitress quickly came around and asked is everything alright after we got our food. We waited a good 10 minutes before I got frustrated and told my guy to flag down our waitress for our bill. The waitress said something my guy didn't understand. Minutes later I was able to get one of the other waitress attention and she went to give get us our bill. If I saw a designated station where you can pay after waiting 10 plus minutes I would have already pay my bill and went on my happy way. This is the first restaurant I've ever been to that you just don't know where you can take your bill. This restaurant is not very organized. There were more than 4 employees standing around behind the bar talking and just 2 waitress on the floor and it was almost a full house. The price is pretty high but you're paying for the entertainment. This restaurant does not have the best location. It's located in China Town. The parking is alright. If it had not been for the entertainment I would give this restaurant 1 star."

We had both been craving Thai food, and because we were without a computer, we had to choose a place the old fashioned way, that is, we looked to see which restaurant had the most cars outside of it. Its hard to tell in China Town because it is just strip mall after strip mall, but there seemed to be many cars in front of Krung Siam and people going inside. \nWhen we got in, we were pleasantly surprised. The decor was very modern, and I felt like we were in an upscale Asian restaurant in Chicago or New York. Additionally, from the looks of the lights and the sound set up on the inside, this place gets hopping after dark. \n\nWe were greeted by a very young looking hostess, and actually all the staff we saw were quite young, which was just not what we are used to in this part of town. On to the food! I got the Pad See Uw with Tofu and the wife got pineapple fried rice. We also both got Thai Iced Tea. The tea was not as sweet as I've had other places, which was very nice. The spices were more prominent, and the flavor was bold, but not overpowering. My dish was amazing. I think its probably the best tofu I've had in a while. It w as fried, but not over fried and the black soy sauce filled the pores of the tofu. It was nice and firm, but not too crunchy. The noodles were also cooked perfectly. I could have eaten them by themselves. The veggies were also cooked well, not too stiff and not soggy. The wife's lunch was also very good. All the veggies and fruit was very fresh, and including raw cashews and unsweetened raisins really completed the meal. It was flavorful but not too sweet and not too salty. \n\nThe price was very reasonable. Less than at our other Thai haunts. We paid about $22 for the 2 entrees and 2 Thai teas. Not bad at all. \n\nIf I could give Krung Siam a 3.5 I would, but I will round up to a 4. I am excited to come back to this place."

Dim lights with party lights, a fog machine and a DJ. The bass was really pumping through your bodies... good or bad depending how you're feeling. We were promptly seated and ordered drinks and received them almost immediately, along with our plates and utensils.\n\nThe decor of the place was really nice, actually. It was very modern for a Thai place. But besides from that, you might have to wait a long time for your dishes to come out during the late night hours. Luckily I have a patient boyfriend, so we managed to get our food. I saw another couple walk out though because they couldn't wait any longer. I don't blame them.\n\nWe waited probably about 30-45 minutes for our food, and our entrees came before our appetizer! We found this odd, but we were hungry so we just ate.\n- Beef Satay: This came in the middle of our entrees, but this dish in particular was worth the wait. Beautifully presented, tender with a delicious peanut sauce. My boyfriend took the cucumber to cool his mouth down when he was eating his curry ;)\n- Pad Thai: It started out good, with the right amount of meat ratio with tofu thrown in. However, at some point near the end (bottom of the plate) it started to taste spoiled?! I don't know how, but it did and I couldn't finish the rest of it.\n- Yellow Curry (Spice Level 10): My boyfriend asked for this, and don't try this if you do not have a high spice tolerant. My boyfriend wanted to be challenged, and he was sweating profusely and his face was all red. He was clinging onto his Thai Iced Tea and water like it was his best friend. But other than that, he thought it was good.\nCheck was about $30 for the 3 dishes and 2 drinks during Happy hour. Good deal!\n\nOverall: Dishes are kind of hit-and-miss and service is a little bit spotty. If you come during the late night hours, expect a night club atmosphere with long wait times."

Last but not least, the only reason I kept ordering from here is because I crave fried bananas and everywhere else makes them hard on the outside (like egg rolls) while I like them to be fluffy. This is the only place I've found that makes them fluffy! The first time they tasted great, second time they tasted like rotten bananas were used, third time they were okay, and the last time not only did the bananas taste super nasty but the bread on the outside (or whatever it is) didn't even cover up the banana all the way.

Let's start by saying it was around 11:30 pm and the atmosphere was pretty cool.  It's a nice dining room with a nice feel (and open late!).  It was a Monday night (we had gone in search of Fuku, forgetting it was closed on Mondays), and Karaoke was happening.  So everything started out positively.  Our server was nice enough, but it was very inattentive service.  After a while, we ordered 3 dishes: Tom Yum Goon, Chicken Satay, and Rad Nar with chicken.\n\nWe ordered the Tom Yum \"Medium\" when he asked us how spicy.  We actually like spicy food, but weren't in the mood to really test our limits.  The \"medium\" was the spiciest Tom Yum we'd ever had (fine for me though it definitely had my nose running and gulping on my water), but my girlfriend couldn't hang and was disappointed.  Medium should have a good strong kick, and we wouldn't have minded if it was just Hot labeled medium, but this was REALLY hot.  Plus, the water was not getting refilled.  Our waiter disappeared completely during this time; eventually we were done with the soup and completely dry keeping our eyes peeled for him.  He must have been on break, because he eventually showed up with our Chicken Sate, room temperature.  Again, not completely a deal breaker-- It actually tasted pretty good and we are pretty used to Thai delivery/takeout where that's fairly par for the course.  However, one of the best things about actually going out for Thai food is that the Chicken Sate can be served absolutely piping hot.  In this case it was double fail, because not only was it room temperature, we suffered from not getting our water refilled that entire time.  Which brings me to the Rad Nar (flat noodles in gravy).  Again, I don't want to sound like a complainer, but when we order a noodle dish we want noodles.  It was strange, there was a very generous helping of the expensive ingredients beef and Chinese broccoli which I appreciate (for those of you paying attention to what we ordered and what we got, congratulations--again we like beef just fine, but come on, we ordered chicken, and when I mentioned we ordered chicken, the server just smiled and shrugged until my girlfriend said it was OK, we'd take the beef), but it was very skimpy on the noodles.  It made it a hard dish to share as we got like 3 flat noodles each.\n\nSo the meal itself was completely botched; that said, it was still pretty decent for late night Thai.  We won't be back if we find someplace better that's open at the hour, but the food itself was pretty decent/good-- even after getting everything completely wrong.  \n\nOh and the epilogue; when we got the check the Tom Yum was marked 4-Star heat.  So that explained that.  I don't know how medium translated to that, but oh well."

My friend got this pork belly dish sauteed in some Chinese broccoli.\n\nThe Thai BBQ chicken comes on a sizzling plate.  The server then adds some liquid to the plate and the plate flames up.  It's a pretty cool sight to see.  And my chicken was piping hot throughout my entire meal, which is always good.  Cold chicken isn't always the tastiest, right?\n\nThe Panang Curry with chicken at Level 7 spice was really good.  Spicy food after some drinks hits the spot.  Level 7 can be a bit too spicy for others, but it was bearable.  Would definitely get this.\n\nThe Sauteed Pork Belly with Chinese Broccoli was so good.  The pork belly was crispy and flavorful.  The sauce it was in was just right and didn't make the pork belly all soggy.\n\nFor some reason, it's dark in here.  One could definitely have trouble eating in the dark.  Okay, not really, but it is pretty dark in here.  There's also karaoke.  And a full bar.  Another table even ordered a whole bottle of liquor to go with their food.  Better than the thousands people drop for a bottle at the clubs in Vegas, right?  Ha.\n\nGood place for some food for sure."

This was one of the first restaurants my boyfriend and I tried when we moved to Las Vegas in 2011, and let me tell you it did not disappoint! \n\nWhen we arrived (with a party of 7) for his 24th birthday, we were greeted and seated almost immediately. Earlier in the day I came by to drop off a birthday cake and some decorations and they waitress had them set up when our party arrived.\n\nFirst thing ordered was Thai Ice Teas for the table. Which were amazing. Not too sweet, and not too strong, just perfect.\n\nFor appetizers we order 3 servings of the Thai beef Jerky. Very tender with just the right amount of spice.\n\nMy dinner selection was the shaved papaya salad (I ordered a 4 in spiciness) and it was crazy hot, but I washed it down with the tea ( the next time we visited I ordered a 3 and it was perfect).\n\nThe waitress brought a round of martinis to the table to commemorate the birthday celebration, and the person doing karaoke at the time joined us in singing happy birthday. It was an awesome night.\n\nPros:\n\natmosphere\nservice\nfood\n\ncons:\nParking\nlighting (it was a little on the dark side)\n\nThis review is from my first visit in 2012 and we have been back 8 times since. Definitely recommend!"

My friends and I love Thai food, and Krung Siam offers some of the best in LV Chinatown. I am a huge fan of their Pad Thai, which is a perfect balance of spice, peanuts, and flavorful noodles. I have also tried, and enjoyed, both their Pad See Ew and Boat Noodle Soup. The soup is particularly good when I'm feeling under the weather.\n\nMy problem really comes down to the service. I guess it seems like they don't care. I ordered Pad See Ew with beef once, and it came out with chicken. I told them that it was fine since I'm not one to make a fuss, but like most people, I expect to get what I order. Whenever we come here, I just feel as if our table is getting ignored. I have to look around before anyone comes to check up on us. We usually come late night when it isn't super busy, too. They do have a karaoke stage, which is apparently pretty popular. I don't care too much for hearing random people sing in Thai, but that's probably just me. You should definitely still come for the food, and maybe you will have a better experience with the service."

My father ordered the Thai BBQ which came out fajita style  the bottom of the Cornish hen was slightly burnt due to the hot iron but the flavor was still excellent.

Day One: Tom Yum Noodle Soup\nI ordered this dish with flat rice noodles and it definitely hit the spot after a crazy night of drinking. The soup tasted super authentic and was not too tart.  As for the meat and fishballs, there was plenty of that so no need to worry about the portions here! \n\n2. Day Two: Spicy Basil Fried Rice \nI had a taste of my friend's order the day before and I was hooked instantly. The rice had a strong garlicky taste so this is a great dish for a garlic lover. The beef that came with this dish actually surprisingly tender and not chewy at all.\n\nFinal Verdict: \nThumbs up."

Not sure what kind of soup it was. Now onto the entrees. \n\n-Pad Thai (chicken) : Wasn't much flavor to it at all, just overly sweet. Chicken was ok. \n-Red Curry (chicken): Not spicy at all. Wasn't that good. Didnt even if finish it. \n-Drunken Noodles (beef): Not spicy at all. The description made it sound like it was spicy and sounded like pad kee mao. This wasn't very flavor either. Just oily noodles and some garnishes. \n\nNow the service. We were in here close to an hour and the server came by once to check up on us and refill our drinks.

(Also, my husband's review will be three stars, so together it works out. Yelp math!)\n\nWe hit Krung last night after doing an \"Open Now\" search on Yelp at 2 a.m.. After eliminating all of the usual casino coffeeshops (with their limited late-night menus) and deciding against a drive to Jean to try the all-night buffet (summer break = Teachers Eating Wild!),Krung it was.\n\n\"Wait, didn't this building used to be Satay?\" My husband had been bugging me to go to Satay ever since trying their chicken sticks at the International Food Fair. (Translation: 2007.) Well, look honey, you finally got your wish.\n\nI was rubbing my hands in anticipation because my love affair with Marnee Thai, also in \"Chinatown\" and also open in the very wee hours, was cut short on the second visit when we found the menu, ownership, and seemingly the chef had all changed. Noooo! We were supposed to be the Brangelina of late-night Thai. Shari + Marnee =... Sharnee! A portmanteau for the foodie ages! But now I had a second chance at finding late-night Thai love. (Shari + Krung =... Shrung? Hm.)\n\nRight away I was struck by the pleasant, spacious decor. (Space is a big deal with me. It's an only-child thing.) We were seated in a long, cushy booth by the little stage where bouncy remixes were blasting. A customer soon came over to turn it up even louder. Eeek. The cushions in the booth were shaking like we were playing the Top Gun slot and just got the bonus game. Then a waiter hurried back to turn it down; we gave him an appreciative nod. Then he came back to turn it up again, asking us if it was okay. Awkward. At this point we were the only people sitting by the stage, and the few other patrons across the room didn't appear to be the partying type. We shrugged it off as Krung's \"thing\" and got used to it. If the restaurant had been busier, though, the overall noise may have been too much.\n\nSeveral reviews of Krung complain about the promptness of the service. Our two servers were polite and swift with refills. Absolutely no problems there.\n\nWe ordered large. We're never too proud to get to-go boxes for tomorrow's lunch. Fried tofu, chicken satay sticks, fresh (not fried, although that's available) spring rolls, pad thai with tofu, and basil with chicken. Although I'm disappointed every time I go to a Thai restaurant and they don't have summer rolls like Panna Thai does, the menu was nicely varied and much on par with Archi's in that regard.\n\nFried Tofu: The best I've had in Las Vegas. Definitely crispy, pieces not so large that the center is gooey, and I really liked the usual sourish sauce with a heavy layer of peanuts on top. \n\nChicken Satay Sticks: And these were, according to my husband, the worst in Las Vegas. Ever. Bland. Kind of cold. \"Tasted like they'd been microwaved, and not very well.\" The satay sauce was not unlike unsalted peanut butter.\n\nFresh Spring Rolls: Huge! Imagine a double-fistful of salad wrapped in lettuce, and the salad is deliciously aromatic with a spicy crunch. Fun to try, but hard to eat, and we definitely didn't need four of these giant things. (Came with the same satay sauce in quasi-shot glasses with peanuts on top. We eventually started dipping them in the bowl of sauce that came with the fried tofu instead - much easier to manage.)\n\nBasil: I'll let my husband review that one on his own, but he liked it.\n\nPad Thai with Tofu: I know, not very adventurous, but I just love pad thai. The tofu seemed to be fried first then cut up, making for some unfried sides, which is not how I prefer it, but it was still good, especially since the tofu pieces were small. \n\nI asked for the heat to be \"7, maybe 6-7,\" and I feel they nailed that perfectly. That said, on a few occasions I crunched into a tiny pepper-pocket that must've still had seeds, as my tongue nearly blistered right off. I don't seem to get that problem elsewhere.\n\nOverall, the flavours mixed well to suffuse the entire dish, and I can honestly say this is the only pad thai I've had in a long time where I didn't seek out all of the tofu bits to eat first.\n\nAs good as the service was, we did have a timing problem after all. Our two main dishes came out within a few minutes of our appetizers, so we had almost no time to linger and enjoy the \"courses.\" Instead it was like a tableside buffet. Luckily we'd realized at this point that we'd prefer a quick meal, but if it had been a more normal hour and we'd not been on the tired side, this would've been disappointing.\n\nOverall, Krung is a place I will delight in visiting after-hours, but when the sun is up, it's still going to be Panna Thai, Archi's, and maybe Pin Kaow II for me."

It was $30 incuding the $2 delivery fee and left my belly nice and full with enough grease to soak up the liquor. \nThe wings were a little on the sweet side for my liking but the rest of the food was particulary tasty and HOT (temperature and spice - but bc I asked for it to be)"

Lots of customers come there to have drinks after work and order Thai food. It's very poorly lit and it's not a place where you can have a conversation while eating your food because the waiters and waitresses keep coming back and forth asking if everything's okay. They did that to me for a total of 28 times. It was insane! I've never been asked that sooo many times in my life during a visit to a restaurant. Okay enough about my experience and on to the food.\n\nI ordered boat noodles which is a favorite for me at other Thai spots.. I told them no tendon and what do I see when I first get my bowl of soup? TENDON.. No Bueno! So I don't say anything because I always think to myself that they can do something to my food if I complain so I take the tendon out myself like champ. Then the broth was just overpowering and salty. Unfortunately I have a bad experience here and won't be coming back ever."

Alright, maybe the servers were not as homey or warm as I would've expected them to be - but I will give them the benefit of the doubt and take it that I do get groggy myself at that time of day (2pm). Nonetheless, they got our orders down like lightning and our food arrived in less than 10 minutes.\n\nPapa had the sweet and sour shrimp, mommy had garlic and pepper chicken and I got the yellow curry beef. I must've been the most satisfied out of the three of us. Curry was extra mild, as requested and the coconut milk brought out a rich overall flavor to the dish. I'd say it was sweet with a touch of spiciness - not eye-watering hot, but enough to keep the spoonfuls coming in.\n\nMommy liked her chicken. Didn't last too long. Papa wasn't too keen on his order because he said that it tasted like pre-cooked, pre-packaged and refrigerated shrimp tossed into a plate of sweet and sour sauce. To put it simply, I guess he meant that the flavor did not soak in too well. \n\nOh and how could I forget? We absolutely loved the soup! (it came with the lunch specials) Would've liked it too if there were side servings of egg roll and fried wonton for every order like the krung siam website said. Salmon was crossed out the menu for some reason (that was going to be my first option) so it's best to not rely on their site to be in the know how about what they currently have. \n\nWe'll be back here again for lunch soon. Enjoyed the peaceful ambiance and papa had a great time keeping score of the NBA playoffs thanks to the tellies lined up along the walls. They each had a different sport playing. At some point, he needed to know a team's score so I sifted through my phone to check it and hola, there was wi-fi! Could've been jacked from the starbucks right beside (very very possible) but still, you get to access it and that's the best part."

The decor is actually cute and the restaurant is very spacious on the inside -- much different than most of the very compact restaurants on Spring Mountain. Our server was a bit rigid at first, but with time became a lot more relaxed and very friendly and attentive. The lunch deal was great.. $5.99 for soup of the day which was delicious Tom Kha on that particular day and one of many entree options. I of course opted for Drunken Noodles with chicken. They were great! The chicken was cooked perfectly and not too dry which is my main contention with most Thai places when it comes to their chicken dishes. I opted for heat level 6 on a scale 1-10. It had the perfect amount of heat..and I like spicy. So be cautious..if you don't do spicy regularly go for a 4-5 tops. Otherwise, 6-7 are ideal. This was a perfect lunch and you really can't beat the price for the quality and quantity of food."

We ordered seafood tom yum soup, crab fried rice, chicken larb, green curry, and shrimp salad. We requested that the tom yum soup, chicken larb, and shrimp salad all be \"mild.\" I'm pretty sure that translates roughly to \"slightly spicy.\" None of our dishes were spicy in the least bit. We couldn't even find chili flakes or remnants. Our tom yum soup was sweet rather than spicy, the crab fried rice tasted plain and flavorless, and the chicken larb was shockingly sour. We had to ask them to take it back to make it less sour and give it some type of spicy flavoring. Chicken larb (version 2.0) tasted exactly the same. Are they taste-blind or something?! As for the last 2 dishes, the green curry was nothing special and the shrimp salad...well, let's just say we played rock paper scissors, and the loser had to finish the shrimp salad (we didn't want to waste it).\n\nI feel slightly bad for giving their food such a terrible review because the service was great. They were very receptive to our complaints about the chicken larb. Unfortunately, the chef just couldn't deliver. Oh yeah, and they forgot about the chicken larb until we mentioned it. The other dishes had come out and we were almost full until we realized we hadn't received our chicken larb yet. We reminded the waiter, who said it would take just 2 more minutes...15 minutes later, he comes out with it. Proof that they forgot and started cooking it shortly after we reminded them.\n\nA couple of other notes: There's a small stage inside the restaurant, and apparently they have live music every night starting at 8 or 9 pm until 2 am. The inside decor was nice and clean...restroom was a horror show though."

The friendly service made me come back to be quite honest because the food is good and they way they treat you is spot on. After I found a worm in my food, they kindly offered to re-make the food for me or take it off the check. But which made me happier was that they offered to pay for my next dish free which was nice. The Rad Na was good but I think the meat was undercooked, that's why I got food poisoning.. in the end I will and forever will come back to this place it deserve a 3rd chance.

As soon as he told us the crab fried rice was good, we both glared at him and give him the \"oh come on, do you want to just show us where the nearest panda express is?\"  So after he embarrassingly apologized, and my friend started to speak Thai, he recommended something, and that was when my friend got very excited, which got me excited (although I really have no clue why).  My friend said they got some kind of squid with spicy dipping sauce, and it's really good.  So we put in the order, along with some kind of specialty beef noodle soup and an order of mixed vegetable.  In all honesty, my friend put in the order, and I was just going along for the ride!  I am the Thai food apprentice =)\n\nWhen the squid was served, my jaw almost dropped! And the reason was, on the plate were two giant grilled squid.  And why my jaw dropped? Because this is the first place I've ever been to that served grilled squid like the way you find it from street carts in Asia!  The squid were grilled to perfection, slices into rings, tentacles and all!  The dipping sauce was good, and the only way I can describe it is a thick kind of spicy fish sauce. YummmmOOOOO!\n\nThe beef noodle was excellent too (after my friend mod it to the spiciness of our preference).  Its a none creamy sweet and spicy dark broth with green veggies, beef meat balls, beef tendons and steaks, and bean thread noodles.  The bowl is huuuuge, enough to serve 2 to 3.\n\nThe most mediocre thing we ordered was the stir-friend mix veggies.  Its just your everyday stir-fried mix veggies with chili peppers.  But we gotta get those veggies in somehow =)  The order was kinda small comparing to the other dishes.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered Roti (Indian pancake) with condensed milk drizzled all over.  You can never go wrong with that! We also got the fried bananas.  We were expecting it to be egg-roll wrapped then fried.  Instead, its thickly battered and fried.  The batter also had shredded coconut in it, the aroma was nice, and the taste was good, but overall just taste like banana in a giant donut hole.  If you're not into fried food, like we weren't, don't order it.\n\nAll in all, we'll definitely come back again, especially for that grilled squid!! \n\nWe heart Krung Siam!"

WTH, really its 11:45am and you ran out of the noodles for your most popular dish?  So then I proceed to order a beef salad, and it was the saltiest dish they could have made!. Everything was drench in salt, even my tomatoes were salty!  My friend ordered pineapple fried rice and it was wet and clumpy.   My  boyfriend ordered  a bowl of tomyum soup, and that was the only dish that tasted great. Maybe they have a different chef that works during lunch hour and one at night.  When I came to Krung Siam in the past, it had always been at night, where the food tasted out of this world and the live music created such a nice ambiance."

During the entire service, Shaun T's new workout DVD was playing. Can this guy get any more greedy?! \n\nService:\nVery nice and pleasant. The server I think didn't quite understand what vegan meant or maybe the kitchen just heard \"vegetarian\" and assumed no meat but egg is fine. Though I did request no fish or oyster sauce and no egg, the dish came out with egg. \n\nFood: \nI ordered the papaya salad with no fish sauce. It was really good. I love spicy, and after reading a review before dining about how spicy spicy is, I went with a level 3 on the salad. That was still spicy for me. I think I'll order a 2 next time. I can't imaging what a 10 is. \nThe pad Thai was ok. Sadly this one didn't please. I was hoping to find something wow about it but instead it was a bit sweet and oily. \n\nPresentation:\nThe papaya salad is good to share. It was huge and very pretty looking...\nThe pad Thai...well I don't think you can make it look pretty, but you can make it look tasty! \n\nOverall:\nLoved that I was able to find a new Thai dining option. Would I come here often? Not so much, but if I were in the area, sure. I'll be sure to try other dishes too. I do find pad Thai and papaya salad to be on the safe side. \n\nAs a vegan, be sure to be very specific with your server and check the food before you eat it. I learned that lesson hard after eating in San Diego. Here at Krung Siam, I had to send back the pad Thai because it had egg in it. \n\nHappy dining!"

The atmosphere was very lively and the waiting staff was friendly and quick.  I ordered the Pad Thai (Chicken) which was good, but maybe not great?  My girlfriends yellow curry on the other hand was pretty spectacular.\n\nThe one down side to the yellow curry though is that our 5 out of 10 spice choice was pretty dang spicy.  The waiters were laughing a little at her each time they filled her water cup that she kept having to retreat to.  Unless you are certain that you love spicy hot challenges, I would recommend getting a 3 and asking for some chili paste on the side to kick it up a notch.\n\nOverall, really good experience and look forward to going back.  Will update the review if the spiciness is a more tamable level next time."

I wanted to call in to order my food so by the time I arrived the food would be ready since I was on a time crisis! The lady on the phone said the restaurant was busy but said that's not a problem! We arrived and the place only had two tables being occupied so I'm not exactly sure what her definition of busy is! But overall the food was goooood, the service was friendly! Atmosphere is dark and they have a live band! The bathroom is a bit scary! Overall not too bad and the food was good and tasty! This place also opens really late with a bar!"

            "review": "The only good that came from eating here was that the bill was comped.\n\nWent for dinner 22 April. Everything was fine up until the part where people actually eat, which is a major issue being a restaurant. Two distinctly different dishes were ordered; yellow curry with tofu and Seafood Delight. Hers came out in a reasonable amount of time. I told her to not wait for me and eat, believing my order would be coming out shortly.\n\nMeanwhile, a table of two came in, and was seated at a table that was in my line of sight. They got their drinks, ordered and started to eat\n\nEvery so often, staff would peek around to see me, sitting there not eating. Eventually, one of the waitresses comes over.\n\n\"Is everything okay?\nEverything except I haven't received my order.\"\n\nMinutes later...\n\n\"Is everything okay?\nIs there something wrong in the kitchen? I'm still waiting for my food.\"\n\nHer response was that the order slipped through the cracks because of a larger party's (20+) order, which doesn't sound right. The party she was talking about was already seated and eating when we walked in, and the table that was seated in my line of sight came in after us and was already eating. Additionally, our order was taken on one ticket, not two (2) separate orders, so both orders should have been started at the same time\n\nMy plate finally shows up, but I'm so upset that I don't eat. For five minutes, I debate whether or not to ask for the manager. And again, every so often the staff would peek around to see me, sitting there and not eating. Was finally persuaded to just eat so we can leave.\n\nWe had finished our meals. The male waiter shows up, and asks how things are going. She had asked for a to go container, which was brought promptly. She filled the container with her leftovers, and the dishes were taken away.\n\nWe sat around for another 15 minutes. No one bothered to ask if we were ready for our check. That table of two? Already out the door. While we were waiting, we had a talk about her talking with management, because I knew she would be calmer than I would be. We go to the front and had to ask the hostess we would like to pay, but we never received a bill.\n\n\"What table was yours?\nThe table that had to wait over fifteen minutes for my dinner.\"\n\nAt that point, I pulled $25 out of my pocket, and handed it to her while taking her take out container. Was so livid that I told the hostess that she had something to say to management and I had to leave\n\nShe finally came out, and I got the lowdown.\n\n- A lot of apologies were given, but no real action to correct the situation (Which I take as, no one cares enough to follow up)\n- Of the three wait staff (2 F, 1 M) who came to our table, not once did the male member mention he was the manager\n- Lots of finger pointing going around: waitress(es) believed since the manager came over, he would take care of us; manager believed waitress(es) was still serving us."

The food and beverages were 15%\noff!!!! The spicy catfish, chicken satay, and spicy chicken krawpow were perfection.

I used to think it was alright, not too much flavor but recently I noticed a change. Although the portions got slightly smaller and prices went up $1-3 per item, the flavor was definitely kicked up! They have live music most nights and I like the atmosphere.\nMy favorites have been the Tom Kha, Panang Curry, Pad See Ew, Basil Fried Rice, Beef Salad, Garlic Shrimps, and their roti w/ coconut ice cream yum! Oh and also their Chang beer towers are a great deal at $18. Also, love their Thai tea bombs!!.\nThe items I didn't care for were their Cornish hen appetizer (hugeee but little flavor), chicken satay, and  thai bbq chicken. \nEverytime I've come in a large group of around 10 people (probably 35/50 times I've come here), we've been seated immediately and food has come fast. \nOverall I really enjoy this place especially now that it seems their food is much tastier. One star off just because like most places in Chinatown, service is lacking. Sometimes it takes forever for them to refill water and bring the check but food has always been fast and they've always been friendly so no problem. Definitely a regular :)"

Wow, they couldn't even offer anything else.\n\nThey charge over $12 for a main dinner entree which doesn't even amount to a lunch PORTION. They skimp you on everything. We went back last week and I ordered drunken noodles lunch special. They now charge $8.99 for it and its a BENTO BOX. I literally got 3 pieces of broken up noodles with 4 pieces of shrimp and a side of rice. Its not supposed to come with rice but they did it to make up for the noodles...so why even call it a noodle dish? It ended up being mostly veggies too. We send it back and they just took off the rice portion and added maybe a spoonful of noodles! It was a WTF moment.\n\nI highly suggest you stay away if you've had real Thai food and don't want to pay $12+ for a tiny dish! Their service and food has gone downhill.

Loved this. \n\nTofu Pad See You (their spelling, which is cute) - this was good as far as noodles go. Slightly sweeter than usual places and more heavy on the egg. I didn't mind it only because no matter what I always put a little bit of chili vinegar on mine to be tangy sweet but it may be a bit saccharine for some.\n\n No karaoke that night being done, but had music playing that sounded almost like a recording of karaoke which was funny and odd. \n\nIt left a good enough impression that the BF wanted to get scallops there again so we went back a week later. \n\nThis time we got scallops with ginger which was good, but bit too gingery for the BF and he preferred the basil style instead. \n\nWe also got tofu garlic pepper which was in a garlicky gravy like sauce. The garnish was generous with lettuce which I thought was kinda odd, but somehow worked well into being part of the dish when it was slightly wilted. \n\nThis time there was a guy with a guitar singing which was alright since the level wasn't too loud in there. It seems a lot of the complaints is because of the provided entertainment. I don't get it, I don't prefer it, but if I have to I won't mind so long as I can still have a conversation and be able to tune it out to background noise. \n\nService was alright both times...you may have to flag people down here if you need something but nothing too terrible of a wait for things. \n\nOverall, I like the food I've had here so I'll definitely come back.

Krung Siam is ok, but not sure it is my favorite of all places. The service was ok - it was not a busy night and they somehow managed to not get our order correct, even though the server had repeated what we wanted. \n\nWe ordered the yellow curry with tofu, beef drunken noodles, and the spicy chicken wings. The flavor for all of the dishes were good, although for medium spicy, it felt like it was more mild. Each Thai place is very different as I have been to other places that their mild was more like hot. I wish the restaurants were more consistent. For the price, the portion sizes were decent, but not huge. They also charge for extra rice. \n\nThe one good thing is they do have happy hour drinks/beers - so go before 8p and get your pints/pitchers for a great price!"

I would have given a better review if the curry cost a few dollars less. Not much taste and soggy tofu. The mango and sticky rice is a large portion for $7.99, but It definitely didn't need a rotten mint leaf garnish. The mango was good and there was a lot of it. Good points- it has great ambience, entertainment, and is very clean. It just seems that food quality and fresh ingredients are not a top priority at Krung Siam. $20 before tip for green curry and a mango sticky rice dessert.  Strike one for me."

I had been here once before, and I ordered a lackluster drunken noodle dish. Giving this place another chance (because I really like Thai), I ordered a lunch special Chicken Panang extra spicy with an appetizer of fresh spring rolls. To drink I ordered Thai Tea.\n\nThe Thai Tea came out with a glass of water. The water was clearly tap water. It had an odd aftertaste. One sip and I was done. The Thai Tea was meh.\n\nThe spring rolls were interesting. The menu indicated lettuce, bean sprouts, mint, sweet basil, cilantro, carrot and tofu. I received 4 rolls standing on one end. The top end overflowed with ingredients. The mint and basil were delicious. There was actually very little sprouts, and a lot more lettuce than in normal spring rolls. I prefer shrimp; however, I suspect they used Vietnamese pork sausage rather than tofu. Two rolls fell apart while trying to separate them from one another. While the actual spring rolls were lack luster, the peanut sauce included was actually quite good.\n\nThe soup included with the lunch special was a vegetable soup. I'm glad I asked, because they actually forgot to serve it to me. The Panang was not well done. Heat level was probably about a 3 (I asked for 15 on a scale of 1-10). The Panang was also very watery.\n\nI was disappointed. I don't think that I'll return to this restaurant again."

The last experience we had would keep us from ever going back. \n\nA few weeks back, my boyfriend and I went to have a late night dinner and a drink. Upon arrival, we waited for a table to be cleaned so that we could be seated. It wasn't at all that busy but the servers were really slow. Once we were seated, we noticed a table beside us that was still waiting to be cleaned, and probably a few others as well. Make a side note of that. \n\nAnyway, we picked our drinks and food and awaited a waiter. We finally snagged one and asked if we could order our drinks. They had told us that someone would be able to get to us shortly. Waiting patiently, a waiter finally came by and took our order. We then waited for about a good 10-15 mins for our drinks until we asked the waiter where they were. He said he would check. Drinks finally came and I didn't particularly like them so I gave them both to my boyfriend. As he was drinking it I noticed something floating in the drink. I then grabbed my phone to use as a flashlight to see what was it was. THERE WERE 3-4 BUGS IN THE DRINK. Still kicking and moving around. DISGUSTING. The fact that we had taken a few sips from the drink itself completely appalled me. We returned BOTH the drinks and asked for a manager. The manager, who had actually made and delivered the drinks, had tried to convince us that they were seeds probably. Uhm, seeds don't have legs and there aren't seeds in the drinks that we ordered. \n\nThe manager was very apologetic and paid for one of our meals. Still unforgiving, we wrote a little note on the receipt, didn't tip, and left knowing we would never come back. Oh, and that table beside us that was never cleaned... Never got cleaned up the entire time we were there."

The container is like a bento box with two sections -- entree on one side, eggroll in the other. The sauces from the entree will flow over and soak the eggroll. The server that took my order was very knowledgable and friendly. Restaurant was not at capacity, but then again, 1pm on a Wednesday afternoon. I keep hearing about a live band, but I guess that's only a evening thing."

So I know what I'm saying when I say this place was great! We were a bit iffy to come here b/c of the ratings...but I'm happy we did! \n\nWe got seated next to the little stage and speakers. First thought, damn, we're right next to the speakers! A young guy came on and started singing Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and stuff! He was playing the guitar while singing and he was realllly good! And no, sitting next to the speakers weren't bad at all. The sound system was well balanced. \n\nMy brother and I ordered the beef and chicken pad thai, that was prob one of the best I've had! My other bro just ordered the rib appetizers and it came out in a pan roast thingy in flames! So my 10 yr old bro thought he was tight lol. My parents ordered some chicken sour soup and fish and that was good too....idk if we just came on the right day or what, but all of our foods to be delicious! Would def come back again. \n\nAlso...try the Thai tea!!!"

Add a surprise discount (10%) and the fact that it's open until 6 in the morning (which is great for me personally)\n\nHowever, I have eaten here once before and got the pad thai.  That was pretty good, but definitely not great.  I'm surely going to be checking out this restaurant again in the near future.  They also are getting Chang beer on draft, and have a pretty cool special with a big tube of Chang for 15$ (It holds 6 beers and has a tap...perfect for groups of friends)."

Service that night was exceptional even though there were 12 of us. \nThe Chicken Pad Thai had to be the best ever!  We shared a few dishes and everyone agreed that this was one  of the best Pad Thai we've had.\n\nThe Tom Yum  soup was intensely flavored, loaded with chicken, veggies and dumplings.  No complaints here.\n\nThe Pork Larb was also outstanding but since I was the only one that had ever had this dish before I preferred that it had more cilantro and mint.  The others thought it was great.\n\nI loved the shrimp curry although my friends who don't like curry  didn't agree.  A matter of preference.  \n\n Three of us are going back in a couple of days and I will write another review then."

We were planing to go to another Thai restaurant but it was already around 10pm, the one we planed to go close at 11pm. So we decided to go this Thai restaurant instead since it opens until 5 in the morning. \n\nThe restaurant has a wall of wine in front of the bar seat, and as i walk in more, there is a stage with a guitar. The atmosphere is good and the only bad thing is it is too dark. The table next to us used their phone's flashlight to see the menu. \n\nWe started with a Tom Yum soup with shrimp. We order 2 level of spicy out of 10, but it was not as spicy as we thought. Some thai restaurant's level two could possibly kill me... The Tom Yum soup comes in a metal pot. It has a bright orange color, the soup is clear and watery. They use cocktail shrimp, which is moist and tender. I like it better than those skinny shrimp that is usually used. The soup is a little spicy and sour with a kind of scent strong of lemongrass.\n\nFor appetizer, we had a raw shrimp and papaya salad. The raw slimy shrimp is one of my favorite thai dish. It is like a Thai sashimi but with a little piece of garlic and a green spicy chili sauce which makes it a high note dish. The shrimp is gummy, moist and rubbery. The shrimp itself is bland, but it goes well with the garlic and the sauce. The sauce is a little sour but very spicy. Next one is the papaya salad, the salad is made with green papaya, peanuts, tomatoes and carrots. The salad is very fresh and crunchy with a sweet, sour and spicy lime sauce. However, it is too spicy that i only had one bite of it. \n\nFor entree, we had a basil fried rice with pork. It has a very strong basil smell with a colorful appearance. The rice is soggy, grainy and a little oily. The pork is tender and smooth. \nFor a good ending, we ordered a mango sticky rice. Its bottom has a layer of sticky rice and top with a whole mango with some coconut sauce. Is rice is very gummy, soggy and creamy. The mango is not sour at all, which is quite sweet with the sweet coconut sauce. The coconut flavor is just right as it will not cover the taste of mango but goes well with it. \n\nIn conclusion, the food is tasty and the service is wonderful. As the salad is too spicy to eat, i drank a lot of water and they refill the water very quickly. And as we were ready to order, I looked at one of the server and he came immediately to take our order. In the middle of our meal, a performer went onto the stage and started to perform some nice song which makes our whole experience even better!"

There's a guy with a great voice who sing oldies there on friday and saturday night, so if you're into that, it's a great place to enjoy some chill music. Otherwise, they have late night karaoke on the stage during the week = *avoid late nights if you don't like drunk people screaming into the mic while you eat*\n\nThe food here is average and they have a scale of 1-10 for spiciness. Ask the waiter for reference because the spiciness ratio is different for each dish. A level 5 salad is as spicy as a level 10 curry. It also depends on how much coconut milk is in the curry. So if you don't want to take the risk, better to ask when you're ordering."

The second time I came to try their fabulously priced lunch deals at $4.99.  Both times I really enjoyed the food.  \n\nOn visit one, we ordered pork larb, yellow chicken curry and red beef curry.  The larb was outstanding, and the curries were tasty and spiced just to the level we had asked for.  Service was a little spotty, meaning it was hard to get a server's attention, but not so bad as to be off-putting.  There was live entertainment with a woman singing love songs, and the restaurant had a cute ambiance with dark red walls and fairy lights on the ceiling.  Although it wasn't packed, the restaurant was almost full and it was obvious they do good business.\n\nOn visit two, we came around 1pm for lunch.  They have $1 thai iced teas and coffees as part of the deal, which is so cool!   The lunch menu is pretty extensive with about 10 different dishes, and your choice of meats or tofu.  They all come with a small soup and rice too.  I had the pork panang and it was delicious and a generous portion!  I think this is one of the best lunch deals that I've found yet in Las Vegas!"

I'm always a little overwhelmed by yellow curry so I didn't like it, but if you enjoy yellow curry, you'll probably like this.\n\nThe red curry was powerful and had lots of bamboo to munch on. I found it very agreeable to my palate.\n\nThe basil chicken was pretty bad. I got what appeared to be shredded chicken drenched in some kind of overpowering sweet sauce. I have no idea whether it was chicken, pork, or beef, so that says a lot about the dish. Anyway, it was pretty bad and I find it hard to believe it's the \"most popular entree\" as listed on the menu.\n\n3 stars only because of the live entertainment. Otherwise, the food is really meh and you're paying like $12 per dish.\n\nInterior is dark and loud because of the music. Comfy, I suppose. Service was outstanding."

I guess none of us felt like getting ripped off anymore from expensive hotel eateries.  We went to Krung Siam simply by luck.  We were planning on going to the Pho place in the same plaza but somehow Thai food seemed more inviting at that moment.\n\nThe decor at Krung Siam was surprisingly nice.  It had a loungy restaurant feel unlike any other Thai place I've ever been too.  There were candles on the tables and the servers were all very friendly.  Best of all, they ad $4 buy one get one free bottles of imported beer.  Wow, that is cheap coming from the Strip where one bottle would run $7-9 bucks!\n\nWe ordered the Pad Thai, Chicken Green Curry and Glass Noodle Salad.  We orderd everything medium spicy but the food came out SUPER spicy.  So a word of caution, if you can't handle spicy food, ask them for low low spice.  They had a spice scale from 1-10, we got 5 but next time I'll know to get 2 or 3.\n\nI was pleasantly delighted to see the large portions and taste the great flavors.  This was one of the better Thai places I've ever been too....mind you I was pretty drunk so my review might be a tad skewed.  Nevertheless, this place is definitely going to be one of our usual places off the Strip."

I thought I could handle the spice so I asked for Level 8.  After one sip, I chugged half a pitcher of water.  After 2 sips, I begged for death.  And yet I went for a third sip.  I lost feeling in my fingers.  But it was so tasty!  Upon touching my tongue for the 4th sip, I started having visions of pokemon dancing around a blue pelican.  I blacked out.  Two days later, I awoke in Yan Nawa with nothing but my ex-wife's passport and half a twizzler in my pocket.  I wandered north for several hours.  I fear Bangkok has me now."

The staff is all Thai which is a good sign, obviously, that you'll get authentic food. Karaoke and live music on different nights. Great for dates but be prepared to pay a little extra. Can become pricey. A couple things that I've never heard of before I tried and was not impressed. But everything else is really good. Stick with what you know and you should be fine. Cool atmosphere and easy to find."

Okay, lets skip all the ridiculous intros and get into this review\n\nThis place was really appealing to me for some odd reason.  A cool mechanical waterfall when you enter the restaurant, dimly lit, neon everywhere, a stage for live music and waitresses walking around with bunny ears? Definitely a place different from where I normally eat at but I do enjoy the charm. \n\nService: Was absolutely great!  The guy we had was very cordial, made sure our glasses were always full (big plus) and was very pleasant.  Towards the end of our meal, the manager took our leftovers and personally placed them into individual boxes (YES!). \n\nFood: The sauce that accompanies a lot of the dishes I got the spring rolls which were perfectly crunchy and flaky without destroying the contents.  The drunken noodles were a yelp favorite? but really wasn't that great.  It was like a 80:20 ratio of vegetables/meat to noodles and the noodles were more like sheets.  The Thai BBQ chicken gets  flambed which is pretty freaking cool but make sure you move the chicken off the plate and onto your plate or else it'll burn the bottom.  The fried rice and pad thai looked good so i'll definitely will get those next time. \n\nMusic: We had a guy playing a guitar while we were eating which was pretty charming.  \n\nOverall: Great place to eat whether it be afternoon or late night."

The only thing I really don't agree on is the price. $11 for pad thai with chicken. And $14 for pad thai with shrimp is a bit much for the portion. I ordered the basil chicken, I might be expecting much since I'm thai but still, the basil chicken doesn't really taste that great to me. But the pad thai and pad see ew and I guess everyone said that it was good. Another thing I liked is that they got my orders right. It a bit complicated but the orders came all correct.

So choosing this one was strictly based of Yelp reviews. Man am I glad we listened.\n\nWalked in and first thing you see is a gorgeous stream of water running down a mirrored wall. At night it's beautiful and adds flair as you walk in. We were immediately greeted and sat. Restaurant wasn't too busy but again it was early dinner. I don't mind when it's slower because my food is faster and always tastes better. \n\nWe ordered our drinks and appetizers off the bat. We got and order of crab rangoons and a platter which consisted of chicken satay, spring rolls, crab Rangoons and pork dumplings. Each having their own sauce to dip in such as sweet and sour and peanut sauce. Best satay I have had in a LONG time. Spring rolls weren't my favorite but everything else was good for an app.\n\nOur server came to take our order. He didn't write it down but spoke it back to us perfectly. Food came out staggered with entrees. I think they thought we were doing family style which we were not. So my meal came about 5 minutes later.\n\nThe staff seems to work as a team because I had about 4 different people waiting on us from order taking, to bussing, to drink refills. Team work makes it work better. I didn't sit there waiting for anything because someone was always around.\n\nI obviously ordered Pad Thai. As we all know on here that's like all I get. Their spice meter is all over the place. I can handle spice and the 2 was a lot. For me it tasted great. For some at the table it was TOOOO hot and that was just a 2 out of 10.\nPad Thai was great. Didn't have too many peanuts which I like an abundance of. I actually added pineapple to it and it made it even better. Try it next time you get pad Thai. All meals were large and can be split for two or good for take home left overs.\n\nWe all saw fried bananas on the menu so you KNEW that was happening. Came out at a good time. Not overly battered and very warm. The bananas were very tasty. I thought it was a caramel sauce on it but it was honey and I hate honey so I had to eat around it :( we had ours served with mango and coconut ice cream.\n\nOther than that this place is great! Defiantly check it out if you are in China town. I know there is a lot to choose from but you won't regret this place."

Also they have a happy hour for the draft beer, i think its from 4-8pm $2 for a glass and $6 for a pitcher!! This is really cheap!!! Omg!!!  I will come back here again and again absolutely!!!"

Let's face it... the only justification for Thai food having such prices is that it's pretty close to the strip; otherwise, it's better to go to other Thai restaurants throughout Vegas that are more reasonable. \n\nDespite the prices, the food is certainly 4 stars! We ordered several dishes and shared \"family-style\" and were able to try a little bit of everything. Bowl of seafood soup, fried rice, chicken, the popular basil dish, green curry, and pad thai...  I love that you can specify the level of spice for your meal ... levels one through ten. \n\nI finally went back a 2nd... and 3rd time and had a chance to order my dish 10/10 level the 2nd time and 15/10 level ;) the 3rd time. They did a fantastic job with the level of spice, and when I didn't like my first order *(for the first time in my life I found a dish I do not care for... it's the Thai beef noodle soup... the flavor was not enjoyable for me)*... the waiter was kind enough to replace my order with the Drunken Noodles, one of my all time favorite Thai dishes, which was EXCELLENT. \n\nI will definitely be going back... just not too frequently because it'll probably burn a hole in my wallet ;)."

Sorry Alex!\n\nMy main reason for the mediocre rating is #1 The prices and #2 I just don't like the place.\n\nI think having a stage is so cheesy for a Thai restaurant. Thai's know how to get down on karaoke and I'm sure everyone's family has a machine at home, but unfortunately the talent they choose at this restaurant for the entertainment is definitely just like at home.\n\nThe Thai videos playing are also just cheesy.\n\nAnd please turn some lights on at night, most the diners are drunk and can't see.\n\nI've been here a couple times. The first time was when my friend was visiting from out of state (he's the chef's son). We got a bit of a discount, and even a free entree, but the price was up there for Thai food. \n\nIt is a nice establishment as far as the decor, and that it isn't a little hole in the wall, but add the mediocre service to the equation and it just doesn't do it for me. Maybe that's the voice of my Thai mom who left it instilled in my head that her food will always be better than any restaurant and cheaper. Krung Siam doesn't prove my mom wrong.\n\nI've had their grilled beef salad, their version of combination pho, and pad se ew, and the yellow chicken curry.\n\nPho was definitely mediocre, beef salad was really good quality, the side of sticky rice was microwaved too much, pad se ew was good, and the yellow chicken curry had a lot of filler.\n\nTheir Thai tea sucks too.\n\nOverall i'm just not convinced there's anything special about this place in any category. The food is decent, the prices are understandable, the service is medicore.\n\nI'd only go back for a late night craving as most Thai places are closed late at night."

Well I mean if you want to embrace 'murica then eat the whole dish by all means. No one is judging. Lol shit I would if I was hungry enough.\n\nTHE FOOD:\n\n- Fresh Spring Rolls w/ Peanut Sauce - The sauce was good. I like my food spicy so I put a lot of that red chili sauce in it. The spring rolls were meh. Too much bean spouts so it lacked flavor unless I got some mint or something. I could make better ones at home.\n\n- Chicken Satay - The chicken was juicy and  it was full of flavor. Definitely try it. You can't really go wrong with chicken satay.\n\n- Seafood Rad Na - This is a dish I grew up eating since I was a little chubby fat girl waddling around. This Rad Na definitely did not disappoint and it had more seafood in it than other ones that I have had. It was flavorful, balanced, and oh so yummy! Mix it with some of those pickled jalape\u00f1os and you got yourself a winner!\n\n- Basil Fried Rice - This. This made me regret ordering spring rolls. It was soooo good. None of the flavors overpowered one another and they put a lot of basil and bell peppers. We got the medium spice level because some people can't hang but it was still good. There was a little tickle of spice tingling my senses like the Taco Bell Fire hot sauce. So it was like a tease to my taste buds, then the spice was gone. I wish I could eat more right now. But god damn, carb overload.\n\nOverall, food was great and service was on point. Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely be coming back to try some more food."

(((True to spice))) Even their chili tray had everything you need: thai chilies in fish sauce, Serrano chilies in vinegar, sugar, and dry powdered chilies. The chilies were very spicy and flavorful (not for the faint of heart.)\n\nWe've also tried their other dishes and they aren't half bad - I just found minor annoyances with them. \n\nPanang beef curry - Their version was watery, I prefer my curry thick. But the overall curry was actually flavorful. 3/5\n\nBeef pad see ew - great flavor and very generous on the beef, I just wish they offered more noodles to balance the dish out. 4/5\n\nBig plus that they are open late!

            "review": "I've drove by this place many times on my way home and today I finally decided to stop here and try their food. \n I ordered my thai favorite tom yum soup and the seafood delight. The soup wasn't the best I've ever had and the sad part is that I've had better tom yum soup at my own kitchen, the soup was too sweet for my taste. The seafood delight was kind of good, some kind a mixture of fruit of the sea mixed with Asian vegetables served on a sizzling plate and a side of steamed rice, not bad food but nothing that would make me make that illegal u turn on valley view again.\n The price you pay for the food should come with better than fast food restaurant service but that's just what we got. Waitress took our order delivered the food and we were left on our own for the rest of the meal, not even checked on us once. By the end of the meal I was chewing on ice to help me swallow the rest of my food. I even had to do that embarrassing signature on the air to get the check and signed it while the dirty plates were still on the table. I started to wonder if I had to pick the plates up on my way out. \nAs we left no one said thank you........is it asking for too much after leaving 20% tip for no service?\nIf I ever go back I'll make sure I go there during karaoke time and sing gangnam style as their punishment!"

Stay away from the soups, they are too bland. Their house special thai style crispy chicken is very tasty and works well with spices. Meat larb is only ok, but then again I don't care for larb. Drunken noodles are only average here. Satay chicken avg as well."

Was it the best curry that I've ever had? Almost. Mix Zone Three Color FTW!\n\nI popped in here for a quick lunch, only because I saw a sign that said $4.99 lunch special. I figured, why not.\n\nI took one star off from this review for two reasons (and these can easily be remedied):\n\n1. I was not offered water until several minutes. It's 113 degrees outside. I was jonesin for a glass.\n\n2. The lunch special includes the soup of the day, and they ran out by 2pm (lunch ends at 3). \n\nI ordered the Panang Curry with Shrimp (a dollar more than the special price).\n\nThe curry was flavorful, and the portions were appropriate for lunch. The menu is pretty diverse, and you have lots of great options. When I come back, I'll explore.\n\nThe ambiance is pretty cool. Dark, nicely air-conditioned, and clean. The place seems fairly new. Flat screen TV's and sparkly christmas lights fall from the ceiling.\n\nThere is a stage, where they seem to have karaoke and other forms of live entertainment. Decent Happy Hour. Half off drinks from 3-7 M-F.\n\nOne last note...this place is open until 4am. Might be a good spot for late night post-club grub. Just a thought.\n\nIn summary? Good spot. Possibly great."

Huge portion!\n\nPanyang curry - very delicious and sweet and smooth. \n\nWill try more food next time.\n\nDownside is the delivery guy took an hour to come even though they were 5 min away from us... And then the delivery guy couldn't figure out how to get into the building cause he went to the wrong entrance... Had to come down from my room to find him ...

The lunch menu itself has about 10 items on it and the dishes start at $5.99 which includes steamed rice and soup. It's a little more expensive if you upgrade the protein to shrimp or mixed seafood. \n\nThe soup that accompanishes the meal is a tangy tomato soup. I can't complain much since it was included, but it wasn't my favorite. It just had the consistency and color of sweet and sour sauce and it was just a little odd. \n\nOverall this is a good place to get your Thai fix without busting your wallet.

The place was nice inside as well as clean. Once we entered we were seated almost promptly. The menu appeared extensive and prices were a little too high I think for just Thai food off the strip but for sure cheaper than the Vegas strip food!  I thought perhaps portions would be larger due to the high prices when actually they are only moderate and marginal for family style dining.  We ordered the green curry with tofu, drunken noodles and Tom-kha kai soup dishes.  Price at the end for all three meals and drinks is about $38 (after 10pm is happy hour and it was advertised 15% off the total bill).  Service is very swift and it seems this place is popular since it was filled up but not packed.  At around 10:30pm or so a singer sang 80's music live on stage. Overall the food was good but too pricey, place is clean but seating area was too dim. The music can play a little too loud so I had a difficult time overhearing friends' conversations."

While we were standing waiting for someone to seat us, servers just pass us by not saying a word to us. We waited for about 10 minutes and still no one approached us so my coworker goes to the bar and tells them. Then a guy grabs the menus and just starts walking (keep in mind he doesn't even say a damn word to us) so we followed because he must be seating us. 10 minutes pass by and still no one to take our orders (I would of walked right out but we were on lunch and very hungry). So in order for us to order we had to get up and give them our order while not once did they come to get our order or even check up on us. So we asked the person at the bar who is our server and it was a young lady! We were so pissed off because here she goes to the table next to us who just got seated and she already gets their orders, then she looks at us and walks away doesn't even say hi or have you been helped. Anyway, with that being said it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out....our lunch was ruined had to go back to work by the time we got our food. \n\nThe food is good and not bad for $4.99 lunch special and $1.00 Thai tea! \n\nVery very bad service and I am probably not the only one that experienced it because there were a bunch of angry people that just walked out. For example: there were two guys having lunch and oh my were they mad because apparently they forgot the other guys order and only brought one order out. They just walked out without paying! Hey I don't blame them because I would have done the same thing!"

If I'd have waited for his food to come out, mine would have been cold. \n\nThe plus side is that the food is always good.

I think I'll skip the pad thai next time, but I'll return to try other lunch specials."

Crying tiger dish is so succulent it melts in your mouth. Lunch specials are a really good deal. $15 beer tower and $2 draft beer during happy hour. It's a relaxed kind of vibe so it's a nice little spot to chill with your friends and get your grub on. And the spice levels are pretty accurate. I love my spices and I'm usually at a 5 or 6, if you can get to 10 then you're probably a dragon, and that's fine with me but don't breathe on me  (^_^) The best part about this place is that it's open so late. After a long night sometimes you just want to sit down and eat some good food where it's not so noisy."

I had reviewed the menu online and was pleasantly surprised to see a number of Salmon dishes available as lunch specials.  Salmon Basil, Salmon with Garlic, Three Taste Salmon.   My head was spinning with daydreams of trying each and every one and incorporating KST into my list of go-to restaurants for relatively healthy lunch options.   Plus they have brown rice! It was love at first menu review.\n\nCall in the order. \"We don't have salmon anymore\"   Okay Chicken Basil it is, spiced 7/10.   Ho hum.  But still, brown rice! :D\n\nWhen I walked in, I was surprised to see a large, extremely busy restaurant.  I don't know what I was expecting or why I was expecting it, but it wasn't that.  I actually waited for a couple in front of me to be seated and informed the waiter I had a take out order.  He was extremely efficient and friendly and got me in and out of there in about 2 minutes flat.\n\nBack to the office the disappointments started to pile up.   First, inside the bag was simply my entree in a takeout container.  No napkins, no plasticware, no sauces, literally just the takeout container.  How is at least a napkin and fork set not a standard take out provided item?   Actually opening the entree led to more disappointment.   Their website states (along with the non-existent salmon dishes): \"Served with steamed or fried rice, egg roll, wonton, salad, and soup of the day.  Soup not included in togo order\"   Well, there wasn't ANYTHING other than my entree and rice.  No egg roll, no wonton, no salad.  Now as I said before, it was pretty busy so I can forgive some oversight, but to miss out on providing 3 of the 5 components of a take out lunch special, and to not provide napkins or plasticware?   \n\nBut still, brown rice!!!!!!    Well, not quite.  For the next disappointment, the rice provided inside the 2/3 full takeout container (I assume the 1/3 was supposed to have the salad and/or eggroll and wonton) was regular steamed white rice.  \n\nHere's the kicker, I actually enjoyed what I received quite a bit.  The chicken was nicely ground up, and the dish had a great flavor overall.  The rice wasn't as sticky as I usually like and almost ventured into Uncle Ben's like levels of separation.  The spice level was a little more intense than I usually look for in a 7, but I wouldnt mind so much if it wasn't for the other oversights.\n\nAll in all I have to go with a 2.  Had they gotten the order correct and provided me with what I ordered, it would have been a solid 3 for sure.  Brown rice :("

So I asked for a manager. no manager was working so I spoke with a senior employee who also didn't speak English. She explained to me that the soup was sent back and it was mixed with a soup mix since we already ate some of it (we literally had one bite and sent it back) after it getting sent back twice we finally got a new one.

But consistency is really the key, I prefer a place that is always C than a place that is 98% A+ and 2% F. \n\nI used to order the tom yum soup with shrimp, which I always liked with spicy level 6. Not too spicy, not too mild for my taste. This last time, I'm ordering for the table, so I ask for less spicy than normal at 5, it's comes so ridiculously spicy that is not possible to eat it. I think okay, maybe only the mistake is in the soup, but when the food came with spicy levels of 4-6, same thing. MUCH MUCH hotter than my previous experiences (the previous time, maybe the prior week)\n\nAs the result, my friends have stomach pain all morning today.  \n \nIn addition to that, our waitress was very very rude - showing us lots of attitude. They bring one of our plates 15 minutes before the other ones. I handed her my plate, and asked her if she could bring it with the rest of the food, and she literally rolled her eyes and left the plate down. Later on, she pours the soup on a friend, and doesn't even apologize. Unbelievable. \n\nYou might ask, why didn't you ask them to take the spicy food back to the kitchen. Because the waitress was so unaccommodating that we didn't feel like that is an option.\n\nIt really sounds I'm making this up or exaggerating, right? This many bad things can't happen all on the same day, you'd say. There might have been something wrong with this dude and his friends. Trust me, it was worse than I explained. I have eaten out most nights last 7-8 years, and this was the very first time I left $0 tip, and that was before hearing of stomach problem of my friends this morning.\n\nTo be fair and give benefit of the doubt, this was the night before Christmas, and they might have been out of their usual staff."

We usually eat at  Pho Little Saigon across the parking lot but was drawn in by the Thai food (both in a plaza near China Town). Krung Siam's decor was mostly wood and it was very dim at night, I couldn't see much but who's looking at each other when we're nose to plate w/ such good food?\n\nWe ordered satay, chicken krapow, crispy pork w/ chinese broccoli, and spicy catfish (pad ped pla dook). There wasn't one dish that I didn't fully enjoy. Everything on our table (except the glasses of water) was spicy, full of flavor, and just darn right satisfying. Every heaping spoonful of food that went into my mouth was a buddha-sent heaven, or hell since it's spicy, you know.\n\nIf you're asking if this place serves authentic Thai food, YES. Very authentic, so not everyone will be accustomed to the unusual and potent flavors. Is it affordable? YES. Will  I drive you there? Believe me, if I could I would haul every single reader into a giant container truck and drive there right now. Convinced yet?"

Might have gotten the basil fried rice a little too spicy at around a 5 so I guess this place is really serious when it comes to spicyness!! Both the dishes were superb!\n\nHOWEVER, the service was horrible to non-existent.  I am use to getting low service since I look young but mind you, I am 21 years old and my boyfriend is 22 so I really don't understand why we were ignored! Water was never refilled and since I ordered the spicy fried rice, I had to flag down the waiter three times to get my water refilled! The table only had one place setting when we sat down so we flagged down a waiter for a setting but instead just got a fork!!!! All the waiters seemed to go around the other tables to make sure they were doing fine but skipped ours. This was by far the worst service I have ever had. Maybe it was just a mistake/accident but I will definitely find another thai place that will serve the same quality food with better service."

The food came out less than 7 minute for 5 dishes. (Sorry! no pics, bf's dad was hungry and dig in) Anyways, here the break down.....\n\n1.) Pad thai = 2/5, about $11 or so, small portion. too sweet. noodle wasn't the right one for pad thai.\n2.) Pad see you/ew? idk how to spell it properly : 3/5 (best dish out of all) cost like $10\n3.) Seafood fried rice = tasteless......cost like 10 dollars or so. 1/5\n4.) Krung Siam platter. I believe it was 15 DOLLARS!!! LET ME TRY TO remember....what it had....2 eggrolls, 3 crab puff, 3 wonton, 2 satay chicken....so expensive, and it didn't even taste good!! Idk, why they order it..... 1.5/6 \n6.) Beef Salad. Beef taste so hard and dry. Smells strong for some reason. We didn't finish that dish\n\nThai Tea tastes like bottled ones where u can get at the super market.\nhot tea is about 2 dollars and iced tea is about 2 dollars.\n\n\n\nWish the people who came with me didn't suggest thai food blah.\n\nSorry if my typing is messy.

I ordered a Thai Red Curry to-go and the waitress/bartender took my order to the kitchen. We waited for about 15minutes for our food to be ready, quite fast considering its 1am in the morning and in between, th waitress even served us iced water! The place was playing thai music videos off youtube on a tv screen and it just kind of creates a very relaxing atmosphere.\n\nWell back to the food, back at the hotel, when i opened my container of Thai Red Curry, i was immediately overwhelmed by the smell of red curry and i knew i hadn't made a wrong choice coming. The curry was thick and rich, and the serving was generous, there were lots of meat and potatoes inside the curry, enough to fill my famished stomach. The jasmine rice they used for the steamed rice was of a good quality the portion was also large. My stomach was very happy after that:)"

I had a few slurps of it and wasn't a fan :[ As for the Drunken Noodles, Krung Siam has you choose on a scale from 1 to 10 how spicy you want your noodles. Why did I say 9? I HAVE NO IDEA! I'm a fan of spicy foods, but maybe I should have gotten a 7! Once my noodles came out, you could smell the load of chili peppers that were mixed into the dish. Before I even had a bite, I knew how spicy my meal was gonna be...and how I would regret it soon after we had left the restaurant and came back to the hotel :[ Poor tummy. Poor toilet :[ Nonetheless, it was still perfectly edible, but I wish I had gone for something more on a medium spice level to actually enjoy it. If you can take on the spice, try getting it at a 10!

Waitstaff was very friendly, and my drink & appetizer arrived quickly, with my entree showing-up a suitable amount of time later.       Ambience is kind of like a bar/lounge (which is I think how the place markets itself).  They had music up somewhat loud.  Not uncomfortably so, but if you're there on a date or with a group of people, it might be hard to carry on much of a conversation.\n\n I was there on a Thursday evening at about 6PM.   The place wasn't crowded at all.  For this type of place plus being in Vegas, I was probably there at least an hour or two before it might start to get busy."

First, they tried to sit us at a table. When we're standing near the table getting ready to sit, another waiter came over and told the hostess not to sit us there so we had to go back and wait again. 5 minutes later we finally sit down. \n\nWhen getting our drinks, the waiter asks if we are \"local\". We found this odd because usually people as if we're visiting or not. What does it mattter if we're local? We tell the waiter we're visiting for the holiday. After getting our drinks, we're told to move again because someone just put in a reservation for 12 and they needed room.\n\nWhile ordering, we specifically tell the waiter to bring out the appetizers first before the entrees. The table we had was small so we didn't want the clutter. My mother's Rad Nah dish comes out first anyways. We tell them to take it back and bring out the dish when we all get our entrees. The appetizers were papaya salad and thai beef salad. They taste ok but I've had alot better. When the entrees come out, we find that all the meat is not cook thoroughly in most our dishes. In my brother's pad thai, the imitation crab meat was not even cooked. It looked they threw the meat in straight from the package. After asking for the dish to be recooked, the pad thai comes back super sweet like someone dumped some high fructose corn syrup on the dish. The dish in inedible. My mother's dish also has meat that is under cooked. She just eat the noodles trying not to cause a fuss. My dish was ok. Crispy pork that was a little salty but at least edible.\n\nMaybe if we told the waiter we were local, we would have been treated better. Since we're visiting and might not come back for a while, the restaurant acted like they didn't care about us.\n\nIn the end, we just went to In-N-Out Burger.

When we didn't want to spend an arm and a leg to dine on The Strip, we'd just hop on over here.  Last year, I even had my Wedding Rehearsal Dinner here because the place is fairly nice, the food is good, and it's a great bang for the buck.  Well, now I drop down to just two stars for this reason alone:  They upped the prices at least $5 per item for the exact same food, atmosphere, quality, service, etc.  Nothing about the restaurant has changed, in my eyes, except for the price.  The portions didn't change...nothing.  It irks me that a place thinks they can up their prices drastically just because they're trying to be slightly more high-end.  I think I paid something like $13 for Yellow Chicken Curry.  Something I can get for $8 at any other Thai restaurant of the same caliber elsewhere.  Service wasn't even good to make up for the increased prices.  The place was empty and I felt like we waited a little long to place our order, for the food, and to pay the check.  For this price, we could've just stayed on The Strip and dined in one of the casinos or malls.  I admit, yes, the food is still good but it doesn't warrant paying the increased prices."

I personally did not experience a difference in quality in the food but two of my coworkers complained that the dishes they normally get had changed in flavor and were not as good. They also dropped a couple favorites. I enjoyed the addition of the crab rangoon and would have been okay with the salad but the dressing is not very good.

We have sampled tom kha gai and tom yum soups, red curry and the dish simply called \"Broccoli.\" A bowl of soup is quite generous, and both soups had a rich, pleasing flavor. However, they also come served with lots of the herbs and roots that contribute to this flavor, which is mildly frustrating if you're not one to chew down on lemongrass and galanga. I admit this may be a white girl thing, but I end up putting all those things on the side because they seem too tough to chew. Am I wrong?\n\n(I decided to Google and thanks to Kasma Loha-unchit and her article here http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/lemongrass.html learned: \"In soups, lemongrass serves as a stock ingredient to flavor the broth; the tough pieces are not meant to be chewed and eaten. Thai people usually do not strain them out before serving; they know what can be eaten and what cannot, and some like to suck on the lemongrass pieces for a delightful hit of flavor.\")\n\nSo, it is more authentic way to serve the soups, and I am just being a baby. \n\nThe curry was good. The \"Broccoli\" had a great wok flavor, but the sauce was a little light, and their steamed tofu isn't my favorite.\n\nSo, why won't we repeat eat? It was most likely a late night destination for us given its hours, and the fact that during the day we have some fave go-to spots. And, late night they have live entertainment which created a less than ideal dining environment. It is simply one gentleman with a guitar and a semi-karaoke set up, but it is a little loud and prone to drunk hijinx. If you are also drunk, wildly entertaining, but if you are just hungry, a boozy lady sitting on stage doing her best to belt out Bob Dylan and other songs that the guitar man simply just doesn't know for close to 20 minutes is simply frustrating. I don't even know if it was supposed to be karaoke, or if she just decided she had the right to sing. I can appreciate a well done, Thai karaoke throw down, but that is not what was happening here. I suppose the restaurant isn't completely to blame for their patron's less than ideal manners, but I kept hoping someone would kindly escort her back to her table with the lure of some free delicious item.\n\nIf we walk up to the door and see the man on the stage, we will probably decide it's not the meal for us given the opportunity for microphone takeovers. However, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the food, and our service was acceptable. Definitely worth it at a late hour when you're running out of options, and, hey, perhaps the danger of late night karaoke is your thang! Maybe we will return for lunch."

            "review": "I love this place. Whenever me and my boyfriend go they have karaoke, which is entertaining. We've tried all their curries and while they are all really good, we decided last night that the yellow curry with vegetables is our favorite. We usually get around a 3 on the spicy level just because I feel like the spicier it is the more it takes away from the actual flavor. And this place is definitely full of flavor when it comes to their curry and noodles. The drunken noodles are definitely my go to. I went about a month ago and they had run out of the drunken noodles which I was bummed about, but I can't blame them because they are amazing! I ended up getting the pad Thai and it was almost equally as good. The only thing I wouldn't recommend on the menu was the fresh spring rolls. The peanut sauce it came with was good but the overall roll lacked flavor and tasted like lettuce. We decided we should have just gotten the fried spring rolls. Maybe next time! But I do highly recommend the Thai Siam tea on the drink menu, best spiked Thai tea ever!"

            "review": "Visiting Vegas, was in the mood for late night Thai food. Found Krung Siam on Yelp and decided to give them a try. I called for delivery, and they weren't sure at first if they could deliver to the hotel I was at(Marriott Grand Chateau) After confirming they could deliver that far, I decided to try the Basil Fried Rice and the BBQ Thai Chicken. Literally after I called, it took them an amazing 20 minutes to deliver the food, while estimating 45 minutes! The food quality was pretty good as well, and not overly expensive for the amount of food. The only thing was when I ordered how spicy I wanted the fried rice to be, I ordered a 10 on a 1-10 scale, and wasn't too spicy, but that might just be me. Overall, great find. Great portion sizes for a reasonable price, and FAST delivery."

Everything was delicious! The food came out super fast and theyre conveniently open til 6 am. The booth we got for 5 was also big and spacious so we didnt have to bump elbows while eating. The curry was so flavorful and had a hint of spice to it (not too spicy but just enough) combined with the side of white rice ouweeeeeee. Definitely have to come back for.more whenever im in vegas"

Workers would glance at me and not say anything. They were busy, so I took a seat and waited another 10 minutes. I wasn't greeted, and just sat there. Got fed up and left."

We both finished our water and had to ask for more.   Then, finished our food for a solid 5-10 mins before we were finally successful in flagging someone down for our check."

            "review": "The atmosphere reminds of Firefy- dimly lit, loud music, and close seating. It was hard to have a conversation in such close quarters, but the live band kept us entertained and we shortly got our entrees after.\n\nDrunken noodles: pick your choice of meat and spice. We got chicken in medium spice. There were plenty of bell peppers, chicken, and tomatoes...but where's the noodles? I was a little disappointed for not having enough noodles. But it was flavorful and had a perfect amount of spice and plenty of leftover meat and veggies after the noodles were gone! \n\nThai chicken: when the server brought it out, he poured some liquid over it to make it sizzzzle! Talk about dinner and show! And it came with two dipping sauces, one was a sweet chili sauce and the other had a spicy/fish sauce/lime taste to it. The chicken was juicy and tasty by itself! But the sauces did elevate the flavors and give it that Thai twist! \n\nSpring rolls: I didn't realize they weren't the fresh kind. It was the fried egg rolls filled with noodles and vegetables. It also came with a delicious dipping sauce that was different from the sweet chili sauce given to us with the chicken. It was my favorite of the three sauces we got! They also cut the spring rolls in half, but they're as big as normal sized eggs rolls. \n\nI love how they're open late and not too far from the strip. Great place to grab food after work. And I did see a beer tower advertised for $18 all day! A lot of people ordered pad thai and fried rice when I went, so I'm gonna go back and give that a try!"

Food was high quality, nice portions, (my sister and I shared the beef salad while we were deciding what else to order and the portion was so generous, that's all we had.)  The Singha Beer was excellent, served in frozen glasses that made the beer even better.  The music was excellent and it was cozy and the booths gave us privacy.  I'd definetly recomment this place for a lunch experience."

We finished the first 4 dishes and the last one still never arrived yet. The food isn't anything fancy either. I do not recommend coming here at all. Oh and to top it off, while I was washing my hands in the restroom I watched a waiter walk out of the only stall and out of the restroom without washing his hands. That pretty much sealed the deal. Never coming back here again."

My party had ordered shrimp pad thai, beef jerky, and the crazy wings. \n\n-Shrimp pad thai: flavorful and so darn good! \n-Beef jerky:  a bit of a disappointment, only because the portion was so small compared to a thai restaurant back home. \n- Crazy wings: Not too fond of it, but my friends devoured it lol. \n\nRandom, but I got a little freaked out going to the restroom just because I was alone and it was so quiet lol. Anyone else feel the same?"

            "review": "Had an awful experience here last night. I normally wouldn't write a bad a review to hurt a business being that I've worked in restaurants for many years but I was very disappointed with this place. I came last night around midnight with a small group of friends. It took about 10 minutes for someone to see us waiting at the host stand to finally seat us. It was busy but not packed. Once we were seated we all figured out what we wanted to eat and waited atleast 15-20 minutes for someone to see us sitting with no waters and no service so a female came frantically over once she noticed us, took our order and food came out at a decent time. The food was good! That's the only good thing that came out of going here. I asked for napkins and chilli sauce when the food came, but never received it. We had all finished our meals and waited about 20 minutes for someone to come by so we could get our bill. The bill came and I gave him my card right away and didn't come back with my card and the bill to sign so after another 15 minutes or so I walked up to him at the register to see what was taking so long and he was all shuffled and distracted and said that he accidentally used my card for another table and charged me for their food and told me he needs to fix it and shooed me away. So I sat back down and waited another 15 min for him to come back with my card and a ton of receipts and he said sorry and ran away. I was charged for my meal and another's it shows that he voided the other meal but I know from experience that it takes several days to get that money back. I know waiting tables is stressful and hectic at times but he could have explained what happened and been  more helpful or apologetic and not rude about it."

Not memorable at all. The Thai tea wasn't wow either. Maybe because I like my Thai tea sweet. I will say, they have really good mango sticky rice and roti. Today's mango, however was not sweet at all. 2 entrees, Thai tea, and mango sticky rice with Roti was 56 bucks not including tip. Was it worth it? Not really."
