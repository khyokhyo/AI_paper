            "review": "Beautiful place, uber trendy, great drinks and amazing food located inside the Venetian hotel. We were here with a group of 13 for a birthday party. The service was great, although we had reservations we still had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated. I think everyone loved their food. It is a bit pricey but its such a great spot. I got a couple of tempura dishes (sweet potatoe and avocado) and some type of chicken dish. My husband tried sushi and something else and we are both a fan. It turns into a club upstairs at night and it's free to get in as long as you get your hand stamped. However, you still have to go back outside and wait in line again to go into the club. The club was too crowded, loud, and had a much younger crowd that what I would have liked so we didn't enjoy the club portion but the restaurant is a must do!"

If you make reservations, especially on a Fri or Sat. it is a 50/50 chance you will get sat on time. We had to wait 45 min over our due time. And we weren't the only ones they did this too. They didn't even offer to comp an appetizer or anything. Put a DJ and lounge area in a PF Changs and Id go there instead 100 out of 100 times. This is a place to try once and that is it. unless you are into bad service and being ripped off on dinner prices. Atmosphere an A+"

Sided with some edamame, I can say I left with a full stomach and didn't break the bank.\n\nAs for the drinks, the bartenders poured all vodka with a splash of water which was fine with me.  If you're going to be paying Vegas prices, you mine as well be getting your money's worth.\n\nDefinitely coming back not just for the scene but for the food as well."

            "review": "The WORST restaurant I have EVER been to- food wise (which is the most important thing). The venue was gorgeous, and we got amazing seating looking over the aesthetically brilliant decor. BUT THE FOOD WAS REVOLTING. I can get better Chinese take out in ARIZONA. (Oh yes, I've been there and their Panda Express kicks ass compared to this poop hole). It was the blandest, grossest, coldest, and most depressing meal I've ever had. The only good thing I can say about this place is that their lounge makes sick drinks (kudos to the Tao Love Potion concoction!) and their bartenders are really nice. Other than this their bouncer need a freakin reality check. You're a bouncer. You prob got let out of prison 3 months ago and it's only a matter of time until you go back. I'm dropping 200+ on dinner so do me a favor and check with  your manager before you tell me that I have to wait in line to get into your club which was also one of the WORST I have been to in Vegas. If this is your best meal the only place you've been dining at is McDonalds."

Haven't had a dish that I didn't like.  The wait staff is very professional, very knowledgeable from apps to dessert, cocktails to the wine list.  The evening that we were there, they offered a 3 course pre-pix menu for $55/person, with quite a few selections for each course.  The portions were plenty and the taste even more outstanding.  What we did was to get everything on the menu so we can share all the dishes.\n\nCocktails:\nTAO-hito, TAO's version of the classic Mojito with Bacardi Limon Rum\nLychee Martini, Belvedere, Triple Sec and Fresh Lychee Puree \nMango Tamarind Martini, Finlandia Mango Vodka, Cranberry Juice and Tamarind\nOrient Express, Stolichnaya Vanilla Vodka, Kahlua and Chilled Espresso\n\nWines:  \nShiraz, Hope Estates 2007, Hunter Valley, Australia\n\nAppetizers:\nSatay of Chicken with Peanut Sauce - Chicken cooked just right.  Peanut sauce so tasty.\n\nSpicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice Cakes - Tartare just seasoned perfectly.  I could have had two of these... that good!\n\nCrispy Thai Shrimp with Spicy Pineapple Sauce - Shrimps were huge!  Spice just right.\n\nEntrees:\nWasabi Crusted Filet Mignon with Tempura of Onion Rings - Wasabi crust not too overwhelming as Wasabi can be.  Filet cooked at medium with just the right pink to the meat.\n\nPad Thai Noodles - Best Pad Thai ever....\n\nSoy Ginger Glazed Salmon with Udon Noodles and Spinach - Salmon cooked medium, noodles flavorful. \n\nSide Dishes:  \nVegetable Fried Rice\nSpicy Hoi Yin Eggplant\n\nDesserts:\nChocolate Spring Rolls w/Kalamansi Dipping Sauce - OMG Delish!!!\n\nCrispy Fuji Apple Blossoms serviced with Tahitian Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - OMG Delish!!!\nAssorted Ice Creams and Sorbets with Almond Sesame Cookies - OMG Delish!!!\n\n\nOVERALL EXPERIENCE:\nFood:  Made sure you bring a big appetite.  The dishes don't skip on portion control.\n\nService:  Outstanding.\n\nD\u00e9cor:  Very Asian with a ZEN like feel.  Bring you camera for some great photo opts.  You know us Asian just love to take pictures!\n\nPrice:  Can be pricey, but wouldn't you just want to dine at a place with a ZEN like atmosphere and enjoy your food with calm....\n\nAfter dinner, the restaurant turns into a nightclub, so enjoy the rest of your evening drinking and dancing.  What a way to end the evening!\n\nHighly Recommend!\n\nEnjoy!"

            "review": "The first time I came was about 4 years ago for a comp dinner with a few friends. I don't remember the food exactly, but I so remember myself saying that I would have been upset if I had paid for my meal. \n\nFast forward 4 years to October 24, 2013. I was invited to dinner for someone's \"birthday.\" I wasn't too thrilled it was being celebrated here since I don't remember having an awesome experience before. Restaurant is a bit cramped, but they do cater to very large parties. I wasn't too bothered by the lighting being dark, but I could see how it would bother other people who actually want to see their food. As for the noise level, it's located in a club, so expect it to be above normal. None of this really bothered me, it's the actual food that gets to me.\n\nIf I'm going to dish out $$$ for food, it better be spectacular. And Tao did not deliver. I ordered the sizzling rice with Peking duck. For the price I paid, I could have just made that myself. I also got to sample the other dishes my friends ordered, and I was not impressed by any of them. The highlight of the night was the dessert platter which I thought was yummy. There are so many other good places to eat in Vegas for way less money. I know for sure I won't be back."

Bartenders were very quick and fun!\n\nI reserved there 21st Birthday Package which included free entry for up to 15, free drink tickets for each of your guest, VIP entry and a photo in front of there red carpet. AGAIN, all of there staff including security were so friendly! While we did not reserve a table the one guard let our older party guests sit while the place was not as crowded.\n\nAfter 11:15 the place really started to get packed. Lots of air conditioning and fans which was cooling, pun intended. A fun and \"pumpin\" DJ. However, the dancefloor was so busy that random people spilled drinks all over me. \n\nNot a fan of the half naked women standing on raised tables and shaking there butts. Gave the impression that it is okay to treat women and sexualized objects. I was indeed grabbed and felt objectified. It was my first and probably my last club. The excessive flashing lights did not help. If touchy men (and/or women) are going to be getting close to me I want my vision to be adjusted so I can see what's going on. \n\nHowever, for those who enjoy the LAAARGE club feel- this is for you. TAO staff will make it worth your wild"

I make no apologies for the movie reference - those who get it know who you are LOL! \n\nOk the food - we started with chicken lollipops (cooked to perfect tenderness yet the skin was crispy and covered in this amazing aromatic Chinese 5 spice sauce), pork bao buns (steamed then pan fried - honestly I could've done without the fry, it was too greasy for me - more steam!), and hot&sour soup (great flavor with all the fix'ns of mushrooms and bamboo shoots, but no egg and the broth was more glutinous than rich broth - too much cornstarch chef!), finally a sushi roll (I don't remember the name, but it wasn't WOW - the sushi roll menu wasn't impressive. If you want raw fish just order from the sashimi section skip the rolls; the fish was still high quality). \n\nDinner consisted of Signapore Mei Fun noodles (perfect portion for sharing and bursting with flavor), chili chicken (a savory dish of plump bite size chicken breast breaded and sauced up! Not too hot but enough kick!), and grilled ahi tuna (as expected, rare, but I think the grill was too hot or it cooked too long because the edging seemed thicker and dried out instead of thin and flaky; still fresh and good flavors from the sauce n veggies). \n\nUnfortunately, I was too full for dessert, but I look forward to going back because there was more to explore on the menu!"

Not only was the food OUT OF THIS WORLD, but what was 10 million times better was our service. Literally THE best server I have ever had in my entire life was Jeffery. He was SO NICE, no on EVERYTHING, so helpful. We were all honestly in SHOCK of this guy because he was that good, and we had a huge party. None of us have had service like that in a LONG LONG time.

            "review": "I ate here at the bar with my sis-in-law since we were going to the club afterward. It turned out to be a great idea, not only for the convenience of being downstairs from the club, but also because the food was pretty good and the atmosphere was very fun. The decor was awesome and the layout of the bar/lounge was cool, except it gets really crowded before the club opens. Our bartender was on top of everything the entire time (except for one thing that I'll get to at the end for emphasis) and our food came at a reasonable pace. The sushi here is about average based on what we got. Some yellowtail sashimi and a special roll. Tasty, decent portions, the usual. I have loved this place ever since for two reasons: the sake menu is extensive and the kobe beef carpachio is incredible! It's the best I've ever had and I've been craving it ever since! We had a great time at the bar and had some good food for the price... it didn't seem all that expensive to me for what we got. All in all, a great start to the night. \n\nNow here's the one thing that the bartender dropped the ball on and remember this if you eat there before the club:\n\nTurns out you have to get a stamp from your server to get in upstairs. Even if you have a freakin receipt for $200 at that very place! So back to the bartender we go, then she says go to the front because she was busy I think. By then the front is getting slammed with bodies all wanting to get into the club so talking to the folks at the front was near impossible, not to mention maneuvering through the masses. So FINALLY after badgering the people at the front, and some nifty work by my sister getting in with another crowd already lined up for the stamp guy, we got em and were good to go. That's a whole 'lotta nonsense for a stamp I know and just remember to get yours when you pay for your meal. Lucky I didn't give 'em three stars for that cluster f#@$!"

            "review": "I really liked the decor. Fresh rose petals, buddhas, candlelights, dim, very romantic. We had the soft shell crab roll, shrimp tempura roll, and dragon roll with eels. They were all better than average, though a bit small - not unexpected.Kids wanted the lobster wonton soup and shrimp tempura. The soup was better than the tempura - too thick and oily. We tried the duck spring roll, it was pretty good, don't mind ordering again. The eight of us shared the kobe beef with scallons, XO shrimp,Pad thai,lo mein, kung pao chicken, assorted sashimi, and the lobster dish that I totally hate my friend for ordering .... just kidding about the hate part.....  Every entree was very salty, and the worst part was it tasted like the same sauce was used for every dish. with all the food we ordered and consumed, I actually still had room for dessert, I must say this is probably the best part of the meal. The chocolate parfait with Godiva liquer was nice, balances out the saltiness lingering in my mouth. Tried hubby's lychee sorbet - refreshing, kid's mousse fortune cookie, so-so, but they found it amusing. I actually could eat more, the portions were just too small. we did not see Paris Hilton, but did see Robin Leach with a couple young blonds. :)"

            "review": "My wife and I had dinner here with friends on Saturday night and came away a bit underwhelmed.\n\nBy no means was the food bad, it very tasty, mostly what soured my view of the establishment was the overly loud music. I realize it converts to a club at night, however not being able to hear someone across the table unless they speak loudly and I lean in does not make for an enjoyable dining experience.\n\nI was also a bit disappointed that I was steered away from ordering the orange chicken by my waitress. I don't consider myself someone who enjoys very spicy food, and when I ordered it our waitress asked if I liked my food spicy. I explained I do like some spice, but not large amounts of it. She then told me I might be better off ordering something else. Not wanting to ruin dinner with friends by not eating my meal I opted to order the filet mignon with udon noodles. While I enjoyed the flavor of the filet with udon I was disappointed in two regards. Firstly the amount of filet mignon with the noodles was pitiful, I had maybe 3 oz of meat total in my meal I think. Secondly, the sauce with udon noodles was tossed in was pretty average, I think I've had the same sauce in a meal at Noodles & Co.  To top it off, my friend ordered the orange chicken despite our waitress' warning and found that it wasn't nearly as spicy as the waitress made it out to be.\n\nDespite hearing how great some of the desserts here were, we decided to skip it and go elsewhere so that we could actually hold a conversation without shouting."

            "review": "It kills me to write this review. This is maybe the most disappointing dining experience I've ever had in Las Vegas. I brought a group of 11 here last Thursday night. Our waiter's name was Bobby. He strongly suggested a pre-fixe menu due to the size of our party - it would come with appetizers, main dishes and dessert for $60 a person (pre-fixe means we have no choice in what gets brought to out table, FYI).\n\nSo after we agree to the dinner, the appetizers made it out in about 20 minutes; and honestly, they were great. Fried pork buns, spring rolls, short ribs, some kind of seafood dumplings and three rolls of sushi. Our table of 11 seemed satisfied with the amount of food we received for the first course. Also, I thought all of it was delicious. \n\nUnfortunately, this is where our fun ended. About an hour later, our waiter comes to our table for the FIRST time since our appetizers were dropped off and asked if we were ready for dessert. We said, \"Ummm, we'd like our dinner first!\". He acted shocked that we hadn't eaten yet. He left, came back a minute later and said that all of our food was delivered to another table accidentally and that he'd have a new round of food brought to us very quickly, maybe 10 minutes. Well, 20 minutes later, we started to get upset. I told Bobby that we had been waiting too long for our dinner. He tried to claim we had only been waiting 45 minutes, including the mistake. But I disagreed and he got a little upset with me. He told our table 3 minutes and our food would be out. So we waited. Again. Ten more minutes went by and I walked over to an assistant manager and asked him to please get our bill right away because we were leaving. I said we'd be happy to pay for our drinks and all the appetizers. He said that was fine. Moments later the food finally came out. But it was too late.Almost 90 minutes had passed and four people had left our party. \n\nTwo minutes later, Bobby comes back to the table and announces that dessert is on the way - mind you, we didn't get any dinner. I told him to talk with his manager - we had already agreed to pay for what we consumed and we wanted to leave. He got more and more visibly upset with me and our group - he was also having words with the assistant manager after I demanded the bill.\n\nWe finally got the bill and it was $327 and change. For appetizers and about 13 drinks. We tipped %15 percent, even though our service was awful; and he never gave a true apology for screwing up our dinner. \n\nWhat stinks, is that I was the reason my group went to dinner here! I convinced them to go - and we all had an awful experience. Even worse, literally no one from the restaurant seemed to care in the least. Seriously, even the assistant manager admitted it was a long time to wait for dinner, yet after being there for a total of 2 hours, they didn't even comp the drinks. \n\nNeedless to say, I will never go there again. And 10 other people will never go again either. Its a good thing Las Vegas has so many awesome places to dine. And for that reason, you should avoid this establishment!!!"

Tao has really taught me a lesson in that department. Don't judge until you've tried. \n\nI've come to Tao two times to eat and both times my socks have been blown off. Not really...cos both times I wore heels that were way too high and uncomfortable and ended the night walking around without shoes. Note to self: DO NOT wear ridiculous shoes when you intend to walk more than 3 steps. \n\nI digress...I digress...back to Tao. Contrary to popular belief, both times I was here (once with 8 people and once with 4), we were able to get tables (the first time we called the night before and the next time we just walked in) on Saturday nights. As you enter Tao, there are these flower-petal filled mini earthen bath tubs...haha...if I had a couple of their super strong lychee martinis I would go take plonk myself in one of these. They look that zen and inviting. \n\nThis latest visit I made to Tao started with drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. Lychee Martinis...I made sure to ask for \"extra strong\" martinis and that was delivered. A great start to the night. The waiter we had was very knowledgeable about the food. He knew exactly what went in each dish. Tao is also very vegetarian friendly. They can substitute tofu in many dishes and there are many veggie options. Ok now to the dishes:\n\n1. Shishito Peppers - Yum Yum...very nice and interesting. Never had these before. I probably wouldn't order these if I didn't have more than 4 people in my party. Rather large portion and the taste is interesting only the first couple of bites\n\n2. Sake Infused Mushrooms - OK I am going to go insane right now. This was soooo good....i HATE sake and I'm salivating all over my laptop right now. I can't even describe this dish. You just need to get it. NEED TO I tell you\n\n3. Steamed Veggie Dumplings - The dumplings itself were pretty normal. Nothing out of the regular dumpling world. Don't get me wrong, they were good...just nothing to write a paragraph about (although I guess I already have). Now, the dumplings came with this AMAZING crunchy cucumber side. Ok...seriously...cooked cucumbers. Sounds icky but Yum Yum Yum. Very very nice...\n\n4. Fried Brown Rice with Veggies - Wow. Crispy lettuce, perfectly cooked tofu, simple flavors and you wouldn't even know you are eating brown rice (I don't like brown rice). Tastes sooo good. This is literally the best fried rice I've had outside of Asia. And I've eaten many a fried rice\n\n5. Mango Tamarind Martini - This one tasted sooooo good. Masked the taste of alcohol (i can't stand the taste of alcohol) and tasted interesting with just a hint of tamarind. A perfect complement to the meal. The drink still packed a good punch even though you couldn't taste the \"punch.\"\n\nWe ended the meal with the 4 of us sharing a chocolate cake of some sort. I'm not a fan of chocolate cakes in general so I can't really remember how it tasted. The girls seemed to like it though. \n\nWe even got our hands stamped to get into Tao (the club area) after we ate. Totally worth the price!\n\nIf you are in Vegas and up for a nice dinner on the strip I would suggest Tao for sure. Great food, amazing drinks, good service and the ambiance is of course wonderful."

The place is always busy and after dinner if you plan to dance the night away- Tao club is a fun one too- though it gets crowded and hard to move, which gave me a claustrophobic feeling- but still fun.

From the rose-pedal baths to the giant Buddha and wall of antique opium pipes, the whole place just feels like a place you'd want to be seen in.\nAs far as sushi goes, the rolls left a lot to be desired, especially at the prices they were fetching for them.  At 30 dollars for their most expensive roll, I would have expected a little more.  However, the nigiri was pretty good, and they had some of the best toro (fatty tuna) I think I've ever had.  Then again, I've never really met a piece of toro I didn't like.  \nSo, it would be a cool place to go, but not the best sushi I've ever had.  Definitely a place to see and be seen, so dress accordingly."

The host made us wait and said \"I'll see what I can do\" when we said we didn't have a reservation, giving us the impression that they might be booked. Inside, there were enough tables to make my girlfriend and I roll our eyes. \n\n The Good: The drinks were amazing. We had the Tiger Lilly and the Black Pearl. The desert was also amazing (molten chocolate cake with coconut ice cream).  My girlfriend really liked the spicy smoked salmon roll. We thought the jalape\u00f1o yellowtail was decent. The decor is really pretty. \n\n The bad: The bus staff rushed around us and passed things over our head unsteadily. It makes it hard to relax when you worry that your girlfriend is going to get trampled because she's near a service entrance. The waiter was nice, but paced the meal poorly, so we spent a lot of time just waiting after we finished our jalape\u00f1o yellowtail. The music was also very loud and made it hard for us to hear each other or the waiter.\n\nThe ugly: The sushi wasn't fresh. The wild yellowtail, the white tuna and the hawaiian snapper were all virtually indistinguishable because they shared a common tinge of whatever coolers they were in. The soft shell crab roll was pretty tasteless and the sauce didn't add anything other than moisture to a dry roll. \n\n  My tiny girlfriend was hungry again after a couple of hours in the casino and we ended up going for another meal, so was that $130+tip we spent at Tao worth it?"

We wanted to try out tao because we were with a couple of dudes and knew we could get into the club without paying for a cover for the guys if we ate dinner there.\n\nJust FYI, you must get an entree which does not include most of the sushi, soups, etc. if you want free access to the club. I kinda think the rule is crap because I wanted a miso soup and sushi roll and was planning on ordering multiple drinks but was told that it didn't qualify as an entree selection. SO I ended up getting something I didn't want as much and ordered less drinks. I really couldn't win here. My recommendation would be spending an amount per person or per table, but I am not an expert. \n\nWe ordered edamame and tempura shrimp and sweet potato as appetizers. Edamame was SUPER spicy, but I am into that sorta thing so it was good. The tempura was average.For my entree I ordered some special sushi roll with tuna or salmon on top, don't remember. If you couldn't tell the sushi roll was very unmemorable to me. It was average sushi that comes with an AYCE joint. However, this suchi roll was $32! My husband got the lobster pad thai which was presented great, but taste was again average to me. \n\nThe highlight of the night was the giant fortune cookie desert that they bring out for celebrations. It was very tasty and great to share. \n\nBottom Line: Probably won't be back if it is my job to choose a place, but the food was edible, in a beautiful location, with friendly servers."

Full of bold flavour and can easily make you want more! This sea bass is so flaky and since its done right succulent as well. If you've never been into seafood this dish will definitely make you a believer that yes those swimmers in the deep blue are definitely worth snatching up and being prepared under Tao Bistros watchful eye.\n\nGet It!\n\nChinese Sausage Fried Rice:\n\nI was a little wary of this dish just because Chinese sausage has always kind of put me off. Why I guess it's always been a little funky but whatever I figured since it was so highly recommended we'd give it a shot. Topped off with a fried egg we mixed our little rice dish together and well it was simply delicious. The rice for me was a little overcooked but with the flavors that were put in place to make this little side dish so stunning I looked passed it easily. Once again Tao bistro serves up full blown flavour with this dish. \n\nTao Bistro definitely stands by that go big or go home ideal with its choices in flavour s used in their dishes.

We were quite tired and hungry from all the walking, so all we wanted was a place to sit, relax, eat, and drink. Tao seemed like the pretty obvious choice since we were staying at The Venetian, but we were definitely wrong.\n\nWe walked into the dimly lit establishment and we were greeted by 3 individuals at the door. As if the doormen didn't scream \"pretentious\", we just had to walk in to find out more.\n\nOne of the hostesses walked us over to our table and said that the waiter would be over shortly. We waited, and waited, and waited and waited until my boyfriend looked at me with pity because I appeared to be very thirsty and no one had come to take our drink orders after 20 minutes! This is beyond ridiculous, IMO, especially when there were about 3 waiters circulating in our area. As he grabbed my hand to pull me out of there, a waitress came by (in the nick of time), to say \"oh, where are you going?\" when we proceeded to say \"we were just about to leave\" when her slew of apologies came flourishing out and we felt obliged to stay. At about 25 minutes into our stay, we finally received our glasses of water. \n\nThat night, I decided to order the chicken pad thai while my bf had the crispy orange chicken. Our waitress put a rush order in for our food and we were served in less than 15 minutes.\nPad thai- flavorless and watery. It almost felt like a pad thai soup. I thought letting it sit for a bit would cool it down and let the sauce thicken, but that didn't help\nCrispy orange chicken- it was good, but it wasn't amazing. \n\nOur waitress then decided to go on break and left us waitressless. We asked about 3 people for our bill because we had had enough, but it wasn't until 15 minutes later that we finally received our bill. My bf and I religiously tip our waiters, but this was just a downhill battle that Tao would not win. Tip? Provide better service and don't rely on the hype around your establishment to make your food taste better."

I've been to the Tao night club before but I had no idea that there was a restaurant part. \n\nThe food at this place was on point...I had the coconut breaded shrimp and my fianc\u00e9 had the wasabi crusted filet mingon. We also had a variety of tempura foods for an appetizer and I also tried one of their signature drinks, the \"Tao-tini\"-delicious! The beverage was a little pricey ($15, about standard for Vegas I suppose), but it was very well made and rather strong! I would say it's worth the money. Other than the food, the atmosphere is good and the prices are decent...however, it was a little loud and hard to hear the person next to you but other than that, everything was great! We will definitely be hitting up this place again when we are back in town!"

The lounge is a nice area to people watch as you wait for your table or if you have no reservation, you can eat there on a first come-first serve basis. We always get a plate of sushi for starters. The spicy tuna roll is good. Had the wasabi crusted filet w/ onion rings, decent. The wasabi was a different twist on things, but I think I can do without. Also previously had the miso sea bass with peking duck fried rice as a side, both were decent as well. Service has always been pretty good. \nI would reserve a table a couple of weeks in advance or you'll be dining late. I mean starting dinner at 11:30pm late. \nI've learned when you go to a trendy Asian-fusion place the food is going to be mix results. Sushi is usually good, but main dish can be a hit or miss. If you're looking at Tao then you heard about the nice decor. The vibe is Vegas/Hollywood glam, seen someone famous every time. If you dine here, you also get a line stamp for the club. You can impress your friends and said you had dinner at the highest grossing restaurant in the country, which Tao is. The place is more about the scene than the food. But worth checking out once to see what the fuss is all about."

There are lots of groups (think: bridal showers, clubbers, etc.) and the music is pumped to get the party atmosphere going. We arrived without reservations, but luckily for us, they had a few seats at the sushi bar in the back. It remained very busy the entire time we were there, so I'd recommend reservations if possible.\n\nWe ordered the veggie kung pao, which was not AT ALL like kung pao. It was more like a mild sweet and sour sauce. Oddly, the kung pao didn't come with rice, so we ordered a side of it separately. We also ordered the vegetarian udon noodles, which were fine but somehow managed to miss the spot for me. Our third dish was a hamachi sashimi dish that was to die for! They put sliced jalapenos and a ponzu sauce on it. If I went back, I could just order 3 of those and be satisfied. \n\nOverall, a decent place. Due to noise, I wouldn't suggest this as a place for a romantic dinner or business meeting (unless you weren't particularly fond of the people you're with, lol)."

It is like eating in a nightclub or lounge.  Lots of well-dressed good looking people, and relatively loud music.  This place is a scene.  But you know what?  The substance was actually there for the meal that I had.\n\nWe shared a series of small dishes and main courses and were very impressed.  The substance was actually there in the food and the service was friendly and attentive.  A nice treat considering that I was expecting the worst.\n\nFor our starters we had the shrimp with peanut sauce, XO Chinese long beans, the crispy spicy tuna roll, and the spicy eggland dish.  All of the dishes were quite good, flavorful, and had a good portion size.  The dish that really stood out here was the crispy spicy tuna roll which ranks up there with one of the best rolls I've had -- it packed a nice kick and the fish was fresh.\n\nFor the main courses, we shared the chilean sea bass, the typhoon lobster, and the wasabi crusted filet mignon.  The main courses were all delicious.  The sea bass was fantastic as was the lobster.  It was all decadent and delicious.\n\nI would come back here as the food lived up to the style of the restaurant.  Plus, you can a line pass if you eat here which allowed us to bypass the huge line into the Tao Nightclub and enter the club with no cover charge.  A nice bonus!"

The music is loud and pumping through out the restaurant but it didn't bother me at all. It could bother some older people though but it set the tone for the ambiance of the place and I personally enjoyed it.  I suggest making a reservation to the place since it is pretty busy.  The wait for our table did not take too long. We were able to grab a drink at the bar right there located in the entrance and get our barrings and enjoy what this place had to offer. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The food..amazing. I had the chilean sea bass..OMG! So good..so worth it. Boyfriend had the kobe steak topped with onions, amazing as well! Dessert was terrific.  After dinner, if you wanted to go to the nightclub all you have to do is ask your waiter and a hostess will stamp your hand to get in to the club. You still have to go outside to check your i.d. but the wait in the line is minimal.  \nSo, why the 3 star?  Well everything was GREAT except at the end of our meal when the waiter brought BACK our check to sign the total. I wasn't sure what that was about but pointed to my boyfriend to have him sign it because he was paying for it. Now, we are seated very close to the other people and the waiter yells out, \" Well when you tip me less than 10% you have to initial that's what you want.\"  People next to us were looking at us and my face just went flush! Then he walked away muttering something under his breath, I was trippin! My boyfriend had miscalculated the tip, not usually coming to a place like this and feeling a bit uncomfortable, he quickly signed the bill over and gave it to the waiter not realizing he miscalculated the tip.  Now, I understand..don't get me wrong. I was a bartender so tips are apart of your income and perhaps in a place like this, management may look at the waiters performance as a reason why his tip was so small, which clearly was not the case, he was great. But to embarrass us like that, really upset me and instead of going to the club later, we just decided to go home. So much for a romantic night. But you know, regardless of all that, I do know that Vegas thrives on money and on our way out I gave the waiter another tip because he was good, no doubt. IT was just a misunderstanding. \nAgain, I understand where the waiter was coming from but jeeze, maybe speak softer and don't walk away muttering things under your breathe making us feel like we were unwelcomed and like we did not belong. Because of this, regardless of the awesome food, we will not go back nor advise others to do so either because I believe it could have been handled better with less embarrassment for customers who spent over $200 for dinner."

The service was stellar (although I had a glass of water spill on me -- accidents happen, I get it.). The server was informative and guided my group of guys through a good culinary experience. \n\nWhy Not Five Stars?: I had the Drunken Lobster Pad Thai and felt underwhelmed with the food.  The presentation was amazing and I can't complain about the large helping of lobster but it was watered-down. The level of spice was poor and had me thinking that I should of stated extra spicy. \n\nRefer to Friend?: I would. However, one of the most important reasons of dining at TAO during MDW is the ability to enjoy the nightlife aspect of TAO right after dining (free and speedy access into the club section if each one of the party members orders an entr\u00e9e from the dinner menu). To my dismay, this dining benefit was not honored. To TAO's credit, DJ \"Bless Up, I'm Up To Something, I like that, We The Best EPIC, Cloth Alert, New Deal Alert\" Kaled was going to be hosting. It just would of been great if TAO explained the \"Dining First\" option would not be honored when I made reservations."

The food quality and preparation was not on par with another shi-shi Asian fusion restaurant/club I'd been to recently, Buddakan in NYC.\n\nI didn't see any stars eating in there, although I've been told this is the place to go for a celeb sighting.  We did go there awfully early though.  Maybe the celebs were still sleeping off their hangovers.  Anyway, most of the celebs we saw were either sunbathing or playing blackjack.  Who knew?"

There were 5 us celebrating my friend's 30th birthday, and our server was energetic, passionate, and delivered a great experience. His manager was also phenomenal, and ended up comp'ing us with a second bottle of Perrier-Jouet champagne after he mispoured a glass. \n\nOur server (I can't remember his name) told us that $50 per person would be more than enough to get everything we wanted, and he was right about that. All in all, he brought out three courses - two rounds of appetizers and tasting plates, and one round of entrees. It felt like we tried everything on the menu, and were so stuffed by the third round. Highlights included:\n\n- Satay of Chilean sea bass with asparagus - honestly, out of this world. Melt in your mouth, incredibly flavourful. \n\n- Spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice\n\n- Crispy spicy tuna roll with avocado and soy paper - probably the best sushi I've ever tasted\n\n- Lobster wontons with shiitake ginger broth - every bite was an explosion of delicious flavour\n\nIn addition to the wonderful food and service, Tao also has a great atmosphere - beautiful decor, good music, very trendy and sleek, filled with beautiful people. Bonus is that you get free entry to Tao nightclub after dinner, though we didn't find it that great (it was crowded and not fun). \n\nWould highly recommend Tao for dinner!"

From the sweet potatoes, to the onion rings, to the Pad Thai.  Everything was just amazing.  Our server was excellent.  He was friendly without being annoying.  I told the server that I was a Concierge and that I worked for an elite company (the name of which I can't say here because I'll get FIRED!!!)  and he brought out a complimentary fortune cookie.  I'm not talking about those little shits you get from the takeout place up the road.  This was a massive, probably 5 pound fortune cookie with one side filled with chocolate mousse and the other filled with white chocolate.  Covered in fresh, tropical fruit, it was absolutely stunning to look at and even better to devour.  Entering the bathroom, it's sort of hard to tell which one is for you as they are only labeled with \"Yin\" and \"Yang.\"  Which one am I? Yin or Yang?  Omg omg omg.  A brief panic attack hit me as I feared entering the wrong gender bathroom in the hippest restaurant in Las Vegas.  Luckily, some slutty looking chicks went into one of the bathrooms (can't remember if it was yin or yang) and so I went into the opposite one.  Inside, a convenience store was waiting.  This is not a joke.  Every type of gum, breath mint/spray/strip, and designer cologne you could imagine was just sitting there.  Like 10 grand worth of Burberry just laying around.   Heaven! Except there wasn't an overly friendly Indian man working in there.  So, not a TRUE convenience store, but I'm confident that Tao will complete the theme sometime in the near future.  Anyway, Tao is even on opentable, so I really can't even find one, single flaw with the whole place.  If you're in Vegas, go there!  (If you're hot/cool/trendy/rich enough.... you fucking loser.)"

I wanted to go to the freaking noodle bar at the hotel because I was kinda grumpy but she insisted. There was this long wait for the night club upstairs but we told the hostess that we were there to eat but we got this weird look as if we were cutting the club line which I tried to ignore.  The main dude- kinda heavy set with a flat top says \"Hi, you guys got reservations?\"  That really pisses me off, calling my hot girlfriend a guy.  No...we didn't have reservations.  So...I take the little plastic buzzer and he says it will take 30-45 mins.  I decide to order some dranks as the bar.  When I go up for the second round at the bar for drinks, the chicka dees at the bar are all gawking at how cool my mustache is.  Two douchers walk up behind me, one has total respect for the stache and the other must have had too much to drink because he got in my bubble when I was trying to order my drinks.  The bar tender came by and he started talking and i grabbed that pencil neck and threw him over my shoulder behind me.  So....the wait for the table.  4 jack and cokes in....we get our table and I had to relieve myself.  I go to the bathroom and come to our table...very dark..very loud..trying to be patient because there is a night club upstairs.  So...I'm a little drunk and then our little too cool for school waiter comes up with the dumb a** blow out hair cut comes up and starts his spiel..saying what we \"Have to order\"  to go to the night club menue...bro...broham...we don't want to go to the night club.  We just want to eat.  So....I say right off the bat..Could we please get two waters?  He points to our table and says  \"There's two waters right there.\"  His tone, his attitude, etc. made me have a Viet Nam Flash back.  Like I said, the joint was dark and loud, I didn't see the two waters and plus I went to the bathroom.  Talk about wanting to chokeslam a doucher for attempting to embarrass me in front of my girlfriend.  This turd needed to be flushed down the drain.  I ordered a pretty extensive order and got up and left.  Bro....Broham...you're a waiter for a reason because you suck at life.  How ever if that's what you choose to do....have some common sense and learn how to take an order.  If I say two more waters, shut your stupid mouth and bring me two more waters.  You were lucky I was in a good mood.  \n\nSo we finally end up going to the the noodle bar at the and it was the shizzzzzznitttt.  The service was fantastic and the food was great.  I love you.  And bring me my two waters next time."

So, when we ordered the shrimp which was $8, we expected there to be at least enough shrimp for the eight of us. however, when the waiter brought out our order, it consisted of two shrimps on a tiny platter. They weren't even prawns, they were those small tiger shrimps that you can buy in bulk at your local asian store for $8 a pack! Ridiculous! We expected at least four pieces of good sized shrimp but for a tiny cocktail shrimp?? No, that was a waste of our 8 bucks.  Lastly, my favorite has to be the eggrolls.

I had the shrimp tempura which was made with large, meaty prawns.  We split the pork dumplings, which we both praised.\nWe shared the orange chicken as an entree.  We also ordered a side of rice, which was perfect because the entree also came with rice.  The chicken was excellent and served with that green Chinese vegetable I like and always forget to look for at the grocery store.  We both agreed that the dish was sweet- it would be perfect with another spicy dish to balance it.\nLoved the 20 foot Buddha and the opium pipe wall.  Hated the meditating Buddha heads on the wall behind the host desk- it looked like body parts.  We also didn't quite get the large bathtub type objects filled with rose petals in the entrance.  I am guessing it's a nod to offerings to Buddha.\nIf you are thinking about trying this place, go.  There is a reason it's the highest grossing restaurant in the country.

We also got several piecess of salmon, tuna and yellowtail sashimi. In the past they would have brought us one big tray with all of this sushi as well as lemon, cucumber and other extras that drastically change the flavor of the sushi in a good way. This time it was quickly thrown on a small plate and it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.\n\nI ended going again because some other friends had just gotten in town and wanted to try it out. Once again I was disappointed. The sashimi was still way over priced. We go the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos and ponzu and it was good but not $20 good for 4 small (really small) pieces. The sea bass was good but not good enough to out weigh the negatives.\n\nThe atmosphere is still fun but it is slightly louder then I remember. You can tell that the place is going downhill in popularity as well since there were over 50% of the tables were empty on a Friday night at 9:00."

So yes, this place is good but I had better Asian food at many other places. I would only go back here to eat so then i can just go to the club without waiting on line. It seems like everyone says \"you have to go to TAO\" to eat if you are in Vegas. Not sure why as they are prob many other better places to eat. It's a fun place, so you can enjoy the food and have a good time but to me its more of a place to be seen rather then eat great quality food. Well at least I got it out of the way to go eat here so I don't have to go back. You are not paying for the food here because if you were then you be getting ripped off big time, you are paying for the scene and the name."

We had a 10:30 pm reservation and ended up after 3 trips to the hostess station getting seated at 11:15 at a table that wasn't set up yet. Then after speaking to a manager got seated at another table. Let's start off between me and the other 3 people sitting at the table, we have a combined restaurant fine dinning experience and working in the industry over 70 years. From a Food Beverage Director of a hotel casino to restauranteur and founder of the most successful night clubs in Miami. That said I'm not f@&)ing around here. \n\nThe food was at the most a 6 from 1 to 10. The service though was pretty good and hospitable. But really pisses me off. When you sell your own filtered water that still tastes just like out if a fountain gun for $8. Specify on the menu that it's not bottled water. If wanted some Aquafina or Dassani I could had went downstairs at get for free from the casino host. Let me tell you. You have lost me and my thousand of  followers that ask me. \"Where I should go out tonight\". \n\nNow to top it off to have a girl In a tub covered in rose petals and lighted candles  In the  front entrance as a decor at 1 AM in the morning. Is probably the most degreating thing I have ever seen.\n\nTo top it off. Holly shit !!!! The crowd that night after the Floyd Mayweather fight. They will let anyone in there. It looked like Miami Beach Memorial Day Weekend, or a episode of Hard Core Pawn. \n\nWell enough said. They figure it's Vegas and million of people just stroll in no matter what."

The prix fixe menu looked amazing so we ordered that to share after the waiter recommended sharing the dishes family style. We were told that the prix fixe menu couldn't be shared. My husband protested because you should be able to do what you want with the food you order and because the restaurant would be making more money than if we just split 1 dish, which would have been the alternative. Our waiter took it up with the manager who allowed us to share, which was a plus. However the quality of service we received from our waiter quickly deteriorated after that. We got more service from the waiter serving the table next to us.\n\nThe food wasn't spectacular either. Having had many experiences with Americanized Asian food, I can say that the PF Changs meals you buy frozen in a bag are better than Tao. The filet was drowned in a sticky, sweet sauce and didn't taste like filet. The chocolate egg roll had way too much chocolate.\n\nIf you want to experience one of the Tao Group's restaurants, I highly reommend Lavo because Tao doesn't live up to its hype."

Arrived on time for our reservation and were seated immediately, with a late request to sit near the buddha.\n\nService was decent.  We had to fill our wines a few times, didn't try any of the cocktails.  The wine list is fairly extensive with many options from relatively cheap (Vegas standards) to high end stuff.  (wines by the glass, not so extensive)  I ordered the pepper steak w/ udon noodles.  It was nice, although I expected more pepper for a pepper steak.  The noodles were done well and the sauce was tasty.  Overall, it was a nice dish, the problem was it's not worth the $30 they charge.  I get that this is Vegas, but there are better restaurants for that price within the Venetian.\n\nAmbience was cool, the buddha is big, the bathrooms say yin and yang, so I walked into the wrong bathroom not knowing yin means women in some kind of Asian language.  I like the electronica playing and it was never overly loud, although we were there early.\n\nThe fortune cookies are very wise as well.  Mine read like this, \"Sex is the most beautiful, natural, and wholesome thing that money can buy.\"  I should give them four stars just for the fortune.\n\nThere are better options for food, but if you want a hipster joint with decent food, this may be your spot."

The ambiance is very dark and sexy- candle lights and rose pedals floating in tubs of water. The service was great. It seems they have a large staff and are ready for large crowds. This is a great place to eat alone, with a friend or in a large group. The food was good but not spectacular. I ordered a rare Ahi tuna with spinach and it was very salty. The sushi rolls and Salmon specialty with avocado were great. Reservations are recommended, every time I visit this place is packed."

            "review": "I wish there was a way to give it a negative number of stars.  I have been to the Tao NY location and loved their giant fortune cookie dessert!  I can't tell you that the food itself or drinks were memorable but I did want to check out the Vegas location so I made a reservation.\n\nBoy, did I make a mistake. My friends and I arrive right on time and are told that even w/ reservations, everyone waits 30 mins.  So we asked them how long we would have waited if we didn't have reservations.  Apparentlly, they didn't have our reservations although I had made the reservations w/ them directly that day.  Strike one from the host who was the rudest man on earth.  He must have taken too many \"cool pills\" since he had something up his ass!\n\nThen, while we wait for our reservations they screwed up at the bar, my friends and I are given a cocktail menu that we ordered off of.  We ordered one round of drinks that clearly stated that it should have been about $30 + tip for drinks.  We get the bill and it says $60.  When I point the mistake out to the server (while clearly showing her the menu we were given), she is so dumb that she mentions that we also got a Diet Coke in addition to our 4 drinks!  So the Diet Coke accounts for the $30 difference?  What a moran!  When I asked her to bring out the manager as she clearly did not have one brain cell, the  server started giving me an attitude.  After a 10 min. wait for the \"manager\", I was told that they had given us the wrong menu w/ incorrect prices.  Apparently, the bill was supposed to be $60 although the menu THEY gave us said it was supposed to be $7 each.  We were not given an apology for the mistake or anything!  \n\nBecause I have worked at a restaurant and currently work in advertising, I know that good customer service would have included an apology for THEIR mistake and then an offer to honor the lower price.  No such thing was done so I demanded a talk w/ the manager.   \n\nOnly after I bitched out the manager did she apologize for the mistake and correct the bill for our 1 round of $30 drinks!  This after making us deal w/ this and completely ruin a fun night out!  After such horrible service, we were told our table was ready (as if we were LUCKY to be given our table 40 mins after our reservation time!).  We told them that we would not be dining there.  We didn't want to give this establishment any of our money!\n\nWe gave them a piece of our mind and walked out w/ the glasses in hand! \n\nThis pompousness and outright HORRIBLE customer service ruined our evening.  We ended up eating at the casual Asian restaurant in the venetian as we were so hungry by this time that we couldn't wait to try to find another \"trendy place\".  It turned out to be a good decision as the food was good and we got great service!  The best part, we ended up spending probably 1/6th what we would have spent at Tao.  I would have paid for a great meal, great service at Tao but the point that they would not quickly resolve the issue from THEIR mistake made me furious!  \n\nTao, get your act together!  If you went to a store and they clearly had the wrong price marked on a sweater or in their ad, they should honor the lower price.  Same goes for the menu you gave us!  I will NEVER go to this location again!"

            "review": "I went to Tao for the 2nd time tonight for dinner.  The last time I went I had some sort of a Groupon or something, and tonight my friend had a gift card she was given as a gift.  I think that's the only way I would dine here.  I think the food is overpriced, and if you're going to spend this much on a meal, there's other places in town I'd rather go.  Maybe it's just me.\n\nWe started with two appetizers... the spicy tune tartare on crispy rice and the lobster wontons with shiitake ginger broth.  We had the tartare last time and really enjoyed it.  We enjoyed it again this time, but it wasn't as magical as it was last time.  The lobster wontons... well, they tasted like the best wontons I've ever eaten, but I could barely taste the lobster.  The flavor was drowned out from the broth, I thought.\n\nFor a main course, we split the most expensive omakase sushi menu, which was like $58.  Very underwhelming how little food we got: one roll, 7 pieces of nigiri, and 6 slices of sashimi.  Granted, one of the nigiri was toro, and the roll was a lobster roll of some sort, but for $58, I'd expect a little more.  Throw some salmon nigiri in there!\n\nWe also split the coconut crusted shrimp with peanut sauce, which was really delicious, though the breading on the shrimp was too thick.  That was made up for in quantity of shrimp, as I think there were like 8 or so large shrimp.  It also came with a side of rice, and some sort of salad in the middle of the plate.\n\nLastly, we tried the avocado tempura since we both love avocado.  Very tasty.\n\nWe stuck with water, and when our bill came, it was $140 after tax.  We did have a lot of food, but that seems like way too much to pay for a meal at a place like Tao.  The service was top notch, and the ambiance is typical loud music, dark vibe that you'd expect in Vegas.  So 4 stars for me."

The food here was no better than your average Pei Wei/PF Changs. $13/a small bowl (less than 2 cups) of vegetable rice is outrageous. We ordered scallops, Sea Bass $39, Orange chicken $28, and coconut shrimp for 4 of us. My husband and I had green tea and the other couple had one drink each. The Sea Bass and the shrimp were the better of the four dishes, in my opinion. The scallops were large, there were 4. They were soaked in a curry sauce, which I did not care for. The service was just o k, although the server said one dish of rice would be plenty, but after each one of us had 2-3 tablespoons, another dish was ordered (another $13)f The bill was probably $230 including tip.\n\nThe worst of all was the noise level. There were bunches of girls in short dresses with 6 inch heels scampering upstairs to the nightclub at $60 a head. The noise, oh the noise! We had to sit in silence while eating because the music level and the bass was so incredibly deafening, we could not hear anything but bass.  By the time we were done with dinner, I had a horrible headache. \n\nIf you don't need to worry about how much you spend, and you like very trendy, loud restaurants with mediocre food and naked girls in bathtubs, then this place is for you!"

It's a bit loud, but dimly lit and always packed with ppl.\n\n4 stars because the Gyoza, chicken and dessert were tasty and would go back for it. Plus, lots of potentially good looking dishes I saw (fried rice, pad Thai, chicken skewers and more)\n\nThe food (ps the highlight was the cauliflower omg)\n- CHICKEN GYOZA (3.5 stars): choice of steamed or fried, wrongly opted for the steamed - mushy exterior but a tasty filling and soy dipping sauce. Served with pretty much raw bean sprouts.\n- CRISPY TUNA ROLL (2 stars): fresh fish, but overly heavy handed on the wasabi and ginger. Tasted a little too oily for me as well. Served on a bed of ton of edamame with grated ginger\n- CHILEAN SEABASS (3 stars): very flavorful, very fresh, served with veggies but a bit too buttery tasting for me.\n- ROASTED THAI CHICKEN (4 stars): a bit dry, but otherwise good. \n- CAULIFLOWER (5 stars): imagine Kung pao chicken but cauliflower. Perfectly roasted, super firm yet cooked, doused in a delectable sweet and sour sauce. A bit sweet, but seriously could not stop eating this\n- FORTUNE COOKIE & MOUSSE (5 stars): didn't really taste like a fortune cookie, so much as like a vanilla crisp or something, but the killer part about this was the little bit of dark chocolate it's dipped in and the delicious both chocolate and vanilla mousse that it's served with. Also, it comes with fruit / so it's healthy right?\n\nTLDR: based on price, good for business dinners or if you're okay with spending. Lots of good potential dishes, you just have to know what to order."

Don't miss the Kung Pao Chicken here, I know it sounds gross, I too would save it for P.F Changs but it seriously was different and you will not regret it. Also try the shrimp in coconut sauce, but you should be a coconut friendly person. Overall great food and absolutely great service.\n\nTry the Mochi tasting for dessert or the mango rice pudding with ginger icecream or even better to try the Tao's Chocolate Martini... you would be in heaven for the next few minutes.

I love the walkway inside with the floating rose petals and the super comfy couch to sit on while waiting for your table.  We had reservations but still had to wait about 10 minutes which isn't too bad considering how mobbed it was.\n\nThe ambiance is swanky Asian and kind of dark which is nice.  We promptly ordered drinks upon sitting down.  I had the Lychee martini made with Ketel One, Triple Sec, and Lychee puree.  It was fucking fantastic - tasted fruity but not overly sweet and there was a piece of lychee on a skewer in the drink for you to munch on.  I can't say I've ever had this before but I will definitely try any lychee drink from now on.\n\nFor food we were a bit random and ordered a few different things.  We had the chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce.  I freakin love Thai peanut sauce so I loved this little appetizer.  Then we had some sushi rolls - I think they were spicy tuna - and they were also pretty good.  For our entree though we had Peking duck since our waitress told us they were known for this dish.  For $34 per person it better be phenomenal and perhaps cure cancer.  It came out and it is basically almost an entire duck served with what amounted to Asian tortillas and hoisin sauce.  There were also some onions and cucumbers to put on your tortilla.  I tried it with the tortilla but it just reminded me of an Asian taco so I just ate the duck alone.  The skin was shiny and crispy and the duck was juicy and fatty.  I don't know if it was worth $34 but it was damn delicious!  Eating it with chopsticks was a bit of a challenge so by the time we got to the drumstick I just picked the meat off with my hands...no shame in my game!\n\nOverall I was pleased with Tao and could definitely see going back to try some other things on the menu that looked interesting."

Anyone that has dined here, can't deny that the ambience is absolutely on point. You are swept away to another world upon entering\n\nI can only speak on my GO TO dishes every time I've dined. Get these and you won't be disappointed: Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice and the Miso Glazed Sea Bass. Did I mention that both of these can be made gluten free for this celiac? Yup, they can. The miso literally falls apart by practically just looking at it. The top has some sort of sweet and crispy delight baked in. It truly is divine. The Spicy tuna tartare that sits on a delectable crispy rice is out of this world. \n\nIt's a fun splurge, and worth a sexy Vegas night with friends or that special someone. Job well done"

As I said in my other reviews of Vegas places, you don't come here to save money so don't get mad at the price.\n\nWe ate like kings and queens here. Pretty much had the entire menu as each person ordered a different appetizer and main dish. Very fancy, delicious and FAST considering the whole place was packed and busting at the seams. The kitchen and wait staff do great here. \n\nEnded up paying $107 a person before tip. Totally worth it when in a big group because you try pretty much the entire menu and the price included 1 drink. I didn't need any more than 1 drink here anyway. No, not because they pour them so strong....because we pregame and I was all set, if you know what I mean. Hey, it's Vegas baby!!!"

The dining room is a scene AND it is enormous.  It is quite a feat that the kitchen is able to keep up with the dining room considering how large it is.  And given the people watching here, some restaurants might try to get away with the fact that their dining room is filled with a large number of scantily clad women.  Tao avoids that trap and serves up some pretty tasty Asian dishes and has the service to see that it gets served right."

The process of getting the dinner organized with the Tao staff was a huge pain in the ass (my good friend hosted). Basically, they know the place will be packed so if you don't want to deal with their bitchiness, they know someone else will gladly take your place.\n\nI f-ing hate that attitude.\n\nThat said, I had the BEST veggie potstickers on the planet here. The kung pao tofu was amazing - and I'm the one who doesn't like tofu. But it was fried (like Mo Mong's tofu luc lac) and soooooo tasty.\n\nI ordered a cappucino and it was horrific. Do not waste your money. \n\nI will say that once we were seated (after getting the runaround upon our arrival), the wait staff was very good. I appreciated that, bc obviously they knew a fat tip was built into the check, but they were on top of things and I didn't sense any attitude. \n\nEating here is just one of those Vegas things that's nice to do at some point, if you find yourself in Vegas.

We ordered the Pad Thai Noodles with Chicken, Fried Rice with Kimchee, Red Fried Rice with Pork Belly, Endamame, Lo Mein, & Long Beans.  \n\nIt was just OK.  Not fantastic.  It's bordering on westernized Chinese food.  The presentation of some of the dishes made me wonder why they selected their china that way.  The bowls were huge and on a pedestal and not your usual rice bowl.  Very difficult to eat noodles or rice.  They try to impress that they are using Chinese china in an interesting, splashy way but it doesn't make sense.  Why use a clay pot for long beans when there's hardly any beans in the dish?  You have to really look into the pot to grab the long beans!  \n\nD\u00e9cor is very nice.  Big Buddha as the centrepiece.  Dark with very low lighting and candles.  I had to get used to it.

We were trying to figure out where we could experience some fine dining, and we kept seeing signs for Tao at the Venetian. Right as we walked into the beautifully decorated walkway, I felt like I was stepping into a glamorous nightlife scene from a movie. There were floating rose petals on each side of the walkway lit by candles. \n\nOf course, there was a wait, but it was expected. However, instead of just standing around trying to pass the time, we sat down at their lounge area where we were waited on by a cocktail waitress. We ordered a few drinks before dining while snacking on their complimentary wasabi peas, and before we knew it, our table was ready.\n\nTheir decor deeper into the restaurant was even more impressive than the front of house. Behind me was an open sushi bar across from a wall displaying artistic pipes featured inside multi-colored backgrounds. In front of me was an enormous statue of Buddha surrounded by more candles.\n\nOur service was EXCELLENT. Since it was our first time there, our server really wanted to give us the full experience. He was very suggestive without being pushy, so it made our ordering much less difficult. The only thing that kind of threw us off, was when a new server took over without our being informed. The service, however, remained top-notch. They were anticipating our every need.\n\nThe pad-thai was good, the Shiitake mushroom tempura was delicious! Best tempura I've ever had. The desserts were creative and aesthetically pleasing. Definitely stop by if you want to make your trip to Vegas a memorable one."

The server said their signature dish was the miso sea bass, definitely worth trying, and our server suggested the sausage fried rice with fried egg on top, also amazing. Service was great, drinks were tasty. \n\nSo why only 4 stars?  A couple reasons. Number one, I don't like being sold something right away. When we sat down our server briefly went over the drink lists and immediately asked if we wanted something from the bar. Nice to ask, but how about giving us some time to look through the lists you just pointed out. Or even better, how about offering some water first.  And when I say offering, I mean offering all options. Not just bottled water. It just seems like a sneaky way to get just a little more money out of me. I don't want to feel like I'm at a car dealership when I'm eating at a restaurant. \n\nThe second reason for the downgrade was the robotic repetitiveness in the restaurant. Explanation. We got our appetizers, ther server came by and asked us if we had everything we needed and we said we were fine. 5 minutes later a  manager came by and asked us if we have everything we need and we said we were great. Our entrees came out and our server asked if we had everything we needed, we were fine. A few minutes later a different manager came by and asked us...you guessed it, do we have everything we need. Not how is the food or how are we enjoying everything so far, just do we have everything we need. Now, you might say to yourself that's not so bad. But it was just me and my friend, and all the tables of two are literally right next to each other so we can hear the interactions of all the tables around us.  We had 3 tables within earshot of our own, and I must have heard \"do you have everything you need?\" 15 times between the servers and the managers. It's one of those things that once you notice you can't help but hear it. \n\nNormally I wouldn't even nitpick over something so trivial but i also heard the other servers in the area ask for drink orders immediately and only offer bottled water.  These are all clearly restaurant policies that take away from the restaurant. I don't want to feel like a step in a training manual. All those little annoyances aside this restaurant is awesome. It's not the quietest restaurant in the world but as long as you understand you are eating essentially at a nightclub I highly recommend this place."

The best time we could get was 10:15. After waiting in line for the \"reservation check-in\" we were told they would call us when our table was ready and they gave us a pager. Well wait we did. We didn't get seated until and hour later! What kind of restaurant operation takes reservations and then makes you wait an hour anyway? That is really poor front of the house operation. \n\nFOOD: The Shabu-Shabu Filet was terrible. It tasted like they had left the raw meat sitting out for hours. The green beans we all ordered tasted like they drenched them in fish sauce, and I could tell that they had not changed the oil in their fryer in quite some time as the spring rolls (both appetizer and dessert kind) tasted like rancid oil and were too hard to bite through! Not one person at our table commented on liking their food. \n\nThe wait staff seemed to be attentive but that was only the first time our waiter came to the table. After that time we had to try and find our waiter to flag him down. When it came time to pay and we were obviously done for quite some time, he was nowhere to be found. Even worse, three of us paid to have sparkling water instead of just tap water and when we were about half way done with our glasses, someone actually came around and refilled them with with tap water! If you are going to hire people who can pay attention or at least ask the question, then maybe you should serve your waters in different glasses since there are three options.\n\nAfter our mediocre and ridiculously overpriced meal we went to go to the club upstairs. They came around and gave us stamps at the table that would allow us access without waiting in the long line and without paying. When the first person got to the front of the smaller line he was charged entry for two to get in ($50!!). Immediately we said, \"wait we don't have to pay\" Instead of being able to credit him back for the charge or just giving him cash, the manager came over and gave him drink tickets instead. He acted like he was being soooo nice by giving him and the girl he paid for a ticket and then a second one each. What, 4 drinks for $50, not including tip?? Geee, thanks so much for the generosity. To top it all off, the club sucks. Cheesy, bad flow and really bad air flow. We decided to go up the Tao Beach instead to get outside and that was better as far as being able to move around and breath, but the cockroaches running around were a bit of a turnoff.\n\nWith all of the choices in Vegas now, this place needs to step up their service and food quality or be replaced."

We thought this would be the best way to taste as many different types of food. \n\nEach of the dishes were quite exotic and very tasty. The service was great. They served most of the dishes at once and continued to clear the table as plates were emptied. It felt like they weren't going to stop serving us. There was so much food. The variety of the food was sufficient - dishes from the land, from the sky, from the sea (ie. meat, veggies, seafood).\n\nThey offered us free entry to the TAO nightclub because we were pretty big spenders that evening. Food and service was awesome. Ambiance was a little dark and the wait was a little disappointing despite the reservation. \n\nBut overall a great place to go."

A super popular place, so it is best that you make a reservation way in advance, although the walk-in wait for us was about 20-25 minutes.  There's a lounge/bar that you can sit at while you wait for a table.  \n\nI love their desserts.  Their food was standard in taste.  Portions are average.  However, a meal here can be quite expensive.  We came here mainly for their ambiance.  If you want awesome food at a good price, you don't really need to come to Tao."

And if that's not enough for you, inform your waiter that you plan on going to the club after dinner and they will give you a stamp that will get you in for free (both males & females) and let you skip the line. You can't beat that! \n\nWe visited Tao (Restaurant) on 4/1/10. We made same day reservations and they were able to accommodate us. I had the \"Crispy coconut shrimp with Thai peanut sauce\" and my date had the \"Soy ginger glazed salmon with udon noodles and spinach.\" Both dishes were great - Cooked perfectly, even to the toughest food critic's standards. However, I think the best part of the meal came at the end. Like any other Asian restaurant, they give you a free fortune cookie with your bill. But these are not your standard boring fortune cookies. The fortunes inside are a little more unique than most. Mine said \"You will receive a spanking in your near future\" and they bear the Tao logo on the corner. Definitely made us laugh at the end of a really great meal. \n\nOn the down side, prices are a little high here, but that is expected from any nice restaurant in Las Vegas. Don't let this deter you - This place is worth the splurge! I highly recommend Tao - I know I will make time for Tao every time I go to Vegas!"

There wasn't much flavor to the entrees other than salt.  The dessert was better than the appetizers and entrees. However the presentation was a little odd. The fresh fruit came served over crushed ice and was very unappetizing once the ice started to melt.\n\nAlthough the restaurant comped a few of our menu items, we still ended up paying 60 and 70 dollars respectively for a very poor quality meal. The atmosphere was nice but the food was definately not worth the price. I've had a better quality meal at panera bread for $15!"

Nope. \n\nYou must understand first that I have a serious problem when it comes to chocolate lava cake. All those kids down $1k at the poker tables got nothing on me and my lava cake. 6 months ago, I came to Tao for dinner and was the only one who wanted to get dessert (surprise, surprise). I ordered the lava cake for MYSELF because no one would split with me but I left for 15 min to pick up my friend from the hotel lobby and when I returned, the cake was GONE. Everything from the chocolate chopsticks to the ice cream and every drop of chocolate was G-O-N-E!!! My friends remind me as much as possible how delicious this cake was, and I've wondered about it ever since.\n\nIt's my last day in Vegas and I had yet to get my precious chocolate cake. After gorging myself on pounds of bacon wrapped fillet mignon and queso bread at a Brazilian Steakhouse, with just 20 min to make it to the Bellagio to see \"O,\" I called my order in and rushed over to Tao to pick up my precious lava cake. Gimme a break, it was my last chance!\n\nI got dropped off at the lobby and ran in to pick up my order, but when I looked in the bag I noticed they didn't have plastic forks. What?! I guess I'm probably the only one who has ever ordered something to go, so I sat down at the bar to take just one bite. Yum... (No I did not use my hands). \n\nMy friend went to the bathroom so I decided to continue eating while I waited. So I'm sitting at the bar by myself eating chocolate cake out of a plastic box, with chocolate on my face, and 10 bartenders gawking at me.\n\nMe: (Gorging myself with chocolate cake)\nBartender: Would you like a...uh... glass of water?\nMe: *om nom nom* no thanks *nom nom*\n\nBy the time my friend was back from the bathroom, the box was empty. Needless to say, after hearing me rave about getting this chocolate cake all weekend long, my friends who waited in the car, were shocked when I came back empty handed. \n\nI can't say I remember exactly how the cake tasted because I wolfed it down so fast, but I do remember the taste of victory, and it was glorious."

My dad made the reservation in advance and let them know we were celebrating a birthday.  There were six of us in the party, and we actually all arrived right on time!  The hostess said it would be a few minutes, so we sat at a table in the lounge area, ordered some drinks, and snacked on some of the wasabi peas.  The waitress that took our cocktail orders was sweet, and she made some great Taojitos for the group!  At 8:30, we were wondering why we had to wait so long and getting a bit ansy... we finally were taken to our table around 8:40.\n\nDinner was amazing once we were seated.  Chris was our server and took great care of us.  We enjoyed a round of appetizers including lobster dumplings, crispy tuna tataki, edamame, duck spring rolls, and eggplant tempura.  We also did dinner family style and shared wasabi steak, pad thai with shrimp, crispy snapper, seafood in black bean sauce, spicy eggplant, curry shrimp tempura maki, and pork fired rice.  It's two days later, and I am writing this all from memory - it was that good!  (Usually I would have to look back at the menu to remember what we ordered, but it all made a lasting impression in this case).  We literally cleaned all of the plates - everything was great, and quick too!\n\nLuckily, even with all of that food, we saved room for dessert.  Chris brought out a beautiful birthday cake for the birthday girl and boy (my bro and sis are twins).  I'm talking really quality, beautiful gourmet cake (like AJ's in AZ).  It had \"Happy Birthday A & Z\" written on it in chocolate and it was a vanilla layer cake of sorts.  \n\nI didn't pay the bill, and I'm sure it was expensive, but this was by far the best meal we had on the trip, and I'm sure it was worth it!  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the wait we had upon arrival - other than that, Tao was amazing!  Beautiful ambiance too - I'll have to go back next time to check out the nightclub!"

We were politely greeted by our server who was very enthusiastic about the place. I asked him what the most popular dish was & he responded with \" Miso Glazed Sea Bass \" . The fish was cooked properly, tasted & looked great. We also ordered \"Omakase\" style sushi which means that the consumer trusts the chef to create a plate based on his skills & tastes. This is where i was very disappointed, we payed $58 for 6 or 7 pieces of basic, dull sushi. Nothing creative or original. If i may add i personally think that Whole Foods sushi is gourmet compared to TAO sushi. After a disappointing dinner i had conversed with our waiter for a few minutes about fine dinning & how TAO is not anywhere near that. Once he realized that i am a true connoisseur of fine cuisine he immediately started to blame the restaurant for catering to people who don't get to try Asian cuisine & wont expect a 5 star quality, and thats why i wouldn't be impressed by anything there. He himself recommended us to a few 5 star sushi restaurants around town. For $120 with gratuity i feel like this place is not only a rip off but very hyped up for absolutely no reason besides the decor inside. Never going to dine at this establishment again."

We ate at Tao, the swanky upscale gorgeous GORGEOUS zen styled restaurant in the hotel, where our waiter looked like a cross between Bruce Lee and Richard Gere. Both Gene and I fell in love with him. We sat under a 30' high Buddha who perched on a koi pond, ate delectable food and exquisite drinks. I had a mango something martini, which accompanied the loverly 'Buddha's harmonized vegetables for the minor gods', among other sumptuous dishes. The place is so incredibly beautiful, in that insanely huge budget kind of way. The entry way is lined with bathtub looking pools, filled with rose petals and orchids, with floating candles in them. The walls are lined with Buddhist statues inset in thier own little cubbies, the rooms are divided by floor to 50' ceiling white sheers. Incredible. Not usually does the food match the decor, but in the name of all things holy, it was incredible. Each thing was more delicious than the next, and I don't know how they made the chocolate dessert thing we ate, but it was the most velvety, creamy incredible thing I might have ever eaten."

My girlfriends and I went to Vegas for Spring Break and decided to try out Tao.  There were 6 of us, and being poor college students, we did not want to splurge too much on the first day of vacay.  As such, we spent almost 20 minutes trying to decipher the menu and decide what to order -- I think our server came up to us at least 3 times in those 20 minutes.  Finally, we got over our shyness and asked him what he would recommend for us.  Our server was friendly, and directly asked our price range; we stated $30-$40 per person, at most.  He offered to put together a \"tasting menu\" JUST FOR US.  We were really grateful, and we immediately accepted the offer.  \n\nDISHES:  Most famous for their sea bass; our waiter ordered 3 appetizers of sea bass (2 sticks per order, so we each got one stick), a ravioli thing (I think?), and some other noodle and dumpling dishes.  When the food arrived, our server explained that he had given us a mix of the most popular dishes of their restaurant, and the dumplings and noodle things were just to \"fill us up.\"  Indeed, between the delicious food and omg-I-can't-get-over-the-sea-bass, we were extremely full by the end of dinner, and each person's bill averaged less than $30. \n\nWe were so happy with the food and service that we decided to tip more (I think we tipped like 25% lol).\n\nSo for my rating: \n\nsea bass: 5/5; all other food: 4/5\n\nservice: 5/5"

The food was ok and the bill wasn't outrageous, which can be a typical Vegas pitfall.\n\nWe ate family-style and had a roll that I'm fairly certain is an exact rendition of fish-food., which was partly our fault for eating sushi on a Sunday.  The food came out so quickly that we didn't really have much time to enjoy our meal.  That is not to say that they were trying to turn the table over though, it took about 45 minutes to receive our bill and pay for it.\n\nBottom-line: the food was mostly edible and the service was alright."

Taojitos and Taotinis flowed while waiting for our entrees.\n\nthe orange chicken was good, nothing over the top.  the coconut prawns  were huge and well worth the wait.  chicken with veggies and jasmine rice weren't anything to brag about either.  $50+ per girl was expected in the Venetian, but in the real world nothing was spectacular about the meal.  they did bring out a giant fortune cookie filled with pastry cream and topped with fresh fruit and chocolate drizzle for the bday girl, a definite added plus to make good on the hour wait.\n\nas a bonus you get in free to the club for dining first, but make sure to get the *line pass* stamp before leaving your table!!!"

The sushi, sashimi are very fresh and done with creativity and are flavorful.  The staff is very attentive and helpful, nice selection of deserts and sake.  I have not gone to the nightclub after hours but by the looks of the pictures on yelp looks like fun.  Anyway if you are in Vegas and want Asian/sushi this place has great food and lots of fun...

There are two types of people who come to TAO to eat: 1-those who actually come for the food 2-those who are using the restaurant to get into the club. I must admit first off that I fell into the second category because we brought only brought sausages to the party. That being said I still appreciate good food and the food was mediocre at best.  \n\nFor those who were wondering what the sashimi was like, wonder no more. It was small PERIOD. Four small pieces to be exact. Because I was freakin starving after that and for some crazy reason did not want all my calories to be liquids, we tried the Peking Duck. The duck came promptly but it was cold and bland tasting. For 60+ bucks you would think they could at least give us warm food. \n\nThe only benefit to eating here is that you can get a line pass into the club and you don't need to bring a slew of chicks with you. The service was prompt and our waitress was friendly. Our food was moderate at best and I left hungry and with much less money to spend on the ten dollar beers upstairs. I would have given this two stars but it receives three for the sole reason that it got us into the club without waiting. The extra money just might have been worth it to see the look on all the dudes faces in lines as we passed them by."

She just had me fill out a very simple CC Auth and we were good to go. \n\nGetting to the hostess stand can be a little bit of a journey as by the time you are getting in for dinner, people are already lined up to get into the club. Once you make it to the bathtubs (best part of TAO hands down) you are golden! \n\nAnd on to the food... \n\nStarted the meal with Pork or Chicken (sorry, I forget) Gyoza. It was good but CMON BABY, Gyoza is Gyoza. We also had the Vegetable Dumplings with Crunchy Cucumber Salad. Both were so light and refreshing. \n\nMy entree was a wassabi crusted Fillet with Onion Rings and a side of Sake braised Shiitake Mushrooms. The Mushrooms were so tastey and perfectly tender. I had when Shiitake's get mushy. The fillet came out a true medium rare and the Wassabi crust set it over the top. My spoiled ass even found a cab from Napa on the wine list. **Side note - don't you have being out of California and seeing whack wines on the menu?** \n\nToo bad I didn't leave room for that Giant Fortune Cookie I keep hearing about. \n\nAfter dinner you can also get a stamp that can get you another stamp that gets you into the club for free!"

He was probably 37, acting like he was 13 and a pube. He obviously hates his life. He didn't give our entire table menus, only a select few. And he gave us ONE drink list. When he asked us if there was anything else he could do for us, in a very fresh tone, I leaned in and told him to dial down the sass. Needless to say we were then approached by a waitress for a dual effort. The food was good but you have to order several plates to make you full. By the time it finally arrives at the table, good luck trying to remember what is what. It all looks and tastes relatively the same. One positive thing, the sushi was great. Management definitely relies on the fact that this place is considered trendy. I would pass, unless you hate the person you are with lol"

XS, Marquee are probably the hottest night clubs right now in Vegas but don't count out Tao. Once midnight hits and the patio is open Tao is shoulder to shoulder busy with people all over the place partying.\n\nWe all took advantage of the popularity of Tao nightclub by eating at Tao which provides expedited access to their night club.\n\nMy initial impressions of Tao was a restaurant trying to cash in on the Asian theme. When you walk into Tao and see how it opens up however, you're quickly reminded that a lot of thought had gone into designing the space. Lights are dim to set the mood which plays off the color scheme quite well. A giant Buddha statue sits in the middle of an open hall that spans two floors. Asian art is hung everywhere with bamboo vegetation. At the same time, it wasn't hokey, I really appreciated what they were trying to do here.\n\nOnto the food itself, our parties ordered a large number of appetizers which were delectable. I suggest the sashimi platter which had bite-sized party-in-your-mouth morsels of deliciousness.\nMy main meal was a deep sea dive scallops in basil curry. If you had a bowl of rice to this dish, it is such a full complete meal considering. The sauce was rich and the scallops itself were very large.\n\nI would definitely recommend you explore other sea food dishes as my samplings of them were also quite rich."

I'm not sure if it's because priority is given to the paying customers, or if it's just turned into one of those places. I don't think I would stay if I had to wait 30+ minutes for a table plus pay a lot of $$ for food.  \n\nSince they give us a variety of appetizers and sushi each time, I have some favorites.  The stuffed shrimp and the chicken skewers are delicious! We get those almost every time. The dumplings are also decent.  And the sushi is always fresh. I never had rubbery fish there. The unagi is also really good. My favorite dessert are the won tons and ice cream.  \n\nOf course Tao is really trendy, loud and always crowded.  The restaurant is huge and most of the people are young and pretty.  Although most of the time you see a huge group of strippers.  We've always had good service even though the restaurant is busy.

Niiiiice. The waiters were all young and not hard on the eyes either...heeeey."

It was our friend's 30th birthday, and we wanted to make it special. But we had no idea what to order. After asking a few questions, he surprised us with course after course of FANTASTIC food. He knew what we wanted as if we had been friends with him for ages. More importantly, he believed in what he was serving. Because of his passion for what he was doing and for the food he was serving, it became contagious. WE LOVED JOSH! \n\nJosh if you are reading this, THANK YOU for making our experience one of the best experiences we had in our trip to Vegas."

I didn't know about this secret the first time I ate there and had wound up ordering the sea bass, which I found to be overly hyped.  The tasting menu consists of a multi-course meal of items selected by the chef depending on your food preferences and your price point ($60-$120 per person).  If you're in town for a short time and don't see yourself visiting again any time soon, the tasting menu is what to request!"

It was slightly warm, mushy, and the texture made my skin crawl. The signature sea bass is why I usually like coming to eat here and it's been always great in the past but the combination duck fried rice was hard and seemed like it had been sitting out. The fried whole fish was pretty good, I ate everything from the tail to the eyeball and was pretty pleased with it. The duck rolls were bland and our lobster rolls were tasteless and chewy which wasn't good at all. During this last dinner at Tao we ordered $240.00 worth of food between the 2 of us and was only happy with the snapper, miso soup and sea bass. The appetizers were all a disappointment and even our 4 drinks weren't made to our liking. \n Although I've had a good experience at Tao before, this last one wasn't good at all. Not sure if we will return again but who knows what will happen while in Vegas right?"

Here's a random collection of thoughts, along with a really cool story about what happened to me here!\n\nService: my waitress was cheerful and pretty cool. The people at the front, however, along with the reservations girl, were aloof in the \"too-cool-for-school\" kind of way. Also, this place doesn't give current wait time if you call and ask them, which is unnerving (is this a problem specific to Vegas?).\n\nAtmosphere: 5/5. This is where Tao earns its stripes. It is a truly beautiful restaurant, with a big golden Buddha resting in the center of the restaurant, framed by lots of red booths and dark lighting. Think of it as a PF Chang's on steroids. Beautiful inside!\n\nFood: Nothing to write home about, about on the level of PF Chang's, but still pretty good. I tried their Orange Chicken ($28), with white Jasmine rice ($5), and it was fairly tasty (though I wasn't blown away). I also had the vegetable egg rolls ($12), and those were pretty good as well, but again not mind-blowing. \n\nStory 1: I came here alone (I was in Vegas on business, and no not that kind of business), so I kinda felt like the guy in forgetting Sarah Marshall who comes to the restaurant, where Jonah Hill says \"aw dude, you came alone? Do you want a magazine or something?\"\n\nStory 2: Also, I ran into multi-billionaire, and Venetian owner, SHELDON ADELSON right by this place. I looked him right in the eye, he looked me in the eye! And then he looked away, and I felt poor."

The apps were a great size and yummy dumplings/veggie spring rolls. For a fancy place the sushi is decently priced its so fresh !!!!

We were staying at the Venetian, so it seemed appropriate that we went here for dinner, plus we heard you get free access to Lavo (the other club at the Palazzo) if you eat there.\n\nWe had 8:30 reservations and when we got to the place on a Tuesday night, we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The place did not seem that crowded, especially for a weeknight. Anyways, once we were seated, we told the waiter about the reason for our trip and he said we would be taken care of! After browsing the menu we settled on Filet Mignon Pepper Steak ($35) and Pad Thai Noodles with Chicken ($19) and we each had a specialty cocktail. The Filet Mignon pepper steak might have been the best thing I have ever eaten. It was fabulous. I know it was my husband's favorite meal of the entire trip. I mean, pepper steak from most chinese restaurants is pretty good, but then when you add filet mignon to the dish- it takes it to a whole new level! The pad thai was pretty good too, but the star of the meal was the pepper steak.\n\nAfter our meal, our waiter brought us over 2 glasses of champagne and we weer able to choose a dessert for free. We selected the Yuzu Sugar Dusted Donuts with a trio of 3 dipping sauces. OMG these were amazing. They were warm and crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. The dipping sauces made this dessert extra special. \n\nWe had great service here, the decor was very romantic and I would definitely go back to this place next time I am in Vegas!"

We celebrated my husband's birthday and had a group of 9. The restaurant was busy as is expected on a Saturday night but once we were seated, the staff treated us as if we were the only client in the restaurant which made the night special. \n\nDaniel waited on our party and he was extremely kind and accommodating, especially with dietary needs/ allergies of one person in our party. Being our first time at Tao, I asked for suggestions and he was very knowledgeable on the menu. He made fantastic recommendations throughout the night. Amongst our favorites were the Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice which combines the soft tuna with the crispy rice which work very well together; lobster wontons which had a welcomed complexity in flavor; and the miso glazed sea bass which was light, flaky, moist and so flavorful. I should also point out that the plates are family style portions for sharing which allows for interaction and great conversation. We had several dishes throughout our meal, wait staff were constantly removing empty plates, so our table never felt crowded or tight, our glasses were never low and they were there when we were ready for the next course. \n\nFood was outstanding, presentation was memorable and the service, superb!  The GM, Matt was beyond attentive and came by several times to make sure everything was perfect. He was very friendly and charismatic and treated us like family. Nick also stopped by during the latter part of our dinner to check on us, introduce himself, and let us know that he would be escorting us to the club upstairs once dinner was over. Nick treated us like a longtime friend and escorted us to the club to finish off the night with a bang! \n\nI definitely recommend Tao and I am already looking forward to our next visit!

Note: Your required to confirm the day of the reservation before Noon.  Checked in with the matre' D was pleased to be escorted directly to our table.  It was already crowded with people at the lounge having drink while waiting for their own table?? There was 3 of us for dinner-2 guys and myself.  We were lead toward the back and seated at a table close to the sushi bar. Before you read any further this review is truly dedicated the service and to our waiter vs. the food.  In celebration of my birthday we ordered a bottle of the yellow label and Voss Sparkling water. After reviewing the menu, I asked the waiter what recommendations he had, and even though we ended up not getting anything that was mentioned, I thought it was great that he had extensive knowledge about the food.  We ordered:  Satay of chilean sea Bass with grilled asparas, Wasabe crusted filet mignon with tempura onion rings, Duck friend rice,Noodles and Short-ribs.  The food honestly was mediocre for the price that you are paying.  There are so much more comparable quality food here in SF  that don't cost and arm and a leg.  Needless to say I wasn't too disappointed as my expectations weren't that high, and I was paying to be part of the scene.  Now Kudos for the service, the waiter was extremely courteous, came at the right times to offer service,and always made sure that glasses were always filled.  I'm a lightweight and only drank a glass of champagne, I thought it was wonderful  that he was so observant and only filled up my companions glasses and only towards the end of dinner did he offer me more.  and lastly because there was a male to female Ratio at the clubs, even with a $300 dollar dinner I still wouldn't have been able to get in, he worked the magic and got all 3 of us line passes for the club because it was my birthday.  Above and Beyond.  \nIn summary: Tao Restaurant is a place to see and be seen, just don't have too hight expectations about the food.  Especially for those of you who live here in SF."

I like to take my out-of-town guests here for a one-stop dinner/club experience and we always have an amazing meal and an amazing time.\n\nI have pretty much tried everything on the menu at this point and I've never had a dish I didn't like. There are two dishes that I adore and frequently re-order: (warning, I get pretty cheesy about the following dishes)\n\n The Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass\n*Located in the \"From The Sea\" section of the menu\n\nOh my gosh, the sea bass.... This would very likely be my last meal on Earth! The sea bass is usually prepared to the perfect melt-in-your mouth consistency with a subtle miso glaze that delicately balances the flavor of the fish. On a few occasions it came out slightly overdone and they happily sent out another one.\n\nSalmon Sashimi with Avocado, Crispy Onions\n*Located in the \"Special Dishes\" section of the menu\n\nThis is one of those genius dishes that seems so simple until you take that first magical bite. The combination of texture and flavor is mind-blowing. The salmon sashimi, avocado, and sweet and spicy sesame sauce flavors with just a hint of crispy onions brilliantly balance each other like like a symphony of flavors in your mouth! \n\nAfter you finish your incredible meal, Tao will send you off with a naughty little fortune cookie. And if you're lucky, maybe it will come true ;) Hey, it's Vegas!\n\nSo do yourself a favor and check it out. If you have a night of clubbing ahead, you can usually get escorted into the nightclub upstairs from your table.\n\nTip: If you're just a small party of 2-3 and they don't have any reservations available at the time you want, you can usually just head back to the sushi bar and get a seat right away."

Glad we had reservations because the place got packed in just a few minutes. It was very dark and very loud. We spent most of the night yelling, \"WHAT?\"  across the table. Some even ended up texting each other during dinner. Our service was pleasant and all of our food came out in under 10 minutes. I ordered the hot and spicy soup and the veggie dumplings. Everyone at our table was pleased with their orders. The drinks were typical Vegas Strip prices, but I heard that they were delicious. Our waiter brought us a HUGE dessert tray to share in honor of the special occasion. I think the dessert plate may have been the highlight of the evening."

(It's been reported that the Tao Restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in Vegas!)  Just as we were about to enter the hallway, this VERY large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  Talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!\n\nWe were seated upstairs on the balcony overlooking the huge Buddha.  As menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  As I perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, I didn't even know where to begin.  My fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. Grilled Kobe Sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.\n\nThe menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  I could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (I would not consider Tao to be romantic at all.)\n\nIn the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  And this is what we got:\n\nSquab Lettuce Wraps ($14) - This came with five lettuce leaves.  A decent amount to fill all the leaves.  The squab mixture was a bit too moist and the BF found it too sweet.  I had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  There was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.\n\nLobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth ($16) - A clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  Very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  A very light and delicate dish.  \n\nSashimi of Kobe Beef with Fresh Wasabi Sauce ($28) - Beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  We couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  Lovely taste and clean.  However, I didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.\n\nPork Spring Roll with Thai Chili Sauce ($11) - This order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  The spring roll was decent, nothing particular special about it.  The Thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.\n\nMiso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ($34) - Very good, but I guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece of Chilean sea bass?\n\nRoasted Thai Buddha Chicken ($26) - We must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  It did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces of chicken in it, including the drumstick.  It was okay, nothing particularly special about it.\n\nJasmine White Rice ($4) - Of course we had to order some rice!  We got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.\n\nOverall, the food was good.  Definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a certain kind of clientele.  You'll be amused to find things like Kung Pao Chicken ($26) and Grilled Prime Porterhouse with Wasabi Dipping Sauce ($88) on the same menu.  We decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended Giant Fortune Cookie ($10) or Fuji Apple Springroll ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (We actually drove over to Luv-It Frozen Custard instead!)\n\nService is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and Tao fails in this department.  I was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the BF to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (Uh, who does that?!)  As they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  I felt like I was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  I'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  The waitstaff should take a few lessons from Rosemary's Restaurant's waitstaff.  That's what I call service!\n\nAt the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  And it was...just okay.  They asked if we were going to the club afterward and I said yes and asked if they had any passes.  What they do have is a \"line pass,\" which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  However, you will still have to pay cover.  (I think this part is rather ridiculous.  They should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  With the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  Not the best pass I would say.\n  \nTao Restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.    There are better places where service is valued higher.\n\n$185 total, including tip and tax, no drinks"

Instead, what I got was an unexpected surprise...\n\nWe arrived on time for our 8:00 p.m. reservation and were seated relatively quickly. The ambiance is very chic and trendy and the noise level actually wasn't as loud as I was expecting. Since there were six of us, we decided to order a variety of items from the menu like the Kung Pao Chicken, Shrimp Tempura Rolls, Crunchy Spicy Yellowtail Roll, Coconut Shrimp, and Spicy Smoked Salmon Roll to name a few.\n\nOnce the food began to arrive, we all started indulging in the sushi dishes. As I took my first bite of the Shrimp Tempura Roll (which was delicious by the way), I felt something hot dripping down my back... it was the Coconut Shrimp!!! YES, THE COCONUT SHRIMP! One of the people bringing the food to our table (not our waiter) had accidentally spilled the dish on my brand new WHITE blazer. Now, I understand that accidents happen. What bothers me is that the only apology I heard, was from our waiter (Edmond?) who had NOTHING to do with the incident. Even the manager did not apologize right away. He said he'd be back to check in on me... he did NOT check in on me during the remainder of the meal. \n\nOnce the six of us finished our meal, a complimentary platter filled with an assortment of desserts was delivered to our table (giant fortune cookie, ice cream, molten chocolate cake, chocolate Buddha)... as an apology I'd imagine since the only one I received by that point was from our waiter. Then (hallelujah!), the manager reappeared. He brought me a dry cleaning slip (which was useless considering I was leaving the next morning). He offered to reimburse me for the dry cleaning costs and if for some reason the dry cleaner could not remove the stains, they'd replace my white blazer for me. Then, once we received the bill, I FINALLY heard him apologize for the incident.\n\nWe were not comped for even a portion of the meal or offered a discount even though we asked. The waiter actually laughed when we asked which I felt was very unprofessional. We paid and left... never to return again! The food was pretty good but not worth the inconvenience and terribly unprofessional service from the management to the servers. Though Tao Asian Bistro had been recommended to us, we will not be recommending this place nor dining here in the future. I'll stick to Katsuya!\n\nP.S. After dinner we went back to the hotel so I could change before going out. Turns out the Coconut Shrimp seeped through my white blazer and onto my shirt as well. I've posted the photos on my account.

Once seated we got our drinks pretty quick and ordered a ton of small plates of: springrolls, spicy tuna rolls, prawns, yummy kobe sirloin, lobster wontons, etc.. Everything tasted pretty good but I was not wowed.  I ordered the chocolate parfait and it was the best!! Service seemed very prompt overall.  I think the place is nice but pretty pricey and maybe just a place you go one time and that is it."

And when they mean fine they mean FINE! This place is awesome and also gets you front of line status if you want to go to Tao nightclub.\n\nSince we had such a large party (8) we couldn't get a reservation until 1045. A little late for dinner....but its Vegas....I woke up at 5PM so it's not that late ;-)\n\nWe were seated and our server was very helpful in explaining the menu and the items on it and mentioning the special of the night. \n\nSo I had the 8oz wasabi encrusted filet mignon. BEST STEAK ever!!! I have eaten at most of the \"Fine\" steak houses in San Diego and one other steak house in Vegas but this one takes the cake. It was so tender and beautifully cooked (medium rare). My friends also had the special of the night (a 12oz Rib Eye) this was also very good and cooked perfectly. We also had the beef shabu shabu pot....it was good but I wish we could have tried the kobe beef...that would have been awesome. Either way I could have eaten the broth by itself. The other thing that stood out was the kobe beef carpaccio. EXCELLENT!! Marinated and cut exquisitely.\n\nAll in all the best restaurant I have eaten at so far in my 27 years."

We had 9 pm dinner reservations, and we weren't seated until 11.  Plus one star for comping us a free round of drinks, no small feat when there were 16 of us, and a round of appetizers, but only one because the food took an hour to arrive and was lukewarm and when it did, not to mention uber salty.  The quality was low - anyone who says it's any good obviously hasn't had any Chinese food that's any better than P.F. Chang's.  The only reason to have dinner here is to avoid the line for the club, but when you've got a bachelorette party totaling 16 chicks, there is really no need to wait in line anywhere, or pay any cover charges.  I suspect the reason why we wound up here (and many of the other dining patrons) is because this place was featured on the Kardashians.  Go figure. :P"

Even my husband (who enjoys a good eyeful) said that the whoreishness of the waiting area servers was obnoxious and way over the top.\n\nWe got a table right next to the big statue and the candle wall and that was really nice. Our server (luckily not one of the whoreish ones) was really nice and spent a little time talking to us and just being hospitable.\n\nWe LOVED the food. A wide range and many different things to try. I think there is something for everyone, if they like the 'out of the ordinary' Asian food.\n\nThis (of course) being Vegas and in the Venetian is going to have that little extra price tag, but it was exorbitant and we though it was worth paying a little more for the experience of TAO.\n\n-1/2 a star for the stupid waiting time, -1/2 a star for the hooker waitresses."

They also made me give them my credit card and said they were going to have to split my party up at two tables. When we got there, they said we could wait 15 minutes for a large enough table for all of us (and we didn't have to pay $90 per person for the pre fix menu like they had initially wanted!) They poured us all drinks and this left plenty of time for photos with the Tao backdrop! The waiter recommended splitting the meals family style and though the portions weren't huge, we had plenty of food and the bill was actually not too badly priced!! Way less than I expected! They brought out a cool looking dessert as well!  The only thing I will say is the restaurant is dimly lit and the atmosphere isn't as night club/lively as I would have thought Tao restaurant would be. We got stamped so we could just walk up the stairs to the nightclub and had to get a second stamp which was kind of a pain but overall great way to get in without worrying about waiting in line."

An enormous Buddha statue in the center of the restaurant and an almost converted warehouse feel in the back feel a little disjointed from what you see when you first walk in, though.\n\nThe weird warehouse section is where two of my friends and I sat for dinner tonight. We tried the bubbly blueberry sake which I have to admit was not my idea, because seriously, that sounds *^%*# gross. However, I was really surprised by how delicious it was. Sweet and effervescent with no real sake taste at all. I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered two sushi rolls. The mountain spring roll was good but I do wish I would have been told it was served on a wasabi sauce before ordering. I also ordered the spicy lobster roll, which I would just rate as ok. The sushi here was decent, and definitely better than most of what I can find in my landlocked home state of Kansas, but I have to be honest when I say I've had much better sushi not only on the coast, but in even in Vegas. \n\nFor dessert one friend and I split the molten chocolate lava cake. The box you see in the picture is chocolate shell and when you break it away the molten cake inside is much smaller. The taste was good but nothing outstanding or memorable. The cake was served with a salted caramel ice cream which was super salty. I stopped after one bite but my friend finished the rest, so it might just be an acquired taste.\n\nThe wait staff was attentive and the water glasses were kept filled. My major complaint was that we were sat by the entrance to the kitchen and my chair was repeatedly bumped into and hit by servers walking by. This was really distracting and even caused my purse to fall off the chair and hit the floor twice, so I kept having to bend over and pick it up again. For this level of meal and this level of restaurant, I would expect to not have endured that distraction.\n\nI've heard a lot about Tao so I'm really glad I tried it out, but with all of the other great options in Vegas to choose from, I'm unlikely to return."

Everything is just gorgeous.\n\nThe short rib appetizer special melted in your mouth, and service was on point all night, explaining the specials and checking in on us frequently.

Very good dish. \n\nEverything our table ordered was outstanding, and I would love to come back to try their sushi and specialty rolls. I think my only complaint is that Tao advertises a dress code, but then you do see LV tourists traipsing in with their shorts and sandles.

If everyone in your party orders an \"entree\" (which range from $30-$45), you get free admission into the club.  The best part is that you can bypass the ridiculous line altogether!  It's a win-win situation...considering the entrance fee would have been $40 for guys.  Keep in mind the club opens at 10pm, so schedule your dinner upwards of 8pm.  \n\nGoing back to the food, my expectations were pretty low.  I was expecting extremely sub-par PF chang's style food, but I actually came out decently impressed.  I ordered the Pepper beef filet Mignon and it had quite a bit of meat and decent flavor.  The beef was tender and cooked pretty well.  The Sea bass would probably be the star entree here.  I got to try some of it and it was actually pretty good (think Yardhouse Sea Bass).\n\nLong story short, if you're looking into getting 10 guys into a club and don't want to wait in line, Tao Asian Bistro should definitely be at the top of your list.  The food here is just a perk of getting into the club, but don't be surprised if you enjoy the food (stick with the pepper filet mignon, sea bass, or scallops and you'll be fine) . 4 stars."

It was Friday night and we had to meet friends back in our rooms at 9:30pm, so I made an early reservation at 7:30pm. We arrived at 7:30 to be told \"your table is almost ready, please have a seat in the lounge\". I ordered the Tao-tini, which was way too sweet. Not bad, just tasted like Kool-aid and not what I expected. In 15 minutes we were called for our table and then promptly forgotten about as we stood awkwardly adjacent to the host stand and three other tables were seated ahead of us. Another 10 minutes before we are shown to our table. It's now nearly 8pm so we quickly place another drink order and review the menu. (Great atmosphere and cool vibe coming from the restaurant, BTW.) So by at 8:15pm we flag down a waiter (not ours, he disappeared) to order. We promptly got our appetizer and then we waited. And waited more. We ordered sushi and Shabu Shabu. Items that you DO NOT NEED TO COOK. So please tell me why our food took 45 minutes to arrive? At this point it was 9pm and our remaining friends had arrived early to the hotel so one gal barely ate and left to go meet them with the room key while the remaining group ate in the most un-lady like fashion and scarfed our plates of food. Ridiculous. The manager came over at that point to offer us another round of drinks and dessert on the house!?!???? We were already late, and no we don't want to be delayed even further. He ended up comping our app and drinks instead. \n\nAll in all the food was good, the drinks were mediocre and the service was terrible.

We thought Tao was the perfect place for dinner because we heard about the great food and if you eat dinner there \n\nLater that evening we got to the restaurant at 9:40 to make sure we were seated promptly. A lot of us were starving because of the late dinner reservation but that was what we could get. 10:10 we stil weren't seated. I decided to go drop off something at the hotel room since we were staying in the Palazzo. Being that we had a late dinner reservation I decided to try to get a stamp to ensure that I could easily come back to the restaurant. I go to this desk near the door to ask for a stamp. The guy tells me that I need to get in line for a stamp. I look at the line and it's empty so I crawled under the rope. Immediately this security guard comes over.\n\nGuard: Excuse me Maam, you'll need to go all the way outside to get in line. You can't line jump.\n\nI look out at the entrance which was only a few feet from me and there's still no one in line.\n\nMe: Umm there's no one in line.\n\nGuard: I know that but you can't line jump. My manager won't have it and I'll be the weak link.\n\nSo begrudgingly I go outside. There's another guard at the entrance. He proceeds to tell me that it's a $20 cover to get in.\n\nMe: What? I was just in the restaurant and they told me to come out here to get a stamp. I have dinner reservations here and just want to drop something off in my room\n\nGuard 2: Well if you have dinner reservations you'll have to get in the reservation line to get a stamp.\n\nMe: I was in the reservation line to check in and they didn't give us a stamp.\n\nGuard 2: Well that's where you'll need to go\n\nI stand in the reservation line. A guy is yelling at the hostess letting her know that he's been waiting 50 minutes for a table, and they had reservations too. The hostess wasn't giving in and the guy got angry, threw the pager at her, and yelled some obscenities.\n\nI proceed to tell my story to the hostess and she tells me that she has to get the stamp girl to come over to give me a stamp and I have to wait. My friend Kelly comes up to the desk because we've been waiting for a while for our table. Kelly talks to the hostess.\n\nHostess: Oh right, you had a table for 4\n\nKelly: No 8. You guys called this morning to confirm\n\nHostess: 8? Oh... well then you'll have to come back in 5 minutes and then I can tell you what's available.\n\nKelly: Why can't you tell me what's available now? We had 9:45 reservations and it's 10:20 now.\n\nHostess: Just come back in 5 minutes and I'll let you know what's available.\n\nkelly and I are upset but because we had a group of girls for a bacheleorette and they all wanted to go clubbing, Tao was the best option because we get dinner and the club included so we decide to proceed with dinner.\n\nI then proceed to ask the hostess again about the stamp. She says that I need to finish my dinner before I can get stamped. UGH!\n\nWe finally get seated and eat our meal. The food isn't that great. I've gotten better at normal $5 chinese restaurants. The waiter brings Kelly brown rice instead of white. She mentions it and he says, \"Don't worry I won't charge you for it.\" \n\nAt the end of dinner, lo and behold we were charged for the rice. Kelly mentions it and tells the guy that he said he wouldn't charge.\n\nWaiter: I don't remember saying that. Since you ate it we have to charge you for it\n\nKelly: No i mentioned it to you and you said you wouldn't. That's the reason I ate it\n\nWaiter: Tell you what. I can hook you up. I'll get the girl to stamp you so that you can get into the club.\n\nWe are SUPPOSED TO GET INTO THE CLUB if we have dinner there!!! Never again will I go there!"

I did a lot of research at other spots for a nice set menu dinner, and we ended up choosing Tao based on what they offered for the given price, and their great location on the strip. We almost did a steakhouse dinner elsewhere, but it would have come with less courses, and about $100 more per person.  \n\nAnyway, working with the Tao group was great. They provided us with a nice custom set menu, which really gives the dinner an 'official' feel, and always impresses the guest of honor. We all arrived and were greeted and escorted to the semi-private dining room which overlooks the restaurant. I was a bit shocked because I thought we needed 16 to get the room, but I guess based on our time slot and availability, we were able to be seated there.  This was awesome, and the whole group was way impressed already. \n\nWe had a great spread of food, and they did a wonderful job with the portions and dividing it up well based on the seating. It wasn't tons of food, but it was still a good amount to leave everyone happy. The Peking duck spring rolls were a huge hit during the appetizer course. For our entrees, we went with orange chicken and the wasabi crusted filet mignon, and then a bunch of sides. Both were big hits, especially the orange chicken.  Then the dessert course came, which was ridiculous. The spread they brought out could have filled everyone up if that was the only thing we ate. Everything was amazing. \n\nAlso the service was great throughout the event. No one seemed to be waiting for a drink which was awesome.  We were probably loud with speeches/toasts/etc, so having the semi-private area was perfect. \n\nAll in all, everything went so smoothly from course to course, and we all left there in great spirits for the night ahead. Every one of the guys kept giving me props setting the dinner up and praises for how the food was just right in terms of what we got and how much we got of it.  It was an awesome feeling and confirmed that we definitely chose the right place for our bachelor parfy dinner, so I wanted to share some of the credit by writing this review. \nBravo."

We awkwardly wandered through the restaurant until we reached the sushi bar in the back and there we not even any open seat there.

We said we wanted to hold off on ordering drinks until we got our food.\n\nA different waiter than or original one brought out our food and we were never checked on. Didn't have the chance to order drinks, no one asked how our food was or if we needed anything...we were totally ignored. I ended up asking a third staff member in passing to bring me a drink. A man who appeared to have a managerial position based on the way he was dressed was wandering around our area for awhile and never even picked up on the fact that we were not being helped. About an hour later we had to ask him where our server was just to get our bill and neither apologized to us.\n\nI had high expectations for this place based on the prices and reputation but was extremely disappointed and will not be back next time I'm in town."

As some of the doors are left open, you cannot therefor see which is labeled men and women. And on top of that, they use 'Yin' and 'Yang' as labels for those instead.

We didn't get to see any of these mega stars but I did see Lebron's birthday cake as it was being brought in, complete with basketball and crown!\n\nI made these reservations weeks in advance and confirmed them several times. The restaurant is so intimidating which should be the opposite since it has such a Zen feeling as you walk in with the tubs at the entrance filled with orchids and candles.  The most surprising thing was seeing families for the early dinners.  I really thought this place was a couples romantic dinner place.  They also have a sushi bar.  We got there a little before 7 p.m. and someone had a baby and another family had some teenagers. It was a nice mixed crowd.\n\nThe very dark lounge is where we started and we were in the mood for Mai Tai's. Waitress took her time getting to us so we walked up to the bar.  We are big on birthdays.  Last year we went to Hawaii so the Mai Tai's seemed fitting since we stayed state side.  They were fabulous!  So if your a Mai Tai drinker, have one here. You get a nice slice of fresh pineapple too.\n\nWe got a booth and I have to say that I wasn't too happy since it wasn't facing the giant buddha.  But after our gorgeous waiter appeared, I mean our friendly waiter appeared all was forgotten (or was it the Saki bombers that did it?)\n\nEvery recommendation he made we took.  It was our first time here so we were happy to be guided through the menu.  \n\nWe shared everything so we started with the Lobster Potstickers, it was served in a hot pot with mushrooms and this incredible sauce OMG it was so mild yet the most delectable tasting dish I have had in a really really really long time. Next for the main course was the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass-wow!  Another melt in your mouth experience.  We also had some wasabi crusted steak...melts in your mouth, it was like buttah.  We had some scallops and brown rice, it was honestly the best meal I've had in Vegas...it's one of the top 10 dinners that I've had in my life! \n\nOur waiter Brad deserves his own review.   If Tommy Lee from Motley Crue had a handsome, classy, smart and sweet fabulous twin, this would be him.  Wow! 5-star service! He was super hospitable and friendly.   Very attentive and helpful. He's the best waiter in Vegas! Ask for Brad!\n\nHe also brought out a nice dessert for the hubby complete with candle and chocolate written HAPPY BIRTHDAY on the plate.  Brad was also nice enough to give all of us some VIP stamps to check out the nightclub for free! No waiting in line...woohoo!\n\nThe downer?  The restrooms say YIN and YANG or something along those lines. So if you've been hitting the sauce, you will just have to try a door. If you see a male bathroom attendant (like I did) you're in the wrong restroom (if you're a girl).  \n\nAnother downer? It's one of those restrooms where you can see under the mirrors.  So ladies, if you want to do any SPANX or bra adjustments, do them in the privacy of the water closet. Otherwise, the dudes will get a great show (no wonder I started seeing $1 bills popping under the mirror! WT...?)\n\nCheck this place out if you come to Vegas! You'll love it!"

By the time we got seated it was clear that our waitress was either exhausted or could not handle the amount of tables she had because frankly - she sucked. She forgot drinks, forgot to put in orders, took 20 minutes to bring over the check, and wasn't even friendly or apologetic. I sampled a few things - the duck spring rolls which were ok, the coconut shrimp which were decent but nothing to write home about, and some sushi and sashimi which was again - just OK. Anything else we had was not memorable. Like I said at the beginning, the drinks were fabulous but obviously pricey - hey it is Vegas! But I could've drank the \"Geisha Girl\" martini all night.

At first we thought it was a strobe light, but it quickly became annoying.  \n\nFinal weird note: we talked to out waiter about sex.  I'll leave the details to your imagination."

Our drinks were good (can't remember what those were either, lol Vegas+alcohol = forgetfulness). However, I do remember that overall, the food was okay, the drinks were okay, and restaurants decor was gorgeous, and I don't remember our waiter either so they were probably just ok. \n\nThey did surprise me with a giant fortune cookie with fruit since it was my Birthday and that was very sweet, that's where my extra star comes Iol, if it wasn't for that, I would have given it 3 stars.\n\nDidn't go to the nightclub but hopefully next time I'll check it out.

After complaining that this was unacceptable, the host picked up our first round of drinks. \n\nOnce seated, the noise level in the restaurant makes talking next to impossible. I felt myself yelling to communicate, which I am sure perpetuates into an even louder restaurant. \n\nWe had ordered a king crab roll. It was mediocre at best. I have had thicker crab meat at the buffet across the street. And for this price ($18 if I recall correctly), I am sure 50% of the price was paying for where I was eating. \n\nThe highlight of the meal was the dessert. We had the yazu trio donuts.

But i give it the benefit of doubt that they will proof me wrong. The service was \"OK\" not bad or great. The food was however, horribly salty. i can't even finish 4 bites, even the desert is ok not great as i remember. so don't eat here unless you want to impress your date or desperately craving for chinese food. \n\n\nLounge: it's a good lounge and you should kick it here. I gave the lounge a 5stars.\n\nClub: the only good thing about eating here is the fact that you get to cut in line when they open the club. However, its so crowded in here that you can't dance or walk. you get to see semi-nude dancer though. it's better if you come here with a VIP table so at least you get to sit when you get tire and the drink is within an arm reach. \n\n\nOverall: if you never try Tao Bistro I recommend you try, since I'm asian my expectation of what chinese food should be is kinda high. For me their food is not that great, you should try the Grand Wok @ the MGM they are alot better. \n\nLounge: definitely need to go and kick with your buddy. there is a lot of girls that you can pick up and if you are a girl there is a lot of guyssss.

He replied that pretty much everything on the menu is made with MSG, and gave me a few options that would work. This is really puzzling to me. MSG is typically a substitute for quality ingredients, and a cheap way to add flavor-what is it doing in $30 a plate Kung Pao Chicken? I wasn't overly thrilled with the selection offered to me, and ended up ordering sushi. $90 (for just me!!!) and a not very full stomach later I was wishing I had just ordered some white rice and grabbed some pizza or something on the strip. The sushi place up the street from my house is better (and better priced). None of my friends' meals looked spectacular either; I felt like I was at an overpriced PF Chang's.

Fortunately, our luck didn't just run out there.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers and four main course dishes and were pleasantly surprised with the quality and the quantity.  The scallops were amazingly tasty, and the peking duck rolls were beyond my expectations.  Our entrees were pad thai, a red curry chicken, a sea bass, and salmon over udon noodles.  All dishes were exceptionally prepared and the thai dishes were better than you'd find at most specialty thai restaurants.  Impressive.  Five stars would be awarded if our server had been more attentive and perhaps if the price were just a smidge lower.  Dinner ended up running a little long and we were antsy to get over to our Cirque du Soleil show.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we left as a happy group and were extremely glad we stopped in.  I'll definitely be making another reservation the next time I'm in town.  \n\nBonus: the other perk of eating there for dinner was that we were able to get stamps to return later in the evening for their must-see club experience.  The stamps saved us from a huge wait in line and also got us in without a cover charge."

A huge factor in my poor rating for this venue was the lackluster service. I called about 2 weeks in advanced to make a reservation for 7 and we STILL had to wait over 40 minutes for our table to be set. What's the point of making a reservation if we're stuck waiting in the lounge anyway? The hostesses were not very helpful or friendly either. \"Your table will be ready in a few minutes\" turned into a dreadful prolonged standstill in our evening. I have the slightest feeling they dragged it out intentionally just to entice us to order drinks in the lounge, but we did not cave.\n\nFinally seated in the nippy upper level right in front of an overpowering AC system, us poor gals decked out in Vegas-appropriate dresses shivered as well browsed through the menu. The fish clay pot I had my eyes set on was taken off the menu, so I played it safe and ordered the black peppered filet mignon w/ udon once again. It took me a while to regain the sensation in my tongue from the blazing hot flavor, but the rest of my friends thought it was pretty tasty. The miso glazed Chilean seabass was one of the best dishes at the table. Who knew such a thick, buttery, succulent filet accompanied by a pile of spinach could be so worthy of drooling-status. \n\nI still think the prices are overpriced for what you're getting. $18 for fried rice is just flat out absurd. The only reason we decided to dine here was to get stamped for the nightclub so we could pass up the entire line with free cover. Smart idea if you plan on dancing the night away at Tao, but after this experience, I'd much rather scout for VIP passes on the strip or find a promoter for a hook up.\n\nPS: Don't forget to bring floss if you order the black pepper filet mignon. I walked out front door with black specks all over my teeth. Hawtness."

I understand that the restaurant was busy but expected that if the wait was that long (with a reservation) that the host would let us know. \n\nOnce we were seated we decided to let the waiter (who had been there for 5 years) decide how we would attack the menu. His recommendations were spot on. We started with the spicy tuna tartare on crispy rice (which was tasty but had too much rice for me) and the lobster wontons with shitake ginger broth (wontons were light and the lobster and sauce were rich - delicious). \n\nHe had us move onto sushi and had the Surf and Turf roll and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and Ponzu sauce. The yellowtail has a great balance of flavor and while the surf and turf roll was good, it had almost too many flavors going on. \n\nWe moved onto heartier dishes like the wok-seared New York sirloin (which was good and WAY less expensive than the 12 oz Kobe ribeye our waiter suggested), the Chilean sea bass (he suggested two appetizer portions as opposed to one main which was the same price and we got more fish), and the Buddha's vegetables. All were delicious and the perfect amount of food for the group. \n\nWe finished off with the oversized fortune cookie which came with a fortune for everyone and was fun to share. \n\nOverall it was a fun dining experience as long as your are ok with sharing plates (which i am)."

Are they mostly Asian? If so, the food will be delicious at an appropriate dollar-per-dollar rate. If not, you are either probably getting crappy take out or are about to get food-fleeced.\n\nDon't get me wrong: the cuisine my fellow Bachelor Party-Goers and I had here, from the admirable sea bass to the wasabi crusted filet mignon was incredibly well-executed and tasty. But while I still enjoyed actually eating the meal in a flawlessly decorated room with its truly hip atmosphere, the ever-present knowledge that I could have had everything we ordered for a fraction of the price at many places in the San Gabriel Valley still sunk the experience.\n\nThat's just me though. I think if you're keen on unloading a boatload of money and you also happen to want Asian food in a super-cool environment, Tao could fit the bill.

Bottle service at the club was a total rip off, certainly not worth the 400 bucks.  We had to walk up 3 flights of what was probably the most gross filthy old staircase I've ever seen (in heels!, wtf?). We were seated outside by the bar on these crappy mat-bench things (which were dirty and dusty).  They looked like wrestling mats that you'd see in a high school gymnasium. Also, these gross old hags came over and sat on the bench next to us (they didnt buy a bottle or pay to sit there) and were smoking cigarettes. We had to track down security to ask them to leave. Anyway, the environment was so lame and I was so irritated that I drank waaaay to much (so I wouldn't be aware how badly everything sucked). I blacked out and woke up the next day in my room at the Encore. I was delighted to see that my wallet (and the 3 grand inside it) had been stolen. Being in Vegas with no ID, wonderful, let me tell ya. Needless to say, it was a very disappointing birthday. If you are looking for a special experience, this is not the place.

THEN we get there and wait 1 HOUR before being seated. wtf - how does this happen when you have a reservation. 10, maybe even 20 minutes i can deal with. but a fucking hour??!! ridiculous.\n- then we get our drink coupons and give them to the cocktail waitress. she was a completed bitch. sorry if you hate your job, but its your job. its in the service industry. you're there to serve. ugh.\n\nalthough i enjoyed my meal once i was seated...the waiting thing ruined it for me. its not somewhere i would choose to go back to again. maybe if they offered take out?"

Ordered the Taotini which was excellent n the waitresses serving drinks are hotties!! Had the Chilean Sea Bass for main course which was superb! My wife is veg & ordered a few things off the menu but none of the veg items were good unfortunately. Go with the Chocolate Zen Parfait for dessert....it so rich n delicious! The waiter offered to get us in for free at the Tao nightclub n we didn't even have to wait in line. Totally worth it!"

Recommended toro toro roll and chef roll as apps and the toro (having never had it) was like silk in your mouth. Atmosphere is sexy dark and non invasive. We sat in the mezanine overlooking Buddha. I ordered Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai and my husband ordered the Black Pepper Sizzled Filet with Udon Noodles. We shared both as they each sent your mouth into absolute happiness. After dinner I had the Orient Express Martini for dessert (so delicious) and then we sat and enjoyed a pot of tea before paying the check. Perfect 10 year Anniversary dinner. \nThey also stamped us for the Nightclub which was awesome as the line was at least a mile long.\nWill return for sure!"

However, had our server known that our bar tab alone would have made up for whatever entrees a normal table would have ordered, I think he would have been nicer.\n\nAs soon as the words \"we'll be splitting\" came out, the server rolls his eyes and takes our orders. It was a good 20 minutes before he came back, brought our food in the wrong order, and proceeding to ignore us again. We watched as he visited every table around us, including one with 4 girls who each ate 1 dish and drank water (aka... prob not going to be getting a big check). It got to the point where we asked one of the bussers to see if they could get us another drink.\n\nFood was okay  - got the sea bass and lo mein noodles. Would have tasted better if the service was better... But, perhaps it was a bad night. Regardless... here's my 2 stars"

Our waitress was very friendly, responsive, and timely.\n\nDrinks- Tao-tini..  They were good.  Smooth and wound up putting back quite a few through the dinner.  Didn't really feel the effects so I'm thinking the \"smoothness\" was perhaps just a lack of alcohol.\n\nThere was a chef's tasting menu being offered this night for an unbelievable $55.  Super cheap.  Both the gf and I went with this option.  First course- spicy tuna tartare over crispy rice.  Yum.  She went with the thai stuffed shrimp.  Again yum.\n\nSecond course-  Fried vegetable rice.. eh ok.  She went with the roasted peppers.  Neither of us enjoyed as they were extremely bitter and wound up each only taking two bites.\n\nThird course-  Wasabi crusted filet with tempura onion rings.  Two others at the table also ordered this and theirs was cooked perfect medium.  Unfortunately I ordered the same temperature and was brought a completely rare piece of meat.  After taking the piece back to the kitchen, it returned 5 minutes later completely charred on the outside yet still very much rare on the inside.  I'm not one to send a piece of steak back twice, so I just left it alone.  I finished the 1/2 of my gf's perfectly cooked filet.\n\nFourth course-  Chocolate spring rolls and a citrus dipping sauce.  Very good and very rich.  Juniper apple blossom with vanilla ice cream.  Nothing special, but good none the less.\n\nIf we didn't get such a great deal with the tasting menu, I know my review would be completely different based on my filet mignon not being cooked to order two times, and eventually just giving up on that course.  With that aside, I did enjoy myself and the majority of the meal was very good.... btw... if you order a coffee with Bailey's, it is brought out in a mug large enough to wash your hands."

Food was pretty good to very good.\n\nThere seems to be differences in opinion in the Yelp reviews whether dining at Tao gets you a free pass to get into the Tao Club. My understanding is that if you order an entree then you (males and females) get into the dance club for free. People also seem to have experienced differences in whether they have to leave the restaurant and then stand in a line to get back in, or if they are allowed to go straight in. On the night we were there (Friday), we had to go outside the restaurant and then stand in a somewhat short line to get back in.\n\nA cool place to eat, but there are lots of great places to eat in Vegas, and this place wasn't good enough to make me want to go back."

As for the \"scene,\" Tao pretty much hits the mark.  It is a beautiful restaurant, dimly lit, and plenty of Las Vegas visitors looking for a good time.  As for the food, it was very mediocre.  I will not be returning.  On a busy Saturday night in Las Vegas without a reservation, we waited for our table for about 30 minutes.  Not bad, huh?  Well with the 40 bucks we tipped the hostess to get a table at all, I was expecting to be seated right away.  I want my 40 bucks back! Oh well, live and learn.  On to the food.  Between the two of us we split the chefs special roll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy yellowtail crunchy onion roll, lobster wontons, shishito peppers, vegetable brown fried rice, and edamame.  Sounds like a lot of food, but the portions are small.  This was definitely enough food for us though.  The sushi was really not impressive.  Yes, the fish is fresh, but unless you are ordering sashimi, it is still possible to get a bad roll.  Well, we got three.  The worst was the shrimp tempura roll.  So small! So bland! So boring! Come on, if you are going to list this a chefs speciality, it better be special.  The other two rolls were a little better, but both sitting on top of a heavy mayo sauce that did not taste good.  This is my pet peeve.  Leave off the heavy sauce people! Especially if it tastes like crap.  The lobster wontons were pretty decent, I could only eat one because they were rich, turn your stomach kind of rich- too saucy, too salty, too something.  I will say the vegetable brown fried rice was pretty good.  This \"healthier\" version of fried rice was packed with veggies and had a great flavor, the only downfall here is that it was served to us ice cold.  The best thing at this restaurant by far was the shishito peppers! I swear these should be on every asian restaurant menu.  I cant imagine it is too difficult to roast these bad boys up, but regardless, Tao did a good job here.  If you haven't tried these peppers before, please try them!  I wouldn't steer you in the wrong direction.  Anyway, I may come back to Tao for a drink, but as for food, I will take my sushi/ asian craving elsewhere."

I loved it so much I HAVE to say something!! I'm sorry my review comes 2 months late! \n\nYou walk into this place and it's just swanky and oozed coolness. I love the big Budda and the rest of the decor is funky as well. Loud ambient lounge/chill music could be heard overhead... I was so happy I was wearing a leopard print halter, otherwise I would have felt under dressed here. \n\nCosmos were fantastic! The sushi was excellent too. I have no idea where they fly the sushi in - as we were in the dessert, but it didn't matter it tasted fabulous and fresh! Pan seared Tuna was fantastic, but OMG the  Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass was to DIE FOR- I mean to DIE FOR. I still dream about it 2 months later..... \n\nBathrooms for me were confusing - the doors had a yin icon on one, and a yang on the other. I got to the door and though WTF, I should have kept up with my yoga class and maybe I would know this.... and while I was trying to decide which door I was going to bust through, some chick walked into Yin and I followed her. Later my friends nicely pointed out - had I not had 3 cosmos I might have noticed the female budda outside of the women's room as the clue... oooops who knew?\n\nMy take - this is a MUST visit place for dinner in Vegas. It will not disappoint, but make sure to make a reservation otherwise you will wait a long time! I made mine on open table a few weeks before my trip."

But I'm so sad to say, I felt like it was over-hyped & over-priced.\n\nFirst of all, Tao is probably one of the most sought-after, hot restaurant/clubs on the Vegas Strip. The architecture and decor of the place is absolutely incredible! The beautiful Buddhas, the tubs with rose petals, the scent of incense and the gorgeous Asian artwork is completely the opposite of the uber-modern, loud, well-decked, expensive perfume- & cologne-doused, busy crowd that it attracts, especially on a Saturday night.\n\nOur meal had its high points. A group of 7 of us plus 1 child were there to celebrate my Mom's b-day. We tried to make a reservation earlier in the day, but were told the only one they had available was after 11 p.m. Rather, they said try coming in & waiting for a table, which we took a chance on.\n\nWe waited for about 45 minutes in the bar area for a table on a Saturday night, which isn't bad at all. We ordered some drinks & a few appetizers off what I thought was an app menu while we waited.\n\nBut once we were seated, we got the same exact menu, which is kind of limited. There were enough options & our group had a lot of vegetarians, so everyone was happy.\n\nI wasn't super hungry -- a horrible thing that happens to me when I travel! -- so I wanted to go with something somewhat light. I ordered the Pad Thai w/chicken, which was pricier than most neighborhood Thai restaurants at almost $19, so I had high expectations. Though it came in a really cool dish that was sort-of elevated, it tasted about the same as if I had paid $9 for it at a local spot. And it was completely SMOTHERED with tasteless bean sprouts. I don't mind a few, but I don't want a mouthful with every bite.\n\nI wanted to order the shrimp tempura appetizer, too, but the waiter said you get 2 pieces for $8 which I didn't think was worth it!\n\nThe service was good, tho, and my family enjoyed their meals. My husband said the orange chicken was really good and he would have loved some more. The giant fortune cookie dessert with Happy Birthday all over the plate for my mom was a real treat!!\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I got to experience Tao, but I feel like I was slightly let down. That being said, given the chance, I would go back again & try the sushi. It looked fantastic!!"

What I don't like about this club (where should I begin is more like it):  They let in too many effin' people in this place.  I don't appreciate getting crushed like a sardine or getting dry humped by random strangers on the dance floor.  Just say no to STD's OK?  I'm pretty sure the amount of people on the dance floor violated fire codes.  I couldn't even move for a good ten minutes cuz I was either getting pushed by people trying to get on the dancefloor, people decided to walk by me cuz for some reason there was no other space for them to walk past, or people bumped into me cuz they were trying to dance.  Not my idea of a good time.  The only time I put up with that noise is when I'm seeing my favourite band in the entire world.\n\nI'm sure if you're a girl, you can get in no matter what you're wearing.  Sucks if you're a guy though.  Also some friends we were trying to meet somehow got invited to get on the VIP list but then later they asked them how they got on the list.  We got attitude from a bouncer saying \"You can't bring in a shopping (plastic) bag to the club.\"  OK, well we went shopping before going to your place.  Luckily, my friends had very large purses so they got creative and shoved the bag in that.  Shoot us.  There's no such thing as coat check here I guess.  They really oughta invest in one of those, it's good for business.  \n\nI'm not a fan of hip hop clubs to begin with, but seriously 30 minutes of a SexyBack mash up filled in with clips of various other top 40 of course?  I like a little more variety.  Last time I checked this was Vegas...play something a little more hip.  I went to a club in my boring suburban town that played similar stuff...I guess DJ AM was at this club too perhaps?  I'm sure this place is tons of fun if you arrive early and leave early, but if you get here around midnight or later, forgetaboutit.  No room to dance.  No room to walk.  Get me to the bar for some water please.  Confusing \"EXIT\" signs too.  I had to ask five different staff members how to get out of this joint and I ended up back where I started.  Cover was also $20 which I guess is \"reasonable\" by Vegas standards.  I couldn't even enjoy the cool decor in here because I just wanted to get the eff out of there.  Not my idea of a good time.  I'd rather go shopping here or stay in the hotel.  No club for this party pooper."

It was not crowded as it usually gets. My husband and I sat upstairs and enjoyed our time there.

We ordered family style (many plates in the center of the table to share), and in total, we destroyed 8 delicious dishes and a beautiful dessert smorgasbord. Every single thing we tried was delicious. I am spoiled in that my parents take me to nice places on occasion, and Tao is at the top 5 of my list of best meals I've ever eaten. One friend who ate with us said - and I quote, \"This is probably the best meal I will ever eat in my life.\" I am going to New York this fall or winter and plan to eat at the Tao restaurant in New York with my boyfriend. You can expect to hear another review on that restaurant soon. \n\nMy favorite dishes of the meal we had include: \n- The flavorful 28 days aged new york steak which melted in my mouth\n- The miso glazed Chilean Sea Bass which tasted like it was injected with the best sauce ever created. Every bite gave you a gush of flavor, and it was cooked just right.\n- The Crispy Tuna Sashimi Roll with Edamame which came with a not-too-spicy wasabi dipping sauce.\n- The delicious mixed sashimi platter which had a wide variety of sashimi including fatty tuna. \n- The gorgeous display of desserts (also ordered family style) which came with a hilarious and delicious giant fortune cookie and sweet dipping cream. The fortunes were Vegas-themed and made us laugh. \n\nThe atmosphere was nice and our server, Jeffery, was amazing. He always came at the right time, promptly filled our glasses, and was extremely helpful with the ordering process. He was absolutely hilarious, and super friendly. His language is what puts him over the top. The way he described the food as we were ordering was something from a movie or commercial. He used 2-3 descriptive - and one would even say seductive - adjectives for each dish. It's hard not to order them when he describes them that way. My brother put it best when he asked Jeffery, \"Could you please describe the food to me like that as I'm eating it?\" About a quarter of the way into our meal, the manager even came out to make sure we were all enjoying our food. \n\nAll in all, it was a perfect dinner, and a fantastic way to start our crazy night at the Electric Daisy Carnival."

We stayed at the Venetian and thought it looked like a fabulous place.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful.  There are tubs filled with flowers as you walk in.  The decor is really pretty and there is a huge Buddah statue in the restaurant.\n\nThey have a nice sized menu.  I would have given them 5 stars but there were a couple of things I found weird.  I am a vegetarian and told this to the waiter.  He helped me out by telling me what was safe to eat.  There was a side of broccoli and he told me it was made with chicken stock.  The food tasted freshly prepared (which for the price I would hope it is) so I don't really understand why the dish could not be made vegetarian as other restaurants do for me.  I ended up ordering vegetable fried rice and asked if they could add pineapple because I saw they used it in another dish.  The waiter told me he could ask but was not sure the chef would do it.  They did not as he tried to make a nice gesture and brought me some raw pineapple on the side when my rice came out.  Again, I think it is weird that the chef would be so rigid.\n\nOther than that I have to say the food was delicious.  My rice was very good.  The vegetable dumplings were so good we got a second order. The vegetable sides I was able to order were tasty.  My husband had a pepper steak dish and said other than some peppers being overwhelming was good as well.  \n\nDuring the reservation we were asked if we were celebrating anything so we let them know we came to Vegas to get married.  They did bring us a surprise dessert which was a great gesture.  It was a huge fortune cookie that when cracked open contained what tasted like both a chocolate and a vanilla mousse.  Whatever it was, it was adorable and tasted very nice.  I did enjoy the experience and the food and would love to eat here again next time I visit Vegas."

Reservation was for 7pm but we arrived 10 minutes early and grabbed a cocktail at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party. Ended up being seated closer to 7:30 which was fine because we were enjoying both our cocktails and the conversation at the bar.\n\nAs stated in an earlier review, we got the skinny waiter with glasses who looked like Dave Chapelle. In short he was an awesome waiter and made our experience that much better.  Had one member of our party who was a vegetarian and he went out of his way to explain all the vegetarian options available to her.\n\nHad the Chilean Sea Bass and tofu lettuce wraps for apps and they were fantastic. The sea bass was definitely my favorite.\n\nFor my entree I went with the wasabi encrusted filet mignon with a side of giant onion rings. Cooked to perfection and an excellent choice. \n\nWill definitely head back here on future Vegas visits."

It is very very obvious that their waiters want to squeeze as much money out of you as possible.  I understand that people need to make money & waiters want you to order more. Go ahead and make that money, But there has to be a balance that waiters don't cross or else it will be TOO obvious & the customer will give you a 10% tip of the slightly bigger check instead of the 20% they were planning to give if the guy acted like what he was suppose to be, a good waiter.  \nWhen we sat down, we were offered 2 choices of water, both of which they charge for.  The option of bottled water is normal for \"high class\" restaurants everywhere, but it's the a-hole way of wording & tone that pisses you off.  My group of 6 didn't care for the bottled water because we were all ordering cocktails & beers anyways.  So we said \"Just normal tab water is fine\".  A BIG frown on Davy's face, and raises his voice in a mocking tone & says \"In Las Vegas, no one will give you tab water.\"  HAHA, a big freakin joke or what?  Couple of us in the group comes to vegas about 5 times a yr for business with the company.  We've been to more than a few trendy restaurants in the 5 star properties.  We went to Shibuya at MGM just 2 nights before, we had a CHOICE of bottled or tab. \n\nD\u00c9COR - If you've been to trendy restaurants in LA or NY, there is nothing special about this place.  Don't get pulled in by the hype that the promoters try to put onto the place.  \n\nFOOD - Onto the food selection, Davy tells us \"Its my job to explain the menu to you and I'll be HONEST with you, these are my favorites\" & proceeds to point out the 2 most expensive items on each section of the menu.  As he was doing that, we were just looking at each other like ... look at this clown.  We ordered what we wanted ourselves, again Davy's service starts getting worse.  All the food were very normal, nothing bad, nothing special.\n\nCHECK - When we were done, Davy comes over & said \"You guys have to get desert, everybody's doing it\" What a pathetic half joke half pressure line.  We passed on it.  When he brings the check, we find that its more than what it was suppose to be.  On a closer look, he charged us for the price of entrees for 2 orders when we ordered appetizers.  Davy insisted that he gave us the entrees which we wouldn't know because the portions were all small.  Even if he did, it was his mistake when he took the order as we honestly all heard our friends order the appetizer.  Again, crooks.  \n\nThere are PLENTY of nice trendy restaurant/club in Vegas, try any of those.  Don't be sucker & go because of the \"hype\" like we did."

I was hoping it would be somewhat of a glorified PF Changs. I ordered the filet dish, however it was the most disgusting thing I have ever had. It was way too salty. They drowned the filet in black bean sauce. It was as if they had poured an entire jar of black bean sauce right over it. I wanted to finish my $80+ meal and plus I was hungry, but I could NOT get myself to swallow it was so salty. My friend ordered the kung pao chicken. She was gagging because it was so salty. We also ordered a side of chinese broccoli. How can you go wrong with gai lan?? Again it was drenched in oyster sauce. We hardly touched our food because it was so disgusting. I am not exaggerating when I say you can get better tasting food from Panda Express. Meanwhile we overheard one of the gentlemen sitting at the next table going on and on about how great his Kung Pao Chicken was. I guess we all have our opinions and he obviously does not have any tastebuds. \nDon't go here. Food is disgustingly salty. Spend your money at the buffet instead.\nI noticed that Vegas steak houses tend to make their steak extremely salty as well. Maybe it's a Vegas thing?"

Both dishes were absolutely amazing.  When I think of Asian food and beef, I think tough and overcooked.  The filet was so tender and flavorful.  Right after I ordered it, I was regretting my decision thinking that it was going to be mundane and that I should have gone for something more adventurous, but the dish had wonderful complex flavors that took it way beyond what you would think a beef and noodle dish would be.  The sea bass was so flavorful.  I have tried chilean sea bass many times before, and I have always been put off by the flavor.  This was done right, the miso glaze was amazing.\n\nOur drinks were great, our party of four all selected different cocktails so we could sample each others drinks.  All of them were delicious.  My favorite was the Tao Love Potion #9. \n\nFor desert we shared the giant fortune cookie filled with white chocolate and dark chocolate mouse with fresh fruit.

Word to the wise: TAO = a place where the customer is always wrong.\n\nHere's the skinny: we dined 11 deep Saturday evening while in town celebrating my 32nd birthday. It's Memorial Day weekend and expected to be a madhouse in Vegas, so I made every precaution to secure reservations, be on time for said reservations and ensure my entire party was on time with me. I may not be Kim Kardashian, but perhaps the manager failed to note that my reservation was made by someone who works directly with them and asked for my party to be taken care of. I'm also assuming they didn't know that I am a celebrity publicist in LA and have sent numerous clients to spend thousands of dollars at their establishment. Maybe if this was noted my party would have received better service. \n\nFood: my boyfriend and I split the chicken dumplings, the spicy yellowtail sushi roll and the chicken pad thai. More than enough food! The pad thai seemed to be in a never-ending bowl! It alone would have fed the 2 of us easily. The dumplings were the best choice out of our order. Fresh, steamed and flavorful. I only wish there were more in an order! The roll was good, but nothing special. My friend had the BBQ pork and it was phenomenal. I'd look into that if BBQ meats are your thing. The pad thai was pretty standard. It was also good but nothing to write home about. Nonetheless, I was pleased with the overall good experience. The crowning glory was the giant fortune cookie that was sent out for my birthday (it is filled with both vanilla and chocolate cream - oh hey ying yang!) - which was the only good move by the restaurant the entire meal.\n\nThe service: this is where things get rough. We sat down for our 8:30pm reservation around 8:45pm. We didn't mind the 15 minute wait. We're a large party and it's Saturday night - reservations can take some time. I get it. We sat down and didn't see a waitress for nearly 20 minutes. When she finally came by the table she took our drink order and bounced for another 20 minutes or so. My friend asked for an iced tea that 40 minutes later had never made it's way to the table. When we asked about it, the waitress took another 15 minutes to bring it claiming that they had to \"brew a new pot\". Ok. Then when we were an hour and a half into our dinner order waiting for more beverages the waitress was M.I.A. We finally called over the manager and asked if we could please get some drinks (one of which had already been ordered and never brought to the table). His response was \"what? Are you trying to get something free out of this?\". I'm sorry? No. We are trying to get our drinks and spend more money in your establishment. Wow. The next epic failure of this restaurant/nightclub comes from the security guard/staff. My boyfriend got up from the table to take a work related call. It was noisy inside so he stepped outside to take it. When he came back in a security guard grabbed him by his shirt and said \"where do you think you're going?! Get in line!\" To which my boyfriend responded - \"I've been sitting with a table of 11 for nearly 2 hours. I just stepped outside to take a call.\" The guard then responded \"yeah right\" and grabbed him by his shirt collar. When he turned around to radio someone my boyfriend just yanked himself free and walked inside. The final straw was when the waitress asked if we'd like to divide the tab. We said yes and tried to be fair by making a few groups so as not to create 11 separate checks for her. Tik-tok - 1 hour later (literally) she plopped down the checks with a look of irritation and left. \n\nTotal time in restaurant (due to slow service) - 3.5 hours!! It was nearly midnight when we finally left!\n\nThe club was hopping but we were not interested in that. We just wanted a nice dinner in what seemed to be only a mildly busy restaurant. A party of 11 would have left a much bigger tip had the service been respectable. I get that everyone wants to dine here, but that doesn't mean you have to stop creating a great customer experience for those choosing your restaurant. There are MANY other options."

At first glance, Tao's eastern Buddhist inspired atmosphere was inviting, warm, and unique despite the men in black that guarded the entrance. Even on a Tuesday night, the dining room was almost full with late 20s- 30s casual business class patrons. Our host and waiter were efficient though and we were seated right away. So, 4 stars for the ambience and courteous staff!!\n\nFood: We ordered a spicy tuna avocado roll and Singaporean noodle paired with tap water, of course. The spicy tuna avocado roll was good, but nothing spectacular for its $17 price tag. The Singaporean noodle ($26! oh shit! ka-ching!) was dry, cold, and boasted of flavors from the far-east...just kidding, more like flavors from the Costco frozen aisle. Since it was my bff's birthday, they gave us a delicious complimentary dessert, which was the best part of the meal...and i would come back here just for that. The dessert was creatively presented as a giant fortune cookie, decked with a lining of chocolate almonds atop a bed of vanilla and chocolate mouse and surrounded by fresh fruits. The \"fortune cookie\" is really a crunchy crepe, which was not too sweet and just the right price (free!). \n\nWe were definitely disappointed with this meal overall, but still had an awesome time because the crowd and waiters were fun! If you want to dress up, but not to the fancy extent of Picasso or Joel Robunchon (umm...completely different price range lol), you might want to check this place out. We might try this place again, but next time opt for their entrees instead."

Keep in mind we did have reservations! It was so crowded we couldn't even walk or find a place to sit. There were constantly employees telling you to move so they could escort people up to the nightclub. I would not waste my time here. There are plenty of other great places in the area with less people."

            "review": "My husband and I were regular visitors to Las Vegas. And we did not visit Las Vegas without having a diner, even sometimes even going for 2 diners during a weekend. That is how much we liked this restaurant. To celebrate my husband s birthday I booked a table for saturday night, weekend in December, very clearly mentionning that it was to celebrate a birthday at the moment of reservation. I was looking forward to having the duck dish. We started off with the lychee cocktail. It was not to our liking. Very strong and it had no taste of lychee. Just a very strong taste of alcohl. My husband asked for more juice and the juice supposidly , lychee tasted more like DETERGENT !!  nothing to do with what we had previously in Tao.\nNext came the duck dish, it was just lookwarm, nearly cold. obviously heated dish maybe in the micro wave  I cannot tell you how dissapointed we were. We are both hard working people and this dish was expensive, no problem if it had been delicious as I remembered it to be previously. We were expecting a desert with a candle, nothing of the sorts !! We ordered a desert, received  it but still no candle. \nThen to top the evening, the young lady, our waitress, was very cockey, nearly rude, She had absolutely no idea of what customer service meant. No idea. I called the manager and he asked : what can I do for you??? NOTHING.\nJUST TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT TAO IS NOT THE SAME PLACE THAT I ENJOYED GOING TO.  I am so sorry to have to write this, we will NEVER go back. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT.\nWe passed the bar on our way out, on a Saturday night it always was full, this time it was nearly empty, TAO must have LOST a lot of their customers."

I'm not much of a fish eater, but the seabass was sooo goood. However,  I recommending getting two if you have a large group and doing family style. The portions here are fairly small, but the quality of the food is high.  \n\nService gets five stars as well. The first time I came here, we sat upstairs- more secluded and private. The waitress came everytime my glass was half full and refilled my drink for me and asked if we needed anything else. The 2nd time we came here, it was extremely busy and we sat downstairs. Again, the service was GREAT! The waiter came back and filled up my water so much I told him to put the pitcher on the table :) \n\nHeads up: I would hold off on the drinks unless you are drinking WINE with your dinner. We got a few signature cocktails and they were all average. Also, it kind of ruins the taste of the food."

We were EXHAUSTED and grabbing the redeye a few hours later back to Boston.\n\nLet's say this first: every restaurant in Vegas over-salts their food, because it's part of the bigger plan to drink your face off.  Knowing this, I can't really complain about how salty the food was (which it was), because that's just sort of the foundation that Vegas sets for you.\n\nMy coworker and I shared steamed dumplings, a sushi roll, and an order of the pad thai chicken.\n\n...it was all REALLY delicious.  I was honestly pretty shocked.  I come to Vegas about 4 times a year for work, and I've managed to eat at my fair share of restaurants on the Strip.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.\n\nWe also got an excellent table in the back of the room, but I think that's because a coworker called ahead to her contact at Tao for us, since she'd done a reception there recently.  Not sure if that affected our service, but the waiter was very friendly and chatty."

Honestly, the service is what took this place to a 5 for me. Our waiter was named Zeban (?) and he was really helpful on suggesting dishes and pacing our food. He even held back on the last order (Some Spring rolls) until we were sure we wanted them. He was right. it was one too many dishes. Here are a few highlights- Lobster Won tons were great. BBQ pork was so so as was the Sliced Steak. Crispy Tuna Tartare Sushi was amazing, as was the Sea Bass Satay. The Udon noodles with BBQ Salmon was cooked to perfection, but I was expecting a Soup type Udon and this was a large piece of Salmon next to a pile of noodles. The star of the night was the Peking Duck served MuShu style. Wine list was good and wine service was very good. I liked that Zeban knew his stuff. Nothing worse than a waiter that has no clue what the wines taste like. The sake list was really great too,. We had the giant Fortune Cookie for dessert, which was a kick. It was a super fresh fortune cookie filled with white and chocolate mousse, and served with fresh fruit. Yum.It came with 4 fortunes in it, which was a fun way to end dinner. \nFinally, a warning: Yin= Ladies Room and Yang = Men's Room. 2 men walked into the ladies while we were in there. The restroom attendant (love that touch, so old school) said it happens all the time..."

The Buddhist iconography and kanji gave a mostly Chinese feel.  The restrooms were clean, but unfortunately had an attendant.  The restaurant was very crowded and popular, especially around the stairs leading to the (disappointing) nightclub.  I loved our table; it was a cozy and comfortable booth, but was near the kitchen so my coat was repeatedly knocked off my chair.\n\nOur waitress that evening was perfect; friendly, efficient, and nice.  We had the filet mignon; it was succulent and I enjoyed lightly cooking each piece.  I enjoyed a beer and tea with dinner.  The host staff was funny and made me feel like our comfort was tantamount.  \n\nThe conversation was the best part of dinner, while people watching and taking in the ambiance.

            "review": "What a pretentious yet tasteful dungeon this was ! I got the feeling that the reason this place is so pricey besides the fact that it is in Vegas, and in the Venetian, is because they are still trying to profit and pay off whoever did their decor. It was unique, but I was not impressed because I see this stuff around all the time (hey, I AM from Los Angeles, the cultural enclave of the west coast).\nThe decor is the highlight of eating here, not the food or the service. It is definitely no bargain. The selection of food is not sufficient. There is no description of the special rolls, which confused my companions and made me have to explain the differences to them -__-. The sushi was not well wrapped, or proportioned well. I did like the idea of a seaweed salad sampler plate for a measly $10, but the dipping sauce was bland and watery, and they just didn't go well together or alone. I'd rather go to a white box with windows for good food rather than try and fill my stomach through looking at cool things, but that is just me.\nI had a Love Potion #9 cocktail, and though it was good, it was a ripoff. Maybe I hit the bad bartender who gives too much ice and not enough of anything else, but it was a necessary gamble. \nThe service was fine, no complaints here. I actually ended up waiting less time than I thought I would have to. I also got the feeling that you have to be less than a size 6 to work at this place, including the men. Abercrombie/Fitch style lawsuit, anyone? \nThe music the DJ was spinning from ITUNES wasn't hip or amazing, it was just typical background music. I wouldn't dance to it, nope. \nAt least you can look around at other places you should have eaten after you eat here, since the Grand Canal shopping area is right here."

Upon entry, we noticed tubs filled with water and rose petals...to which my wife replied, Can we get in? I told her, sure ;) It also created an intoxicating scent...or perhaps that was the drinks?\n\nOur table was nicely situated on the second level which overlooked the giant Buddah and coy fish pond. This was a great location since it was above the group tables noise and was quiet enough to have a decent conversation of sweet-nothings and what-nots. My wife also pointed out from this vantage point, you can see down some girls tops...I resisted to look as I felt I was being tested.\n\nOur server, Michael, was tremendously helpful with our dining experience. His fantastic recommendations with the sashimi, the vegetarian selections, and the strong, yet fine Tao cocktails were spot on.\n\nI also liked how the other staff members went the extra mile in making the dining experience special. Our water glasses were always full, and empty dishes were promptly removed. They also gave us a line pass for the nightclub upstairs. This was great in avoiding the long lines even as they opened at 10pm.\n\nAnother helpful TIP is the Yin/Yang signage on the restroom doors. Here's a helpful primer...\n\nYin = Feminine forces\nYang = Masculine forces\n\nClever, huh?\n\nThis took my wife and I awhile to figure out, especially after a few drinks. They even included male and female statues...and the occasional male attendant peeping out from time to time...to help the confused or drunkards.\n\nIt is a bit on the expensive side but well worth it. Overall, we enjoyed Tao so much and found ourselves craving the food the next day. I'm sure we'll be back."

The tartare was very good except for the fact that being rolled in rice then flour and deep fried it totally covered the taste of the tartare. It was good because it was fried perfectly. The octopus salad was a total miss with overly acidic dressing and almost no octopus. The Chilean sea bass was the best fish I've ever tasted, absolutely delicious except for the fact it looked like it was just thrown over some vegetables.

            "review": "Not impressed.\n\nI was very excited for this restaurant, amidst all the hype and reviews.  The big buddha especially was appealing.  We considering just popping by for the club at first, but decided we may as well just eat here instead.  Boy do I regret that.\n\nFirst, the service.  For a high-scale, populous, touristy area such as where Tao is located, I would except only the best of service.  This started on the wrong foot, when my party was running 15 minutes late, and called out of politeness to notify and apologize to the restaurant like we always do.  Here's a first:  when I asked if our reservation could be pushed back by 15 minutes due to a slight delay, the hostess replied, \"15 minutes should be okay.. any later, and it's up to the manager's discretion on your reservation.\"  What?  What kind of BS rudeness is this.  I can understand that for a top-notch restaurant, space is limited and therefore any outrageously late reservations / no shows will be given to people who have been waiting for a seat.  But we were only 15 minutes late, and by the time we arrived, there was no one waiting in line.  That just added salt to the wound - if there had been an extremely long line with multiple aggravated parties waiting to be seated, sure.  But don't spout some BS to us over the phone and cause us to rush when it wasn't even needed with a passive aggressive threat to our reservation.  Also, during my reservation, we had requested a seat next to the large Buddha.  Granted, I understand requests are not always given, but it was for my girlfriend's graduation dinner, and the fact that there were empty seats around the Buddha when we passed by it made me wonder what exactly the manager does when training his employees on the ideals of service.  Nevertheless, we spoke up when they attempted to seat us in some dark corner, and waited while the hostess \"discussed\" with another our seating preferences, and reseated us after 2-3 minutes.  \n\nMoving on, the decor.  They get an additional star for this, otherwise this would have been a one-star review.  As a tourist, we love seeing flashy, new things - my camera is always ready in my hand.  First, they had multiple beautiful rose petal water baths in the entrance (for visual pleasure of course).  The light was dimly set, but not dark enough where you can't see a thing due to the illuminations of all the other decor.  Aside from the various Asian inspired ornaments we saw, the Big Buddha was again the most appealing factor of this restaurant.  Definitely bring a camera if you're the type who wants to see things like this - it'll be one of your only high points of the night.\n\nThird, food.  Meh.  PF Changs puts the same amount of flavor, for 1/3 of the price.  It's basically just heavy MSG foods with some fancy names, and more expensive types of food such as lobster.  I won't go too deep into what we had, but our party had a variety of different types ranging from sushi rolls to lobster to fish.  The fish was the best - it was flaky, with a great texture and the right amount of sauce.  Everything else fell far below my expectations.  \n\nFourth, price.  Ugh.  $35-$40 per entree.  And I feel as if I could get most of this from my local chinese take-out, minus some expensive stuff like lobster.  However, just because you offer a few expensive dishes doesn't mean you can charge premium price.  If the taste isn't there, it's not worth it.  If the service is subpar, it's not worth it.  I would have been fine with Tao, possibly giving it 3-4 stars, if these dishes are maximum $20.  But for what we got - a rehash of what we could get anywhere else, for up to $40+?  Hell no.\n\nSummary:  Unless you really need to fill your tourist bucket list and see the Big Buddha, avoid this place."

They made us wait til everyone was there to be seated even when we had 3/4 of the group there and we had a show to make.\n\nBut once seated, service was fast and friendly. Drinks are yummy, and they did them up right, even when when I gave them my funky vodka mojito order that makes most waiters scratch their head.\n\nThe food seemed tastier the first time around, nothing quite impressed like a year ago. Maybe Tao is getting a little old or my taste buds sharper, not quite sure. The filet is still yummy and dumplings were pretty good but everything else was okay. One must-try, their dessert doughnuts...definitely a win-win.\n\nI probably wouldn't return a third time, Tao was fun, but it's had its 15 minutes of fame in my Vegas...there are too many other new places to try in whirlwind Vegas!!"

            "review": "This was my first visit here, for my birthday, definitely felt like a celebrity, seeing as though all the celebrities do eat here.  My girls made reservations for us, they did so good.  We were a tad bit late, but the hostess was nice enough to seat us within a good 15 minutes.  That was really sweet of her, because the place was packed, and I'm sure that's nothing new.\n\nOnce we were seated, our waiter, I hate that I forgot his name, greeted all of the ladies with a smile, told us all about the specials, what's popular, all that good stuff to help us decide.  The restaurant was very dim, very dark, very sexy.  Honestly, it was a little too dark, made it very difficult to read the menu, but that was nothing big to complain about.  Because it was a group of girls, we all made the executive decision to order 3 or 4 appetizers, 3 or 4 dinner entrees, make it like family style.  Pass everything around the table, everyone gets to taste everything.  Now, I don't know if I got my hopes too high up for Tao, but the overall meal, it was...good. Not great, but good.  I wasn't disappointed, but I guess I was expecting out-of-this World cuisine.  \n\nHonestly, the best things, were the Thai Crab Cakes and the Pork Potstickers.  Full of flavor, full of filling, the mango chili sauce on the crab cakes was really good, so was the chili sesame glaze on the potstickers.  That was my favorite.  Now, the entrees, it's not like they were bad, but I wasn't blown away.  If I had to pick one of my favorites, it would have to be the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon.  Cooked perfectly, tender, flavor was awesome and the tower of onion rings were a great match. A fun match.  I ordered the Miso Glazed Sea Bass, which melted in my mouth like butter, tender and flaky, but the seasoning was a little off.  It's like there wasn't enough.  But the quality was top notch.\n\nIt was so sweet that they did bring me this giant fortune cookie, with a giant fortune on the inside, filled with sweet, smooth, velvety vanilla and chocolate mouse.  I mean it was so good and the cookie was just the cutest and so delicious.  The fresh fruit with the chocolate, I mean it was literally a sweet ending.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Tao, it is definitely the place to be, always jumpin', always poppin' and it's really just a pretty cool place!"

            "review": "Have been here several times & I will come here again & again just for the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ...it is sooo good!  Just melts in your mouth.  Thai Fish Hot Pot with Lobster, Scallops, Shrimp, Squid and Clams also great.  Hong Kong Xo Shrimp with Long Beans and Jasmine Rice is good, but I have had better.  The Japanese Seaweed Salad Sampler is okay...I guess I don't like seaweed that much.  Martinis also yummy...had a watermelon martini which was refreshing.\n\nService is fast, great.  Decor is great...get a 2nd floor table on the edge for a great view of the giant buddha...hey, there is a koi pond under there!!  (Didn't notice my first time here).  \n\nHighly recommend before coming to Vegas or when in Vegas...call for reservations!  Or expect a very long wait, dinner @ 11:30 pm or forget about eating there that night.  This last weekend we were there & settled for an early dinner due to their anniversary celebration & with the with likes of P. Diddy there that night...getting in at any other time would have been impossible.  Also pricey, but hey it is Vegas."

The lychee martini was nothing like the one I have tasted in New York I couldn't even drink it all. And the service here was awful. We felt as we were being rushed the whole time and we asked for more salt for the edamame and it never came. The food was very good but that's about it. The experience was not great, and dining out is not just about the food but the experience in general. Super disappointed."

Service was very slow and we were there for about 3 hours (mind you this was Asian fusion and not a 7-course french tasting menu).   Our waiter left out parts of our order (the sides), but this was rectified in a fairly timely manner.   Appetizers and sushi were the highlights of the meal.   We went to the nightclub after dinner (you can ask for a stamp during dinner that will then waive your cover,  but they do make you go downstairs and wait in a line in order to get in to the club ... you can't just enter from the dining  area, although this would be physically possible ).   Food and service are average, likely busy due to the hype and that it is currently trendy.   Not sure how this place will do long term.    It was fine, but it is unlikely that I would return on future trips to Vegas."

Lots of spicy, hot flavors from chili and wasabi.  This is drinking food.\n\nIf you must have sushi, top props to the spicy lobster roll with black tobiko, king crab California roll (made with real king crab), and the crispy soft shell crab roll served with a yuzu mayonnaise.  All are familiar just made with top quality ingredients and a good flavor twist that makes you long for a second bite.\n\nSmall plate standouts include an unexpectedly good grilled Chilean sea bass served with a satay sauce. Never thought what is essentially peanut butter would go so well with fish.  The Thai crab cakes with mango chili sauce while not purely crab meat just pairs so well with the sauce.  Well balanced.  The spicy tuna tartar on crispy rice crackers, a great twist on the classic.  Outstanding.  Bold flavor, cool tuna, crispy rice cracker.  So much contrast make for a delicious bite of food.  Finally the  kobe beef sashimi with fresh wasabi; yum.\n\nDo not pass on the Peking duck spring roll with hoisin sauce or the lobster and shrimp spring roll with spicy pineapple sauce.  Big bold flavors.  Textual contrast at its best.\n\nFinally, if you never had avocado tempura try it.  The warm avocado has the creamy texture of uni.  Very different.  Very good.\n\nNote:  Dining at Tao should be social so bring a group of friends.  The food is meant to be shared.  \n\nSpecial note:  For the guys, dining at Tao does not give you any special VIP privileges to enter the Tao nightclub later in the evening.  Ladies, work the magic.\n\n\nRecommended."

Its trendy...its spendy...its a mad frenzy...and its probably the best spot to have \"dinnertainment\" (thats right Yelpers...I invent words!) in Vegas. The spectacle of the huge Buddha seemingly floating above the koi fish pool is unreal (makes you wonder how they got that big bastard in the building) and awe-inspiring. The lounge and bar are like a social scene all in itself. The multiple dining areas (downstairs, sushi bar, upstairs) all have their own vibe about them meaning you get a different experience everytime you dine there. The food...well its just goes without saying that its f&*^^in great. The sushi, the thai, the chinese...everything is as tasty as can be. And hell yes its expensive...but your in Vegas...so deal with it. You can to have fun, dine and party like a rockstar, so do it and enjoy. The service is absolutely top caliber and just adds even more to the experience. For a non-Vegas person, I eat here and party here everytime Im out there (I should be a spokesperson for the freakin place) and will continue to do so as long as its there.\nPS...Reservations definitely the way to go unless you have the Vegas Passport (know someone that works here)."

It's pretty (although the Buddha Bar thing is a bit \"done\" now). The food, however, is consistent with other Panda Express reviews. I figured that it would be more P.F. Chang's but I was wrong. PFC is not really Chinese either, it's Amero-chinese and they do a good job of it. TAO is totally mall Chinese. I can be OK with mall Chinese. Two meats, a veg and some noodles for $10? Great! One meat for $25? Not so much. To make matters worse, it's generally pretty bland for the sugared-up type of Chinese food that this tries to be.\n\nIf you're into the Buddha Bar looks of the early 2000's, this is great. Otherwise, go elsewhere if you care about food."

We had a reservation but had to sit at the bar for over 20 minutes before we were seated. The place was super loud (people and music) and when we were seated, we were barely an arms-length away from the next table over. Our server(s) - we had a few rotating in/out (maybe it was the switch over time?) - were pleasant but seemed rushed and stressed throughout the meal. \n\nThe food was mediocre and arrived overly quickly... We definitely felt rushed. We each had something different - variety of fish, meat and chicken - but each dish was overly salty and oily. The portions were fine but lacking flare and flavor. I also didn't like how we \"had\" to order main dishes in order to be able to access the nightclub. I was much more interested in ordering two appetizers but my evening plans got in the way!\n\nThe cocktails were fun and the wine list impressive. The bar at the front of the restaurant has a great atmosphere - I'd come back for drinks anytime.  I'd probably also come back for dinner because, after all, it's Vegas and you're here to have some fun in loud and busy places! \n\np.s. In case you didn't know: the entrance to the restaurant has bath tubs which have both rose petals and barely clothed women soaking in them! It's a surprise and a unique experience!"

You enter into a large open dark area with lounge style seating. We got a nice private room that overlooked into the rest of the dining area. We had about 15 people in our party and spent over $1000 including tax and tip. So this was an expensive restaurant nonetheless. It was a different twist on modern i would say. I ordered the appetizer butter fish which was skewered on wood and came with virtually uncooked and earthy tasting fresh asparagus. The butterfish was cooked just right with the perfect sweet fish flavor. The sweet glaze on the butterfish was delish as well. I ordered a bowl of brown rice which they charged $5 for. I think they pride themselves in the presentations of their dishes. Their bathrooms are quite unique as you walk into the hallway and see these boy pictures and think taht you are going into a male bathroom and then you find two doors with each with a similar statue next to them, but no inscription as to which is male or female. Talk about Russian Rulet. I won't spoil it. I ended up waiting for someone to come out of one of them before i chose the right bathroom."

None of the reception area checked on us or anything, the only attention was from \"security\" guys managing flow by the door, telling us to get out of the way. \nI know it may have been extra busy since Kim K was celebrating her b-day there, but we had booked long before that became public and no matter what goes on you should be able to manage your customers just the same. It was a bit of a mood killer among my group since we felt in the way and not welcomed....Not to mention waiting so long took the wind out of our sails for the evening.\nOne redeeming thing is that they brought over some complimentary shots and appetizers to munch on, since we were all starved after our wait.\nThe food was what to be expected, tasty but not worth the crowds and the hassle.

For the first course, my friend ordered the Satay chicken with peanut sauce.  I got the \"crunchy spicy yellowtail roll with spicy mayonnaise.\" We both enjoyed our dishes.  We didn't try each others dishes because Paula doesn't eat sushi and satay chicken is just satay chicken.  I did try the peanut sauce and it was good.\n\nFor course two, Paula got the roasted Thai Buddha chicken with choy sum, sweet chili, and lime.  I got the filet mignon pepper steak with shitake mushroom, bell pepper, and shishito peppers.  I did have some of the Buddha chicken and it was very tender and the sauce was excellent.  The pepper steak was very good.  The filet was sliced and barely stir fried with the vegetables.  The stand out was the sauce again!  It was rich and very flavorful.\n\nFor dessert, we again took different paths.  Paula got the crispy Fuji apple blossoms with Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream and I got the chocolate spring rolls\n with Kalamansi dipping sauce.  The rolls were good but they weren't stuffed with chocolate as I hoped they would be.  Rather, there was some melted chocolate on a leaf and the rolls were placed on the chocolate.  Regardless, they were good.  The dipping sauce was non-descript.  I really couldn't say it had much of a flavor.  It tasted more like mango than orange.  For Paula's apple blossoms, they were triangle puff pastries with apple filling.  They were good.\n\nService was very good.  My iced tea was refilled when it got halfway down.  The table was bussed quickly.  Our server was very pleasant and he was pleased to know there was at least one local having dinner at Tao.\n\nThe room is quite nice.  Dark and woody with a large Buddha in the center along one wall.  We got our cameras/phones out so we could get a photo of it.  It would be a good place to take a date if you wanted to impress.\n\nI can only can fit in two places for this Restaurant Week, and I'm glad Tao was one of them!"

From the giant Buddha statue in the center to the layout and d\u00e9cor of the overall restaurant, this is something that will satisfy any diner regardless of their past dining experiences anywhere else.  The food is absolutely amazing with portion sizes that are moderate in size and not small.  The menu was diverse and offered something for everyone.  I wasn't so sure of this spot at first as I was pretty hungry, but I left highly satisfied.  \n\nI ordered this fried coconut shrimp dish. It was an absolute delight and was more filling than I expected.   I did not expect so many shrimp and so I was both surprised and delighted at the portion size.  It was cooked well and good not have tasted better.  \n\nThe d\u00e9cor of the restaurant was very tasteful and trendy.  This is an Asian fusion restaurant and so it was a fusion of Asian styling with modern trendiness.  This is a solid choice for any type of occasion, whether it be a date or just dinner with friends.  They even have booths near the front for more romantic types.  \n\nOne final note about this spot was how amazing our waiter was.  He was extremely knowledgeable about the food and one of the friendliest servers I have ever had.  It was my birthday a few days before and he surprised my friend and I with a giant stuffed fortune cookie cake that contained chocolate and vanilla creams.   It had \"Happy Birthday\" written on the plate and was on the house!   Quite a surprise to end the night."

Being a local, I don't really get out much to the strip unless visitors come into town. When some girlfriends of mine came into town, we were very excited about trying Tao. \n\nOur reservations were for 10pm on a Friday night. We didn't get seated until 10:40pm. That wasn't so bad, since the wait staff was very attentive. Finally seated, the three of us ordered right away and then the wait began. During this time, three other tables around us, got seated, served and left, while we kept waiting. The gracious waitress kept coming by to apologize and the faithful water attendant never let our glasses get less than 3/4 full. We definitely got re hydrated, but were starving. \n\nFinally, we requested to speak to the manager. When he finally showed up, he didn't have much to say, and didn't seem at all apologetic. The saddest and most ridiculous part was that he blamed the 90 minute wait on The Wok!! Seriously?!! \n\nThis huge establishment should have more than one wok. What kind of excuse it's that? He didn't offer us any appetizers for our trouble and we finally suggested maybe a dessert would be nice.  So, our food finally arrived and I ordered the Duck Fried Rice. I love duck and I'm a kind of a salt-aholic usually, but my dish was just meh, greasy and salty even beyond my ability to tolerate. My friend's dishes were also just ok, but NOT worth the hour and a half wait. \n\nWhat if we had tickets to a show or had to catch a flight? Anyway, we hoped the desert would be better, but 30 minutes after finishing our meal, dessert still hadn't arrived. A woman came by offering us stamps to get into the night club, which we wanted to try, so we still had hope. Another 15 minutes passed by, still no dessert, we finally decided it was time to leave.\n\nThen it was time for the night club. What a let down! First of all, much like the restaurant, a lot of people weren't even dressed nice. Packed to the gills, as expected, but the dancers looked bored and were barely trying. Then there were these sad, mopey girls sitting in the cement bath tubs. Seriously? \n\nThe dancers at Hard Rock are so much more entertaining. I was sad. Sad that my great expectations were crushed, sad that my girlfriends had this same lame experience on their first night in Vegas. \n\nMaybe you need to be blind drunk in order to look passed all these short comings and hoot at the top of your lungs. Maybe that was were we went wrong or maybe Tao jumped the shark.?"

Whenever I don't get her it's still great and professional though. \n\nAs far as flavor goes, I rate it brimming near the top notch for Asian fusion. Nothing I had was bland. Some things were not up my alley, like some of the sushi (we had a shit load of sushi), but I can be a sushi snob. \n\nIt's sweet dishes and there's lots of teriyaki and similar flavors, and I really don't understand people calling this a cop out. Asian fusion is supposed to be sweet sometimes. Right? \n\nThe tuna tartare on crispy rice is my SH*T! Drunk, sober, day, night, at the pool, at the restaurant, begging for it at the club bar. \n\nI love the Hamachi sashimi in their ponzu (?) sauce and topped with jalape\u00f1os. Even though you can find this EVERYWHERE in Vegas, like all the top hotels are required to serve it or something. Whatever. I'll take 10. \n\nThe lobster wontons were seriously good but honestly I think it's because I fall for the hype of lobster like all the time, it's seriously annoying. I forget that there's a way to do any lobster anyway and as long as it's not like eating a sea shoe I love it. So know that before you take my advice on these lobster wontons. I love lobster ravioli and this was like that but with an Asian flare and swimming in a soupy like base. \n\nWe had the crab cakes and I approve. Not like this is the place you must get your crab cakes, but let's be predictable and order the crab cakes shall we? \n\nWe had some kind of hot dish thing that came in a cast iron bowl and our server mixed it for us at the table. My hubs loved it and I thought it was A-Okay. \n\nThe Chilean Sea Bass is good. Some people find it a little sweet. \n\nThe rest of the food we had and can't remember was okay to good and some were actually well worth the price. However, the 85$ ribeye is not worth it no matter if it's a damn good steak. A lot of truly good ingredients at Tao are ridiculously priced if I'm to be 100 about it. Like $38 for the sea bass with no carbs is kind of annoying. Sometimes, too much is too much and your bill here should definitely not be cheap. \n\nThis is one of the sexiest restaurants on the strip in my opinion. Go at night to see the girlies in the bath tubs. Oh and if you have dinner here you can enter the club for free apparently. \n\nThe atmosphere and ambiance is sultry Asian. The lighting is low and dimmer than dim. I will admit my first time I was not drunk enough and complained about how in the world I would be able to eat let alone see my food. Totally falls in line with the club vibe, and I guess you can make out over dinner? \n\nSad to see some bad reviews on the food, as I do believe they meet expectations in a Las Vegas sense. Give it a go and ask for my girl Heather. Tell her to go away if she's too nice to you. She won't take it personally. She's just amazing like that."

As most places are in Venetian it was very expensive but the quality wasn't the best. If you want a nice restaurant with delicious reviews you should probably go outside the casino.\n\nI got the shabu shabu filet mignon cooked in a ginger scallion broth with wasabi dipping sauce and the udon noodles with vegetable. The shabu shabu filet mignon was really good, though I don't prefer my meat rare done they recommended cooking it in the broth for 3 - 5 minutes which made it way to well done. So I was able to cook it 30 seconds and it was the perfect texture and juiciness. I mixed the wasabi sauce with real wasabi and that made the sauce for the filet mignon even better. I enjoyed my main dish a decent amount and would give that a 4.5 / 5\n\nI didn't like the udon there was way too much salt and too much sauce, the sauce literally drenched the udon noodles and vegetables. The udon tasted very typical and nothing great, I'd rate the udon a 2 star.\n\nEven though the ambience was really great our service wasn't the best, the waitress didn't seem to respect us (maybe because we were young) and not give us great attention nor was she the most polite.\n\nWent with 11 people and most of the people didn't enjoy their food because it was super expensive and the food was just average. If you want high-class food you'll want to try somewhere else."

It was surprisingly very close to being authentic and yet Asian fusion style. But, regardless what you order, everything is going to be flavorful. Their service was fantastic, and they are able to split your bill individually especially if you are traveling on business with a large group.

I made a reservation several weeks ago for 8 pm and they made us wait for 45 minutes.  Once we got seated, it took another 20 minutes for them to take our order then we waited another 20 mintues between appetizer and the main courses.  When my friend complained, the waitress responded by saying, \"I was trying to time it right,\" then proceeded to bring out the rest of the remaining dishes (all six of them) in one shot!  \n\nGratuity for a large group is automatically  added at 20%, so I got the impression that  they take no pride in taking care of their guests once you're seated.\n\nMy rankings are the following: \nService: one star\nFood: two 1/2 stars\n\nThe Chilean Sea Bass and the New York Strip steak were decent.  The potstickers were average.  The noodles and the XO string beans were over seasoned and soggy.  You can get better Chinese food elsewhere for 1/4 the price. We paid $57 per person.\n\nBottom line is you pay for the ambiance mostly at Tao, but the food is mediocre at best.  A dinner that should have taken 1 hour and 1/2, took 3 hours due to poor service and lack of attention.  I would think a restaurant of their caliber would take more pride in treating their guests right."

What do you think of when you think of Tao, besides Winnie-the Pooh, maybe a pathway or a philosophy of the true nature of the world? Tao restaurant located in the Venetian has found their \"pathway\" through their food. \n\nUnbeknownst to me, Tao is one of the hottest places on the strip. Not only is it a restaurant but a lounge, banquet hall, a club, and celeb hot spot. I guess I know how to pick them! What I like is that the service treats everyone like royalty. The service here is insanely fast and they have more then enough staff on hand. We met one host and then got seated by another, then our server, a water guy, a guy that brings out food, and then a guy that takes it all away. The decor was insane too, dark rich colors, all kinds of fabrics, very bold and very detailed. Of course the 16 foot tall Buddha stands out just a little. \n\nThe most impressive attribute about Tao is their food. Tao specializes in Hong Kong Chinese, Japanese, and Thai cuisines. I know it's a lot but this location is huge so they room for it all. The crispy Tuna roll was unbelievable and all it consisted of was fresh tuna in a roll with a crispy outer ring of something (they wouldn't tell me what is was). Vegetable dumplings and veg egg rolls were surprisingly filling and were perfectly cooked. Of course you have to get something tempura, I recommend the asparagus, it wasn't greasy at all, we loved them. So for dessert you have to get the Giant Fortune Cookie (it's almost the size of your head), yeah it's cheesy but it's filled with white and chocolate mousse and you won't be able to put your spoon down. \n\nOther then the drinks Tao is relatively cheap, at least compared to most of Vegas. But even if it wasn't Tao is worth the visit."

My bias is that I don't like Vegas in general, but this place reminds me of the worst fakey aspects of Vegas, Hollywood, and Beverly Bills. The real Buddha might have laughed his belly off at the vanity, superficiality, and ego-parfum of this place, or silently glided through the materialistic depravity.\n\nI had a vegetarian bowl....about 3.00 worth of vegetables with a 400% markup, which was my fault. I read some online reviews that were all so glowing I lost my marbles and went. Lost some bucks, and more importantly I wasted another sliver of my life. Going to Vegas even for that 80 minutes, after being in Zion National Park , almost ruined the serenity I gained the during the whole trip.\n\nThe restaurant Tao has nothing to do with the real Way of the Tao, as far as I can see.

Pretty pricey but worth it. I ordered the coconut shrimps they was really big and thickly breaded couldn't finish it all. My bf ordered the Mango Chicken. We also shared  Shrimp Tai Fried Rice. We are heavy eaters but we got full fast. Next time we are in Vegas we will definitely be eating from here again and exploring the menu. We also order some beef which was that nights special.

We came all the way to Vegas from San Diego, and we were curious about Tao's because of the interesting decor etc. \n\nQuite literally the moment we arrived the atmosphere became oppressive. Our biggest concern and the truly unforgivable factor in this ordeal was that the very second we arrived, there was a security guard playing on his phone who for some reason or other determined we were criminals of some sort.. He was large, Caucasian, and messy haired (I only write this in the hopes that the management will read this review at some point and give him a stern talking to), this lummox of a man took one look at us and apparently instantly decided we were up to no good. I have no idea why, we were a young couple, well dressed, happily chatting etc. He didn't take his eyes off of us for the entire night, he followed us when we went to the host to claim our reservation (which just FYI took about ten minutes or so after our reservation time), he followed us to our seats, glowering the whole time. He checked in on us every now and again, just standing a bit away from us trying (and failing) not to be obvious about it. When we had eaten and we started to head out he was coming back to check on us again, the moment he saw us he turned back around and started speaking into what I assume was an earpiece. Not subtle at all... My girlfriend at this point was incredibly upset; she didn't know if he was sizing us up as criminals, drooling over her (she is very attractive), or if he thought her mid length skirt was a sign she was a hooker or something (no way...her outfit was very tasteful). Either way she walked straight out. I however walked up to our forboding shadow and asked if there was a problem and why he had been glowering at us all night. He responded with \"Oh its just... Nothing...\" and looked away. Very nice, Tao... Treat your patrons like criminals and then halfheartedly try to cover it up with lies... \n\nBut that aside on to the restaurant itself. \n\nThe atmosphere at Tao is admittedly very nice, trendy music playing constantly beats like the pounding heart of the restaurant. Clumsy Asian inspired art does its job in setting an oriental-fusion mood for the dining hall, watched over by a giant Buddha, overdone but altogether nicely set. \n\nUnfortunately the atmosphere is the best part of the restaurant. We had two people help us with our meal, a bus boy who was obviously better trained than any other member of their staff came, introduced himself, welcomed us to the restaurant and got us some water in a cordial yet amiable manner. I wish I had a better memory for names because if I could single him out for the managers I'd say he deserved a promotion.\n\nOur actual waiter on the other hand never even bothered introducing himself, he was rushed and a bit curt if I'm being honest. but he did take our orders and get our food to us so there's that much... In his defense he did seem to have a full load in his section but it was still off-putting, that he didn't even say \"Hi\", just \"So what can I get for you folks tonight\"... \n\nThe food itself was well... okay... I mean it was nice, don't misunderstand, it was good food. Just not great, definitely not worth what they asked for. I had the Crispy Thai Pork which almost seemed like it came out of a frozen meal package, and my lady had Spicy Chicken which oddly enough was less spicy than my dish, in fact the chicken itself was rather bland. So the food was a bit of a let down too. \n\nThey were also out of most of my favorite beers, Tiger, Sapporo etc. so I settled for a warm Kirin out of the bottle. Not much to say other than well, warm beer. \n\nAll in all I sadly have to warm away anyone who actually wants to have a good time in Vegas. Tao is rife with ridiculously bad staff and disappointing food. Do not ruin your evenings as we did by frequenting this travesty of a restaurant.\n\nBoy I wish we had just ordered Room Service..."

Way to go on the customer service Tao.  I had the Tao-tini--A+ my friend the Tao Cosmo.  Both smooth and easy.  \n\nThe food--ordered in portions and had wonderful dishes:\nSpicy Lobster/Crab roll excellent\nSteamed Veggie Dumplings--needs extra dunking sauce yum yum\nDragon Tail ribs--ok could have done without\nCrispy Rice Tuna Tartar--OMG, could have 2 of these\nHot Edamame--fav.\n\nDessert was over the top:  \nGiant Fortune Cookie exploding w/ chocolate mousse VERY rich, so be warned\nRice Pudding Creme Brule w/ extra scoop of ginger ice cream!  Just like mom used to make back south--right.  \n\nOur waiter was helpful, but a bit stuffy--otherwise an overall stellar performance by Tao.  Be careful not to trip on the way out over the eager Tao nightclub revelers."

He suggested a lobster wonton appetizer that we really liked. \n-I like people watching so the atmosphere was great for me.\n-The bathtubs lining along the entrance are pretty cool. I'd totally have my dinner in there if they let me.\n\nDidn't like so much:\n-Umm....there's a bathroom lady/attendant. I always think it's unnecessary to have someone handing me a towel after washing my hands. I didn't bring my purse in there so I had no money to put in the tip jar, which made the whole thing quite uncomfortable.\n-The decor was a little too \"fusion\", like they try to do everything Asian but don't do anything that well. I expected a bit more from such a fancy place. \n\nWe enjoyed our time here but probably won't come back because it wasn't impressive enough, and strong impression is what people expect in Vegas."

I had already been before, but it had been a while and it was for clubbing purposes only, so i had forgotten how pretty (and DARK) it was inside. There was a slight line, but i had reservations so i didn't have to wait for a table. It was pretty crowded (but it was a Friday in Las Vegas so duh). so our table was slightly cramped but no big deal. \nI ordered shrimp tempura, and california rolls. My mother also ordered some sushi(can't remember which ones) but everything was good,  My dad had some spare ribs that were extremely tender(i got a piece off his plate) and my brother ordered the Thai Duck fried rice-which was so good, he ordered another and I ordered one for myself. \n\nSo because I checked into Tao via Yelp I received a free ginormous fortune cookie for dessert. It was filled with chocolate and vanilla mousse and very yummy. And because our waiter was so nice, he brought a second one free of charge with candles to celebrate my mom's birthday. Very cool. She enjoyed it and it made her bday memorable-and solidified my position as her coolest child."

Especially for a purportedly high end place with over priced food and drinks.

I decided to tenderly call it \"the blitz\"\n\nThis necessary intro will frame for you the picture of my everyday routine in Vegas; as I made my way for the Sands expo center at the Venetian, and with the imperative need to eat some breakfast and lunch. It was not until Friday, after a party at said hotel's poolside, that I finally had the opportunity to sit down at a real restaurant, where I would have at least, real food (the rest of the evenings, btw, dinner was served in a bottle with lime) Enter Tao:\n\nOh yes. Finally some tranquility, some posh, some xanax imbued zest! My muscles relaxed the moment I sat at the couch. My pancreas wept alongside my saliva centers as soon as I blinked through the menu options. I refuse to pejoratively call \"drooling\" what clearly was the act of tender weeping. The why? Crispy Spicy Tuna and the lusciously fresh Salmon in a sweet (but spicy) sesame sauce and incrusted with crispy onions. Naturally, I enjoyed every bite of these dishes with unabashed contempt to all cuisines under the tyranny of wesson oil, and with unabashed praise towards the butcher's dexterity of the sushi liberating chefs. Kudos.\n\nAs I made my way towards the bathroom, I noticed that Tao offers an expansive seating area to accommodate many refugees like myself, and when I also saw the stairs that led to the TAO nightclub chamber, I couldn't help but feel how the imposing pictures of the monks and innocent children that loomed in the walls in front of me, where in fact, severely bent on scattering my sinful wishes aroused, or perhaps to manipulate them by whispering in a nomadic tongue: \"Its all-ight, we approve!\" And so that you know that monks never lie, Tao offers to stamp a comp admission to the TAO nightclub above in your pumping wrist, only and if you have dined in the zen establishment. Watch the horror and astonishment of the serpent-like queue as you breeze by them and re-enter for the club scott-free (yes, they make you exit, and re-enter through the VIP line in order for you to undergo a quick ID inspection. Sorry toddlers!)\n\nSo I have no problem bowing to the wisdom of the Tao Te King, and acknowledging that \"Tao\" is indeed \"the way\". Do come to this amicable speck in the midst of the chaotic Vegas strip Taiji to replenish your Yin, and by all means, your Yang waiting for you upstairs."

(not instead, but TOO!). luckily, he always has a small appetite, so we got to share!  perfectly cooked salmon, too. not dry at all, or bland. from what my brother said, the shabu shabu was also really yummy, and the broth that it's cooked in is nicely flavored.\n\nnot only was the food great, the service was incredible. people kept asking us if we were enjoying ourselves, and our waitress and waiter were not rude one bit, which made my cousin's 30th birthday so special for her. they recommended the dessert sampler, $65 for a variety of desserts (a HUGE fortune cookie, chocolate mousses, molten lava cake) and they stuck a sparkler in there so we can sing happy birthday to her. she loved it! and it fed all 14 of us. the desserts are fabulous! our party spent $845 a good amount of food, a couple bottles of sake, and a bottle of wine. not bad at all, in my opinion. i will for sure be there the next time i'm in vegas!"

I had an incredible, delicious, mouth watering meal here, but who would really expect any less from Tao!?\n\nMy writing cannot possibly do the ambiance of this place justice. The vibe is dimly lit, serene, meditative, Buddhist style meets sexy, bold, modernism. The decor is absolutely incredible, and we loved overlooking the GIANT Buddha statue sitting on top of the coy fish pond. I could not get enough of how sexy and awe inspiring the decor was, hard to believe it is located within a resort. So, so, soooooo beautiful! Everything is trendy and Asian inspired.\n\nThe outstanding service goes beyond words. Every staff member from waiter, to hostess, to bus boy was beyond friendly, high energy, had big personality, helpful, and professional. Whoever trains the staff here needs to give lessons to every dining establishment in the country.Tao does it right. The ambiance and price makes you feel like you're somewhere exclusive, but the service lets you know without a doubt that your service is appreciated. Bravo, bravo, bravo. Cannot say enough. \n\nNow...the reason there's a collective pile of saliva under me....the food. We can never decide what to order at Tao, so we close our menus and make our waiter order for us, and they are always spot on. Ordered the lobster dumplings as an appetizer. SO flavorful, large dumplings with a delicious, full bodied sauce with mushrooms amazing. I couldn't even finish my share. For a meal we split the Peking duck for two. The closest I've ever had to an out of body experience. Holy _____. The crispiest, best, most tender, most juicy, most PERFECT DUCK I HAVE EVER HAD. We tried a new rice with Chinese sausage and a fried egg on top whipped together right at the table for you...amazing. Despite the full term food baby inside my stomach, and the hatred I had for myself for eating so much, I forged on and demanded that we try the fried bread pudding with vanilla ice cream, chocolate sticks, and bananas foster sauce...biggest smile ever. Servers gave us awesome suggestions on things to do after dinner, but guess what I did? NAP! :) \n\nI am so impressed with Tao and this location lived up to every expectation I had. My favorite restaurant ever! \n\n**MAKE A RESERVATION!! WE MADE OURS A MONTH IN ADVANCE AND GOT THE BEST TABLE EVER, OVERLOOKING THE 1ST FLOOR AND RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE COY POND**"

We had lobster wontons, the tuna tartar, and the chicken dumplings. Of course these were fine, how can you screw up a dumpling. For dinner we had sushi and it was some of the fishiest we've ever had. Just awful. We also had the miso glazed Chilean Sea Bass and it was tasty but I think it was undercooked. About a half hour after eating it, I got really sick. We kicked down like $150+ for dinner and it was as if I hadn't even eaten it. It honestly could have been anything I ate there that made me sick, but I really think it was the sea bass. \n\nWe even had plans to go to the nightclub afterwards but we had such a terrible dinner we wanted to get the hell out of there. We ended up at the Palms. Avoid Tao. It's just not worth it."

It was my husband and I's night out on the town just to get a late bite to eat while visiting in Vegas from lA. it's definitely a people watcher scene and a very loud place but the ambiance was incredible. The food was very good. We had the lobster wontons, yum! and 3 different sushis and the steak. I would have liked to tried the seabass my favorite but my husband wanted some beef. Overal the place was great the only negatives were the drinks were not that strong, usually on  greygoose lemondrop I am good to go, but i had two of their tigerlillies and didn't seem like there was a lot of alcohol.. also we had a reservation and had to wait about 25 minutes, but was told wait a few minutes while they were setting our table. which probably was not the case.\n\noverall i'd come back w/a girl's night out but for romantic date night, probably choose a quieter place\n\n(also agree w/ the guy that mentioned the tap water request, they ask what type of \"bottle\" water you want and if you say no they say oh ok, so tap water is fine, instead of just saying water..)"

Except, that is, for the bathroom, which is inhabited by a human soap dispenser. Awkward and disgusting. But overall still a 6 -- yep, it's that nice! \n\nWhat could be greatly improved are the service and the food. Service is painfully slow, and food is so far removed from Asian it's laughable. Not that I expected the \"Asian Bistro\" to be authentic, but I was expecting the food to be at least palatable (it barely met that standard). The portions are also ginormous so you either let half your meal go to waste or leave completely gorged (take-away is impractical, for obvious reasons). One plus in the food department was presentation: the plating, like the decor, is faultless. \n\nThe last time I ate here was during restaurant week, and that ended up being over $200 for 2 people (we ordered wine). I will probably be back, but maybe just for drinks next time."

Go with the steak!!\n\nMandarin Sizzled Fried Rice with Peking Duck ($15). This was good!

Can't touch the cheaper versions in Chinatown!  Pass\n\nAnd to finish, the Dessert Platter. This thing was HUGE!! Enough food for the 10+ of us!

We made sure to get an earlier reservation (6:30) on a Friday evening, so we didn't have to worry about the night club crowd coming or having our reservation be bumped.\n\nI had originally asked for a private table after reading reviews on here about some tables being too close to one another.  We were seated on the third level over looking the main floor and the table couldn't have been more perfect.\n\nThere were two of us having dinner this evening, and Tao didn't disappoint (at this time slot) for a romantic evening.  The lighting, decor, and music were all absolutely perfect.\n\nWe started out with the lobster wontons and veggie dumplings.  He had a gin and tonic, I ordered a shirley temple  (unfortunately he brought me a roy rogers, but I wasn't going to whine about it and have him run down three flights of stairs for another soda for this pregnant chick).  Entrees were wasabi crusted filet mignon and orange chicken with pork fried rice.  PHEN-O-MENAL.  I have never had such good food enter my mouth.  I HATE steak, and my husbands cut of meat almost turned me into a convert.\n\nDessert was fruit and sorbet, making for a perfect food ending to the experience.\n\nOur server was just ok, but the young man doing the clean up work was the one who deserved the kudos.  Just an over all pleasant guy.\n\nI suggest this restaurant to anyone...just make sure you go earlier in the evening, and I think you'll be hard pressed to bitch about ANYTHING."

If your tight on cash and can't afford to go big, then I suggest you order just one thing and that is the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables. It is just as good as the reviews claim it to be. Buttery and tender sea bass that melts in your mouth with a delicious miso reduction.\n\nI also loved the Spicy Tuna Tartar bites served atop Crispy Fried Rice. There were 6 of them on the plate and the spicy aoili-like sauce on the plate was fabulous. \n\nLooking for a good bang for your buck?!? Try the Squab Lettuce Wraps, which are delicious and plentiful. We comfortably fed a table for six with them as an appetizer and asked for more lettuce \"shells\" to stretch them even further. \n\nOhhhh if you are trying to go big, ordered the Wasabi Encrusted Filet Mignon with Tempura Onion Rings. The beef is super tender and the wasabi seasoning on the outer edge is unique and incredible. The beef was also cooked to the perfect temperature.\n\nI would skip out on the satay, the sushi, and the chicken dishes. They are just so-so and I feel like that is when people walk away feeling ripped off."

However, I really enjoyed my dinner here.\n\nFirst of all, the decor is beautiful, albeit ridiculous. A restaurant called Tao, filled with numerous Buddha statues including the nearly twenty feet tall one in the main room, large photographs of sumo wrestlers in one dining area, and large color photographs of Buddhist priests of varying ages decorating the hallway to the restroom, and the overall opulent decor? Not to mention the crowd of tourists and revealingly dressed beautiful and less beautiful people. Not sure this is what Buddha intended but overall a very beautiful lounge and restaurant.\n\nWe had a reservation (thank goodness; the place was packed) but had to wait about a half and hour. We got a drink at the bar. Yes, well drinks were expensive but not surprising for Vegas. Once we were seated, we had a nice view of the gigantic Buddha. Our server was very friendly and informative. I felt in general the waitstaff was attentive, even though the restaurant was so busy.\n\nAs appetizers, we ordered the lobster dumplings in shitake mushroom broth, spicy ahi tuna on top of crispy white rice (basically like nigiri) and the toro toro roll. The dumplings and broth were excellent but the skin of the won tons were a little thick. The spicy ahi tuna was yuuummmy. The toro toro roll was the weakest dish. The fish was not very prominent, which was disappointing since I love toro. This roll was also topped with some sort of crunchy, sweet cracker-like topping that I did not love. \n\nWe also had two entrees: the black pepper flank steak and udon noodles, and miso-glazed sea bass. The steak and udon noodles were okay; nothing special. The miso-glazed sea bass was delicious and perfectly cooked. The vegetables it came with were somewhat of an afterthought but the sea bass was so beautifully cooked that I didn't care too much.\n\nDefinitely a fun, vibrant, LOUD environment. Overall, I was impressed by the quality and flavor of the food and I enjoyed the atmosphere."

The food was divine!!  We started with the Lobster Spring Rolls which were delish ...the Sea Bass truly is one of the best things I've ever eaten (apparently that's their sig dish) but the shut yo minute dish was the Coconut Shrimp.  Huge shrimp in this crispy coconut coating was beyond yummy ...\n\nWe finished with the Fortune Cookie which is much much more than a cookie!! \n\nFull and a wee bit tipsy we went through the gyrations to get into the club (why so many stamps and check points??) \n\nParty if was!!! Really amazing costumes. Great music. A place to stand or Dance.  Best of five clubs we visited!"

We were staying at the Venetian and wanted to go to the nightclub afterwards so we figured we'd just have dinner here.\n\nThe service at this place is impeccable! Not only was our server completely attentive, but there was also a clean up person waiting on his toes. Did you ever play Roller Coaster Tycoon when you were younger? Well, if not- in the game there are custodial workers that you can pick up and move over to any mess you see so they can clean it up right away. This is pretty much what that guy was. I swear there must be some one overlooking the tables at all times so if any spills occured, they \"pick\" this guy up and drop him at our table with wash cloth in hand, ready to clean up. Oh and upon realizing that I had received the pad thai with chicken instead of shrimp, I informed our server who apologized and offered to get it replaced immediately. After declining, mere moments later someone in management stopped by to apologize and offered the correct dish for me to take home- free of charge. If we weren't going clubbing right after I would have gladly accepted because that would have made for some awesome drunken munchies.\n\nThat leads me to the next thing. The food was delicious. Everyone at my table loved their meal. Also the general ambiance of the restaurant was nice. We were sitting there talking about how it really doesn't get much better: good food, good company, good wine. What a meal! My only complaint is that it is a little bit dark and loud in there. Hard to hear/see people.\n\nOh! Side note.  Upon being seated, we informed our server that we wanted to go to Tao the nightclub afterwards (we had heard that they can help you get in for free). Someone was sent to our table near the end of the meal to help us out. Unfortunately they could only give us a \"line jump\" stamp but it didn't really matter since we were staying at the Venetian and were already on the guest list."

Didn't eat at Tao nor go clubbing upstairs but had drinks here. \n\nTo enter, you walk through this tunnel with bathtubs of water and flower petals - we didn't see any women in these tubs despite the many reports of them. You then enter a super cool-looking big lounge area with dim lighting where you can get a drink and watch all the pretty people and wannabe's walk by. Past the lounge is the restaurant area where you are greeted by this ginormous buddha statue with candles all around it.\n\nBottom line: Probably one of the most cool and happening places in Vegas to grab drinks with some friends and people-watch in a hip Asian atmosphere . But come early to secure a booth as it can become a madhouse with lines of ppl out front when the club opens."

            "review": "Large parties dining at Tao should know this....\n___________________________\nTo my surprise, 4 stars for the food, but an overall 2 stars for the ridiculous way we were charged for the food and how our complaint was handled.  I dined at Tao with a group of 9 for a bachelorette party the weekend of August 13, 2007. Although I was disappointed with Tao, I still had a great time with my fabulous girlfriends. \n\nI don't remember everything we had, but I enjoyed the Spare Ribs, Lobster Wontons, Chilean Sea Bass. Least favorite was the Pad Thai (one of the worst I've had) and chicken skewers. \n\nReason for 2 stars:\nAfter we were seated, our waitress didn't come by for what seemed like 10 minutes to introduce herself. When she came by, she was friendly but did not communicate clearly how she was taking our order. Since it was so loud and our waitress didn't have a very loud voice, 3 different members of our group asked her to clarify how much food she thought we should order. She specifically told us that we should order 3-4 starters and at least 5 main dishes. That took me by surprise b/c I thought this is small plates and how could that be enough food? So I repeated what she said to me just to clarify that 3-4 appetizers would enough food for 10 girls? We decided to just order as much as she recommended and we can order more if necessary. \n\nWhen the dishes arrived, we were all suprised at the large portions. What we found out when we got the receipt was that the waitress doubled and tripled each order (as she saw fit) so it would be enough for our table of 9. She NEVER once said she was going to do this and we were upset because we had so much leftover food and even ate more than we wanted so it wouldn't be wasted.\n\nIf we had known this is what she was going to do, we would have ordered different items. I can't remember if she tripled any main dishes but the end result was a very large bill and wasted food. \n\nWhen we brought this up to our waitress, she insisted she explained it and after she left, she never returned to our table. We then spoke to the manager who said he could only give us 2 drink tokens to compensate for the miscommunication. This is so lame and such a cheap gestere to rectify the situation. The least he could have done was get us into the nightclub for free afterwards. \n\nI have never, ever, gone to a restaurant where they took the liberty of doubling or tripling your order without telling you. I've always said, I want 1 order of this, 2 orders of this, etc.\n\nI would not go back to this restaurant again. Food was good but not worth the price. \n\nThe club is ok if you get in early but by 1pm it gets too crowded to walk around and check things out. We got free line passes but had to go out, get in smaller line, pay $20pp at the door + get a hand stamp, then headed upstairs to the night club. Seems like a classy place but I find it offensive that they have skanky girls taking baths and playing with each other surrounded by all these bhuddas."

Let me point out a couple of things-\n\nI saw someone who gave this restaurant 2 stars say that, \"I've never eating here, but I'm reviewing their service.\"  Then don't even bother posting your review- save us the time and save Yelp's bandwidth.\n\nAnd to people complaining about the loud music.\nWhy, did you bring your family there to celebrate your granddaughter's baptism?  Nice, real nice.\n\nOh, and stop comparing Asian restaurants to Panda Express- it's getting old.\n\nFirst off, you can obviously tell that I love this place.  Let me tell you why.\n\nEven during the first time I ate at Tao, I didn't expect it to be a quaint and gentle dinner made by a world-renowned chef.  Tao's advertisements have a naked woman with \"Always a happy ending\" tatooed to her back in Chinese.  Seriously, what did you expect?  If you think that kind of lewd advertisement says, \"Bob and Daisy's Kosher Garden Cafe,\" I'll fly myself to your city to slap you.\n\nI came there and got what I expected and a bit more.  Stunning interior design by a NY firm whose design philosophy is heavily based on catering to the audience.  From the dramatic lighting, the 2-story buddha, and the naked girls in the bathtubs at the tunnel entrance- if you think you can take your grandma on her tennis-ball walker to this restaurant, you deserve a second slap.\n\nAs far as the food goes, it was fine.  Yes, I could've gotten better food at an off-strip restaurant, but was I there mainly to have the ultimate epicurean experience?  Absolutely not, I was there to eat, enjoy the energy of the restaurant and most importantly, to have fun with my friends.\n\nWhat, you're gonna give a restaurant who serves amazing food 5 stars even when the food is served on paper plates and they're located in a rat-infested hole in the wall with horrible servers?  Don't be ridiculous.\n\nAs far as the service goes, I'll admit- it's not flawless.  They do know a lot about the menu and about Japanese and pan-Asian cuisine, and they're quite attentive.  But the hostesses could be a bit more polite.  You know why they're ticked off by the end of the night?\n\nImagine yourself as a tall blonde girl with 32C's, getting drunk calls at all hours of the night, getting hit on and gropped by the occasional stranger.. and hassled by the idiot who decided to bring their 3 year old child and needs a baby seat.\n\nOf course, this is no excuse for the management to hire more enduring hostesses, but they don't care.  The money is coming, and they still remain as one of the most highest earning on the strip in terms of annual revenue.\n\nAnyways, you've heard it all.  I love this place because it's a place I can enjoy inexpensive food (seriously, $12 pad thai isn't that much on the Vegas strip), amazing interior, decent service, with people I know who can enjoy it with me.\n\nYou want amazing food, go to Joel Robuchon.  But be prepared- I don't think Joel himself will come out to thank your granddaughter for eating at his place on her baptism day since obviously, that's what you expect of Tao."

The order came with only three onion rings, they were good though but I expected more.  For my main course I ordered the chicken pad thai for $19.  They don't offer differing spice levels so I just added sriracha to mine to get my desired spice level.  The portion size was ok.  I could barely find chicken in mine so if I were to come here again I would go with the vegetarian pad thai.  The server that was filling our drinks did a very poor job, He walked past my empty water glass maybe 8 times before I had to say something to get him to fill it.

I wanted to go to this restaurant because quite honestly it is always in the gossip magazines as the celebrity hangout. I had stopped by last year for a glass of wine but had never gone for dinner until last week.\nThe entrance is absolutely gorgeous with two rows of what looks like baths filled with roses. It has a low light vibe to it and a gigantic Buddha that stands from ceiling to floor in the center of the restaurant. Ambiance is fabulous. Bring a light so that you can read the menu though! \nOur server was Lawrence who was an absolute delight from beginning to end. Great humor and a lot of fun. I recognized him from an unfortunate episode on the Kardashian's reality show. Lovely lovely guy. \nWe started our meals with an array of delicious appetizers. The standout was the Lobster wontons with shitake ginger broth. My friend and I practically licked the bottom of the bowl. Unbelievable. \nTwo of my friends ordered the steak which they both LOVED. The steaks came with three huge and gorgeous onion rings. Great presentation. My other friend ordered the sushi which was a hit as well. The entrees didn't hold as much interest to me as the appetizers so I \"settled\" on the coconut fried shrimp with spicy Thai peanut sauce. I asked if I could get it not fried but told I couldn't. I think it is because of the volume of guests they have each night. Disappointing as I would have been perfect if not fried. I was only able to eat two of them before it was just too much. I felt such a waste to leave all that food. The portions are very generous. \nWe finished the evening by sharing an order of the sugar coated doughnuts that came with vanilla and dark chocolate sauces and a caramel one as well. My one friend would not stop talking about them so even though we were full we had to at least try them. Again we licked the bottom of the plate!! What a fabulous way to end the meal.\nThe food and the ambiance were both outstanding. To top it off though was the service. Everyone we interacted with was just so friendly and professional. Special shout out again to Lawrence our server. I did stop Dave (another server) at one point and he graciously took care of getting some sauces for me for the shrimp - at no charge and with a smile. I found the fact that the service to be so good of somewhat of a surprise. This is basically a tourist place and so I wouldn't have great expectations for the service and the fact it was exceptional makes this place even more special."

The setting and service definitely is smack on but I was there for Food and it was utter disappointment.\n\nIt's Asian Fusion made American. It's the pimped up fancy cousin of Panda Express.. I was really disappointed with the food since I heard so many good things about them, I'm not saying they taste awful. They were decent for sure but for such a highly rated(and expensive) establishment it's just plain disappointing. \n\nThe Tempura was a shocker! The batter they use for the vegetables were inconsistent with the ones used on the Prawn which should be the star of the Tempura. It's just wrong on so many levels..I'm sure if one's never tried real tempura this would have gotten a pass but Com'on guys you have a rep to keep up.\n\nAll the Rolls were saucy as you might expect for American Cali rolls, so you'll never find these in Japan for sure.\n\nAll in all the Chinese dishes were Sauced heavily or sweet which is absolutely Americanized. \n\nThe servers however were excellent and know the menu really well. The decor is a 5 star for sure, and that's the only reason I give Tao a 2 Star and not a 1.\n\nI definitely won't be back."

I've found that a later reservation is the way to go - maybe 9:30 or 10:00PM. That way they'll come around and stamp you for the nightclub so you can walk right past the line after dinner and pay no cover. Definitely a perk for a Friday/Saturday. \n\nThe food is good and has been consistent over the years. A sushi roll and appetizer is plenty for me before hitting the town. It's very easy to overeat here trying different items! The lobster dumplings are fantastic and so is the rock shrimp. Any sushi roll with mango and the sauce is a must try! \n\nAlso - they make a GREAT dirty martini!"

You have to remember that Las Vegas is far from any port so if you are visiting from a town where they choose their fish daily from the port side fish market and you like seafood, they have a bit of a challenge here.\nWe went with a group of 7. We enjoyed both the bar and the restaurant.  Another yelper complained about the glass wine list, I don't mind trying new wines so I actually thought it was a good list.  \nThis is not a place to go for group discussion, you can't hear across the table.  But so long as you have good dinner partners on either side of you, you'll have a great time.  Beautiful People watching gets an A+.  The vibe and the atmosphere is definitely fun.\nMost of our party got the miso seabass which as someone mentioned miso fish (officially called \"saikyo\" preparation in Japanese) is always good.  I was very happy with my seafood hotpot that included nice sized scallops, shrimp and chunks of lobster.  \nAt the bar they serve complementary wasabi dried peas that are totally addictive.\nWe were at the Venetian for a trade show and had a big day following so we didn't take advantage of the VIP tickets to the club that they gave us with our dinner."

Food was tasty -- loved the squab lettuce wraps and yes, the chilean sea bass (although isn't it still on the do-not-eat list?) melts in your mouth.

Tao was also featured on the Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate where Duff Goldman selected their satay of Chilean sea bass as his favorite thing in Las Vegas.\n\nTao is located in The Venetian and it is a big spot with a dark decor (very loud as well).  Tao's huge menu is very modern Asian or Asian fusion with a wide variety of items including sushi, sashimi, edamame, satay, tuna tartare, hot and sour soup, dumplings, spring rolls, BBQ meats, tempura, wok-fried meat, poultry and seafood dishes, fried rice, and noodles.\n\nEverything was kind of okay, but while a few dishes were noticeably better than what you would get at a PF Chang's, a lot of it wasn't (and Tao carries a much higher price tag though part of that is because Tao is in Las Vegas).  We did have a fixed party menu so maybe more freshly prepared dishes would have stood out more though the flavors were not exciting or memorable.\n\nService was fine.  The food came out at a good pace.\n\nAs mentioned, prices were high for a just okay Asian fusion restaurant.\n\nTao does offer many different dishes and it brings in a lot of customers to make for a lively atmosphere so if either of those two qualities appeal to you, Tao might be worth checking out.  But if you are looking for high quality food or good value, Tao might not be the best choice on The Strip.\n\nLike other Las Vegas casinos on The Strip, The Venetian offers both free self and valet parking."

I have always thought of the club and not the restaurant when I heard the name Tao, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  We didn't have a reservation, but we only had to wait 15 minutes or so.  The service was crazy fast even though it was packed at 9:30 on a Friday.  Our server was very friendly and was very honest when asked about what was good and what we should stay away from.  I had the New York strip steak, and it was fantastic!  They also had a Kobe steak on the menu, which is what I really wanted, but I decided to save myself $83 and use it on drinks later;)"

Unfortunately the people that work there are clueless in how to work in a high quality restaurant environment. \n\nFirst of all the server never introduces his name and he absolutely hate to check on his table. How come you ask a birthday person if he really want the dessert?? Of course he want his dessert?? What are you? Stupid?? Its his birthday you idiot!!!\n\nBut now lets get to the food item.  Seabass appetisers was good and must try, lobster wonton was soggy and over rated, absolutely not for us.\n\nNow, watch out if you are going to order their PEKING DUCK. They cheat. Putting the price of $36 I asked the server if that price means the whole duck? He said yes. But when the bill comes its mark $72 on the bill apparently they charged $36 perperson for that damn duck. Its the most expensive duck I ever ate in my life and its not even all that good. I think this server is trying to scam people out of a nice dining experience.\n\nI only give this place an extra star because they do have an awesome birthday dessert that comes in a big fortune cookie and that my lovely fiancee took me here knowing that I might love the ambiance. \n\nWell,I did enjoy it, I love the decor and their food, but their service suck balls!!!"

Thursday nights are their Industry/locals night where they offer comped dinners to a few lucky ladies.. We were supposed to have 8 in our party, however, 2 couldn't make it but the host staff didn't b*tch about it so yay...\n\nWe were seated in a nice corner semi/booth table where we could see all the action.. Our smiling server greeted us and explained to us how the comped dinners worked.. It includes several dishes family style, 1 cocktail per lady & if you're lucky a round of shots! \n\nWe had many different dishes but some that stood out were:\n-Edamame: you're probably thinking edamame what??? But they give you 1 that is plain and 1 that is seasoned! yum!\n-Tuna Tataki: Fresh & perfect balance of heat! I just wish they would give you enough pieces to feed everyone.. I ended up having to go halvsies on my piece LOL\n-Dumplings: We got 1 green vegetarian option and 1 spicy pork option. The pork dumpling was definitely the winner!!! \n-BBQ Pork: was nice and flavorful and didn't have an overbearing pork taste.\n-Shishito peppers: tossed with yuzu dressing = YUM\n-Triangle shaped eggrolls- Jason recommended that we wrap them in the butter lettuce they are served on.. Great suggestion!!!!\n-Fortune Cookie Cake: It wasn't exceptionally delicious but I love the cute fortunes that come with it! \n\nService was AMAZING!!!! Our server, Jason R, made the dinner very enjoyable and even showed us a magic trick at the end of dinner! Definitely request his section! \n\n\nHOT TIP: Look for a promoter they usually have some free shot tickets to use at the bar ;]]] We were also supposed to get comped bottle service after dinner but as it turns out you can only get either dinner or bottle service & not both~"

We dined early on a Friday night - no reservations, just walked in about 5:30 pm and the place was mostly empty (just the way we like it). Gorgeous place, great atmosphere. We had the Chilean Sea Bass skewers to start, and we nearly fought each other for the right to eat more than our one skewer share. It was heaven. Then we shared the Wagyu beef entree and the sausage fried rice - both were truly excellent. The beef was fork tender and perfectly cooked medium rare. I had only really heard of the nightclub - not for me, but I would go over and over again to the Asian Bistro to eat."

If anyone is looking for excellent food at well rounded prices, then this is the place for you.\n\nNestled in the corner of the Venetian, a little ways from the indoor gondola ride area, Tao is an Asian food experience that is certain to make you want more. Not only is their service impeccable, but their food creations are sensational, beautifully balanced, and light. We went there to experience the hotel Asian cuisine a few weeks back, and I have to say that Tao was one of the best we've had in our lifetime.\n\nAfter ordering tempura to start, we followed with a kobe steak, kung pao chicken, and lobster gyoza in a mushroom truffle miso sauce to die for. The tempura was light, flaky, and melted in my mouth. The winner appetizer, however, were the lobster gyozas. The sauce was incredible, the lobster was sweet and the dumpling part was so soft and perfectly chewy. The entire dish was well balanced to the point where I wanted to drink the broth! The steak was so soft that a knife was unncessary, and the chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked. Our server was quick to refill at every turn, and there was so much to eat, dessert was not an option.\n\nAlthough our dinner cost well over 180 dollars, it was well worth the experience. Not only is Tao restaurant a genius at Asian flavors, but a visual beauty. I honestly cannot say anything about this place except--exquisite."

Upon arrival, the decor was very nice and I thought I was in for a treat.  Well I was wrong.  \n\nWe started with a few cocktails, which were good.  We ordered some starters, The Edamame sampler (was good and the garlic wasabe edamame was an interesting twist on a favorite), Hot and Sour Soup with Shrimp toast (my soup was pitch black, and the shrimp toast was burnt on the outside but mushy on the inside?), and Vegetable Dumplings (were overcooked, the skins were mushy).  \n\nFor entrees we ordered the Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken (which was basically like Sweet and Sour Chicken at most chinese fast food restaurants, but not fried), Eggplant, and Noodles.  After seeing the food I think the prices are absolutely ridiculous for what they provide.  The food is not flavorful in any way and I definently think that Tao needs to revamp their dishes (all of them were unimpressive)\n\nAt the end of our meal we did get a dessert which was a sampler of many of their desserts.  I have to say this was definently the highlight of a disappointing meal.  They had a sparkler on the dessert platter when they brought it out and the thing that caught my attention was the GIGANTIC fortune cookie (which has white chocolage mousse on one side and chocolate mouse on the other side).  They also had some sort of chocolate cake with a melted chocolate inside, and a fried dessert eggroll.  \n\nOverall I would recommend for the money you can find much better places to eat in Las Vegas."

It was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. Their wine/sake list provided lots of formidable pairings (I chose a Sauvignon Blanc). Several others in our party had the wasabi-encrusted filet mignon, but frankly it wasn't that impressive. It was served with tier of fried onion rings and lacked anything memorable in terms of taste, although it was cooked perfectly.\n\nA significant bonus of dining at the Tao is that you get a line pass stamp for the nightclub, although the process of getting into the club was not quite as seamless as we expected.

            "review": "Tao is one of those places that you feel is a must whenever you're in Vegas. In my opinion, it is one of those places that is a bit overrated.\n\nMy friends & I had reservations for 10PM at Tao about two Fridays ago to celebrate a friends birthday. When we first walked in we had to make a line in order to have our IDs checked. It was extremely crowded & noisy as we made our way up the line. Once inside we were given a beeper that would alert us when our table was ready. During that time we were waiting around & people kept rushing/pushing past us to get upstairs to the club.\n\nLet me get to the service & food. After we were seated we had a friendly waiter who suggested a couple of the restaurant's signature dishes. I discretely told him the fact that it was my friend's birthday in order for them to bring out a cake or special dessert for her (which they did - a mousse filled fortune cookie). He was great and started stating some random facts about the club after I whispered in his ear so she wouldn't catch on. So kudos to that. Service all around was AMAZING.\n\nThe food was decent. Honestly, what stood out to me was the miso glazed sea bass. I could have ate that & that alone all night long. Everything else was okay from the noodles to the several appetizers we did try out. I can't remember everything we ordered exactly.\n\nIf you're trying to go to the nightclub & are in the mood to eat something before hand then you should come check it out for yourself. With the purchase of an entree you don't have to pay the cover charge for the club.\n\nWill I be back? Not likely."

Only one on Friday night.\n\nMade reservations on OT 11:45pm, showed up at 11:50pm, and was not seated till 12:30am.  No biggie I guess, we just dranks a few cocktails and people watched at the bar.  \n\nThe more attitude you give the people at the host's podium, the better they will treat you.  \n\nThe prices of the specialty cocktails were $10-12.  I think that's a bargain in a luxury resort on the strip.  Bartenders were great, they were honest about the flavors of the drinks and warned us not to order certain ones.  \n\nTried:\nTao-tini, Saketini, Love Potion #9, Lychee Martini, Tiger Lily, & Orange Dragon.  \n\nPortions are pretty tiny here.  So be prepared to spend.  \n\nThe yum:\nOnion Stuffed salmon sashimi-we ordered a SECOND round.  \nCrispy lobster & shrimp dumplings, light & full of crustaceans!!!\n\nThe aiight:\nYellowtail sashimi w/jalapeno & ponzu, lacking in fresh flavor\nSpicy salmon roll, dull\nAssorted Nigiri\n\nThe ugh:\nSpicy Lobster roll w/shiso & black caviar, faux TOUGH lobster, ick!!!\n\nEnd of the meal: \nFREE chocolate flavored fortune cookies.\n\nPreferential club treatment:\nMaybe mid-week.  They just give you a stamp, but you still have to stand in line outside AND pay the cover charge.  I say just stand at the foot of the stairs and wait until the bouncer is preoccupied and mosey on upstairs."

We got an enormous platter that included a little bit of everything - the molten chocolate cake with coconut ice cream, chocolate Buddhas, the giant fortune cookie, and the chocolate parfait.

It's definitely not the place to be if you're looking to have a quiet conversation.  I loved the electronica being played in the background and they make great drinks.  My beef is that despite having reservations, you have to wait in line to check in, then wait in the lounge while they prep your area.  My dish of choice here is always the Peking duck.  I'll never understand though why they charge for 2 people when I ask for 1 order, perhaps that's the default?  If that's the case they should just have a base price on the dish of $68, rather than $34 / person.  I always enjoy ordering the spicy tuna over crispy rice, but couldn't' find it in the menu this time."

The dining area was a little \"cozy\" for my tastes, but we were led to a corner booth with plenty of room to be space hogs.  The giant Buddha across from us was awesome.  The food was splendid - the tempura was tender and crispy, the dumplings burst with flavor, and I even had duck for the first time and enjoyed it thoroughly.  My dining partner enjoyed the evening so much he took a rock from the assortment  behind us as a souvenir.  I don't think that's recommended by the management.\n\nThe thing that cracked me up the most about this place were the, what I like to refer to them as, Slut Fortune Cookies.  My fortune said, 'This evening, don't let common sense be your guide.'  With fool proof advice like this, no wonder Tao's celebrity clientele go all over the world flashing their cover-upable bits."

Of all the restaurant choices, I wanted my wife and Vegas newbie to experience the Ventian and Tao.\n\nReception by the hostess was luke warm and the table was so so with location near the big budda but too close to the server entrances.  But our waitress was extremely attentive and engaging for a Vegas wiat person making up for the poor reception ( I find most Vegas servers are dettached and have UNION written on their forehead.  Reminds me of Summit County Colorado wait staff who after a ski season make you beg for service).\n\nWe enjoyed the Chilean Sea Bass satay and a spicey Tuna roll for an appetize.  I drank a version of the Moscow Mule that was worth the crazy price.  The Sea Bass is so good I would consider it for appetizer, main course and dessert.  Our main courses consisted of the Ahi Tuna and Wyogi Filet Mignon.  Both tasted fantastic.  We walked out spending $240 ish.\n\nTao atmosphere reminds me a bit of a amped up PF Changs but the food is much better.  I highly recommend a reservation and dont accept the first table.  We saw an older guy come in with his \"niece\" I'm sure, and when he rejected the table near the wait person entance, he was shown a much better table.  I get the feeling a few bucks in the hand of the hostess makes a big difference here.\n\nI would definetly go back for a work event or a special occassion.  The place is a bit expensive and the service iffy, but foood quality is above average and considering the options on the main strip, its one of my favorites."

The combination of the tasty foods, fun decor, and excellent service makes Tao Las Vegas deserving of my first 5-star rating!  Of course, the Vegas excitement adds to the total experience.\n\nThis isn't one of Yelpers' favorite joints to dine at in Vegas based on the ratings, so I'll share a couple of tips of what I've done and hopefully that'll be helpful to you folks out there:\n\n- Making reservations here is a must!  Without reservations, this place is impossible to get into, unless you know people, or do the ol' slipping a bill into the handshake action.  (If you do, try $20 or higher)\n\n- Come with friends that are ready to party, because this is a party joint!  Meet at the bar, so that if you have folks coming in from different hotels, you can enjoy the drinks while you wait.\n\n- Once you're seated, order sharable appetizers, like the Edamame, Satay Chicken, or  Thai Stuffed Shrimps.\n\n- If you like Sake, they have a pretty good selection of Sakes.  If you haven't tried the Nigori Sake (unfiltered), I'd suggest at least trying that.  The best way is to ask the server to give you the rundown.We had the Voice in the Mist bottle and it was yummy!\n\n- For your entree, you MUST get Miso-Glazed Chilean Seabass!!  It's my favorite fish entree in the world!  Savory white flaky tender bits of tasty fish... oh my.  It definitely melts in your mouth yet creates a flavor explosion.  So good!  My friend likes the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon, but I think it's not nearly as good as the Seabass.\n\nI've been to Tao now for 3 years.  I've had a great experience every single time.  I now cannot imagine going to Vegas without my Chilean Seabass experience at Tao."

It didn't blow my mind.\n\nI think it is a great place for people watching and enjoying a cool atmosphere with decent food. Not a place to have a conversation with your friends or a romantic dinner as this place is loud and crowded.\n\nRemember to make reservations in advance otherwise its off to the sushi bar for you.\n\nThe only reason I can think of why one must go to Tao is coz its Tao. You have to go for the experience, its part of living it up Vegas style."

We had a packed schedule for the night, so I was really upset when 9:10pm rolled around and we were not seated. We arrived at 8:20pm, and I booked this table over 2 weeks ago. A couple of large parties walked in after and was immediately seated. I had to make the decision to leave because we were on a strict schedule. It pretty much ruined my best friend's bachelorette party since she was looking forward to the food at Tao. \n\nWe will not be making any reservations at Tao ever again."

There are too many amazing restaurants in Vegas to waste your time here. Turn around and head out, do not pass Go and save your $200.  Seriously, if you have any sort of culinary expectations look for another option.  If you're looking for naked girls in bathtubs, this may be your place (although, no girls in the bathtubs the night we came). \n\nA group of co-workers were all here for a conference and decided to try this place out since we were staying at the Venetian.  We made a reservation for 8:30 and when we arrived were told we would be seated 'in a few moments' 40 minutes later (and a few times getting the run around by the guy in charge of seating), we finally got to a table.   \n\nTao highlights the modern Asian fusion movement on their menu.  Unfortunately they also have tried to mask their lack of flavor in dishes by making them overly salty or overly sweet.  This makes everything taste like it's a microwave dinner or some sort of bad Chinese takeout.  \n\nWe tried the Thai Crabcakes (WAY too much sauce that was overly sweet with very little spice element, kinda tasted like one you can buy out of a bottle), Hot and Sour Soup (decent, but the shrimp toast was the highlight), Crispy Pork Bao Buns (The pork was again WAY too sweet and the bun had too much dough to pork ratio, this was barely edible),  Crispy Orange chicken (another overly sweet dish that was deemed not even as good as Chinese takeout), Kobe Ribeye (NO way this is real Kobe, despite assurances from our server. It was tough and hard to cut, we had real Kobe at Gordon Ramsey's the next night and there was no comparison) and a few sushi/sashimi rolls (decent, but the rice wasn't well flavored. We had better sushi at the buffet). \n\nOur waiter was very nice and attentive, but there were certain elements of dishes that were left off (rice for the Orange Chicken, asked for sauce on the side for a couple dishes that wasn't done).  All in all a truly regrettable experience from start to finish. Their fortunes for their cookies were pretty funny though."

A hallway full of naked women in bathtubs covered in rose petals. Winding maze to get from the hallways to the upstairs dining area. Plenty of bouncers to ensure eating privacy. All seemed fairly crazy to me at a place we were to have dinner but It was well worth it.\n\nThe Tao restaurant had some of the most delicious salmon I've ever had. I ordered the soy ginger glazed salmon with udon noodles and spinach. The salmon cooked to perfection, beautifully medium in the middle, and the udon was amazing. Every morsel, every bite, and every scent was packed full of flavor. The seasoning enhanced the flavor of the salmon rather than masking it.\n\nI eat a lot of Asian food, not because I'm Asian myself but because there is an abundant amount of Asian restaurants in my area. I wouldn't say the food at Tao is authentic but it is a warm welcome to to the culinary world with Asian influences.\n\nOverall, It was the best salmon I've ever had and definitely worth the price and I would definitely return. Next time I'm bringing my appetite and dancing shoes as the club is amazing."

The decor (by my friend Thomas) is spectacular- the club part is just gorgeous- Buddhas everywhere (ok, a bit too much beaucoup de Buddha), Asian antiques, big stone tubs filled with floating rose petals- the sheer scale of the thing is amazing.\n\nThat said, of COURSE it is obnoxious. This is Vegas baby, and this place is very popular.  So, you'll need a res for sure, and even then you will wait, and the waitron will treat you as though you are an enthused tourist who just can't wait for that exotic experience. It's not quite as bad as \"Would you like some Sake? It's Japanese rice wine, and by the way, some of the fish here is raw\", but...almost. HOWEVER the sake selection is excellent and shows good taste in a sake sommelier ( a big career ambition of mine), the cocktails are strong, and the food is decent. \n\nIt is worth visiting just for the upstairs bathrooms, which are completely transparent until you lock the door- then they cloud up (a trick also used in the NYC Prada store, but they don't serve sake). An interesting psychological test."

We said sure and they stamped our hands. When we walked up, the guy told us we still needed to go outside and stand in line . . . even though we had dined there. I thought for sure I misunderstood, so asked him again and he was extremely rude. At that point I asked the hostess and she showed us the line.

We had reservations for Saturday night for 8:30pm to celebrate my 30th birthday. Friends were gathered from Chicago, NYC, and San Francisco. We had a 45 minute delay in being seated at our table but that came as no surprise given the busy night. We were seated in the first floor dining area near the majestic two-story tall Buddha statue. Our server was courteous, attentive, and knowledgeable on the menu items.\n\nThe standouts for me appetizer-wise were the vegetable dumplings and egg rolls (i'm pescatarian and do not eat meat). My carnivore friends seem to enjoy the dragon tail spare ribs and meat potstickers. Through it all, the wine kept pouring.\n\nOur entrees came and I was dazzled by my Typhoon Lobster with Fingerling Potatoes and Spicy Stir Fry. This is when the bib would have come in handy because when I was done it looked like I had massacred an aquatic beast! Fine food, great conv, surrounded by top notch friends -  this was an evening to be remembered. \n\nI will mention that the pair who ordered the Peking Duck for 2 were indifferent to it. The description had sounded amazing but did NOT live up to their expectations. Everyone else enjoyed their food immensely though. Then came what would make for buzz that this meal was a contender for best meal ever - the dessert platter.\n\nOver the off-key singing of 'happy birthday' came the mother of all dessert platters. It included a scoop of ice cream, sorbet, molton chocolate cake, fruit, and a giant fortune cookie filled with white and dark chocolate mousse and chocolate buddhas. Simply incredible and I am not generally a dessert person. \n\nFrom the moment you walk in to the moment you leave Tao you feel as though you are experiencing something unique, exotic, and daring. The decor is chic and sexy, the vibe hip and happening. Thank you Tao for making my birthday dinner one I will never forget."

For dessert we had the doughnuts, which were light & fluffy with a sugar dusting and 3 dipping sauces (caramel, chocolate, vanilla). Their signature drink, Dragon Slayer, was also tasty and pretty strong. Total bill was $135 for 2 with tip and tax. \n\nAfter dinner you get a stamp on your wrist to cut the LONG line to get into the nightclub upstairs. I couldn't imagine doing it any other way.

So dinner was not on our dime, I never looked at a menu with prices, so I can't comment on how pricey the place is.\n\nI can say that the decor is the first thing that amazed me--loved it!  It takes a tremendously imaginative and talented person to create an atmosphere like this--which keeps you looking ahead to see what's around the corner and wondering what will astound you next\n\nThe next thing I noticed was the music being piped through the place--VERY hip!  Loud but in a good way.  A later trip to the ladie's room revealed that there's a talented DJ responsible for the tunes.  \n\nThe drinks kept coming and when it was time for dinner, we were presented with a lovely salad, followed by dinner served family style, including filet mignon, an UNBELEEEEVABLE Chilean sea bass with a gingery-garlicky yumminess to it, teensie weensie string beans, fried rice, and sauteed shiitake mushrooms.  Ummmm..HELLO!  After dieting for 2 weeks in anticipation of this trip, my taste buds were TRIPPIN'!!\n\nNext up was an assortment of desserts, including a Fuji apple tart-y thing with ice cream, a bowl of fruity stuff like tangerines, lychees, blackberries, raspberries and ice cream, chocolate lava cake and ice cream...on and on....this meal was planned to show me some love...ice cream and I, why, we're lovers!!!\n\nThe service was absolutely and completely IM-PECC-ABLE.  There was a staff of 5 or 6 dedicated to our group of about 40.  My water glass was never empty (or even close to it) and when I asked for a glass of sharp, dry white wine and the server came back with \"all she had on hand\" which was a Chardonnay and I politely declined, she returned a couple of minutes later with an unbelievable Pinot Grigio that hit the spot.  \n\nAll in all, a fabulous experience, and one I wouldn't hesitate to repeat on my second trip to this cool-ass town!"

The place is LOUD. Like night-club-loud and we could not talk at all during dinner, just because we couldn't hear anyone. I have tinnitus and had to pop in my earplugs during dinner, it was really bad. There are ALOT of stairs (you have to walk up and down stairs to get to the restaurant and club) which is kind of a pain, especially in heels after having drinks.lol.

We were there at 6 pm and even though most tables were empty the staff scrambled to get us seated. Most of the tables had a reserved sign on them and many of them were unoccupied during our entire time there so even though we did have a reservation I find it hard to digest that it could take them 15 minutes to get us seated at a time like 6 pm. Coming to the food - we ordered the chilean sea bass satay (on recommendation by the waiter) and peking duck. Both were disappointing.

It was tender and flavorful and was would definitely order again when I come back to Vegas.  Drinks are expensive, but what isn't pricey in LV? \n\nPros:\n- Great service\n- Great Ambiance\n- Sea Bass!!!\n\nCons:\n- Price"

I loved the giant Buddha although I found it amusing since Taoism doesn't necessarily+buddhism. But that's ok it was really fun to check this place out, now if only the prices were a bit more reasonable I'd be a real fan.\n\nWe had the tuna tartar (sort of japanese style), the peking duck for 2 which was very tasty but small, and some veggies in a black bean sauce that was very tasty as well."

So I went to Tao the night before attending a conference with some of my co-workers (the party peeps).  There were 8 of us and we had resos...but we forgot about the taxi wait and walking in 5 inch heels...first night rookie mistake.  We called to push the reso by like 15 minutes.\n\nThe first half of our group arrived and we were immediately seated in the lounge area until the second half arrived.  Upon their arrival we were immediately seated.  Our waitress was really sweet but she seemed new.  She took our drink orders...all adult beverages and water and then suggested we do the tasting menu...they like to offer that for larger parties.  I think primarily to make it easier on the kitchen...good luck with that with this group...let's just say #ADDisOurNativeLanguage we opted for individual entrees which was fine by me.  I was going to order the lobster kim chee fried rice but when I asked she said it wasn't her fav.  I asked which of the rice dishes was and she said the either of the duck fried rice dishes so I opted for the Thai duck fried rice and it was amazing!! #YummyYummyGetInMyTummy.  \n\nAll and all a nice dining experience but there were some small issues with the timing of the dishes being delivered to the table and two items did not make it to our table and had to be re-ordered but such it life.  I'll still go back though."

The hostess said the restaurant was closed and would not let me in to take a look.  It made no sense since I just wanted to look around the corner.  A very fashionable friend of mine went on a different day and was allowed to take a look in.  I don't know what is worse....I wasn't allowed to look at the restaurant because I was there when the hostess working was a bitch or because I wasn't fashionable looking enough.

The off the menu selections were great, the filet, the strip steak, and the chicken were all great. The steaks were cooked perfectly and the chicken came out flavorful and juicy. \n\nThe chefs selections came out in a bunch of small, family style portions, and featured everything from pad thai to fish skewers and edamame beans. Drinks were okay, the wines by the glass were good, and prices were more than fair for the offerings. Don't however, ask for anything off the menu. One person at the table ordered a grapefruit martini, and the waiter looked as though he had been hit in the head with a baseball bat, and ran off. What came to the table 20 minutes later was a glass of vodka with a splash of crappy grapefruit juice cocktail, it was horrid...Then showed up on the bill for $15+...\n\nMore things went awry when the bills were presented. The server dropped them off then disappeared for a half hour, with our table size he already got his built in gratuity so he seemed to not care anymore. We were billed 3 times for something we ordered once, and there were other things that got rang in more than once. The waiter conveniently attributed this to the \"chefs selections\" choice, and would do nothing to fix the bill. It ended up being $85+ per person for the chefs selections menu (those who ordered, requested to stay at the $50 price point, which the restaurant offered),\n\nOverall, the food was good, the steaks were well worth the $35-$40, and the wines were worth the $10-$12 glass, other than that, it was a bit over done. I would go back for the steaks and wine, but would recommend against summoning yourself to the chefs menu, seems like a great way for the restaurant to pawn off whatever isn't selling on you while charging whatever they feel like."

Personally I don't think its worth getting rolls The Lo Mien was bad ass the Pad Thai was unlike any other i have tried we loved it.  We had the Sweet potato tempura as the appetizer it was nice. The drinks however were not. the Tao-tini (I had to go there wanted something lighter) was just bad another person in our party got the lemon grass something and he didn't like that much either. The prices are so fair its ridiculous. Noodles ranging from 14-20 dollars. The Desert was sexy we got a big fortune cookie stuffed with Chocolate cream on one side and vanilla cream on the other It was hot. The best part is we got comp admission to tao night club and didn't even have to wait in line and honestly admission alone would have been the price of our tab. Tao is defiantly a Must!"

Nice and dim lighting, Asian writing on the ceilings. Music I gotta say was a bit loud. To the point where I had to yell my order out to the waiter. But nothing too bad. Had the filet mignon and noodles. Which was good. Brother had the sausage egg and noodles. Which to me sounds like a breakfast but he enjoyed it. My friend had the orange chicken. Which was very similar to panda express, no joke. Had some drinks and a bottle of cold sake. Yeah with tip and all. Still manage to keep the bill under $200. Which I have to say is damn good.

We went into the restaurant, party of 12, then towards the end of the dinner I went outside, my wife came out to check on me. She had a drink, tried to go back in with the drink she had when she left. He wouldn't let us back in. He didn't even want to give us a chance to give us a reason why we were going back in where we just  spent a lot of money, I wish I got his name because he ruined the experience and thus now whenever we go back to Vegas as we frequently do will NEVER spend our money there!"

Honestly, I probably would have had a better meal at PF Chang's and spent a lot less for it. My appetizer (steamed dumplings) was bland and my noodle dish was so oily and greasy! I left feeling quite unsatisfied and quite queasy too. \n\nWould I go TAO for the club and drinks? Sure - it's the Buddha that calls me.\n\nWould I go for dinner at TAO again? Yes, but only if I was outnumbered in a large group and that's where everyone decided to go. Otherwise... probably not."

Honestly, I have no idea what was ordered since I was able to enjoy the sharing plates that were already chosen by someone else at the table.  Don't think of this as an authentic venture into Asian cuisine, but rather a high end of your Americanized favorites.  Everything that came out was very tasty, a particular stand out was the orange chicken which was outrageously good.  The pad thai, tuna sashimi, various skewers of meat, ice cream mochi, were all tasty.  There wasn't a single dish that was ordered that I would have regretted ordering.  The waitstaff was a little kookey (his personality was incredibly bubbly in an odd sort of way) but he was very, very attentive to our table.  At no point did my drink empty, always presented dishes on the right, and people cleared our table quickly once items were finished.  The kitchen was equally able to keep the wait times between courses very minimal.\n\nAmbiance of the restaurant is pretty nice, kind of reminds me of Sea in Brooklyn.  They also had some pretty intense club music playing during the entire meal, apparently next door is a club so I guess that's kind of expected but it was definitely a club kind of atmosphere while we ate since the music was so loud."

I even chatted with our guy about changes I think they could make & he agreed and had his own recommendations, that showed that he was interested and not just a Tao crony.

Make sure you make reservations though, especially on the weekends, or you might not get the time you want or you'll have to wait awhile.\nThe decor is very trendy Vegas, with dim lighting, lit red walls to contrast the dimness , Buddha statues, bathtubs filled w/ rose petals, and japanese lanterns.  Ambiance is very chic, modern, and sophisticated.  \nThe food compliments the ambiance of the place, using traditional asian recipes and adding modern flair.  Here's what I had:\nAppetizers: \nSpareribs- asian flavored spareribs were sweet, tasty, and the meat came right off the bone - there were 6 spareribs in one order\nPeking duck springrolls- fried spingrolls with peking duck inside was delicious and not covered in oil like other springrolls\nEntree:\nMiso glazed Chilean Sea bass -  my favorite place to get Chilean sea bass never disappoints\nAmerican Kobe- my friend ordered this and he gave me a couple bites, and it was pretty good.  First time having Kobe beef so I wasn't too sure what to make of it.  Beware of $88 price tag.\nDessert:\nGiant Fortune Cookie- Enough to feed 4 and served with fresh tropical fruit.  The fortune cookie was light and complemented well with the vanilla mouse inside the cookie.  I found the chocolate mousse to be a little too sweet.\nService was efficient and friendly, so no problems there.\nI'll definitely come back to Tao every time I go back to Vegas."

I thought the noise level was a bit too loud among the music and various side conversations from neighboring tables.\n\nOur group of 14 decided to order family style. Dishes that stuck out to me:\n\n * Spicy Tuna tartare on crispy rice: One of my favorite things I ate at TAO. If you're afraid of spicy food, this wasn't too spicy. I enjoyed the textures and flavors this dish provided.\n\n*Squab lettuce wraps: delicious and easy to wrap.\n\n*Lobster wonton: I thought the wonton was overcooked, which had that \"mushy\" texture. Pass.\n\n*Miso glazed Chillian Sea Bass: Another favorite dish I enjoyed eating. I highly recommend this dish.\n\nOur bill at the end of our meal came out to $45 for 13 of us. Although the food was enjoyable, I personally thought that it wasn't worth $45. Then again, I had no input on what we ordered since one of the girls in our party was responsible for that. I wouldn't mind coming back and giving it another try though.\n\n*EDIT 9-26-12*\n\nI should clarify that each girl paid $45...not $45 for the total bill. If you're all about the food, you might as well head to a good Chinese restaurant and pay half the price."

The place was grossly overpriced so you're really just paying for the atmosphere. My fiancee and I were extremely let down and the place did not live up to the hype. Our hostess said that our dinner ($185 mind you) guaranteed entrance to the nightclub after but, of course, incompetent doormen & nightclub managers had no idea what we were promised an hour earlier. Save your money and go somewhere else! A group of our friends who made it in the club were split up since women were the only ones allowed upstairs. My fiancee and myself, on the otherhand, refused paying to go in since dinner was terrible and their word meant close to nothing. Honestly, if you want good asian food then go to an Asian restaurant, not an asian-themed restaurant. If you want a better Vegas experience take your spouse to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill for dinner @ Caesars and the Mix @ Mandalay (the Hotel) for after dinner lounging and drinks, where at both places you'll be deeply satisfied."

We had some drinks at the bar, talked to the bartender a bit and people watched. \n-When we were seated, I have to admit, I was a little disappointed with our table. It was one of those where you are right next to the neighboring table and share a booth with the stranger next to you. Not that big of a deal really.\n-My husband had the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon w/ Onion Rings. He was pretty disappointed. I felt bad bc I had talked him into getting this dish due to all the great reviews.\n\nThe Pros:\n-My dish alone is the reason I would go back to Tao and the reason I gave it 4 stars... the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass was outstanding! Best fish I've ever eaten. Just the perfect amount of sweetness and it melted in your mouth like butter. \n\n\nSomewhere in the Middle:\n-For an app. we had the Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice- good, not great. I was hoping it would taste like a similar dish I had once at Katsuya in Hollywood and it just didn't stack up. \n\n\nWill we be going back? Doubtful. Maybe if I go to Vegas with some girlfriends in the future I'll have a chance to eat some more of that delicious fish, but I will not likely be going back with the husband."

Three of us had the steak, another had the sea bass and i had the sword fish.  We also had the dragon roll, two servings of rice, dessert but no drinks.  The total came out to around $52 a head (remember we didn't buy drinks) but here's the best part...\n\nAfter dinner, they will stamp your left wrist that says \"Line Pass\".  Once you get this stamp, go outside of the restaurant and show it to the guy at the front door.  He will then give you a stamp on your right wrist (Chinese character) that will \"get you in and out of the nightclub as much as you want all night long, no waiting in line\".\n\nSo really, you can pay cover charge of $30 and wait in line for hours and hours (the line went outside the casino) or you can have a nice dinner and be able to get in and out all night long and not wait in line for an extra $22.  \n\nAnd by the way, i was pleasantly surprised with their food!  It was actually very good.  At first they said it was a la carte, so i thought their entrees would be small but surpringly they were not.  Take our word coming from five grown men that by the end of dinner we were actually pretty full!\n\nDinner was very good but the ' in and out as much as you want, no waiting in line ' option was VERY much well worth it !!"

We had all ordered fish ~~~ there was the Miso Glazed Chilean Bass, Soy-ginger glazed Salmon, and the Yellowfin Tuna. All were cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  I would definitely come back to try their other dishes.  \n\nService was decent for what it was worth. The place was crazy busy and we had plenty of libations at our table so we didn't really notice any lack of service... we were enjoying each others complany wayyyy too much. =)\n\nI hope i don't ever experience what people have written about this place....

As you walk in, you'll see a line of bathtubs filled with rose petals and lit candles on both sides of the entrance way. The entire restaurant is clean and dimly-lit. \n\nFOOD QUALITY: Don't expect anything grand here for what you pay for. It's basically over-priced Chinese, Thai, and Japanese cuisine food. It's like the equivalent of eating at Panda Express or at some other Asian cuisine food court restaurant, except you're paying at least 3x as much for it. But then again, this is a restaurant right on the Vegas strip in Palazzo, so this shouldn't come as a surprise. After trying a couple of dishes, the only item that was actually good and worth its price would be the \"Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables\" ($39.00). The fish's flavor and texture were excellent. \n\nSERVICE: I must say, our server Jeffrey was top-notch. He provided one of the best services I've ever had. Jeffrey was friendly, patient, and very easy to talk to. We had a group of 14 girls (bachelorette squad) and he was able to handle us like a pro. The bride's hair caught on fire from her dessert candle and one of the other servers who was passing by put it out within a second. Thanks for making sure our beautiful bride could return home to her fiance with a head full of hair.\n\nOVERALL EXPERIENCE: It's a good place to go to mainly for the atmosphere and service, just don't expect to be blown away by the quality of the food. Not saying the food was bad, it's just that you can get the same quality of food elsewhere for much cheaper. Also, there are so many better restaurant options in Vegas with high-quality service, atmosphere, AND food."

So, you get (what is in my opinion) some pretty decent Asian Fusion cuisine and attentive service in the restaurant marred by the typical nightclub attitude - \"self-important\" is the phrase that comes to mind.\n\nFirst and foremost, be sure not to stand in the wrong place.  My group of four were informed not to stand where we were standing three separate times in the first 20 minutes at the venue.  The first was when we were in line to check in for our 9pm reservation behind some other folks that were taking an impossibly long time at the host stand to notify the host of their arrival.  A \"welcome to Tao\" would have been nice but instead it was more like \"be sure to stand to the left if you have a dining reservation.\"  Gee, thanks.\n\nAfter being informed at the host stand that they were running \"a little behind,\" we headed to the bar to grab some drinks.  The end of the bar was open so we headed over there, but very shortly after ordering our $50 round we were informed by another bouncer that we couldn't stand at that side of the bar.  I informed him rather indignantly that we wouldn't even be in the bar in the first place if they were able to seat us in a timely fashion for the reservation we'd made a month ago.  So I took my time signing the check and then we headed to another area of the bar where we were told yet again not to stand where we were standing.\n\nThings got better once we were finally seated at our table - fortunately it was only a 15 minute delay which was marginally acceptable (in my opinion, any material delay when a reservation is involved should warrant some free drinks).  I do like the food here, even though several of the menu options are somewhat uninspiring (read: Kung Pao Chicken).  The sushi is good but overpriced and the shabu shabu is fun but easily recreated at home.  I think the small plates are probably where the best options lie, but you do need to order several of them to make a meal.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive - a nice contrast to the police state that was the bar area.\n\nIt was the food and ambience that brought me back a second time but I think I can find something comparable in Las Vegas on a future visit,  somewhere where they care a little more about friendly service and are not focused so much on cattle-herding the club kids."

The flavors were so bold and exciting and it was an amazing start to my dinner.\n\nFor my main course I had the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass. It seemed to be what most people recommended you order.  I do not like seafood in general, but when you go to places such as Tao, which are known for it, then you have to just trust that it will help with your misconceptions. And it really did. The sea bass was amazing...very light, flavorful, and not fishy at all. It was perfectly cooked on a bed of vegetables and had a very nice flavor profile.  Sadly, I couldn't even finish it!\n\nFor dessert...I believe it's an off the menu thing...but the Giant Fortune Cookie is a must. Depending on the number of your party, they'll put the appropriate amount of fortunes in it...most of them being sexual in nature and quite funny!\n\nAfter dinner, we waited for the manager to arrive so that we could get our hand stamped in order to get into Tao Nightclub without waiting in line.  All in all a great meal with some amazing food and flavor profiles!\n\nP.S. The bathroom is definitely interesting. While washing your hands, make note if you look at the gaps between the mirror and the sink, you can peer into the men's restroom and even see men standing by the urinals.

We confirmed earlier that we will be there and we come early and we STILL had to wait?!?!? Mind you that we have not eaten and we are all starving so, we were pretty frustrated....and after fifteen minutes....no pager action so we head to the front and ask when we will be seated. The host looked flustered and told someone to lead us to the table. Wow such \"wonderful\" service and it doesn't end there.\n\nWhen we finally got seated (also I was looking around when we were taken to our seats....there were plenty of open tables), I looked through the menu and decided what to order in like 5 minutes. I kept a timer near by me because I saw how much the waiter was passing us and it took them 20 minutes from handing out our menus to actually take our orders down. \n\nWhen we finally got our food, the only good thing about it was probably the plate it was on. I ordered the Thai roasted chicken. When I ate my first piece of it, I realized that the chicken was dry....not the way I like my chicken to be cooked. In addition, The chicken was coated with a ton of very sweet sauce. I tried using the sauce to moisten the chicken up but the sauce did not complement the chicken. I was very disappointed with that. I even a bite from my boyfriends food...Meh it was alright.\n\nMy overall review for this place, we came in at 9 and didn't leave until 11 due to waiting for service to come by. I think we spent probably a good 75% of the time just waiting. So what do i say about the service, that IT SUCKS! The food was not worth the taste or the price. I wasn't very pleased with the place and will not be returning to the restaurant to eat ever again."

I guess that it kind of won by default but we still liked it. \n\nThey have cool buddist projections on the dimly lit walls, and the hallway to the restroom is lined in buddist monk art. They should have named this place Buddist because of all the bodacious Buddist decor at every corner.\n\nAnyway, the only negative is that we tried to explore the upper level, but got denied because we didn't have a stamp on our hand. Not sure what that stamp was, or where to get it, but it was probably a buddah head. Oh well, we enjoyed ourselves anyway. But be forewarned that if you head in at the wee hours of the night, there are drunks o plenty who are full of brave juice and you'll have to either laugh em off or swat them away like flies! Either way it makes for some hilarious times!"

I imagine the build out must have been underwritten by the casino as a draw.  A normal restaurant probably would not have the cash to finance such a spectacular place.  Statues of Buddha adorn a very upscale place...A tip on the bathroom, the woman's room is nearest to the statue with the naked breasts\n\nSo my first thought is great place/horrible food like a RainForest Cafe, but this place really delivers great food.  The menu is all things Asian.  I guess we call that Pan-Asian.  You can eat anything from sushi to Peking Duck and beyond.\n\nWe split the Chilean Sea Bass, dumplings and duck, which were all incredible...The service was on the ball as well\n\nIf you are going to Vegas, this is a place worthy of visiting"

First of all, the hostess with the blonde hair and orange dress was a total petty bitch and did not want to seat us. Had us waiting for over an hour for a table when we saw several open. We would have at least ordered drinks and  appetizers but there was no service in the waiting area. The waiting area was blaring with loud EDM music, not at all conducive for dinner or lounge talk and definitely scared us a bit thinking that the club would be the same. Meanwhile, troops of people with questionable attractiveness and boldly comfortable physiques would trapes in every few minutes heading over to the nightclub area. We were already on the guestlist for the party but having had good history with their sister company, Lavo, we wanted to try the food first,  but in these moments, both the dinner and club scene here were so off putting. The night started off quite weak. Once we were seated, after 12, finally the service came pouring in. At least 3 or 4 servers came to our table to excuse the slackness and eager to be of service. Nice view of the big Buddha statue in the center. Food was decent, we enjoyed the pan fried chicken gyoza, the lobster wontons and the rock shrimp lettuce cups were ok, we kind of got full off of just appetizers cause again, large portions. My cousins miso sea bass entree was good. Strong miso flavor, but if you're cool with that, its good. Big portion of chicken pad thai by someone else. I dont like pad thai or peanut tastes so i didnt taste it but she enjoyed. Looked big and fresh. I split the shrimp, lobster, scallop in bean sauce entree with someone else because it sounded big and also to cut costs and have more things on the table to taste. Was really looking forward to it, it has all of my favorite meaty chewy seafoods. It was shockingly bad, dont know if there was an error made in the sauce recipe, but I have had plenty of similar dishes in the past, never have any been half as bad, and it came highly recommended by the waiter and was amongst the most expensive so we were surprised that it was so bitter. The table tasted and agreed that the sauce had an unpleasant taste. The waiter took it off of our bill gracefully and we left a great tip in exchange. In this moment, the great service that we are accustomed to from Lavo, was thankfully shining through here at Tao as well. A nice chick came to our table to stamp us and set us up for the complimentary club access. As I said before, we were already on the guestlist so didnt need it, but its nice that they have that additional incentive for dining there, as Lavo used to do. Will continue nightclub review in other yelp page."

He didn't, ask questions, never came to check on drinks even when he was right there. I am a reasonable person. If it was so busy and he was working very hard, I'd understand. Since he had enough time to stand at the back and observe, I would think he could make himself useful and at least refill our drinks. This is Vegas people, many, many, many better options. Do not waste your time or money on this place. There were three of us, no one liked their meals. It is also very loud, as it is part of a night club -- I didn't mind this part -- that was actually the fun part. What I didn't appreciate was where I was seated. They seated us at the back where the staff kept going in and out from, with dishes et al -- and every time someone would pass, most likely would knock into me. The rudest part was no one -- not even one person there apologized for doing so.  \n\nI am disappointed as after reading the reviews people have received good to decent service -- not in our case.\n\nYikes, save yourself the trouble and drop your dime elsewhere.

I did the sushi platter with the chef's selection. Your better off sticking close to the sushi chef's for an entertaining night. \n\nPersonally I suggest bringing a crowd that can appreciate a place like Tao. The whole enviroment inspires intelligent conversation and anything less seems to put a damper on the whole experiance. \n\nEven though I was a guest of Rich they STILL made me get a line pass and re enter just to go upstairs. I hear they make ppl pay to get in but they just let us walk up. Upstairs is cool. Naked women decorating the place is a perk. \n\nNot a place to get your dance on .....stick to the bar behind the wierd skully wall."

Then, our entrees were brought out before we finished our appetizers.  We were asked about dessert before the table was cleared.  It is unusual for four women not to want dessert, but we were just not up for any with the remains of dinner in front of us.  We did like the atmosphere.

We have never waited for our table...always when we have arrived we are immediately taken back.\n\nFood, and drinks each visit have been exceptional.  My husband has had the Hot and Sour soup with Shrimp Toast, Jasmine Rice, and the Chilean Sea Bass.  He LOVED them all.  I have tried the Orange Chicken (before I was GF), the Jasmine Rice, the Pad Thai rice noodles with chicken, and the Satay of Chicken with Peanut Sauce.  If I could get this food from home, I would be eating here once a week...without a doubt!  \n\nWe have had great service on each trip with an offer of a stamp to enter the club as a VIP after it opened for the night (bypassing the line, and the cover).  The Club is a different review, but also a definite must-see at least once while in Vegas.\n\nHINT:  To address the \"which is which\" that people seem to have trouble with at the bathrooms entry... there is a statue outside each door.  One has boobs, and one has a penis.  This seems pretty self-explanatory to me, and I figured it out for myself on my first visit, after a few drinks.  Seems like it shouldnt be such a big question?"

Want a celebrity sighting?  Want to visit a Vegas hotspot?  Tao is definitely a great choice at the moment in the fickle and ever-changing Vegas scene.\n\nThe food takes a number of dishes from Southeast Asia and moderates the taste for a Western palate.  Spices are generally mild, the ingredients are less exotic, and anyone who has eaten at a P.F. Chang's will feel very comfortable.  You really can't go wrong if you choose a number of small plates and share them family-style.\n\nI'd also highly recommend the sake flights, which give you a sampling for some very fine wines.  Oddly enough, you can't tell which is which, but does it really matter?\n\nThis is a great location for those large groups, although getting a reservation can be difficult.  It's a good thing that they have late-night seating up to 10:30 or 11:00pm.\n\nA note for those bachelor/ette parties - eating dinner at the restaurant does NOT get you into the club automatically, so plan accordingly.  It's still a good choice to eat downstairs and go clubbing upstairs afterwards (because you avoid an extra taxi ride in between dinner and partying), but you need to make reservations at both locations BEFORE coming out, otherwise you risk having to wait in line."

The wise and skilled waiter (Jake) sagely suggested that we set an approximate cost per person of around $70 or so (not including drinks) and he bring out multiple entrees and serve family style. We had a few vegetarians in the group.\n\nThis plan worked very very well. The vegetarian dishes (kung pao tofu, spring rolls, vegetable dumplings, sake-flavored mushrooms) were all quite good. The Sea Bass skewers were out of this world. Also quite good were the lobster dumplings. Service was excellent at all times, though this might have been influenced by a VIP in our group. B/c said VIP among other stuff we were treated to sushi, some apps and a dessert platter with a giant fortune cookie stuffed with yum, ice cream, apple dumplings, pocky, and stuff similar to cannolis. The dessert was good, but definitely not the best stuff that this place has. If you are looking to save money, skip dessert here.\n\nPerhaps our experience was not normal b/c the VIP on board, however the food, ambiance as well as the great wine/liquor menu justify a splurge here. If your waiter is half as good as Jake, you will be 100% satisfied."

Its hip and loud inside. Not ideal for a romantic setting but highly recommended for those dining with friends. We had dinner reservations at 10pm on a Thursday night but wasn't seated til 10:45 so we hung out at the bar and had a few drinks. The place is packed! Apparently its the cool place to be for a Thursday night according to the host. The men there are very aggressive. My fiance' had to be on me so that they would stay away.\n\nAfter being seated, we had our food within minutes. They have great service other than the wait which is totally understandable. Everyone is very polite and eager to please. They are also attentive to your needs. Someone would go by our table every few minutes to refill drinks or to make sure everything was ok.\n\nFood is AWESOME and cheap! I had Wok Seared NY Sirloin which was yummy til I tasted fiance's Chilean Sea Bass which made me cry. Im salivating as Im typing right now reminiscing of how good it was. We are both fish eaters because he sport fishes every weekend. Fish dont really impress me til I had this sea bass. I dont know how they cooked it but it tasted like fish flavored butter. Soooo goood!!!! We had the giant fortune cookie for desert and it was awesome! It had fruits around it one of them being lychee. A fruit I havent eaten since I left Manila. Fiance' has never tasted it but loved it! It brough great nostalgic memories of my childhood. =)\n\nThe restroom is confusing but theres a very polite guy who directs you where to go. Going to and fro the restroom: ladies beware. Men seem to pop out of nowhere and hit on you. Its annoying when you have to go pee really bad.\n\nA Tao employee was going around giving free wrist stamps for people that ate inside the restaurant so they can go in the club upstairs. We decided to check it out since we're already there. The club was huge but packed! Im glad we didnt have to wait 2 hours in line and pay just so we can be pushed around inside. Great scene for single people looking for a vegas hook-up.\n\nIn a nutshell:\nGreat food and service\nNot ideal for romantic dinner\nGreat for people in groups (pre-game dinner)\nEat at the restaurant if you want to go in the club so you can save money and not stand in  line\nClub is great if youre single and looking for a hook up\nIf youre going there with a date its best to get bottle service so you can have a place to sit and relax"

I shared the wasabi-encrusted filet mignon, sea-bass, fried rice, and salmon with udon noodles.  The rice wasn't anything special but each of the other dishes was delicious.  The sea-bass was amazingly cooked and the filet mignon hit the spot.\n\nWe had a group of 15 and the service was ultra-efficient and super smooth.  I'm a huge fan of the decor of Tao nightclub, and can say the same holds true with the design of the restaurant (tho it is a bit dark.)  \n\nThe servers were super friendly to us and at the end of the night as a perk for eating there, we got VIP stamps to get into the club.  And I'm not talking about \"VIP\" status where you get into a \"VIP\" line and wait another f-ing hour.  At 10PM we left the restaurant and were in the club in under 10 minutes even though a line was building up outside.  Considering I spent about $40 on the food, and entry into the club would have been about $20 anyways...well that's what I think anyone would call a good deal.\n\nIf you're going to come and complain about the \"noise level\" take a pause and think about it.  What do you expect from a resaurant sitting below the club (with the same name, mind you).\n\nThe only weird thing to me now is that two of my favorite places in Vegas have the same place ..Tao and Tao.  Nightclub and restaurant."

If you are looking for a great dinner in Las Vegas I highly recommend. If you are a large party be aware even for a massive restaurant they only have a limited amount of tables that can accommodate a party of 8. \n\nEnjoy! (photos loaded of yummy sake)"

Not so much for a romantic night.  \n\nI've been to Tao New York few years ago and was not so impressed by fancy expensive Chinese food.  It was just a place that I can say \"Yeah, I've been there\" and not return again.  Somehow I found myself here in the deviation also known as Las Vegas' version.  The best way I can describe Las Vegas spun versions restaurants (ie Mesa Grill, Delmonico, David Burke, Koi, etc etc) is large productions, lacking heart and character in its food.  Mass production?\n\nWe ordered the miso glazed salmon which was fine, the size of the fish was beyond my expectations (insert my mass production epiphany), spicy toro tartar on crispy rice.... a nice attempt at copying Koi's signature dish but fell short on the crispy rice, it was too thick so the crispyness did not stick together but fell all over my plate.... some Filet Mignon yaki udon dish that really made me miss Oh! Taisho's kimchi yakiudon but I digress.\n\nIt was a very bland dining experience.  The only good thing - we were able to receive comps to Tao Nightclub."

Bussers constantly hoover around like ninjas to clear items right away making me feel rushed but I'm sure its because they have a lot of reservations.

I suppose with the economy, Vegas is hurting too so he's gotta \"make it work\".  Other than that, here's the rundown:\n\n-Sushi:  We shared a few rolls for appetizers and they were good, but definitely $$ for the portion.  We had a spicy, crunchy tuna roll and something else with yellowtail; like I said, good, but I've had better at Sushi Wabi in Chicago.  \n\n-Drinks:  Sake martini, waaaaay too heavy on the vodka.  Left a stinging sensation in my mouth and not in a good way.  The other tini's were on the sweet side.  \n\n-Dinner:  We had peking duck for two...MUST try.  It was tender, flavorful and a great portion size.  Friends had chicken curry, nice and spicy and chilean sea bass, also delicious.  I thought the entrees were all reasonably priced, especially for Vegas.  \n\n-Atmosphere:  Lots of typical d-bags yelling \"Vegas Baby!!\" and lots of typical chippees in slutty outfits (us included).  But overall, no complaints.  We were seated on time, the service was efficient (our food came out really fast!) and $110 per person (dinner for six, split 5 ways for b-day girl) seemed like a pretty good deal for as much as we ate and drank."

But what can we do when NYE is in less than 36 hours? Where we go that isn't too far from home, yet not so close? Where can we party til the sunrises? \n\nSIN CITY! \n\n*Ding, ding, ding, DING!*\n\nWho would have known the four of us were locked, loaded, and ready to go within 12 hours after saying yes. After three and a half hours of driving, we finally arrived.  we made managed to sweep dinner reservations just a few hours beforehand. After we finished dolling up for the big night, we spent the next hour finding parking at the Venetian parking lot. The staff was kind enough to hold our reservations, even though we were 30 minutes late. \n\nWhen we got to the restarant, we were greeted by a female hostess, who seated us immediately. She was HAWT (full blown double dees and a badonkadonk). We were given warm towels to wipe our hands and given menus. We started off with a Satay of Chicken with Peanut Sauce ($10) as an appetizer.\n\nPlease do yourself a great favor and order these two items:\n\n- Crispy Filet of Red Snapper with Spicy Thai Peanut Sauce ($29)\n- Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ($34)\n\nBoth plates were cleaned completely. If I was home alone, I would have licked the plates off. \n\nShame on you if you don't try these two dishes out!\n\nIn my 23  years of existence, I have never EVER ordered fish from a restaurant because I was born a lean, mean, meat-eating machine. However, after my wonderful experience at Tao, I've opened up my palete and ventured into fish entrees.\n\nOne of my friends ordered the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon with Tempura of Onion Rings ($36), which is just okay, but not nearly as delectable as the sea bass and red snapper. I'd have to delete one star for that because at that price, I would expect it to taste better. \n\nAll of the cocktails are $12.5. Try the Blue Zen (Cruzan Citrus, Malibu Rum, Blue Curacao, Pineapple Juice).\n\nThe desserts range from $9-12. Our waiter highly recommended the Giant Fortune Cookie (filled with white and dark chocolate mousse). Four people can share this. \n\nEvery bite of the red snapper, sea bass, and giant fortune cookie were sensually pleasing to the palette. The only words we can utter were \"mmms\" and \"ahhhs\" throughout the entire meal. \n\nI have yet to try the sushi the next time I come here again. Hopefully, it will be soon."

If I hadn't come here with gift cards I'd have been super pissed. The food would be 2- or maybe 3-star material if it was 1/3 the price, because given the quality of the filet mignon in my main dish I promise you it wasn't worth the $40 they're asking. Serving sizes are also small at any price, but especially for the prices they charge.\n\nThe filet is actually 7 or 8 very small pieces of meat, maybe the size of a McDonalds chicken nugget. The whole dish is covered in an extremely artificial just-came-out-of-a-box tasting sauce, and the peppers lack flavor. The chicken that my fianc\u00e9 ordered had potential and she was happy with the way it was cooked, but it was overall \"only okay\" as she says. I had a taste and hated it, but that was just the flavor. Not something I would have ordered. Also, I was probably jaded by my garbage steak already.\n\nWe ordered a side of pork fried rice also. This was a semi-bright spot on the night. The rice was very good, and there were a lot of vegetables which we liked. Big fans of veggies. But the pork in the rice was bad. It was small chunks and also tasted and felt like it had come right out of a box and popped into the microwave.\n\nNow the sushi was amazing. I don't remember what it was called but it was their special for the day or week or something, and included salmon, real crab, avocado, caviar, ginger (I think), and a spicy-ish sauce. This roll was absolutely delicious, and I devoured it in like 5 minutes.\n\nAs a side note, the service was good. The waitress could have stopped by a little more frequently but it wasn't a big deal overall. She was very nice and our order was correct and our drinks were eventually filled.\n\nI have money left on my gift card after paying $150 for some of the most mediocre, fast-food level, processed tasting, overall low quality steak I've had in a long time. I'll use it for sushi or drinks but after it's used up I definitely won't be back."

I get that you make money off of tips, and that you're getting an automatic 20% off our large party, but really?  If you give me a good service, I'll tip above and beyond the 20% you talk on automatically.  Guy was a bit clueless too, when someone mentioned we were Korean, he was wondering if there was anything Korean inspired on the menu . . . either the staff isn't trained well, or he's just bad.  The food is Asian fusion, with strong Chinese influences, and a bit of Japanese and Thai thrown in.\n\nAnyway, the food was okay - the prawns were over-cooked, but the beef was good, and the eggplant was delicious.  Edamame was good, but that's hard to screw up.  On the other hand, the prices were exorbitant for the quality and small portion sizes.\n\nWith as many options as there are in Vegas, I don't see myself returning on any future trips . . ."

Also, for Vegas, the prices were very reasonable. \n\nI was actually surprised some dishes were in the $12-18 range. They obviously had some more expensive, seafood centric dishes, but that's certainly to be expected. They like to emphasize the family style dining here encouraging people to try multiple dishes. We had about 9 people at our table, and everyone enjoyed their dishes very much. \n\nThey are Asian fusion, which blew up 10 years ago, but good food is good food. Sometimes you handle the basics and let the trends fall where they may."

The waited did hook us up with a tasting menu for the table which for about $70 a person proved to be plenty of food with a wide variety of dishes to try.  The sea bass skewers were by far the best dish we had, all agreed.  The lobster pad Thai was good but the lobster was tougher than lobster should be.  I wish there was more sushi because that wasn't bad at all but all there cooked items were marginal.

            "review": "When planning my trip to Vegas, this was one place I had heard a lot about and thought I needed to try.  So, we booked reservations a week in advance through Open Table. \n\nI knew the place was trendy, and in my experience, trendy means pretentious and disappointing.  My first impression, by the automated response I received from Open Table was not great.  The message they send back asks that you please call the restaurant the day of the reservation to confirm.  Isn't that their job???  I was kind of offended.  \n\nAnyway, I called to confirm and they were abrupt on the phone.  We got to the restaurant and had to wait in line to check in for our reservation.         Once at the stand, I was given a buzzer and told that I needed to wait.  So, we waited 10 minutes.  There's good people-watching, but I'd rather be seated right away then wait when I have a reservation.  \n\nWhen the buzzer went off, we went back up to the desk and this time the man was overly kind, as many people in Vegas had been.  He thanked us profusely for waiting, told us that he really hoped we enjoyed our night, and the rest of our stay.  We were escorted to the perfect table on the second level over-looking the 3-story Asian figure sitting on a koi pond in front of a wall of candles.  It was gorgeous.  The waitress was really sweet and about 10 minutes in, we were seated with out menus closed and a manager came up and asked us if we were waiting on the waitress of if she was waiting on us.  We told him not to worry that we were relaxing.  He told us that if there was anything he could do to make our meal more enjoyable, we should let him know.  Again...so nice...totally unexpected. \n\n In typical fashion, I over ordered.  We had edamame (cold with shaved ginger and sesame seed in maybe sesame oil?)...they were okay, not great.  We also had tempura avocado (I'd never seen that before, and I don't generally like the taste of warm avocado...it wasn't different this time) and zucchini.  And...because I'm a hog and needed 3 appetizers, we ordered the garlic and lime stuffed shrimp, which I was looking forward to most of all.  They were probably the biggest disappointment.  The shrimp tasted like they'd been frozen, and they stuffing was, more than anything, breadcrumbs.  Hell, they weren't even stuffed...more like patted on top of the shrimp. \n\n For entrees we ordered the filet (B) and Thai seafood stew.  B thought his filet, was good...not as good as at Delmonico, but still good.  It was served with onion rings (one of the better things served).  The seafood stew had a generous portion of seafood:  crab claws, shrimps, clams, lobster, and squid.  The broth was okay, flavored with cilantro and thai basil.  It was a clear broth, though, which wasn't what I was expecting.  Due to the order ordering at the beginning of meal, there wasn't room for dessert.\n\nOverall, 4 stars for great service, 3 for food."

But I come here for one reason, and one reason only.  CHILEAN SEA BASS.  This place has orgasmic fish-orgy-in-your-mouth watering CHILEAN SEA BASS ($34).  I look forward to eating this dish every time I go to Vegas, simply accompanied by a side of white rice.  I also had some $14 appetizer of tuna tartare which was delicious but I could have done without.  Topped off with a nice bottle of Sake and we kicked off the night right.\n\nI was a little apprehensive about eating here with my friends on a bachelor party trip.  The thought of 10 guys eating at Tao together late night made me think like we'd look like a bunch of freaks, but literally every table there was a large group of males or females, but not both.  Makes sense right?  No one wants extra baggage in Vegas.\n\nLast point....when you order water you better say tap or they're gonna bring you some Voss and charge you $7 for it."

Unfortunately we had reservations for 10 and they put us at a table that in no way should have held more than 6 or 8.  I have never been so cramped in all my life at a dinner.  That is a minus for this review.\n\nAfter trying about 10 different appetizers at our table, I was probably hovering around a 3-star review.  The food was average for Asian food at best.  What do you expect, right?  It's an restaurant with food from all different Asian cuisines, probably not doing any of them real justice.  Then I got my entree which was miso seabass.  OMFG.  I eat lots and lots and lots of fish and seafood.  When I go out to eat, that's pretty much all I ever eat.  The fillet was over 1\" thick and cooked to absolute perfection.  It friggin' fell apart with hardly any pressure of the fork.  The miso was perfect.  Just a light coating which really enhanced the flavor of the fish itself instead of drowning or masking the taste of the fish.  So the hero of the plate?  The fish.  Ding ding!!!  We have a winner.  So many times I get fish and the hero of the plate is the sauce on top.  If you have a very fresh fish cooked properly the sauce should be mild and minimal.  I was jumping for joy.  Seriously, I've had miso cod and miso seabass and this has to be the best I've ever had.\n\nLuckily for me before ordering the entree, I told everybody I wasn't interested in sharing.  I had enough beef and other types of meat in the appetizer round that I had no interest in anymore.  Nobody else wanted to order fish or real seafood, so I didn't try any of the other entrees.  I'm so glad - the fish was put on my plate from heaven.\n\nOthers at the table that were sharing their entrees were saying the pepper beef was really good, too.  I had no interest in trying it.\n\nIf I went back, there's no way I'd even try another entree because quite honestly, I doubt it will be anywhere nearly as good.  The appetizers were average - 3 stars.  However, the fish was a 5++++ star, so that averages out to 5 star.  I have a strong feeling that most of the entrees are not nearly as good.  I'll never find out because I'm not going to try them!  Based on what I saw others eating and their responses, they seemed to think the entrees were of similar level as the appetizers and were just decent."

But alas, this is a review of a restaurant, so the actual food is important too.  Typical asian fusion stuff....a mix of a wide variety of asian dishes.  If you don't know what asian fusion is, think about it this way....you can order sashimi (Japanese), pad thai (thai), satay chicken for appetizers (thai), and then throw down some shrimp, sea bass, spicey tuna rolls, kung pao, etc.  Oh yeah, avoid the sashimi....we're talking 4 small leaflets worth for $60.  The food is decent, but nothing special.  The environment goes along way (great place to take your special someone or a bunch of friends)...but the food is nothing to rave about.  Remember, it's definitely on the pricey end.  If you're considering a few appetizers, some drinks, maybe a bottle of sake, an entree for you and your sweatie, and then some dessert to close the deal, we're talking $100 each, easily.\n\nAnd please, please don't go here just to get a free line pass for Tao, the club.  It's not worth it.  Why pay $100 per person for a mediocre dinner just to get into the club?  And besides, if you're part of a sausage fest, you'll still have to pay cover and still wait a bit in line.  And if you cheap out on the dinner (where your main motivation was to get into the club and it's obvious), the server doesn't have to hook you up.\n\nAnd once you're in, you're screwed because Tao is geared towards table service.....unless you enjoy being packed like sardines (well I suppose if there were two girls and you.....).  Anyways, think about it...$100 for dinner, $ for cover, and then a whole bunch of $ for drinks. ...and standing the whole time and being very uncomfortable.  Or spending $200-$250 each person for bottle/table service, depending on how many are in your group.  It's a no brainer.\n\nSo back to the Tao restaurant....great environment good vibe, cool place to eat......average food."

I felt he did a much better job with the descriptions than what was on the menu so be sure to ask questions about the food prep.  We started with sweet potatoes tempura and veggie spring rolls, both were lovely.  Then we moved on to the pepper filet udon noodles which were a more flavorful lo mein and the XO shrimp with extra spice which had green beans, shrimp, rice all in a spicy, bean sauce.  The shrimp dish was the best Asian dish I have ever eaten.  For dessert, we went with the donuts with the dipping sauce which were a great finish to a great meal.  Great, knowledgeable and helpful service."

It's not too expensive so the average person can go and have a nice meal. When you finish they will walk you over to the club with no cover if you just want to hang without a table. I would definitely recommend a table but they are always pricey so if it's not in the budget just walk over early enough that you can stake out a spot bc it will get busy and crazy. I wouldn't say this was 4 or 5 star cuisine like you may be thinking of at a fancy shmancy place but I'd say my over all satisfaction rating would be a 4!"

A promoter gave me and my girls bracelets for free drinks upstairs from 10pm-11pm and we managed to get one drink before being seated for dinner.\n\nThe food was good as usual (see pics):\n* Chicken satay with peanut sauce ($10)\n* Soy ginger-glazed salmon with udon noodles ($26)\n* Unagi (one for $5)\n* Uni (one for $8)\n\nMay seem like a lot of food, but bear in mind that the portions are very small.  You're paying more for the ambiance, I would say. I also tried their Tao-tini ($13), which was good and strong.  ;-)\n\nAlthough the initial plan was to dance the night away at Tao Nightclub, our \"new friends\" from Tryst invited us to Marquee Nightclub at the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  We took them up on the offer since it's the new \"IT\" club, and we didn't have to wait in line or pay cover.  However, in hindsight, even though we had a good time at Marquee, I wish we had stayed at Tao."

I had the wasabi-crusted filet mignon. This was to die for...I'm still thinking of it as I type! The wasabi gave the beefiness of the filet the perfect edge. I scarfed it all down!

Having dinner at Tao gets you easy entry into the club, which was perfect for us since we needed to eat and hate lining up. We showed up for our 9:15 reservation and instead of being seated were handed a buzzer to let us know when the table was ready. I realized this meant there would be a wait so we sat at the bar and ordered two Kirins (the bartender looked slightly disappointed that we didn't want cocktails but it's 2016 and I don't do lychee martinis anymore). The wait wasn't exactly short but not long enough for us to finish our beers. When we were finally seated, our attentive server Mike told us the specials and we were immediately sold on the pastrami fried rice. We also ordered lobster wontons with shiitake ginger broth and Chinese five spice short ribs. I honestly didn't have very high expectations but it was all pretty tasty and we were quite satisfied. We ended our dinner with key lime doughnuts, another yummy special. After we settled our check, we asked Mike about access to the club and a lady and black soon came over to stamp us wrists for entry. We then just had to go back out to the entrance to have our IDs checked, then we circled right back into the club - no lines, no muss, no fuss. I've had far more difficult entries to Tao before so I thought this was a really great deal. The club experience itself was not super stellar - the DJ seemed to have a playlist from 5 years ago - so we left after just one round of drinks. But it was well worth having a good dinner and a brief club interlude just to round out our Vegas experienc"

Odd to me, to have clubbers and people eating at the same time. Our server was nice and was attentive with everything. The music from the club was pretty good. I didn't imagine myself actually eating a meal in a club type atmosphere, but it was upbeat and something different. The food was okay. Sushi was pretty good. The hot and sour soup was probably the best I've ever had. The lobster dumplings were also very good. The sauce it came in was perfect. The drinks were surprisingly tasty. Enough alcohol for you not to complain about it yet still had the flavors of the drink. Wasn't too expensive, which was good on my pocketbook. The d\u00e9cor was beautiful.

I ordered the Giant Fortune Cookie, Chocolate Spring Rolls with kalamansi sauce, and a pot of Hong Tao tea. \n\nSpring Rolls: If I think I could make something better than what I ordered, we're off to a bad start. These are just some little rolls filled with average-tasting chocolate (did the cooks in the back just melt a bunch of Hershey's kisses to make this? I was expecting fancy chocolate! Willy Wonka grade A chocolate). The kalamansi sauce wasn't that tart. Not even sure if that would've helped bring out any flavors in those spring rolls. They just didn't complement each other like I was expecting. \n\nGiant Fortune Cookie: Like the name suggests, it's a giant fortune cookie. The cookie is filled with milk chocolate and white chocolate cream. You also receive two naughty fortunes. I enjoyed the naughty fortunes more than the cookie.\n\nHong Tao tea: has a subtle peach flavor, and the menu noted how it pairs well with dessert. I should've brought my own box of Celestial Seasonings tea instead, cause this tea wasn't worth my $4.00 (could've bought two boxes of Celestial Seasonings teas).\n\nSERVICE\nOur waiter barely visited our table to ask how we were doing.

Some guests were just saying bring out food, anything will do. \n\nThe line for the night club portion was piling up and packing the staircase which was horrible because it became a major task just to get to the restroom on the 2nd floor.  Security initially told the girls that was the only one while we were initially waiting to be seated so we did not know any better that there was a restroom on the main floor. \n\nA girl came around and stamped our wrists and told us this is to get into the club upstairs after we finish dinner which seemed like a cool option that the restaurant seemed to give patrons and we decided that we would stay for the club after dinner instead of hesding out to Ballagio.  This later became a ridiculous ordeal because as we went up the packed staircase with our entire party the bouncer at the top stated that the stamp now did not give us admission but got us past the line outside. He told us to all go to the front door. \n\nThe look of disgust on the birthday girls face summed it up and trying to patronize the place further would just lead to further aggravation. \n\nThe only reason I gave this place one star is because the food was really good but I can't be really sure because when you are starving anything tastes good and some of the girls last meal was around noon so we were pretty hungry."

Here is the beef & reef sampling that I picked up along the line:\n\n- A piece of miso glazed Chilean sea bass (Delighted my taste buds. Superb.)\n- A slice of wasabi-crusted filet mignon (Tender. Vibrant. Absolutely delicious.)\n- Chicken in hoisin sauce (Just okay. I've had better at Saigon Grill here in Manhattan)\n- Pad Thai noodles (Mildly nutty. Tender noodles.

I was baffled, maybe we didn't pay attention to what we ordered but I know for a fact that we did not have that many (alcoholic) drinks to amount to $300. The food was rather bland and felt as if it had been prepared in a rush, and mind you we were starving. We all know that food while in the starving stage tastes amazing!!! Oh no, not at TAO. The decor is fancy, very nice, but it's a cover-up for their nasty food. The waiter was really cool, attentive, and friendly. Plus he was from Compton! Heeeeey, I'm from LA."

However, when we arrived there, we were informed by our server that we must each order 1 entree from The Sea, The Land, or The Sky, or 2 rolls, which would be 25+ for each. Didn't turn out to be a big deal because everyone was pretty hungry. \n\nI would definitely recommend the miso glazed sea bass. It was delicious! But be sure to order a side or rice because it'd be too sweet without it. \nThe orange chicken doesn't resemble anything from Panda Express and comes in a large portion with a side of rice. Not bad, but I'd prefer the sea bass. \nThai Buddha Chicken is a mystery. I am not quite sure what it is exactly, but it was juicy and tasty nontheless. \n\nAnd we got our stamps and got into the club with no troubles for the rest of the night. The dinner average out to about $40 / person."

We got two bottles of Jameson \n\nYou have the option to choose your own three course meal OR you can do a family style dining where you get a large portion of EVERYTHING on the menu. We went with the family style and it was extremely worth it. We got huge portions of each course.\n\nFor appetizers we had the temple salad, sea bass, and chicken gyoza. The salad had to be my favorite of the three. The sea bass was also very delicious.\n\nFor the entree we had the salmon, coconut shrimp, and orange chicken. I wasn't a big fan of the salmon and i don't think anyone else was either. The shrimp however was a big hit, i really enjoyed the size and the peanut curry glaze! I had about two of them and I was already full. The orange chicken had good flavor but it was really dry like the chicken was over cooked.\n\nFor dessert we got fried chocolate spring rolls, yoga sugar dusted donuts, and seasonal fresh fruit with mandarin ice cream! The fresh fruits came with kiwis, blueberries, mangoes, grapes, blackberries, strawberries, and raspberries! The donuts were really good and tasted fresh. I wasn't a big fan of the spring rolls with dark chocolate like inside. \n\nAfter every course, the servers would come by and change our plates and utensils. The food came out quickly which is definitely a plus!\n\nOverall, if you go with a group of friends I definitely recommend the dinner style! you get to try all the goodies AND it comes with huge portions!"

But for those not staying at the Venetian and want to go to Tao club afterward, dining there will get you a vip pass to skip the long lines.\n\nNow the food part. The lobster wontons were AMAZING.  I know it sounds odd, but every bite was like a taste of lobster heaven.  The sauce concoction was just incredibly delicious. I also had curry chicken and sirloin steak (forgot the correct entree names), which were good but not great. I guess without the lobster wontons, I'd give Tao a 3 star."

The food was mediocre and the service was completely horrible. I would be more adamant in refusing to come back except I'm probably not going back to Vegas anytime soon anyway.\n\nMy friend made a reservation at Tao for a late dinner. Some members of our group were a little late, but still made it to the restaurant before our reservation was cancelled. For no particular reason, the waitstaff at Tao decided that the appropriate action was to make our group wait before seating us. During the 1+ hour wait, my friend kept going to the host to find out the table situation, as the rest of the group watched patrons finish their meals and the restaurant clear out. Partway through our wait there were numerous empty tables, yet it took another 15-30 minutes to be seated.\n\nMy friend complained to the manager of the restaurant, who apologized profusely and brought over our waiter, and made lavish promises to make up for the ordeal our group had been through. They promised free shots, a couple free appetizers, and \"special service\" from the chef. Well, we received the free shots and some edamame. I never figured out what the \"special service\" was... \n\nOverall, the experience flat-out sucked. Food was okay, but that's probably only because I was starving by the time it arrived at the table. The time we saved waiting in line was negated by the wait for a table. And if the manager makes an apology I expect him to HONOR it."

This worked so well!!  Let's do it again for the soul-less, culture-vapid city of Vegas!!\"  Well, lightning struck twice, and in 2005, Tao Las Vegas opened its doors to brainless celebs like Britney Spears, Tara Reid, and of course, Paris Hilton.  With the \"icons\" of our generation flocking to this mega power club, the lemming touristas followed blindly.\n\nThe masses consumed the wholly uninspired and overpriced food without blinking an eye.  They drank their cutsey sake-tinis and munched on the half-assed sushi bar under the watchful eye of the 20-foot Buddha.  They shook their bodies to the thumpity-thump electronic muzak like Massachusetts Shakers on Sunday mornings.\n\nMy visits to Tao (a requirement of the job) have led to some realizations.  Perhaps I'm too old and out of touch with what's hip nowadays.  Maybe I've entered the second phase of my life and have become a \"fuddy-duddy\".  Or maybe, just maybe, I'm immune to the brain-washing of the 20-foot Buddha.\n\n**This would've been a 2-star review if I hadn't scored a pic with Tiffani Faison (of Top Chef season 1)  while visiting almost 2 years ago.  It was approximately 2 weeks before the Top Chef final and surprisingly, she was still serving food at Tao.  She was gracious and sweet."

If you'd like to go to the night club (which I definitely recommend!) ask your waiter to stamp you. You get free entry to the night club if you eat dinner at the restaurant."

The visual/decor of the restaurant is stunning, low lights, asian-pacific, tasteful and romantic.  Not many folks there at 5:30 which was fine.  The food in general was good, and the service was excellent.  I had a tequila and cucumber cocktail that was fabulous.  My soy-ginger salmon was heavenly!  The one disappointment was when my friend ordered the kobe beef skewer with shitaki mushrooms.  (She had never had kobe beef before, and not knowing better she ate a portion of it, along with the mushrooms- and remarked that it was \"good\").  I tried it and found it flavorful but chewy - something that kobe beef should never  be.  By the time we were able to point this out to the server, it was time for us to leave for our show and there was no time to order something else. No adjustment on the tab, either!  Lesson:  Don't order kobe beef unless you know the restaurant knows \"kobe\" beef."

That was the only negative of the meal.\n\nWe did not order a main entree but what we did order was the perfect amount for the two of us.

They were able to accommodate about 20-25 of us for dinner (though our reservations were for 11:30pm, but we made them at 4pm).\n\nI would say majority of us ordered the sea bass and majority of us would say, it was damn good! We also ordered a family style dish of some fried rice and that was good too. I was amazed at how good the food was. Quality of the fish was excellent. My only gripe is the portion we all got. It's not a big portion. If you come here hungry, you won't leave full, I'll tell you that. \n\nThe service here is excellent, great staff brought everyone what they ordered, cups were never empty, the brought us everything we needed... all while being in the dark. I have no idea how they got everyone their order without being able to see, but they did... and the fish  (sea bass) was cooked to perfection. \n\nWAIT... there's more! So we recently just found out that if you eat here you get entrance to the Tao night club too... without waiting! On top of all that, they gave us a free pass to Tao Beach the next day. What a deal! What would have cost us about 80 bucks (dinner, club entrance, beach entrance)... cost us the price of dinner."

My favorite dishes were the Lobster Wontons and the Sea Bass.  The seasoning was enough so that it's not too salty or spicy.

Overall the food was delicious but a bit pricey.  Our group of 4 people was perfect to share the different dishes.  The d\u00e9cor is unique with the large Buddha in the center, dimmed lights (you need a flashlight to read the menu) added a warm glow to the place.

Those are always fun and this would be the perfect place. \n\nThe theme here is pretty cool too. You've got the Buddhist stuff going on, it's very dark, and theres a giant statue on one wall.

Things to consider on this review:\nThis is a restaurant that claims to be one of the finest Asian Fusion bistro in the US so I should be rated accordingly since they are charging you accordingly.\nLooks: the place is beautiful, ambiance is perfect, they get a 10 here\nService: started good, I was greeted and assigned a table right away, restaurant was near full, once I sat it took 15 min for my waiter just to show and every time I wanted a drink I had to wait much lore than usual just for him to get my order, once ordered the drink came fast, so it was my waiter the cause of the delay.\nFood: I started with a Crispy tuna roll, it was ok, fresh good flavor but too simple, I've had much better tuna rolls in Fort Worth\nThen no had the ginger salmon, first I expected wild salmon not farm raised, it was well cooked though it came in pieces, one large a a couple around, not like broken but as if I got the bottom of the pile, again I am rating this restaurant accordingly to what they claim to be.. And charge. Flavor was good, i love ginger, but it was too intense, not even half through i couldn't finish it, it was too much ginger and garlic.\nDessert was vanilla ice cream with apples, the apple part was old and hard to chew, the I cream was perfection.\nDrinks: i ordered a beer, I was surprised they brought me the beer in a aluminum bottle and not even offered a chilled glass, made me feel like a red neck \nWould I return ?? NO specially with all the options in Vegas.\nHope this is useful !!"

We came here for a company Christmas Party so we had a big group... usually coming to restaurants is the worst because the waiters are overwhelmed and it makes you feel bad, but at TOA we had Jeffrey and not only was he a nice guy, but he was one of the best waiters I've ever had/seen EVER. Thank you for your hospitality Jeffrey! You made our night!"

            "review": "After watching an insanely trippy show by Elton John at Caesar's palace (I swear I needed drugs to fully appreciate that show)me, my sister, my cousins and their friends headed over Tao for a late (and I mean LATE - it was a 10:45pm reservation!) dinner. I was little bit skeptical about going to eat at this place.  First off, I'm from San Francisco - it's hard to top the taste of Bay Area Asian foods that sell for a cheaper rate than Tao, and 2nd - it was ridiculously loud because Tao night club is right above the restaurant.  We had a reservation and still had to wait about 30 minutes.  Fine... I got that it was busy.  But after not having dinner, and being a little loopy after the Elton John show - I wasn't a very happy camper and I wanted to bail.\n\nBut the dinner was for a birthday and I didn't want to disappoint by being a Crabby Patty.  So I dealt with it.\n\nSince we were a large group of 10, we were seated in a nice little alcove in the very back of the restaurant.  It was nice and cozy and I felt at ease.  Thank heavens we weren't in the middle of the restaurant where it was crowded. I was crabby enough as it was to have to deal with the lack of space.  \n\nWe had a nice view of Mike Tyson as he sat at the table behind us with a lovely female friend.  We tried to be slick in taking pictures of him as each one of us placed our order.\n\nWhen the food came out, I wasn't so impressed by the presentation but I figured I shouldn't judge by looks alone.  I ordered the Chicken Yellow Curry.  The smell was heavenly. I saw the little pieces of lemongrass in it. That was different for me. I've never had Chicken Yellow Curry with lemongrass. I poured some curry on my rice and took a spoonful... it was fantastic that I had to offer some over to everyone else for a taste.  The chicken potstickers on the table tasted fresh and succulent.  My sister had a beef dish that was just DIVINE.  But my favorite was the dish I ordered.  And today I still crave for that wonderful burst of flavor on my tongue.  As I always say... \"Party in my mouth...heeeeyyyyy!!!\""

Yet we waited almost an hour for our table!  We almost bailed then, but we were really hungry and Asian food sounded good. \n\nYou've crammed too many tables on the floor near the Buddha.  Our table was so close to the other tables, that some of us had to get out of our seats to let the servers by. \n\nYour servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.  We were charged about $40 worth of drinks we did not order.  We had a party of 7, yet we were charged for 8 sodas.  Only two people had a coke, without being offered a refill.  We had some bottles of Corona on our tab.  Corona?  Do people even drink Corona after the age of 18???\n\nOur server acted like he was doing us a favor by taking our order.

If this was all done in a lower price range bracket (one step down will do) it would be a 5 star easy.  I guess when the bill crawls over the $100 mark for two people I need to be dazzled and super impressed with every category.  Ambiance, service and decor get 4 stars.  The food 3.  Coconut Shrimp was great but the Wasabi Encrusted Filet Mignon was just OK.

I do recommend you come with a fair amount of people so you'll be able to sample a little of everything as it is family style portions. Items that stood out for me on the menu were the sea bass, shitake mushrooms, and udon noodles. Lots of mushroom which I like and you can taste a hint of the sake they used in it. The sea bass was very fresh, tender, a bit fishy though so if you don't like the fish taste, I wouldn't recommend it. And last but not least, the filet mignon was nicely peppered, grilled, and complimented the udon noodles well. All the other stuff we ordered like pad thai, kung pao chicken, or the lobster wonton didn't excite my taste buds. The kung pao chicken had more vegetables then it did chicken. Boo. The pad thai was dry and not enough sauce, also I found it odd to serve a Thai dish at a Chinese fusion restaurant. The lobster wonton were mediocre. Would have been better if they were smaller or maybe fried. They had too much filling and were soggy. The little fortune cookies they give you at the end are kind of fun. They're chocolate cookies with your not so everyday fortunes :) Service was amazingly fast, 3.5 stars for you Tao!"

Reservation was for 6pm, right before their dinner rush during CES, a very busy time in Vegas.  We arrived exactly on time and the restaurant was almost empty, so there was no excuse for their placing us in the worst seat in the house, directly overseeing the commotion below from the second floor at a narrow aisle where everyone would have to pass by on the way to their tables - imagine an aisle seat on an airplane.  I looked down at the first floor and saw plenty of tables with booths we could have been given, so I was starting to get agitated.  I looked up at the third floor and saw empty tables where we also could have been placed.  Strike one.  We ordered our dinner, a pricey sea bass and an even pricier lobster dish - the most expensive item on the menu at fifty bucks.  My dish arrived and was basically a sloppy mix of smelly spoiled lobster (very obviously not served fresh) mixed with fried potatoes and popovers and a ton of cilantro on top to cover it the way a cat covers its poop when it is finished.  Hers was an overly sweet sea bass slathered in sugar.  I have had to crack open lobster dozens of times in the past but was given the tiniest shell cracker to de-shell with.  Strike two.  I complained to the manager and was offered free dessert or champagne and declined both - I didn't want anything for free - I wanted what I asked for.  He could have offered to relocate us and did not.  Strike three.  I am never coming back!"

That saying, \"melts in your mouth\" was true in this case.  The spices complimented the fish, and it was cooked to perfection as well.  Each bite was ecstasy.  That's really the only way to describe it.  And as embarrassing at it is, there were moments where I literally closed my eyes to fully enjoy it (and so did the other girl that ordered it!).\n\nI had a bite of someone's sushi roll as well, which was also incredible; so fresh, and uh, last time I checked, Las Vegas is pretty inland, so... wow.

Lobster wontons, probably not the best choice, opt for something different.\n\nDefinitely trust what your server has to say... you can't possibly go wrong!"

The entrance to the restaurant itself was very unique! Walking into the restaurant there were bath tubs full of naked women tastefully covered in flowers. No pictures were allowed but I tried unsuccessfully anyway. We sat in the bar area until out table was ready and had a drink. The bartenders were helpful and courteous but the bar was very full. \nOnce we were seated for dinner we decided to share a meal of their lobster fried rice as well as the glazed salmon. Both dishes were absolutely delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly. However, we both thought the lobster fried rice was very salty and way too greasy. Their was literally a pool of grease in the bowl of rice which we were surprised they did not drain a little before serving it to us.\nAfter having dinner in their restaurant we were informed that entrance into their club was complimentary for all diners. This was a big plus because it allowed us to avoid the $30.00 per person cover charge.\nThe club was very much like the restaurant - beautiful and full of both naked and costumed woman but this time they were all dancing instead of lounging like the ladies in the bathtubs at their restaurants entrance. Like at the restaurant bar the club bar served very good drinks. Snoop dogg was the entertainment for the night I was there. When the club let out the staff surprisingly handed out flip flops to all the women. But on the downside the flip flops were all the same size but this didn't stop any of the women from using the slippers LOL. My friend said they were a relief from her high heels. I simply took mine home as a souvenir. The take home slippers were definitely a unique touch.\nThe only negative that I could recall beside the one size fits all slippers was the greasy rice but the rest of my experience was wonderful. I'd definitely return when I'm in Vegas again."

Last night I sampled the appetizer of steamed chicken potstickers (very tasty) and the fish hot pot main course, which was full of delicious shellfish in a lovely spicy broth that smacked of lemongrass, garlic, chili, etc. Sooo good. After finishing off the lobster, clams, scallops, shrimp and calamari that were floating around, I pretty much wanted to drink the bowl dry, the broth was that good. My date had the wasabi crusted filet mignon, which came with onion rings and a few greens. I tried a piece of his steak and it was a really tender, delicious filet. Our table was a group of 8 in total, and there was a special occasion to celebrate, so we asked what they could do -- they ended up bringing out a special sampler dessert for the table, replete with sparkler, and even wrote a message on the plate in chocolate sauce, as we'd requested. Even the dessert (a giant fortune cookie filled with vanilla and chocolate mousse, a mochi sampler, and ice cream), was really tasty."

The atmosphere is great and the food is incredibly flavorful and very well prepared. Sushi is high quality. Must try surf and turf roll. Miso glazed Chilean sea bass out of this world. Noodle and rice dishes are great. I have typically gone with a large group and we order the chefs taste menu. Not a bad selection to be had. Incredibly high quality restaurant with great food and a fun atmosphere. Highly recommended!"

This place is very well decorated and the staff is really friendly. We got seated since we made prior reservations. The restaurant was perfectly dimmed. We asked our waitress for recommendations since we have never been there before. Annie, our waitress recommended us 3 appetizers which was the Bao Buns, the buns were really soft and tasty it was filled with meat. The second plate was the spicy tuna with rice crisp, I really enjoyed this dish. The spicy tuna wasn't overly spicy and I really liked the crispy rice. The third plate was the lobster potsticker which was pretty good with its sauce that it's doused in. I really enjoyed all three plates. Annie was a great waitress, she always came to our table to check up on us and refilled our waters. My overall experience was just very pleasant."

Waited 15-20 minutes just for someone to acknowledge us and take our drink order. Here's a tip, put some better lighting in your place since your servers obviously cannot tell who has or hasn't eaten, received drinks, etc.\n\nAfter we (finally) received our drinks, we waited another 15-20 for the server to come back for the dinner order. We totally skipped appetizers because of this. I was disappointed because I really wanted to try a roll or three.\n\nFood came out within about 20 minutes. Everything was right. Flavor wise, it wasn't anything to scream about. I've had much better salmon dishes. He made a huge point about \"our salmon comes medium rare, is that OK?\" There was hardly any pink, so meh. The sesame glazed eggplant was a salt lick. Fried rice was OK and the cauliflower was the best part of the meal.\n\nI guess if you're in Vegas, this is how it is I noticed here and other places. Horrible service with high prices. Thank goodness the boss paid. I'll never go back."

The service for my event last night gets five of the biggest, flashiest, Vegas showgirl style stars you can even imagine.\nJust walking up, the zen almost washes over you as you wish that the tubs full of rose petals were actually there for you to soak in.  But then you remember it's Vegas, and that's nasty, and the pounding music hits you and you're not so zen.  Then you're just overwhelmed by the design of the place.  You walk into one of the most perfect lounge areas I've ever seen.  Tons of cuddly couches and areas to sit with friends, all bathed in a very sexy candlelit glow.  The better to enjoy your foofy, brightly colored cocktails in - maybe do a little canoodling.  Now THIS is a place I would definitely come to if I lived in the area.  I had something very blue - called the Blue Zin I think?  (That's what happens when you let bartenders make your drinks, but worth it, it was delish) And a BLUEBERRY cosmo which just might be the most beautiful tasting cocktail ever.  But yeah, they really should've used white cranberry juice instead of red.  I am totally stealing that drink as my own.\nAnd seriously, I cannot rave about the staff enough.  From setting up the event, to the execution, we were treated with kid gloves and doted upon the entire evening.  Our crowd had a great time and I was swimming in compliments for an event well done, and I know it was thanks to Tao and their dreamy staff (cutie patooties galore!).\nThe apps were fab (and not just because I set the menu) - I especially liked the duck, the triangular pork spring rolls,and the shrimp (which were not rubbery or chewy at all, but soft and almost flaky).  The food at the buffet was only decent, and the desserts just okay, but absolutely adorable (hence the one missing star overall).\nI would recommend this location for an event a million times over - they have plenty of nooks and crannies (or nightclubs or balconies overlooking the main dining room) to fit your group, and the know how to make sure your event goes off without a hitch."

The bill was pretty reasonable considering our drunk asses were ordering like everything was free : $75/pp including tax& tip and that's AFTER covering our 2 guests of honor's split. In addition to good food and cocktails, our late dinner reservations successfully secured complimentary access to the club without a wait in line. It feels so good to stroll past the sour faces lined up outside for immediate entry. Just eat dinner here people, it's that simple!\n\nThe club was as crowded as it used to be when Jessica Simpson still had a career. Ok, maybe it's not that popping but it was still a really good showing. Oh, but whats with all the birthday shoutouts every 3 seconds?

He was fabulous. When asking for recommendations he was honest and truthful offering an explanation as to why he felt the way he did about a dish. He was attentive, friendly and fun to interact with during our dining experience.\n\nNow to the food, we started with the Lobster Wontons, steamed and not fried and exquisite. The lobster was perfectly cooked, and the ginger broth was amazing, 5 wontons was a great starter, but left us wanting many more.\nI ordered the Wok Seared New York strip, it was seared to  perfection with a nice crust on the outside, yet tender on the inside. The sauce is bursting with strong Asian flavors that are a perfect accompianment.\nTony ordered the Omakase, which is sushi and sashimi and is the Chef's choice. He was thrilled with everything served on the plate. \n\nThe food was wonderful,so  we decided to break with tradition and order dessert, that turned out to be a good decision.

We ended up ordering the egg rolls,, Mandarin Sizzled Fried Rice with Roast Pork, and the Shrimp Tempura Spicy tuna Avocado and Soy Paper Roll.  The egg rolls were huge, I can easily see 4 people sharing this plate.  The filling was fresh and definitely a great way to begin the meal.  The sushi roll was very decent as well.  The spicy tuna had all the right textures and flavors.  My least favorite plate was definitely the fried rice.  The description on the menu indicated an explosion of flavors.  It was definitely still delicious but I guess I just wanted to be wowed.  On the occasion of my sisters bday, I ordered the fortune cookie for her.  Also, Please note that if you check in on yelp, the cookie is free.  Which was totally great because it is actually huge, delicious, and selfie worthy!

Asked a second time 5 minutes later and still no water. 10 minutes later my waiter appeared as we were done with dinner and has the nerve to say \"Is everything ok?\" Uhhh no.  Pointed out other server who did not help us to the manager and he said to us the server said \"Oh that's not my table I thought someone else would do it.\"   ARE YOU KIDDING?  F this place and everyone who works there"

If, however, you're on a family vacation in Sin City (what? Reserve your judgments, please) then you'll have to contend with terrible service and fairly mediocre food. My favorite dish was the wasabi-crusted filet with onion ring tempura, not because the meat was silky and tender (which it was - credit where credit is due) but because the onion ring tempura resembled an insane alien pod ship. But otherwise it took us half an hour for our tea to arrive, and I know it doesn't take half an hour to boil water. Or to steep tea. Or both. And the desserts were a royal disappointment - I mean people, Godiva chocolate should not be listed on a menu. It's not impressive, nor is it good, and - dare I say it - it's not even chocolate. I'd skip the dinner in favor of drinks where you can enjoy the real reason for going - bachelorette party watching."

Essentially P.F. Chang's with even more offensive interior decor, Tao's \"Asian\" food is basically designed for the lowest common denominator - the Midwestern palate.\n\nSpring rolls were okay.  Potstickers were okay.  Crispy orange chicken came straight from the cauldrons of Panda Express.  Soy ginger salmon was okay - the udon was a bit unruly though.  Desserts were excessive.  What the hell were they thinking with a chocolate-filled egg roll?  A bite guarantees an oral blast of too-sweet chocolate, versus that same blast recreating a chocolate necklace on your clubwear.\n\nBut yes, we did get to skip the Tao line.

I never understood the concept of loud music in restaurants, not condusive for normal conversation or hearing your waiter.

The service was great once the food started coming, but previous to that it was slow and it took some time to get our drinks. Lastly, if you go with a group, you may want to limit it to six people only because we had to cram in eight sizable guys around a table designed for six. There were other tables which would've worked, but the majority seemed setup for six."

Located at the Venetian, which is like a LEGO-land comprised of the Gritti Palace and the Royal Danieli with St. Mark's and the Grand Canal thrown in for good measure, Tao is a Buddhist temple amid this garbled baroque mess.  \n\nYou will need reservations here and expect to have a drink at the bar, which isn't all too bad considering the loads of eye candy hanging around, as if they are apart of the scenery, so you will be sure to see something that you like.  Take the opportunity to order a Grey Goose and soda, sit on one of the couches, and look at all the hot Asian broads w/their raven tresses and wasp-thin waists, and the European bitches in their Milanese high heels and tossed-boob salad exploding out of their wrap-dresses.  Yes, yes, tres chic, I know. \n\nThe dining room is dim, crowded, and there's a thousand conversations going on at one and the same time.  Not sure if I'd come here for a \"special occasion\" type of dinner, as in ask your girl to marry you or to tell your mistress you're married.  Our waiter was cool, reminded me of a SoCal dude, like he'd hang out in Venice Beach.  \n\nFor dinner we started off with the spicy tuna tartare and kobe beef shashimi - both were to die for (the tuna was crisp and crunchy, and the kobe beef was like eating Kobe Tai, go figure).  With our main course (we both got the miso glazed Chilean sea bass) we paired it up with the lobster and kimchi rice (again, an excellent choice). \n\nI'm a sake novice and was open to suggestion: we started off with the sake sampler, and with our dessert got the sake dessert sampler, I believe, and me and my bud both agreed that the cloudy Voices in the Mist was our least favorite - I walked out of here a bit rocked.  For dessert we opted for the giant fortune cookie.  \n\nIn the end, $244.00 for two before tip, which, in my opinion, isn't bad at all considering what we got.  Will definitely make it here again and do our best to revitalize the economy."

After hearing about this place almost every time I visited Vegas, I was quite excited about getting invited to a meal at Tao the last time I visited. Unfortunately, I was kind of let down. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the meal did have its high points and I saw a glimmer of what I had originally made this place out to be. They seated us relatively quickly for how absolutely packed the restaurant looked and a few of the dishes - particularly the albacore nigiri and green bean tempura - were pretty damn delicious. However, their jaunty service and sup-par special dishes left me wanting to come back for a do-over. \n\nAlthough the wait to be seated at the door wasn't bad, trying to catch a server (of which we had two who seemed to be quite distracted with their myriad other tables) took us quite a while for both our drink and dinner orders. Upon flagging one down, we placed our order (a few of her recommended favorites in the mix), and waited for our dishes.\n\nThe appetizer course - lobster wontons, green bean/avocado tempura, pork potstickers - was decent. The crispy green bean tempura and delicious sauce on the lobster wontons far outshined the heavy avocado tempura and chewy, thick pork postickers. Having ordered the miso glazed sea bass, crispy orange chicken , fatty tuna and chinese sausage fried rice as our mains, we eagerly waited the next course. While all the dishes were alright, none of them really stood out or made me want to come back and eat it again (but maybe that's not even the point with a gargatuan place like Tao?). The miso sea bass (a restaurant favorite) was cooked well, but a bit sweet. The crispy orange chicken was the biggest upset, as the promise of crunchy, tangy chicken was everything but. Neither crispy, nor flavorful. At 15 dollars an order, I was really counting on the fatty tuna to be the star, but was let down by it being a little warm for fresh nigiri and kind of floppy. The chinese sausage fried rice was good, but nothing worth almost $20. \n\nThe saving grace came at the end of the meal in desert form. That was the one plate we cleaned entirely.The molten chocolate cake with coconut ice cream... get this if you come here. As someone who just questioned above if they'd ever return, it almost made me want to come back for more."

The stone \"baths\" greet you as you walk to the hostess station...each time I've visited they have been filled with water, rose petals and candles. I've heard mention that there may be events where Buddha nymphs are soaking in the tubs...could be urban legend, could be wishful thinking by drunken pigs. Either way, I wish I was a Tao bath girl.... \n\nBut I digress...back to the food. Whether dining alone at the sushi bar, partying with friends, or starting at a special someone this place accommodates the mood. Dark wood, candle light, ginormous statues of the Buddha, fresh flowers, small medium and large Buddha statues abound. I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing the club - but dining here has been enough satisfaction. \n\nThe sushi is divine and overpriced...individual order are great but if you really want to be impressed, throw your credit card to the wind and go for the \"chef's special\". - otherwise known as sushi roulette in Vegas. You give them an amount to spend and then wait for monster plate. The sashimi of Kobe beef (think carpaccio) is glorious, buttery, melty goodness and even better with the smokey sauce that accompanies the avocado tempura (sin on a plate). \n\nPeking duck eggrolls, Sea Bass meal or satay small plate, scallops...you could spend forever savoring. The sake menu is amazing and must be sampled - probably the reason I have never gotten to desert. But then again, there are great places within the Venetian to venture to for liquid desert!\n\nIf you like Asian food or sushi it's a must visit for the food and the atmosphere.  And no, the swanky couches in the front room are not for the uncool to lounge upon and think they can order drinks from - bottle service only and all that goes with it!"

Call be biased or snobby, but I don't like to pay a lot for Asian food when I can get amazing food in Chinatown for half the price. \n\nBut I went along with it anyway. \n\nWe arrived a few minutes before our 7:45pm reservation. My friend (who knows more about the NBA than anyone I've ever met) caught sight of a small sign sitting outside the restaurant. The poster showed a just a pair of eyes and some small text. Of course, my friend recognized right away that these were no ordinary eyes. These were Lebron James's eyes. He read the sign with urgency. Turns out, Lebron was going to make an appearance at Tao Nightclub after eating at Tao Asian Bistro. My friend almost fell over with excitement. \"I don't care what it costs, that's where we are going afterwards.\" I laughed and agreed that we would inquire. \n\nWe walked through the hall of little basins filled with water and rose petals, and the hostess welcomed us immediately. \n\nShe walked us through the restaurant, which is dimly lit and has a huge Buddha on the first floor. The ceiling is decorated with large canvases of calligraphy writing. Stunning displays of portraiture line the back wall and restroom hallway. The hostess seated us on the second floor. The ambiance was just the right combination of bustling, formal/casual, and you know, that Vegas \"je ne sais quoi\". \n\nOur waiter appeared promptly. He gave excellent cocktail and entree suggestions, and when asked, informed us that I (as a lady) would get in free to the Lebron party, and my friend would pay about $25. Which I'm sure was deeply discounted. Not only that, but we got stamps on our wrists to bypass the line. \n\nI ordered the blueberry/pomegranate martini and it was delicious. My friend loved the Orient Express (a coffee-based martini). The tuna tartare was amazing, and I ordered the special (which was a short rib udon). The food blew our expectations away. Sure, it's a VERY expensive meal, but it's Las Vegas. \n\nI thought they did an excellent job of offering a fusion selection that didn't over-complicate. They stayed true to Asian flavors and I liked that. \n\nThe service was hands down the best we experienced in Las Vegas. The chocolate fortune cookies at the end of the meal gave us fortunes that were hilarious, full of sexual innuendo, and right on point. \n\nI would definitely recommend Tao. Our meal was pretty much flawless, outside of the $5 bowl of jasmine rice (really? five dollars? it was perfect rice, but come on, I can feed a family for a month with $5 worth of rice). More to come when I write up the review of the Lebron party at the Tao Nightclub."

My boyfriend and I failed to get into the nightclub the night we arrived, but he wanted to give their \"Spiritual Dining\" a chance, so we ate dinner here the night before we left.\n\nTao is huge. And I love their asian-themed decor. But it looks like it'd be impossible to get a seat without a reservation. They just get THAT much traffic, and we still had to wait about 10 minutes before getting our reserved table. Our server Darren was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu and specials. There were LOTS to mention. Just like Sushi Roku, we discovered that it's customary (at least in these fine dining places) to have two servers: one to take your order and check-in, and the other to bring you your food and drinks.\n\nIt took us forever to order, but because it took us 5 mins. to figure out we had to close our menu to order. Lesson learned! I started off my appetizers with an Orient Express cocktail ($13) with Kahlua and Vanilla Liqueur.  My bamboo steamed vegetable dumplings (which were green!) and crunchy cucumbers (Japanese style, bitter like ginger) for $10 satisfied my grumbling stomach quite well. \n\nMy main was Buddha's Harmonized Vegetable Feast for the Minor Gods, which was an entree-sized udon in sesame & black peppercorn sauce with red pepper, onions, bok choy, asparagus, and brussel sprouts to top it off ($17). A vegetarian feast indeed. The dish came in a bowl which made it less messy than it probably would have been had it come on a plate, but I wasn't expecting the amount of spice. Still, a great veggie entree (maybe the only veggie entree!).\n\nTip: The restrooms say \"Yin\" and \"Yang.\" Yin is for the women and Yang is for the men. \n\nDarren offered us a menu of \"temptation\" which was the right word for it. I could barely get any more food in my stomach so I wanted ice cream. And I got to choose 3 different scoops: White Chocolate & Yuzu, Cocunut, and Green Tea with almond cookies and even Pocky sticks ($8) - bonus. The thing is, I think the Yuzu (a Japanese fruit much like tangerine) was overpowering the white chocolate, or else they were two separate flavours and they brought me the wrong one. I couldn't finish the scoops anyway, because we also got two chocolate fortune cookies!\n\nThe Vegas magazines say this restaurant is only a $30 meal, but we spent about double that including drinks, appetizers and dessert.\n\nTao Restaurant is truly a religious dining experience as they say. You probably have to be the type to appreciate asian food, the 20-foot buddha fountain, and the ancient pipe display on the wall, but I'm glad I dined here on my trip - it's a restaurant like no other I've seen in any of my travels."

The salmon sashimi was incredibly fresh, melt-in-your mouth. \n\nThe service... 5 stars. The servers I had made excellent suggestions for selections (especially when we came a year ago with a party of ten) and are incredibly gracious and passionate about the food they serve. \n\nThe atmosphere.... definitely 5 stars. Lush red decor, perfect music makes this restaurant simultaneously romantic and seductive. \n\nWhy are you still reading? Go! Go to Tao already!"

            "review": "PARKING:\nFree Parking in Vegas baby! \n\nPLACE:\nAsian theme located in Venetian Hotel at the entrance there is ladies naked and their nipple are covered with petals . Upon entrance if you made a booking through open table no one will greet you because the entrance to the night club is the same so as soon you get there you have to locate the person who's in charge of your dinner reservation and it's pretty dark . It's located on left side in the very dark unorganized corner .  \nThe Buddha is beautiful set in the middle . Plenty of seating available in a Friday night . Loud music is being played since the setting is more lounge bar and the Tao night club is located upstairs not a dinner set up style . \n\nSERVICE: \nThey are pretty fast and the girl who served us pretty nice and quick but so cheers for her! And they do stamp you here to get free entrance in the nightclub if you order any food in their main entree . \n\nFOOD:\n*Pricy for what it is, well it's Vegas so expect it! \n*Size of the service in sushi is pretty good \n*Thai noodle with pork serving good for 2 person   \nOverall not worth it , better check other dining that deliver the best food rather than pretentious gimmicky place  . but if you wanna avoid paying for the ticket in the night club and eat here instead automatically they will give you free stamp ticket for you guys to get into the Tao night club \n\n*the upstairs of Tao Asia bistro is the Tao nightclub\n*if you are guest in the Venetian which we are you can have free entree as well in the club"

Food was wonderful and the lychee martini was right on point. \nAfter dinner, we should get stamped to enter Tao Nightclub.... No one ever came up to us for a stamp. We walked up to the front desk and they directed us to the bouncer in front to get stamped. I came up to him letting him know we just finished dinner and didn't receive our stamp, his response was to get in line. I told him we just stepped out of dinner and were told to come up to him... \"Did you hear what I said, you need to get in line. You are not going to cut all these people. \" I was in shock. How can someone reply that way? Raising his voice at me.. With attitude.... I am not 13 trying to sneak into a club. \nNevertheless, I wasn't about to stand in a line that wrapped around the floor AND deal with his attitude again. Extremely disappointed. An experience like this reunited my view on Tao."

Tables a bit too close for a romantic dinner, but the party/Vegas atmosphere made up for it. Did I mention the Sea Bass was bad ass? Definitely will get it next time again."
