            "review": "I had a much better experience here on my second try. I guess sticking with the meats is the way to go. The happy hour deals of 50% off all steaks really makes it a phenomenal deal of the day. \n\nRib eye steak- 5 stars. Fatty and was cooked perfectly. \nKansas City bone-in - 4 stars. Not as fatty but good flavor. We asked for medium rare, but it was completely rare inside. \n\nBrussel sprouts with honey and swine- 5 stars. Brussels Sprouts were as good as mon ami gabi, plus it has fat bacon or pork belly bits with a tint of lemon. I didn't taste the honey. It was good either way.\n\nTruffle Mac and cheese- 4 stars.  Didn't taste the truffle oil at all, but it was a solid Mac and cheese.\n\nFood was seasoned well. We went on a good day!!!!! Will be back again for happy hour when I have a hankering for steak."

Ordered the Alsatian flatbread topped with red onions, potatoes, goat cheese, and arugula. It was o.k. tasting, nothing to rave about. Had a bite of my sister's Bisteca flatbread. That one tastes better than mine."

First of all, its nothing nice to look at from the outside, but once you get on the inside you definitely get the speakeasy 20's feel. The ambiance is great!\n\nI ordered the moscow mule and the ramos fiz which were both the best I have ever had, and from what I hear you definitely get a show if you sit at the bar and watch them make their drinks. The drink selection is awesome and I cannot wait to try them all.\n\nMy fiance and I shared a caprese salad which tasted great. I really like how sweet and thick the balsamic sauce was. I ordered a filet mignon with a blue cheese crust and the steak was great. We ordered truffle fries and asparagus for our sides and both tasted amazing.\n\nI really cannot wait to go back. It is a great date spot and I could really come here eery night for a post-work drink. I probably wouldnt come to eat unless it was happy hour though because the steaks were expensive, but such a good deal for HH!"

We sat at the bar and all of the bartenders were very personable and knowledgeable in drinks. My dad asked about a high end scotch which was about $135 a shot. yes, a shot. He was just curious but because it was his birthday, the bartender was nice enough to let him try about 3 different types of scotches. The ambiance is very intimate with the dim and red lighting. Can't wait to go back :)"

We had half off everything on the menu.The drinks were cheap during happy hour. We had the calamari, flatbread pizza, gnocchi with Bolognese sauce. They were all tasty. They had other things on the menu but was too full to order any more. I would have to come back here and check out  the food again. Not a bad place."

Everything about it is amazing to me. \n\nThe cocktails are so unique and exquisite. I love their Pimms Cup, Pisco Sour, Diablo, Last Word, oh I could name some more but you should go find out for yourself. The discovery of these classic cocktails is such a marvelous occurrence for your taste-buds. \n\nThe food is wonderful. The BEST and I will keep saying this until some other place tries to beat them out on it, but seriously the BEST Truffle Mac & Cheese I have ever had. It is one of my favorite dishes. I also enjoy their cobb salad and filet. I have had their flatbreads too. So good. \n\nThe bartenders are super talented, especially the owner Nectaly when he gets behind the bar on occasions. Nectaly, Brian, and Michael are the three that really stand out whenever I go. They are friendly, entertaining, and know how to make their drinks. \n\nI have never been bored just sitting there. The atmosphere is dark and mysterious. It makes me feel relaxed and mysterious myself. The music is usually good. The DJ on Saturday nights can be a hit or miss for me, but they do not ruin my mojo when I am there. \n\nWriting this is making me miss it. I think I shall have to get some Mac & Cheese after all my Halloween festivities tonight. \n\nSide note: They close at 2am M-Th, 3am F & S, and completely closed on Sundays. \n\nThank you everyone at Herbs & Rye for being awesome."

The spicy muscles are quite good, just be sure to ask for more bread at the beginning.  We've had both the filet and the strip steak.  Both were excellent and I am a little picky about steaks.  The sweet potato tater tots are a can't miss side item.  Finally, the cookie desert (huge) and the espresso were top-notch.  \n\nDon't let the exterior of the building fool you.   This place is a rock solid choice if you want to go somewhere that doesn't involve the casinos.  And the happy hour 50% off specials are unbeatable."

            "review": "I was here with my sister and her pharmacy school friends a couple nights ago and was overall quite pleased with my experience. We originally made a reservation for 10 but we must have miscounted because we actually had 12 people in our party. What should've been an easy fix (adding a couple chairs and place settings) took about fifteen minutes and my sister overheard the waiters whispering to each other about making us wait longer since we inconvenienced them. Very uncool. \n\nThe first thing I noticed when I walked in was that it was very VERY dim. It took a while for my eyes to adjust, but I guess it added to the ambiance. The service was a little slow but the food was quite good. Since we had a party of more than 8, we were told to order appetizers and share them family style which would cost each of us $8. We agreed to it and were not disappointed. We got margherita flatbread, meatballs, calamari, and caprese salad. For my entree I ordered a flat iron and it was cooked perfectly and tasted great. I ordered truffle fries for my side and the portion was huge. So even though the steak was a little pricey, I feel like I pretty much paid for two. We made happy hour thanks to our waiter who disclosed to us that we should order our entrees quickly before it ended. This meant that all of the steak entrees were half off which is a pretty great deal. At the very end, our waiter brought out free desserts for us which brings them up to four stars despite the questionable service at the beginning."

It's been awhile since I have had any food from there, but from I remember the happy hours were legit, good deals. As for my last visit, they have been slowly turning this place into a really nice whiskey bar. Although yes the whiskey drinks are expensive! You could easily get a beer for $5. Had a few different drinks Moscow Mule, Airport, something Sang... Real good! This would also be a good spot to take a lady on a nice intimate date."

            "review": "Ambience is nice, pretty dark inside and has an old school feel to it. I was carded immediately to make sure I was over 21.  I came here for happy hour, in which I lrearned that only certain items on the menu are half price. 2 appetizers, the steaks, well drinks $5, and select beers (blue moon or a red amber) $3. Cocktails are regular price. I sat there for a while waiting for the rest of the party to get there, in the meantime I had a beer and water. After we ordered it took forever for our bread to come out, albeit it was very good, but why couldn't the server brought it out earlier? \nI ordered the ribeye and so did the rest of the group, we compared steaks as we all had pretty fatty and grisly steaks and couldn't tell what we were cutting into as it was so dark. For the price they were charging, I expected a better quality meat. However, the steaks were cooked properly. \n\nService was fantastic, there was no smoking, and no casino noise. However, I am going to try the filet mignon next $17 for happy hour)."

I'm giving this place 4 stars only because every time I go I feel I have to ask for the bread basket multiple times, after awhile it just gets annoying and when it's finally brought out you just don't want it, same goes for when asking for steak sauce or chimichurri.

A few damn good memories of this place too:\n - First time i had anything from the FuKu truck they were parked outside of H&R\n - Going away shindig ended at H&R\n - Did a few birthdays at H&R\n - Coming back shindig started where we left off at H&R\n\nSo it's been another year...Whats new?\n\nHappy hour is still there and all steaks are still half off during happy hour. Well all beef steaks, sorry pork chops and figs guess i'll never discover how you'll taste...\n\nNew draft beer selection. Wow i thought the house Amber was good the new draft selection goes hipster with their selection of micro brews and crap i've never even heard of. I've just discovered i actually do enjoy stout beers now. Funny how one thing can change your opinion of the entire category. \n\nNew super large rib eye steak selection/challenges. \n\n14oz NY Strip on the menu now (personal favorite) \n\nSo umm...yeah"

Flat breads, garlic mashed potatoes, and calamari are so delicious. Perfectly seasoned and cooked to order steaks. Top notch, A++ restaurant! Moscow mule is a flavorful drink that is a must try. Perfect for a go to date night place. It is sure to impress! Staff and service is top notch! Only bad thing I could see was the bathroom. Door opens to the backside of the bar to show someone standing there peeing. That situation needs some work."

We made a reservation for 7 but got hungry early and they seated us right away as they did the 1st visit.  I love the interior of this place.  It is decorated very classy, dim lighting, upbeat music that I would think of for swing dancing.  Even the bathroom was decorated nice and very clean.  Our waiter, Jaquim was on point!  He was perfect. pleasant, attentive and knowledgeable.  Tonight I had the crab cake which is OMG! the best.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to never like anyone else's after eating theirs.   I had the seared Salmon and again, PERFECT.  Whoever the chef is and whoever decided the menu for this place knows what they are doing.  Then there are the drinks...The 1st visit and this visit we have tried several different specialties that they offer.  I have only positives things to say about this place and highly recommend it!"

First 3-4 times I came here was perfectly happy... but then the patron to my right ordered food, life had changed. Steak happy hour I discover is between 4-8 and 12-4am you will be more then satisfied 50% off steaks that you would be happy to pay 200% for. Between the steaks, the calamari, the chorizo meatballs... this place is a gem! Doesn't look much from the outside but crack the door have a seat enjoy a \"everybody knows my name\" top knotch experience. Granted even with the happy hour steaks a 2 hour visit normally rings in about $130 with all the drinks you won't be able to resist, I pay it with a smile and shake the bartenders hand with a gracious tip of the hat. Favorite place for dinner in Vegas hands down. *Pro Tip* Rebel Republic is right across the street one of the best craft beer spots in LV pay them a visit first to wet the whistle, great beers friendly staff, tell Wendy I sent ya ;)."

It has a very dark, sexy, low-lit lighting that kind of resembles an old-jazz-club or speakeasy! I love that they're never overbooked or that you don't have to wait to get seated. \n\nTheir menu has shorten to about two pages. We were looking forward to their lamb chops Jane K. wrote about, but they no longer serve them :( we asked our server about the menu changes/ shortening and his answer was due to change of chiefs. \n\nAnyways on to our meal, we came just in time for happy hour, and because of their menu changes, it was even more limited to choose from for happy hour... for appetizer, we shared calamari (which is not consider a happy hour item). I ordered an 8oz. flat iron steak, and a side of truffle mac & cheese. and he ordered 12oz. steak with a side of jalape\u00f1o creamed corn. \n-my medium flat iron steak was juicy with just the right amount of red and seasoning. i don't like my steak tooo bloody red that when you slice a piece of steak with your knife it oozes out with blood. Herbs and Rye didn't give me that problem, thank you! \n-truffle mac & cheese. tasted exactly as how it sounds, and it was delicious!\n- jalape\u00f1o creamed corn, was too hot at first, so be sure to let it cool down before taking your first bite! I was expecting to taste what I've tried at the Studio B Buffet in M Casino, but it tasted nothing like that. the jalape\u00f1o added its distinct flavor. If you're not into \"spicy\" food I would definitely suggest you get a different side because after a couple of bites, I had to stop being it was getting too spicy and I love spicy food! especially if I'm the type of person to have sriracha on everything! hahaha \n-calamari in my bf's words \"best in the whole wide world\" the breading was just right and not thick, it was drizzled with a sauce that had its own zesty taste that you wouldn't have to squeeze a lemon like other places that serve calamari. what makes Herbs and Rye calamari \"best in the world\" is the thinly slice cooked proscitto that adds the \"crunch\" to every bite. mmm DELICIOUS! it was soo good we ordered calamari to go so that our family would try how delicious it was! \n\nHerbs and Rye is definitely a place I would recommend to bring friends  & family from out of town and even a perfect place to bring a date! :)"

Very dark and mysterious with a hint of The Great Gatsby. It's not a big restaurant so the service was impeccable. The second the appetizer was finished entrees were delivered. The drinks were beyond imagination of mixology. \n\nFood:\nWe had ordered the calamari appetizer with prosciutto, banana peppers and a creamy spicy aioli. Probably one of the best calamari I have had in a long time. \nMy boyfriend ordered the steak with their garlic mashed potatoes and I ordered the spicy clam and linguini. I think that the pasta was just tossed with the clam juice and white wine with pepper flakes which was just delicious. We ordered a side of truffle fries too that was just adorable. \nI couldn't leave without desert and ordered their cookie and ice cream which was an cookie cooked on a skillet with 3 scoop of ice cream. Think pazookie. \n\nEverything was great and definitely was blown away at the service and the food quality! 5 dang starssss!!!"

Our server was attentive and recommended just about everything on the menu as his favorite (thanks for the \"help\" deciding right!) We spent $130 including tip, our usual spot is at least $200 before tip so my husband was really happy. Most of what we ordered was half off since it was happy hour, score! \n\nI ordered the punisher for a cocktail which was amazing, not too much alcohol taste just the way I prefer. My husband the zombie which he enjoyed but was too strong for me. For our appetizer we got the clams which came with a baguette. I really loved this dish! I did manage to get clam juice all over my dress and was brought club soda which was really nice! My husband ordered the prime rib with a side of button mushrooms and I the New York strip with the house rub and my side of garlic mashed potatoes (I really wish they had a creamed spinach or vegetable medley). My husbands steak was perfection, mushrooms delicious! My steak came with a light chili drizzle! Now, I'm not one for anything too spicy so my first though was oh shit... what did I just order?! It was amazing! Not too spicy at all! I'd highly recommend the house rub! I didn't find the mashed potatoes too garlic flavored which usually is a deal breaker for me but I was too excited about the amazing steak to care. \n\nWe really loved this place and certainly will be back!"

Otherwise, it was seared just about right and had perfect pepper and salt seasoning. Great taste. \n\nProbably the most notable part of this dining experience was that the steak was half off. That's right - half off during Happy Hour - 5-8pm. So I enjoyed a nice $36 NY cut for $18. That might've been the best $18 NY cut I've ever had. \n\nI enjoyed this dining experience. If the NY was a little leaner I would've given 5/5. But 4/5 is good. I'll definitely return to try the other Meat Methods"

Yes its that old, but the history behind the place and the aura it projects is a must tell and classic. \n\nUnfortunately I only visited to enjoy and check out the raved about cocktails.  We enjoyed a few different cocktails and all were unique in its own way. I was a little skeptical because I am a vodka drinker and only 2 or 3 of the cocktails had vodka. The majority of the drinks contain gin. So I asked what they recommend and went for it.\n\nCocktails:\nRamos Gin Fizz- Now this is a creamy creation. They warn you it will take awhile because there are 3 steps to making this drink all which require patience and time. I was really interested because one of the ingredients is egg white. Never seen or heard that being used. The drink was delicious, creamy, not too sweet and you couldn't even taste the alcohol. Definitely recommend this one!\n\nBlood & Sand- honestly I only ordered it to see the presentation. They spark a mini fire blaze with the orane peel at the end. Get your video out! The drink was a bit strong and the scotch is pretty prominent, served like a martini. \n\nCorpse Reviver No.2 - only thing I can remember is how much you could taste the absinthe\n\nVesper - it was one of the only ones with vodka. Served like a martini and definitely has that strong taste of alcohol.I guess with Gin & Vodka how could it not. \n\nWe sat at the bar and it was pretty busy so as far as service it was above average. The bartender was super busy the entire time, I wouldn't say he was the nicest guy but he made amazing cocktails. \n\nI definitely want to go back and try the food.

It was an amazing energy.\n\nSpicy Mussels ($26; H/H $13): This was recommended by our bartender and I was actually hesitant! You know what happened next - I am so incredibly glad we ordered it because it is truly fantastic! Seriously, WOW. The mussels are served in a tomato stew made with white wine and it is absolutely perfect. We literally wiped the bowl clean with bread. There was no way we were leaving a drop because it's that good. And that happy hour price is KILLER!\n\nMediterranean Flatbread ($16): Pesto, goat cheese, artichoke, roasted tomato, and olives. Whoa. This is another home run. I remembered enjoying the flatbreads in the past, but not as much as now. The crust was so, so good - crusty perfection and ridiculous flavor. The toppings definitely sealed the deal.\n\nUSDA Certified Angus Ribeye, 18 oz ($59; H/H $29.50): I'm certain this is a big part of their popularity - 50% off steaks during happy hour. Yeah, it's a great deal. This is my third time with their steaks and I don't know what's up, but I don't enjoy them. This time, the temperature was perfect (I ordered rare plus), but there was a thick charcoal crust on the steak. We wrote it off as the way their steaks are prepared, so we took off what we could and enjoyed it as much as possible. Then, I saw photos of their steaks and realized that there is usually no crust. I should've said something, but I also wonder why they would serve it like that? Either way, I'm avoiding their steaks or I'm going to figure out a way to get that perfectly-cooked steak from them!\n\nI love their choice of sides! They're all delicious.\nBrussels Sprouts and Honey Swine ($8.50)\nTruffle Crispy Fries ($8.50)\nSweet Potato Tots ($8.50)\n\nDoughnuts with Caramel and White Chocolate ($8.50): Fresh delicious, fluffy doughnuts. Really great. The white chocolate sauce is amazing. I could eat like 50 more.\n\nTheir cocktails are insane. I got Blood and Sand (Scotch, Cherry Herring, Sweet Vermouth, and orange juice) because that's my jam. I'm not a straight up scotch drinker, but I love a good scotch cocktail. Their interpretation of Blood and Sand is AMAZING and obviously, you get a show with it."

This isn't your typical bar where you're going to get a Redbull vodka (in fact a friend of mine tried to order it and the bar refused to serve it). Their drinks are inspire by the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, so on and so forth. They're make you amazing custom drinks with fresh ingredients as well if you ask.\n\n2. The food on the other hand is okay.

Much to our delight we found another locals spot that we will be sure to frequent.   However, take note that you do not come here for the service.  The waistaff was nice enough but didn't seem to have their at together.\n\nNow on to the fun stuff...\nMussels in tomato sauce was awesome.  Enjoy the fresh hot bread and soak up every drop of the sauce.\nThe carpaccio was great although a little less of the mayo type sauce would have made it perfect!! \nDinner consisted of the family style portion of the linguine and clams.  Great flavor and good sized portion.  It would be great to automatically bring up the proper bowls And utensils to we could enjoy dinner.\nWe were too full for dessert.\n\nAnother cool feature are the cocktails.  They have quite the throwback list and crush their ice in a bag, old fashioned style.  \n\n\nDefinitely a spot to try if you're looking for a new place to eat and drink!!!\n\n\n***  ADDITION TO THE REVIEW  ***\nWe went back for another dinner.  Appetizers were the same as above but we made different dinner selections.  The notable selection was the Ribeye with Green Chimichurri sauce.  DELICIOUS.\n\nHowever, the one that WINS it all are the homemade donuts to order.  A total MUST!!  They are miniature donuts with powered sugar.  Absolutely finger licking good.   Not a good take home item for later though.  Once they were cold they weren't so yummy...  so enjoy hot and eat them all!"

We ordered the porterhouse, carpaccio, beef tartar, sweet potato tater tots, and steamed mussels. Seems like a little but the portions are filling. Steak wasn't that great but the tartar was outstanding and the mussel broth was the perfect amount of spicy. Their menu is extensive with four pages of cocktails but with each one we ordered they got progressively worse. We had a Moscow Mule, Incredible Hulk, Ward Eight, and a regular vodka cranberry. I've heard that their bartenders are some of the best in Las Vegas but I was disappointed. I'll definitely come back though. Loved the atmosphere and the late hours. The exterior looks run down but inside reminds me of prohibition with dim lighting and old fashioned decor.  Also they have a happy hour past 12, steaks half off!"

I really had nothing to say the first time around (just my friend and I) except that it took forever and a day to get our check.\n\nThe majority of the review here will be for the second experience (tonight). It was a fairly large group -- a group of 12 for a birthday dinner.\n\nWhen making the reservation for the large party, they tell you you need to order appetizers to start off. However, they didn't enforce this when we were there, FYI.\n\nMost of us ordered steaks because of happy hour half off. I personally got the flat iron (medium rare and $14 due to HH) with a side of asparagus (comes with a side).\n\nI enjoyed my food. No complaints at all there. However, as a party, service wasn't as expected. We asked for splits check when we were ordering -- she said okay. Well, that was easy, for such a large group.\n\nWhen the food finally came out (mind you, it was really long since there were so many of us), one of us didn't get his steak. Apparently they made a mistake and made it well done instead of medium rare (though, when it did finally come out, it was medium). That issue was resolved in the end as he got his steak comped.\n\nShe forgot about splitting checks only to come back 10 minutes later to tell us we can't do split checks and we just simply have to tell her how much to charge on each credit card. Bah. That was a good pain in the butt because somehow we were short $10 and it was just such a huge headache. They did give us a small treat at the end (not sure what kind of donuts they were? beignets?) for the birthday boy.\n\nManager was nice and easy to work with but I guess just the system of doing things was not a pleasant experience. The food was a much better experience for me this time around. So, try their steaks! Maybe not at full price, but happy hour -- why not?"

We were seated pretty promptly, and our (very friendly) server greeted us and took our drink orders for the bar right away. And then.....nothing. It took them 30 minutes to get us our cocktails. \"There is a large party in the bar\" we were told. Okay. Not a good excuse, but fine. Whatever. Our server finally brought us our drinks and told us that he comped them due to how long we had to wait. Fine. But there is a problem when you get your appetizers and your salads, and finish eating them, before your drinks come. \nAnd then we waited. And waited. And waited. By 8:45 we still didn't have our food, which consisted of an order of 2 steaks, some broccoli, and truffle mac and cheese. Please remember we got there at 7:15! When we finally did get it, somewhere around 9 pm, the food was good, and of course our poor Embarrassed Server was very apologetic.  I felt so sorry for him. However, there is no excuse for it taking almost 2 hours to cook a couple of steaks. At a steakhouse. They should be much more efficient and proficient at steak-cooking! My husband and I were joking that they must be importing the beef....from Brazil. But by now we both had two ( very well made, despite the loooooooong wait) craft cocktails in us, so we were pretty sauced, considering we had been drinking on almost empty stomachs. \nThere was a couple sitting across from us who came in after us, and they were (judging by the angry and annoyed looks on their faces) suffering the same wait...and fate....as we were. So obviously this wasn't an anomaly. After we finally finished, Embarrased Server jokingly asked us if we wanted dessert. We told him no thank you, we both have to work on Monday,  just the check please.\n We tipped him 20% (poor guy probably though he was going to get stiffed. But it wasn't his fault) and we FINALLY left. It was 9:30. \nSo, my advice to the Powers That Be at this establishment: Stop trying to save your bottom line by grossly  understaffing your (very busy) establishment. You are extremely lucky to have a restaurant that is this popular and busy in a city that is full of great restaurants. People have many other options in this town.  There is no excuse for having only 2 bartenders in such a busy bar. There is no excuse for your kitchen being so ridiculously slow and backed up.There is no excuse for it taking 2 and a half hours to turn over a two-top. I am sure your servers pay the price for this policy in their bottom lines, as they are usually the ones who get \"stiffed\" when service is too slow or the food (that your customers wait 2 hours for)isn't up to par. Not every ignored  customer is as nice and understanding as my husband and I are. I am pretty sure that your 50% Happy Hour policy, (which don't get me wrong, is fabulous) is the lure you need in order to keep people coming back. Because the service and promptness  certainly are not. \nI am giving this restaurant 3 stars. The only reason is due to the courtesy and obvious concern from our poor Embarrassed Server, and the fact that when we FINALLY did get our food, it was good. But not good enough to go through this a second time."

So far I haven't had a bad cocktail yet, but I'm mostly a vodka or wine girl. The happy hour red is not too shabby. I wish there were more choices, but considering the awesome HH food choices, I think we can agree to let that one go. \n\nOur friends told us about the happy hour until 8pm and we were shocked that it includes half off steaks! What a great deal. We started with the mussels appetizer. I loved the sauce. Mussels tasted great, but that red sauce had a real nice kick to it. Quite a few of the mussels would not open, but the waiter had no issue bringing us another batch. For dinner, I ordered the Bone - in Kansas city. It was very flavorful and tender. I'm seriously laying in bed still thinking about it. \nWe also ordered the garlic smashed, garlic spinach, and sweet potato tots. Best way I've ever had sweet potato.  The spinach and smashed came out with a piece of garlic clove on top. Nice touch. I liked all of our sides, but the favorite at the table was the truffle Mac n cheese. \n\nRonnie was an excellent server. Very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. If you have any questions on the menu, ask him! I'm not one for adding anything to an already amazing steak, but my friend really loved the chimichurri add on. My other friend cautioned that the ribeye was quite fatty, but the bf ordered it and was very happy. It was huge! They also ordered the homemade doughnuts and ice cream cookie. I can't comment on taste, because I was good and abstained, but it smelled delicious. Either would have easily been enough for the whole table! \n\nI will def be back, I just don't know if I'll be able to try any of the other steak choices, as I'm still dreaming of the Kansas. Yum!"

I would have made love to.them if my date didn't wolf them down so fast!  Savory and delicious, the goat cheese was perfect with them.  Ordered steaks of course.  The add on options are great but my Bone In KC was not a great cut.  Much to fatty.  On the other hand, my date got the filet and it would melt in your mouth.  Don't ever get the whipped garlic mash.  Awful.  Just tasted like cheap instant, disappointing.  \n\nDrinks?  Oh mama!  Great cocktail menu.  Be brave and branch out or just order a Moscow mule (my favorite).  Bartenders here are obviously pros so be patient, these aren't gin and tonics.\n\nFinally, service was great.  Sever was knowledgeable, helpful and attentive.  We came at a busy time but he still made us feel welcome.  Love this joint."

Drinks are great! \n\nThe vibe and the aesthetics remind me of Capo's! Except Capo's is cleaner (women's bathroom had a bad odor). Also Capo's has better tasting quality food!\n\nThe reason why I gave this place three stars is because the food definitely is overpriced. We ordered the spicy mussels, the sauce was tasty and so was the French bread to dip it with, but the mussels tasted freezer burnt....awful! Beef carpaccio was extra salty even without eating the capers...yikes! The penne pasta - over cooked prosciutto and over powering garlic sauce....eeeek! Jalape\u00f1o cream corn was ok - the best out of all the dishes but still lacking flavor. We did end the night with the half order of donuts....yum! It was well worth the calories! Overall I would come back for drinks and service definitely grabbing a bite somewhere else before heading there!!!"

The quality of the ingredients and the preparation make this a place worth eating.\n\nYou should come for the cocktails. If you like a good cocktail this is easily one of the best places in Vegas. They carry spirits and cordials that most bartenders haven't heard of. The preparation is generally spot on.\n\nThey have some stupid rules about splitting checks with large parties. That is enough to keep me from eating there in a large group ever again."

It's a prohibition gangster style bar and steakhouse. \n\nThe cocktails are $10 each which is not bad for Vegas prices.  They also have a beer that they make. I believe it's an IPA. That was hoppily delightful. \n\nAlthough I did not eat there the food looked and smelled great. Although that was closer to Vegas prices but I think still a little cheaper. \n\nYou won't find cran and vodka here. Not even a manhattan. Think rye, absinthe, and bourbon based drinks. The bartenders are very friendly and can recommend something if you are unsure about the ingredients (a few drinks have egg white for \"froth and a creamy texture\")\n\nI have been to Vegas several times and I will definitely be coming back here on my next trip. \n\nAlso happy hour (or hours) are 5p-8p and midnight-3a."

I tried a bit of the Boulevardier and Remember the Maine and there were also very well made.\n\nI read that bartenders who work on The Strip like to come here for classic well-executed cocktails. I can see why. During our visit, there were also people who were first time visitors there like us.\n\nI'd said that Herbs & Rye is a place where you definitely go for the cocktails, and you can stay for food if you want though not a must. They do have a good happy hour (5-8pm, 12am-2am) with 50% off some items and ALL the steaks. However, the food was not mind blowing. It was good but not outstanding.\n\nAnother off-strip place worth visiting for well done cocktails."

My group had 11 cocktails  and 9 were just slightly off making the drink a little harsh to swallow.  We are cocktail  people and travel to places like tails of the cocktail  in new orleans for cocktails and this was the worst sazerac I've ever had.  My group of 4 agreed that the drinks were  not up to our expectations of a Herbs and Rye cocktail.  \nSecondly, the steaks were filled with fat and 1 with way too much gristle. We had amazing steaks in our past visits  to Herbs and Rye and this visits quality was very disappointing for our whole group. I known that ribeyes are marbled with fat but this was excessive.   Don't believe gristle about the size of a tennis ball should be found in the middle of a New York steak.\nThird, we all were so disappointed to walk in and hear Michael Jackson,  stevie wonder and other 70's soul\nR & B being played.  We are use to the electro swing, jazzy lounge style of music they played all other times we have been there. Herbs & Rye has a great lounge feel / atmosphere. Playing the wrong style of music for its decor didn't make sense and to not hear the great lounge swing style of music was disappointing.\nIt altered the feel of this great restaurant and bar.\n\nAfter about $300, we had to sadly leave.  We ended up finishing the night at a different cocktail bar. We were very disappointed and discussed  our sadness over cocktails later that night and over breakfast the next day.  I sure hope management won't ruin this amazing place.  We recommend  it to everyone that will listen and after last night, I'm afraid to recommend it.\nLast night was 3/5 @ best\nAll past visits 5/5.   \nWILL BE BACK AGAIN BUT hoping our favorite bar just had a bad night.  The music COMPLETELY changed the vibe of this lounge for the worse!!!!!!!!"

            "review": "For me the atmosphere was better than the meal.  From the outside, it looks like your standard neighborhood bar, but on the inside, you'll think you stepped into a trendy new hotspot at the Wynn or the Bellagio.  Dim lighting, attractive servers, and groovy music all come together nicely.  I especially like the old movies playing on the flat-screens above the bar.\n\nAbout the food:  Appetizer was great.  Entree was not so great.  I ordered these marinated meatballs as a starter that had wonderful flavor.  I should have made a meal out of them, but opted for the filet mignon with a mac & cheese side.  Be careful how you order it because medium well somehow got translated into well-done.  So my steak arrived as a flavorless, dried-out piece of beef jerky.  And the mac & cheese was a little too bland for my taste.  To be fair though, my buddy ordered the same steak medium RARE and his looked (and tasted) much better.  I also preferred his mushroom side to my mac & cheese.  Those were the best marinated shrooms I've ever eaten.  So altogether, I'd say the food can be hit or miss.\n\nAbout the price.  I thought for a \"$$\" designation, I would be under $30 (Yardhouse pricing), but after an appetizer, entree with a side, and a decent tip (20%), I was into this meal for $75.  I wasn't on a date; I was just grabbing a late-night dinner with a friend. So this was a bit more than I wanted to pay.\n\nWould I go here again? Sure, but maybe during happy hour when the menu is a little cheaper."

Their happy hour menu is not limited to steaks but also sides and by the glass wines. Being a popular spot, if you go with a big group expect a wait. Midnight hits and this place is packed. Who would of thought so many carnivores craved meats this late. I ordered my favorite cut, Ribeye medium rare closer to rare. I like it juicer than most. It was cooked a little more medium but still very tasty. I also ordered two sides: asparagus and their truffle mashed potatoes. The asparagus were perfect, steamed with still a bite to it. The truffle oil mash was a little too buttery for my taste. It was very wet and mushy. Overall, this place is great for late night eats. For a fine dining establishment. I really hope their food is better during normal hours."

I normally don't care for lemon drinks but this one was delicious and not overpowering. \n\nFor food, we shared the caprese salad and the pork & figs. The salad was stacked with delicious mozzarella, thick tomatoes and the biggest basil leaves I have ever seen!  The pork chop is topped with melted blue cheese and lays on a bed of mashed potatoes paired with balsamic figs. We almost wish we didn't share this dish!  So yummy and perfectly balanced!  Our meal was finished off with their decadent homemade donuts. They are pretty sugary...but very delicious!!\n\nWe will definitely be back to sit at the bar, partake in the hand crafted cocktails and half-priced happy hour steaks!!"

I was told to definitely go for the happy hour - and everybody was right (half-off all well drinks, almost all steaks and some seafood). With that said, try one of their craft cocktails; there are easily 50 to choose from. For the quality and flavor, $11 is a steal. \n\nMy dinner partner liked the spicy mussels we ordered as an appetizer, but I found them to be a bit heavy handed on the oregano. \n\nWe ordered the NY strip and a filet mignon, asparagus, Mac and cheese, garlic mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts with honey swine - and not a bite disappointed. Absolutely stellar food. The chef even came around and asked several tables if everything was to their liking. Very personable, and a nice touch. \n\nMy only complaint was the service. Our server was sometimes hard to find, and incredibly slow bringing drinks. They were busy, but given the relatively small size of the venue, there's no way it took the bartender 15 minutes to pour two glasses of wine. We ordered as soon as we were served dinner (would have ordered before, but the waiter was nowhere to be seen) and had to stop eating halfway through so we could have some food left to enjoy with the wine. \n\nI will definitely be back (can't beat $128 for phenomenal steaks, sides, 4 drinks and an appetizer), with fingers crossed for a better server."

All I know is that it was a very long day, I was starving, and anything that was food would have hit the spot.  In other words, I didn't expect much coming in. Maybe a good thing that I didn't expect much because I was actually surprised by the menu.  I expected nothing but fried dishes or meals with zero sustenance. What I found was a menu ranging from apps to steaks.  Prices are not pub prices though.  Price here is what you are to expect at a steakhouse.  A ton of really tempting items on this menu like Filet Mignon and Lobster, Burgers, and other steak options.  \n\nWith all the recent talk about White Castle here in Vegas for the last couple of days (compliments of the Foodie Fest), I decided on their sliders.  The presentation of these sliders is probably the best I've seen in awhile.  It at least kicks White Castle's butt.  I thought that the sliders were pretty good, but just a little rich.  We also got their fully loaded calamari.  To me, I thought it was one big workout killing mess.  It had a ton of what appears to be mayo, bacon, and some other add ons.  Both Terri and I, scraped off this mess and ate some calamari the way it should be eaten.  \n\nAs for the ambiance, you can say that you get two types.  When you walk in, you have the bar to the right where all the action is.  It's louder, brighter, and this is where everyone else is eating.  Then you got the quiet side where it's dimmer, quiet, and barely where anyone is dining.  Normally, I'm good with either side. But on this night, the dining was a little too tight on the bar side. So, we ate where it was quieter and darker.  Since it was also late, keeping ourselves from falling asleep was a challenge in itself.  My other concern is that we would be forgotten and our orders never taken.  This wasn't an issue at Herbs & Rye.  Regardless which side you choose to eat, service seems to be right on. \n\nOverall, Herbs & Rye is a decent place to meet with friends, grab a drink, and some dinner.  I'm not a huge fan of pubs in general, but I still have my favorites.  Herbs and Rye can easily be one of them.  \n\nPS:  I don't drink, but there's a some great Happy Hour specials here.  For all you HH dudes and gals, give this place a try. \n\n\nSliders:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hsoYlp9buT_qd3CKSPNLcg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nCalamari (Fully Loaded):  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=oTvwbAcO-gfxqfjK8Vot7g&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nBread:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wZ9FjsP6w30y6bUVLvBrtA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nYou Know It!:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ll-CTLfvRCBFiNe7aWxfrA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ"

We were a party of 5 and had reservations, but we didn't get a table till around 7pm. Service was nothing special than any other restaurant. The place was packed and still had a long line waiting to sit down. Food took a very long time, close to 45+ mins.\n\nCouple of complaints, first being the parking lot: very limited and very hard to find a place during happy hour especially (5pm-8pm). I had to park at the gas station next door. The second thing that really bugged me was the automatic gratuity that's calculated at the full price of the meals. We had to pay a $50 tip on a $150 bill so the total came out to $200. That's about a 34% gratuity. A suggested tip is fine but I'm not a fan of mandatory gratuity payment especially if and when the service is bad.\n\nThe interior looks old school with dimmed lights and have a nice atmosphere, and again the food was amazing!"

LOVE IT!!  bartender was a total cutie old school kinda guy..made some amazing cocktails too!! must try the Pims Cup Cucumber Mint drink! GULP!!!  sides were extra. total for two with one drink each.. including tip $85...  worth that and more due to flavor explosion!! also medium rare was cooked perfect!!  we got there right at 5pm. it was not very busy but full and food wasnt fast but perfectly timed!!!  the outside looks like a crappy night club.. lol.. dont let that fool you.. we will return on our next vegas trip for sure!!!!  one thing im confused on is our waiter said they didnt have any happy hour drink specials..?? WTF?  we ate in the bar in a nice comfy booth!  the music is quite loud which i would have loved if they werent playing the pop Beyonce hip hop .. didnt fit the scene or the customers.."

I mean we orderd our dirty martinis the second we sat down and didn't get them till right when dinner was served (30 min later) I understand they are handmade craft drinks but 30 min, really? Our server was wonderful ( a brunette girl) the busser boys all had attitudes, I feel like the employees don't work as a team. Bartender was awesome to (bearded guy with glasses) the people in the place were super trashy and loud. I had a lady next to me talking about sex and penis the whole dinner, it was repulsive. The salads sucks and the steaks were really good. Over all when you walk in the place it looks cool because it's really dark but I guarantee when the lights come on it looks like a shit hole.

If it's good enough for the chefs, it's good enough for me!\n\nTheir extensive cocktail menu is phenomenal with drinks from every era dating back from 1776. The pours are stiff and the best player in the restaurant scene, bar none. \n\nMary Pickford -- A powerhouse combination of rum, pineapple, Grenadine and Maraschino served in a wide bowl champagne glass. Aside from the drink being fruitastic, it is so strong it'll put hair on your chest. I wasn't able to finish the drink as I wanted to be able to remember my impending meal. Not sure which cocktail I'll order on my next visit but I'm sure it will not disappoint.\n\nSpicy Mussels -- Mussels cooked in a rich, tomato stew with white wine. Not one did not disappoint. Each and every one were plump and juicy. Make sure you dip them in the flavorful stew as it adds that spiciness. This item is listed under their appetizers but they give you so much, I was more than satisfied eating this as my entree. \n\nTheir Happy Hour is undeniably one of the best in the game. Who else has filet mignon and ribeye on their HH menu? The restaurant is not too far from The Strip and is one of the few places I recommend you go out of your way for."

My name is Skacey, I carry twenty years of memories about the town the mob built.\n\nThis investigation starts at Kahunaville inside the TI. I ask the bottle slinger behind the bar about classic cocktails. My never ending quest for the perfect Sezarac leads the conversation to Herbs & Rye. According to his story, H&R is the place to find it.\n\n8:23 pm. My partner and I are on east Sahara when we spot what appears to be a classic Vegas dive bar. Industrial plain building leads me to believe the trail may dead end here. Stepping through the door and we are greeted by a remarkably warm and inviting interior. We decide to sit at the bar to get the full experience.\n\nNow I've spent more than my fair share in Vegas bars and eateries. I remember the Vegas of the 80's as the last whimpers of organized crime faded behind corporate greed. Herbs and Rye brings a classic, personal touch to service. Our bartender is a consummate professional with enough personal interaction to make you feel more than welcome. I would trade ten modern servers for one who studies the art of service like this gentleman.\n\nThe true test comes when I tentatively ask for a Sezarac, fully expecting to have to explain what it is and what's in it. Without missing a beat, the bartender asks about my preference on Rye Whiskey. I just about giggled with delight (yep, glance back at that profile picture and visualize giggling - quite a shocker, huh?)\n\nThe drink is exquisite.\n\nFor the food, I tried their Seafood Diablo and found it to also be inspired. Not to short the details on the food, but remember, I giggled through much of my meal.\n\nThe Good: Best Classic Cocktails, and Classic Service in Las Vegas\nThe Bad: Why does it have to be so far from my home town, Orlando, FL?\nThe Ugly: The outside of the building - really let it go, once you're inside, you'll forget all about it."

While it was 100 degrees and sunny outside, the restaurant was incredibly dark and had a very old-fashioned Las Vegas saloon vibe. \n\nThe menu was quite expansive with the majority of it consisting of drinks. They offer authentic classic cocktails that are worth the trip to the restaurant alone. These bad boys set you back $10 each, but they are worth it. I had the Remember the Main (it was a strong drink since it had Absinthe in it) and a Lion's Tail. These drinks were absolutely delectable and I just wish they were included in the happy hour. I'd be visiting this bar much more often then!\n\nThe bf and I split the special that night, a 24 oz porterhouse steak with one side (we picked button mushrooms) for $29. At that price, it was a no brainer. This steak was arguable one of the best steaks I've ever had. It had a gorgeous charred sear on the outside but was deliciously moist and flavorful on the inside. They have options to add on blue cheese or a dry spice rub, but we wanted to enjoy the steak in all it's natural glory. It was absolutely delicious. Both sides we had, button mushrooms and the garlic mash, were great and completed the meal.\n\nFor dessert, we split their homemade donuts. I'm not much of a dessert person, but these were incredible. You get both the soft and fluffy donuts and donut holes along with a dark chocolate and white chocolate dipping sauce. These were soooo good. \n\nBoth their food and drinks were exceptional and I will definitely be back. Date night seal of approval!"

We had to call the waiter over 3 times to get water to our table and final after 45 mins if waiting I ask if our food was coming. We were told that it was coming right out. I called the waiter again and then he said that the order did not make the kitchen since their ticket machine in the back was not working. However other people that arrived after us did receive their food on time and faster than us.  We final received our meal and the dishes came out separate.  My pork chop was not hot and I just are it as everyone else had received their food and we were ready to leave.  The waiter asked if we needed anything else and said he was sorry about the wait. I was pleased that he apologized but said that he would have to ask the manager if they could discount the meal since we waited so long. When the bill came they took off 2 drink for a table of 3 and did not discount the food????  Thanks for the $8 discount on a $80 ticket. Could do more...especially for locals that brings u business.  \n\nI will have to consider going back again.  Sad because it is a cool place to go that true Vegas"

Landing at 1am it just so happened to be Happy Hour :D\n\nThis place bring back a lot of good o' memories as we use to come here when it was Venetian, an old Italian joint way before Sauteed Clams was established.  It was our alternative to steak and eggs graveyard special for cheap eats back in HS.  I still remember the inconsistent creamy fettuccine alfredo they served with house salad, a soda of your choice, and unlimited bread and butter for $3.99.  It was what I think was our best kept secret as everyone else was still into that S&E phase.\n\nFast forward 10 years later, I'm not being stingy this time.  Oh no, I'm telling everyone and their mama about this place!  This has to be one of the best HH place I've been to in a long, long time.  Way better than Brio's HH, but sadly that's a whole another review that's not even worth mentioning.  \n\nThe difference between Herb and Rye is that they stay true to their menu and offer most items at discount, 50% off to be exact, than creating a bogus menu.  Unless you dig that sort of thing then that's cool, but if you're like me then you'd want a real entree as meal.  Let me get a *dab*. Anyone?\n\nWe went with our bartender's few suggestions, Flat Iron steak with red pepper mash potatoes and gnocchi bolognese.  He let it be known that the chef recommend that we do not go above medium temp on the steak.  They didn't know it, but right then and there we \"click.\"\n\nOur meal was came out perfect.  Wasn't too much food, but just right.  Sooo darn good that i came back the next night after a long day trip to Cali with my sister to try something else that our bartender suggested since i really enjoyed the two dishes we shared the night before.  Unfortunately they were closed at 2am since they had a mixology tasting party earlier, but luckily I met, and excuse my spelling, Nickolay, the owner.  We chatted for a bit in the parking lot.  Found out we both once worked for the same guy before.\n\nFor 2 entree just barely under $25 this place is defiantly an option for a late night snack.

All are common responses when visiting Herbs & Rye. \n\nI have been so bogged down with work, or work related situations that I was set on treating myself to a nice meal. I called up a friend and we met up for happy hour. Both of us didn't feel like drinking, so we opted for their food specials. The deals are limited to five or six items, but they offer some meals for half off. Instead of just filling up on quick fryer food, H&R includes a few steak and a pork chop entree. We began with the spicy mussels ($10 HH, $22 regular). The tomato sauce was so good that I was scooping it into empty shells to slurp down. For my entree I got the 12oz. bone in strip cooked to a medium rare with the peppercorn brandy sauce and the truffle mac ($17.50). I have to say this was near perfection. Yet, I would have been happier without the sauce. My friend had got the same steak with the chimiccuri and asparagus. I stole most of her sauce. I should have listened to our server, the chimicurri was much more flavorful and bold. Usually I am not a mac'n'cheese person. My gaze usually zooms over these words, but Robyn and Kevin L. swears by it. Luckily, I trusted them and ended up a winner. \n\nBy the end, two steak dinners with an large order of mussels to start cost us less than $50.

Steaks 1/2 off were simply decadent. Brussel sprouts were the best I've ever had. I asked the bartender to make my drink with a tequila base since drink menu was too overwhelming for me to make a decision. My cocktail was as good as my food, refreshing and decadent! Just when I thought I'd gone to heaven, we ordered the bread pudding. My husband and I both agreed it was the best dessert we have had in a while! Service excellent. Atmosphere perfect.

The food is always amazing, the steak is so delicious. we first ordered the caprese salad, which was amazing but the size was too small for us, so we also ordered the spicy steamed mussels. The mussles were amazing!! it was a huge pot, I would even recommened ordering it as your entree if you wanted seafood. I ordered steak of course! The flavor of the meat is so wonderful, they only put a few salt, pepper, and baselmic butter on it when cooking. My personal favorite is the new york strip. It was a perfectly cooked medium steak. the side I picked was the mac and cheese with truffle oil. THIS WAS AMAZING! I would love to have a recipe for this!  The only reason i dont give them 5 stars is all based on the cocktails. I know they are supposed to be known for their cocktails but i personally wasnt a fan. I tried three different kinds and they all seemed to be way to sour for my taste. my face actually hurt from the puckering of my cheeks. I switched to beers lol. I will be back for more though!"

Turns out this was going to also be our server. This was my second time here. First was good, did not recall any issues. Unfortunately this visit was not so great. \n\nService was not good and it was not that busy. The bar area looked fairly busy but it was just as happy hour was ending. The dining room area was not busy. After being seated and getting some water to start, we waited for the server to come back to get our drink order. By the time drinks came back, we were ready to order. After placing our order (main plus a side). the server came back to inform us they were out of mashed potatoes. Really? Um, ok. So I picked another side. Once we did get our food, the steaks were luke warm. Being hungry and not having a server check on us or both trying to flag down someone else, we just took what we got.\n\nUnlike other restaurants where the server stops by to check on things, we didn't see much of our server after that. I remember one visit to check after we had our food and take a second drink order. Once finished and plates were cleared we wanted to get the check, but where was the server? No where to be seen. Then he shows up to ask about dessert and leave a menu, which we declined and just asked for the check. Soon as we got the check, I put my CC in hoping to have it taken back promptly, but no, the server disappeared again. After the check with my CC was sitting for a bit, someone else offered to take it for us. That other server than came back by to let us know our server was taking care of it. \n\nIn the end, I was disappointed since I know this is a popular place, they have a great drink menu and on my previous visit loved the food. However this recent visit was not worth a higher rating. I most likely won't be coming back anytime soon. There are too many other great restaurants in Las Vegas."

First thing we had reservations and got our table right a away, so 1 star for that. Fyi, we were the only ones in the dining room when we got there at 6pm on a Monday. Our waiter was excellent  and attentive, so that's my 2nd star. But on to the good stuff. We were not offered bread service, but others had it, maybe we had to ask? Others had it. Anyways, not sure. It was happy hour when we went so that meant 1/2 off some drinks, appetizers and steaks. We had the clams as appetizers, they were nice. I also had the wedge salad and they had no bacon. But did they tell me before I ordered? Nope. Who runs out of bacon? Are there not like 400 stores around to go buy some? Anyways, we decided on the kitchen sink stew (my husband asked to try some before but they said no.) and the 14oz New York steak. We also had 2 sides, the button mushrooms and the asparagus. The steak was great, cooked perfectly, the sides were ok,nothing special. My kitchen sink stew was overly spicy and there was tiny pieces of shell in it that basically gave me an anxiety attack while eating what I could as I was freaking out there was a shell I wasn't seeing. Even the waiter noticed there were small pieces in it. Overall a crappy experience, and one not worth repeating.\n\nPS, wow Herbs & Rye, judgey about what I look like? Shame on you!"

I was shocked to find customer service and quality control so horrendous this second time around! Long story short, this place has totally gone downhill and I likely won't be back. I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time coming here either unless you want your food to come out an hour late and then take a half hour at the end to pay your group's tab!\n\nRachel and I got here about 40 min before our party's reservation so we decided to sit at the bar for some drinks and salad as an appetizer. After being greeted by the bartender we didn't see him again for another 15 min and sat around waiting for our order to be taken. What bartender doesn't ask for a drink order right away?\n\nAfter everyone placed their orders we proceeded to wait about 45-50 min before any of food even came out. I was wondering if it was even going to come out at all! When our food arrived they brought everyone's except Roger's with no explanation of any kind...it was almost like the forgot that he had ordered anything. When this was brought to the server's attention she checked on it and came back to inform us that they had just \"fired it up\" and that it would \"be out shortly\" with no further explanation of what happened to the original order, nor an apology. About 10-15 min passes before the server returns to inform us that Roger's steak would be out soon and that they had overcooked the original one. Funny how they would wait to tell us this instead of being up front about it...I call bs!\n\nWhen Roger's steak finally came it was overcooked and not cooked medium rare like ordered. How hard is it for a steak restaurant to not overcook 2 steaks in a row?! After this debacle they still wanted to charge us for his steak at first and then decided not to in the end...I'm sure they heard that we were all Yelpers lol! But seriously this place is ridiculous. No updates on your food and no service whatsoever. It's almost like they don't care if their customers are happy or not, and we definitely were not.\n\nAt the end of the night we attempted to settle our table's tab. We had asked the server at the beginning of the meal to split our tabs, however, at the end of the meal she told us that this wasn't possible. WTF! Why didn't you just tell us that in the first place? The manager came out to explain that it was against store policy to split checks of groups with 6 or more people...Ok, so it's possible...you're just not going to do it? Who says that? Especially after the crap service we just endured? \n\nIt was a debacle trying to figure out the tab due to this and they had to run about a dozen cards separately. I almost wanted our group just to leave because the servers didn't know what was going on, except that they couldn't split the tab. If it wasn't for the manager coming out to handle the situation I'm pretty sure it would've taken longer than 30 min to figure this out and I would've just left. I don't have the patience or time to deal with crap like this. Get your shit together or don't run business! We were also pissed to see a 20% auto gratuity which is bs because they deserve nothing\n\nSave your time and your money and avoid this place. There are so many other steak places here in Vegas and there's really nothing special about this one. Steaks after overpriced just so they can do a \"happy hour\" 50% deal and even then the appetizers are $15, sides are $7 and sauces are $3.50 for such a crap place that's not even fancy at all."

My husband had a glass of champagne and thought it a bit sweet - he would have ordered more had there been a larger selection and a definitive brut.\n\nMy husband loved his steak, the 18 oz ribeye. It was so big he took half of it to go and it was done so perfectly that he was able to reheat it and it was still mildly medium rare the next day for lunch.

Its so romantic and the music is diverse, not too loud but noticeable. The bar is always packed 'cause of the amazing bartenders and the enormous list of cocktails. The service is just amazing.\n There's Mark, the \"other\" Mark, Alley, and of Course the lovely Brittany just waiting to greet you at the door. And you won't believe it but the owner, can be found behind the bar on occasion. Just gotta mention the back up servers too. Always smiling and quick to get you whatever you desire\nC'mon check it out!"

I wouldn't pay full price for it, but at half-price, I wouldn't mind making a return trip, though there are still too many steaks in Vegas I haven't tried. I ordered the rib-eye but would probably try the filet mignon next time. All steaks come with one side of your choice, which is pretty awesome for someone that doesn't like when you're limited to potatoes or chef's vegetables. I ordered the truffle mac 'n cheese, but I didn't notice any truffles, was probably just truffle oil. The asparagus that someone else got looked really good, though that side didn't seem as large, about 5-7 spears.\n\nI agree the place is too dark, I too couldn't tell how well cooked my steak was with the lack of lighting.\n\nThe online menu (as of 8/27/12) does not do the place justice. Their in house menu is far more extensive, with a good number of half-priced happy hour items.\n\nAlso, the outside of the restaurant looks like crap, but the inside is pretty nice."

The steaks are all on the 50% fire sale... seriously BLUE LIGHT SPECIAL AT Herbs & Rye! and its super tasty to boot! So drag your bootay over here off the strip for a split second or ten and descend into decadent gluttony for a bit.\n\nI arrived with a group of folks around 12:30 or so and most of us had had a few drinks already and had been gambling for a few hours. We hadn't had dinner yet as we were planning on coming here and had heard about it from one of my buddies who is a local. It was described as a great steak joint with cheap high end fare. It did not disappoint on that perspective whatsoever.\n\nPro Tip: Parking early can be tough, so be forwarned, perhaps taxi it over =D\n\nI got the 18oz boneless ribeye for $29 Dee LISH  Ushhhhhh. Normally it is $58! Well I want another one right now... and the bacon haphazardly tossed on top was awesome as well. I had the bacon topper which was two thick cuts of my favorite veggie crossed on top of the steak. WOW, just WOW.\n\nPro Tip #2: Do NOT ask for steak sauce unless you are an uncouth Neanderthal with no understanding of good steak. Some jackwagon in my group asked for it and a few of us had our eyes just about pop out of our heads!\n\nYou get a side with it and I kinda messed up trying something experimental but *shrugs* the steak and bacon were AWESOME.  But for my side I got the asparagus with the broccoli cheese sauce and it didn't turnout as well as I had hoped it would. \n\nPro Tip #3: Drink up before you get here. Their drinks are a bit pricy and kitchee IMHO. Unless you want to drink specialty drinks at $8-$15/ea...\n\nThe bread was fresh and super toasty tasty and just what you would need or expect for a meal like this. Ahhh the memories of this meal are still so fresh in my head I can taste that steak and the bacon strips! Since I have been here, I have had several friends hit this place up and no one has a bad thing to say about the steaks. \n\nI definitely plan on hitting this joint up again on another vegas run and I think you should too!"

Came at about 6:30 on a weekday and waited probably an hour to get our food. When I asked the waiter if our food was coming soon, he had the gall to ask, \"Do you have to be somewhere? Is there a certain time you need to leave by\" \n\nSo..... if I said 8, would you wait til a half hr before to get me my food? What kills me, was that it wasn't even busy... other reviews might talk about the waiters running around with their heads cut off, but it was not even busy. \n\n3 stars for the amazing deal on steaks (got a kansas flat iron for 14$... really not bad) \n\nbut there are virtually not HH drink deals (all 13$), and the other food was very average and expensive. \n\nI.e., \n\nflatbread - bruschetta style -- very mediocre $15 \nMac and Cheese, --only plus was the truffle flavor, but otherwise nothign special \nProsciutto penna pasta -- a whopping 22$ and it did not knock my socks off. \n\n\nWe asked the bartender (i think the owner) to make 3 different cocktails and he could not get it right... for a place that touts such an expansive list, you'd think he could make 1 well balanced cocktail, but he didn't really know what he was doing.  To his credit, was a nice guy, so 3 stars for that and the food)"

We called up to meet a couple friends who are locals and they suggested this place saying they had good food and interesting cocktails. After perusing the yelp reviews which are solid I decided we should listen to the locals and head off the strip. I really love checking out the local joints in Vegas, because there are so many places to choose from and a lot of times the strip places are amazing but quite pricey. We arrived a few minutes before our friends. I had used the handy dandy open table reservation through the yelp app! Upon arrival the words I said were 'don't judge a book...' The place seems like any other place you'd pass way out on the west side beyond the Rio. My boyfriend looked at me skeptically and then we walked in. Inside the intimate speakeasy type bar and dimly lit but very nicely furnished dining area we were seated in a big booth and handed massive menus. The server explained the cocktail menu was set up by time period each drink handmade by an awesome bartender with a fully stocked bar.  Each drink had a story of how it came to be and where it was popular as well as the ingredients. I was almost overwhelmed by the amount of choices until my friend ordered a drink called the bees knees and I copied! The server also informed us that happy hour was going until 8pm and that many items were 1/2 off including many of the steaks! Our 7pm arrival seemed to have been a miracle! My boy and I each ordered a 9oz filet with a side of dipping sauce, an extra but I love to dip, I had the au poivre sauce which was incredible peppery and perfect. We also split a wedge salad AND each steak came with a side! I chose the truffle Mac &cheese and boyfriend chose brussel sprouts with bacon lardon. We shared our sides of course, I shudder to say that I may really be becoming an adult because I preferred the brussels! Everything was perfectly cooked and to the exact temperature of our choosing. We had an after dinner shot of fernet to polish us off and when the bill arrived my jaw dropped! So much food & drink for such a low low price. We certainly were off the strip but you'd never know it by the food, presentation or service, only by the price. One more super cool thing is that you can order a 'surprise' drink from the bartender. They won't tell you the recipe but you can have them make you a special. My boyfriend asked for a special gin drink that came out quite tasty. All in all this is possibly my new favorite go to steak place off the strip. We will certainly be back for more tender juicy filet goodness in the near future."

There's not much vodka in the early years for some reason, not sure why.  I'm terrible with history.\n\nI wish I had come during happy hour, because it can get a little pricy.  The food is great though.  They have their own take on calamari which I recommend for everyone to get.  \n\nGot the spicy mussels also, which I don't recommend as highly as the calamari, but still good.\n\nI would def come here to hang out and have drinks, but more of a second choice for dining."

Now that's a rare occasion since more often than not, I do the cuisine-suggesting. The change was definitely nice and made for a few pleasant surprises.\n\nShe picked me up from MGM and took the backroads, clearly well off the strip to a local hang out called Herbs & Rye. \n\nUpon entering, you definitely are taken aback by how dark it is in there. Seriously, your eyes don't quite fully adjust until you are seated. We got there in the early evening and it was starting to get packed. Fortunately, my girl made reservations and we were situated in one of their awesome booths facing the bar. \n\nYou don't have pages and pages of menu to peruse through. Their offerings are simple and to the point, no frills here. Don't get me wrong, just because the menu isn't laced with words you can't pronounce or ingredients you've never seen, doesn't mean quality has been sacrificed. On the contrary, the seem to use products of utmost quality with particular attention to the entree's final outcome.\n\nWe had  a wonderful server, I'd like to say his name was Richard though I'm no longer sure. He was warm without being overbearing, made us laugh a little and suggested deliciously buttery chardonnay for me. \n\nBTW happy hour is awesome here, but many of their dishes, yes even the steaks at 50% off!\n\nWe ordered:\nCarpaccio - i have never had carpaccio before and this was just amazing. I would order this again in a heartbeat\n\nNew York Strip - We added bacon and oh my was that a thick cut piece of pork! They prepared it medium rare and seasoned just right\n\nTruffle Mac n Cheese - Although not too truffle-y, this mac n cheese was still a hit\n\nSweet Potato Tots - We got this with the marshmallow crust. heaven in your mouth. geez.\n\nMind you they have a very impressive selection of cocktails as well.\n\nWe skipped dessert this particular time since we were going somewhere else for our sweet treats. Regardless, our meal was fantastic and kudos to the folks at Herbs & Rye for the stellar experience."

Another time we told them we had a group of about 12 people coming, and I was told we are not allowed to have more than 6 people. I looked in the dining room and there was noone in there.

I Started off with a wedge salad that didn't disappoint followed by the 12 oz bone in Kansas City steak and side of truffle mac & cheese. The steak was tender, juicy and the mac & cheese was solid. \n\nOverall a good dinner with cordial service from my waitress at a reasonable price."

I got the bone in Kansas Steak, wifey got the Wedge Salad, and we split the Steak and Arugula Flatbread with Truffle Vinaigrette(not on HH menu, but we got it anyway). We also shared the Sweet Potato Tots and Truffle Mac and Cheese with fellow Yelpers at our table\n\nSteak was a perfect medium rare and the truffley goodnes of the flatbread was tasty, so was the wifey's salad...I love blue cheese dressing that \"sticks\" to your food and doesn't flow like a bad mess.\nthe sides were okay, not something I'd order again, just like their desserts...ALOHA!!!"

So, I got that and truffle fries. I also tried the truffle mac & cheese and the Herbs & Rye House Brew (HH price: $3). The sides aren't included in happy hour. We got beignets to end a great meal.\n\nBacon-wrapped Filet Mignon:\nIt had two thick slices of bacon on top and not wrapped around the filet. For a piece of steak that would normally be at least $50, getting this at half the price definitely changes everything. It was perfectly medium-rare, tender and juicy. 4.5/5\n\nTruffle Fries:\nThin-cut fries with truffles and parmesan cheese. You can taste and see truffles, yay! The fries were crispy. I enjoy truffle fries but what makes this even better is that it's less than $10! 5/5\n\nTruffle Mac & Cheese:\nAfter eating great truffle fries, I was disappointed with this mac & cheese. I couldn't taste truffles. It was like regular, plain mac & cheese. 2/5\n\nBeignets:\nThese aren't similar to the famous beignets from New Orleans. These are like mini doughnuts covered in granulated sugar. Normally comes with 2 dipping sauces: white chocolate and caramel but since I don't like white chocolate, our server threw in chocolate sauce. 4/5\n\nThe Kool Kids ordered Jack & Coke but it wasn't like Jack & Coke - our server later on said it's not really Jack & Coke, it was something else. That and my not-so-bacon-wrapped bacon-wrapped filet made me think we were getting punked by our server."

It can definitely get crowded but the food specials and the expertise of the bartenders is a site to behold.  The drinks are tasty and strong and the food is equally impressive.

Not sure if he was a manager, I did ask to speak to one when calling but this guy was extremely rude and unapologetic so who knows. He suggested maybe it was morning sickness/something to do with my pregnancy. Was told \"You're more than welcome to take a blood test.\" I'm pretty confident I know the difference between a hangover and well into my second trimester haven't experienced morning sickness in a while. He took my email and told me he'd get back to me after speaking to his staff and checking out footage from the bar. Never got an email. Never got an apology. I just want to leave this here for people who order these drinks pregnant or just avoiding alcohol. Not cool! Along with a \"manager\" who clearly doesn't care is just completely unacceptable."

I finally talked the boyfriend into it for their happy hour. \n\nFirst of all, there is hardly anything on the happy hour. 2 wines and a few well cocktails. Of course we wanted to try their famous cocktails which were not on the happy hour. They were $11-$13 each. We ordered Moscow mules and they were tasty. There also isn't very much food on the happy hour unless you're there for steaks which are 50% off but even at that discount are still pretty pricy. I am a vegetarian and when we mentioned there weren't many vegetarian options the bartender said \"nope there sure isn't\". Now I am a server and am always trying to accommodate vegetarians, vegans, gluten free etc and always have a few great suggestions to throw out. This guy wasn't even trying. Without his help we found some options. We ordered a caprese salad which was amazing, a Mediterranean flatbread, also tasty, and the truffle Mac n cheese which was bland and not very truffley. But overall the food and drinks were very good. \n\nMy biggest complaint was the service. Now granted we sat at the bar and ordered apps and drinks but the 2 bartenders really seemed to not care about us at all. They never checked on us and we were constantly trying to get their attention so we could order. When we finally did they acted like we were an inconvenience. At one point we had been waiting forever for the check and we needed to get going and so my boyfriend after finally flagging down the bartender handed him his credit card and asked politely if he could please run it for the tab. The bartender grabbed his card and threw it on the back bar and then walked away. We then waited another 10 mins for him to process it. It was very rude. \n\nOur total for 2 people was $90 and we had 2 drinks each and those few food items I mentioned. Incredibly overpriced and poor service? Needless to say we won't be returning."

(Gotta take Yelp with a grain of salt) We came in at 11pm sat in the bar booths and missed the happy hour. \n\nPro: food is generous in portion, even the flatbreads ($14)- 8 huge slices! I'm used to Blue Martinis flat bread which is a rip-off. The mac and cheese  ($7.5) was delicious and cheesy and flavored really well. Caesar salad was beautiful in presentation, but it took work chopping it up. The 3 Filet Mignon sliders were delicious, flavorful and just well put together. As opposed to the dried out sliders at Sugar Factory. I've sworn off the rip-off that are sliders just because of Sugar Factory.\n\nCons: The Diablo ($10) took forever to arrive- 10 minutes I'd say. It was only 4 people in the bar and we accounted for 2 of them. Not sure if the bartender forgot or maybe he was juicing the Agave?\n\n The server forgot to ask how we wanted our sliders prepared, which arrived medium rare. A real filet mignon is fine med-rare, but a ground up burger med-rare is close to raw. \n\nMore specificity on the menu i.e. how many of each item- $11 for a meatball appetizer is unheard of outside of LAVO.  It's 3 meatballs btw.\n\n\nOverall, Herbs & Rye re-imagines what real food is in Vegas. Not only was I surprised at the complex flavors of the food, but the mood and ambiance of such a quaint unassuming building really makes me want to go back."

After my second trip, I have to give it 3 stars, and here's why. \n\nOn my first visit, my friend and I decided to indulge in the happy hour special and we ordered the flat iron steaks. He ordered his with $3.50 extra house rub, I ordered mine plain. We also paid for two alacarte sides that we decided to split. When the steaks were placed in front of us, we weren't sure which had the rub and which didn't. We later found out that neither had the rub, but those were some damn good steaks. So good that we considered ordering second steaks. The flat iron was juicy, flavorful, and tender. I wanted to slap someone they were so good. We went around bragging about how wonderful the steaks were, and they were. At the time we thought, since we were charged for it, that both of our steaks got the house rub. \n\nFast forward to the next trip where we brought some friends along, we decided almost recreate our first trip. We got 3 Kansas City cuts 2 with the rub and one with blue cheese. Lets just say this is when we discovered that we paid for a rub that we didn't get and we also paid for sides that should've come with the meal. I had to verify, since the first server charged us separately for the sides whether or not a side was included with a steak order. That rub that we didn't receive the first go round was definitely not the be's knees.  A couple sitting in the both next us thought the same thing. Finally, my friend who got the blue cheese topping on his steak really wanted more steak than blue cheese. Blue cheese is pungent enough that the entire 12oz piece of steak did not need to be covered in it. I took a bite of his steak and tasted no steak at all, just blue cheese. \n\nMy advice, get the flat iron with no extra anything."

We were seated relatively quickly in the room to the left of the entrance. We ordered the following dishes:\n\nWings (Hot Buffalo) - Nothing special\nNew York strip - good but nothing to rave about (probably would rave about it for HH prices)\nFlat iron steak - the bf's dish\nPeruvian chimmirchiri sauce - one of my favorite sauces of all time...but here again nothing super memorable\nDoughnuts - great! fresh and nicely sugared...yum just thinking about them\n\nAll in all the place is great...I think if I were to ever go again...I would try my luck and go for happy hour. I mean there are tons of great places to eat in Vegas for $$$."

But I can't remember ever being as woefully disappointed in a HH menu as I was here.\n\nFirst, the good: \n\n-- The ambience.  Loved it - all that dark wood, flocked wallpaper, cozy, dimly-lit, romantic.  \n\n-- The service. Our waiter, Ronny, couldn't have been more attentive and patient.\n\nBut it went downhill quickly when we realized that there was nothing on that HH menu that would work for us.  The wine was a piss-poor selection of just a couple of whites or reds that neither of us would drink.  The beer?  What bar has NOTHING on tap???  I'm not a beer drinker, but my husband wasn't blown away either by the selections or prices.\n\nAs for the food, the only two HH appetizers available were clams or mussels.  We don't eat either of them.  Flatbreads (not on HH)?  The price for the one with steak was the same as one with just tomatoes. What a concept. We weren't about to bite, knowing we can get the same tomato and cheese flatbread at Kona Grill HH for nearly 2/3 less.  Sure, it's not the same atmosphere, but you can't always eat the atmosphere.\n\nThe only main course available was linguine with clams.  Not clam sauce, which I (but not hubby) would eat, but clams, just like in the appetizer.  I'm shell-averse.  I don't like to work for my food; if I did, I'd have stayed home and cooked.\n\nThe steaks would have been okay, if we were craving a juicy steak.  We never crave juicy steaks, and had already exceeded our beef quota for the week.  We weren't about to exceed it just because it was there, since it's never a first choice for us anyway.\n\nIn the end, we had our drinks - a low-end beer for Herb and a very good non-HH Riesling for me - and then went for pizza, and it was infinitely more satisfying."

They have some pretty good Happy Hour specials. I can't wait to try their flatbread pizzas and steaks, but on this occasion I ordered the meatballs with chorizo and the sweet potato tots. We were just making a short pit stop here on our way to dinner so didn't get an opportunity to try all the menu items that I was craving. The meatballs were lovely. Delicious and spicy. The sauce was delightful and I was hoping for a roll or some bread to sop up the rest of it with, but the bartender claimed they were out. We tried to order the bruschetta as well, but were told they were out of that too, so I guess I have to believe him on the bread thing. The tots were ok. Pretty much exactly as you picture them. Sweet potato tater tots, so self-explanatory and not really worth further description. Pretty good on the whole though. \n\nNow for the drinks. At $5 a pop for well drinks they certainly treat you right. There was barely a hint of tonic in my vodka tonic, which I had a hard time downing at first, but was much easier with an extra lime and some food to make it go down easier. \n\nGreat deal in general. I look forward to my next visit!"

I've been remiss, this review is a bit late but the old adage applies: better late than never. Herbs and Rye is, in a word, extraordinary. Okay, Las Vegas extraordinary if you will.  Imagine a dimly lit dining room, not large, but roomy enough to accommodate a good sized crowd. The usual bustle of a restaurant including the ambient sounds of servers taking orders, drinks being prepared and patrons boasting about the deliciousness of their meals or cocktails.\n\nWe started our evening at the bar and ordered a couple period cocktails. The Original Collins and the Martinez. Both were fantastic, but agreed we wouldn't name a favorite opting to continue trying them all. Each period cocktail has a unique taste, they really are special...each and every one mixed with expert care. It's loads of fun to sip and chat about that point in history. We opted to dine right at the bar, why not have access to master mixologist and owner Nectaly?  Ribeye for me, New York for him with his fav peppercorn sauce. Jalape\u00f1o creamed corn, mushrooms and truffle mac...all delish, I could have had a 2nd helping of the corn, it was that good.  Way too much food, but leftovers were just as tasty.\n\nIt gets quite busy here though I've never had a reservation as we tend to visit on the slower days.

This was no exception.\n\nFriday night we shared a carpaccio (a fave of mine, as some of you know, and so I am ultra persnickety about this dish), a pork loin dish, salads, and... I feel like we had half the menu between us... and there were only 5 of us! The food was perfectly cooked (or not, as appropriate), seasoned, and, truly, wasn't on the plate long at all. A lot of \"you *have* to taste this!\" and \"I'll fight you for the last bite of that...\" was heard amongst our little group. (To be fair, I think I may have stabbed someone with a fork while uttering that last bit...)\n\nNot to be outdone by the food, the bartenders were on their game. We all went for the \"Herbs & Rye\"... a drink that is decided upon by whosoever is keeping the bar. We were treated to their famous classic cocktails (one of the best menus in town for these oldies but goodies), never receiving the same one twice, and sometimes finding them with a twist or a dash or a splash, to make them even more creative. Much like the food, drinks were passed around and lauded and coveted. Repeatedly.\n\nThe space is small and cozy without being stifling or claustrophobic, the decor is dark and enveloping, lit perfectly, and seems to transport you out of Vegas - or maybe just to a Vegas long gone (in other words, no seizure-inducing, flashing-light video game machines or clang of slots machines). \n\nIntimate and social all at once, there are romantic booths, classic table seating, or, do what we did... belly up to the bar and trust the people behind it. You won't be disappointed."

I like the steaks (And, at either Happy Hour they are a steal at half-price!) and several of the pasta and Italian dishes, but the Flatbreads are the gold here.  The Bistecca is a well-balanced combo of crisp, fired, cracker-like flatbread topped with a perfect balance of cheese and steak, all topped with a mound of peppery, salty Arugula.  This is great accompaniment to any cocktail.\n\nAlso, I found the Pasta Carbonara (They don't call it this, but peas, bacon/ham and cream on pasta is Carbonara.) to be excellent - I've ordered it twice.  I will say it is incredibly rich, so be prepared for it.  Also, don't let it sit too long because it loses its pop if it cools too much.\n\nNow, the coctails are definitely \"where it's at\" at Herbs and Rye.\n\nAfter my first evening finding this place - desperate for a real cocktail, not beer, wine, or Frat Party Specials - my friend and I sampled about 10 of the cocktails between us.  With the exception of ones we just didn't like from preference, all were great!  Here's my deal, if you can make me a Blood & Sand that is coherent, I'm pretty satisfied.  If the Sazerac tastes good, I'm home.  Both met my test.  For something easily approachable, try the Aviation.  For something with a punch, the Corpse Reviver #2 will do the trick.\n\nThe one thing I would like to see is more consistency in the service.  The staff is all very friendly and helpful and knowledgeable, but the one time I've held a party there, they seemed a bit \"run around\".  Also, I rarely see more than one bartender, which is not enough for busier hours, especially during a happy hour.\n\nA note about the Happy Hour, it's one of the few in town to offer items from all parts of the menu - with the exception of the Classic Cocktails - and one of the only ones that runs until 8pm, and then picks-up again at Midnight.  You can start and end you evening here easily.\n\nBottom Line:  If you want good food, atmosphere and OUTSTANDING cocktails, go to Herbs & Rye."

I chose from the \"Years of Reform\" menu, specifically the \"Lion's Tail\". This is a Rye Whiskey based drink with bitters, lime, bar syrup, and Allspice Dram. It was a very good cocktail with great flavors and nothing too overpowering. I could have had another, but the first drink took so long I didn't want to wait for another.\n\nWe also ordered some fried calamari to snack-on while we hung out. This was a pretty basic plate of fried calamari, but you get almost an entire ocean's worth of fried salty morsels. This is a great option for sharing with friends, but the no mind blowing flavors here. \n\nI do love the prohibition look of this place and the dimly lit secret agent vibe, but I was wanting more.

I've only gone a couple times so far, but the perfect storm of quality food, excellent customer service and happy hour half priced steaks has won me over immensely. \n\nEach time I have come here I have been treated awesomely right from stepping in the door and being greeted by the friendly hostess. And the waitresses Donna and Debbie are fantastic as well. They are friendly and they go above and beyond to take care of you. \n\nI have opted for the 18 oz. Rib-Eye both times and have been very pleased with it. Rib-Eye is my go to steak in most any circumstance. I did try a bite of the New York Strip and that was pretty fantastic too. The sides are incredible. My favorite is the truffle mac and cheese, but I have also been a fan of the garlic mashed potatoes and the truffle parmesan french fries. The steaks come with one side order and during happy hour, they are an absolute deal. They also have $5 well drinks and I think a $3 amber ale, if I remember correct. If you want Jack, they charge you $8. That's my one knock against this place, but I'll live. The bread also isn't bad and definitely hits the spot while you wait. Nothing really to write home about, but better than nothing while you wait. \n\nThe ambiance of the place is pretty classy. It's dim and the walls are lined with a nice velvet looking wall paper that looks pretty elegant. It's the kind of place you would probably want to dress up a little for. \n\nOverall, Herbs is most likely going to be a regular spot of mine when I need my steak fix. If you haven't checked it out, do yourself a favor and head over there. Best time would be during one of their happy hours. The first one is from 5 to 8 and I think the second one starts at 11. Oh and they're currently in the process of changing out their beer and wine menu along with adding a few food items including a Porterhouse. More reasons to check back."

The wait staff is also a good representation of the setting. When I say that, I mean they're really nice and personable, but also know when to give your group space to ease in. Our server Mark (sp.) was not only nice, but he was also knowledgeable about the menu. He told us the background on the meats and his favorite menu items for recommendations. He even threw in a few jokes to jab at our friend for being late, then eating off of us 'cause he had sushi before our get-together. LOL. He managed to get him to order a few drinks.\nI also have to give him and the bartender kudos for making a drink that wasn't on the menu, but I thought I'd give a shot at asking for. It was an Old Fashion, sour, with brandy and olives. They even made it \"Wisconsin style\" for me 'cause it's common in the Midwest, but uncommon in the West. This is honestly the first place (well stocked and equipped bar) that made that drink right for me. XD Anyway...\nFood was scrumptious! The Meatballs & Chorizo was yummy with the tomato sauce and Feta cheese. We all ordered the Ribeye with different sides, one was cooked a little too rare for my friend though. For sides, we chose Truffle Mac 'n Cheese, Garlicky Spinach and Brussels Sprouts & Honey Swino. All yummy, but my favorite is the Brussels Sprouts (thinking it's because of the bacon). The sides are in small dishes, so it doesn't come proportionate to the size of the steak unless you'd like to order additional stuff. Ahahaha... Fine by me though 'cause I just had my leftover steak to go and made it for breakfast with eggs and hash browns. For dessert, we had the Bread Pudding with ice cream, and the H&R Doughnuts that comes with 1 caramel and 1 white chocolate sauce. Oh my gah... Don't even ask me which one I liked more 'cause I honestly can't decide. Mark did tell us that the Doughnuts are always a popular item though. \nFor about 6 drinks, 3 steaks with 1 side each, and 1 appetizer, I think the bill came to around $200-$245 with the gratuity."

Aside from the half priced steaks, there were only 3 appetizers that were half off. Started off with the chicken wings with Thai sauce, we really liked it. Nice crisp wings and the sauce was good too. We all decided to order some type of steaks, I had the Kansas Steak and my 2 other friends ordered the rib eye. Our sides were truffle fries, truffle mac n cheese, and mashed potatoes. My Kansas Steak was really good and my friends agreed their rib eyes were delicious as well. I had the mashed potatoes, which I really enjoyed too. The food is worth coming back for hands down, however the reason for my 2 star review is because the service was horrible. Our server was Ronnie and he seemed kind of un patient with us. For instance, when we asked him to explain the HH to our friend who came late because it's kind of complicated, he rudely adds \"Not really\" and then explains to her what is included. There was an attitude problem I felt like to the point we were going to walk out.  Whenever we asked him for something we felt like we were walking on egg shells. My friends and I all work in service industries and know what it takes to be rude to a customer and this guys certainly was. I certainly do hope he was just having a bad day because we really enjoyed the food."

The first time we went, it was so dim, my bf's mom needed a flashlight to view her menu. \n\nI've gone twice and had the same server both times, Ronnie. He was very patient with my demanding party. One of the ladies in our group wanted to customize a drink (when they already have a long list of super special specialty cocktails) and wanted A-1 for her filet. So anyways. \n\nThis last time we went, everything took a really long time. I'm not sure if it was our server's timing or if the kitchen was slow. Either way, I think it was a fluke because our first experience was fine. \n\nI think a dinner here is in the $25-40 range. \n\nWe went during happy hour. During happy hour, it's -50% from well drinks and select items from the menu. My party of three each got a half-off entree. \n\nBeginning with the cocktails. Their specialty cocktails are crafted with a history of alcohol in the US in mind. The cocktail menu is listed with era in mind (the Golden Years of Drinking, Prohibition, Reform, etc), with the liquors and garnishes relevant to the drink. Very nice. I got the Aviation, an herbal recipe of gin, creme de violette, and lemon. (By the way, I don't know how much the cocktails cost because someone else grabbed the tab both times I was there). \n\nThey have a full bar and also serve Le Grande absinthe. \n\nThe menu is American traditional and very small. I had the Fettucine Alfredo ($12, $6 during happy hour). It was pretty basic. Really nothing special. I also had a Caesar's salad with salmon ($11). Likewise, it was a basic dish. One thing that struck me, though, was the dressing had anchovy in it and it was like, the first thing that hit my palate. It was good (I love anchovies), just the right blend. \n\nMy mom got a nine ounce filet ($25, $12.50 happy hour) and my bf got the 17 ounce ribeye ($26, $13 happy hour). He ordered it rare and got a medium rare. All of the steaks come with a choice of two sides: Button Mushrooms, Jalapeno Cream Corn, Asparagus, Garlic Mash, Truffle Mac and Cheese, Crispy fries, Sweet Potato Tots. Might I recommend the tots? They are, how would you say, exquisite. \n\nFor dessert, we shared a caramel flan. It was a little different from other flans I've had. It was a little less custardy and almost cakey. Like cheesecake.\n\nFor the three entrees, a salad, a dessert, and six cocktails, the tab came out to about $100. Not bad. \n\nThe ladies bathroom is disproportionately large compared to the rest of the joint. Two stalls and kind of ill decorated. \n\nBut the restaurant is nicely done to continue the speak easy or Roaring 20's feel. The restaurant is partitioned in to two sections: the front and the bar. Next to the bar, there are about six semicircle booths facing the bar (and the flat screen tv's ... smart). \n\n* off the strip, non-casino"

I looked around and immediately was reminded of Fangtasia from True Blood.  There's an old school vibe with the brick walls, red and black wallpaper, chandeliers. and private dark leather booths. The background music was modern and made me feel like I was a vamp tramp. (Yeah, I'm a dork.) I know the theme is prohibition but I couldn't help but think of Fangtasia. Needless to say, I really dug the vibe and decor.\n\nMy friends and I came for happy hour. I was a little disappointed that cocktails weren't on the happy hour menu as I read about how well crafted and delicious they are. I was on a budget so I settled on a draft beer which was like $4-5 (I can't recall). \n\nThe best part about happy hour is the food. Unlike other restaurants where you get small bites off of the appetizer menu, here you get 50% off hefty entrees. I ordered a Kansas City Steak Strip with Truffle Mac and Cheese for $15! My husband got the Flat Iron Steak with Jalapeno Cream Corn. We all ordered different items off of the happy hour food menu and everything tasted like it was fine dining. \n\nWhen our waiter mentioned their homemade donuts, we were sold. The donuts came with two types of dipping sauce but I preferred to eat them plain. They were so fresh and fluffy and definitely worth saving room for.\n\nService was wonderful. We never had an empty glass. Our waiter was friendly and answered all of our questions. \n\nI would definitely come back again to try the cocktails and to have another perfectly cooked steak with the mouth watering truffle mac and cheese. Maybe next time I'll sit at the bar and try to look dark and mysterious to match the vibe of this place."

The stand out feature of Herbs and Rye is really the atmosphere. The velvet wallpaper, copper walls, the cheesey electronic piano guy. I love it ! It was relatively empty on a Saturday night and quiet enough to carry on a conversation - my kind of place ! \n\nI tend towards the more girly on my drinks so I can't say the drink list was particularly appealing to me. That being said, if you're a rye drinker (as the name implies!), you'll love the drinks here. My Hemmingway daquari was decent, but not a drink I'd drive across town to drink again. \n\nAs many have mentioned - the Happy Hour is insane. I love the fact that it goes till 8 PM (note, the Yelp hours are currently wrong at the time I'm writing this review). Tons of great food options on the HH menu:\n\n*Chicken cordon bleu ($8) - chicken itself was deilghtful but the risotto it was served with was the worst risotto I've ever had ! It had a scoop shape like it had come out of a mold and it was really dry. Honestly good risotto shouldn't hold a mold shape, it should pool in a puddle of goodness on your plate. Minor detail.\n*Ribeye ($15) - served with choice of 2 sides. Ribeye itself was very tasty. No, for $15 you're not getting the type of steak served at Cut, but it blows every other \"discount\" steak I've had in this town out of the water. Again the sides here weren't all that special. Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. Wouldn't pick either of those again despite those being my normal favorites. \n*On a sidenote I did try the flatbreads at the Yelp elite party and those were fabulous - even cold . I'll have to try one of those next time.\n\nServed with dinner was delightful bread with the coolest butter I've ever encountered. It was honey butter with chives and parsely . Sounds gross, but the flavor worked for me. It was so intriguing ! \n\nOverall a great experience was awesome service. Fun atmosphere, great for a date or a group of friends. If they could get their sides up to snuff this is a 5 star place for sure."

It is a very interesting restaurant. We got a table in the bar area, the wall paper had velet decor on it,  we thought it was a nice touch. The drinks were great, the menu is quite extensive. We started out with a ceasar salad, the dressing has a bit of a kick to dressing, it was a delisious surprise. My girlfriend had the surf and turf and I had the filet and ordered a side jalape\u00f1o cream corn. Everything was great! I would recommend getting the surf and turf though,  you get more food for your money and it comes with two sides, and the steak has a delisious red wine sauce. Service was great!"

They not only have excellent classic cocktails, they also have excellent food. This is far from your typical local bar.\n\nLet me start with their cocktails. Their classic cocktail menu is unrivaled. I love poring through the pages in search of my next beverage. It's just so detailed and well thought out. If knowledge is power, then the Herbs and Rye menu will make you a Cocktail superhero. Every drink has a little tidbit about its origin. It's also organized in chronological order. Want something from the Prohibition era? Herbs and Rye has got you covered. Perhaps something from the Gothic Age of American Drinking? Wait. What the heck does that even mean? Regardless, they have your back on that too!\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Herbs and Rye has some fantastic food offerings. Did someone say happy hour? A selection of their steaks are half off during HH. On my first visit, I went with the Kansas City Strip Steak with a side of Truffle Mac and Cheese (during HH, you only get one side instead of two). While the steak was flavorful, I admit that I was envious of my neighbor's Flat Iron. I'll definitely get that one instead next time. Outside of their steaks, I've also had the Clams from the appetizer section (also half off during HH). OMG those were incredible. It's basically a bowl of clams in a buttery sauce of awesomeness. On the side come two pieces of toasted baguette. Trust me when I say those are not enough. I ended up asking for more bread just so I could soak them in that buttery goodness. Yes, I know. Healthy as can be.\n\nWill I return? Is it hot in Vegas in July? Does it flash flood when it rains? Is it dark in here?"

From being greeted at the table, to receiving our drinks, to the food coming out (took a very long time), to the server doing a check back. The quickest thing she did was drop a bill. OUR service was so bad that we finally were abled to ordered our 2nd round of drinks partially into our main meal (after asking 3xs to see our server). BUT we cancelled our drinks as they were arriving bc we were finished with dinner and about 15-18 mins had passed from when we placed the 2nd order.\n\nOur party was of 6 which means autograt so that might explain the lack of service. But if she could bump our checks up with a 2nd (maybe 3rd) round of drinks, then her check and autograt would had been higher so still confused on the lacking service. Anyhow we paid and left and as our party was leaving, I asked a different server for the mgr and he said he's the gentleman at the hostess desk with the beard. So I waited at the desk for his return...and I waited...and I waited. I waited so long that I witnessed a party of 4 come and to be seated, never greeted and talked about where they should go instead bc of the lack of service. I waited at least 10 minutes that my group said \"Let's just go\" and since I couldn't speak with him, I'm leaving this long negative review that I wanted to avoid. Herbs & Rye is good and well known. We visit frequent but after our last visit, we won't rush back."

Always ask the hotel/casino employees for the best places, they will know what's good, inexpensive, etc.  My wife and I are staying at Caesars, many many choices of dining to choose from, most of them probably going to ding you at least $100 per person, so we tried this hole in the wall on W Sahara, about a $15 cab ride from our hotel.  Older building and decor, sort of a Victorian style, very dark - you get a distinct '60's feel in there.  Their dinner menu features many $50+ steaks, however they run a \"happy hour\" from 5pm-8pm, where most of the entrees are discounted 50% - my $42  14oz. NY Strip was $21, my wife had the 9oz. filet for $26 (menu price $52), and so on.  We had Little neck clams as an appetizer - $12.  Cocktails were reasonable, my wife's Manhattan was $11, my Grey Goose vodka was $13, and the first time I've ever seen this - was charged $1.95 for a \"large ice cube\".  The drink was great, I didn't complain, but I haven't seen a charge for an ice cube before.  Steaks were cooked to perfection and were excellent.  We noticed there were no salt and pepper shakers on any of the tables, I think their philosophy is that you're not going to need to doctor your steak in any way - in our case that was 100% correct, they were great!  Sides come with your entree, we opted for the Smashed Whiskey Potatoes (yum) and the Garlicky Spinach (also yum).  We were full, but had to try their signature Doughnuts (see photo), home made and decadent.  We got out of there paying a $114 check, which was not bad considering 3 cocktails (including my $1.95 ice cube), an appetizer, entrees and dessert!  Very friendly service staff, this is a must-try place on your next Vegas visit!"

This dish was a huge explosion of flavor! Although I was hesitant to get the pork chops (almost every restaurant I have ever been to has overcooked them) these pork chops were moist and cooked perfectly! My mouth is literally watering just thinking of them.............\n\nWe shared an order of truffle Mac N' Cheese and although it was pretty effing good, it was a little too truffle-y?\n\nThen for dessert, we opted for their freshly baked donuts that come with a white chocolate and caramel sauce. These are SO good that on a different night after, we ordered them to go. JUST THE DONUTS. I called in and was a little embarrassed just calling in for donuts to go but the lady on the other line just giggled and said they get that all the time, so I felt better :D They're THAT good, people!\n\nThe whole experience was pretty awesome. The service was great. Our waiter was very knowledgable of both the drink and food menus. He came by a few times to check in on us and even recommended the steak that my bf eventually got. I like the romantic ambience, the only thing I don't like about it is where it's located.

Rock hard, completely black on the bottom... the cheese was so overdone it wasn't even white anymore! When I complained and had it returned, I was basically sneered at. We ended up spending $500+ but good service couldn't even be provided. Amazing. \n\nOverall, horrible experience. Money not well spent. Next time we are looking for a happy hour, I'll opt for a place with happier employees!\n\nPS, the linguini is one of the only dishes on the happy hour menu for a reason. It sucks!"

The server was a bit annoying but he did an excellent rundown of the menu.  I went approximately 30 minutes between water refills which was disappointing.   this was clearly an oversight due to the restaurant being so busy.\n\nThe meatball with chorizo appetizer was excellent.  That was definitely the best thing I ate.  My medium-rare steak tasted too bloody for my liking.  The mac and cheese was mediocre.  The cream corn and jalape\u00f1o side was tasty but wasn't anything exotic. \n\nPrices during happy hour are reasonable, but given the location I'd say the prices are too high outside of happy hour."

They have an impressive menu of hand crafted cocktails to choose from and a fantastic dining menu as well. The mixologists serve up old school cocktail classics as well as new creations based on older traditions. This venue is not for vodka lovers as the majority of cocktails are made with whisky and gin. The stiff drinks are served up in the correct antique glassware in a venue that looks reminiscent of a bar scene in a film noir. Wear a fedora to complete the experience."

We called a few places and had no luck. I saw that this restaurant wasn't to far down the street, (Avoiding the strip at all costs), the reviews were good and the pictures made the place look classy. \n\nI called and a young lady answered the phone and before I could ask about wait times, she put me on hold. I was on hold for at least 7 minutes and I hung up. He said we should still try it and if it's to busy, we could keep looking. So when pulling up, I didn't like the look of it, just by the neighborhood. We found a parking spot and soon as we start to walk to the door of the restaurant, some man seen us and said \"Well look at you two\" We were dressed pretty nice. I think he was coming from the bar next door..\n\nSo I meet up with the hostess that had me on hold, and while standing there, she answers the phone and puts the person on hold. lol. I just giggled knowing that person will be waiting a while. Now that I am standing in the building, my whole outlook changed. It was dim lighting, not noisy and also not busy! We had no wait time!! We got seated right away, and in the back to ourselves. The service was so good, and they were always around when you needed them. \n\nWe started with a appetizer, which was the crab cake. I had never had one before and can I say I am officially obsessed with them now. We both wanted more after licking the plate clean. It was great, from the sauce, to the fish being cooked perfect.\n\nOur dinner was, Spinach Pappardelle, and a steak, with sides of Mac & Cheese and Mashed Potatoes. We could not stop talking about how good the food was. We would take a bite and rave about it more. I don't even like steak, and I could not keep my fork off his plate! We got so lucky with this place, on such a busy night. This place I swear found us, instead of me finding it. Perfect Valentines Day!!"

            "review": "Prior to heading out for New Years Eve a group of us booked a table at Herbs and Rye for pre-celebration food and drinks.  Sadly we had a very poor experience which seems at odds with the general high standards of review for this establishment.\n\nInitially thinks seemed ok, the server took our drinks order and placed the bread plates...then things began to go downhill. \n\nFirstly the drinks took an age to arrive. When they did the two Pilsners (Firestone) had a strange soapy taste to them. Eventually we managed to grab the waitress who after initially seating was very disinterested with our table. She took the drinks and came back with fresh ones, however, again the same soapy taste. I asked if the pipes had been cleaned recently at which point out of the shadows jumped the manager. He quickly said the pipes had been cleaned to their usual standards and maybe we weren't used to the taste of Pilsner...well I and my buddy are very used to the taste and I can tell you this wasn't right! I asked the manager if he himself had tasted it and he sheepishly replied that he had not and that he would go and taste it...he never came back to the table.  \n\nIt took about an hour for the food to finally arrive. The bread course never arrived.  A table next to us that arrived after us was also served dinner before us and got their bread. We would have loved to have had the opportunity to point the problem out but the waitress was nowhere to be seen. \n\nWhen the food arrived the steaks were tepid and the truffle fries cold. The entire meal had obviously been sat waiting to be served for some time. Again it took an age to be checked on and in the end we grabbed a porter and told him about the fries. He apologised and returned in about 5-10min with fresh hot fries. Once he had taken the fries back to the kitchen the waitress appeared and asked how the meal was, as we began to tell her the issues she completely ignored what we were saying and said she was glad everything was ok and she walked away. We were astounded!  \n\nAt the end of the meal the manager came round and asked if everything had been ok. We gave him a pr\u00e9cis akin to this review. He didn't understand the term 'tepid' which for a restaurant manager was pretty epic, and his solution to the problem was he would love to have us back and gave one member of the party his card.  He did offer a round of champagne or desserts if we so wished but as we had earlier explained we really needed to get going to Fremont. \n\nThe meal took 2 hours in the end and we only had an entree. When the check came the soapy beers had been removed and that was it. We asked for the fries to be comped also and the waitress disappeared for another 10mins. By this time we were exasperated and could not believe the poor service. We understand that NYE is a tricky time but the restaurant was far from being overly busy and looked to be on a standard service footing in terms of numbers in there.  The food we had was tasty, just not hot enough and let down with the addition of poor service. Disappointing Herbs and Rye, disappointing...treat your locals well if you want return custom and good word of mouth reviews."

            "review": "It had been about a year and a half since I last saw her, but she came blazing back into my life on my holiday trip to Vegas. Without much debate, it was agreed that we would spend Christmas day out in the desert to celebrate our happy reunion. I felt the winter desert chill under my jacket as the sun began its daily journey below the horizon. And she, dressed in green, looked as beautiful as the last time I saw her. She had not changed one bit, still living life like it would burn out within the span of a half hour's time. Like always, she stormed back into my life and took over, burning my lips with her kiss and devastating my emotions with her words. In her presence, every fleeting thought escaped into a rabbit hole into which I felt compelled to pursue with singular obsession and undivided attention. Why was the desert so brown? Why was this road that we were on so long and windy? And what the hell did I do with my meager existence in the years 2002 and 2003? Time slowed and every possible outcome which could result from our actions became all the more manifestable.\n\nAn entire day spent with her left me drained and unable - or unwilling - to move an inch when I finally went back to the hotel. After a very restful slumber, I awoke in the morning and decided that one day was enough. I could not be with her again for my last day in Vegas. She left in me a need of recovery and triggered an unexpected feeling of homesickness. During dinner that next day, I noticed a book that the bartender had at the bar titled simply \"PDT\". Upon inquiry, I found that it was indeed a reference to the bar in East Village. The bartender said he loved the drinks in the book and I asked if there were any place like that in Vegas. He lamented that sadly there aren't any, but there was a particular bar-restaurant which made prohibition-era and classic cocktails. What better way to quench my homesickness? Off to Herbs and Rye I went.\n\nHerbs and Rye was not located on the Strip, and it was definitely not within walking distance from the Strip, guaranteeing an establishment that wasn't inundated with tourists. It was the night after Christmas day, and the restaurant didn't have many customers. A lone waitress and the owner-bartender staffed the place. The mood was relaxing and and the lighting dim. I skipped the food menu and flipped to the drinks. Customers can easily tell that the owner was passionate about classic cocktails from what was offered on the drink menu. The drinks were divided into eras in which the drinks were popularised, including descriptions of the eras and history of each drink. Made with absinthe, of course I first had to order a Sazerac. Each sip of this clutched at my throat deliciously herbal and bitter. Next I ordered a Brown Derby, which I've never had before. Who knew honey and grapefruit could go so well together? With the bourbon, it made for a full-bodied drink with contrasting flavours. I must profess I liked the Brown Derby more. While I drank, I made conversations with the friendly owner about drinks and food.\n\nHerbs and Rye is definitely a restaurant I will be visiting again the next time I'm in Vegas, and I recommend it highly. My only regret was that the drinks, while delicious, were not made strong enough for my taste."

They're known for their steaks here but I personally didn't find it all that amazing. We ordered the truffle mac n cheese, the carpaccio, the ny ribeye, and to drink I got the pisco sour. The pisco sour was pretty good, with a good mixture amount of alcohol in it to keep me satisfied haha. The steak wasn't all too amazing in my opinion though, we ordered it medium rare, but it was still very plain tasting, tough, and chewy. It was more of a well done cooked steak. The truffle mac n cheese was okay as well but again I didn't feel it was anything special, the carpaccio was also decent but still no fireworks. Over all the prices are a little expensive considering I really didn't feel anything amazing from this place in terms of its food. Our waiter was extremely nice though which made up for it, he was knowledgeable about the drinks and menu and even offered us some nice suggestions we might like base on our taste. I wouldn't mind coming back here as a nice lounge around spot to bar hop for drinks if I am in the mood for a Chicago style prohibition atmosphere bar, but if someone asks me where I want to eat at in the future, unfortunately Herbs and Rye doesn't seem to be the first name that will come to mind."

Don't let the outside location deter you. The inside of Herbs and Rye had a great, dark vibe and was definitely not a Vegas Strip kinda place. I am quite certain its a local hang out. In fact, if I lived in Vegas- I would be a regular for sure. They specialize in craft cocktails, a favorite of mine and the reason why my buddy and I went. I had a Buck's Fizz (on the menu) which was a great refresher followed up by a Pimm's Cup (not on the menu) which was done well, although with Ginger Ale instead of Ginger Beer. My buddy had a Moscow Mule which was great and quite large drink which kept him occupied during our whole stay. The menu is divided into cocktail \"eras\" such as \"pre-prohibition\", etc. I thought that was a cool touch. A pleasant surprise was the food. Being a cocktail place they don't do drink happy hours, which I admire- however they do food happy hours...with several dishes offered at a discount. To take advantage I had the mussels in a spicy tomato sauce and my buddy had the fillet and mashed potatoes. Both were excellent and a great deal. So, in addition to recommending this place for a great pre-strip hopping cocktail, I would definitely get there for some grub prior to going back to the stock tourists hang outs."

The bartenders have a lot of fun crafting these drinks and as a patron I had a lot of fun drinking them.\n\nMisti and I also shared a couple of snacks to offset the liquor including a big mixed green salad that had bacon croutons. Um, yum! The other food we had was a Mediterranean flatbread that came with a blended spinach spread instead of tomato sauce, feta cheese, black olives and artichoke hearts. I really like the unique flavors of food and drink at Herbs and Rye so I can see why Misti is such a fan. I'd definitely come back on my next visit to Vegas and try more of what they're offering here."

Herbs and Rye is in the old Venetian Italian restaurant.  Loved the dark speakeasy vibe and brick walls.  Caution: let your eyes adjust or you will run over the hostess!  We started with the calmari appetizer.  It was crispy and served with a delicious aioli.  The crispy pancetta was a nice touch.  BTW - it was a very large serving. I order the filet mignon and it melted in my mouth!  My side was the crispy truffle french fries.  YUM!  They have an extensive cocktail list that is sectioned by time period.  I opted for the French 75.  It is one of my favorite cocktails and Herbs and Rye did not disappoint!\nOur server was awesome and kept us on schedule for our 7:30 show!  Love Herbs and Rye!"

Wow the decor and ambiance was pretty cool. I loved the feel of the place. Walking in was like a completely different place than the outside.\n\nMe & the beau seated at the bar to wait for our friends. I ordered a Moscow Mule & he got a Pisco Sour. My Moscow Mule was so good, I just didn't like how it was filled with ice so I basically paid for a cup full of ice, I woulda liked more drink for my buck. Pisco sour had egg white in it so it basically just tasted like foam, honestly. I then ordered a Pimms Cup. Oh how I loved that drink! & had cucumber chunks in it! So delicious! My recommendation for a drink if you go here. \n\nOur friends started to come so we got a table. We were waiting for the clock to strike 12am so we can take advantage of their infamous happy hour! I ordered a Kansas Bone In w/ that extra spicy rub with Truffle Mac n Cheese as my side! OMG to die for! That rub on the steak had little flavor fairies dancing in my mouth! My friend ordered the Penne Pasta. That was also extremely good, not part of their happy hour though. The beau ordered chicken wings and everyone thought they were so good, but I think they tasted like chicken wings! Lol. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nWhat really stood out to me was our waiter, Christian. He was extremely delightful, making suggestions for which cocktails we would like. One of my friends got what he has suggested & didn't like it and Christian brought him another drink for free! Also towards the end he brought us out some bomb sugar donuts with 2 mouth watering dipping sauces, also on the house! How sweet of him. \n\nOverall I loved this place.. I'll probably be returning very soon!"

Although my wallet was sad afterwards, I do not regret eating the delicious 14 oz NY Strip steak and truffle mac and cheese, unnffff. \n\nThe exterior of the place makes it look like some shady strip club or something because there were no windows just some doors. When we walked in I felt like I was in the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland cuz it was so dark. Nonetheless, never judge a book by it's cover! The atmosphere was great and the waiters and waitresses were extra friendly. \n\nAs for the quality of food, I'd say it has been spot on. The first time I went here was last year when I was craving Linguine and clams at 2AM and thankfully this place was open (you have no idea how much I love linguine and clams). It was a to-go order and service was fast. The linguine and clams wasn't the best I ever had, but! Being hormonal at 2AM, it was pretty damn good. & they used real clams, not that salty canned crap.\n\nMy most recent visit on the 08-24-15 was even better because I had a chance to actually sit down and enjoy everything right there. We started off with some appetizers of Spicy Mussels. It was a good amount of mussels drenched in marinara/tomato sauce and came with 2 loafs of bread. It was a comfortable level of spice and the fact that it was 1/2 off made it more merrier. \n\nI ordered the 14 oz NY Strip Steak medium rare and it included my choice of one side so of course when I see something like Truffle Mac n Cheese, hell freaking yeah I'm choosing that! Again, service was pretty quick. My steak was cooked perfectly. It was literally the most beautiful thing I had seen in days haha. I was a little disappointed in the Truffle Mac n Cheese though. It was good but not great :/ I felt like it wasn't cheesey enough or something. Idk it just needed a little extra something! It's my fault, I hyped myself up for Mac n Cheese all day that day. \n\nOverall I've had a great experience here. Waiters were on top of their water-refill game. I'd take like a small sip and it's like their water-refill senses shit was tingling or something cuz 5 seconds later they'd be over my shoulder refilling my cup haha. Definitely would recommend this place for a nice night out :)"

We went during the soft opening with our friends and didn't have a great service experience. However, they appeared to be feeling out the space and staff. Recently we returned with friends from out of town. We ordered off the cocktail menu. Which is mostly filled with classic prohibition cocktails. Then after a few drinks we started to order the herbs and rye (bartenders choice). This led to three rounds of perfectly crafted cocktails each costing 8 dollars each. Better than any speakeasy ive ever been to. NY, SF, LA, NOIR bar. The mixology program here is wonderful and i cant wait to go back.  Also, the two appetizers (calamari and flatbread) were fantastic.  Beware so called mixology bars with central locations. This place has great drinks, good food, and stays open late."

It is served by a different server, or a food runner.  Sure enough my sliders come out with sauce on them.  After the person drops off our food he leaves.  Clearly we all need refills.  Since it was so hard to find our waitress I decided to just suck it up and eat my sliders with the sauce on them.  After looking around, we finally see our waitress in a corner eating.  Umm okay, let's let her enjoy her food.. We flag down someone to get refills and a different person again later on to get our check.  Our waitress comes over to pick up our check and return it... What sucky service!!\n\nThe food was good, even with the sauce.  I will have to come back again and give this place a second shot.  Only because of the food.  However in restaurants, food and service go hand in hand.  Too often do I hear of places with great food losing customers because of crappy service.  Since I am a server myself, I will give her the benefit of the doubt and give it another go."

They serve your standard drinks of course but also, a huge array of prohibition era drinks.

However, the hostess told us that there's a 30min wait with no reservation. Huh? So we found a seat at the bar which was very uncomfortable for me. 5 mins after we were seated the hostess came and asked us if we wanted a table. Why didn't she offer us a table earlier before we placed our order? Lame.\n\nOur food also took a long time to come out, which didn't make sense because the restaurant was not busy. Drinks were $11 each, and very mediocre. We ordered 2 appetizers: garlic clams were pretty good, but the bacon calamari was the bomb! After that, I got my Kansas City bone-in with a side of brussel sprouts. Loved it!

I have been to Herbs many times in the past 2 years since I moved to Vegas, brought friends and relatives here for the drinks and food. Well let me tell you this was the last time. \n\nWe had a party of 12 and upon arrival we made it clear we wanted separate checks or 3 checks of 4 and wee told by the 'manager' on duty it wouldn't be a problem. SO the drinks came, and we ordered and as usual, the food was excellent and the drinks were great. We arrived just before 7pm to be sure we would get served for Happy Hour. Service was very slow for just about everything. We did not get our food until after 8pm and at 8:08 I ordered a beer and was told Happy Hour was over and it would be full price (this was after ordering 2 bottles of 40 dollar wine, multiple 11 dollar cocktails and beers). So when they say Happy Hour ends at 8, they mean it. \n\nAbout 9ish we had finished our meal and were waiting for the waitress to come around for about 15 minutes with the 'birthday donuts' and they finally did. Then we waited for the check....and waited.....and waited...spoke to the manager about the service we were receiving. SO we waited some more. Finally about 9:45 we got our check....ALL ON ONE BILL....when we told we were granted permission to get separate checks the waitress said she couldn't do it. We insisted she did so she took the check back and went out back....and we waited...and waited...NO DRINKS, NO SERVICE, NO QUESTIONS BEING ANSWERED. Finally at 10:20 I asked to speak to the 'manager.' He came out and gave a speech about how hard it was to divide the check up. I told him to ask the waitress to come out so we could help her with the check. The manager was of no help. Now we have been there for over 3 hours, nothing comped, nothing answered, and she comes out with the split checks and they are ALL WRONG. \n\nNeedless to say it was very frustrating. We ended up staying about 20 minutes longer to get the check straightened out and finally left. \n\nI'm now looking for the next best steak because I won't step foot back in that place after the way the manager acted."

I heard if you go during happy hour most entrees are half price which would have been great but we missed happy hour by about an hour. We were fine with paying full price because the food was spectacular! Order the tomato soup you won't be disappointed and there is a little surprise that comes with it. I won't spoil it for you just do it. The drinks were great the pims cup was my favorite a play on a Moscow mule with cucumber and mint. We also tried the New York strip with a chile sauce on it that was great and the truffle fries I heard the truffle Mac is great too but we were so full we didn't want to over do it. Do yourself another favor and ORDER THE DONUTS! Seriously best donuts in town I was expecting it to be a bowl of donut holes or something. No. They give you ten tiny perfect little actual donuts fried to perfection with two dipping sauces they were so good I would come back just to have those donuts. \nMark was a great server he knew exactly what to recommend and he was very friendly! Will definitely ask for him the next time we go!\nAll in all it was a great experience we will be back very soon thanks Mark you're awesome!"

She took our order wrong, food came out wrong, runner went back into kitchen, couple minutes later food came out right so no big deal. Debra however pretended it didn't happen and didn't even apologize. Again, no big deal. Left her a 18% tip and totaled it to 90$ on my card. On my credit card statement I was charged 100$. \n\nI Talked to the manager, Alennry, on the phone and said he was busy at the moment so he gave me his email to explain the situation. Emailed him twice over the course of two weeks and no reply. I ended up letting it go, convincing myself it could have been an honest mistake. \n\nApril 12th, 2014 rolls around and I decide their happy hour sounds good, which it is. Don't get me wrong it's a great happy hour. Again were sat in Debra's section. Funny right? This time I total my card to 33$ and I was charged 38$, same thing with my girlfriends card. Now I'm at the point where I'm very upset because it's clear Debra is forging credit card tips. Being a server in the Vegas industry myself I know this is the biggest no no. \n\nNow I go in and talk to Nectaly himself about the situation. He seemed very sorry and genuine about the situation and said he would get the money refunded. At the end of the day, the extra 5$ charged on not only one but both our cards is not a big deal, it's the principle that counts. Nectaly emails me saying he's getting statements from his merchant. Takes about a week but he finally gets them. Then he doesn't email back for a couple days and then I finally get an email saying he's in New York and will refund them as soon as he's back. I say that's awesome and couple days go by and no email or refund. I email again and now there's absolutely no response for a week.\n\nAnd now I'm writing this review. It's upsetting because like I said, their happy hour and food quality is awesome. But this is not the way you do business. The first time could have been an honest mistake but twice from the same server is no coincidence. You don't steal from customers, that's not the way you do business. Please take warning. The managers and owners seem to be more than okay with doing shady business."

I've taken even a few visitors here for late night eats as it surely beats having graveyard specials at a janky diner. We get to sit in a cozy, dark booth and listen to a really thoughful soundtrack if you like stuff like downtempo.\n\nThe main draw is every night from 5pm-8pm and 12am-close is HAPPY HOUR. No, it doesn't include the cocktails, but I believe well drinks and some beers are. The gem of it is the food. There is a limited half off food selection of various types of steaks, a few apps (currently spicy mussels and garlic butter clams), and a entree of linguine and clams. \n\nGet the steak! Its good quality for the price. I normally go with the 18oz ribeye (ends up like $20 at HH) or the Kansas City Bone In 12oz ( I believe $15 during HH) and it's been tender, cooked to the right temperature, and seasoned well that I don't put any steak sauce. It comes with one side and their sides are great here. I really like their truffle mac n cheese, sweet potato tots, or super garlicky spinach. No it isn't your dirt cheap steak special, but you get what you pay for and it's a great value considering the quality. We've brought even the BFs grandma and mom recently and both approved of the steak and would like us to bring them back.  \n\nWe also get the spicy mussels often during HH. It's a rather large pot they give you for the $11 HH price and the marinara is garlicky, a bit spicy, and needs to be sopped up. Ask for more bread - theirs is delicious, hot out the oven. \n\nThey serve some of my favorite consistent drinks. Drinks here don't rotate so much, but are all classic cocktails using a lot of small batch spirits so it speaks to my heart.  The BFs and my drink of choice is the Vieux Carr'e (Rye, Cognac, Benedictine, Sweet Vermouth, Peychauds Bitters, Angostura Bitters) since its just alcohol on top of more alcohol. I just find I like less sweet stuff over the years and just want something unfussy and you can taste the nuances of the alcohol. If I want something tart and refreshing for a change, I go for Blackthorn or Moscow Mules. I find both great for summer. I've also ordered mystery drinks here and have been pleased, whatever I was given. I think at this point they can peg my tastes pretty well. I shockingly haven't drank the entire menu yet (but close) and will report back once I do with a running list of what each drink is like.\n\nI think this place will always have a special little spot in my heart. It was actually the place I met all my Yelp friends, for the first time so it holds special memories. And throughout the years the steaks and the drinks have never disappointed."

Plus, both rounds took at least 20 minutes after ordering to receive.\n\nWasn't too keen on the food, unfortunately.  I really wanted to be wowed, but, all of us agreed that the food was just OK.  \n\nThe pasta, pork chops and 2 different steak cuts were well priced and of decent quality, just, nothing any of us would order again.  The truffle mac and cheese was dry and lacking flavor.  And the brussels sprouts tasted like they just threw cheese and bacon on them, but it just didn't \"mesh\" well.  Too bad, because I read other Yelpers swearing how yummy both are.\n\nCome for a round of drinks and the cool atmosphere!  Then, head out for dinner..."

Our main course was the Ribeye, truffle mac'n'cheese and asparagus....oh my god! Let me just say that was the BEST steak I ever ate. Oh and to actually have their steaks on the happy hour menu was the icing on the cake. \n\nThe reason for the 4 and not 5 stars was because we waited 1 hour for our main course. When we arrive we were the 2nd couple in the dining area we were seated at. However, by the time we order it was full, but most of all them seated after us was already eating. I understand the business, but that was a little too long and seeing others eating wasn't helping my hunger pains lol! \n\nBUT I will NOT hold that against them.

My salad was fresh and plentiful, the asparagus that came with my steak was deliciously seasoned and grilled just right.  The steak was a nice size, cooked a bit more well-done than I ordered (I'd asked for M.R., got Med.), was very tasty nonetheless.\n\nMy friend didn't fare as well, as his Filet was definitely over-done, but still flavorful. He, too, enjoyed his salad quite a lot.  I had water with my meal, as their wine is too expensive, and we'd had a couple elsewhere, anyway.\n\nMy three-star verdict is based on three things: four-star food, almost-four-star service, and two-star honesty.  The half-price steaks are a big gimmick in the sense that no one in their right mind would pay $42 for the NY Strip I had and be happy about it, and certainly not $59 for the Filet my friend had.  At half-price, they were just about right.  So the take-away is that you should NOT order steak unless it's happy-hour, because you will feel you've been SCREWED.  And by the way, the argument that everybody charges stupid prices for steaks in Vegas doesn't fly, because it's STILL stupid :)"

But, friends, the buck basically stops there.  \n\nImmediately we were greeted by a rank bathroom sewage smell that creeped out of ladies restroom.  That odor persisted throughout our entire meal.\n\nFor drinks, we ordered the house brew: really boring beverage; at least it was well priced.  We were starving and ended making a pretty eclectic food order: calamari, mediterranean flatbread, chop salad, pork and figs.  Everything was okay; super rich, a wee salty, but pretty good.\n\nHere's the point of my story: our bill came to $82, we left $16 for the tip and went on our way, glad to be smelling fresh air.  When the bill finally posted, we had been charged $36 for the tip!  I called 5 times, friendly each time, trying to get this rectified.  Each time I was promised a call back.  Not once did anyone call.  I even spoke to the GM/Owner, Nick, who told me he'd take care of it right away and to call back if I didn't see a credit in 24 hours.  The last time I called I was put on hold for a full 4 minutes and hung up.  I called right back; the line was inexplicably busy for the next 20 minutes.  I had to resolve the overcharge directly through the claims department at my bank.\n\nHad they shown any real intention to fix their error and followed through with even a single call I expect we'd go back: ordering better beer and lighter fare, yes, and turning around at the door if it still stank.  Okay.  BUT! to be disregarded entirely despite making my best and patient effort repeatedly leaves me with a foul taste, odor AND impression.  Not Going Back."

Okay, the rest of the food shows that the chef knows how to cook and present good food, damn good food in fact, so why does he think that buy in bulk US food fries should in any way, shape or form be found in this restaurant ?????\n\nSeriously, this place could easily hit it out of the park, but when you are charging $7.50 for fires, hand cut them, they taste better, they look better and they are cheaper in the long run.\n\nSo now you are probably wondering why I only gave 3 stars, sure if you know the way I rate places you would be thinking a 4 star review, well yep, minus 1 star for the BS fries.\n\nBut the service, wow, yeah, this was the let down for me in a big way, the place isn't that big, there were 3 waitresses working and yet they all seemed to be running around doing nothing, as I said, maybe a bad night, those do happen, but it really could have been so much better. Slow to take the order, slow to get drinks, slow to refill drinks, slow to clear plates, slow to give the check.\n\nThe place certainly has a great ambiance,  this is a place I would bring friends, one small issue, the music could do with being a touch lower, on a couple of the jazz numbers the trumpet note just went right through me, I could see the same reaction from a few others, so I am guessing it's not me just being an old fart...Though I will say, it's nowhere near the level of say Fire Fly which can be stupidly loud at times.\n\nLast little thing..The happy hour...If your going to offer a happy hour on food and drinks, maybe something other than the steaks and a couple of clam dishes, which btw, made them prices I would happily pay, the regular price for say clams and linguine is $28...Yeah sure.\n\nDrink prices as well, great to offer half price drinks, but when the regular price for a Pimm's cup is $22, your not really offering much, btw, the cost is just under a dollar to make that drink and while I will say, the bartender we were watching is maybe one of the best in Vegas, it's still a stupid mark up.\n\nYes I know, a lot of negative, easy fixes for the most part and yes, we will be going back, fingers crossed the service issues were just a bad night."

Came back tonight for dinner. \n\nOf course we still ordered cocktails. I had the Ward Eight which was a great balance between tart and sweet with a tad more tart. \nWe started with the calamari appetizer. It included peppers, and had a very light breeding with a house aioli and crispy prosciutto on top. \n\nFor my main course, I ordered the rib-eye.  Of course the cut was way too big (18oz), but I can't help myself...rib-eyes are my favorite! I ordered it medium, and it was slightly overcooked.  Still good though. \nThen I got the jalape\u00f1o creamed corn and it was delicious. Although, I would have loved more if they used fresh corn instead of frozen. \n\nLastly, when I was about to bust, and 75% of the appetizer, 50% of the steak, and 50% of the side were all in togos, they brought out the complimentary doughnuts. I am not a big sweets eater, but I couldn't resist and popped two of the tiny holes in my mouth.  They were very good, but if I even ate one more hole, I would pop.  My friend loved them, and the two dips and even took them home. \n\nIt's a little pricey here, but I will be back...the next time during happy hour for half priced steaks!"

My\nhusband and I have been visiting your establishment for the last 2 years during\nhappy hour and have always had an amazing experience. We have been served by\nRickey several times in the past, and left extremely satisfied and happy. I have always\nreferred people to your establishment when asked \"Where can I get the best steak\nin town?\". We've brought family and friends on numerous occasions as well.\n\nWe began our dining experience this evening at 6:30 pm. We were made aware, upon\nordering our food that if we were ordering a steak, to expect a 30 minute cook\ntime. We placed our entire order at 6:40. Chorizo meatballs, Truffle Mac and\nCheese and 2 Filet Mignons-cooked medium well with blue cheese topping and garlicky spinach. We anticipated our steaks to come out within the 30 minute \"window\" referenced, but they were not delivered to our table until 7:35. An entire 55 minutes later. I asked Rickey\nif the restaurant was short staffed that evening, to which he replied \"for happy hour, we\nare short-staffed in order to keep the prices low.\" When our steaks finally\narrived, they were overcooked and dry. And, instead of an apology, our waiter,\ntook out his light, and asked us to cut them in half, like we were at Chili's. He proceeded to tell me that medium-well meant light pink, to which my steak was GREY in color.\nHe then saw they were grey and a little \"overcooked\" and would be sent back. I\ntold him that I didn't want to wait another hour for the steaks, to which he\nreplied \"they won't take that long, there's always steaks already on the grill.\"\nNew steaks didn't return to the table for another 30 minutes. By this time,\nwe've been sitting for 90 minutes. Unacceptable in my opinion. I realize it was\nhappy hour, but this should never be an excuse as we've never encountered this\nbefore. We were told a manager was going to come to the table, but never did.\nBy the time we received our check, it was 8:30, and we had spent enough time wallowing in this disappointing situation. I have read all of the success stories and effort to turn this\nrestaurant around, and I have appreciated the service and food in the past. If I\nknew that I was going to be sitting for 2 hours, I would have gone to the strip\nfor a better experience. I'm not generally one to write letters or complain\nabout food not being cooked properly, as most of the time, it's rectified in a\ntimely manner. I was even more shocked that we were about to be offered dessert as compensation, and would have had to sit another 30 minutes. We politely declined. I've given the GM and the kitchen manager 4 days to contact me via reply to my numerous emails, but so far, they have not. It's a complete shame they don't have their act together in keeping local visitors who used to visit monthly."

I had made reservations a month in advance for (8) people at 6:30. The entire party arrived on time and wouldn't be seated until \"everyone was there\".... We waited in the bar for our table while struggling to get attention for a cocktail due to their very popular happy hour. \n\n7pm passed, 7:15 passed...still not seated. Almost an hour after our reservation time we were finally seated. We ordered appetizers right away which came out COLD about 45 minutes later. Our meals didn't come until close to 9:15pm, which were equally cold and disappointing. When the bill came (way after 10pm), the restaurant did the right thing by paying for appetizers and rounds of drinks but they also added 20% gratuity, which was not warranted. \n\nThis was a customer dinner with my boss and huge customer. I was embarrassed and reamed by my boss for the evening. There were so many other places to go, and should have chosen: \nHuge disappointment. Won't be back. Lost a great customer and a huge previous advocate."

I finally was able to visit last night around midnight ! It looks like just a bar on the outside, so driving by if you've never heard about this place, you wouldn't think it was anything special. But people, enough about it's \"in the ghetto\". North-town, Twain/Maryland Parkway, Boulder Highway, MLK/Charleston, THAT'S ghetto. Sahara/Valley View? Not the best but come on, not ghetto. Let's not get crazy.\nSoo anyways, the inside, kind of vampirey and a little dark, it takes your eyes some time to adjust but they have mini flashlights you can request. Oh and bring your glasses, goodness I felt like an old lady trying to read the super small lettering on the menu lol. There was lots of seating and at the time we came, not busy even though happy hour was going on (12-3). Happy hour was half off some steaks included with a side. Sounds like a great deal but my boyfriend and I didn't want something too heavy so we'll try it next time especially since everyone around us was taking advantage of that great deal and it looked delicious!\nOnto the drinks! Oh my goodness, soo good, AMAZING. After my first drink, Weekend at the Walfdorf, which is a fruity rum based drink, I made part of my life's goal to try all the drinks on their menu Lol. Next I had the infamous Moscow Mule that I've heard soo much about. The best I've had. Perfect amount of fizzyness and Ginger. Yummy!! I'll take a liter for home please Lol. My boyfriend had the Ramos Gin Fizz and it was another amazing drink especially if you love Gin. It had a lemon tang to it and frothed egg whites. If you're from San Fran, my boyfriend said the quality of drinks were very similar to Burritt Room & Tavern in Union Square.\nNext, the food. Carpaccio was flavorful and I always like when restaurants serve an argula salad on top, so really good. I wish there was a little more capers though. Very comparable to carpaccios I've had on the strip. The Pork & Figs we shared was large and really delicious as well. I loved the sauce and figs, and the mashed potatoes. The pork was not as tender as I liked it to be but the Gorgonzola on top made up for that. I could definitely see myself craving this dish. Now let's talk about their amazing donuts. Wow. First of all, I think there's like a dozen mini donuts & holes sugar coated and was served super soft and warm. Definitely enough for four people! But since they're soo addicting, two people could easily demolish these even with a full belly. It came with two sauces, I forgot the names but it seemed like a white chocolate and caramel. Lick your fingers good Lol. \nI just really wish that this place had a higher quality feel to match the great quality and pricing of the food and drinks they serve! You can still look prohibitiony and sleek at the same time! Lol The service was good and friendly, drinks took a little long but they are hand crafted cocktails! The poor bartenders even had to froth up egg whites for one of our drinks! Lmao I will definitely be back for their happy hour steak special and their drinks!! :)"

I have a few things to complain about, I suppose, and I hardly ever complain about my experiences with food. This is actually my first yelp review. \n\nI'm pretty damn sure they raised their prices on a few food items. The filet mignon happened to be one of them. That's my usual with a few sides. The sides were up to par with my past experiences, but the filet mignon is the reason for this review. It used to be $34 for it (not happy hour) and now it's $10 more! The worst part about this is the fact that my filet tasted nothing like a filet mignon! If anything, it tasted like carne asada. The meat wasn't cooked medium well (what I ordered), it was completely well-done. I don't know what the hell is up with this \"butterfly cook method\" but no. Never again. The meat was not tender at all, usually it \"melts\" in my mouth, and it wasn't thick or rounded like how a filet mignon is supposed to look. Maybe it wasn't even a filet mignon, even though the bill said it was. Also, not impressed with the service or that techno/electronic music shit like every other restaurant in Vegas.

While unassuming outside, from the moment we walked in I felt like I'd been transported to a 1920's speakeasy. The red velvet wallpaper, the black leather seats, and the chain chandeliers set a fantastic mood.\n\nAllie, our server, was very knowledgeable about the extensive cocktail menu and had great suggestions for us. She was fun and friendly through our long meal and I feel lucky we had her as a server. She was the proverbial cherry on top of our delicious meal. \n\nThe biggest draw for Herbs & Rye is their half-price steak happy hour and I see why. You receive your steak and one side at a very reasonable price point. My fiance got his first filet mignon ever with no sauce (because why cover up a great steak) and I ordered the NY strip with the brandy peppercorn sauce. The meat on both cuts was extremely tender; the filet was melt-in-your-mouth soft. Both had a great crust on them with a nice, rare center. The truffle mac and cheese was fantastic as well; my fiance chowed down on the roasted garlic pieces on top of his mashed potatoes. \n \nThe drinks run between $11-12, which is extremely reasonable, both for Vegas and for the quality of cocktail. I have never found a Ramos Gin Fizz for under $15 in any city, so I was excited to get such a complex drink for a good price. I also recommend the blackthorne; I've never had pineapple gomme before, but I want to put it in all my drinks now. \n\nMoral of the story: go here. Go here for drinks with your friends, go here on a nice date with your SO, go here by yourself to pig out on delicious steak. My only regret about Herbs & Rye is that it's not located in my hometown. Amazing place."

My steak was good but my spinach was uneatable..no exaggeration, they were THE SALTIEST thing I've eaten my entire life..I think they might have accidently dumped salt in them. I told our waitress and got brussel sprouts instead, they were too charred and dripping w grease. His food was fine, steak was good and lobster was so so, potatoes were good. I must admit the broccoli he substituted was DELICIOUS!! I would recommend the broccoli here but that's really about it.\n\nAll in all:\nService - our waitress was polite and nice, she was great!\n\nFood - pretty terrible, they messed up very simple stuff\n\nPrice - in comparison to the atmosphere and the food, definitely not worth it! You can get a better meal at another steak house that has a much better ambience and much livelier. Honestly though, im a foodie and if the food is great I'll go anywhere and this just wasn't. \n\nAtmosphere - small, not very lively. Nothing interesting."

The decor is gorgeous and the dining room is much smaller than I expected but really nice. Our server was friendly and helpful. I had the linguine and some sweet potato tots. The tots were great and not too sweet. The pasta was a little too spicy and soupy for my taste (the chili flakes were dispersing in the broth). My friend and I shared the cookie for dessert. It was nice and hot and cake with ice cream; delicious. All in all, dinner was nice, liked everything but my entree. Nice place for a date night or private event."

Upon arriving we had some issues, we actually didn't get in until an hour after our reservation time.  Having a hangry group of 11, we started to get a bit fussy.  They sent shots on the house outside where we were waiting as well as some bread baskets which made us much happier and made the trips inside one by one to complain go away.  Once seated, we had a wonderful waitress [really wish I got her name!].  I don't believe we're the easiest group to deal with honestly and she kept a smile on her face the entire time!  Appetizers we got some shrimp cocktail which was delicious, also an order of wings that came out cold but we were so hungry we didn't seem to care.  Everyone at the table got steak and had good things to say about it other than a few complaints about the way their meats were cooked.  I personally am not much of a steak person but I tried my fiance's and it was delicious!  I got the chicken breast on angel hair pasta and it was fantastic!  Their extensive cocktail list was pretty awesome too!  I tried a few from the table and they were all yummy.  I'll definitely be back."

The first time I went I had a great experience and my bf had a horrible one (read previous review) However, I talked him into going back and since we've returned 3 more times! We always go for happy hour between midnight and 3am. After trying 3 different steaks my favorite is the Bone in Kansas City cooked medium well add herbs and rye rub. I've had the blue cheese crust and the mushrooms and onions toppers. Both are yummy but they don't top the rub. Another highlight is the chicken wings. They are so different from any wings I have ever tried. I also had a chopped salad that was a meal in itself. I don't know what it is but every time I go here, I eat every single bite of everything. Appetizer, salads, sides, desserts (get the donuts) EVERYTHING! \nThe mixology is one of a kind. Whether you choose one of the old school vivations, or a simple cran & vodka- its made special every time. They truly aim to please. So ignore the fact that this place looks like a hole in the wall bar, because once you walk thru those doors you are in a whole new time. A classy, enjoyable one."

The drinks definitely have bigger placement on the menu however the food is simple and amazing. \n\nWe started off with a Mary Pinkerton (drink) which was fruity and frothy. It opened up my taste buds for an amazing flat bread covered with sausage. The flat bread was great with the perfect amount of seasoning. I had the Kansas City bone in for dinner with the truffle Mac and cheese. My steak was accompanied by the house rub which was almost like an ancho chili paste spice rub. It was delightful and my steak was cooked to perfection. The Mac and cheese was good but lacked some seasoning. My dinner party ordered the strip steak and asparagus, jalape\u00f1o creamed corn and sweet potato Tots, all of which were enjoyable. \n\nDessert was THE BEST PART! \nThe donuts were absurdly perfect! Covered in sugar with a soft chewy dough! I of course covered mine in chocolate ganache!

I wish I remembered the specific drinks - every single thing we ordered was not only inventive, but very well balanced (which is the #1 thing I look for in a cocktail).  Their cocktail menu takes you on a delicious tour through the many eras of booze.\n\nWe ordered the beef tartare: it was excellent!  I'm super picky about beef tartare, and this one was delicious and had a great presentation as well.  We also ordered the filet and some asparagus.  Of which, we ate every last bite.

The wait staff are phenomenal, and I love the dark speakeasy vibe (red velvet wallpaper, black booths, and swanky chandeliers).  I've rarely seen it crowded, which actually kind of worries me because I wonder how it stays in business!\n\nThey have some steakhouse style food, but what I go for are the fantastic creative (old school style) drinks and service.  The \"classic cocktails\" are amazing, and the service is personal and helpful.  There are a few drinks that dabble with absinthe, so if you're a fan of the licoricey liquor, here's a place to try it.  My favorite drink is the Aviator - which from my memory is a combo of gin, lime, and a violet infused liquor - oh my!  They also serve classics like \"Moscow Mule\" and will likely make anything you request.\n\nThe happy hour deal is fantastic, with some of the steaks (half price).  My friend labelled it as one of the best steaks he's ever had.  I have tried a few of the flatbread pizzas, which are a fair deal at $10 a piece.  We tried the linguine and clams, which was good but not the best I've ever had.\n\nFor a cool off-strip vibe with great cocktails and an atmosphere where you can chat with your friends (i.e. not blasting boom-boom music), or sit at the bar on your own, check this place out!"

The service here is HORRENDOUS! It takes about 30 minutes to receive a cocktail and you should probably look at the menu before you go and order as soon as the waiter takes your drink order because you won't see them for about another 25 minutes. The one instance that really irritated me was my boyfriend and I arrived around 5pm for happy hour, and the place was empty. We were the first guests to sit in the bar area. The server came right over, took our drink order and we didnt see him again until 30 minutes later! More tables started to arrive and he went to take care of each of them instead of returning to us to deliver our drinks or take our order. We sat and watched the server take 3 orders from other tables before even coming back to us. At this point we had already been at the restaurant for about 45 minutes with no drink and no order placed. Now being in the service industry myself, I understand it gets busy and you get behind but to at least acknowledge a table that has been waiting for a long time is all I ask for. The server finally came over to take our order and we politely reminded him we still had not received the tea and coke we ordered. Was not even apologetic or anything, just took our order and returned with the drinks. The food came out in a timely manner and was delicious as always. He checked on us maybe one time and it took us another 25 minutes after we were done eating to get the check and pay. It was an ordeal just to enjoy a dinner with my boyfriend.\n     I seriously have given this place three other chances since then to change my mind and it has failed each time. The service gets worse every single time I went and its like the servers don't even care. The happy hour is great and the food is to die for, but I hate being neglected as a paying and tipping customer. Ive come at all different times, not just during happy hour and its still awful. It saddens me to even write this because this is the only place in Vegas that knows how to cook a steak properly."

My husband and I went for a nice evening out during their Happy Hour from 5-8 PM, when steaks are half price. Reservation requested \"quiet table.\" Seated in the corner, so far, so good, 2 minutes later they seat a group of 10 guys on a boys night out/business dinner right next to us. I asked to be moved but they had nothing that was any better. The place is very loud and you can barely hear yourself think. Server was cordial, but busboy delivered warm bread to every other table around us, including the one next to us before us and by the time we got our bread, the meal was already delivered. We both ordered the ribeye and mine was to have sauteed mushrooms and onions topper. My husband's steak was average and mine was so marbled that there was a glaze of fat on my plate that shined in the dim lighting. Mushroom and onion topper was primarily onions. Apparently, they do not believe in seasoning the steak as it was bland. The server did not offer to send it back for another one, just brought me the salt and pepper shaker, no fresh cracked available. Only saving grace was the Truffle Mac and Cheese which was delicious, but I have no idea why \"truffle\" was in the name as I could not detect anything truffle related. Cocktail was good. Bar was packed with younger crowd. Place only has 1 bathroom for both sexes and had a very long line. Price was good but I had the impression from the server that they were doing us a favor by allowing us to purchase a $54.00 steak for $27. Dinner out was still $100 and I left there unimpressed."

Unfortunately, we were a party of 10, so had to pull a sleazy move that I'm not proud of to cut a few folks out. This place is a short drive off the strip, but traffic around 5pm is hell in Vegas. The hostess was understanding (thank you!) and we were seated as soon as we arrived. \n\nAs other yelp-ers have told you, the happy hour deal on steaks is smoking and available on Saturdays, too. I don't eat much meat and wouldn't pay full price for the NY strip I ordered, but for $21 definitely can't complain. It comes with one side- I chose the spinach which was good, but again, glad I didn't have to pay $8 for the small dish. B ordered the steak fries which were perfect- hot, not greasy, crisp on the outside and soft inside. The large Caesar salad with an unmemorable dressing had plenty of lettuce, but was missing the promised anchovies. \n\nBut let's be honest, the real reason to come here is the cocktails. The menu is all classics. I ordered the Ford cocktail (wanted to try something new) and a last word (because that's what I had been craving. Both well-balanced and lovely. Our server, Jeremy, was great. He shared some of the history of the place and highlights of their most recent accolades. He was patient answering questions about the drink list and didn't rush to clear us out even though I'm sure the tables are in high-demand on a Friday night during HH. \n\nI would definitely return, though will stick to drinks and sit in the bar where you get to see the bartenders in action."

Reminded me of an old school vegas type of spot where you might find some gangsters having dinner and drinks in the back corner. Even though the place was packed I was able to snag two seats at the bar pretty quickly. The drinks were great.  I had a Moscow Mule and some other specialty drink that I don't quite remember the name of.  For dinner we had salads which were both delicious. The bread was really good too. Happy hour specials were good but the food is a little on the high end so prepare to spend about $30 on a steak even if it's half off during happy hour.  The portion sizes are large but I'd like to see some smaller portions at more reasonable prices. The staff was entertaining and accomodating. The only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the entree costs. If you're looking for a dark,  loud,  trendy spot with lots of action this is it.  If you want something quaint and quiet go elsewhere."

At times, it almost seems like a school for young up-and-coming cocktail artists, marshaled by the seasoned head bartender.\n\nThe cocktail menu is refreshing in its focus on classic and prohibition era cocktails, but if you are in the mood for something more modern or unique, the bartender will mix you up something fancy and catering to your specific tastes.\n\nThe atmosphere is very calm and cozy, a great place to relax after dinner or to recover from a taxing experience in a more 'energetic' bar.  The music I can't quite remember, but I'd like to say it was Jazz.  All I do remember is that it was great background music for a conversation.\n\nI hope the word spreads more for this spot, they deserve a place in the Las Vegas local's scene."

The bartenders were exceptional and the food was very good for the half off, Happy Hour price, but not wroth the actual price.  The bar was a 5 star no doubt, while the food was 4 stars.\n\nI ordered 3 separate drinks while dining at Herbs & Rye.  Each time I asked for a certain type of alcohol and they surprised me with a delicious concoction.  The menu is extensive by itself, but I always love getting unique, unknown drinks from great bartenders when possible.  Trust me, the drinks are top notch, but on par with strip prices ($12).\n\nThe food was very solid as well.  I had the rib eye and a side of brussel sprouts.  Since it was Happy Hour the steak was half off, but I don't think it was worth the full asking price of $40+.  If it wasn't for the great half off prices for my steak, I think I would have rated the meal portion of my visit lower.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my dinner very much.  For a cocktail, this is the place to go.  The bqrtenders are friendly, knowledgable, and on top of their mix drink game.  The food was solid at Happy Hour prices (5-8pm), but a bit high for a regular night out on the town compared to similar Vegas strip steak restaurants.  Herbs & Rye is close enough to the strip to warrant a trip.  I definitely recommend a visit."

They have  happy hour where some of the things on the menu were half off including the 18 ounce ribeye which was phenomenal!!  Sides are ala carte. We had the mushrooms, truffle Mac n cheese,garlic spinach, garlic potatoes, broccoli and cheese, 3 different deserts and several appetizers. Everything was to die for!!

I couldn't really tell because the lighting was really dark, but the next I'm completely sick!!! I have never had to actually order the TEMP of pork before! If someone does not want it well done they say so! But the only reason I'm suffering right now is because I gave them the benefit of the doubt and believed in the cooks!\n\nIF YOU ORDER THE PORK MAKE SURE YOU TELL THEM A TEMP TO!! because apparently it's a new thing to cook them medium RARE!! \n\nMy boyfriend got the strip steak which he order rare and was perfectly cooked!\nMy girl friend got the salmon. I tried as well it was delicious.\nThey both loved the mash potatoes!\n\nFor dessert, they had home-made doughnuts with two different sauces, a white coconut and a delicious buttery caramel. Me and my girl friend over stuffed our faces with dessert!\n\n\"I could of skipped dinner and just had that dessert!\" - we all said.\n\n\nThe alcohol selection was fantastic! I've tried scotch for the first time. I don't prefer it, but it was so cool, the one mix drink they have with scotch, they hold an orange peel over the alcohol and light the top on fire. SUPER cool.\n\nThe atmosphere was beautiful, the lighting kept changing in the middle of our dinner, which was weird. \n\nMy girl friend that took me loves this place for the scotch, it's not my scene, but for someone that likes really good aged alcohol will love this place."

All the cocktails are organized by time period adding character to the menu, and to be honest, you can't go wrong with anything on the cocktail menu. The best time to go is happy hour from midnight to close where steaks and other items are half off. Go for the steaks. Every steak I've ordered is cooked PERFECTLY! Some of the best steaks I've had have come from Herbs & Rye and they don't even consider themselves a steakhouse. This is my go to place when I'm looking for a classier place with great food and drinks. Herbs & Rye is a Vegas gem."

We drink these every night... no, seriously, EVERY night, which means that we've had Old Fashioned at cocktail bars all over the country. We're a tough crowd and we'd probably rank this a 7.5. Good, good stuff. I had an excellent cocktail but, of course, forgot the name. We got the bisteca flatbread and some fries to share. Fries: Good. Flatbread: Very good. \nService was friendly, prompt, and helpful. We are at the bar and the bartenders took good care of us, even throwing a couple of drinks our way when the entire bar was toasting a birthday girl, and we were the odd men out. How cool! \nWe did have some trouble with the bill, which took a couple iterations to get right, but they were very sweet, apologetic, and accommodating. Nobody's perfect and, quite frankly, I dealt with something similar at another establishment earlier that day, which was not dealt with with nearly the same humility and helpfulness--so I was happy and charmed. \nIn all, we really had a great night. The best part, really, was the warmth of the whole staff. My husband's family lives on the same side of town, and we are frequently looking for a late-night joint to escape to after his folks go to bed. This place definitely tops the list. We can't wait to come back.  The cocktail list looks like a blast and I'm looking forward to many joyful samplings."

Trust me, every other time I'm in that place, you won't see their servers for a while because their running around like chickens with their heads cut off. I ain't gonna lie, it makes me mad in the beginning waiting for our food and drinks but once you take a bite of their steaks you just zone the hell out and forget everything bad that just happened.\n\nYeah it's that good, I work in the hospitality industry too and service is one of the things I look for while dining out at other places. \n\nHappy Hour is 5pm - 8pm and 12am - 3am everyday with the exception of Sundays (closed)\n\n50% off all steaks, and a few apps.\n\nWeapon of Choice: 14 oz NY strip, medium rare, with a side of peruvian chimichurri and creamed corn. This ain't your graveyard casino $3.99 steak and eggs NY strip, I honestly don't know how they get the NY strip so damn tender.

My buds had 4 french beers between them and calamari.  \n\nOverall the bill for 1 glass of wine, 4 beers, calamari + 1 flat bread was $70 tip not included in calculation which is a little steep, but I thought it was worth it because the aesthetics made it feel like it was worth spending the extra green.

If you want to try something different get the Russian Mule.  Its a citrus tasting drink with vodka and ginger beer served in a brass mug with crushed ice.  I tried one for the first time and it instantly became a favorite.    \n\nCheck this place out if you are on that side of town which is central Las Vegas, not too far from the strip.

Parking is terrible (in an alley) and despite only having to wait 20 minutes for a table, it took over an hour from the time of ordering to get our food. When it finally did come, it was wrong (added a spicy rub that wasn't asked for). I didn't send it back because I didn't want to wait another hour for my steak. When I was finally able to catch up with the waiter, he said he had put my order in correctly and I must have gotten someone else's steak. Upon getting the bill, (which also took way longer than it should have) nothing \"adjusted\" to acknowledge the mistake and poor service. Food was decent, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back."

But I got really lucky and got to see some chica's ass as she climbed up a bar stool like she was Stallone in Cliffhanger allowing her short skirt to ride up lol. \nThe steaks were great, ordered the ribeye with a blue cheese crown, and the filet.  Each come with a side to which we got the mashed potatoes, and jalape\u00f1o corn, also added the truffle mac (you know).  All the sides were a lil.... Eh.  Mashed:  we're they suppose to be garlic mashed cuz they almost had no garlic in em... Corn wasn't creamy enough and truffle Mac was bland n dry. Sides need work.  Oh but the calamari was on point! Great flavors on that dish.  Finished off with the donuts and hey, how can you go wrong with donuts.  I'd go back for sure but only during the happy hours.

I expected the majority of the menu to be 50% off and that wasn't the case.  The things I wanted, Bruschetta and Calamari, were not 50% off but I got them anyway.  And I'm glad I did.  Both great and far better than I expected from bar food.  The service was really great too.  We met the owner while we were here, and he seemed like a cool dude.

When I finally got the chance, we ended up having plans to go twice in the same week! If my rating was based solely on service they would've got a 1.5, based on drinks 4.5, based on food 3.\nMy first time there we were with a very large group ( 30+ people) on a Tuesday night at 8pm. It's not like they didn't know we were coming, but they seemed overwhelmed. They couldn't keep up with our drink orders, it took way too long to get the orders in let alone get the drink (even if it was just bourbon on the rocks). It took a long time to get our food as well, some people in our group were done and leaving when we didn't even get our food yet. They ran out of sides. Brought out sides way before our entree so the side was cold. Steaks were overdone. My lobster tail was over cooked. The food was just  \"meh\". We were all happy with the drink selection and drinks...when we got them.\nI was turned off with that first try, but I gave them a pass since it was such a large group. And went back with some friends on Friday night around 7:30. Again, service was horrible. It took forever to get our drink orders, and it was nearly impossible to get the waiters attention if you wanted anything else. Once we ordered food, the food also took forever. I got the Calamari this time and the first time and it was good both times. I also got a Prosciutto and Asparagus Flatbread, it was good, nothing exciting, but good. My husbands steak was much better this time and his side, Broccoli and Cheese was yummy. A friend at our table never got his food when we were all done eating, so he cancelled his order. My drinks were perfect (order 2 drinks at a time because they take so long to get!) Brown Derby and Blinker, both good in their own way. It was our friends birthday so we all split some Donuts....they were awesome.\nI like the decor and old fashioned vibe. I've been to this locale before it was Herbs And Rye...boy has it changed! \nThe service alone would keep me from going back, not sure if I will go back. Only time will tell. Good thing they have some loyal Yelpers as patrons because they turned off a room full of people."

Now, they're each non-happy-hour-priced at around $13/ea, and the only happy hour appys are the mussels and the clam linguine. So much for the good ol' days. Not so happy hour.

The decor inside is pretty amazing...I don't even know how to describe it.  Dark, gothic, speakeasy?  I don't know but whatever it is works great.  My friend and I came in here one evening at about 9:30 for a late dinner after work.  The lot is always full when I drive by; partly due to being somewhat small and partly because it seems everyone besides me knows how great this place is.  For this first visit I had one of their micro brew drafts (can't even remember the name); it was dark similar to Newcastle but better.  I also had one of their flatbreads and a house salad.  I try to keep it simple when going to new place so that I'm not disappointed (read: pissed) if I order something crazy and expensive and it turns out to be disappointing.  The food lived up to its reputation...everything tasted great, was fresh and presented nicely.  Service wasn't too shabby either however I did notice the bartender spending more time chatting with the hostess's than the guests...can't say I blame him, they were easy on the eyes but just saying people do notice this and can be off-putting to some.

Designed in a style somewhere between \"Old time Vegas\" and stripped-down speakeasy with a less-than-ideal location on West Sahara it was with eyes still adjusting from the 6pm sun that I entered the small tavern and greeted at a small podium by the woman later to be my waitress I was quickly led to my choice of tables, a menu soon in hand presenting tough decisions with a resultant four item order divided into two courses accompanied by one of nearly a dozen gin based cocktails I'd have liked to try were my liver's capacity on par with that of my gut.  Obviously a space prone to becoming lively as the night wears on but only perhaps half-full during the course of my meal it was after perhaps a ten minute wait that my cocktail arrived and featuring a lovely balance of fruit juxtaposing juniper notes beneath a cloudy of foam the Clover Club was a hit, the flavor profile particularly refreshing when matched to a rich opening duo of tender macaroni unfortunately overwhelmed with truffle oil and a crisp, lightly charred flatbread that fared far better with briny bacon finding its foil in the tang of cr\u00e8me fraiche.   At this point debating an Aviation versus the Bee's Knees it was a bit to my surprise that my second round arrived immediately on the heels of my first and forgetting the second cocktail as it was likely to arrive far too late to be enjoyed with the food I instead dug straight in, the 12oz bone-in piece of pork seared perfectly and coated with bleu over hand-smashed potatoes amidst a jus of pork and poached figs, the later laying split alongside the protein and still intensely sweet...though certainly not as much so as a bowl of tender tots bathed in a pool of honey beneath snowcaps of toasted marshmallow that ranks amongst the best \"sides\" I've had this year.  At this point sated but happy to go another round it was to an oral explanation of the restaurant's desserts that I was finally treated and although large sharing portions of sugared doughnuts and a skillet cookie were hard to resist it was instead in the day's special that I partook, the piping hot chunk of booze-soaked baguette crowned by a ball of vanilla ice cream proving very 'special' indeed with butter and cinnamon bubbling at its base as if the kitchen had known I was coming and prepared it just for me."

Such a big part of a great dining experience to me. All the servers we've had have always been super nice and extremely helpful with any questions and offering up suggestions. \n\nWe always get a few different cocktails (even though they aren't included in the happy hour specials). We like our drinks on the sweeter side, so some of our favorites are the Zombie, Harvey Wallbanger, Painkiller, and Mark Pickford. On occasion, when we're feeling adventurous, we'll go for the Bartender's Choice. \n\nFor food, the Wedge Salad is always our favorite way to start. It never disappoints. And my SO always goes for the NY strip and I get the filet, topped with onions and mushrooms. For sides, the garlic mash is always solid and the sweet potato tots are good too. The steaks have always been cooked perfectly to our liking and are tender and flavorful. They offer lots of add-on options for the steaks as well.\n\nThe only negative is that it is a bit pricey when not dining during happy hour.

Food was good but steak was doused in oil from mushroom & onions, otherwise as good as always. Service just sucked! We had more interaction and service from bus boy (awesome should get server status) and hostess! Sorry for bad review but when things are bad ya gotta say something. Best part.... Server never even acknowledged the slow service or anything, someone give that bus boy a raise! Full price on the check too! Boo herbs & rye tonight!"

Well, it was just me. \n\nWe were greeted promptly and sat on a semi-circle. It was an awkward setting for us two. it seriously felt like a date.\n\nShared a plate of Carpaccio (beef, arugula, balsamic). Mmmm-mmmm-mmm. At first, I couldn't find the meat, I thought it was just a plate of arugula. But because of the dim lighting, it was really there, under the arugulas. But my oh my, delish and refreshing.  It was a hint of bitterness, sweetness and saltiness. All my senses were confused in the right way.\n\nAs for drinks we got two...can't remember exactly what the names were mine was Scowoff? Scawhoff? S something. Even our server corrected me. My buddy got the drink with that comes with fire. Anyway, my drink was like a manhattan but with lemony goodness. \n\nGosh, I wasn't even drunk but it sounds like I was based on this review. Haha. I would come back here to see what the happy hour is all about. Maybe have a plate of meat for me or clams."

This is a little off the beaten path, so if you are a tourist visiting, not only is it difficult to find, but a little tough to allow for the time away from the strip and everything else Vegas has to offer. Came here during NADA this year and was pleasantly surprised that my group of 8 was able to walk in, without reservations and enjoy a fantastic meal. We all ended up sharing things from steak to pasta to chicken. I also introduced a coworker to absinthe. They make it traditionally, so you get a show with the cocktail as well. Everything is so well done here, from the food to the drinks to the meticulously decorated interior. I absolutely love Herbs & Rye!"

Also, it is a great place to bring your family because they have lots of seating and kid friendly. They also have a private area if you want to throw a party.

For the main course we had the sirloin (they recommended the rib-eye but had ran out by then) and the fettucini \"crabonara\". We didn't feel rushed and the food came out perfect.\n\nDefinitely coming back here again to try everything else.

Perfectly thin slices covered in a truffle mayo drizzle on a bed of arugula, sign me up!! \nThen I drank a Moscow Mule, the most perfect summer cocktail ever, and the glass it comes in is kind of cool too. I also had the Hemingway daiquiri, also very good but I must say the Mule was my favorite.  \nThe tv's behind the bar were playing TCM's (and 16 candles was on) and the History channel, very entertaining to watch while sipping on some drinks.

Hidden costs abound or are written in fine print in the menu which are difficult to read in the dimmed- light atmosphere. For instance, if you split a meal with someone, Herbs and Rye will hand you an empty plate to divide your servings and then add on a $7.00 charge for this extra plate. They also charge a 20 percent gratuity- which includes the tax - and is based on the full price of the meal and not the \"happy hour\" prices. The steak is merely ok, the drink servings are small. Seriously, why bother? It's Vegas and truly great places abound with no hidden surprises in your bill and fabulous food and drinks. I'll take Del Friscos or Hank's any day!"

But while Herbs & Rye touts itself as a steakhouse, you might want to pass on their cuts. \n\nFor the past year, I've been hearing great things about this local Vegas favorite. Styled after the Prohibition era, this dimly-lit Italian speakeasy offers some great seafood pasta, flatbreads, and drinks. They're also the only place I've ever eaten at that offers happy hour for their steaks. Unfortunately, the New York strip that I ordered was overseasoned and underwhelming. However, at half the retail price of $42, I couldn't complain too much. If you're struggling to decide on a side, get the truffle mac & cheese, which was beyond cheesy. \n\nFor appetizers, the beef tartar was amazing. I also highly recommend the linguine & clams. The white wine and garlic sauce was superb. I usually try not to eat too much bread, but I couldn't resist dipping it in the sauce. And of course, the comprehensive list of cocktails was impressive. Organized by era, it features plenty of classics that will be sure to bring you back to the days of the Rat Pack. Service was great. Our waitress was able to squeeze in a few latecomers' orders to include the happy hour price. Happy hour runs from 5:00-8:00 pm so be sure drop in."

I'm from Missouri and it's hard to find a good steak on the west coast. Make sure to go during happy hour. Great time except the service was super slow. I ordered a glass a wine and waited about 15 minutes for it. The bar was not that busy either. I will be coming back :)"

            "review": "So it was a night of culinary adventures last Friday and I finally got time to yelp about it. It started off at Herbs and Rye, which I have driven past umpteenthousand times without even noticing. The inside is very swanky, almost a Rat-Pack feel, as if Sinatra should come out of the other room telling you to scram, you're in his seat. It's the kind of place where the booze is cold and the broads are hot. (Wow, I've been waiting FOREVER to use that line in conversation.)\n\nThe food was good. Maybe I was just looking at a bar menu, but the selection seemed to be kind of small. It seemed to be like: Appetizer, Flatbread Pizza, Big Fat Steak, the end. But I ordered the hot wings, which were satisfactorily spicy. I tried some of my friend's sweet potato tater tots, but wasn't sold on them.\n\nBut the drinks... oooh lordie. If you have more than two, be prepared to have a designated driver. I ordered a Long Beach Iced Tea, which when made right should have a subtle red/fuschia color to it. Too dark means it's a weak drink; too light means too much alcohol.\n\nThe drink came back and looked less like a cocktail and more like a serving of pink lemonade Crystal Light.\n\nNeedless to say, I only ordered one.\n\nI'm not knocking the place. If I was invited back by friends, I'd certainly go. But for such a good first impression, it kind of fizzled out."

My friend got a Moscow mule and the ribeye medium with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. My husband got the ribeye medium rare with a side of truffle Mac n' cheese and I got the filet mignon with the brussels sprouts. My food was great! Loved the Brussels sprouts especially. The filet mignon was like butter. My friends ribeye was great, it was well season and cooked perfectly. Her mash potatoes were good too. My husband's truffle Mac n cheese was probably one of the better Mac n cheese we've ever had. His steak was ok. It had a giant silverskin running through it. He ate around it so it wasn't that bad lol. We also got the donuts for dessert and they were amazing! Really great deal if you come for the happy hour and the service was great as well."

            "review": "A previous reviewer's characterization of Herbs & Rye as \"old style mixology\" is wholly accurate. Seek out this local gem for the drinks, whether at the bar or in the dinning room. If you visit the latter, you will have the opportunity to peruse their historically inspired drink menu, which includes anecdotes and legends all the way back to the 1800s. This is a place you should feel entirely comfortable ordering the \"Bartender's Choice,\" a beverage custom selected and mixed to your personality. Our waiter was discerning enough to recognize that my girlfriend did not have the fruity pallette of the usual Ladies' Night patron and brought her a proper whiskey drink.\nAppropriately,  the hospitality matches the mixology, fostering an incredibly welcoming and appreciative atmosphere. Our waiter Christian, who some keen locals might recognize from Makers and Finders, not only remembered me from the coffee shop, but took extra care to present my girlfriend and I some of his favorite samples from both the drink and dinner menu.\nLet us not forget that Herbs & Rye is also a steakhouse. In the classically inspired environment with speakeasy decor, you will find your traditional, hearty butcher cuts even more savery. \nHerbs & Rye is a great place for locals to become regulars. When your friends visit to experience the Boulevard, keep this in your back pocket for a surprise, after they have exhausted themselves with our city's signature extravagance and request something unassuming, delectable, and welcoming."

            "review": "Following a rather busy Saturday, a small contingent of us managed to get a late dinner in.  I only heard good hollers about this joint so took a detour from the Commonwealth (still never been to yet) to give them a try since the couple we was with lives deep in Hendo.\n\nFrom the outside, the place looks like a dive bar or possibly even strip club or swinger bar appearance, with no windows or accents other than a well lit sign.  There is parking around the building and the place can be found on the south side of Sahara.\n\nUpon entrance, I immediately dug the atmosphere.  Very dim lighting for those scared of the dark, lol.  It is deceivingly spacious inside and well designed in several sections for dining and the more bustling bar area.  \n\nThere was a pretty sick DJ in there spinning hits with the accompanying music videos to match.  Unfortunately, we were seated in a four person booth that was directly under on of the speaker monitors, making it extremely hard to communicate.  We resorted to sign language and drunken facial features before long.  \n\nThere is a vast menu of custom cocktails and saison beers.  Nothing extravagant, but offers a little more than your mainstream domestics and imports.  They brew their own beer as well but went with Chimay (red label) and recommended it to my buddy who is not accustomed to Trappist beer.  The ladies went with some cocktail that was a bit sour for my taste and probably explains why I didn't get its name.  \n\nFor dinner, there is two happy hours, one in the early evening and a reverse happy hour later at midnight.  All items with a star next to it are half off, considering some of the steaks range from average prices up to $160+.  My homie went with a New York steak, his lady the clam linguine, and I shared a medium rare rib eye with my girl.  Steaks are aged and grilled well.  Defiantly good cuts.  We got there about 11 and killed some time with the carpaccio, calamari and shrimp cocktail until happy hour hit.  Oh yeah the mac and cheese was on point as well.  Not nearly as good as DW Bistro though.\n\nThe decor is hip and trendy.  The bar was packed and this place seems to cater to a nice variety of heads.  A boat load of friends drove in from Cali on a whim and met over here before hitting up Spearmint Rhino for one of the girl's barfday.  It got a bit busier then and they were in the secluded section all on their own, and sadly, was not pleased with the waitresses neglect to them like some orphans with B.O.  (poor things).\n\nThe overall experience was great and can see ourselves coming by in the future, either to pre funk before a headliner venue, or just to get a late bite to eat.  The place is a hit and was highly recommended from my co dub and another couple.\n\nOh yeah, since the place is about rye's, don't forget to get the Sazerac...after a few, I dubbed it the commissioner sazerac (sic) instead of Sisolak...go figure."

There is no doubt it's more of a hipster joint, than a vintage Vegas place, but other than a DJ playing the current hits, you'd have thought you'd have entered a time warp with the old school cocktails. \n\nIt's cool to see a fully stocked bar with a copper black splash and an Absinthe fountain.  The drinks were from another era.  Old recipes going back to the early late 1800's to the early 20th Century.  \n\nWe had the meatballs and though they were commercially prepared they were quite tasty as was the flat-bread pizza that we shared.\n\nOverall a real hit and a nice way to share some good food, pleasant atmosphere and some old time specialties."

Strangely enough, they are in the same building, so good luck getting the good one if you go there.\n\nEverything from the ambiance to the service to the quality of the drinks was poor the night we went there.  Supposedly that is not the typical experience; so I may try it out again....\n\nProblem 1: the bar booth tables have no leg space, so 4 of us were uncomfortable in a booth that appeared to be quite large.\n\nProblem 2: the service was terrible.  The waiter took our drink order, and came back 15 minutes later to take a second drink order for our friends.  I inquired about where our drinks were and he then realized he never put in our drink order.  When we finally got drinks (25 minutes after ordering in a very empty bar), he spilled half of my friend's drink and one of the other drinks was only about 2/3 full.  (He did not offer to bring her a new one.)\n\nProblem 3: The drinks did not taste very good.  They were OK, but not the awesome deliciousness that I was expecting.  Also, there are no prices on the drink menu, and there are wild rumors flying about town that drinks cost $20-30 each.  (They do not, they were all $9, which was the only reason I was not totally angry).\n\nI've had similar cocktails at other mixology establishments that were much better... just more balanced.  These all seemed to have one taste (bitter, sweet) that overwhelmed the rest of the drink, which I think should be a more subtle combination of flavors that enhance one another, not clash for dominance.\n\nProblem 4: The place has a lot of potential ambiance, but at some point they just cranked up the top 40 radio, which is not very \"speakeasy.\"\n\nThe only food we ordered was the (vegan! yay!) sweet potato tots.  I really liked these, and that's why this place is getting two stars instead of one.  That and b/c the drinks were only $9."

I had to spit them out in the bathroom to avoid food poisoning. The mashed potatoes served with the over priced surf & turf had to be instant! Although I can't be positive about the mashed potatoes, the texture and flavor definitely tasted like it. There is no outdoor smoking area, you can't take your drinks outside (laws and all). The dinning area was claustrophobic and they wouldn't split the check (understandable, but still annoying). Overall, not the best experience. My suggestion, if you're someone who prefers quality over quantity (cheap happy hour), this is not the spot for you. Save your money. Go somewhere with more integrity. Somewhere that doesn't insult the intelligence of its patrons. Really? Instant mashed potatoes with surf & turf. Tacky."

And the Filet was not up to par and was cold when it got to the table. So BYE~!"

The atmosphere is very dark and kind of like what I would picture a vampire bar to consist of. I had the flat iron steak which was said to be 8oz but it looked much larger than that. The asparagus was cooked just right, not too soft and not too firm. The garlic mash was creamy and flavorful. I had the spicy mussels as an appetizer and they were a great way to start. I don't necessarily like gin but their gin cocktails were tart and sweet at the same time and I enjoyed them."

Walking in looks cozy burgundy wallpaper, brick, and dim lighting. We were first asked if we are over 21 years old. We were sat at a booth alongside the bar.  Candle centerpiece.  Black napkin wrapped utensils on side plates.  Large steakhouse style menu. An old western in black and white playing on the tv. The server had pretty hair and makeup styled that went with the theme.  Merlot for me, Napa Pinot noir for him.  Although we didn't order cocktails, I appreciated the art in the bartenders craft. Working in nightlife I am so accustomed to the quick pour of drinks. This was a nice change of pace. His napkin didn't appear like it was washed thoroughly.  The server quickly replaced it. She suggested the beef carpaccio and penne.  So we chose the carpaccio over the clams we had originally picked out.  He ordered rib eye with spinach on the side.  The carpaccio came out quickly. Arugula tossed with truffle oil atop the meat, drizzled with balsamic vinegar and capers. Very fresh and delicious. Large serving but not filling when shared between the two of us. The steak!  Mmm the steak...  Ribeye. Nicely seasoned. Cooked to perfection.  Juicy and tender. I love fat, so ribeye is one of my favorite cuts.  This place did it justice. My bf of course asked for A1. It was served in a sauce cup. The spinach side was a bit small so we ordered the little neck clams. When they arrived the server spilled the sauce on the table and my boyfriends hand.  Probably because the plate was hot. She apologized but did not wipe it up and picked up some empty plates instead.  The clams were nice and small the sauce a little creamy and you can taste the herbs. The bread it came with for dipping was nice and sour, soft in the middle. My boyfriend waited a while for a refill on his wine.  Another server ended up coming by and asked if he needed another. A few moments later our server came to check up.  My bf asked for extra napkins to clean the spill from earlier and that was when she wiped it up. By then our clams were done. Shortly after his wine arrived from the other server.  Minutes after we were informed it was now happy hour.  (Clams and wine are happy hour) Unfortunately, we waited to get them minutes before happy hour started.  The desserts were offered verbally. Baked cookie topped with ice cream or sugar donuts. The photos on yelp led is to donuts. Ohh my... 10 mini donuts with donut holes.  Soft and warm with the crunch of sugar. Caramel and white chocolate for dipping. We ate every bite of our meal but 2 clams.  No to go box? Rare occasion for us. The food alone would have gotten 5 stars from me.  The bill came out to $158 before tip.  Really excited that this is a late night spot."

The other evening I enjoyed a 17 oz. bone-in ribeye and a side of jalapeno creamed corn...all for a delicious $13.00.  While it still makes for a good $26 entree (ordering this dish during non-happy hours gets you two sides instead of one), getting this for half price only sweetens the deal.  This is one of the better deals I've come across in a while.  Don't get dragged to a Station Casino looking for their late night steak and eggs;  this is the place to be!\n\nThe bartenders are the other stars here at Herbs and Rye.  They have been able to make all drinks that my friends and I have ordered without giving us a blank stare and asking, \"What is that?\"  This is a refreshing thing to see as compared to other establishments.  My friends have been very impressed by the drinks crafted here; I think they make good drinks, but nothing on their menu has really made my palate scream for more.  I'm perfectly happy ordering an Old Fashioned here, though, which I can't say about 90% of the other bars out there!\n\nOne nice thing that's happened recently is that all the video poker machines have been removed from the bar!  This makes for an even better place to grab a few drinks and a meal if your party is small enough to sit at the bar.  Nectaly has been a superb host, remembering customers and always asking customers how their experience has been.  Herbs and Rye is another repeat eat for me here in Las Vegas!"

Before moving back to Vegas, I did my research, read the reviews, and decided that Herbs & Rye was my new favorite bar before I even visited! Unfortunately, it's not very close to my hood, so it took a couple months for me to make it over, but here is the lowdown:\n\nPros\n*Cool cocktail menu with lots of classic drinks.\n*Fair prices during regular hours.\n*Awesome prices during happy hour.\n*Free drink for yelpers every time you visit.\n*Cool ambiance inside.\n*Friendly bartenders who genuinely wanted to make us drinks we loved.\n\nCons\n*Location. It's really not near anything else, so it's definitely inconvenient to go out there if you aren't either a resident of the West Sahara area or staying at the Palace Station.\n*Crowd. As in, there was none. Why was it completely dead on a Friday night???\n\nOverall\nI'll be back to H&R to enjoy their cocktails and happy hour (maybe even to try the food?), but it's just too far to become a regular."

H&R is located next to a gas station, and I feel like it's kind of ghetto around the restaurant.\n\nReservation was for 6pm on Friday.  We arrived a little late because there was no parking in their small lot.  After circling the lot 2 times, we called H&R and they said the next best place to park at is Eyeglass World, 2 lots to the west.  \n\nUpon opening the door to the restaurant, you are blasted by a wall of darkness.  We waited for the hostess to get off the phone, then she led us to our table.  BTW, the cushion seat against the wall is SOO much more comfortable than that wooden chair!  It takes your eyes about 20 mins to adjust to the darkness, but it was still very uncomfortable and disorienting to be eating with such dim lighting.  Not to mention that you can hardly see the food you're eating.\n\nI would say the decor is a mix between pool hall meets back alley.  \n\nDishes tried:\n- Appetizer: calamari ($17) Some server brought this out and immediately my date and I commented on the lack of sauce.  Legit, there was a drizzle of the aioli sauce, or at least from what we could see of the dish.  We ended up asking our waitress for more sauce later on and then she brings out a boatload in a gravy boat.  We could have done with that earlier...  Overall, lacking sauce and overpriced. \n- Steaks: Porterhouse and NY Strip steak.  Filet part of the porterhouse was really tasty.  NY Strip steak was on the rare side for the medium requested.  \n- Sides: waitress said the truffle mac & cheese and jalepeno corn are \"the best\" sides.  We got those with our dishes and boy, were they horrible!  Let me first say that I am a mac & cheese and corn connoisseur, and these sides did not meet my standards.\n    - Mac & cheese tasted like frozen Stouffer's.  Had that fake not real cheese taste.\n    - Corn also tasted like frozen corn and towards the end of the meal, the corn texture got thicker.  Yeah, twas gross. \n\nDude, if I wanted a frozen meal, I would have gone to Trader Joe's.  \n\nBOTTOM LINE: I wouldn't even come back here for their happy hour.  Not a pleasant dining experience."

Their happy hour deal on steaks finally reeled me in.\n\nI had a wonderful time with a group of five friends. The decor was cool. A lot of wood panels and low lighting. We had an awesome server. Her name was Ally I believe. She gave us recommendations on cocktails and food. She was spot on with the recommendations after we let her know which liquors we like.\n\nMy drink was delicious. I wish I could remember what it was but I don't. I know it had egg whites though. After one drink I was feeling a nice buzz. I didn't even taste the alcohol & the drink was delicious.\n\nSo during happy hour they have half off steaks that include one side. I got the New York strip with a side of truffle mac and cheese. My steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. It was tender, moist, and succulent. I believe it was 16oz and came out to $18 during happy hour. \n\nDuring happy hour they also have $5 well drinks. I did opt for a rum and coke. It was a non-spiced rum and I thought the drink was delicious.\n\nI was so scared to come in here for no reason! I found out their cocktails are all $11-$12 dollars. These are craft cocktails that's are expertly mixed. \n\nI just had a great time and that really tied the visit up for me. I had a great drink to start the night, an inexpensive well drink to keep it going, and finished it off with some delicious food. It was a great experience with a light price tag.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try all of their cocktails."

The food is delicious from the steaks to the sides to the desserts. However, what I didn't expect was to pay more than 30% gratuity. The gratuity, it appears, is based on the full menu price of the items AND taxes. As a server, the government has never calculated my tips on taxes, so to pay gratuity on taxes seems a bit ridiculous. When I researched yelp to see if anyone else had commented on this, I noticed several did. Then I noticed, one guy, received a response from the owner; which was incredibly rude. I've never seen a response like that and I can't imagine someone being in business with that attitude. Want to see for yourself? Go to Herbs and Rye and in the search box place the word gratuity, then search for Bob C. Amazing! I'm secretly hoping the owner responds to my review, so I won't feel bad not returning. I considered it until I read her response. WOW!"

Unfortunately, I didnt experience the wheel of a deal during happy hour, but I didn't regret even one sip paying full price!  Open up the menu and you will find a brief description on the origin or a fun fact of each cocktail.  From the Sazarac to the Moscow Mule chilled and served in its original copper mug, each one is worth giving a try.  The Bartenders take their trade seriously here which makes for a very artful show on its own!"

They waited until we were finished our course, but didn't clear the plates, so we were getting plates on top of plates. I ordered my second cocktail before we got entrees and it didn't come until I was almost finished my meal! It did take a little too long for drinks that night. I'd go back to try it out again, but if I get the same service, that would be their last chance. I do have to say the desserts were really great! The doughnuts with dipping sauce and pazookie style cookie with ice cream...mmmmm!"

The guy at the host stand even had a fedora on. \n\nWe were here for dinner with friends, but got here early for a drink. We were greeted at the bar by Emily who might be the friendliest bartender I've met yet. She was super knowledgeable and offered us drink ideas based upon our favorite selections.\n\nThe menu has an incredible selection of drinks. It's very speak-easy style. So many great choices!\n\nAfter the bar we moved to the restaurant. After about 20 minutes, the hostess finally came over and asked if we needed anything and said they would find us a waiter. About 10 minutes after that, we finally had a waiter. He was welcoming and pretty knowledgeable about the menu. We placed our order and the food took over an hour to prepare.\n\nThe food was really good. I had a filet minion with the herbs & rye house rub. I also had the Mac n cheese along with the jallepeno corn. My steak temp was not as warm as I'd like it to be. \n\nWe ended up not ordering dessert. I would've considered, but was afraid I'd have to wait a long time for it. If they improved their food service, I'd give this place 5 stars."

The elixirs you'll find coming across this bar are seriously top notch and could stand their ground against any in my favorite coastal cities such as Portland, Seattle, SF and the like. I'm so glad  to have found this spot (thanks to all who recommended it and to Misti for taking me there) and it will definitely be on my itinerary for any return trip.\n\nThis is the lest \"Vegas\" bar in Vegas,  and that's one of the big reasons I am drawn to it. No flashy BS, no gaming, no smoking, no crazy-extreme high prices on the drinks, and almost zero pretense. Nice guys making stellar drinks in a chill, subdued setting (at least when I was in there) that's free of all the glam and glitz that exists a few blocks away. Nothing against that stuff (my stop prior to this was for a delicious cocktail at the fancy Vesper Bar) but I sure do love me good cocktails minus the snoot. \n\nThe cocktails on the list are all classics, organized by the decade that gave birth to them. The list is medium-length but very carefully curated, and I found no less than three of my favorite elixers jumping off the pages and into my glass. The two drinks I sampled were a Vieux Carre (a personal fave) and a Remember The Maine (also a fave). Both were impeccable - perfectly balanced with a nice depth of flavor. High quality ingredients and trained hands sure do make some fine drinks. \n\nThe story behind the guy who owns the place is a cool one too. He started out at the bottom and made is way up to the top - self taught. I respect that. And his humility and charm is something often not seen amongst the highest level of mixologists. He's a true barman. \n\nThe food menu is hearty and tasty. I only sampled the truffled mac side fior $7 (a hearty portion) and it fit the bill. \n\nFor a respite from overpriced drinks and chaos of the strip, get thee to Herbs & Rye. You'll make up your $$ on cab fare after only a couple of drinks and you'll be so glad you did."

Steaks were mediocre & chewy & dry instead of the normal moist & melts in your mouth. Waiter kept trying to up sell everything even after we told him we were fine. Took forever to get drinks. Sides that we ordered w/ our meals were meh as well. Asparagus had no flavor, jalapeno creamed corn was cold, cheddar broccoli was gross - was like cheese whiz melted on broccoli. Since 2 of us share a steak we opted to add another additional side of sweet potato tator tots - seriously $7 for those things? Not worth it. Mind you we didn't add the (for more $$) marshmallow crap on top (it's gross anyway) but no plain sweet potato tator tots are worth $7. The best sweet potato tator tots I've had in this town were @ BB Kings which is unfortunately closed. I will give a proper shout out for the little neck clams. They were great in the garlic white wine broth. Got extra bread to soak up all the great juice (btw - had to has 2 times to get the bread finally the bus boy was the one that brought it to us) Bill was $249 (before tip) for 5 people @ happy hour time & 2 of us even split a steak. There are no drink specials on their \"specialty\" cocktails. They are $10 apiece but says that nowhere in the menu & waiter doesn't mention the price. They need to hire more waitstaff to take care of patrons as everything took forever like I said I waited there before & it's never taken as long as it did on this visit.

We were the only ones in the main dining room with maybe 6 people in the bar area. The atmosphere was pretty cool, but ruined by painfully slow service, and servers who had poor fine dining etiquette. We all ordered steak and most ordered a simple side of mac & cheese or mashed potatoes and I really started getting nervous as the time passed... A half an hour later our food came out in 3 separate groups with at least 5 minutes between each one. I ordered a medium rare flat iron steak and my food came out last. As soon as the server set down my plate I immediately cut all the way through the center and.......hockey puck....well done with not a drop of juice.... I was practically insulted... After a quiet \"sorry about that\", and once everyone was done with their food I received a replacement steak that was delicious and cooked to medium rare, however it did not make up for the fact that I had waited forever just to have everyone in my group ready to leave watching me eat my steak. We received 2 desserts to share between 8 people, I guess this was their way of trying to make up for a horrible night.... \n\nDue to the reviews I may give this place one more try if I happen to be in the area, but only during happy hour because the prices do not justify the service and experience provided.

To get it started, we went during Happy Hour. Happy Hour is from 5-8pm and 12am to some un-Godly hour. It includes the choice steaks, well drinks and beer and some appetizers and such. A fair deal for steaks you usually overpay for in most cases. I came here with a bunch of friends for a nice relaxing, cheaper than usual meal.\n\nI won't complain about much, the service was great and I wasn't misled on any of the items. Usually when you go to a place, the server will try and sway you from the Happy Hour deal for their own benefit. Not here, our waiter pretty much made it seem like we were crazy to choose any of the full priced items. I ordered a Red Amber beer because it was Happy Hour and when I got it, it was a little warm. He did tell me they were changing the keg, but I assumed that it would still be cool. Not in this case, I still drank the darn thing because I have problems, but it wasn't as refreshing as I probably expected. \n\nSpeaking on my behalf, I ordered the \"Bone in Kansas City Strip,\" which I added a spice to the steak (it started with a Ch- kind of deal, I can't recall - but it was olive oil, garlic and thyme I want to say). You also get a free side and I splurged and got the truffle mac n' cheese. Overall  the meal was delicious and I was super full after eating. I wish that you didn't have to pay 3 bucks to put the topping on the steak, but I mean when you're paying half price for $30-40 steak it's worth it. My steak did have bone in, but it was oddly peculiar that there was bone also lining the rim of portions of my steak. A tedious process to cut around, but again, steak is steak and a man likes to work and earn his food. \n\nOkay, so I left and proceeded to have a horrible night. I spent more time with the toilet then I did with my girlfriend that night, our date night. My stomach did not feel good and I was miserable after. Maybe it's the mess that is my body or maybe it's the food I ate, but I didn't enjoy the feeling. I haven't ever had food poisoning and I don't think I even had it at all, but the feeling after the meal I had wasn't normal. That being said, it may be a little bit till I go back because I may have to get bowel reconstruction (a joke -__- ). I don't blame on it on the place, but I just have to say I didn't feel like that until after the food. So, I applaud the efforts of the Herbs and Rye staff and I will be back. But when my bowel is ready for another round. Otherwise, people should come here for some decently priced food and drinks!"

The decor is downright cool. The bar looks like a lab conducting experiments! My coworkers were at the bar waiting for them to get our table ready. Once it was ready we took our seats. We weren't given any menus so we just sat there a while. As soon as our server finally came over to fill waters we asked for menus. A majority of the 10 people at our table ordered off of their hand crafted cocktail list. It seemed to take FOREVER for our drinks and our server didn't use the time to take appetizer or dinner orders to help....now our entire table was full of servers from a steakhouse so we remained calm and understood what was up. I was 5th to order and I went with a medium rare ribeye and my side was the Mac n cheese. We ordered the calamari and little neck clams for our apps. And we all ordered different sides to have variety to share. So the clams came out and they were AMAZING! I could dip bread in that sauce for the rest of my life!! After a while our food starts coming out....calamari showed with dinner. So they brought out the first 4 people's food first then the next tray had the other 5 people's food.....where's my food? Everyone was eating and our server never came back to check on us so I couldn't tell her anything!!! I didn't want to make a scene but finally 15 minutes later she comes with my food. No I know this is a small restaurant so maybe they didn't have enough room to cook my steak. But I had ordered in the middle and she never came to let us know it's on its way or anything. And worse off 5/8 steaks ordered were over done. Our sides were AMAZING and the calamari was different and GREAT. But our steaks were sad :( and my Mac was gritty and didn't taste very good, no one at it....so we had asked about dessert before we had ordered food and because of the pics on here I knew I wanted those doughnuts!!!!!! So we ordered 2 doughnuts and 2 cookie things. She came back and said no doughnuts whaatataaaaaat you just told us there were doughnuts!!!! So we get our cookies and they are obviously burned. To the point if I had been serving it I wouldn't have let it touch the table. \n\nWill I return? Probably! For doughnuts and for clams and brussel sprouts. Not for steaks or to sit at a table. We'll stick to the bar."

I came here with two friends on a weekday evening for dinner. \n\nMy only complaint was that the lights kept changing for some reason from normal dining atmosphere dimness to really really dark and it was kind of distracting. At one point we even joked and were wondering if we were about to witness a performance. Also parking was kind of annoying and I had to park in a sketchy ally quite a ways down from the building, but it wasn't the end of the world. \n\nI had a moscow mule to drink and it was AMAZING. It is one of my staple drinks and they served it with a ball of very finely crushed ice inside of a copper mug which made it more of a slushee moscow mule, but either way it was amazing.\n\nFor dinner I had the pork and figs and it was also amazing. Perfectly cooked and a VERY thick cut of meat. It was served over potatoes.\n\nThe service was also really good, and best of all was the happy hour pricing which made what could have easily of been a very expensive dinner, a pretty reasonable one. I cannot wait to go back soon!"

We headed away from the strip to Herbs & Rye.. a place that my friend had heard of and wanted to visit.\n\nPulling up, I had to tell myself that outside appearances are often deceiving. We parked outside the rather plain building and walked into a beautiful restaurant. After my eyes adjusted to the super low light level, I saw exposed brick walls accented with deep shades of red splashed throughout the place.\n\nWe made a reservation on OpenTable and were seated immediately after checking in with the hostess. She gave us a choice of sitting at a table in the bar area, or a seat in the main dining room. We chose to sit in the dining room so we could chat. With only 6 or so tables, it was perfect to carry on a conversation.\n\nI was really looking forward to a drink after reading the reviews on Yelp and seeing the photos other reviewers had added. A killer headache kept me to water only, but I definitely had drink envy when the party next to me started getting drinks. The menu was smaller than I expected. Steaks make up most of the main course options along with few pasta dishes, but they do have starters, salads and flatbreads.\n\nOur server came over and welcomed us, and let us know since we arrived before their 8am Happy Hour ended, all of the items marked with stars were half off. This definitely changed my mind, and I went for the 8oz flatiron steak with a side of asparagus. Normally $28, I got it half off for $14. Not too bad.. and definitely cheaper than I could have found anywhere on the strip. I will say my first choice in sides was Brussel Sprouts, but they were deep fried, which turned me off of them. Most of the sides were deep fried, and when it came to healthier side items, the menu definitely was lacking.\n\nThe steak came out perfect. Seasoned only with salt and pepper, my medium steak was juicy and absolutely delicious. I felt bad not being able to eat it all.\nThe asparagus, on the other hand, could have been better. It was served in a small cast iron skillet and had been overcooked to the point of almost losing all of its beautiful green color. It was mushy and swimming in butter and had absolutely no bite to it at all. Perhaps I should have stuck to something in season... or perhaps it shouldn't be on the menu if it's not fresh.\n\nAside from the asparagus, everything else was spot on. The steak was delicious. The service was impeccable, and my water glass was always full (and I drank about a gallon of water). Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a place off the strip for a night out."

Shortly we moved up our reservation to 7:30pm and Michelle responded with \"sure\".\n\nWe arrived at 7:05pm but circled the parking lot twice and thought maybe we should eat elsewhere.  However, after 15 minutes of circling Chinatown, we decided to try Herbs and Rye once more.  Found a parking spot - at this point it was 7:25pm.\n\nWalked in with a sleuth of people waiting looking very anxious.  Approached Brittney at the podium and was immediately attacked in a loud tone that we were late and can't hold tables more than 30 minutes.  I explained to her that our reservation changed to 7:30pm.  Showed her the email and Brittney's response was \"well no one told me!\"  My husband and I were shocked to have been spoken to in that matter in front of a line of customers.  The waiting area is very small and narrow that the waiting customers can't help but hear the conversation. Brittney says we'll need to wait 30 minutes since she was never informed.  Not even a apology.\n\nWe walked out as  I refuse to be ridiculed and belittled by a 21 year old who has no clue when it comes to service.  Treating customers as if we should be honored that she's holding the golden key into dining with Herbs & Rye.\n\nWe drove from the Southwest side because of the raving reviews and recommendations of this restaurant.  No thank you.   Not wasting our hard money for tactless experience.  We opted for dinner on the Strip.  Pricier - but a better and classier dining experience. \n\nIt's unfortunate that Britney is Herb & Rye's front face and first point of contact.  Suggestion: send her to customer service and etiquette training."

We had reservations at 5:30 and their Happy Hour is 5-8, however, nobody was being let in and nobody from the restaurant was telling the growing crowd what was going on, which was beyond frustrating.  There were delivery people trying to get in but they wouldn't let them either.  \n\nThey finally opened the doors at 6pm and checked in.\n\n#NOTE;   If you want a booth... you have to reserve it while you're making the reservation.  Who knew?  You'd think with the 1,000 questions the staff asks you while ordering, this would have been something they would have mentioned... but I guess it's not an 'add on', they don't care.\n\nWe got seated and IMMEDIATELY, \"What kind of cocktails can I get you?\"  I mean, as we were sitting down and not even looking at the menu yet.  We asked for a minute and literally got a minute, \"Decided on some cocktails yet?\"  Geez-us.  We asked for water for now and she was clearly upset.  Like, relax with the pushiness, we'll friggin' order cocktails.  Then she came back again, like a minute late and we finally got something without looking, not knowing what \"Happy Hour\" entailed.  I ordered a Riesling, my friend's boyfriend got a Stella... neither was a Happy Hour price, as we hadn't really had a chance to look things over yet.  \n\nSo, their Happy Hour... the 'big draw' are the steaks.  It's crazy how they're listing them around $40-$48 a cut, like this is a top tier steakhouse on the strip... pretty laughable actually.  However, you get \"half off\"... bringing the price to EXACTLY being slightly overpriced.  It got a NY Strip... there was some gristle here and there, not the best cut of beef, not the worst... just like a typical steak you'd get at a super market.  Clearly it wasn't aged (which sounds 'snooty', but for the $40ish price point, you expect that).  \n\nThere are TWO wines on the \"Happy Hour\" list and very mediocre ones.  I just had the Reisling, which was good.    \n\nNow, here's the kick in the balls... the \"bacon.\"  When we're ordering, the waitress kept asking, \"With bacon?\"  Does it come with it?  Dunno... \"Um, sure.\"  Like idiots, we got it all around, not realizing how much extra it was.  $3!!!  She didn't mention it would be more but you assume it's like $1 or something.  So, we got bacon on the fries, the mashed potatoes, etc.  Guess what that $3 gets you... um, literally, ONE SLICE OF BACON.  ONE.  Uno.  \"A\" slice of bacon... placed on top of the fries.  The hell are you going to do with that!?  Chop it up and hide how cheap you are, at least!    \n\nAnyway... the side.  Very average.  The mac and cheese sucks, very bland, almost chalky. Fries are okay but the cheese isn't melted - it's just room temperature cheese thrown on some fries... with a slice of bacon curled up, laying on top. Brussel sprouts are shockingly good. Mashed potatoes are good. \n\nThis place was just a huge letdown.  The pushiness of the \"upsells\" from the waitress combined with the lackluster sides, the average cuts of the steaks, not being let in (and no explanation), and everything else just kinda blew it for us."

I had a 14 ounce NY strip. $21.00, the side was a small portion of Garlic mash. I  had 2 Pepsi 's $3.50 each. no refill.  the price was reasonable but the Steak was tough and the mash cold. my son ordered the 120 Oz special which came with 2 sides. Happy hour price for this meal was $180.00   regularly  $390.00 this special was supposed to feed approx. 8 people. the meat was better but again the sides were enough to only feed approx 5 people.  Total price for 15 people came to 843.00. including mandatory tip of 187.00. This is supposed to be the happy hour price of half off. I felt the prices were inflated especially because of the quality and portions of the sides. the steaks were served without any kind of mushrooms or onions. If you wanted a sauce of any kind you had to ask for it. It was not offered. I'm not against paying a fair price for a good steak however the quality of steak was like chuck steak. Myself and 9 other of the guest felt the same way. I do not recommend anyone should go to this restaurant."

The answer is most likely no, since you'd have to be in your eighties or nineties to remember it and I don't think anyone that age reads my blog. If you never had the chance to experience the drinks popular during prohibition and would like to, however, I suggest you go to Herbs and Rye. Not for the food (definitely not for the food), but for the drinks, which are terrific. In fact, you're not limited to drinks that were popular during Prohibition, but can enjoy the whole American history of drinking from the \"Gothic Age of American Drinking\" (1775-1865) to it's \"Revival\" (1990-present). No matter what you choose I'm sure you'll be happy. I've tried three, the Frisco from the Gothic Age (I don't even like whiskey), the Scofflaw from Prohibition (I don't like bitters), and the Diablo from the Reform years (gotta love tequila). Each has been exceptional, but I don't review cocktails, I review food.\n\nMy husband and I have now been to Herbs and Rye three times. We were disappointed the first time, somewhat less disappointed the second. In fact, we walked out after drinks and calamari the first time when we were with my parents because it took forever to not get our food. You might be asking yourself, \"Why would you go back a second time, let alone a third time ?\" Well, there are several reasons.\n\n1) We had been anticipating the opening of a new restaurant ever since they closed and we saw a new sign go up (though, that's really just a reason to try it a first time, I suppose).\n2) Every new restaurant deserves a chance to work out the kinks.\n3) It's close to home.\n4) We hadn't yet had a chance to try their 50% off happy hour, and 50% off food is great way to get you back in the door. (5-7PM and late night, M-F)\n\nThe meal always starts out fine. The drinks, as I mentioned, are spot on, and the bread is good, made all the better by sweet honey butter. The servers are pleasant, but then you order, and you wait...and wait. I understand the time it takes to make the cocktails (browns stirred, whites shaken) but there is no excuse for the food taking so long when there are a maximum of two other tables. The calamari ($7.50 with happy hour, pictured above) this time was much better than the first, so I was glad to see the improvement. The idea was good (peperoncini, crispy pancetta, and aoli drizzle) but somehow it ended up as a fairly uninteresting salty mass. Perhaps I am being too harsh. It wasn't so bad, and the portion was large, if you like that kind of thing. I suppose the most disappointing aspect was that it was a vast improvement. A long while after it left our table we got our Vitello a la Fiorentina, a veal T-bone ($18 with happy hour), which wasn't a T-bone at all. Our waiter admitted he had forgotten to tell us that the chef had changed it to a chop, which would have been fine if it was good, but it wasn't. Although it was cooked well, I don't think we were able to get more than six decent bites out of it that weren't ultra-fatty between the two of us. The mashed potatoes underneath weren't hot and didn't have enough butter, and the asparagus was completely void of seasoning. Forget about the \"caramelized lemon\" and white bean ragout, if you can even call it that. If we'd been paying the full price of $36 I definitely would have complained. What am I saying? I complained anyway. The chef took it off the bill, almost making me feel bad for being so negative in this review. Alas, a critic's job isn't always an easy one.\n\nThe chef truly isn't the only one to blame for the imminent demise of this restaurant, however, the decorator is. The dining room is supposed to make you feel like you are in old Vegas, but falls short in every way. The red felt wallpaper, fake leather booths, tiny chandeliers, cheap silverware and fake bookcases all add to the depressing ambiance. The worst, above all, is the music. It is more outdated than the drinks and is truly nauseating. I mean, I'm sure \"Suwannee River\" had it's day but it's 2010 now. Ian put it well. \"I think I'm going to slit my throat with this butter knife if I have to listen to this anymore.\" \"Wait!,\" I said, \"Let me finish that honey butter first.\"\n\nOverall, I'm not sure the 50% off menu even makes it worth coming here. I would truly like to see this restaurant continue to make improvements because they have a really great thing going with the bar. It would have been smarter of them to open up a much smaller place that focused on great drinks and served a few exceptional tapas, rather than investing $1.6 million in this huge, boring place (the young new owner unfortunately invested everything he had). My suggestion is to stay in the bar and order the drinks. Order lots of drinks, that way the music probably won't bother you as much. Who knows, you may even start singing along."

If you let them, they're really good about getting a feel for your flavor palette, and then being innovative with your drinks. They've got a huge assortment of beers and spirits.\n\nFriday and Saturday nights can get a little busy if you're coming for the bar, especially during their happy hour every night from 5-8pm. I suggest coming early, or right around 7 when the first crowd is finishing up at the bar. It's half off several drinks and some appetizers, but I really go for the muscles and steak. $30 ribeye steak and I'm there. It's not the greatest, but it's decent, and you can get it rare (real rare, which some places skimp on). I've also tried it with their house rub, which is pretty good.\n\nDefinitely the place I go when I want a good happy hour for some steak, muscles, and excellent craft cocktails. Don't know that I'd come for the food at full price though, to be honest, haha!"

My date ordered a MGD, my drink was made, served and his never arrived. The bartender was drinking shots with the men to our left and women to our right. Another party of four arrived and sat next to us. Bartender came to serve them and he asked for a beer again, never got it. Had to ask a completely different bartender and it finally arrived. A twenty five minute wait for a table turned into an hour (but it was Friday and HH). Got seated at 745 and promptly ordered our meals to score the HH steak price. Had the meatballs as appetizers and they were great!!! Slighlty spicey, but the goat cheese, melts slightly, rounds out the flavor giving it a silky smooth taste in your mouth. Ordered two medium ribeye, tasty steak but the steak hindered on medium rare rare and was more purple inside. Both steaks were undercooked. I informed the waiter and he took one steak back to cook a little longer. A steak is never the same redone and I was disappointed to go to a GREAT steakhouse and have the steak very undercooked. The Brussel sprouts were a miss as well. Extremely charred, one piece of swine and LOADS of cheese ontop. Normally I wouldn't care about the extra cheese, but I wondered if the cheese were hiding the burnt Brussels and lack of swine? Normally the brusses are fantastic!! Cut into fourths, slightly steamed and grilled to carmalize on one side (not all four and black). The swine ontop is cut to resemble thick pieces of panchetta and sprinkled all over. The one piece of swine was black, hard and not even edible. Overall dinner was a hit and miss. After the no beer, wait time, undercooked steak and burnt brussels we did not even stay for the AMAZING donuts (sigh). Being a steakhouse and price of the meal my expectations were that our food would be prepared as requested. Sending a steak back at a steakhouse is never a good thing."

So anything you order from their menu will be divine. And if by chance nothing on the meu speaks to you, you can tell the bartender what type of liquor you drink and give him an idea of what you are looking for in a drinks, say mangoes or something sour, and they will make it for you. They are so talented that the other day I went to the bar with a teetotaler and the bartender made her a drink with raspberries and stuff sans alcohol!\n\nThe service is also top-notch. We recently went on a friday with a large party and did not have reservations (I know, how dumb of us). The hostess informed us that the wait for a table was 45 minutes. 2 hours after we were barely being seated. At that point their happy hour had ended. We asked the waiter if he could offer it to us nonetheless and he checked and they did! Mind you, it was not their fault we hadn't made a reservation and thus missed their happy hour specials. So I think it was pretty cool of them to offer it to us. By this time we were super hungry and we all ordered steaks. They were delicious!

Every time drove past this restaurant the parking lot was always full (around dinner time). That is always a good thing! When we walked up to the building a little after 6pm, the black exterior and windowless building had a speakeasy feel to it. Opening the doors, it definitely reminded me of an older, classy, speakeasy type of restaurant. There are two dinning areas. We were lead into the area which also holds the bar. The bar is 3/4 the length of the building. Opposite the bar are booths. Chandeliers hang from the ceiling, dimly lighting the restaurant. While you wait for your dinner to be served they provide you with fresh baked bread and butter. We were lucky enough on out first visit to make happy hour. Which not only meant discounts on liquor it also meant 50% off our steaks. They identify which items can be discounted because of happy hour with a star next to the item. We ordered steaks and they each came with one side dish. In addition we ordered an additional side dish... we needed to try it all! The side dishes are served family style. Our meal was excellent as well as the service. Throughout our meal I noticed that the bar was continuously becoming busier. We left a little before 8pm and the place was still quit busy. I feel like I was the last to know about this lovely whole in the wall restaurant. They are always the best! There is not doubt that we will be going back.\n\n \nImpressed!"

I pulled up a seat near one of the wells a very friendly bartender named Emily took care of me. She was very nice. I tried two cocktails on their list a Frisco which I'd never had before and a Widows Kiss ( my very favorite cocktail that many bartenders dont know or don't have the ingredients in their bar to make). I love the Widows Kiss. I'd never had a Frisco before and didn't love the flavor profile but it wasn't a bad drink ( just not for me). I also had a flat bread with steak and arugula that was very good. \nNot only were the drinks good and the staff friendly they drinks are almost half of what you'd pay for a drink on the strip and they are solid. I'll be back here for sure."

Reponded... \"Killian's Irish Red???\". \"Oops! Excuse me! It's only Red... doesn't taste like Killian's.\"\n\nYes, the House Beer is Red... He was right... no way did it taste like Killian's.\n\nLittleneck Clams Appetizer (*** 1/2 $11.00 Happy Hour Reg-$22) Parmigiano, Lemon, Broth. \n\nSmallish Clams in a... watery Broth. Frankly, could have used more Butter... a lot more. Had better last year... somewhere else in Vegas...\n\nBread & Butter (**) I'm a Dipper, an expert Dipper from way back... Love to Dip Bread & Butter in Broth from the Clams Appetizer and from my daughter's Linguine & Clams entree. At first EVERYONE received their own individual six-inch mini-loaf of hard, over-baked Bread. Asked for refills... only two were brought out. Asked for refills again for just me, which the waiter didn't know... only received one loaf. I'll bet if I asked again... we would have been ignored...\n\nKansas City Strip Steak (** 1/2 $14.50 Happy Hour Reg-$29) Chose this Steak over the Filet... mainly because of the price and size, which was 12oz... the Filet was $34, but was only 8oz. Chose the Jalapeno Cream Corn as a side. Wanted to take it easy on the kids' wallet...\n\nWhen the entree came out... The Strip Steak was on a separate plate, which surprised me... and the Side of Jalapeno Cream Corn (which was Not Creamed!) was in it's own deep-oval dish almost as long as the plate itself.\n\nSteak, itself, was the thin, smallish Steaks you'd buy for yourself at the local Super-Market... the one's that are gristly, and that you'd always over-cook... never can get right because it's so thin. Hate to say this... the best part of the meal... the watery Jalapeno (Creamed) Corn.\n\nAlso received donations of....\n\n   Filet Mignon (**** 1/2) Word to Yelpers.... the ONLY Steak worth it's \n      price regardless whether it's Happy Hour or not is the Filet Mignon at \n      $34. $17, during Happy Hour, is an absolute bargain!\n\n   Linguine & Clams (*** 1/2) Used the same Broth as the Clam Appetizer.\n      Same conclusion... more BUTTER, PLEASE!\n\n   side of Truffle Mac & Cheese (***) Tasted OK... if you ignore the \n      over-cooked Macaroni!\n\n   Looks like I ordered the wrong things... all the way around!\n\nBee's Knees (* 1/2) Hand-Crafted Cocktails? They might be Hand-Crafted... but not by a qualified Barttender! NOT!\n\nWhen the drink, which consisted of Gin, Honey & Lemon came out, there was the thin film of dark Honey on top over the light-colored Gin & Lemon Juice which indicated inadequate mixing of the beverage - minimum 30 seconds of continuous shaking, stirring, mixing... whatever. Very amateurish attempt. Sorry, fellow Yelpers, whomever mixed this drink will have to go back to Bar-tending school...\n\n\nIf you want to \"do\" Vegas on the Cheap, I guess this place is as good as any versus the super-duper-expensive Strip. But, you'd compromise first of all with the character of the establishment.... first impression... Old-School, Dank Red-Velvet Wallpaper, and Dark, mood lighting. And then when you're seated, you're handed a hefty, black, faux-leather bound Menu... that should have been re-bound years ago. \n\nAbout twice as many people at the Bar than people having a sit-down meal."

When we first pulled up we were the first in the parking lot, but wow how quickly it filled up while us and others trotted in for our tables.  Bar was full in about 30 minutes of opening at 5pm.  Other tables were available, however I still recommend reservations.  Our server Christian was AMAZING!  Professional, great sense of humor, but most importantly knowledgable about the history of the restuarant and the menu.  He truly added to our positive experience.  Atmosphere was dark, old school, but cool.  Loved how different it was from the flashy bright neon lights of Vegas.  FYI limited parking we were lucky since our reservation was right when they opened, but leaving two hours later many cars were waiting for our spot. Now on to the food...\n\nSpicy Mussels -- 5 stars and best part is that they are on happy hour.  Sauce with delicious, loved dipping my bread in the sauce to soak up the juice!  yummy\n\nFilet Mignon -- perfectly cooked rare as requested, great flavor, no seasoning needed, large portion size 9 oz.  On happy hour list as well.\n\nNew York Strip -- again cooked as requested, large portion size 14 oz, great flavor.  On happy hour list.\n\nSides included with steaks:\nBroccoli and Sharp cheddar -- very cheesy, which I love, broccoli perfected cooked not to soft or too hard.  Definitely wanted more!\n\nTruffle Mac and Cheese -- white truffle, rich in flavor.  Definitely would get again.\n\nDessert:\nDonuts -- LOVE LOVE LOVE, fresh, light fluffy with light coating of sugar.  Love the ability to drown them in the dipping sauces of white chocolate and carmel.  OMG heaven!\n\nDrinks:\nFrench 75 -- as a champagne lover, I enjoyed this.  I would get again, however may try something new first.\n\nClover Club -- my husband got this, but I wanted to steal it!  Wow!  I will be getting this next time!  Smooth...easy on the palette with great flavor.\n\nHappy Hour Wine:\nPinot grigio -- good wine, big pour.\nCab -- surprisingly smooth and lighter than expected, big pour.\nBoth would get again.\n\n\nThe happy hour prices are surprising.  50% off our food items!  It was good enough to get at full price, but I would rather go during happy hour times and get more!  LOL It was a great saturday night dinner experience, we will definitely be back, recommend to others and will bring others.  I strongly suggesting give this place a try."

My wife got the ribeye and I got the NY Strip, and after having a taste of hers I wish I'd ordered the ribeye. My garlic mashed potatoes were better than my wife's truffle crispy fries (which weren't very crispy, to be honest) but those were still tasty. The littleneck clams appetizer was awesome. \n\nNo surprise, the cocktails were dead-on, and the donuts for dessert were freshly made and perfectly cooked.\n\nAll in all, I think it was worth the wait. I would bring friends here for drinks, definitely. I'm not sure I would feel so good if I were paying non-Happy Hour prices for the steaks, but with such a long and generous happy hour that's not really a problem."

The atmosphere is very romantic and actually kind reminiscent of a 1930s mob restaurant with the antique chandeliers, satin red wallpaper, and black leather pincushion style chairs. We both had a steak; myself the filet mignon and my fiance with the New York strip. Both were incredibly tender, cooked perfectly to order, and came with great sides. The cocktails are as exquisite as they are literally a piece of Americana with their list being in chronological order from different eras in history. The H&R donuts were an unexpected, but very appreciated gift from the house, but they were absolutely excellent. Imagine miniature donuts in a white chocolate and caramel glaze and sprinkled with just a dash of crack. Yeah, these little guys can't be legal. Allie (I hope I spelled that right!), our server was incredibly friendly and helpful in finding cocktails that hit our respective palates just right and left both of us feeling like we were royalty. However long it takes for us to be back in the Vegas Valley, we will be back to herbs and rye; that's a promise."

Steak flatbread had maybe 3 bites of steak. Wine pours are 3.5 oz.- below the 4 - 5 oz most pour. I don't mind paying premium prices for excellent dining but this place misses the mark on many levels.  Too noisy with annoying thumping music with everyone trying to talk over.

            "review": "Let me start off by saying that it pains me to give this restaurant anything other than a five star rating. Herbs & Rye happens to be one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley, I've recommend it to everyone. I've taken my family, my in laws, and sent any tourist (I work on the strip) looking for a great dining experience this way. Not only is the food (usually) always on point, but the ambiance is to die for. My husband and I live across the street and we frequent here for happy hour steaks, an amazing deal, and we live for their cocktail menu (if you're a gin fan do NOT pass on their Aviation cocktail, trust me). But with all that being said, I have to admit, that this last visit was absolutely sub par, if not down right disappointing. We went on a Saturday around 7, just in time to catch the half price happy hour, and were immediately seated, how ever we waited close to fifteen minutes for anyone to acknowledge us or take our drink orders. I understand it being busy, but there were only five other tables around us being occupied and they all had servers, however NONE of the aforementioned servers even glanced our way. Finally our waitress came forward and apologized for the wait, and took our appetizer and drink order. The calamari (another item NOT to be missed) came out in record time, but our cocktails took another 15 minutes. Again, it was a Saturday Night and we understand that these drinks take some time to make, so we weren't too perturbed by the wait on the cocktails. We put in our food order, a Filet with Chimichurri sauce and a Flat Iron with the House Rub, our sides were Button Mushrooms and Broccoli and Sharp Cheddar, and then we ordered another round of drinks. The wait was longer than usual, but again, it was to be expected on a Saturday night. However once we got the food we were a bit let down. Let me first say that the steaks were perfect. However, not only did our second round of drinks come AFTER our food (a testament to the wait times, we actually slowed down on eating so our cocktails weren't \"after dinner drinks\") but the sides were TERRIBLE. The Broccoli might have been one of the biggest culinary disappointments I have come across in a while. I've ordered it before and it's usually rich, creamy, and savory, however, this time the broccoli was so soft it was falling apart when I mixed it. The cheese sauce was so thin, runny, and tasteless, it was as if they needed to stretch the little bit in the bottom of the pot so they cut it with luke warm tap water and half assed mixed it together. You could actually see chunks of the original cheese sauce floating amid the broccoli/cheese/water mush. It was disgusting and I pushed it aside. The button mushroom (which are usually served whole and perfectly saut\u00e9ed with garlic) were sliced and overcooked. We ate most of the mushrooms but didn't touch the broccoli. I was hoping to inform our waitress about all of this, perhaps even send the Broccoli/Cheese/Water Mush debacle back to the kitchen and request the Mac and Cheese side instead. Alas, conversing with our waitress was apparently not part of tonight's menu. Not once during the meal did she ever come over to ask how or if we were enjoying our meal. Once we were done eating, the bus boy cleaned up our food and about 15 minutes later the server asked if we wanted anything else, but at this point we just wanted to leave. I was surprised she did't even ask if we enjoyed our meal, how was everything etc, etc. Normally the service is fantastic, however tonight, I felt like our waitress was almost 'dodging' us. My husband and I were very let down. I hate to say this, but from now on, if or when I recommend Herbs & Rye there will be an unfortunate and reluctant \"...but...\"."

However, I'm not a steak fan nor do I spend tons of money eating out.  \n\nI had the perfect opportunity to go the other day for my friend's birthday. I got there exactly at 6 which was the reservation time. The waitress was very friendly as she asked us if we wanted any cocktails or appetizers (I get it, it's her job to upsell and ask.) However, we were still waiting on the rest of our late party.  \n\nFinally everyone arrived. My friend ordered the beef carpaccio which had balsamic vinegarette, and tasted sour. It had arugula on top. I loved the veggies, but not the sour taste of the dressing. We ordered our food at approximately 6:30, and did not receive it until past 7:11. I get it. We were a large party (we had 12 people). My friend asked for extra bread. The waitress said she would put it in right away. We did not get it until my other friend asked 40 minutes later. Now, I'm not a steak fan, so I can't give too much opinion on my steak. When our food arrived, she gave me brussel sprouts instead of the truffle mac and cheese that I had ordered. The waitress did fix that mistake and bring me mac and cheese. Someone in our party did not receive his steak. There were issues with that which you can read in other reviews.  Half of the steak was medium rare and the other half was medium. I had ordered medium. My steak was COLD! As though it had been sitting there for a while. Maybe it was because I ordered mine medium and everyone else ordered theirs medium rare, so they cooked mine first and let it sit? I don't know.  The mac and cheese was nice and hot, but it just made my steak seem super cold. \n\nThey cleared our table  and gave each person a small plate and said it was for dessert since it was a birthday. Our waitress brought out the check and gave it to the birthday boy. Uh... we asked for separate checks.  10 min later she came back and said we can't do separate checks.  So we would have to calculate the price with tax and gratuity and tell them how much to put on each card. What a HUGE inconvenience.  \n\nThe manager came up to us and was told us that he would take care of us to get us out. UH... YEA that's what we were trying to do... You guys had your strict regulation of not splitting checks. You think I wanted to sit there and ponder over how much I owed. I felt that was super rude of him because I felt like he was wanted to get us out of there and just get rid of us.  The dessert finally came out, and it was beignets that I read in other reviews that they received complimentary. They didn't even give us enough for everyone in the party, and why did they even need to give us plates?  Plus it took FOREVERRRR!  Like, it was free, so I shouldn't really complain, but it came right as the manager came over to say that he was going to \"take care of us.\" \n\nSomething weird, when eating the appetizer, I didn't use my silverware, so when the waitress brought out the steak knives and forks, she took my napkin and silverware. Was she going to reuse? I didn't think much of it at the time, but I didn't have a napkin. Why the heck would you take mine?!? \n\nI'm not a fan of steak to ever come here again after the horrible service I had. The food was okay, but again steak is not my thing. I spent $18. I could have made my own steak and mac and cheese for way less and not experienced that."

This place doesn't fail and when we walked in around 8pm on a Friday night the bar was packed and the restaurant had a 30 min wait; deservingly so.\n\nThe bartenders are great and it has a very cool vibe with friendly locals who are happy it's finally Friday! Two couples moved around to fit my man and I immediately as we walked in and that was a really nice gesture. We had several cocktails and definitely began feeling tipsy on drink two. Pretty pathetic but these suckers were strong! \n\nAfter a short time we were called for our table and we were starving! Everything tastes better when you're tipsy! Well almost everything! \n\nSo let's get to the food. Started with a margarita flat bread which was good (still on my search for amazing margarita pizza) and then the filet sliders. These were by far the highlight of the experience. The meat was so tender with caramelized onions, horse radish sauce on a very soft potato bun (AMAZING)! Then we wanted something decadent and decided on the penne. It was so salty we couldn't take more then a few bites. It tasted like eating spoons full of salt. As tipsy as I was I couldn't do it. We told our waitress and she was kind enough to ask if we wanted it remade but we decided to skip as we wanted to save ourselves for something sweet. That dish was straight up nasty. We ordered the hot donuts and they made up for the pasta! Overall good food but that penne really screwed us up. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was over that.\n\nThe service was great. Strong cocktails to get a nice buzz going and maybe we just got unlucky with the pasta. Everything else was good.\n\nThe decor is cool with a very back in the day feel when the cool kids were bootlegging in dark places. I would definitely try this place again."

Finally, the moment came, and Diane and I passed through the darkened entrance.  We were there for the food--not the creative drinks--and looked forward to a sumptuous dinner.  \n\nFirst to be set before us by our friendly server Eddie A was delicious fresh-baked French bread and soft butter.  This was quickly followed by a lovely-looking Shrimp Cocktail featuring six medium-sized red-tailed and white-topped shrimps curled over the serving plate.  The cold crustaceans tasted very good after being dipped in the zesty traditional Cocktail Sauce that accompanied them.\n\nNext was a novel surprise: an Iceberg Wedge that, instead of being crafted in the shape of a wedge as expected, was about two-thirds of a head of Iceberg Lettuce that had been sliced straight through the top to resemble a high mesa somewhere in the Southwest.  Festooned on the flat leafy surface were slices of tomato, red onion, bacon, Bleu Cheese crumbles, croutons, and a rich and ample supply of Bleu Cheese Dressing.  This was an excellent, crunchy salad course. \n\nProduced after this were my 9 oz. Filet Mignon with Brandy Cream Sauce & Peppercorns, and Diane's 12 oz. Ribeye Steak.  My entree was largely medium-rare as ordered, but a few parts of it were slightly undercooked.  Diane's Ribeye, on the other hand, was overcooked--more medium-well than medium-rare as she prefers.  When asked if her steak was cooked as she had specified, she admitted that it was more done than desired, but said that it was okay and she would eat it.  \"No,\" said our server.  \"We'll prepare you another one, and take it off the bill.  We want you to come back.\"  My wife politely declined the gracious offer, and slowly picked at her steak and sides until not too long afterward when suddenly a steaming plate was placed before her, with a new, obviously medium-rare and glistening 12 oz. Ribeye mounted on it.  The kitchen had quietly prepared a new steak anyway.  She accepted the promising substitution, and her old steak was immediately removed.  This fresh and juicy steak she really enjoyed, accompanied by a luscious Macaroni & Cheese side with bacon added.  I sampled the Mac & Cheese, and the hot white cheesy sauce really was delectable, just as was the Brandy Cream Sauce that covered my Filet and provided a liquid base for it.\n\nWe had other sides to indulge in as well.  Sauteed Button Mushrooms were hot and meaty, and I opted for the deluxe version of Sweet Potato Tots with Honey & Marshmallow Crust.  Large marshmallows were nicely melted over tater-tot-shaped knobs of sweet potato that had been sweetened further with honey.  \n\nWhile we were eating our meals, mob movies were playing without commercial breaks on a large flat-screen TV mounted behind the bar and facing our booth.  It was actually quite enjoyable to have that as a backdrop, and we became engaged in following the action.  The final delight of the night was the gigantic, warm, and freshly baked Chocolate Chip Cookie a la mode that was presented with long trails of Chocolate Sauce drizzled across the massive cookie and streaming down the two large scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream that rested on top and stood like silent sentinels.  It was a great dessert, and a sweet way to end our leisurely stay.\n\n\nP.S.  True to our server's word, when the bill arrived, besides a 50% price reduction off the cost of my Filet for dining during the extended Happy Hour, no Ribeye Steak appeared on the tab.  It was an unnecessary but generous and classy gesture.  So, I reciprocated by leaving a substantial tip.  And, I am sure that we will come back."

Check again.\n\nServer was great about suggesting and recommending drinks to help us, as the menu is a bit overwhelming- the Blackthorne, Pegu, and Diablo were all tasty and strong without being too sweet. I do wish they offered better wines, and found it odd they don't have any beers on tap.\n\nThe littleneck clams app has a delicious lemon-herb sauce, but the half-price flat iron was the star: cooked to perfection, juicy, and well-seasoned. I'll have to come back hungrier to try a better cut. Sides of sprouts and truffle mac were both enjoyable, if a touch salty. Wish the HH menu featured more apps, like the flatbreads.\n\nIn addition to dinner and drinks, they make killer desserts. Our party couldn't decide, so we got both their seasonal apple bread pudding and their fresh-baked cookies. Both were massive and really hit the spot for the sweet tooth folks. \n\nI'll be back for more drinks and eventually the rib eye. Maybe next time I'll actually sit in the bar area, but the volume of the music was blasting even sitting in the quieter dining room area. Great retro-Vegas, blast from the past experience."

For a Saturday night, past midnight, crowd was not bad. Place was clean and music was awesome! They played a lot of old school jams w/videos, which I thought was pretty neat. The bartenders were quick and kept traffic moving along. However, the food-a bit too pricey. For those prices might as well go to a nice steakhouse. The waitresses spent most of their time chit chatting with the D.j. and shooting the breeze with the bartenders instead of attending to all the tables waiting to be served. Fun place for drinks, probably not the best place to go to if you're hungry. Long wait, expensive and not worth the price."

Craft cocktails with a very descriptive menu so that you can try new things and know the era in which it is from. My go to drink is the brandy cresta (if I'm spelling that correctly, lol). It's forward on the citrus side with sugar on the rim! I also had A brandy Alexander which is more in the creamy, after dinner side. Both were great and out of my normal bubble. \n\nNow let's get to steak!!!! They are known for their steaks!!!!! They are half off on happy hour. I hadn't been here Ina few months, I noticed they raised their prices, but still reasonable for happy hour. I ordered the NY strip with truffle Mac and cheese and added a onion and mushroom topper to my steak! I am a fan but of the topper option! With every slice I'm getting my toppings! \n\nIf you're looking for an experience, try and grab a seat at the bar! The mixologist are fun, captivating and very interacting! They might even take a drink with you!"

Not that I frequent here on a weekly basis but I've been in quite a few times. \n\nTheir menu is American fare with a focus on Steaks. They do have an decent seafood menu with clam and fish etc. I love their Happy Hour which is half off for all items with stars next to them on the menu. It's a great deal if your craving steaks! I personally adore their linguini & clams pasta in a white wine and garlic sauce. It's savory and portion size is decent for its price. The steaks I have mix feelings about. My gals and I ordered the flat iron and NY strip and each was requested to be cooked medium rare however the NY came out a little too rare. Too rare too tough, but whatever floats your boat.\n\nThe service provided last evening was pretty how shall I say crappy. We began at the bar and as always the bartenders were great. There were 4 of us so we dined at a booth. It's busy I get it and it's late night but it doesn't mean you should be understaffed and the guests should have to suffer for it. We waited a pretty long time after our food order, my stomach was coming alive!!Probably why we received many items on the house. Unfortunately, we had to remind our server several times of certain requests and it took another bjillion years on the check. O\u00ed, hopefully it won't happen in the future and we will just sit at the bar."

The lady and myself ate there on a Wednesday and every seat at the bar was filled for their happy hour (7pm). The two main parts of the restaurant were empty and they sat us at a banquette circular table in the bar area.  Little tight in the bar area as the actual bar itself is only a few feet away from the tables. So when you sit at a table in this area you are sort of forced to stare at the backs (and cracks) of the people sitting at the bar. Decor was retro and speakeasy like - place was clean and well kept. Red patterned wallpaper, TV's playing black and white movies and the music playing the old crooners (Frank, Dean, Sammy etc.). \n\nWe ordered two appetizers - the little-neck steamer clams and the fried Calamari. Both were amazing, very tasty and well presented.  The juice or broth that they present the clams in was to die for. They give you a piece of bread that you can dip into the sauce when you are finished eating. We took advantage and LOVED them both! \n\nGood timing in the part of the waiter had our steaks presented to us with enough of a break between finishing the appetizers and starting the main course. Every night they have \"happy hour\" till 8pm and feature all steaks 1/2 price. We took advantage. My date had the fillet ordered rare + (with a fried egg on top) and I went with the rib-eye medium rare with an au pove sauce. We each chose the garlic mashed potatoes as a side. \n\nSteaks were right on and cooked perfectly. Been having issue with this and the chef at Herbs delivered perfectly! The cuts and the sides were stellar and would compete with the best steakhouses on the strip. My rib-eye was as good, if not better than the steak I had at the Wynn, Bellagio, Cosmo and Venetian. \n\nWe each ordered two of the \"custom signature throw back cocktails\" from the lengthy drink menu. The menu spans the eras and the drinks from each time period. There are no prices on this section of the menu so be aware of what you are ordering. Most of these drinks fell in the high price or strip casino range ($12 - $15). Little too high priced for an off strip restaurant. They should also feature a couple drinks from this menu during their daily happy hour. Think people would take advantage. \n\nWe were way too full and passed on desert (but it looked and smelled delicious). \n\nBill came and the two of us racked up almost $150 in costs. Was a slightly taken back by this as those prices are what we do at a fancy strip restaurant. Seemed a little excessive for the local driven location. Might hinder price conscious locals? Might hinder us from going back more often, but we will most certainly go back. Food was delicious, service was on point. \n\nFood here is the big winner, food and service earned the 4 stars. \n\nGood job Herbs & Rye - enjoyed the visit."

The steaks are amazing, the sides are the best mac and cheese and mashed potatoes I've ever had. The fact they even have happy hour and half off steaks and certain cocktails is so awesome. And also the cocktails. Well all the bartenders there are true bartenders making amazing cocktails from all periods of time. They also just got rated best cocktail lounge in Las Vegas. Emily is an amazing bartender with skills and personality. I truly love this restaurant. Always best to call ahead and reserve a table if you have a few heads with you. They will always try to accommodate. Everyone there is smiling and enjoying having customers there right down to the bus boys. Thanks Herbs and Rye for being awesome. See you next week!!!"

The aesthetic was incredibly cool, with a jazzy vintage theme, the service was awesome, the food was delicious, and the drinks - which are the main event at Herbs & Rye - definitely lived up to the hype. \n\nThe parking lot is small but there are plenty of empty spaces in the businesses to the west, and just looking at the exterior, you would have no idea how classy (but not fussy - some people were dressed to the nines in the bar area but plenty were wearing jeans and flip flops) the place is on the inside. \n\nHappy Hour is from 5 (I think?) until 8, and most foods and basic mixer drinks are half off. That was an incredible deal and certainly one that will have me coming back to the restaurant. Their specialty drinks - which consume 3 whole pages in the menu, compared to the 2 pages of food choices - are really what H&R is known for, and for a good reason: they're unique in their flavor and strong in a way that drinks no longer are in Vegas these days. Arranged according to the historic era in which they were popularized, it is difficult to choose which one to order, as they are all so interesting. While they aren't included in the Happy Hour, they really hit the mark: for $11, I found myself pretty drunk after half a glass of my cocktail (admittedly, I am a bit of a lightweight, but still - it's a great value). \n\nFor drinks, I chose the Weekend at the Waldorf - a very sweet and fruity concoction that our waitress described as \"like drinking a pez candy\" - and I have to agree with her. I loved it. My friend got the Fogcutter, which was served icy cold in a fun ceramic tiki mug, and while it was a blend of liquors I'm not really into, she loved hers, too. For food, she got (and loved) the flatbread, which, as an app, wasn't included in the Happy Hour pricing. For $4 more, I got the NY strip steak with garlic mashed potatoes. The steak was very well seasoned and the mashed potatoes were creamy and flavorful. \n\nThis will probably be my new go-to date night venue. I highly recommend it."

The atmosphere is like a bar on the 60's like Sinatra times. The lighting is very dark, as a matter of fact too dark to even read the menu. Their drink menu is pretty cool, they have a large variety of unique drinks which illustrate a specific period of time. Some of the time representations were the Prohibition, Gothic , Golden age, etc.  Their speciality is their steaks. During happy hour (every day from 5-8) the steaks and the appetizers are 50% off. We ordered the Kansas City bone-in  which is a good choice if you like the grilled taste. I got the Filet Mignon which was juicy and very tender. The sides were very mediocre. They were something that I could probably do at home with no problem (and I'm not a good cook). We ordered the mac n cheese and the jalape\u00f1o corn, and they were equally disappointing. I saw a lot of small plates that look really good, perhaps I would come back and try them instead of the steak. Oh as an FYI, we read on the menu that you cannot share your steak if you buy it during happy hour! Even though we never planned on sharing, it annoys me when an establishment tells you what to do after you are paying for your food!"

My husband was also missing the bacon. They took our steaks in the back, threw some bacon on the plate and cut the white stuff off the egg!  Manager did not seem to care. Thought I found a good steak place close to home but guess not. I'd rather go to Mortons and spend 100 more."

We went there a little earlier, so we didn't get to try the happy hour, but for two drinks it was about 20$. I think thats reasonable. The docor is awesome too! 50s style, exposed brick, music in the background and the bartenders are wearing black and white. This place is very similar to Commonwealth (a bar downtown) and i will definetelly be back over and over again"

            "review": "We went there twice on our last trip.\n\nThe first time we were part of a group of 6. We got there about an hour and fifteen mins before happy hour ended and we got seated about 20 mins before happy hour ended. There happy hour is good because some of the steaks and a few other things on their menu are half off! While we waited we found an area to hangout around the bar. i personally don't like cocktails, but for people who do they enjoyed the cocktails there. There's no prices for cocktails marked on the menu, but they generally range $11-13. \n\nOur main table was nice. The restaurant didn't seem crowded or loud and our table was spacious. The restaurant decor is nice. I think our server was inexperienced (or just a bad server). One of the people at our table ordered a bottle of wine and the bartender had said they would make sure it got to our table. We asked the server about it a number of times and he seemed to have an issue asking the right questions and being able to get the wine. Overall he was pretty awkward. Three of us ordered pastas and he failed to bring over the complimentary bread until we asked. The issues with the services were annoying, but they weren't a huge deal. The part that definitely made it worse was that since we were in a group of 6 they automatically added the tip onto our bill- and it was on the non happy hour price. I wouldn't mind tipping that amount if the service were good.  But, the service we got did not come close to warranting the size of tip the server got.\n\nThe second time we went the service was great. The server was knowledgable. The guy that was helping clear tables and refill waters was exceptional. A water glass wasn't empty for more than 30 seconds before he had it refilled. \n\nAs for the food: My boyfriend had a steak and has said it was good, but nothing special. The mashed potatoes he had as a side were ok, but portion was small for the price. Our friends had sides or mac and cheese and that also was small. I had the linguine and clams pasta. It was good but lacked flavour. The main reason I would order it again is that it is on the happy hour menu so it ends up being reasonably prices compared to a lot of other things and since I'm not a steak eater its a good alternative. The spicy muscles were great!! I would definitely try them. I enjoy hot food, and they were spicy but not too spicy. It came with bread which was good for dipping in the spicy tomato sauce. We ordered the pappardelle. It was our mistake because we assumed there was a meat sauce with it. Was rich and had an overpowering garlic taste. Make sure you save room for the donuts. They are plain sugar donuts with two dipping sauces!"

A coworker told me about the happy hour here that runs from 5-8pm and 12am-3am....HALF OFF STEAKS! WHAT?!  Now that is my kind of happy hour! The 18oz boneless ribeye was $24 and comes with a side.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly and marbled well with fat.  We tried a few sides since we were with some friends.  Honestly, the sides were underwhelming (jalapeno creamed corn, sweet potato tots, brussel sprouts).  I definitely would not pay the regular price for the sides again.  A few of the appetizers were half price, so we tried the spicy mussels ($13).  The marinara sauce that these mussels come with is addicting, we kept asking for more bread to sop up all the sauce.  The bread is warm, freshly toasted baguette and perfect for soaking up all the garlicky goodness.    Honestly, the price of most of their happy hour items is what I would probably expect to pay normally.  The items on their food menu seem grossly overpriced for this location, so unless you are here for happy hour....I say there are better options.  I highly recommend if you want a good steak and don't want to pay a visit to your cheap steakhouses like Outback, then to come give Herbs and Rye a try.  Also make sure to sit in the bar area, the regular dining area seemed dead."

Damn it's been over a year!\n\nThis place has that old school speakeasy vibe that I've been looking for (don't let the outside of this joint fool you)..... \n\n-dark lighting to set the mysterious and chill vibe right. CHECK\n\n-simple, classic styled furniture and decor as if you walked right back into the past.  CHECK\n\n-leather booth seating.  CHECK\n\n-small, quaint, and not a manufactured corporate chain.  CHECK\n\n-friendly service that knows their menu inside and out.  CHECK\n\n-damn simply,  a classic, cocktail lounge with character!\n\nThere's two sides to this joint, the restaurant side and the bar side.  Pick the side based on your purpose for being there.  Duh, I was here to drink....so straight to the bar I went.  The bar is the perfect place to chat it up with the bartender and ask questions about the drink menu if it's your first time here.  Mike (our bartender for the night) was very friendly and explained the menu very well.  School was in session.  Great service overall.\n\nI cannot speak for the food since I came here purposely to drink and chill.  But from what I saw and smelled everything looked great.  Some random girl next to me ordered the donuts.  They looked so damn good I was gonna chat her up and see if she was willing to share!  She was a cutie, but it was the donuts I really wanted.  Hahaha.\n\nAnyway, back to the real reason for this review....the DRINKS!  I cannot explain well enough how awesome these drinks were.  These drinks are handcrafted, classic drinks representing different eras of American drinking.  \n\nWait, did I tell you they were handcrafted?  Yes, handcrafted!  Hold up.....let me change that....these weren't just any drinks...these were cocktails.  And the cocktails weren't just poured....these were handcrafted.   Dammit......these were Handcrafted Cocktails!  No pre-made mixers or store bought juices used at all.  Cocktails shaken by hand over one shoulder.  Fresh cut fruits for the juice or zest only.  And a little bit of fire for the Blood and Sand cocktail.  Watch out now!  Very entertaining to watch these bartenders make your drink.\n\nI listed below the eras the different cocktail menu items represented:\n\nGothic Age of American Drinking (?-1865)\n\nGolden Age of American Drinking (1865-1900)\n\nOld School Age of American Bartending (1900-1919)\n.\nProhibition(1920-1933)\n\nYears of Reform (1934-1948)\n\nDark Age of American Drinking(1949-1989)\n\nThe Revival of the American Drinking(1990-Present)\n\nSide Story:\nI came here on a recommendation a couple of bartenders (Kevyn and Jonas) from the Social House (yes I was drinking there earlier that day too) made to me when I had asked if they knew of any place in Vegas that was a chill, low key place that was unique.  They had asked in return if I was looking for something on the Strip or off the Strip.  I mentioned that I've done the stereotypical Vegas scene plenty of times already.  They told me specifically to check out Herbs and Rye.  And I'm glad I did!\n\nMy buddy and I tried a few drinks that were recommended to us by the bartenders from Social House:  Aviation, Blood and Sand, and Vieux Carre.  \n\nWhen my buddy asked what was another good cocktail from the menu, Mike our bartender of course replied \"everything\", and then continued to handcraft a cocktail called Corpse Reviver No. 2 for him.\n\nMan, they were all good!  Next time, I'd probably start with the Vieux Carre for the full, bold taste and end with the Corpse Reviver No. 2 which is more sweet and refreshing.  The Aviation and the Blood and Sand were somewhere in between.    I highly recommend all these cocktails.\n\n\nSIde Notes:\n\n-We came here for late night happy hour 12AM-3AM and only spent $9 a cocktail.  There's no way on the Strip we would've gotten strong quality handcrafted cocktails like these for $9 each!   Tell me if you do.\n\n-It was Late Friday Night/Early Saturday Morning when we rolled in and they were spinning old school Hip Hop!\n\n-It wasn't packed in here at this time and the clientele seemed more like locals then tourists. \n\n\nOkay yeah I get it, people come out to Vegas from all over to party up on the Strip....  dress up all fancy, throw cash around like you're dirt rich, drink expensive drinks, etc.  After awhile isn't always the same?  If you wanna check out something different check out Herbs and Rye.  At the very least start your partying here for the earlier happy hour...then head out to the Strip.  If you're already partying on the Strip, you'd probably wouldn't physically be able to make out here for the late happy hour (yeah I know you party hard).  In case you do, it's the perfect place to unwind and chill for a couple more cocktails before going to bed. \n\nSo what if  I left this place about 3:30AM and feeling really good and ready to continue partying....don't judge me!  \n\nDefinitely coming back when I'm in town"

We got both the clams and mussels which were half off during happy hour (from 5-8pm every night!) as well as a variety of different cocktails. The mussels were spicy and soaked in a delicious garlic sauce, that was so delicious, that we asked for extra bread so that we could sop it all up. The clams were drastically different in a creamy butter sauce, but equally delicious!\n\nThe cocktail menu is a work of art and a history lesson all in one. Along with the ingredients of each drink, the menu also details how the drink was originally created, and when. With so many choices, we had some difficulty choosing, but the waiter was ready with the recommendations, and he chose a perfect drink for each of our tastes."

I had high hopes for this place based on 2 friends who have gone during happy hour for the steak and I was not let down at all from the moment the 'Littleneck Clams' hit my tongue. My date and I also ordered the 'Spicy Mussels' which were also delicious, since both of these seafood appetizers were on happy hour. I did not choose a drink from the amazing time period cocktail list. I was looking for a certain taste for my cocktail choice and the waiter suggested a fine cocktail not on the list and I absolutely loved it! We ordered two '14oz New York Steak Strips', one with 'Peruvian Chimichurri' and one with 'grilled onions'. If you ordered one steak to split, they will charge you $7. For our sides, we got 'Garlicky Spinach' and 'Truffle Mac & Cheese'. EVERYTHING was cooked perfect and every bite had me weak in the knees and melting on the table. We were so distracted by our food that we barely touched our drinks until we were done eating. We were so full that we didn't try their dessert. You don't have to sit at the bar to enjoy their happy hour menu. I like the dim lighting and the way the restaurant/bar is set-up. The service was great and quick. There were maybe 25-30 other guests there around midnight. We will definitely be back!"

I started to run through their extensive list of cocktails and it took me a few seconds to realize how neato their menu was, broken down by eras.  It was sort of educational but fun, cuz it was booze. \n\nBecause I'm a fan of egg white drinks, I went with the Pisco Sour (also a fan of this drink anyway). And this was a doozy.  It was the fluffiest drink ever and the best Pisco Sour I've ever had the pleasure of throwing back.  I think the bartender's name was Joe.  He employed a multi-step shaking process and definitely got the volume other bartenders covet.\n\nOur friends showed up and we made our way to the entry area to greet them.  Unfortunately, the only damper on the evening was how long it took them to seat us since we had reservations and the table (as well as other tables) had vacant and ready to go since we started waiting.  Maybe they were trying to scrounge up a server?  I dunno.\n\nFood was impressive on the whole.  To start, we the calamari which was deep fried but then tossed with some sweet and hot peppers.  Yum!\n\nFor the main event, I ordered the filet mignon while hubby got the double cut pork chop.  Hubby thought the pork chop was decent, though a little overcooked.  My filet mignon was a perfect \"rare\" as requested.  Yum!  We shared a few sides including the jalapeno cream corn (delicious), garlicky spinach (really garlicky but not my cup o'tea due to a sweetness you don't usually get in this dish), and truffle mac & cheese (must order).\n\nDuring dinner, I had a couple more drinks - the Hemingway Daiquiri (good and not at all like the pink slushy stuff you think of when you hear \"daiquiri\") then went back to the Pisco Sour.  Unfortunately, this next Pisco Sour wasn't as fantastic as the first one.  Oh well!\n\nService was pretty attentive.  Our friends happened to be familiar with our guy (though I don't fault him for pretending to remember them) because he used to be the bartender.  He was very friendly, helpful and attentive.\n\nDefinitely going to be a place for us to come back to, especially for the drinks!"

Both of us heard good things about Herbs and Rye so I called an hour before and they had room, excellent.\n\nArrived and exterior looks like a classy bar. Walked in and was seated promptly. Looking at the menu, they didn't have the Mushroom Panzerotti that that was on the website menu. No problem, ordered the Linguine & Clams. The clams were really good as they were still in the shell so really fresh. I really liked the flavor of the clam juice with the wine, garlic and chili. Only thing that was disappointing was the pasta was overcooked. I like my pasta soft but it was like baby food. Didn't order dessert as we were on our way to a show. \n\nI would come back for drinks but not for dinner."

He managed to take my only record of the transaction from my girlfriend during her discussion with him then claimed that he did not take when whe asked for it back. No correspondence from the the email and no answer to phone calls. Dinner ultimately cost $320 for some basic food that way ovet priced with bad service. I'd stay away they seem to be ok with being shady business."

No windows, not much light, my hubby and I squinted as we tried to read the menus. Not to mention being blinded every time the door was opened.\n\nWe were seated promptly being the first ones there. We ordered an arugula salad, the gnocchi and the steak with a side of truffled mac 'n cheese.\n\nThe arugula salad was okay - but nothing special. The peppery flavour of the lettuce was rather unbalanced - requiring more acidity. It really needed something sweet to even those aggressive flavours out. Perhaps beets or fruit or something.\n\nThe gnocchi was delicious albeit it was slightly overcooked (I felt it was a little on the softer side). It was light and fluffy which is really hard to find. The ragu was also quite tasty and mellow. I didn't think that the gnocchi dish was improved with the addition of bacon and could do without it.\n\nThe steak was fine- cooked properly. The side of truffled mac 'n cheese was okay but not great. The sauce was a little too runny while the cheese overwhelmed the truffle flavour a bit.\n\nOverall, the dining experience would rate a 3. Just the gnocchi alone would get a 4. So we'll average it and call it a 3.5 star review."

The happy hour is top-notch as virtually everything on the menu, including some hefty entrees, is 50% off from 5pm-7pm, and then they have reverse happy hour, but darn it, I didn't notice the hours. I was being selfish. Sorry! Oh, wait, there it is right up there on the Yelp business listing: Late night 50% off 11pm-3am. This adds up quickly in a good way. My bar mate and I had five cocktails and some crispy calamari for $25. I am not even sure how that is possible, but it happened. \n\nI had a couple of Diablos- a tequila drink with ginger ale, cassis and lime. My friend had a Clover Club followed by two French 75s. She really liked the French 75; it is made with champagne. All of their syrups are made in house, and you can tell that they take pride in their craft. \n\nThe vibe is VERY dark and mysterious. I am still not digging their plates, but I guess that is a minor detail I will have to get over. It is balanced out by the wallpaper. Just don't look down at your plate if you can help it.\n\nThe bartender and staff are nice characters; they can be mysterious. I think they really take their prohibition theme seriously, which I can appreciate. I didn't have a dining room experience, but I enjoyed relaxing at the bar without being smothered by smoke! I am adding a star for a smokefree evening. If you sit at the end closest to the door, you get the ins on the restaurant action, as that is where all of the servers come to retrieve their drinks. I appreciate a little behind the scenes commentary. \n\nOh, and they are hosting special cocktail events on Tuesdays at 10pm. We had been there since 6:30, so we didn't stick around, but it looked like it was going to be a fun shindig. I received a rather handy Sailor Jerry dog tag necklace with a built-in bottle opener. I might check the event out next week. \n\nSo, keep up the good behavior boys! I am giving you five stars, and that is a very big responsibility."

However, the experience was beyond awesome not to give a huge cheers to the: ambiance, mixologists (bartenders), and food.\nHerbs and Rye is everything you want in a dark and sexy bar in a location that you don't want it in..which totally adds to its appeal and allure. (Thank the parking-lot gods, parking was easy breezy).\nThe ambiance is on point from the dimly lit bar and smartly dressed staff. I'm a sucker for period, artsy, glam, & gothic noir and this fits the bill. \nI sat at the bar and ordered my traditional rye-whiskey and ginger beer. However, I took plenty of time to let the drink menu school me in the ways & ages of alcohol:  Gothic, Golden, Old School, Prohibition, Rat Pack, & Revival!!! The bartenders at Herbs and Rye are mixologists and know the ways of spirits. \nSoooo, I've been around for some 30'ish years and I will go on record saying the tomato bisque soup is the best I've ever had...It's paired with an over the top delicious gourmet grilled cheese sandwich...So DON'T order the amazing yummy flat bread as a side like I did because I didn't read the menu far enough to see the grilled cheese. Ha! Beyond satiated!!!\nIf I didn't live in Portland Oregon this would be 'my spot'. \nI will absolutely be back the next time I visit Vegas. \nDo come hungry \nDo come thirsty\nDo make a reservation for the restaurant \nDo ask the bartenders to make you a 'surprise' drink if you don't know what you want\nDon't drink and drive. If you do drive parking lot is available, do have a designated driver. \nDo take a cab/uber...and believe me leaving sober isn't really on the menu \nDon't be alarmed by the co-ed bathrooms but do lock the doors, all of them."

I heard my friends rave about the atmosphere and the food quality so we figured, why not? \n\nSeating was quick although unfortunately it was in front of the bar. It would usually be okay if I were out with friends but if you're coming for an intimate night, between family or your significant other, be sure to call for a reservation and ask for a table in the backroom area. It'll surely help save your voice :P. \n\nBack to the amazing service, we ordered the clams appetizer as a starter. It was a decent size but probably not good to share with more than 2 people. The sauce that came with it was WOW. \n\nFor the main course we opted to get the King Kong steak, a gargantuan steak weighing in at 60 oz (that's 3.75 lbs!!!!!) along with a delicious side of mushrooms and Truffle Mac & Cheese (MUST HAVE). \n\nThe steak came out cold at first so we asked the waitress if we could get it warmed up for a bit. Out steak was taken away and we were promised to get our steak back nice and warm but something more impressive occurred. The manager came over to our table and told us he felt it was unacceptable that our meat was cold so he told us they were in the process of making a steak that would come fresh out the grill and straight to us. When the steak came out it was better than the first bites we first took with our other steak and we were all pleased. \n\nThe professionalism that the manager and the waitress demonstrated was beyond our expectations. \n\nWill we come back? HECK YES! Any restaurant that is committed to having customers leave happy is a restaurant worth revisiting. \n\nTip: Come from 5 pm to 8 pm to enjoy half priced drinks and some STEAK (amazing, right?)"

Parking is a little tricky cause the lot is small and people just make up their own spots along the wall. Some of my friends had to park in a different lot so that kinda sucked. When you walk in the restaurant has the typical steak house atmosphere... Red walls, chandeliers and dark lighting. \n\nThey have an extensive menu with a great bar and eclectic food choices. The double stars on the menu means that it's half off!  How awesome. This includes the steaks, pork chops and some appetizers. When is happy hour? Not really sure but we ordered around 7 to 730 which is prime time for dinner and we got happy hour prices. There were multiple waiters to fill our water cups, get drink orders and serve us basket after basket of bread.  Bread is delicious btw. It's warm and comes with whipped butter. \n\nWe had the spicy mussels to share for appetizers. It was delicious. Reminds me of boiling crab but less oily!  We ate all the bread and used it to soak up the yummy garlicky sauce. For half off it was a great deal. \n\nI ordered the ribeye medium rare and my side were Brussels sprouts. The steak was pretty big! It was really charred and crispy on the outside but on the inside it was a perfect medium rare.  The steak was sooo good!!  Juicy, salty, great texture with a slightly crispy outside. My first bite was heaven. The Brussels sprouts were super good too. It was very oily because it had thick cuts of bacon in it. I love Brussels sprouts and it's actually my favorite vegetable so these were great. I also got to try the truffle Mac and cheese and creamed corn. All were really good!  Can't really go wrong. \n\nAfter our meal we got a digestif. It was like a thick minty herbal syrup. Tasted a little liked chinese. medicine. Not for me but some people like it. \n\nMy 18oz delicious juicy steak was 30 bucks. Definitely will come back!!"

I had to try it for myself and I'll be damned if it wasn't every bit as good as advertised.\n\nDuring the first few minutes at the bar I asked the bartender if they could make a particular drink I'm recently obsessed with as I've had a few tell me no (some bars won't as its very high cost with a large portion of it being bitters). He was a little bit condescending in his reply saying they aren't \"some bar\" and I'll be honest that this put a sour taste in my mouth at the beginning of the meal. I now had a chip on my shoulder. I wanted to dislike this bartender. But, to the best of my ability, I couldn't do it. He was way too damn good at his job.\n\nWe ended up having about five rounds of drinks, two of which were the bartender's choice. All of them were variations or choices from their menu (generational / historical drinks). All of them were poured well, mixed well, and delicious. The only one thing was different to what I'm used to was that the aviation I ordered was faaaar more tart than I've had before. I'm assuming this is an ingredient ratio difference, no big, it was still good. Our last two rounds of drinks were creations of his own, the last being made with a tasty black strap molasses. Lesson learned: let the bartender pick your drinks here.\n\nFood. Oh, the food.\n\nDid I mention their happy hour has half price steaks? As in 50% off. Whaaaaaat. So good. I got the flat iron medium rare with chimichurri on the side and a side order of bacon+brussels. Everything was delicious. The cook on the steak was maybe 5-10% under what I'm used to but I enjoy it however - this didn't detract from it at all. The chimichurri was flavorful and zesty. The Brussels sprouts were crispy and delicious.\n\nBetween my friend and I we ordered 8 drinks, had two shots, two steaks, and two side dishes. We walked out of there for less than $170 total (including tip!). I was very pleased. \n\nEat here!"

Almost some what completely ignored for several minutes while she was playing with some menus, looking at the computer and whatever else. \nBut after we were seated our server was awesome and helpful, he explained the specials and since we were there during happy hour the steaks were 1/2 off and they came with 1 side. So, the steaks weren't horrible just way too chard on the outside and incredibly pink on the inside. 3 of the steaks were ordered medium well, however they were more like chard medium. However, The pork chop with figs was incredible. \nAs for the sides, the mac n cheese, truffle fries and broccoli and cheese were all really good. \nFor dessert, the donuts were good,  however, the Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e wasn't good at all. It wasn't creamy and the topping was too thick. \nAlso, the menu says that for parties over 6, gratuity is included. However, it is calculated on the regular price menu, not the happy hour menu. Kind of suspect, especially since happy hours are 5-8 and midnight to 3am. I think that is kind of wrong and our waiter didn't tell us that the gratuity was included as well. \nIn conclusion, I'm not so sure that we will be back, especially with so many exceptional restaurants in town with easy parking, amazing customer service, ambience, and great food for the \"happy hour pricing\" which in other restaurants would be normal pricing."

            "review": "I'm not one for writing reviews on Yelp as I think the majority of yelpers aren't qualified to be writing reviews and for the most part are full of self importance. This is my first (and hopefully only) post on this terrible app. Only doing it as I've read too many reviews from people with sh#t for brains.\n\n1) Don't take stars off venues because they only have a small parking lot. Parking is a privilege not a right. Bars/restaurants/lounges pay rent on the entirety of the land the venue occupies, including the parking lot. They are not generating revenue from parking, so just be happy that any parking is provided. Walking 10 minutes isn't going to hurt you, tubby.\n\n2) Don't take stars off a steak house/cocktail lounge for having no beers on tap. If you want tap beer perhaps you should be at a pub. If you feel the need to drink beer at a cocktail lounge drink bottled beer; if you can't afford bottled beer what the hell are you doing at a cocktail lounge?\n\n3) Don't take stars off a restaurant because there's nothing you really felt like eating on the menu. Seriously...you went there Einstein. If I was craving sushi, I wouldn't go to an Italian restaurant, then complain about the lack of sushi.\n\n4) Don't complain about waiting 10 mins to be served at a cocktail lounge. Life is not about instant gratification. If you want your order taken and a drink in front of you within 2 mins of setting foot at the bar, then go to a dive bar. If you want a cocktail that is made with pride and care, be prepared to wait. Cocktail lounges and dive bars are not the same thing. Would you go to Gordon Ramsey's gourmet burger restaurant and expect to have your food in front of you within 5 mins of being seated? No, you'd go to McDonald's.\n\n5) Don't start your review with the  words \"I'm a vegan\"\nNo-one cares.\n\n6) Don't spend 30 mins in a venue and give a 3 star review, then state it's because you didn't have enough time to give them an appropriate evaluation. Why the fudge are you reviewing them in the first place? Full of self importance and hurting a business' livelihood just to indulge your e-peen.\n\n7) Don't deduct a star because you walked in at 7pm without a reservation and had to wait 30mins for a table. Whose fault is it you're disorganized and think you're special? The restaurant? News flash, you're not special. You're waxed mustache and ironic t-shirt are almost identical to the guy sitting at table 3.\n\n8) Why on God's green earth would you deduct a star because the venue is \"too busy\"!?!? Punish the venue for being good at what they do and attracting business...that's the spirit.\n\nSeriously...1st world problems for people who apparently have a 1st world education. Petty complaints for people looking for reasons to be unhappy. Enjoy life; we're here for a good time not a long time, so make the most of it.\n\nHerbs and Rye is a great place; the food is superb and the cocktails are even better. Staff are awesome if you don't go out of your way to be a jerk. Go in with the right attitude and you'll have a great time."

We went for their first happy hour of the night from 5-8pm to take advantage of the half off steak special. They also have a second happy hour from 12-3am for those who like a late night snack after drinks at the bar. We decided to split the King Kong Ribeye between four people.\n\nBefore we sat down for dinner we went to the bar. There I discovered the massive drink menu and had the hardest time deciding on a drink. I need to go back multiple times because there are so many I want to try! What is so cool is that they have drinks by time periods. You can order a drink from originated from the 1800s or 1900s. Under each drink they have a mini description of how this drink came about. I thought that was so interesting and neat. The drink I got at the bar was the French 75. It intrigued me that it had champagne. It was very tasty and I enjoyed it. We also ordered the calamari at the bar which also did not disappoint. I loved all the banana hot peppers they had in it.\n\nWhen we were seated I then ordered the Bee Knees. Best decision of the night. It was gin, lemon and honey. So delicious and not too sweet. I need to learn how to make this at home. As I said before we decided to get the King Kong Ribeye cooked medium. It also comes with a complimentary side which I thought was awesome. We decided on the mac and cheese. We then ordered the Brussel sprouts and asparagus. The meal was great. The steak was good just the right amount and was very tender. We had more than enough and was able to to take it home and eat it for lunch the following day. All of the sides were a perfect size and they were all eaten by the end of the meal.\n\nWe were too full for dessert but those doughnuts sounded awesome! \n\nIf you are looking for a steak house in Vegas you must try Herbs and Rye."

I found out they have happy hour until 8pm and included a few appetizers and proteins. We were blown away by the food. Truly amazing place to have steak and a few drinks. We ordered the bistecca flatbread, ribeye steak with red pepper sauce, New York strip with mushrooms and onions, whiskey scallop potatoes and sprouts and swine. It was delicious. Plus you order your steak according to their scale and they will cook to perfection. Great place for locals or if your traveling to Las Vegas and want to try something off the strip. Very easy to find. Make sure to get there early or make a reservation. By the time we left there was a line out the door!"

He was quick, friendly, checked up on us while we waited for our table and overall gave great customer service. Later in the evening I ordered an aviation.

We enjoyed our time and will definitely recommend this place to everyone looking for a chill spot with delicious food. Despite what others in our party had said in their tacky Yelp review (party of 2 which the step father was spiteful & using his wives account to place a negative review due to his personal issues), EVERYONE enjoyed themselves including the birthday boy, our pescatarian family, out of state family and friends.

We originally had reservations for 7:00PM on a Monday night to try and make it for their happy hour deal. Unfortunately we were running a little behind schedule so I called around 6:00PM that Monday to see if we could push our reservations back. I got the machine but left a message to see if we can change our reservations to 7:30PM. Michelle kindly called back within 30 minutes and let me know that it'll be no problem to come in at 7:30PM.\n\nWe arrived and were told it'd take a moment to set up our table but we could hang out in the bar area. They have an extensive cocktail menu that was a bit overwhelming to read. My boyfriend and I ordered drinks, he got the zombie and I got the blinker. The moscow mule and pisco sour caught my eye, but the blinker was actually pretty strong so I felt like I couldn't(shouldn't) order a second drink. I was constantly looking at my cellphone for the time and at the host to see if he knew where we were (or remembered what we looked like) to be able to tell us when our table was ready. After about 20 minutes we were invited to our table. We settled our drink bill at the bar and got seated.\n\nAfter we put in our order, our server was nice enough to tell us that we were able to make it in time for happy hour (with only 4 minutes to spare before it was 8pm), so we got a few dishes at happy hour price - which is a really good deal for the quality of the food.\n\nWe ordered the beef carpaccio to start, then shared the linguine and clams and the 18 ounce ribeye cooked medium. The linguine and clams and the ribeye were at happy hour prices (which is 50% off). The linguine and clams was delicious, the white wine sauce was perfectly balanced. It was thin in consistency and not over garlic-y. The dish came with a piece of bread which we both used to soak up extra sauce. The ribeye was good, I usually prefer ribeye over because the rich flavor it has to the cut. Our piece was cooked perfectly and was more than enough to share - we found ourselves pushing our limits on the last few bites because it was so good we couldn't stop. The cut was a bit fatty (as ribeyes usually are) but I personally like the charred fatty bites. \n\nWe had planned to go to dinner as a celebratory event and stated that in the reservation but didn't think much of it. Our server seemed dodgy when we were trying to get his attention, but turned out he eventually told us he was stalling for time because they were cooking up some complimentary donuts for us! What a sweet gesture. My boyfriend isn't really a sweets person (he NEVERRRRRRR eats dessert when we go out for dinner) but he could not resist the fresh donuts drizzled in caramel sauce. It was so good. We had a good experience. If you're looking to go, I'd definitely recommend going during happy hour and making a reservation!"

            "review": "It pains me to give the delicious food here such a low rating, but there are two reasons for it.\n\n1. The prices. Without the Happy Hour, the prices here are ridiculous. You can go to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse for these prices and get a far superior cut of meat for the same prices, if not less.\n\n2. The service. Oye. We were a party of 7. Normally, I'm very forgiving of mistakes in a big party. Things are just bound to go wrong when you have that many people to serve. That wasn't the problem here. The problem was that we were in the restaurant for almost 2 hours and saw our waiter 4 times. Maybe 5. He came and took our orders, then he disappeared. 35 minutes later, we haven't received any of our food, and we haven't seen our waiter in 35 minutes. Several of us wanted to order another round of drinks and were stuck trying to waive someone down. No one ever came. Finally, he came with our food and we quickly ordered drinks while we had him. He disappeared again until he came around with our check.\n\nThe worst part is, the restaurant wasn't even crowded when we were there. I counted 7 or 8 other tables that were seated, that was about it. When you've got a big party and you know you're getting a mandatory tip, that shouldn't be grounds to just ignore the group and collect your cash at the end of the night. If there had been a manager going around asking how patrons were doing, we might have been able to point out our problem to him. But there wasn't. Guess bad service starts at the top and works its way down.\n\nTo be fair, the food itself was delicious, which is why I'm still not giving it 1 star. Everyone was happy with how everything came out and all the meat was cooked perfectly. The flavors here are fabulous.  It's a great spot for some yummy food, but I'd suggest never going in large parties or during regularly priced hours."

The flat bread we got as an appetizer was so good that by the time my entree came, I was full. \n\nThe drinks selection, all from the age of prohibition, is also something I enjoyed.

Inspired by the \"speakeasy prohibition\" era and the history of the cocktail in general, along with old school Vegas mob culture, Herbs and Rye incites that mystery mob feel with it's After Hours popularity, and (I'll quote my cousin Jillian P.) \"red felt wallpaper, fake leather booths, tiny chandeliers\"... But just like Peppermill invokes the sentiment of  Las Vegas, Herbs and Rye does too- just not in the way we're all used to.\n\nAnd even if there was a hint of Prohibition Pretension, it would be entirely valid. Gerardo De La Torre, Bar Manager and head Mixologist delivers exceptional cocktails, all true to the original recipes.  A 'bartender' is given the title of Mixologist when he/she has mastered the Classics of the past and is able to create new cocktails while deriving inspiration from these classics and pairing them with modern ingredients. That Mixologist will then take the title of Bartender rather than Mixologist when these abilities have been demonstrated. It's a serious profession, and coming from New York City, I realize that this isn't widely recognized or understood throughout Las Vegas.\n\nMy favorite cocktail of the evening was the Brandy Crusta; Maraschino Liqueur, Orange Curacao, Lemon,  and Bitters. But that's because I told Gerardo what I was in the mood for. ... Chances are, if you're not happy with the cocktail it's because you weren't accurately articulating your likes/dislikes, either that, or you don't know what you like yet! Which isn't a bad thing at all, because these are just the guys to help you figure that out. For example, I'm not a big fan of Manhattans, and I didn't explain this part, but I do like whiskey and brandy so I ordered \"Remember the Maine\"; Rye, vermouth, Cherry Brandy, Absinthe. This cocktail resembles a Manhattan in style- so it wasn't really my taste, but entirely precise in execution.\n\nMy favorite food item is The Calamari, and Im not usually a fan of calamari. It's unique, and not your typical dive bar version, I'm talking peppercini, pancetta, with a zesty lemon aoli drizzle. I really loved this !\n\nAn excellent addition to the menu if you are in the mood for dessert is their Hungarian Tokaji Wine 2005 vintage. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. A melt in your mouth not too sweet Old World delicacy.\n\nService was attentive and outstanding. Thank you Eddie!\n\nHerbs and Rye has emerged as a rare and authentic cocktail experience; an exceptional and exciting addition to the Las Vegas cocktail scene."

The truffle mac and cheese was very good! A friend ordered the calamari and I was not a fan. When my truffle penne came, it was absolutely awful. A few people at the table tasted it and agreed it was disgusting. The server offered to have it remade and the second time it came out better. By the time I got it, my friends were done eat so that sucked but I was glad it tasted better. We ordered the doughnuts for dessert which were decent, nothing special. Overall, for all the hype, I thought this place was mediocre but probably wouldn't come back."

I ordered a steak and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the linguine clams pasta that is on the happy hour menu. A few hours after we got home my fianc\u00e9 started to feel nauseous and shooting pains in her stomach. Yup you guessed it she got food poisoning. Yes, this happens from time to time as I've worked in the food and beverage industry before. I called Herbs and Rye to let them know the situation and was greeted by Christian who sounded scared to call himself the \"manager.\" I told him what had happened and he had the audacity to tell me that food poisoning usually happens 24 to 48 hours after consumption. Basically, he called me a liar. First of all I am a local and have been to the restaurant quite a bit. Second of all, I've gotten food poisoning before and and it only took a few hours to kick in. I told Christian to check his facts. Not one time did he apologize or take any action to rectify the situation. I left my number down hoping they would call me back, but since I am writing this post I bet you can already guess they didn't. That was a shocker as \"management\" was fully aware of the situation at hand. With all the talk about Chipotle and all the sickness going around I'm so surprised that I didn't receive a call back. My advice is to handle your customers as if they are your family or that it is you who experienced the problem. Herbs and Rye was a great place to go to in the past, but as time goes on their happy hour continues to get worse, and the action of management has extremely disappointed me. \n\nThe good news = waiter and hostess were very nice."

The place wasn't packed for a Friday, but that was fine by me. We were seated in the corner booth right away. The server came and explained to us what the happy hour items were. He left and didn't come back for another 15 minutes.....I asked him what drink would he recommend for me and he said the Clover Club. (Gin, Lemon, Egg White and Grenadine....something like that, I wasn't a big fan so he traded me for a lemondrop martini instead). \n\nWe ordered the Carpaccio, Spicy Mussels, Linguine and Clams and the Rib Eye with the Mac and Cheese. After the server put the order in, everything came out pretty quickly. The Spicy Mussels were really spicy...to spicy for this girl. The Carpaccio was yummy!!! I could probably eat that all night, but just a FYI it's not on the HH menu. I LOVE linguine and clams and I felt that Herbs and Rye did a good job, but it was too spicy for me. The fianc\u00e9 was not to happy with his steak as it was cold and tough to eat, so that was a disappointment. Overall, the food was good although I'm sure I had a stomachache from all the spiciness but it was worth it. For two drinks, two appetizers and two entrees for a total of 75 bucks, it's pretty reasonable. The Happy Hour menu is limited, but the linguine and clams was pretty delicious. We definitely will be back to try the flatbread."

We arrived at 6:30pm on a Friday of Fight Weekend not knowing what we're walking into with no reservations. Probably a fluke but we were seated right away. We spent more time on the drink menu because of all the amazing selection. I got a French 1275 and birthday girl got a tiki drink. Neither one of us were disappointed. She got the Mediterranean flatbread and I got the linguine and clam's and just like our drinks neither of us were disappointed. The linguine and clam sauce is on the spicy side so just beware. I wish I could remember our waiter's name but without me even asking to do a dessert for the birthday girl , he told me he was going to bring out to a sweet. Now that's customer service!! What we also appreciated was the fact the entire staff DIDNT sing. It was kept low key and a class act! We will definitely be back for more happy hours!!"

Luckily, our service was on point. \nI loved the ambience in here. Very lively, fun and happy. Steakhouses can be a bit boring and sleepy, but not this joint. There isn't the widest variety of cuts here, but it's good enough for several repeat visits. Lots of good alcohol as well, but no beer on tap... not that this should be a dealbreaker. You could even come here just for the bar. \nAs far as food goes, the 9oz filet + 9 oz lobster tail seemed to be the best non happy hour deal, so we got that. Very good and flavorful. It did not disappoint. But more than that, I liked the grilled cheese and tomato soup starter the best! It was amazingly tasty and I actually wanted more of that! I highly recommend that if this is your first visit or you've never tried it before.\nParking can be a real pain in the ass especially during weekend nights. And be sure to make reservations or you will be waiting a while!"

Unfortunately there were plenty of problems including really bad service and the staff not being alerted that we were coming.

I got my well drink within 5 mins, Cab was poured, then put in front of friends seat..but on bartenders edge of counter?? (It wasn't till much later that I discovered the bartender started serving him white wine, and never gave him the red he charged me $16 for)! It took the bartender another 20 mins to even start making the specialty drinks?! I paid the $50 tab. Other friends (9 total..including me) showed up, so all moved to a table across from the bar. Then the nightmare really began. I made it very clear that my 2 sons and I were on the same tab. They ordered a couple more specialty drinks and I ordered an appetizer and Linguino n Clams (It was spaghetti noodles!) that was covered in shells, and even less clams, that were smaller than a 4 year olds fingernail. Very very bland. Most orders were placed just after midnight. I got my appetizer and Linguin(o) both about 40 mins later. No one else got their food yet. It took almost an hour before theirs started to trickle out. We kept reminding him of my sons 2 specialty drinks, but the waiter would regularly disappear for 15-25 mins! My sons ordered 2 sides of bacon mac n cheese and the waiter promised the drinks were finally being made, and that he will graciously comp them. 15 mins later the mac n cheese is served by someone else, and still no waiter, no drinks. Finally, one son had to leave as the drinks came. he took a sip and left. I paid what appeared to be a modest tab of 27 dollars. It turns out that was just the cost to the \"sides\" of mac n cheese! My other food was on someone else's tab! While sorting this out, another friend is given his tab without his credit card! We spend 20 mins looking for it under tables..everywhere (meanwhile waiter disappears again). WE asked the second bartender, and he said that he picked it up and held it thinking it was one of his customers! Our waiter finally reappears with my additional charges..takes friends card again and places it with billfolds in his apron pouch and promises not to lose it. He brings back my OTHER tab. You'll never guess what happens.. You did! He lost my friends card and tab AGAIN! Another 10 mins goes by before he returns with it! I then confront the bartender about $16 Cabernet that never made it to my friend, and he reruns my tab. The jury's out yet if these tabs ever show up correct on my Credit Card!  Herbs and Rye's prices are outrageous considering the dumpy location. Even Happy Hour prices are on the high side. Some of the foods and drinks were actually pretty good, but way over-priced. I've lived in Vegas for 23 years, and this was absolutely the worst customer service I've ever had..EVER!"

Salt is meant to enhance a dish's flavour; not dominate it.  The steaks are already generously rubbed with a house seasoning which renders any of the \"add-ons\" totally unnecessary. The apps are super salty, the sides are super salty, the steaks are salty.  So by the end of your 3 course meal your mouth is falling in on itself with pucker. We came during happy hour and unfortunately our medium rare steaks were overcooked. But they were still delicious, nonetheless. Service was attentive, the drinks were well balanced and delivered promptly. Even the hostess was really good at her job. My espresso (I am obsessed with the stuff): perfect. Creamy, rich, and had no burnt aftertaste as some espressos are wont to have. If you care at all about craft cocktails you MUST come here. I've never seen anything like it. (Bartender for 14 years)"

The gnocchi was awesome, perfectly cooked with a hearty and flavorful sauce. The Flatbread was very flavorful and was a decent size. I wouldn't order the calamari again, as it was a bit too chewy and there wasn't much flavor. \n\nOver-all, this place has a low-key vibe and is a chill place to lounge, eat, and drink.

The tomato bisque soup was off point, to tangy and not enough cream. The cocktail menu was extensive but the drink pours were very small. If I pay $15 for a decent whiskey I expect a decent pour. The meat and pork chops were the highlight of everyone's menu. Seasoned well and cooked to perfection. The sides that were hyped on yelp.com such as truffle mac and cheese and sweet potato tots were disappointing. I would have given another 1/2 star except for the small drink pours. I also would have given another 1/2 star if the drink prices were better. Overall, a good place for steak and chops but they need specials and an improved happy hour to make it with the trip."

It's been our experience that the word of a local bartender especially in Vegas is one to be trusted and this was no exception.  Herbs & Rye is off the Strip and definitely not a stop for most tourists.  It occupies a fairly non-descript block building on W. Sahara, well marked with signage announcing its presence.  Stepping inside is like stepping into a time machine to an Italian steakhouse 30-40 years ago.  I liked it for its laid-back charm and unpretentiousness.  Still, we weren't there to appreciate the architectural and interior design.  We came to eat and drink...not necessarily in that order.\n\nWe started off with some cocktails and apps.  Herbs & Rye's cocktail list reads like the comprehensive history of American cocktails.  Even if you're not having drinks, the cocktail list is worth a read if only for educational purposes.   I had the classic Lion's Tail ($9) made with bourbon, lime juice, pimento dram, simple syrup, and Angostura bitters.  It was a well-made, tasty drink notable for the allspice notes from the pimento dram.  We shared an order of the fried calamari ($15).  It was nicely fried leaving the calamari tender (as fried calamari can be).  It was a bit overpriced by $3-4 considering the portion size received.\n\nFor my dinner, I had the New York Strip with a side of Truffle Mac & Cheese ($34).  It wasn't a dry-aged prime cut of beef nor was it wagyu, but my steak was cooked to my requested medium rare, juicy and tender enough.  The Truffle Mac & Cheese was cheesy and imbued with plenty of truffle flavor.  In fact, it was to the point of straddling the line of too much truffle essence, as it was the dominant flavor practically overwhelming the cheese.  Service was plus.  Josh, our server, was personable and attentive throughout our meal.\n\nFrom its generic exterior to its dated circa 1960s/70s interior, Herbs & Rye's anti-Strip look and feel belies its true nature.  Herbs & Rye is a first-rate cocktail joint with its outstanding craft cocktails that are well executed and reasonably priced.  The food is satisfying, if a bit unremarkable, and doesn't shine nearly as bright as the cocktails.  That said, I still left fat, dumb, and happy!  I'll gladly return for drinks the next time I'm in town!  3 stars for the food...4 stars for the drinks.  3.5 stars overall."

We went to celebrate my birthday this week and unlike our previous visits, this one was sub-par. \n\nMy husband and I both ordered steaks. I had ordered my steak with the Herbs & Rye rub. Our steaks came out lukewarm. They burned my steak and then piled a thick pasty layer of their herb rub onto my steak to cover it up. I had to scrape it off because I was piled on thick. I didn't want to send it back because I didn't want anybody to mess with my food. Our Brussels sprouts were lukewarm as well; the only item that was hot was the potatoes. \n\nService was a little slower than usual. We were placed in a booth, alongside one of the walls, in the room separate from the bar. The tables were so close to each other that it was practically as if we were sitting at our neighbors' table. I was looking forward to a relaxing, nice dinner with my husband but it was difficult to create that ambiance when when you're 2 feet away from a politically charged group that's very passionate about their views. \n\nI was ranting and raving about this place for months to my co-workers. I've been recommending it left and right. I'm not ready to write off this place since this is the 1st by experience we've had. I hope our next visit is a better one."
