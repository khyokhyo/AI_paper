My wife says it's a classic Italian NY deli and the food is awesome.\n\nI had the grilled chicken sandwich with broccoli rabe (leaves) and it's very tasty.  The chicken breast is very moist and soaked in all of the flavors.  What a good deal at $9.99.\n\nMy mother in law had the linguine with clams, which was cooked al dente.  Not bad, a classic dish, big portion.  Another good deal at $14.99.\n\nMy wife had the pastrami sandwich, very lean meat but still moist and perfectly seasoned with a good peppery taste.  You won't ask \"where is the beef\" as the sandwich is huge.\n\nOrdered the garlic knots and rice balls as sides, as if we needed to eat more.  Both were excellent!  Goes well with the classic marinara sauce they provide.\n\nA great find, as I'm getting tired of the eating places on the Strip, getting too pricey."

I'm only 24 but is it too early to say that that was the best Turkey Sub I've ever had in my life?\n\nThe cheese pizza was good, legit.\n\nThe Americano was so good, I stole my little sisters leftover and ate it the next morning for breakfast.\n\nDefinitely a 9 out of 10. I think the Turkey would have been better if it was Lobster.\n\nBetter than Passion of the Christ.\n\nBETTER than Lethal Weapon 4."

            "review": "Cugino's is the real deal.  Its like I was transported into Queens when I stepped in the place.  Hard to believe that such an awesome little Italian Deli & Market can exist a stone's throw from UNLV in a non-descript mini-mall.  \n\nThe sandwiches could lay claim to the best in Las Vegas.  I'm not quite ready to make that claim 100% but give me a couple weeks and I might be able to.  The meats and cheeses are freshly sliced Boars Head products and the bread is crisp yet soft.  No I know a lot of you're are probably saying \"A lot of places use Boars Head, thats nothing special.\"  Well you're right in one regards but the mixture of ingredients, the freshness of the produce and care put in assembly make this sandwich truly magnificent.  Personally, Im a fan of the #2 Italian with capicolla.  \n\nNot a sandwich fan?  No problem, the pasta and pizza is just as good.  The pasta tastes as if some old Italian mama is in the back making it for her son and his mafioso pals.  Al dente and always the perfect blend of meat, cheese and sauce.  The pizza is phenomenal for Las Vegas.  In New York it would be above average, but with a dearth of good joints out here, this pizza is noteworthy.  \n\nI must make time to also acknowledge the garlic knots.  A great appetizer and just loaded with flavor and grease....a worthy combination, especially when I need a break from studying over at the UNLV library.  \n\nCugino's also has a number of pastas, salamis, sauces and other Italian specialty products for sale besides their prepared foods.  There are a small number of tables if you wish to dine in, but service is at the counter.  I love the causal ethos of the place.  The staff is helpful and you get the feeling they are East Coast to the bone.  \n\nPeople are starting to discover Cugino's but it still amazes me that the Chipotle in front is always busy and people don't realize there is this gem 100 feet behind it."

Wish I would have tried it earlier because of its proximity to UNLV, but will still go eventhough I am no longer a student. Can't go wrong with these authentic New Yorkers!"

Let me tell you Cugino's is a diamond here in the Las Vegas desert. If your looking for a good Italian pastries/pies, Italian ice, Bronx Special Sandwich (fried eggplant,, red peppers, mozz, and sauce), or Pizza this is the place you gotta come too! ----Oh the homemade cannoli's yum!!\n\nThey even have a great grocery store with a ton of Italian cuisines (pastas, meats) you can only find at Cuginos.\n\nThe family that runs the place is very friendly and accommodating, so if you want something you had in New York they can most likey make it.\n\nThese people are straight from Italy via New York so you know you're gonna get some real great food. I highly recommend that if you come to Vegas or you're a local you should defiantly eat or shop at Cugino's over and over again.\n\nI just wish it was closer to Sacramento!"

I would love to try more here from what I saw there, and pictures on yelp, everything looks good.  Large pizzas are pricey. I paid 64 for 3 large, good thing work paid for it. We had 1 veggie, 1 Margarita and 1 special. All were really good, not quite a 5 star, but still good, among the best so far I've had living in vegas, most of my other pizza experiences here have been ranged from VERY disappointing to just so so."

Girlfriend got a bolognese and came out extremely oily asked to get something else without even touching the pasta and they refuse and finally exchange it was 2 slices of plain cheese pizza which wasn't spectacular either. $13 for $4 worth of pizza. Beware of this place, I don't understand the other review here, doesn't add up to me. I could go to subway and get a better meatball sub then this place or go to metro pizza down the block and get better tasting pizza!"

And by reading other reviews, I am not alone in this assessment. \n\nI love this place. I love that several of the customers and the owners act like they're family. I love the deli and the various Italian products. I love that when I was feeling under the weather and craving soup, they had pasta fagioli (and other soups, too) Do you know how hard it is to find a big  bowl of hearty soup around UNLV? Their caprese salad was a bit pricey at first glance ($8.99) but they give you a lot of fresh sliced mozzarella with basil and garlic. Again, where else am I going to get caprese salad within reasonable walking distance from campus? I am sad I didn't come sooner."

Truly one of the best sandwiches in town. I will definitely return and bring some friends."

We both got the Sicilian pizza and a drink. I thought that the pizza was pretty good, cheesy and hearty enough to fill up two starving travelers. Unfortunately, it wasn't anything spectacular and I noticed my husband didn't rave about it either. I would totally come back here though for their $5.99 two slices and soda deal."

We agreed upon pizza and I wanted to try something different rather than dominos, pizza hut, papa johns. Found Cugino's on yelp and ordered 3 large pizza - vegetarian, meat lovers, and pepperoni. When we arrived I noticed it was the same place we picked up from a couple years ago.  Right on, as I remembered this place was awesome. All the pizzas were delcious and everyone was satisfied. I also ate a cannoli which was amazing, as we waited for the pizzas to come out."

I stopped in for lunch yesterday and grabbed a couple of sicilian slices (square slices for those unfamiliar) and a rice ball. Two things that are often hard to find in Vegas.... at least of this quality. I couldn't wait to eat my pizza so ate a slice in the car on the way back to the office and it was glorious. Brings me back to the good old days back in NY.\n\nIf you haven't had a sicilian pizza, you are missing out and this is one of the best in town. They go a little heavier on the cheese than I like but that is typical for sicilian pies. I prefer mine with less cheese and more sauce. After all, anyone can get good cheese... not everyone can make a good sauce.\n\nThe rice ball was great as always... walking into this deli is like transporting right to Brooklyn for me. If this place was just a bit closer to work (or home) I would probably be there a few times a week."

Last time I was here I heard a customer ask about the Tiramisu and the guy behind the counter responded about how his mom made it that morning. They are friendly and have the atmosphere of a hole-in-the-wall place run by a close family. Sometimes I get the strange feeling I am in a movie. It is set-up like how a director would imagine an Italian deli in New York would be. I have tried their sandwiches, salads, spaghetti, lasagna, pizza, and most importantly their garlic knots! I could eat their garlic knots everyday, they blow any other Italian place out of the water. DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT TRYING THEIR GARLIC KNOTS. I would reccommend everything I have tried here - nothing has been less than excellent."

Only reason I knew of this place is because the boyfriend had bookmarked it a while ago. I checked it out on yelp saw pictures, read some reviews and that's all I needed. I will admit some places on yelp are all hype but that's something I like to figure out myself. Not this place. Noooo no my friends. This place is the real deal. \n\nUpon seeing it from the outside you wouldn't think it's an actual restraunt with the blinds barely opened. It just looks like a little Italian market. When you go in you see some booths in the middle and cases of San Marzano tomatoes on the side. They have shelves of Italian pastas, sauces and other Italian ingredients. Then my friends is the display case. Italian cheeses, meats, desserts and oh my goodness Italian heaven. \n\nMy boyfriend was in the mood for pasta so he ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and I ordered the Italian with Capicola. Not sure what number that is. We sat down and the food came right out. \n\nSpaghetti & meatballs - as tender as the meatballs were they had to be cooking a while & the sauce. Oh man. Real authentic red sauce. Deeeelish. \n\nItalian - they are not playing with this sandwich. Piled high with Salami & capacola topped with thick slices of provolone , lettuce, tomato, onion, oil & vinegar. It's served on freshly baked french bread which I think is important and made the sandwich stand out even more. This was so good. You know it's a good sandwich when you have more meat to bread ratio and that I don't mind at all. Next time I would just ask for a little bit less of the vinegar. Otherwise It was so good. That bread. Oh man that bread. \n\nI can't wait to bring my family here. Yes it's small but when you come here you feel like family. The people who run this place are very helpful and friendly. I can't wait to come back and try the pizza and the rice balls and the meatball sandwich. Omigahhhhh I want to try everything ! Lol I  will definitely be back to try something this place is the bees knees ! Believe the hype. It's real."

I am an Italian lover and from an Italian family (by marriage) and I would like to try more of their foods before I give it a five. \n\nThis was the first time I have ever been, which is kind of dumb, considering I have been going to school and working at UNLV for the last four years, and only recently discovered an Italian place near by. How silly of me. \n\nI like the way the place was set up. It had neat pictures and memorabilia stuff that made it feel really chill. It also had like a small grocery store like space where you could buy like 20 different types of noodles and other yummy Italian stuff to cook with. They also had this deli like set-up, displaying the enormous amount of meats they sell by themselves, or make a sub with! Pepperoni, Genoa salami, sausage of many flavors, just an abundance of eye-popping varieties. \n\nSo, now to what I ordered for my first meal at Cugino's. I had the Penne a la Vodka dish. OH MY GOODNESS! Amazing! I love vodka sauce and other then this pizza a la vodka I had in Portland from a food cart, I have not had good a la vodka pasta anywhere. Here though, it was delicious. The sauce was think, but not too thick, and thankfully it was not too creamy either. It was perfect to me. *Doing that kiss the fingers motion (hard to explain in words). \n\nWith the meal you get two bread sticks and a salad and it equaled $15. Which is pricey in a way, but that pasta was so good I did not care. \n\nNow I am not sure if all their food is like that, but my first experience was fantastic and I hope to get back there soon!!!"

The food is good and its cheap eats.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a strip mall, behind UNLV with a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and a Chipotle at the street front.  When you walk inside, the wall is decorated with photos of famous Italians, Italian food items are lined along the wall and shelves, and New York team logos are plastered throughout the store.\n\nOn this visit, we needed something quick before going to the KA show at the MGM.  Aside from hot and cold sandwiches, this place also serves pizza and pasta, and offers affordable daily specials which won't break the bank (and that's important in Las Vegas!).\n\nWe started off our dinner with their garlic cheese bread.  Its a simple starter with garlic and melted cheese on a thick Italian roll.  For our entrees Stephen and his dad ordered the spaghetti and meatball special, which came with 4 meatballs. Stephen's mom and I had the meatball Parmesan sandwich special. It was loaded with lots of cheese, and I could have easily shared one.\n\nThe portions are generous, and you won't leave hungry. Its a great place for a starving UNLV student. As I said, the place won't break the bank.  The total for all 4 of us came to $45 with tax, and we left in a food coma."

When you grab a slice,  the cheese stretches like on commercials.  The ingredients are high quality and well blended.  Got the eggplant one and the garlic and basil were incredible. Oh and don't forget to get a cannoli. They are fabulous.  Best I've had in the states. \n\nAll in all, this place is a gem. Worth an Uber if you're visiting the city."

I also wanted to build my own with mortadella, prosciutto and mozzarella. I mave have confused the guy but i got all this on one..WOW what a snadwhich!! My wife and i split it and it was so filling. The hard roll really made the sandwhich.\nI also tried the bruscetta. It was on a pizza dough and was ok. I like my bruschetta on a crust piece of bread.\nI will definately be back soon.

Seriously, the next time I return, I'm not even going to BOTHER with the Strip at all, because all the good stuff is on the outskirts.  Cugino's is such a place.  \n\nThis is sort of a combination restaurant/pizza shop/Italian goods store - it reminds me a LOT of Trinacria at home (which most Baltimoreans adore).  There's a deli where you can get specialty meats and cheeses, pastas, and other goodness.  My husband and I came here to eat, though, and eat we did!\n\nMy husband got the Donnie sandwich, while I tried a pastrami melt.  Let me tell you, folks, that Donnie is something ELSE, okay?  The mozzarella, meat and vinegar combined into one huge taste explosion that I will quite probably remember for the rest of my days.  It was THAT good.  And the pastrami melt.... wow.  Huge, juicy, delicious.  I have never had any sandwich in my life that I liked more.  \n\nWe ordered two cannolis for dessert and they went down perfectly with the meal.  Really, really good stuff.  Definitely rivals Trinacria here, my Baltimore friends, so you have GOT to come over to this place to eat when you visit Vegas.  If we lived here, this would be our go-to shop for Italian staples.\n\nWe didn't try the pizza, but we overheard our neighbors-in-food raving about it - something about how they haven't had decent New York pizza since they left New York but they finally found it here.  \n\nSo now you KNOW it's good.\n\nThis is definitely worth a revisit when we come back to the area.  Don't miss this place.  The Yelp reviews are on target here."

Many of you may be wondering why Italian's love Mozzarella so much, it's so average at most places you get it.  But once you have real Mozzarella, you immediately understand.  Cugino's makes it fresh everyday, many times several times a day.  It is creamy, salty, and has the perfect texture for mozzarella.  You can slice this stuff and eat it raw, and you will finish it within a couple minutes.  If you've never tried it, go get it now!"

I actually almost shed a tear of relief discovering this place today. I've lived in Las Vegas for about 2 years, and I'd just given up on the hope of real Brooklyn pizza. Settebello pizza is good for what it is, more like the pizza you get in Italy. Nothing wrong with that. But when I've had a taste for NY pizza I've always been disappointed. Metro Pizza was suggested to me once by a friend, and after trying it I immediately punched him in the face. Don't worry, he's fine now. \n\nThe owners/staff of Cugino's are all Italian from Brooklyn. The place is a deli and italian grocery, so you can buy all the best meats, Italian canned goods, homemade raviolis, manicotti, stuffed shells, as well as marinated salads and mozzarella that they make there DAILY.  The sandwiches are just flawless. Even the little things I've missed like coffee soda they had there.\n\nHonestly I wasn't even planning on trying the pizza. I'd had enough disappointments  on that front already.  But as proud italians and proud New Yorkers, they insisted. And I'm SO glad they did."

I've been pleased with every single order. The food is amazing, from sandwiches to desserts.\n\nA few of our favorites that I recommend to everyone:\n\n-Neapolitan Rice Balls, basically fried balls of risotto. I've made meals out of these and nothing else. The Sicilian balls are really good too, but I prefer the meatless ones.\n\n- Seasoned wedge fries. You get a huge amount for a couple dollars and they are the best I've had. Perfectly seasoned and always fresh.\n\n-Homemade Hot Turkey sandwich. My boyfriend would eat it every day if he could. It's basically Thanksgiving on a roll and a little slice of happy.\n\n-Ruben Melt, the best I've ever had. Oh man, now I want one.\n\n-Cannoli. It's obviously freshly made and perfect if you want something lightly sweet and creamy.\n\n-Cheesecake. I'll admit it's not the most amazing cheesecake I've ever had, but it's still damn good. I mostly want to point out that this is the best delivery cheesecake I've found. Most places have sad little prepackaged slices of mediocre cheesecake. But Cugino's has big, beautiful slices that don't appear to have been frozen or mass produced. 9/10, would nom again.\n\nIf I keep going, I'll end up listing the entire menu.\n\nTo top it off, the service is always excellent. We always got the same delivery woman and I adored her. Super sweet, very fast and professional. I can't recall a single order error and even on busy days, service was prompt and quality was through the roof. \n\nTl;dr this place is fabulous."

I must have talked to all the wrong people because four years of university and everyone I asked persuaded me not to step foot into this place. Now I know all of them were selfish bastards who are trying to keep this place all to themselves. \n\nThis Italian deli and restaurant is so diverse that even people with dietary restrictions would be able to dine with few problems. I met a friend after work for dinner. I wish I had taken some pictures, but I was ravenous by the time it all came out. The food appears at a slower pace at Cugino's. Do not write them off. It would be a major loss. We split everything to ensure a large variety. The Goodfella Sandwich is filled with grilled and marinated bell peppers, eggplants, and zucchini. These veggies absorb the aromatic balsamic vinegar well. Fresh mozzarella, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions also come on the crusty roll. I wish they had peppers spicier than a jalapeno or pepperoncini, but it was fantastic. The Garlic Knots and Linguini in Clam Sauce were great, but not as magnificent as the sandwich. We ended our meal with a cannoli. It was not blow your socks off, but anything would pale in comparison to the meal we just experienced. \n\nNow I will go and spread the word of Cugino's like those before me should have. I will not selfishly cling to this shop. Instead, I want everyone to enjoy them as much as I did."

General Supreme Goddess Jaime who HIGHLY  encouraged I forgo a boring Subway lunch for something a little more exciting.  With only 30 minutes for lunch, a person has to really ponder the worthiness of the extra 3-4 miles each way.\n\nIn her most nonchalant way, she mentioned she loved her meatball sub SO MUCH that when she inadvertently dropped a meatball on the floor it was almost good enough to pick up and eat.  My kind of foodie!\n\nThe General also recommended I call ahead but I opted to use their online ordering service via  eat24.com.  (Cugino's has their own website, but when you want to pre-order to are redirected to a Cugino/eat24.com website.)  The online ordering process was a breeze.  I am a web guy and I really appreciate that.  The ONLY reason I only rated Cugino's with 4-stars was it was my understanding when I provided my CC to eat24.com I had already pre-paid for my food.  So, when I arrived to pick up my food I was surprised when the nice lady asked for my CC.  I understand now why they do it that way....If I actually never pick up my food, I could request my CC company nullify the charges.\n\nMajor props to Jaime as when I picked up my food at 12:05pm, there were at least 10-12 people in line.  So, I was able to smile and breeze right by.  The few times I get to feel superior in this world is when you order food correctly and leave the average joe's (hi Terri.....lol) in the dust.\n\nBrought the food back to the office and I was not disappointed.  In fact, if I had dropped a meatball on the floor in our workplace kitchen, I WOULD HAVE PICKED IT UP and eaten it.  LOL  As you can tell my photo, the side salad was pretty huge.  A great lunch value for $11.\n\nI would highly recommend this place, I would become Yelp friends with Jaime (cuz, she knows her stuff), and I would order ahead online."

It is a cute Italian deli with self order counter, large selection of bottled beverages, grocery items and deli meats/cheeses. I eagerly ordered the Eggplant Parm Sandwich and oh, so disappointed! I was expecting so much more from the great reviews.\n\nFirst of all, I believe the joy in eating eggplant parm is that creamy texture of the eggplant and the crispy fried breading.  Both fell short.  The eggplant was sliced so thin that there was no texture expect for the stringy skin and the the breading soggy like it had been fried and left sitting.  Come on now, the pictures for the deli sandwiches were nice and meaty. Eggplant is a lot cheaper than deli meat!  For $8 I was expecting a better looking and tasting sandwich, I left there hungry!\n\nThe sandwich had 3 limpy strips of eggplant with some marinara only on the top with cheese served with two pepperoncini's on the side. I also thought it was odd that the eggplant was cut into long strips?  Why not preserve the natural oval shape of the eggplant and be generous with your eggplant, let it hang out of  the bread a little.  At least your customers would perceive it to be a better value by their first impression. \n\nBy the looks of the reviews and what was coming out of the kitchen, pizza must be there top seller. I will never know.  This isn't a place I'd drive from Summerlin to try again."

Italian?\"  I guess it has to do with how I look and the fact that my name is Vince.  Turns out, I am not Italian, but for 45 minutes last Saturday...I felt Italian.\n\nCugino's is exactly what I look for in an Italian deli.  Pasta and cans of tomatoes on the shelves, a nice selection of meats, cheeses, olives, and sausage, and a couple old school guys behind the counter with white shirts and white aprons.\n\nI walk up to the counter to the appropriate greeting of \"How ya doin?\"  I respond to that question with the appropriate answer (which happens to be the same question) \"How ya doin?\"  The guy behind the counter then asks, \"Whaduya havin'?\n\nWe ordered the Italian Combo#2 and the Meatball Parm sandwiches, a couple bags of chips, and drinks.  The total came to around $20 and we both left stuffed.   The Italian sandwich came loaded with salami, capicola (gabbagool), provolone, and I asked to add some pepperocinis.  Don't forget about the bread, which is the key to the success of this sandwich.\n\nWe will be heading back in our next Vegas trip for sure.  This is a nice lunch option and break from the smoke filled and overpriced casinos."

Nothing was too rich or greasy in flavor. It may look like a simple, plain eatery, but it has a very warm feel to it and you can also eat outside. We ordered so much we had leftovers, but that was the least of our worries because I looked forward to eating those delicious leftovers later.\n\nI like to eat on the Strip for convenience but don't be afraid to venture out a little bit to this place. The espresso was excellent, I must recommend!"

That is  Maryland Parkway in Las Vegas, Nevada. \n\n   Born and raised in the New York metropolitan area, I grew up with sicilian pizza and eggplant parmesan subs that we call heros in New York. Thanks to businesses such as Cugino's Deli and Pizza, I get to relive the remarkable taste of New York pizza and eggplant parmesan subs. \n\n   Cugino's is located in the Runnin Rebel Shopping Center directly across the street from the UNLV Student Union. College students are amongst the many people that patronize this New York transplanted deli pizza restaurant. \n\n  The one thing that UNLV cannot teach is a zest for trying new places. This Yelp's job. When I was searching to find a new pizza place, Yelp led me to Cugino's. Subsequently I dined there two times in the last couple of weeks. On the first visit, I enjoyed their $5.99 two slice sicilian pizza special with a fountain beverage then on the second visit I savored an egg plant parmesan hero on toasted bread. \n\n   When I stepped into Cugino's, the inside put me in a New York State of Mind. If you have seen Greenberg's Deli in NY-NY, it trails behind this deli. When I looked straight, my eyes took in a display case that included deli staples such as Boar's Head. When I looked to the right my eyes saw the counter, deli groceries, and an additional dining room. When I looked to the left my eyes took in a TV, New York memorbelia including the NY Met's logo, and a refrigerator featuring Dr. Brown's soda. When I looked down, I saw my food on the table. I will discuss the in the following two paragraphs. \n\n    When I bit into the sicilian pizza, it was a historical personal Las Vegas dining moment. From the time that I moved here in September 2004 and the preceding Las Vegas vacations, never do I recall eating sicilian pizza. Sicilian is a square pizza that is usually thick. Anyway, since this is the leading sicilian pizza that I recall eating in Las Vegas it truly is the best that I had in this city. Comparing it to New York sicilian pizza is a different ball game. If I compared it to New York sicilian pizza, it is good. After leaving Cugino's and walking toward Coffee Bean, I was determined to return to here try their eggplant parmesan sub. \n\n   My determination paid off when I tried their eggplant parmesan sub on toasted bread. The eggplant parmesan sub on toasted bread was out of this world delicious. The $9 and change that I exchanged for the sub was money well-spent. With the fountain drink (only one refill allowed), it came to around $13. In similar style to my previous visit, I paid at the counter, the man filled my soda cup, I waited at the table taking in the New York deli scene, then a few minutes in the future he brought the food to my table. In my opinion, Cugino's did a better job with the eggplant parmesan sub than the sicilian pizza. The eggplant parmesan sub gives New York pizzerias a run for their money. Writing this makes me hungry as I think about the thick juicy eggplant enveloped with mouth watering mozzarella cheese topped off with red sauce between warm toasted bread. Kudos to Cugino's for capturing the taste of a New York eggplant parmesan sub. \n\n   I really appreciate that in recent years the taste of New York eggplant parmesan subs and pizza is following me to Las Vegas as more pizzerias and Italian restaurants open and Yelp opens my mind to the established restaurants. The upshot is that I appreciate Cugino's Deli and Pizza."

We ordered a cheese pizza, fresh tomato & basil (that came with approximately 8 small pieces of basil, but lots of garlic the garlic, the only nice surprise), cannoli (flavor was good, but it was unusually crunchy and we couldn't get over the texture) and a tiramisu which we haven't tried yet - we couldn't because we are in a hotel room (which they knew, they delivered it to us) and were not given any plates, napkins, a fork to eat the tiramisu with... Nothing.  Even with that, the BIGGER disappointment was how long it took. It was estimated at 45-60 minutes delivery through Eat24 and it took 90 minutes!!!!  At 80 minutes I used the check order status stating we still had no food and their reply was \"We know you're hungry (we're hungry too!)\".   What?!?!?  Really?!?!? Ok, but YOU didn't order the food 80 minutes ago!!!  It's NOT about YOU, it's about an unhappy customer who gave you an opportunity to explain the delay and when we could expect our food to arrive. We received ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Not likely to order through this again. Not happy.  I wouldn't order delivery if you're actually hungry."

The students line up for thick slices of Sicilian cheese pizza, baked Ziti, Italian rice balls stuffed with ground beef, Reuben deli sandwiches, gnocchi potato dumplings, some stuffed with cheese, and round meatball sandwiches covered with melted cheese combined with red sauce. The place is popular. The chefs brought their recipes from New York City. The family styled menu items are all homemade. Every ingredient original from the garlic knots to the bread crumbs used for the chicken cheese parmigiana. The sandwiches are so large that I can only eat half. The second half goes home for dinner following lunch. Police know all the restaurant in town and they stop inside Cugin's for lunch, which is funny with irony since photographs on the wall pay homage to Sicilian gangsters Charlie Lucky Luciano, Tony Soprano next to a portrait of Robert DeNiro known for his Godfather fame. Two of the special house sandwiches are named Tony Soprano and the Godfather. Maps of Italy paint the wall above homemade cookies colorfully wrapped for holiday gifts. Pizza and chicken wing specials are made for large families enjoying football games and college students in the dorms watching sports. Buckets of chicken wings are delivered. Weekends, all the cars in the parking lot after final exams finished were diners at Cugino's Italian Deli. Sunday, instead of breakfast at a pancake house full of waffles, we waited until Cugino's opened at 10 AM for homemade linguine noodles with a little seafood spice, the red sauce was tangy over calamari, scallops, shrimp and grilled abalone served with cucumber and tomato salad with fresh bread rolls. There was a line of customers by 11 AM one hour later and two police officers on a lunch break. The tables were full. The servings large, our family brought bags of food home and ate the rest of the day: Seafood, mushrooms, salad, potatoes, olives, marinated vegetables. I ate the large bowl of Minestrone soup at the table. Varieties of hot soups with spinach, cabbage, rice, and boiled brown beans. I kept wondering how they made the broth since the taste was so original, \"Was it chicken broth or vegetable broth? Slow cooked?\" The soups taste was delicious. The chefs spoke of New York City, where my wife and I met, and the bakers took pride in their homemade dishes as we spoke of baked fresh lasagna, grilled vegetables marinated in herbs, oils and sauce with mushrooms, eggplant, red peppers, white cheese rolls, peppers stuffed with meat. As we spoke they were seasoning the fresh grilled garlic rolls in more garlic, cheese, olive oil and green herbs, I brought a quarter pound of every salad with vegetables home one afternoon to dine on with their garlic rolls. We spoke of the lite rail system the city plans on developing right in front of the restaurant from the airport to Cashman Center stopping right in front of the deli. This is the only deli full of quality in the entire community giving the neighborhood pride. Frozen groceries are served inside so that you can try and bake the pastas at home, especially the gnocchi, but my wife prefers to eat inside Cugino's because these professionals cannot be beat in a Sicilian kitchen. Coffee, hot chocolate, large cups of espresso, my children always ask for the hot chocolate served in large bowl shaped cups of creamy sweetness. Students relax with hot chocolate and sweet cannelloni after class to watch soccer on the large HD televisions in the corner."

Thanks to Peter A.'s pictures/review of Cugino's, I decided to talk the fiancee into picking up a pie.  Half plain, half pepperoni.  In the three years of living in Vegas, this is pretty darn close to being an authentic NY style pizza.  The dough was thin, foldable, and slightly crispy.  The sauce was not overpowering, thin, but had enough flavor to compliment all of the other ingredients.  Gosh, I hate when I buy a pizza and it has clumps of tomato--I didn't order a salad!  The cheese...was perfect, ratio, flavor, etc.  When the fiancee got the pizza home, I even noticed a beautiful grease spot on one of the corners of the box (love)!\n\nI know I've been praising the pizza forever now but, I just want to mention the fiancee's Easter Pie.  While he was waiting on the pie to be done, he asked the owner what the \"thing\" in the case was.  He said it was Easter Pie.  The owner cut off a slice for him to try, for free!  Todd tried it and the rest is history.  Needless to say, he bought a huge slice for himself.  \n\nI did mention in the 3rd sentence of this review, I sent Todd out for a pie (one, singular, uno item).  Well, as you know up until this point that he comes home with the pie and the Easter Pie.  He also bought a meatball sub.  Give 'em (men) an inch, they take a yard.  He said it was good but, too much sauce.\n\nThank you Cugino's for keeping it east coast, and Peter A. for your helpful review and pics!

I thought about it and it's probably because I don't have some emotional connection to the place. The food was good, but it wasn't like I had a cool college memory attached to my slice of pizza. Sometimes food tastes better when you eat it during a special time in your life-- I get it. But for me, it was just pizza. \n\nThe food was good-- the quality is what really made this place stand out. Just walking through the door you can tell that this is a REAL Italian joint. The deli was stocked and they had a pretty extensive grocery section where you can buy all the Italian cookies and treats you've been looking for. \n\nLasagna-- It was very homemade and the ingredients were fresh. You could tell that this was not a lasagna that came out of the freezer. My portion was a little on the wimpy side that night. Kind of looked like it was the last slice in the pan and they had to scrape the sides to fill out its lopsided shape. The lasagna came with a garden salad, again nothing fancy. \n\nPep & sausage pizza-- Ordered a small aka a personal pan. It was very simple. The toppings were of good quality, but it wasn't all that impressive.\n\nChicken wings-- Great flavor, but not something that I would order again. The wings were small and not really a meal (even though it was a meal and it came with fries). \n\nWould I come back? Yes. It was good enough to come back, but not a place that I could get excited about. I love to support local, small businesses so this place will always have my money over Pizza hut. \n\nPlus, I am very curious about those rice balls and the cannolis."

Now, I will be coming to Las Vegas to eat at Cugino's Italian Deli ... and the rest of Las Vegas' attractions will have to wait.  Yes, it's that good.\n\nIf you're expecting a $$$$ experience you can take your butt to the strip. At Cugino's ... it's more like coming home and seeing the family.  It's comfortable and you feel like they've prepared the food how they'd serve it to their own family.  It's like sitting around the table at home.  The flavors here are authentic and the service is friendly.  You can tell by the number of locals that are clearly returning customers, that this place is doing everything right.\n\nMy wife and I ate here for dinner.  She's a big fan of thin crust cheese pizza and is very picky about it ... she ranks Cugino's among the best 5 she's ever had.  She says that the perfect cheese pizza must be perfectly balanced between crust, sauce and cheese and she found it delicious.  I couldn't make up my mind, so I had the #2 Italiano sandwich AND a Meatball Parm sandwich (granted, I only was able to eat half of each).  But, WOW!  I'm hooked.  The Papa Cugino came by to each table and gave each of us a sample of what seemed to be an egg, ham, and cheese bread cut like a biscotti.  I forgot to ask what this was, but it was delicious too!\n\nIn a town full of self-proclaimed \"best this\" and \"best that\" ... we found a place that doesn't have to toot it's own horn ... their customers keep coming back.  In my review book, that means a lot.  When I'm in town, Cugino's has my dedicated business for their excellent tasting food and the heart and soul they put into their business."

I use to chain smoke Cloves at Cafe Copio when I was in my teens and consume large quantities of cheap beer listening to the Beastie Boys at Tom n Jerry's when I was barely 21. The days when I had less bills and belly fat. My Doc Martens and I ruled the world. Great memories were had here. This made picking up this pizza that much better. On to the pizza.\n\nWhen I walked into Cugino's for the first time I was overwhelmed with all of the authentic cheeses, meats, breads, pastas. This was the moment I realized I am not just a foodie, but a gigantic food pervert. This is Food Pervert Heaven!!! Just walk in and you will know what I mean.\n\nFresh Tomato and Basil Pizza- Large for $16.99. Do not make any changes to it. Everything about this dime piece is bangin just the way she is. If you don't like garlic than this isn't the Za for you and we are not friends. I happen to LOVE garlic and this sexy pie is packed with it. Then they throw fresh, earthy basil and firm tommies to the mix and walla. The perfect pie. Don't even get me started on the crust. Let's just say every great painting starts with a fine canvas. I love this pizza.  It's simple and simply phenomenal and everyone I shared it with agreed. \n\nWhen I was driving home with the pie I felt like I had the hottest date in my car. Seriously, the aroma gently traveling from that box to my nostrils made me high and I couldn't stop smiling from ear to ear.\n\nI can't wait to do this dance again only next time I will be rockin out to Violent Femmes remembering the good ole days in my hometown.  Kudos to Yelp (Rex's review) for leading me to Cugino's. Nacho C. and his birds would have loved this food. Mad props to Cugino's for making an incredible pie. All the other pie shops can sleep with the fishes."

I chose the meat Arancini (rice ball) and a stuffed pepper and one slice of cheese pizza. The stuffed pepper was so delicious I wanted to go back for more, but I restrained myself. The Arancini was delicious, and my pizza was perfect, one of the first times in my life I didn't want ranch to dip it in. The crust had a perfect amount of crunch to it, and the slice had a perfect folding diameter, you may need to blot the cheese a couple times, it was a little oily. For dessert I took a box of pizzelle's home with me. It was like Xmas in June. I can't wait to go back and order an entire tomato basil pie to eat, errr I mean share."

It's not because their school is typically rated in the top 50 for hottest studies bodies, or the fact the Strip is so accessible to them, but it's because they can go to places like Cugino's whenever they want!\n\nThis is that Italian deli, or any deli really, that you wish was right by your school or work.  It's about 2 miles from the Strip, so you can either take a brief drive down E. Tropicana Ave and turn down Maryland, or walk that way for about 40 minutes. It's obviously more authentic than options on the Strip, and better yet, at cheaper prices.\n\nOnce you enter it, you can tell it's locally-owned, as is has that mom and pop shop type look and feel. Check out some of the photos others posted, as you'll see it's not just a counter to order food at and chairs to sit on.  They have lots of foods on display packaged up that you can order or grab, like meats, salads, and breads.  I was afraid to look too closely as I would have spent way more than I planned.  For $9.99, I went with the basic spaghetti and meatballs with included 2 breadsticks and a sizable salad. \n\nIf you're visiting Vegas and have your own car, consider heading over here.\nIf you're a student at UNLV and have a break during lunch, just walk on over here. Over, and over."

This is the real thing, and in Las Vegas, that's saying something.  In Brooklyn, Cugino's would be found in the side of some brick building lacquered with 100 years of patina and the best sauce that Nona can make.  In Las Vegas, the closest thing to brick is 30-year old stucco, but inside, the feel is right and the smell is amazing.\n\nHaving eaten everything on the menu (literally, everything, from the Frutta di Mare to the Tuna Salad to the Don's Special), I have some favorites.  If you were to ask me about the last thing I'd eat on earth, it would be the Eggplant Rollatini and Penne ala Vodka.  These two dishes are my usuals for the past few years.  Why? Simplicity.  The Eggplant is sliced thin and breaded, fried and rolled around creamy, luscious ricotta and marinara filling, and then baked in marinara and mozzarella.  It is fork-tender, which is not the case with most eggplant, and about the only thing I've never gotten bored of eating.  Follow that up with a plate of Penne ala Vodka - the best Vodka sauce I've ever had...so good, in fact, I stopped making my own!\n\nOther great things on, and off, of the menu include the Reuben on marble rye, the Don's Special, either Americano sandwich, and the Antipasto salad.  The sandwiches come with a drink, and the entrees come with a fresh salad and bread.  Another note, everything here is made in house, from the cheese to the salads to the sauces and desserts - one exception is the pasta, which is brought in from a maker in Brooklyn who, it was explained to me, makes it as good as can be made.\n\nOne final note, Cugino's is a deli and, as such, has meats and cheeses for sale, along with a large variety of imported Italian brand products, like tomatoes, cookies, oil, Arborio rice and Lavazza coffee.\n\nI could go on, but that would mean writing a dissertation; it's better if you just go grab a cappuccino and a plate of macaroni (Also, why not support a great, local, family-owned business)...\n\nBuon Appetito!"

It was absolutely amazing - the delicious chicken cutlet is homemade and the peppers and dressing add a vinegary mouthwatering twist making the sandwich much more Italian-like than I expected.\n\nI also got a few appetizers wanting to try as many dishes as possible on my first and only visit considering I am from out of state. I got a little bowl of assorted olives as I figured you can't go wrong with them (and I was right, they're supreme saltiness was on point), some delectable fried zucchini (served with mozzarella sauce on the side, delicious), and a few garlic knots (also superb). \n\nThe aura of Cugino's was refreshing, casual, and authentic. The man who took my order was friendly and helpful with my inquisitions. He was rather surprised I was not from the area, making it seem as though most of the customers are locals, however, he was extremely welcoming and excited to serve us Cugino's delicacies. \n\nThere are a plethora of reasons why I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Cugino's; all in all I highly recommend this Italian restaurant to anyone looking for an authentic and memorable meal!!"

            "review": "I was looking for something different during lunch and realized that the UNLV area was surprisingly close. Cue a visit to one of my older bookmarks in the area...\n\nCugino's Italian Deli is in one of those plazas across Maryland Parkway from UNLV. Despite its location, I saw few college-age customers in the dining area and none behind the counter. Even without the New York faux license plates and sports teams pennants on the wall, you could get some of the straightforward no-nonsense attitude from the employees.\n\nYou can also get pastas, sauces, deli meats, cheeses, and other Italian foodstuffs both packaged and fresh. I was more interests in the ready-made foods, which as you might expect include sandwiches, pizzas, and pastas.\n\nI wasn't feeling up for a lunch special on my first visit (basically several normally priced items plus a free fountain drink) so I went with the eggplant parmesan sandwich ($9.99). It's not a super huge portion, but it has pretty decent bread, savory eggplant, delicious red sauce, and really gooey cheese. The banana pepper really went well with this sandwich too. It was probably a bit of a mistake to skip the meatballs though, and I wasn't getting that really deep satisfaction that I have from other sandwiches. I wouldn't say it was worth over ten minutes' wait.\n\nI went back a couple of days later for that meatball parmesan sub ($8.99). I was hoping for a really mind-blowing meatball, but I got pretty good ones that are still unfortunately not the best that I've had out of a small Italian deli. Same cheese and red sauce didn't quite carry the day.\n\nMy favorite part about the second visit was the cannolis. They come both large ($3.75) and small ($1.75). After one bite, I felt regret at not getting the large one. Crispy crust, cold but not too sweet filling, and just enough chocolate. I would possibly come back for those. I haven't had a lot of cannolis, so this isn't saying too much, but they're the best I've had.\n\nCugino's is a decent lunch spot if you're in the area. I would give 3.5 stars in an ideal world (or an ideal rating system), but I was just was too underwhelmed in my two visits. I would come back to try some pizza or cold cut sandwiches if a friend invited me, but there are far superior hot sandwiches in town."

The delivery charge was only $5 additional, very reasonable considering gas prices are so high, this is a steal! \n\nThe delivery lady was 3 min early and the food was very fresh still. Ordered the Godfather sandwich $10, side salad $4, Rice ball $2.50, Cannoli and the Cugino Sampler. The sandwich was huge - loaded with lots of meat, and very tasty. My favorite has to be the rice ball, can't fault a girl for loving balls! The Cugino sampler contains 2-3 of the mozzarella sticks, chicken wings, and fried zucchini. The salad was meh, just some veggies with pre-packaged salad dressing. \n\nProbably will try their pizza next time."

I had Donnie's Special, a huge chicken cutlet on a perfect roll with peppers, onions, lettuce, balsamic vinegar, and mozzarella cheese.  The cheese was the real deal.  Thick mozzarella.  I did a lot of thinking, because I didn't want to be hyperbolic, but I am pretty sure this is the best sandwich I've eaten in Las Vegas, it's between the Donnie and catfish sloppy joe at RM Seafood at the very least.  The bun was crusty at Cugino's, but held everything together well.  And, this is a LARGE sandwich, side of chips not necessary.  The balsamic was an awesome addition to the sandwich.  Finally, very thinly sliced onions, always a good addition.\n\nMy wife had the Cugino's special, which is basically the same as the Donnie's, but with prosciutto.  It frankly had so much prosciutto on it, I wondered how they made a profit.  Another enormous sandwich.  I look forward to eating here again very soon to try everything.  But, I don't know how I can go here and not get Donnie's Special."

A lot of people come here for their pizzas and pastas, which are all good. But what really puts this place over the top for me is their sandwiches. Any of their parmigianas are excellent. Do yourself a favor and get Donnie's Special sometime. In fact, almost anything they put in between bread is worth trying. \n\nMy top 5 sandwiches:\n1. Donnie's Special\n2. Philly Cheese Steak\n3. Sausage, Peppers, and Eggs\n4. Cugino's Special\n5. Meatball Parmigiana\n\nThey also have a section next to the checkout counter where they sell quality stuff such as roast peppers, marinated mushrooms, marinated eggplant, grilled vegetables, sausage, and stromboli. They're all blackout good. Don't forget to try their garlic knots, seasoned fries, and Sicilian rice balls, all of which are also made in-house. They also have incredibly tasty sweets like cannolis and cheesecake, both of which rank among the best I've ever tried. \n\nYou'll need countless trips to this place just to try everything they have to offer, and chances are you won't anytime soon because you'll probably end up buying some of the same things over and over again. Vegas is very lucky to have a great deli such as this and I hope they'll stick around for many years to come."

Nothing fancy...\n\nSaw Veal Parm sandwich on the menu - just had to try it!

I still like this place and need to try more items before settling on a final rating.  \nThis trip, I tried the garlic knots; very garlic-y, but needs either a little salt or a marinara dip to complete it.  Also tried the Jamaican beef patty after reading about it on other reviews here, but was somewhat disappointed.  They're more dough-y than flaky, and the beef filling is a tinge bitter - not sure why.  I love beef patties, so I'm very picky - and what do you expect ordering a Jamaican item from an Italian deli?  (If anyone is in Toronto, Randy's beef patties is much better!)  Ordered the liverwurst sandwich for my other half; it was as good as could be expected for a loaded liverwurst sandwich.  Their home-made bread really makes the difference on their sandwiches!  \nTo be fair, I ordered items outside of their mainline menu this trip, so that affected their rating.  I suspect if we stay with their mainline italian menu items, my ratings will go up again - but that's for another visit.  I'll definitely come back for another try!"

Man. That sandwich was off the hook! The prosciutto was also great, but I went cheap by getting the domestic ($13 a pound). Next time, I'll try the imported ($20 a pound). I was amazed at how full I was after the Meatball Parm and five slices of prosciutto. Maybe because the sandwich came with a 20oz soda.\n\nI wish I knew about this place when I was going to UNLV.

As you come in you see all the deli meats (Boar's Head is what they are representing), pizza and garlic knots behind the glass case, and Italian groceries lined along the walls.\n\nI came for lunch so something hot was what I was looking for. On their menu I see all sorts of hot sandwiches from meatball and pastrami to Italian sausage and several aptly named sandwiches (which I am more than happy to check out the next 20 visits or so!)\n\nI went with my all time favorite, Philly Cheesesteak with all the fixins'. It is I would say about 8 inches in length cut in half. From my pic you can see the melted mozzarella on top of grilled, thinly slice peppered meat mixed with green peppers and onions. Man, my mouth is watering just typing this. As for the bread, WOW! Crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. One bite and I knew this bread was freshly baked here because I could probably eat the bread by itself.\n\nService was great from beginning to end. I came in, ordered, sat down, and they brought my sandwich out to me. From that point on, I didn't get up until I finished my sandwich. \n\nThe atmosphere has that New York/Italian feel to it. On the walls are posters of New York teams like the Mets, Yankees, Knicks, Jets, and Giants. This place is exactly what you find on the corner of just about any street in New York.\n\nOverall, I cant wait to come back and try everything else. These guys are kind of hidden in this plaza towards the back. Once you find it, you will definitely remember where they are from now on."

We wanted to try several things but some of the normal crew couldn't make it.\n\nAfter a bit of confusion on our part about what to order and the idea of mixing sauces on one pizza-spearate for each half, we got our order in and then had a seat.  This is a no frills, small spot.  My one photo basically shows all the seating except for some not seen on the right.  You get your own plastic ware and napkins from a table to the left of the deli case and there are salt and pepper shakers there and some hot peppers and other spices you might want with Italian food.\n\nWe first got fried gnocchi which were OK.  The marinara dipping sauce was good.  Two of us shared a fried rice ball with some tomato sauce and lots of cheese.  It was good.  Next, we had two pizzas.  Yes, three people eating two pizzas.  We got a thin style white pizza and a Sicilian style Margherita pizza.  Needless to say, one of left Cugino's with some leftovers--me.  Andrea enjoyed the pizza tonight.\n\nThe pizzas were both good.  I'm spoiled by a white truffle pizza I'm used to getting so this white pizza was a little lacking.  The Margherita was good with a rich sauce and lots of melted cheese.  We also had an order of garlic knots with their good marinara dipping sauce.  For me, this was the star of lunch.  They had good garlic flavor that wasn't lost when dipped in the marinara.\n\nFor dessert, we each had a cannoli.  Thank you M.\n\nThis is a great lunch place for students because it's right across the street from UNLV's student center.  \n\nI think I'll stop in and try some of their deli salads.  That would be my reason for returning.  The rest was good but pretty standard Italian fare."

I havent seen toasted ravioli on a menu since I have moved here. Everything has been delicious.  We are looking forward to exploring other aspects of the menu, including some things we are not familiar with, but must be more popular on the east coast, including rice balls, and Jamaican beef patties.

Everything from their Italian dressing, to simple breadsticks, and pizza that my dining partners had -- I gotta try more pizza for sure -- all of it is just good. \n\nThe restaurant/deli has a wide selection of fresh deli meats and cheeses, home-made mozzarella and ricotta, and appealing-looking sandwiches that are very reasonably priced, and I suspect, will be delicious when I try. This place is 4.5 right now! Try it, like it, repeat."

Had the most amazing cheese pizza....crunchy on the bottom, hot gooey sauce, and the most amazing cheese! \nMe n' the hubs both ate dinner for a whopping total of $10.80.  What a deal! You can't even eat dinner for that at McDonalds.  \nThere were a lot of old folks in there and everybody was talking to each other (I guess they're regulars) and that's always a good sign.  I enjoyed it.  I'll definitely be back."

My personal favorites are the buffalo mozzarella, ricotta salata, and the pecorino Romano. If I'm dining, I switch it up between the spaghetti Bolognese, cheese raviolis, or sausage & pepper sandwich. And I NEVER ever leave without a fresh hand made cannoli, or an assortment of Italian butter cookies. If you're ordering for a holiday, call it in! They get very busy. Family owned and operated. Good people, great food. It truly reminds me of my grandmas cooking!"

My wife and son loved the pepperoni pizza and I had the Italian #2 with the spicy ham (my mouth is watering just writing about it).  After my son polished off his pizza I gave him a bite of my sandwich and he immediately offered to eat the rest of it for me...no way!  But I did feel guilty about not sharing so I let him have a few more bites (but that's all).  The service was fast and really friendly.  We were on a mini vacation to Vegas and the next time we are in town, we are definitely making another pit-stop here, plus I want to try their Italian Ice as well."

To make a long story short these guys wanted some of the best and authentic New York style deli and Italian food in Las Vegas.  \n\nSo we figure lets go check this place out. I'm proud to say that after about 5 years this is still one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.  And that's not even with me getting to the food.  Julia and her family are the nicest, kindest,  sweetest people on this earth.  It doesn't matter if it's been a day, a week,  or a few months,  they take the time to chat with you.  Ask how the family has been and always have a smile on their faces. That awesome attitude translates into the food.  Fresh sauces made daily,  authentic New York style pizza,  garlic knots to die for,  and those rice balls.  When I first started going to Cugino's they weren't regularly available,  you had to ask or pre order them.  I always get the larger rice balls with the meat inside.  If you are eating in store ask them to heat it up and put some sauce and cheese on top. Everything from a basic plate of spaghetti to the linguini and clams is always top notch,  hot and amazingly fresh."

The frozen bread is well worth the four dollars - especially if you miss the bread from back East, because it's from back East!!! Heat it up and be ready to be gloriously stuffed with the best carbs around. And don't forget to top it off with fresh mozzarella or slices of Prosciutto. The family who owns it are Mets fans but that's alright, I can still love my Phillies and I won't hold it against them because the food is so damn good. I can always go in there for a good heckle and trip down East coast Italian American memory lane. They carry lots of Italian brand sauce and tomatoes, and of course - Wise chips!!!

And I still haven't found it... I'll probably go back and try their pasta but so far I'm not impressed by this place.  First, the smell.  Any good italian deli and/or pizza place has a tasty smell when you walk in.  This place didn't have it and if I was blindfolded walking in I probably couldn't tell it from any other place. Not terrible, but nothing special.  Service was pretty mediocre.  There were at least 6 people behind the counter doing their own thing.  Looked like one of those 'kitchen nightmare' episodes.  I'm standing for the longest time waiting for the guy at the register to stop talking to the two ladies in front.  Then the guy gets my pizza and he asks this other guy 3 times what the total was, 3 times, $22.78 (a bit pricy).  What's my change?  1.22  Okay fine, some places charge extra for take out so whatever.  Granted the pizza was cold by the time I got home but still it wasn't that good.  The crust was soggy and the sauce tasted somewhat like pappa john's.  The sauce killed it for me.  I got the special and the sausage and pepperoni and cheese didn't seem very fresh and the dough was nothing special.  Not the worst pizza I've had but not that great.   I don't get the high reviews here.   I've had better pizza at costco."

It is owned and operated by an Italian family, I believe at least three generations.\n\nThey have some awesome specials that you'd expect to find at a pizza place, and there are also some outstanding Italian dishes. Inside you also find an Italian style deli and shop. This place reminds me of a bodega. \n\nI often go in for the fresh, homemade mozzarella, canned DOP tomatoes, fresh made Italian breadcrumbs, and pasta imported from Italy. The deli has amazing desserts, like cheesecake, cannolis, wedding cookies and even icees. This place is very authentic, with better quality items than you'd find at the local grocer. \n\nThey even do delivery through one of those services; we watched the whole process while we were waiting on our own meal and they were really nice to the older delivery woman. \n\nWe've tried everything from the wings and pizza, pasta, and even a chicken parmesan sub. Everything is made fresh to order. Whether you are going for hot food or authentic groceries, I'd highly recommend Cugino's."

Perfect for the average college student, conveniently located across the street of UNLV with amazing (and decently priced!) food. \n\nMy two favorite things here are the cheese pizza and the ranch. The cheese pizza fulfills everything I want in a New York style pizza: pizza sauce perfectly seasoned, melted cheese that clings to the piece when you take a bite, and all on top of a thin crust with lots of grease (yes you read that right). The kind of pizza slice that you have to fold in half to eat.. That's my shit. As for the ranch, they charge 50 cents for a small side, but let me tell you, it's worth it. They put raw garlic in it, and I sure love me some garlic. \n\nThey have some pretty good specials too (my favorite go-to is the two slices of cheese pizza with a drink for $6.99) and their customer service is always super friendly.\n\nI also gotta say I love the ambiance of this place, from the shelves stacked with Italian brands of pasta and tomato sauces to the walls covered with Italian or New York decor, and especially the family that runs the place.\n\nI wouldn't recommend, however, the white sauce with pasta or the salad. The salad is bagged ice berg lettuce and bottled dressing. As for the white sauce, it tasted like a jar of Ragu alfredo sauce.\n\nJust stick with the pizza, trust me on this."

Although small and unassuming, this humble joint served me some of the best lasagna I've had in years. Simple, yet elegant. Messy, yet comforting. Their espresso was genuine, as were the owners who served us. We were treated to samples of their homemade cheeses and conversations of home, fighting, and naps. It was a refreshing lil slice of New York charm and know how hidden in this bustling desert. If you claim to love traditional Italian cuisine and you pass up the chance to come by this jewel, shame on you.

You see, tonight I got home from work and was just too exhausted to do much of anything. So, I settled on delivery and headed over to Yelp to guide the way. \n\nI ended up ordering a Sicilian Rice Ball, the Donnie's Special Sandwich, and the Garlic Knots. \n\nDelivery: I ordered using the site Eat24, which was easy enough. Because of their handy dandy little timer, I was able to see that my delivery took about an hour and ten minutes. I'm right up the road, so I'm not sure if they were just busy tonight or what. I didn't really mind the wait, since I'm just lounging at home--- but if you are rushed, keep that time window in mind.\n\nLet's start with the knots: they're delicious. Flakey on the inside, crisp on the outside. VERY garlicky (which is a huge plus in this Italian girl's world). I feel like they might be slightly improved with a little cheese or something, but I'm not mad at all. My order came with six knots and a thing of marinara--- which was actually a nice sauce, for the record. \n\nThe rice ball is. . . well, I don't totally know what I was expecting, but it's big (like, half a softball?). Cooked well, slightly crisp on the outside, mushy in all the best ways on the inside, good flavor.  The meat and pea situation in the middle is really great. Goes really well with the marinara. \n\nThe sandwich is the stand out though. Like, the sandwich will be the reason I'll order from here again, no doubt. The bread is flakey, the chicken is huge and cooked well, the peppers are flavorful but not overly sweet, the balsamic is just the right flavor. . . and the mozzarella? Amazing. \n\nActually, I was saving the other half of the sandwich for lunch tomorrow, but now I think I'm going to grab that other half. Thanks again, Yelpers!"

Small in size and curt in customer service it was with admitted indecision that our group approached the Cugino's counter and ordering on-the-fly a six-part meal emerged, the $66 meal presented in four courses with plenty of leftovers and mostly impressive results.  Undoubtedly a red sauce joint despite a multitude of housemade salads and sandwiches it was with fried pillows of ricotta gnocchi that the meal began and with each creamy morsel crispy on the exterior but virtually oilless I was immediately impressed - a trend continued in the tender rice ball buried in house-pulled mozzarella and tangy marinara.  Obviously prone to over-ordering, particularly in small groups, our trio next doubled down on a pair of pies and while the thin white pie proved somewhat bland to my tastes with a mundane crust tinged with semolina the Sicilian dazzled as fresh mozzarella formed soft puddles amidst aromatic tomato sauce bright with acid and appropriately devoid of sugar.  Breezing through a plate of golden garlic knots aggressively seasoned with its namesake herb and kissed with butter before finishing the meal with pre-filled canolli already experiencing some sog it was with a bit of disappointment that I was informed neither house-made rainbow cookies nor tiramisu were available outside the freezer but with stomachs full and leftovers boxed as conversation flowed it would be hard to say I regretted much...except perhaps neglecting the tripe soup or eponymous Cugino's Special sandwich, both on the short 'there's always next time' list, though a repeat trek to similar-but-better Montesano's will most certainly come first."

I actually bookmarked this place a long time ago after seeing someone post a picture of a yummy looking pastrami sandwich, which I knew my husband would love trying. When we walked in and I saw they had pizza and other stuff on the menu I was excited to give this place a try. They had the typical \"pizza by the slice\" sitting out on the counter as well the same thing with the garlic knots. I don't mind when pizza is sitting there and gets re-heated, if it is good pizza it can handle it. What I don't like is when it has actually been sitting there for hours. With this place being located across the street from UNLV, I would figure if good pizza is put out here, it wouldn't last long with a college crowd around. I love trying garlic knots from different places, but just couldn't do it here since they looked greasy and like they had been sitting there for a long time. Bummer.\n\nI just asked for a regular slice of cheese ($2.25 each) and a Sicilian slice ($2.50 each) to-go. The regular cheese slice was almost not edible. The slice had too much cheese on it weighing it down and when I picked up the slice it immediately flopped. No folding with that slice! It just lacked any \"wow\" flavor for me. The Sicilian slice however was perfect. The crust was crisp and chewy where it needed to be and I enjoyed every bite. I'm really glad I tried both because just trying the regular slice wouldn't have me wanting to come back. I don't usually see places that sell Sicilian by the slice so that is a bonus plus the fact that it tastes legit. \n\nThey have Boar's Head lunch meat for sale and a variety of sides. Inside appeared clean and there are tables or booths inside and tables outside. Catering is offered. Delivery is offered."

            "review": "I'm staying at the Westgate Resort.  I researched pizza places that delivered to this hotel and this was one of several.  So I placed my order online, requesting delivery service.  Not having any doubt at all that the pizza would be delivered to my room.  I've stayed at hotels before and have never had a problem with deliveries to my room. So the delivery person called me about 20 min later saying she's leaving the restaurant now and I'll have to meet her at outside.  I'm at a hotel, thus the reason I ordered delivery.  I don't want to get dressed and wait for the elevator and go through the whole hotel to go outside and get my order and then carry my pizza plus two other full bags back through the hotel and wait in line for 10 minutes for the elevator and take it up to my room.  That is the whole point of delivery! And, I tipped!  I wouldn't have tipped had I known they weren't going to bring it up to my room! The delivery driver told me she couldn't bring it up to my room, hotel rules.  So I get presentable, go down 17 floors, find the guest services desk, ask them where the East entrance is, walk through the hotel to find the correct entrance, and go outside and get my pizza.  During the elevator ride up, there's a guy carrying a pizza.  I think, well he's smarter than I am, he probably just got pizza from inside the hotel and is taking it up to his room.  So imagine my surprise when I get off the elevator, and see that he gets off at my same floor, and walks down my same  hallway, and knocks on the door next to my room and hands off the pizza to my neighbors!  I asked him what delivery company he was from (Milano's) for future reference. To make it worse, there are no plates and napkins in my bags - I'm in a hotel! Do you think I have my own plates and napkins?!  AND, the pizza was supposed to have green bell peppers, but instead came with red.  I called the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager.  I was told the manager was not in and they didn't know when he/she would be available because they're very busy.   So, long story short, if you're staying at the Westgate in Vegas, or any hotel, make sure you confirm with the restaurant that they will be delivering to your room."

Easy to fold...(like it's suppose to be)....Fuggetta-bout-it!  I had a slice of Cheese Pizza to get the lunch started while I waited for my sandwich.\n\nThe sandwich came out and was the perfect portion, not too large, not too small.  They use Boar's Head deli meat, which is one of my favorites.  The bread is good and there's just the right amount of oil/vinegar...not too overwhelming like some other sandwich joints.\n\nWhat a great lunch.\n\nWill I return?

There was plenty of prosciutti on it, but it was the saltiest prosciutto I'd ever had. The bread and balsamic dressing wasn't anything special, and the mozzarella lacked the creamy flavor I love about good mozzarella.  That not so good sandwich was $9.00, and to top it off customer service was lacking. \n\nTry this deli if you want, but definitely don't drag all of your coworkers here off of hwy 15 based on these other yelp reviews."

            "review": "Man, I feel badly about giving this place three stars. I mean, look at the other reviews! People seem to really like this place! So why do I, someone who loves pasta, just give it a three? Well, here we go...\n\nWhen I first walked into this place, I thought \"Oh, man, this place looks legit!\" They sell tons of Italian products here, different kinds of meat, and has a ton of Italian-like memorabilia on the walls... kinda like what Applebee's would look like if it were decorated by Rocky Balboa. But, I didn't come here to look at this stuff. I came here to eat. Everything else is incidental.\n\nI ordered the most basic thing on their menu that still qualifies as Italian: spaghetti with sausage. I should note that the servings come with bread and a salad, though neither are something to shout about: the lettuce wasn't 100% crisp, the ranch dressing wasn't really cold, and they were served on the kind of plastic plates I buy my baby cousin. Already I was getting less and less enthused. \n\nAbout ten minutes after they brought out the salad came the pasta. Man, it smelled good! Its the kind of the smell that you have to kind of appreciate for a second before digging in! Unfortunately, the scent of the food was better than the food. The noodles were somewhat overcooked, it seemed, and were thinner than I like (though I do not take off points for that, as that's a personal preference of mine). The sauce was good, kinda... good like upscale pasta sauce I buy at Vons, but not good like an Italian person who knows their business made it. The sausage was good, though not spicy like I was expecting (and asked for). \n\nOn the plus side, the portions were fairly generous and prices were not too steep. The guy at the counter was nicer to us after a few minutes, though he was never really mean... more like he was tired because it was late. \n\nAll in all, I'll probably come here. A lot of the reviews here are really positive, and maybe my experience is an isolated one. But if I come back here again and this place is still a three, it'll be on my list of places to come when you're hungry and aren't feeling too picky."

As per the previous reviews on Yelp, we also got some garlic knots. \nThe garlic knots were fantastic- warm, crispy yet chewy, and covered in garlic butter with chunks of fresh garlic and parsley.\nThe meatball sub had a bright tangy marinara sauce, fresh slabs of mozzarella and a soft yet crusty bread. The meatballs were amazing- very well seasoned with a fine texture. The same sauce and meatballs were in the spaghetti special. The pasta was perfectly al dente.\nThis was our first meal after 4 hours of traveling on the road and it hit the spot completely."

They look like mini loaves of baguette, and they are served warm.

They also have yummy garlic knots!\nToday was a particularly stressful day - I was up til 3AM typing a paper, then got up early for work of course and felt like I deserved something yummy for lunch.  Cugino's has arancini - fried risotto balls stuffed with cheese rolled in seasoned breadcrumbs, served hot with marinara sauce.  WHOA, right?!  I added a mini baguette thingy and wa-la!  Carbilicious!\nThese are super delicious, very different from the truffled ones at Ferraro's (those are more refined of course, and smaller).

Apart from the decent choices of Italian meats and salads, and the freshness of the food, the taste kinda left a bit to be desired. Bread is a major factor when it comes to delis and pizzerias, and I have to say it was not as much as I was expecting; maybe because my friend's recommendation made my expectations too high. I ordered both a slice of pizza and a sandwich, and I found both their bread and dough about average.

I haven't had these deserts in years since my grandparents passed and it brought back memories of what I have been missing. And to top it off the family running the place were extremely friendly and kind. It's and Italian family and they make you feel like it like your apart of it."

            "review": "When it comes to Las Vegas these days it is easy to find flaws...of course being the epitome of perfection as Rex is...it is easy.  Times have hit this city hard. The days of wine, roses and cheap gas for huffing are over. These are the tough times. The rough times. The decline of western civilization times. The times for poorly written and cliched observations.  Rex gets it. Times are tough for all of us. Rex can relate...a few nights ago he did the unthinkable...he ate at Panda Express.  Rex rarely feels shame but he does now. Rex knows that it is awful. Unthinkable. Rex will admit something else. A few days ago Rex huffed diesel insteal of premium unleaded.  Rex has hit bottom...Rex even considered going to the Circus Circus. Rex wept in shame.\n\nDays went by...Rex could barely endure the horror. He ate at Roccos and plummeted further into a depression. None of the usual things made him feel better. Mocking Andre Agassi's hairline...no joy.  Circling cellulite in Star magazine...no joy. Licking the ground in front of Dairy Queen...no joy. Having sexual intercourse with himself...okay...that wasn't bad. Still...it wasn't the screaming ecstasy that Rex has come to expect.  \n\nRex began to wonder...you know what will cheer Rex up...college coeds. Sexy college chicks. So he visited the strip clubs...and was rudely told that you must wear pants to enter. Rex doesn't wear pants for strip club. Rex called them fascists. Rex was beaten savagely by these pituitary cases...these rejects from the CFL.  Rex woke up in a dumpster near the college...his favorite way to awaken. He smelled good food. He walked. He hoped. He put on pants. He smelled again. He rubbed his eyes. He scratched his crotch vigorously. He wrote on a note pad to look for a used antibiotics bottle during one of his \"treasure\" hunts.  He went inside...he wept.\n\nCuginos. Cugino's Italian Deli. More beautiful words were never spoken...except the time I said \"please don't wake up Jessica Biel.\" (She didn't.)  Finding this gem in the desert was a shocking turn events for this depressed cow poke...(that was Rex's nickname...Rex \"Cow Poke\" Marvin...don't ask).  Rex was often told that there is NO INTELLIGENCE AT ALL to be found anywhere near UNLV.  After witnessing an after hours party, and scoring with an 18 year old chick who thought i was Brad Pitt's brother, Stu. Stu Pitt.  I thought they were right....but there are all only 99.9% correct.  The owner and operators of Cuginos are BRILLIANT! They are food genius's.  \n\nGreat sandwiches. Check. Great ingredients. Check. Willing to serve a crying man with no pants. No check...the one strike against them.  Everything Rex has ever had there is brilliant.  Rex must recommend a few things...because that is what Rex does so perfectly.  Donnie's Special is a great sandwich. Chicken is perfectly cooked and seasoned. The fresh mozzarella is the best...more on that in the next paragraph. The Cuginos special is a great cold sandwich...if only slightly under seasoned.  The penne a la vodka is great.  Everything is great. if I had one complaint it would be that most dishes are so delicately seasoned they boarder on under seasoned. \n\nRex promised to save the best for last...much like Rex in bed. They make their own Mozzerella and it is the best in the city by far and away. New York curds made into pefect cheese...and extremely reasonably priced. Rex always buys some when he is there and chews on it like biting into bread. Just eats it raw. \n\nRex understands perfection. He lives it. Rarely can you describe anything in the food business as perfect, and not just for these crumbling times in Las Vegas...but for anywhere any time. \n\nEvery other deli in the city should look at Cuginos as the blueprint on how to succeed. Reasonably priced. Great food and uncompromising ingredients. \n\nRex is your perfect love. You are his perfect fool. Rex will be back to Cuginos. Rex will be back for you...and you will love him for it. Rex will leave...and you will love him more for it. Rex will love the cash he took from your purse."

Their fries, cannolis, meatballs, rice balls, mozz cheese, garlic knots, and cheesecake are all standouts. Their sauces are excellent and are made in-house.\n\nThey have good standard Italian fare such as pizza and pasta, but it's the sandwiches that are their star items, both hot and cold ones. I was even floored by the quality of the non-Italian sandwiches such as the Reuben and the Philly cheese steak. Try them all!\n\nCugino's is run by a hardworking family who just get it done.

The food is still as great and of the same quality as it was a decade ago and I still eat here to this day, which I can't say for most places here!"

Its really a no non sense straight forward deli, order at the counter that has a few tasty items to look over inside of it, racks of some of the authentic product (and some not so authentic) that is used by the joint to create your tasty grub, and an old tube tv in the corner with the Italian soccer league playing for the fans (i am) of the soccer as well as the spot. I met a friend here for lunch this time visiting and ordered two sandwiches a meatball parm and a pastrami that both came with drinks for the price of $6.99 (meatball) and 7.99 (pastrami). Both came out within 5 minutes and good god i was surprised how much meat was on the pastrami sandwich. We traded halves so we can enjoy both and ill start with the meatball and just say this bread is heavenly soft and tasty, with a gravy that i honestly could put in a cup and drink its so tasty. The meatballs were straight forward, i didnt take any special blend of spices or savory flavor additionally as even if there was it was going to be masked by the lovely sauce and bread combo i was thoroughly enjoying topped off with generous servings motz cheese.\nThe pastrami was served on a marble rye as it should be and as you can see from the other pictures provided is at least 1.5\" thick with just meat and its very juicy and flavorful. Deli mustard, onions and again generous portions of melted cheese round out this well crafted sandwich. The service is straight forward and welcoming, almost like a family ran atmosphere and the food is served quick, hot and good so that i have experienced. Best advice my review can offer you is TRY IT, and enjoy the tasty goodness of Cugino's."

Cugino's is one of the few true Italian delis in town, and they have a good assortment of what people from back East are used finding.\n\nYes, there are plenty of popular favorites that we all know: pizza, meatball subs, chicken parmigiana, etc., and there are also some traditional Italian foods you might not be familiar with.\n\nI have an \"old world\" Italian heritage thanks to my mom. Every St. Joseph's day, she made arancini, and every Easter she made a pizzagiana. When I first found Cugino's I was floored! Arancini readily available! Mortadella in the deli case! Checkerboard cookies by the dozen! Frozen sfogliatelli to take home and bake!\n\nIf you've been looking for food like Nonna used to make, or you're feeling a little adventurous, or you just want some good pizza by the slice, head to the University district and give Cugino's a try."

We can drink the stuff.  \n\nSausage, Pepper and Onion Sandwich...Every ingredients were perfect!\nGrilled sausages, (not overcooked in sauce like some places).  \nRecommendation:  add mozzarella cheese and ask for sauce on the side to dip.  \n\nLastly... for dessert Cannoli...love the crispy shell.  The ricotta cream was very good.

            "review": "I have never written a Yelp review, but found it highly necessary to write one for Cugino's Italian Deli & Pizzeria. For starters, growing up in NY and living there about 25 years, I have been fortunate enough to experience a lot of good food in my life, not to mention some great Italian food. Well, I found Cugino's by chance, or in my case, maybe it was the luck of the Irish! So, Cugino's is tucked away in a strip mall across the street from UNLV, maybe a couple of miles from the strip. This truly is a hidden gem. It is the epitome of a family owned east coast Italian deli. In the three days that I was in Las Vegas, I had lunch there twice!\n\nThe owners/employees (all family) are extremely courteous and very friendly.  Checking on me during my meal to see how my food was. Everything is made fresh on site and is truly to die for. It's hard to make recommendations because I had the same sandwich, the Donnie Special (with my own little tweak going back to how I got the sandwich in NY), during my two visits. My GF had the large rice ball the first time, prepared by Donnie, parmigan style, and on our second visit, she had a side of meatballs and a side of their homemade sausage. Cugino's \"gravies\" (marinara or meat sauce) were both amazing. I  actually had Donnie freeze some of the marinara for me to pick up when i was going to leave Vegas and head back to SoCal. If you happen to be out and about or even out anywhere near Las Vegas, do yourself and your stomachs a favor and go enjoy this special family owned treasure. I will definitely be back!"

You can't go wrong with the sandwiches, but always check out their specials.\n\nSANDWICHES: Once had a sausage and broccoli rabe special here that blew every other sandwich I've ever had out of the way. It was that good. The #1 and #2 are both solid if you dig cold sandos, the Tony Soprano or Goodfellas are tasty hot options. Regardless which one you pick, they're all served on some of the best bread outside of Italy.\n\nPIZZA, PASTA, & OTHER OPTIONS: Haven't tried a whole pie, but their Sicilian square slices are crispy, cheesy, and delicious. The rice balls are a good, cheap add-on to your meal. Neapolitan is not stuffed, but still delicious. It's basically risotto with a crispy exterior and a side of sauce for dipping. AKA, heaven.\n\nI've mostly focused on sandwiches here, and you can't really go wrong with what you pick from that section. Go in with an appetite!"

The first thing I noticed was the sticker on the door advertising Boar's heads meats and when we walked in they were speaking Italian, double win! This place is part deli, part Italian grocery store, and part restaurant. Although, I did find the plastic meats and cheeses hanging over the deli counter a bit tacky. \n\nI was initially going to try their pizza, but it looked like it had been sitting all day. So after a quick look at the menu, we settled on the pastrami melt and spaghetti and meatballs. The pastrami sandwich was gigantic! It was also pretty delicious, although I am not sure I could eat a whole one simply because it was so rich. The pastrami, melted cheese, and secret sauce made the sandwich fantastic. I am not a huge fan of rye bread, but I did end up stealing half of the sandwich from my husband. The spaghetti and meatballs were good, nothing spectacular, but good. The sauce definitely made the dish, it was simple but also had a depth of flavor. The meatballs were good, but nothing special. The spaghetti was OK, but could have been better. There was little bread stick on the side and let me tell you it was fabulous. It was crispy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside. So delicious and unexpected! Overall, I would like to try more of what they offer, but I think that sandwiches are definitely the way to go here."

I love coming here for lunch and of course no meal is every complete without a delicious, filled to order canoli."

Some were barely seasoned and tasted so bland, I took a quick bite and discarded it, and some were completely over seasoned. Perhaps it's time to season from a higher distance.\n\nAlso got a small white pie, which is a good price at $8.99, but found it to be too thick and the layer of cheese basically sat on top of the dough like a separate pizza. Also the crust was really weak and that was a major letdown.\n\nService was friendly and did like the interior of the place, but the food was just lacking that wow factor. \n\nMay come back to try one of their sandwiches, since I am a fan of the saltiness, but not any time soon."

It's a family owned deli and the people who work there are great! They remember their customers and make conversation with them to make sure the food is to their liking. \n\nSo far I have tried the Calamari, Frutta Di Mare, and the Spaghetti and meatballs. \n\n-The spaghetti and meatballs was the first thing I tried from Cugino's and let me tell you it definitely hooked me. The pasta was cooked to a perfect texture and the meatballs were quite tasty. \n\n-The Calamari was served in a generous portion and was cooked exactly the way I like it. The breading was well seasoned and tasted great with the marinara sauce. Definitely a favorite of mine.\n\n- The Frutta Di Mare was a mix of clam meat, mussel meat, tiny shrimp, and calamari in a zesty red sauce over a bed of linguine. The seafood was plentiful and wasn't too overpowering, which I enjoyed. \n\nI think this place is definitely a must try here in Vegas. If you haven't tried Cugino's already, you are missing out."

From the pizza (they ship in the water from NY to make the dough), to the sausage (try the chicken and provolone), to all of the sandwiches (the best, juiciest pastrami I've had in Vegas).  Everything is good.  Probably because they make everything themselves in house and cooking great Italian food runs in their family.  I am so happy that I discovered this place.  It has that cozy neighborhood NY style deli feel that is hard to find in Vegas.  Besides all of the Italian lunch and dinner items, they also have some of the best quality cured meats, cheeses, and other deli items that you would expect from a true Italian deli.  I live down the street from this place and I go there several times a week.  I have been lucky enough to get to know the family that owns the place.  They are all very nice and are so good at what they do.  When you eat at Cuginos you can tell that they know what they are doing.  And if you go in and you're not sure what to order, I have two words for you: Donnie Special.  It is chicken cutlets with roasted peppers, fresh home made mozzarella, and oil and vinegar served on a toasted roll.  I like to get it with a little extra oil and vinegar on the side for dipping.  It is one of the best creations I have ever had in my life."

But their garlic knots are delicious-just make sure you like garlic because they are very garlicky! The chicken parm was alright, I've had better and once again I wasn't impressed with the marinara sauce on it. \n\nOh, and if you order take out or delivery, make sure to ask for a side of parmesan cheese because they don't give you any and you'll want some to add some flavor to the bland sauce. \n\nI gave this place 3/5 because I still have hope the pizza and sandwiches will be as good as the bolognese sauce & garlic knots.

You can also buy boxed pasta and other Italian food items.

Not surprisingly, this was a sorry excuse for food just like everything I've ever had at this place.  There was a single piece of carrot, a few pieces of corn and maybe 3 small pieces of what was once clearly canned chicken.  The rest was orzo and salt.

The meatballs were flavorful, and the marinara sauce was decent.  The bread was toasted and fresh. If there was any cheese it was very little. I guess this was the disappointment.
