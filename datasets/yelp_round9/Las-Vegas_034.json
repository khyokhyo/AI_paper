Found this place and we're very glad we went!  While they didn't have a gluten free menu they were very accommodating.  I had an omelette and hash browns and they gave me some sliced tomatoes in place of the pot of bread.  Hubby was lucky enough to have the french toast sandwich which was totally not what he expected.  It was french toast, made from their pot of bread and had cooked apples on top.  When I say his eyes rolled around in his head while he was eating it's an understatement.  He said it was probably one of, if not the best breakfasts he's ever had!! Service was great.  We would definitely go back!"

The portion sizes are good but all of the food lacked seasoning.  I order the country version of eggs Benedict, which consists of a biscuit, sausage, poached egg and gravy with a side of country potatoes. I was so disappointed that the white gravy looked and tasted like it came from an instant mix...definitely not a good quality sausage gravy...it had no flavor. The country potatoes where crispy but again lacked any seasoning. Bottoms line...will never go back"

Been going here for about 17 years,  and the same waitresses are working there.  That tells me that they are treated well and are happy. Our order is always correct,  the coffee is good and they always have a smile on their faces for us. Best place for breakfast in town."

After about 9 this place is starting to get busy.\nOK the food is good but not great. I probably will not be going back. My omelet was to full of feta cheese and spinach, I get that's what was in it at least chops them both up in smaller pieces. \nI will not tell u to go and I will not tell u it's the best food in town. I would have rather gone to hash house a gogo. Now that food has good taste.\nThat's it the food did not have a lot of taste maybe it was what I had to eat. I like to taste my food.\nOne more thing I forgot to tell the waitress that I had a free pot of bread so I told the lady as we were checking out and she was not the nicest. I had told her it was no bid deal but she was not very nice about it. What ever....... And if u post on yelp in another social media place u will get 10% off u need to show the lady when u check out."

I understand if there was a ton of people waiting and I need a big table but it would have been nice to sit and have a cup of coffee while I waited.  Our waitress was a pleasure.  Recommended stuff and was very quick with service.  The food was just ok.  I ordered the hash because it was listed as a favorite.  I didn't love it."

I did pick up a stick or two to chew on while waiting about 20 minutes before and another stick after an awesome meal.\n\nI've ordered their Irish Skillet which consist of corn beef hash, bell peppers, onions, potatoes scrambled with eggs and melted cheddar cheese, it didn't disappoint! I know a good skillet meal when I try one when it all just melts in my mouth, but hey the potatoes on these were not dry but almost light as butter, the scramble mesh well the all the toppings that made it a hearty meal for me. \n\nAddition to the experience my wife's Ruben Benedict was delicious! English muffin topped with corned beef, two poached eggs covered with hollandaise sauce? whats in that sauce?! it was creamy and it added some flavor, the corned beef was sizzlin'! and I love corned beef!\n\nNo coffee this time! but I've ordered the specialty Mexican Cinnamon Hot Chocolate/no whip cream which was good it's almost a horchata, just not as sweet. On the side, I recommend giving their Bacon Ranch Pot of Bread a try! It's a small bread with bacon bits pouched inside with butter spread, very tasty along with the softness core to bite in.\n\nThe ambience inside is like one of those old school diners with spacious booth seating and of course awesome service. Our server reminds me of some lady in the Simpsons because she had that friendly lovely voice.\n\nI highly recommend this spot to do away classy Vegas eats for breakfast time."

The service has that family owned feel where you feel welcomed the whole time your there. Their pot o bread is the best i have had in vegas, i love the variety of flavors and there is always a different special flavor when we dine. So far the nutella banana and the pineapple cream cheese ones are my 2 favorites. My husbands favorite breakfast to order no matter where we dine is the Corned beef and hash with potato and eggs. He says hands down they make it the best in the city. I normally pick an omelet and they are always light and fluffy and taste fresh. The prices are affordable and you get a discount for checking in on social media and you show them at the register. We love this place and it's our new breakfast place when we decide to eat out. I can see why they have so many great reviews and repeat customers."

There are 3 people who I see everytime I go that have been there since before we first went there and they always greet me with and extra big smile. I recently took my wife and her parents and our nephew and there was not one complaint about the whole meal. I was suprised that my super picky fatherin law who is also an amazing cook did not say 1 bad thing about the meal and that was a shocker, he always complains. This restaurant is wonderful, the pot of bread is to die for (if it's fresh) and they are aware of the Yelp, free bread deal, and the waitresses are always so very nice. It is definitely 1 of my favorite places to eat in Vegas."

I say unusual, but in reality I believe there must be a lot of people like me in the world because restaurants like this keep using the bread to draw us in! Their little bread pots are everything I need in life! They always serve the plain and cinnamon and then have a special bread of the day. I never normally like the bread of the days as much, so I stick to the plain. I hate to say this, but the rest of their food is probably a three star total. It's delicious breakfast food but nothing spectacular or different. Come for the bread, get fat for the bread, die for the bread. I just made them a new slogan! \n\nA lot of older people go here, it seems to be their customer base. This is fine, except for sometimes I feel like I don't get good service because of my age. They aren't rude, they just aren't super accommodating. I'm not a teenager or anything but I try to go with my mom to make sure we are taken care of right. Still, love this place!!"

First its packed so be prepared to wait. The interior of this place looks like one of those diners you would find in the middle of nowhere, very run down and dinghy. Our waitress was an old lady who seemed to be somewhere else, just doing her 9-5 so you can imaging the service. I got the country fried steak and eggs with hash browns and a biscuit; my gf got steak and eggs with home fries and a side of biscuits and gravy and we got the free bread bowl with our check in on yelp. First the bread bowl had been sitting on the counter with all the other bread bowls because it was very hard on top and cold so that was horrible, my gf steak looked like it had been cooked in a mirco wave, very dry and chewy (medium rare). On the other hand my country fried steak was great, deep fried perfectly great taste however my eggs were mediocre just your basic mass amount of pre made eggs sitting in the back so again cold and flavorless. The biscuits and gravy weren't too bad, good flavor to the gravy and the biscuits were soft and flakey. Overall nothing special about this place dont see where the hype is, back to Mr Mamas better breakfast"

I'm new to the Vegas area so always on the hunt for a good restaurant.  I had some (southern) family come visit so figured that this would be the perfect time to try it out.  There were 7 of us that arrived around 11 on a Friday morning.  As any great restaurant/dinner should be, they were packed out.  We only had to wait about 5 minutes and the lady at the cash register was super nice.  \n\nOnce seated, we were immediately greeted and got our drinks only moments later.  Everyone decided quickly what they were going to eat so we got down to business.  Our choices ranged from breakfast items to kids meals to the crazy awesome french dip sandwich.  Our food didn't take long to arrive and we were all surprised by the amount of food that came out.  Everyone had more than enough to eat and between the 7 of us, we managed to finish off everything.  The pancakes are to die for!  Kids loved the grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken tenders and the chicken nuggets.  And they all loved that the fries came in a \"frying basket\" for each plate.  The service was great.  Our drinks were never empty and we were checked on several times during our meal to make sure everything was great. \n\nThe menu gives a great variety of choices and we will definitely be back to try something different minus the 4 kids under 7 we were accompanied by originally. Between the 7 meals, 7 sodas/teas and a couple of extra add ons, our meal totaled $68.  Considering the amount of food we consumed, that was a great $68 spent."

My only real complaint about this place is the grits (way too watery) and the fact that many minor issues will come up if you have a special prep on your order (like simple substitutions or asking to leave items off) if they are busy. Don't think this is an waitress issue as its pretty consistent so maybe the kitchen is just willing to take the recourse. They really are minor but then again, I don't have allergies.

The pot of bread was homemade bread that was baked in a muffin ten. You could tell that this bread was  homemade and freshly made. It was very good. The service was excellent and we would definitely come back to Jamm's restaurant."

The waitresses are professional and have a great demeanor. Make sure to come early because this place fills up quick.

At the time, we loved it too because we knew that our breakfast or brunch would take at least an hour of our work day.  The wait and the service usually takes awhile.  On my last visit, the wait was better and the our food came out faster.  But it still took a while, in my opinion.  \n\nAs for their food, there's a big selection of your typical breakfast items.  Price is actually pretty good and taste is not too bad.  \n\nMy Past Orders:\n-Jamms Signature Omelet:  This is the king of all omelets here.  Steak and mushrooms dominate this omelet.  This is all you need because you are definitely stuffed after eating this one. \n\n-Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs:  Actually my favorite dish here.  Their chicken fried steak is tender and the batter is not too heavy.  Portions are huge as well. \n\n-Jamms French Toast:  Their french toast has a different look to them. I always thought that they were over-cooked, but they're not.  The french toast is crispy on the outside and after it's drenched in syrup, soft in the inside.  My second favorite.\n\n-Steak & Eggs:  I had this on my most recent visit and can only say...stick with your favorites.  The steak had no taste and was a bit too dry.  I felt like I was eating cardboard.  But then again, stick with your favorites when you come here.  \n\n\nOverall, Jamms is just okay.  With all the other breakfast joints in our beautiful city, it's tough to say that Jamms ranks above them all.  But if you're looking for a decent breakfast with a lot of options, Jamms is the way to go. \n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (056/366)"

It's sort a place you would want to walk to in your neighborhood, grab breakfast, and read the newspaper. \nJamm's has been a voted favorite for awhile and I can see why. But there is always room for improvement. \nOn the first trip, I ordered the Provencal omelet. It came with spinach, tomatoes, and cheese. The omelet was very soggy probably because of the main ingredients, but it should never be presented to the customer in the way that it was. It looked more like soup. I have to add, I never appreciate places that put a slap of cheese on top to melt. It tastes better when inside the blanket of egg. \n\nThe pot of bread, which this place is known for is a cool idea. However, if they want to make a pot of gold serving the carb in a cup, they need to perfect the recipe. It's dry. \n\nSecond trip, I ordered the turkey melt on texas toast. It was good. Just make sure you ask for dry toast if you don't like it to be buttered up. \n\nThis place is one of the better breaksfast joints in town.

I also noticed waitresses that spoke to customers by name, telling me there are regulars here. Those were all good signs to start. \n\nI got the veggie omelette which is my go to breakfast item of choice. This omelette really impressed me with large chunks of vegetables. They also cooked the onion and bell pepper prior to putting it in the omelette. I really liked this extra step and appreciated it. Having ordered this at many different restaurants, I can say that this was above the rest when it comes to giving me some actual veggies I can see in my omelette. Other places it is just tiny chopped pieces of veggies with no veggie taste. I also really enjoyed the hash browns. The bread that came with it I was not that impressed with. It was kind of dry and bland. We had the cinnamon. \n\nWe also ordered red velvet pancakes to compare to others we have had, and these were different. They were huge, really thick and fluffy, and a little on the \"less sweet\" side which is a good or bad thing, depending on what you want. \n\nService was good and quick.

I had the corn beef hash and eggs, bread pot, hash browns, and toast. The CB Hash is the real deal made from scratch with bit pieces of CB throughout. Eggs were poached and exactly to specification, bread pot was delish!\n\nI was told to pay up front when I was done with my meal and they kept the coffee topped off and offer a stronger blend if you desire.\n\nYelpers that did not rate this establishment higher need to try it again, because it seems they have listened to your suggestions/complaints and have acted upon those making the needed corrections.\n\nI will return!"

We tried the cinnamon and raisin, very moist and warm with a cream cheese icing (I think). It's just the perfect amount so you don't just keep eating bread.\nMy mom ordered eggs and ham Benedict and I ordered a build your burger.\nThe eggs Benedict came with hash browns and my mom was happy with it, I didn't taste it so not sure- she wished it came with toast.\nOn the burger you get a choice of 3 buns, 3 meats, cheeses, 3 toppings out of 8, and some sauce. I got provolone cheese, mushrooms, avocado and jalape\u00f1o mayo sauce. Tasted better than an average burger and I would come back for another one. I wished the jalape\u00f1o mayo was blended. It was literally mayo in a bowl and a chopped jalape\u00f1o in it haha I could've done that! Also I got wedge fries with the burger and these are probably the best fries I've ever had! They weren't greasy at all and I loved that they didn't have salt all over them! Soooo gooddd! \nPs if you post on social media they give you ten percent off your bill, it's on every table so don't miss out!"

Enough was enough but then she proceeded to tell us they found a frog in the spinach once. Not sure what her motive was but in the end she took 2.00 off for the fries.

Menu looked like it had some interesting fair and some variety on old favorites. I decided to go with a Waffle Benedict for $9.99. $2.75 for an ice tea is a bit high, all the drinks were priced in this range. No offer for refill while I ate. \n\nService was quick, and my meal was served inside 10 minutes of ordering. Crispy hash browns were cooked to my liking. The hollandaise sauce didn't have much to it, no taste of lemon or anything. Pretty bland. I ended up squeezing left over lemon from my ice tea on it to get a little bit of taste. The waffle was good, the eggs poached right and the canadian bacon a little small. Nothing that would make me want to come back for but I will try another meal here of something different."

Unlike other places that give you a heaping plate of heart clogging ridiculousness, Jamms has more healthy options. I had ordered the veggie omelet with egg whites and no cheese. That was the health nut in me speaking and then the glutton in me decided that sweet potato fries and a cinnamon raisin pot o bread should accompany with it ($10).  \n\nLooking around there were seasoned customers and I knew this place was a winner. When you can get a bunch of older locals into a restaurant and have them enjoy a meal, it must be good. \n\nThe omelet was massive, filled with tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, and big chunks of broccoli. The sweet potato fries were plentiful and I made sure to eat them all. The pot o bread was nice and fluffy. I just wished with a name like Jamms, they would have homemade jam. Just nitpicking now. \n\nThe staff was nice, split checks were not an issue, and our server was quick with refills."

Waiters and waitresses were super attentive and the choice of music for the place was awesome (a lot of Katy Perry, Adele and Ed Sheeran) even though the place was jam packed, you were still able to hear the person sitting across from you and no one was bumping you or your booth. \n\nWhat did I order? The most amazing skillet ever. It included,  sausage, bacon, the best potatoes possible, eggs, cheese, peppers, onions, all covered in white gravy. Seasoned to perfection and piping hot. Came with a side of perfectly toasted toast (ha, perfectly toasted toast), and I ordered a strawberry covered waffle on the side. \n\nI should not have ordered anything extra because the portions were out of this world. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered an omelet which came with sausage, bacon, peppers and a pot o' bread. \n\nThat bread...  My god that bread. When they offered it, I should've taken it instead of substituting the toast. My boyfriend inhaled it in a matter of seconds. I was barely able to get a tiny piece. It was just that effing good. No clue what they put in it or how they prepare it, but not only was it toasted and flaky, but when you bit into it, it was rich with flavors I can only describe as heavenly and the feeling in my mouth was simply orgasmic in nature. \n\nGO EAT ALL YOUR MEALS HERE."

The menu is massive, which is a personal turn off. Perhaps the reason why the food takes so long to come out every time. However, the staff is friendly and on top of service. Great tips for our waitress each time. \n\nSmall plate options are awesome. Just little samples of anything you want for an inexpensive or reasonable price. They also offer discounts for posting and checking in on social media. It's a pretty nice way to save a couple bucks on your meal. \n\nOverall, the food can go either way. I've had good experiences as well as awful ones in Jamms. The restaurant is old and outdated (this would usually not bother me, but it does make it look fairly dirty). The staff are great, no doubt.

Our waitress was Lorena, she was very professional, she greeted us with a smile.  She took our drink order, and as I was checking in when she came back, I showed her my yelp check in offer.  They have some bread for free.  So I choose the lemon and blueberry!  I have no idea what it is.  It came in this tin thingy, it was really a 1 person serving.  My husband got into it before I could take a picture.  But OMG, it was yummy!  The bread almost felt like it was not done, but it was so freaking good!\nSo I got the pastrami!  Ok, most places that serve pastrami, it's piled on the bread!  This looked like 3 strips of bacon between 2 pieces of bread!  for $10.00  Not worth it!  The skinny fries were good though.  My husband ordered french toast, eggs and sausage.  He loved every bit of it.\nNext time I will stick with breakfast!"

Point in fact for Jamms Restaurant.  \n\nIt was my birthday and I wanted to try something new.  Hubby is always ready to please me and so my Yelp search begins.  After all the nice things posted about Jamms of course we had to visit.\n\nThis is a homey kitsch diner.  It is a throw back to years gone by, but do you know what else is a throw back to years gone by?  Their SERVICE.  I found where all good service has gone.  They have come to Jamms.  Warm welcoming smiles are the first thing you notice as you go through the doors and it continues with the wait and service staff.  Just old fashioned goodness.  Then comes the food.  HELLO YUMMY.  The food is old fashioned, homemade, deliciousness.\n\nI ordered the Denver Potato Pancakes, first of all there is no way I could ever finish this dish on my own.  It is massive and not only in size but in flavor.  I could taste EACH AND EVERY ingredient in this dish.  So fresh and made to order.  I would drive miles for this dish.\n\nHubby and our guests ordered the skillets and only one gentleman was able to finish his meal.  They were big on size and flavors again.  Excellently prepared.  Hubby ordered the homemade bread with his meal.  Today's flavored bread was a Chipotle, Cheddar concoction and it was D E L I S H...  I highly recommend that you order their homemade bread, especially if you are a popover fan.  They are very much more like popovers than a typical bread.\n\nThis may have been our first visit here, but will definitely not be our last.\n\nPS I spied a crunchy french toast whizzing past us.  It looked wonderful."

They saute the Denver ingredients to oblivion, onions, ham and which should be green bell pepper as for a \"traditional\" Denver omelette, they used red. I like my Denver omelette with a bit more crunch of the onion and bell pepper. Way too much cheese about 1/2 pound it seemed, was basically a cheese omelette with some ingredients. It was insane the amount of cheese.\n\nAnyhow, I will be sweating cheese for the next week, eek. \n\nThe country potatoes and cup of bread was awesome, and the coffee is also good with plenty of refills. \n\nI will give them another shot and order something different next time, perhaps the french toast.\n\nI have to say the service was awesome! We had a waitress that was sweet, charming and on top of things! She is one of those that calls you sweetie, honey, etc. I love that and eat it up, she got a hefty tip! lol"

Alas, I went to the Yelp app on my iPhone and found a nearby breakfast eatery that was also averaging around four stars. It literally took us about three minutes to get to Jamm's and big surprise...it's in a strip mall, our third off-the-Strip place that was in a strip mall. We noticed the place was abuzz with customers but not nearly to the level of the Hash House. There was a fifteen-minute wait here, and the diners were not nearly as fashionably attired. \n\nIt's a modest operation, the type that has a cheery hostess and cartoon murals on the walls. The menu is pretty robust, but unlike the nearby Egg & I, there was a lot more thought and care in the execution of the dishes. Jamie W. ordered the $8.45 Reuben Omelet, which was full of strands of corned beef and mounds of sauerkraut. There was also a generous slab of Swiss cheese melted on top and a side of crispy hashed browns (see photo). I went for a similar dish, the $8.50 Irish Skillet, which had the same corned beef accompanied by diced onions, green peppers and potatoes, all mixed into scrambled eggs and melted cheddar cheese (see photo). It was a mess of high-cholesterol goodness well put together. Tasty too. \n\nJamie, in a moment of insanity laced with homesickness for his Midwestern roots, also ordered the $5.25 full order of Biscuits and Country Gravy, which was a gloppy pool on a plate (see photo). I won't deny it wasn't good in a deep Southern kitchen kind of way with the biscuits sopping up all that gravy, though I attempted to re-purpose it as an extra topping for my skillet breakfast. Bloated was the way we both felt afterward but also sated. Needless to say, I also noticed they decorated the restroom stall with the same cartoon murals. Somebody must have had time on their hands. By the way, the waitress was also cheery, chatty and about nineteen. She was refilling my coffee cup with unadulterated pleasure. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...country breakfasts with deli twists, well executed with simple ingredients \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...kitchen cozy with Fingerhut touches \nSERVICE - 4 stars...cheery thy name is Jamm \nTOTAL - 4 stars...good diner-style eats can be found in a strip mall"

Because of all those remarkable \"Yelp\" comments on their corned beef hash, I could not get this place off my mind! Not only that, corned beef hash is my #1 preferred breakfast dish!!!\n\nCorned Beef Hash and Eggs: NO Question, the Best Corned Beef Hash I've ever had to date!! They crisp up the top and bottom of the corned beef hash serving which added a very nice subtle touch of texture and the meat inside stayed juicy, tender and tasty as can be! The portion was also Generous! The accompanied fried potatoes were far from dry, simple and delicious!\n\nFrench Toast - \"Jamms Style\" = corn flake breaded/crusted: 4 Thick half slices of toast that were a little crunchy, a little sweet and had a nicely executed spongy consistency. Add some of their softened butter and drizzle some maple syrup over the bits of powdered sugar.. Yummm!!\n\nPot of Bread: Thanks Yelp for the complimentary/special offer!  Extra Fresh, Extra Soft and Plainly Divine Roll of Bread!! \n\nWorth the Drive, Server was Very Nice and Enthusiastic, Prices were Fair and the atmosphere felt like how it should be!! APPROVED!!"

The omlette part was a bit skimpy & it was bursting with bacon (some slightly crispy, some slightly undercooked)-almost too much bacon but the avocados were PERFECTO! Perfectly ripe and huge luscious slices. Sadly my potatoes were undercooked and very greasy \n: (  The Pot O bread was great as usual.  \n\nMy hubby ordered the irish skillet.  He said it tasted \"fine\" but from my view it also looked undercooked in places and I was not even tempted to ask for a bite as I normally do.  \n\nI liked our waitress-we have had her a few times (I don't recall her name).  I asked about the potatoes.  She advised us to order extra crispy but did not offer to take them back... Maybe we could have had a small adjustment?  \n\nThis is the closest place to where we live.  I think we will put our other places back in rotation for now."

Wonderful, quick service. One start for that alone. \n\nUnfortunately, I think, over the years, they have tried to become something they're not. The menu has exploded with ridiculous, monstrosities for new dishes. They couldn't just add chicken and waffles. They had to create anything and everything with waffles from a BLT on waffles to a waffle pizza. Yes, I said \"waffle pizza.\"  They managed to get a bit of notoriety on the Travel Channel with a crazy breakfast sandwich consisting of a corned beef hash omelet with sauerkraut and Swiss cheese piled on a huge pretzel bun that has been egg battered with cinnamon and sugar then deep fried. Couldn't bring myself to try it. \n\nThe last time I visited, Jamm's had been venturing into exotic coffees and cappuccinos. They were heading in the right direction. This visit, the coffee tasted like it had been brewed through the same grounds all day. I could t even finish one cup. \n\nWe went with a couple classics that we remember being the best in town the Hash and Eggs and the Country Benedict. The hash would have been fine without the handful of chopped garlic that was clearly tossed in right at the end of cooking. I love garlic, but that much undercooked garlic ruined what was once a breakfast legend. Since they clearly switched their sausage to a poor quality, frozen patty, they must not have had the flavorful sausage drippings and fond leftover to make a decent country gravy.  They changed their home fried potatoes to hash browns with onions and peppers. Which would be fine, but then don't call them home fries. Call them hash browns O'Brien. Of course, that wouldn't be necessary as they still offer hash browns on the menu. \n\nI am not only disappointed, but saddened by the changes this place has undergone since I last visited. This used to be a place where we new the crew and they new what we wanted and you could not pick a bad thing off the menu. I think they just fell victim to chasing the \"foody\" trend and lost sight of what was working so well for them. \n\nI hope they find their way soon. Would love to return to the good 'ol Jamms I remember."

I loved seeing those with their football jerseys on. The new paint on the door and Windows is fabulous I love Frankenstein. \n\nMy husband had the California Benedict with home fries. It was beautiful to look at. He said it was glorious. It had a fresh taste but was also rich with their hollandaise sauce that he loves so much. The tomato and avocado were perfectly ripe. I had my usual French toast combo. The bacon was extra crisp exactly how I like it. They have a Jamms French toast or a traditional both are good options but I do prefer the traditional. My eggs were over medium, which is what I asked for. We also shared their weekly pot of bread this week it was pineapple pumpkin. My husband  greatly enjoyed the pot of bread, but it was my favorite but that's the joy of having a different flavors to try every week. \n\nWe love that they offer discounts of you check in on social media or yelp. Our waitress was very attentive throughout the entire meal and we were very satisfied with our experience there as always."

It's no wonder why they've won Trip Advisor Best of LV for four years in a row. If you're looking for an affordable brunch in LV, it's a must try.\n\nCoffee - good. \n\nPot of Bread - lots of hype, but all air - literally. If you must try it, do so. If you don't, you're not missing much.\n\nBreakfast Burrito - delicious especially with all that cheese and potatoes. Lots of going in this burrito, but you won't be disappointed. \n\nFried Chicken Waffle Sandwich - the star in this dish is the waffle. The fried chicken was crispy as was the waffle. The waffle had a sweet and cajun-like seasoning. Yummy. The tomatoes and lettuce tricked your mind thinking this sandwich was actually healthy. Regardless, it's good.\n\nCorned Beef Hash - Different, but good. It's homemade with ample bits of cured ham. It could have been more \"hashy\", so it worked more like a skillet. The potatoes were good, but wasn't integrated well into the ham. Again, different, but tasted good.\n\nFrench Toast - tried the the traditional french toast as well as the french toast sticks. This was my favorite dish. The french toast was made with thick toast and battered and fried to a nice crispy outer texture. The inside of the french toast was fluffy and moist. The french toast sticks were fun and easy to eat. Again, crispy outer and moist inner. \n\nService was courteous and prompt. You get 10% off with Yelp check-in."

Surprisingly, no extra charge for the garden of veggies that the gf requested - but a $1.50 upcharge for the fruit side.  I believe her omelet cost $10.  She proclaims JAMMS is the only breakfast spot that consistently prepares her omelet correctly.\n\nMy ham and cheese omelet ?

Maybe they were having an off day that day, because their menu states the sandwich ingredients as such.\n\nTheir signature salad - the Jamms salad is cabbage, almonds, green onions, and sesame dressing is absolutely amazing!  It's light, crunchy and not over-dressed.  Very very good.\n\nThe corned beef hash and eggs is fatty fantasticness.\n\nTheir chilaquiles special sounded amazing, but was far from it.  It was under-seasoned, and loaded with tons of cheese.  Some may think that's a good quality, but this time it wasn't.  I wanted to taste the chips, eggs, and sauce, and the gobs of cheese made that difficult.  The beans that accompanied the dish looked as if they had gone way past their hold time, with the crunchy, crusty bits that form on the pan when they've sat there too long. \n\nTheir pot of bread is their signature, and they do that perfectly!  It's got that fresh-out-of-the-oven temperature and smell, and when you pull it apart, it reveals light, pillowy, steamy deliciousness.    \n\nAll of these dishes were had over a couple visits.  I'll definitely go back to Jamms, but I'll get something different every time to figure out what's good and what isn't.  Right now their signature items (salad, and pot of bread) are the front-runners.\n\nThe ambience is homey, but clean.  Service is very attentive, and there's free gum at the checkout stand!"

You know that a breakfast place is good when there's a line and full tables\n2. I'll wait for a good meal, no problem\n\nProblem was - the service was horrendous -- and so was the food.  It took the waitress 15 minutes to get to our table after being seated to ask us for drinks.  After we put in our drink order, it took another 10 minutes for us to actually get our drinks.  We spent so much time looking around trying to flag someone down (just with looks as I despise the whole hand waving thing that people do).  \n\nWhen our drinks finally came, the waitress asked if we were ready to order.  As I ordered, she rushed me through any questions that I had.  For example, her question -- \"wouldyoulikebreakfastpotatoeshashbrownsortoast\"  She ran that sentence so quickly, I automatically \"uhh....-ed\" my reply.  When I said \"breakfast pota----\" she cut me off with a huff and replied, \"it has onions and peppers and is stir fried.\"  \n\nAnyhow, she continued on being rude, abrasive and hasty.  But enough about the ordering fiasco.\n\nWhen I got my \"signature\" omelet - the \"signature\" sauce was dabbled on.  I mean, it literally looked like the cook took a teaspoon of the sauce and drizzled it over the omelet and left it be.  I asked for extra sauce.  The extra sauce arrived.  It was disgusting.  It tasted like clumpy flour boiled in egg yolk.  The omelet itself was dry and overcooked.  The steak inside of it was bland, chewy and grey.\n\nMy fiance's eggs benedict.  Disgusting as well.  No other way to put it.  \n\nMy niece ordered mac & cheese.  She said it was really dry and wanted to pour her milk in it.  Serious?\n\nAfter our \"meal\" was over we paid our bill and walked on out.  The hostess tried to give us a discount of 15% for a future visit.  I politely told her she could keep it."

I never forgot it and had always wanted to go in person. We were on that side of town and since the Red Apple Grill wasn't open for lunch, this was Plan B. I had never been inside until last saturday, with my husband. It's a small but busy and popular restaurant located at a strip mall next to Albertson's on the corner of Rainbow/Charleston. There was a short wait- I gave my name. It was about five minutes or so. Not bad. My husband said it reminded him of a smaller version of The Cracked Egg. It was decorated for Halloween. We sat in a booth- I was facing their Wall of Fame- numerous \"Best of Las Vegas\" awards, as well as a travel site award.\n\nThe drinks were brought over to us pretty quickly (quick refills too BTW). We ordered from the lunch menu- Reuben & Jamm's Philly (with mushrooms, and onions)- and split it (our usual MO). Your choice of side- fries, sweet potato fries, potato salad. All sandwiches came with lettuce, tomato, and pickles- cut generously. Most items on the lunch side were priced at $8.50 on average. We both got the sweet potato fries- very generous helping (next time, my husband said one of us will get the fries and the other will get something else). Both sandwiches were equally very good. Not super greasy either, which can be the case with both sandwiches. (We saw a sandwich that was going to another table that was super stuffed- wonder what that was, but I don't know how that person could even open his/her mouth- would have to take out an inch of meat from it. It was that big.) My husband liked this place; he recommended it to his mom and step-dad. I'm sure we will be back again. The staff is warm and very friendly- I noticed that there were regulars here (a good sign). \n\nThe bill was $17 and change- pay at the front counter. Free gum at the counter. On a side note, we noticed that there are omelets named after us, our nick names anyway, and they're right next to each other- how funny. Never saw that before in a menu, so we thought it was cute. Good diner on this side of town, reasonable prices, fast/friendly service, cozy atmosphere, only open until 3 pm."

Over $2 for hollandaise? $2.75 for coffee? Almost all entrees at least $10? Jamms at least makes it up to you by providing a large portion for every full size meal you order. However, on a light wallet, I decided to stick to their small plates menu, which was actually quite a good value. \n\nFor $4, I got half of a Smores waffle, complete with honey, chocolate chips, and marshmallows. The toppings were great: it's hard to screw up chocolate and marshmallows, after all. However, the waffle was shockingly stale. Every bite I took, it seemed as if it was getting harder and harder to chew, until eventually, I was having a hard time even cutting the waffle into pieces. Luckily, the chocolate and honey masked the almost tasteless and stale waffle. Still: not a good sign.\n\nNext, for $5, I chose the option of the Reuben Benedict, a supposed fan favorite take on the typical eggs benedict. It was your typical benedict, with an english muffin, an egg, and hollandaise. This version, however, replaced the Canadian bacon with some corned beef. (Thank god: I eventually tried the normal egg benedict, and the ham was chewy and cold.) For a signature menu item, it fell flat. The english muffin had a strange rancid taste, and the corned beef was lacking in both amount and flavor. While the Canadian bacon might have a worse taste, it at least was a better value!\n\nMy girlfriend had the Bananas Foster pancakes, and while I personally didn't try them, she commented on the poor quality bananas and insisted that the IHOP version was superior.\n\nFinally, my ultimate disappointment was in the $1.95 Pot of Bread. This is the thing Jamms is known for. It's the thing I was excited for, and the thing I had heard so much about from my companions. And, unfortunately, it was the thing that sucked the most. I ended up with the cinnamon raisin pot, but the expanded bread on top was stale and difficult to eat. For such a small pot, I was amazed at the struggle. It simply tasted old, and I wondered how long it had been sitting in the kitchen. The only \"soft\" part was at the very bottom, and there surely wasn't much to go around. The cinnamon doesn't add much, but I shudder to think of how it tasted without it. I also tried some of the peppermint Pot of Bread, and while it was remarkably better, it may have been because of the outlandish amount of frosting coated on the bread. The Pot of Bread may have been the worst $2 I've spent all month, and, quite frankly, the free bread at Outback has far more flavor and is actually consumable. \n\nJamms was a fun attempt at trying something new, but breakfast foods can be hard to get right, especially with such a limited menu. The service was great, but I had hoped for a bit more. Instead, I left wishing I had gone to Denny's."

I wanted to try a place in the same strip mall and I won't give the name because that's another review.  Let's just say they sell poultry cooked different ways.  I let you do the math.  As I was bummed out driving I see a window blasted with \"Best of Vegas\" stickers.  I was about to eat my foot so we decided to stop in to the breakfast/lunch establishment.  As we were walking in I noted the best of stickers were kind of old.  I figured well it can't be that bad.  \n\nWe walked in  and were immediately greeted.  If I were to base the review only on the service and how friendly the employees are, then I would give it more stars.  The waitress was friendly and the guy who was filling our drinks was even more friendly.  Our 1 year old was a little fussy because she was probably hungry too.  They noticed this and brought us some crackers.  This was great!  If you are a waiter or waitress and notice a fussy kid and you know the little things that help parents then you instantly max out your tip.  Just a little piece of advise, go ahead and write that down.  \n\nLet's take a look at the food.  I ordered the Jamm's omelet.  It had steak in it covered with a sauce.  When I looked at the steak and keep in mind I am not expecting fillet Mignon here it looked like the steak um's meat you get in your freezer aisle.  I didn't like it at all.  I think I really didn't like it because the omelet was about $10.  I guess I was just expecting more.  I did get the pot bread and it was really good.  My wife ordered the french toast and she thought it was tasty.  My daughters just at eggs and toast.  We emerged from the restaurant paying $30 for breakfast.  Ouch!  Overall I am sure at one time this place was great but as new restaurants opened it probably took away from this place.  There are a lot better breakfast places out there. Cheers!"

Knick-knacks and country sayings adorn the walls, and the staff treats you like you're in their house. Try the Texas Omelette (with chili con carne and cheddar cheese) or if you're daring, the White Castle Omelette (with ground beef and grilled onions -- yes, like a Slider!). They're famous for their \"pots of bread.\" It's soft and doughy, and if you order the Cinnamon Raisin pot of bread, it's like eating a cinnamon roll.\n\nThey also have lunch items, which I'm sure I'll try someday, when I can get past the breakfast pages without choosing something."

From the host to the waiter and even the bus boys and runners, everyone and everything was great. \n\nWhen my wife and I arrived we almost shied away from eating here because it looked very busy; there was a small group of people outside even. But that group disappeared fast so we went on in. We were greeted quickly, had our name taken down by the hostess and were seated in probably less than 10 minutes. Shortly after, we were brought some water. A few minutes after that our waitress came and grabbed our orders. I mentioned we had a coupon from Yelp for a free pot of bread for checking in. I showed her my phone and she returned a minute later with the orange cranberry version, which was really good; fresh and still warm. \n\nFor our orders, my wife got an omelette, hash browns and some toast. I got the Hungry Lion breakfast which is your standard breakfast platter of 2 eggs, 2 sausage links, 2  pieces  of bacon, 2 pancakes and a big slice of ham (bonus points for putting the butter for the pancakes in a little cup and not glopping it onto the cakes themselves). We also shared a french press of coffee which they brought out before the food. Again, everything was great. Coffee, food, everything. And it's all super inexpensive! For the two of us we spent less than $25. You can also get an extra 10% off if you show the hostess that you checked in on Yelp. \n\nI made sure to tip the waitress really well, she deserved it. Overall, you can't ask for better service, better food, and better prices."

It's nice to know that I've got options if I don't want a Grand Slam breakfast from Dennys. \n\nMy husband and I came here for one of our Sunday breakfasts. I'm a fan of Corned Beef Hash so when I read Russ V's review on it I decided to give it a try. I liked this corn beef because it wasn't salty and I knew it was fresh because it didn't have the mushy consistency that canned corned beef has. My order came with scrambled eggs, and house fries with a side of sourdough bread. I'm a little weird when it comes to breakfast I usually will put the eggs and the corned beef hash on the toast. Once the toast runs out I save the rest and take it home. Corned beef on top of white rice is yummy! The portions are huge here so there is enough for like three small meals! I was also very full because before the meal came out we had the free Cinnamon Pot bread. Just mention Yelp and you too can get a free one! It was slightly salty on the top but once you get inside the bread it's nice and soft. It's tastes really good with coffee. \n\nMy husband had the Sandy Omelet that comes with bacon, tomato, avocado, sour cream and cheddar cheese. I sampled the omelet and it was really good too! It reminded me of the Cracked Egg's North Shore Scramble but in a Omelet."

That is excellent customer service and really shows they care about the experience of their customers. \n\nWe came back and the experience was better. We both ordered something different this time. I had the Wild West Burger and she had the French Toast. The burger was cooked as I liked it at. The chili that came with it was good. I tried the french toast and it was cooked great!\n\nHere's what I've found in my two experiences here: They have a wonderful staff who are friendly and seem dedicated to customer service. The food is cooked very well. Everything is cooked exactly how it should be. But my problem is the food does not wow me. There isn't any thing unique or special about it. The food isn't bad, it's just not something worth 4 or 5 stars."

I love this mom n' pop restaurant...quaint interior with dated decor that makes you feel at home. \n\nIn terms of service and food, I prefer this place over other breakfast places like Egg & I, Egg Works, Original Pancake House, Cracked Egg, and so forth. It's definitely not a healthy breakfast and can be slightly heavy for some but I still like its tasty home cooking. Service can be hit-or-miss with some servers being very attentive while some completely forgetting your existence. Either way, all servers are super friendly and their uplifting spirit will help you start your day on a bright note. \n\nMy favorite is Jamms signature omelet ($9.99) which comes with sliced steak, onion, mushroom and cheese topped with bearnaise sauce. I have no idea what bearnaise sauce is but based on Google search, it's a sauce made with butter, egg yolk and wine vinegar. I thought it was similar to gravy but it was more fragrant because of herbs. Tip is to ask for sauce on the side because they give you a lot. This omelet is meaty, cheesy and filling, easily my top favorite here. \n\nFrench dip ($9.99) is another meaty/filling dish that comes with generous slices of roast beef. These slices of beef are in stack of three to four and comes in a hero roll. Their au jus was little different from what I had expected and almost felt like it was a french onion soup. I was surprised that I actually liked the sandwich without dipping in their au jus. \n\nPhilly cheese steak ($9.79) is nothing special here. I wouldn't order this unless you are craving philly cheese steak. \n\nPot of bread is free with Yelp chek-in. You can get the original, cinnamon raisin or special of the week. On my recent visit, I redeemed my check-in offer for their peaches and cream pot of bread. Bread itself was doughy and had small chunks of peaches inside. Cream cheese was provided on the side. \n\nInarguably one of the best breakfast joint in town. I hope to keep coming back here for many years ahead."

I tried a bite and they were delicious.  The pancakes were light, airy and chocolatey.  I was surprised they weren't overly sweet.\n\nI ordered the french toast with strawberries.  It was very good with fresh strawberries instead of limp soggy thawed berries and they were plentiful.  The french toast is drudged in crushed cornflakes so they had a nice bite to them and no soggy bread.\n\nMy husband ordered the corn beef  hash, this is where they lost two stars.  What arrived looked like browned sliced pieces of lunchmeat.  He told me it was so salty he couldn't even taste anything else.  To make sure he wasn't being overly dramatic, I had a small taste.  OMG it was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten and I like salt.  I drank my entire drink after that small bite.  It literally tasted like someone spilled the entire salt container in the hash and fried my taste buds, glad I was done with my french toast.  \n\nBottom line, don't go anywhere near that hash if you have functional taste buds and anything but perfect blood pressure.  Get the french toast."

Guests get their choice of hash browns or home fries and a bread selection - English muffin, toast, their signature pot o'bread. I chose the home fries and the special of the day pot o'bread with cream cheese frosting. \n\nThe long and short of it is that we both left stuffed and happy, several wait staff wished us a good day and that we'd be back soon.

I also got the Pot of Bread, which is on the house with a Yelp check-in, free carbs!\n\nThe skillet is huge and a very heavy meal that's perfect for sharing or that horrendous hangover that just won't seem to go away.

The service was prompt and the staff was polite and helpful.  I had a standard sausage and egg breakfast which isn't too exciting. But being gluten intolerant I don't have a lot of choices that aren't some combination of meat, eggs and potatoes.  Still, it was well done and the server let me make substitutions for the bread item.  My wife had the chicken fried steak and eggs, and a \"Orange Creamcicle\" bread pot.  I was jealous because the bread pot looked like it would be really good.  Additionally she said the entire meal was delicious.  If you don't have to pick and choose like I do, their menu has a huge variety of choices.  Since they were mostly bread items I didn't spend much time with it, but they had an insert menu that offered small portions for less money so you can sample a large variety of their offerings without ordering multiple meals or eating off someone else's plate.  For the sake of the review I should have paid more attention to exactly what they called it, but this would be a good place to go to sample a variety of breakfast offerings."

We were seated quickly and the server was there right away to get our drink order. There are many interesting options on the menu, but we decided on the classics. I got the pancake special which comes with pancakes, bacon or sausage, and I eggs. When I asked, they had no problem swapping out the eggs for hash browns. The pancakes were very thick and fluffy, easily the best part of the dish. The bacon was decent sized and just the right crispness. I could have used a little more crispiness on the hash browns, but they were pretty good. My boyfriend got the more super sized version which also came with sausage and a ham steak. The ham steak was average sized, cooked nicely. We got a free pot of break with check-in. We got the weekly special which was rainbow sprinkles. It was soft, flaky, and delicious. This is a great spot for breakfast!"

So hit up some friends, and they said we had to try Jamms out. And so we did. Well worth it. \n\nIn a strip mall, and perfect size. Also very popular! So recommended times to show up, try around 8:30, after 9 you have a 15 min wait. which is well worth it. The decor is fun and light. The staff is incredibly nice, which was awesome. The menu has a lot to chose from, which can be hard to chose from. LOL.. I got the chicken freid steak, which was delicious, and the girlfriend got the multi grain pancakes, which where awesome, I had a few bites and was hooked. The second time we went there I ordered the jamms french toast, which is french toast covered in con flakes, it was awesome.. The girlfriend loved the multi grain pancakes so much, she got that again. Fresh coffee, and the staff was on top of refilling the cups non stop. Bottom line, its the local spot for breakfast. So if youre looking for a pretty cheap and quick breakfast, hit up Jamms!!!"

There isnt much in waiting area and I hate creating a clusterfuck in front of the hostess booth where people are trying to ojt their name and check out. it was too cold to hang outside so we left our number with them to sit in the car instead.\n\nWe decided to share\n\nRueben Benedict -I was expecting more like chunky pieces of corned beef but they use deli cut for this but guess that makes sense too. Overall solid Benedict as the Hollandaise was perfectly done.  We got their home froed potatoes which was pretty good flavor with peppers and onions. Only I might ask to get a bit of it crisped up next time.  \n\nJamms Signature Omelette - this isn't the fluffiest of omeletttes and is stiffer but still good. This has onions, mushrooms, peppers, steak and cheese in it topped with bernaise. It wasn't plentiful on the thin sliced steak (think like philly cheese or gyro), but all the components were decent. We also got home fried potatoes with this and this comes with a bread choice.  \n\nSeeing as they are famous for potted bread we chose that.  They always have plain or cinnamon and rotate a flavor of the week. Vanilla caramel was this weeks which soinds like everything we liked. It is similar to brioche crisp on the top and fluffy inside and theu fave us a whipped butter frosting like spread.  Yeah,  Im a fan of the bread.  \n\nService was always friendly, and definitely on top of things. They are quite speedy here, our food was out in no time and drinks refilled stat. \n\nI can see why people like this place.  Its solid, no frills American hearty portioned breakfast with good service. I'll be back if I ever wake up early enough again."

My server asked the drink provider to give us more water and he displayed an action of not wanting to do it. I get that it is a job but the people eating should not feel in easy or insecure while waiting for their food. In addition all of the staring eyes as we were sitting here did not make jamms to feel like the homey vibe I am used to. Customer service is my number one priority. I can eat anywhere it is the workers that make this experience and it was not a great customer service experience. I felt singled out and the center of their work gossip.

Bridges of Madison County meets sponge paint meets truck stop.  Once you get over the momentary shock of that, you know you're at a place that feels like home.\nThe menu has a lengthy omelette menu which includes the likes of a White Castle omelette. Being from Chicago, I was filled with warm fuzzies.  I settled on the house special omelette, which was steak, onions, sauteed mushrooms and provolone cheese.  The omelettes are done just like I happen to like them, with thin egg wrapped around sauteed yummies in the middle.  The bread in a pot was a nifty surprise as well.

I later had the burrito for a snack. A big menu of breakfast and lunch choices anyone would appreciate. Certainly worth the ride from The Strip, if you're visiting."

We were on our way to jamms. I didn't expect much but when we came it the place was packed but we were seated within 10 minutes. Great menu with great prices. I got the hungry lion breakfast. 2 eggs 2 bacon 2 sausage and ham 2 pancakes.  It was amazing. Best pancakes ever.  Also the potted bread it out of this world good.  So if you're looking for s place away from the strip for breakfast I would highly recommend Jamms"

Not what I had in mind after reading the reviews.\n\nThe waitress was very sweet but her service did not continue to the front of the restaurant. The cashier was not polite. She refused to give me a receipt that showed paid for my cash transaction. I do not think this is standard practice of restaurant sales. Why would she not be able to give me a receipt showing paid in cash? Is there a reason why this specific restaurant cannot provide a customer with a paid receipt?

We had breakfast here before heading to the desert to go off-roading.\n\nSo let's start with the location.. It's located on Rainbow and Charleston. It's way off the Strip. But it sure is a local favorite. Finding a parking spot close enough is not always easy but it can only mean one thing.. Jamms is packed! They do get really busy and you might have to wait a few minutes to be seated but I'm telling you it is worth your while.\n\nAbout the service. Nothing but the most jolly and caring people. It's like coming to breakfast at grandma's or your aunt. The servers always have a big smile on their faces and you are always greeted warmly. Nothing can beat that to start your day!\n\nThen there's the food.. Big generous servings. Since I checked-in on Yelp on our 3rd. visit (this morning) we got a FREE pot of bread.. You can choose either plain, cinnamon & raisin, or the special. I chose the special which for today was Peanut Butter & Spice. It was served with what I believe is a cream cheese butter spread. Oh, it's to die for!!!\n\nWe also got half a serving of their biscuits & gravy and OMG! It was delicious. I ordered Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs cooked over-medium (that's how I always have my eggs).  It came with hash browns and another pot of bread. This time I asked for it to be plain. And of course it did not disappoint. I finished my whole plate!!! I was so full.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered a Panini Bread with a side of Steak Fries and he said on his first bite, \"Oh my God! This is a great Panini!\" And he doesn't always pay much compliments about sandwiches.. Only the well deserving ones.\n\nAll in all, our dining experience at Jamms is great as always! We shall come back again sometime soon.. I strongly recommend them for people looking for a good straight-forward and unpretentious breakfast/brunch for cheap with awesome service."

We received a free pot of bread for checking in on Yelp!\n\nFood: 4/5\nOur main dishes were on our table less than 10 mins after we ordered it.  Somewhere before it came, we received our pots of bread.  I've had better, but it wasn't too bad.  It was just tad heavier and drier than what I personally prefer.  The food was decent.  I'd say its a tier above a typical Denny's or IHOP for sure.\n\nLocation: 4/5\nThe atmosphere of the place has an early 80's late 70's breakfast diner sort of feel to it.  Very warm with some character.  It pairs nicely with their breakfast selection, and I could see this place being a regular breakfast joint for people to go to and start their mornings in.\n\nOverall: 4/5"

But, after a few minutes- the waiting area was filled to the brim with hungry patrons.  \n\nI ordered the Eggs Florentine and after a number of misses with the hollandaise sauce at other breakfast joints- I finally found one that was perfect.  Of course, I mentioned yelp- and even got a free pot of freshly baked bread- and I selected the flavor of the day: apricot.  Yummo! My husband ordered his usual- chicken fried steak with a side of country potatoes and devoured it.  My cousin ordered an omelet and another ordered a sandwich with steak fries which were so delicious.  We also shared a plate of peach french toast and not a crumb was left.  Yes- we were quite the hungry bunch. \n\nAwesome service, awesome food and I love the fact that it is family owned.  We even left with some \"Jamms coffee mugs\" because we are such fans.

They serve them in a little fryer basket. They also have the original bread bowl. It's bread made in a little muffin cup, the bowl. They have white, wheat, and cinnamon raisin. I loved the cinnamon raisin. They didn't keep my coffee cup full, but did give me a second cup before I left. Over all, the food was great,very original presentation, very pleasant ambiance, service was good with hardly any wait. It's a place you want to return to. Oh, they serve breakfast any time of day.

The orange juice is delicious (I'm not sure if they claim its fresh-squeezed, but I have my doubts).

I thought it tasted a lot like a white castle. \nThe pancake combo comes with your choice of sausage or bacon and then eggs cooked however you like them.  The pancakes were ridiculously fluffy-they had to have been an inch thick!  They were so tasty and the eggs and sausage were perfect.  They brought out two containers of butter without me asking, which I really appreciated.  There's nothing worse than getting big pancakes and they hand you one packet of butter.  \nThe grits were cooked well but lacked salt.  I liked that they brought butter with the grits without asking.

They always have cinnamon raisin and they have a daily special when I went it was chocolate caramel now I have to tell you that was a little over-the-top for me you could only taste the chocolate not even the caramel but the cinnamon raisin... amazing and the pot of bread is just what it sounds like.  don't be fooled by the butter on the side no no no no it's not just  butter it's actually cream cheese icing. That's right cream cheese icing on the side of your pot of bread. I don't think I need to say anything else. I do remember ordering other things but I don't remember them not like I remember the pot of bread"

Many of the diners here in Vegas either give you a small omelette/skimp on the ingredients or give you an enormous omelette which no normal person can stomach. Jamms gives you a good portion size with quality ingredients for a great price. They also offer tapas plates which is an awesome idea for a brunch to try many breakfast dishes as this meal is by far the hardest to decide in the morning. I very much enjoyed my meal here from the waitstaff to the meal to the 10% yelp check in coupon to the fact that my meal came in at $20 for a solid morning starter. One of the best of its kind in local Las Vegas."

The Fat Man knows what he's talking about when it comes to food.\n\nYou want the skinny on this place from the Fat Man?  I live off of Boulder Hwy in Henderson.  This place is at Rainbow and Charleston.  (About 35 minutes from my house.)  I don't do mornings, and I'm not generally a breakfast eater...But at least once a month, my wife and I get up early and trek across town just to eat at Jamms.  \n\nOver the years I've had a few things on their lunch menu, and I'll be honest...I'm not a fan.  But their breakfast....oh baby, their breakfast.  Their omelets are light and fluffy and PACKED with toppings.  They have about 30 omelets to choose from, so you have plenty of options (The White Castle is by far my favorite.)  Their corn flake french toast is AMAZING.  I have often wished for their signature pina colada french toast as a dessert after dinner at night.  (When I start thinking about that is usually when we go to Jamms the next morning)       \n\nTheir fresh baked pot-o-bread is some of the best bread I've ever had.  It's like a poofy dinner roll baked like a muffin, only airier and fluffier and full of wonderousness. (And yes, that's a word.  I just made it up.) I usually get the original, but they also offer cinnamon raisin and the \"flavor of the day\".\n\nLadies and Gents, as I said before, I don't do mornings.  As I often say, \"they call it mourning for a reason\".  Anything that can make me EXCITED about getting up early is something special.  Jamms is one of those rare things. \n\nThe only thing better than the food at Jamms is the atmosphere.  The staff is friendly, helpful, and courteous.  They are always smiling and chatting with the customers.  They are excellent about refilling drinks and making sure you are enjoying your meal, but they also find that perfect line between being helpful and not hovering.  Ronnie (the owner) has great taste in employees, and has almost no turnover.  Almost all of the wait staff has been there since I started going there nearly 10 years ago.  \n\nMy only caution about this place is to be careful.  Once you have eaten here a few times, it can become an addiction.  I'm pretty sure they put crack in their food to make you crave it more.  :)"

I go back about ten mins later and our table is ready, but they won't seat me as my whole party is not there. Whole party??? It's just me and my boyfriend. I tell them he's right next door and will be back in a minute but they still refuse to seat me. I guess that is just their policy, but it put a bad taste in my mouth and everything got worse from there. \n\nOur server while nice, messed up our order. I wanted to try the weekly pot O bread, which was strawberry almond, but she brought me out cinnamon raisin. Womp womp. I ended up just eating it, because I don't like to complain. It was pretty good though. Boyfriend ordered a Philly with no mushrooms, and it came out with shrooms. She admitted that was her mistake and offered to correct his sandwich, but he decided to order something else instead. He chose a chili burger. This was the smallest burger ever and you could tell the chili came from a can. I ordered the eggs benedict with home fries. I got about 2oz of home fries, which are potatoes with bell pepper and onions. They were good, but I had two bites and they were gone. The hollandaise on my eggs did not have much flavor, so the whole dish suffered. \n\nI paid just about $30 including tax and tip which is wayyyyy too much for just an ok meal. I probably won't be back."

First let me mention there are a ton of options so it may take you awhile to choose. Also the portions are large-size so come with an appetite or be prepared to take leftovers. I was please to find they added tapas portions, smaller plate styles at half the cost.\n     This particular time I got the Rueben omelette (corned beef,sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese.) The tender corned beef really went well with the tangy sweetness of the sauerkraut. Also I got the pot of bread (cinnamon and raisin with side of cream cheese icing) yummy! They did come out with a pistachio pot of bread I'm dieing to try. When you check in on yelp they give you a free pot of bread but they said they were out of pistachio which is odd because they offered it to the table next to us so I don't know. Nonetheless my meal was great.\n    Now my boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs. I warned him about ordering steak at a place that doesn't really specialize in that bc you can't expect much from a small breakfast joint but he took the risk lol. Of course I was right the steak looked like a chewed up oversized piece of bacon. He said it was tough, chewey, and tasted kind of like an old belt. However the scrambled eggs were plain and to be expected. The pancakes were really good and fluffy.\n    Overall everything was great on my behalf and you cant beat the cost we spent under $30. Word of advice stick with breakfast it's what they are known for and don't order the steak.....obviously."

This time, we walked right in and found a seat without a problem.  \n\nTo share, we ordered French toast sticks and our Yelp check-in came with a free order of 'pot' bread. Who knew Vegas could consistently dish out amazing pieces of breaded sweetness!? The French toast sticks were a crisp golden brown, doused with cinnamon & powdered sugar, buttered and came with a side of good ol' fashioned syrup. The pot bread was truly a surprising delight. Scratch that, the NUTELLA PEANUT BUTTER it came with was truly the surprising delight. Sooo rich, so sugary.. *Sweats profusely* I actually don't like sugar rushes. I triggered one here and don't plan on having another one anytime soon.\n\nI grabbed the chicken fried steak in country gravy with eggs over easy and home fries. I feel like I say this every time I eat this meal at a new location, but easily one of the best chicken fried steaks I've had in awhile. HUGE portion size that could easily feed two; Breaded with seasons that tickle the senses, a milky / creamy chicken gravy, moist insides and packed with a crunch. The gravy wasn't slopped all over the plate either. Right down the center of the steak with the ends just sticking out - you know it's the real deal when you subtract the gravy and have the steak bare.. if it's good without the gravy, then you have yourself a winner. In this case it was a complete winner.. The home fries were up to par too - with caramelized onions, bell peppers, crisp edges and just enough salt.  But really, I can't believe I wasted stomach space on the sweet stuff. I was relatively upset when I realized I was already full just about halfway through.. So, I unbuckled my pants and let the button go. We were finishing this off no matter what. Every bite was savored, and not forgotten. \n\nOur service was great, from hostess, to waitress, to the busser who rolled through and took plates not being used as well as various staff members giving the complimentary coffee / water refill here and there. Nothing weird happened, everyone was smiling, the prices were low and my stomach was appreciative."

Nondescript from the exterior but cozy and kitsch inside as a friendly staff bounced between tables with endless refills of coffee from Illy at a mere $2.75 it was to a diverse menu and a hot, yeasty 'pot of bread' slathered with Nutella and toasted almonds that I arrived and after perusing the menu at length an order was placed, a server named Shirley warning me that it would be \"a lot of food,\" but failing to inform me of noted upcharges of $2 for a single Red Velvet Pancake and $1.25 for grits in place of potatoes.  Jovial in spirit with tunes ranging from Sinatra to Madonna playing overhead it was perhaps a ten minute wait after the bread that the rest of my meal arrived and with each item larger than expected in size it was indeed a substantial breakfast with only the cocoa-less Red Velvet failing to impress...the flavor merely that of a decent buttermilk pancake gussied up with $2 in dye.  Speaking to the rest, suffice it to say that it would be hard to mess up something as decadent as the signature \"S'Mores\" with ample chocolate chips and chocolate syrup finding balance in bold buttermilk, marshmallows, plus a dollop of whipped cream and yet as good as the pancake was, the un-fried riff on the Monte Cristo easily stole the show as golden Texas Toast dipped in custard housed Ham, Turkey, and Swiss of good quality and quantity, all just waiting for a sweet gilding of maple syrup to make flavors pop.  Never one to quibble prices but a firm believer that upcharges should always be disclosed Jamms strikes me as a good-enough place in a city with plenty of similar options; a bit better than some and a bit worse than others...the sort of place I'm sure to revisit at some point for the Waffle Sundae or the Stuffed French Toast, but not before investigating other family owned spots or before second visits to Blueberry Hill, Hash House, Egg & I, or Baby Stacks."

Their signature item, the Pot Bread, was just ok. We head the cinnamon raisin and it was good but nothing really special.  My husband had the meat lovers omelet and OMG meat.  I had the reuben benedict, the English muffin was nice and crispy, eggs well cooked, hollandaise was missing a bit of bite and the whole thing was a little under salted but most things are for me. The coffee cups are huge for a diner and they have great coffee.  Great service and pricing is on par with larger breakfast chains like IHOP. Overall great experience, will definitely be back."

I wish I could say that I believe Jamms Restaurant is jammin' or had some delicious  and wondrous homemade jam, however I cannot but that is alright just like how the restaurant is alright.\n\nMostly certainly it was a miscommunication between myself and the name of the restaurant as I thought that perhaps the restaurant would serve some awesome jam, but to my dismay only the pre-packaged Knott's jam is available.. darn.\n\nThe menu consist of your typical breakfast items, omelets, sandwiches, corn beef hash, pancakes, but you don't need something extraordinary as long as the ordinary is consistently delicious. Although during my visits I was not particularly impressed by my dishes. Reason being is that I felt that my Jamm's signature omelet which was composed of steak, bearnaise sauce, murshrooms and cheese was somewhat bland and my steak was difficult to chew. I also had a piece of my friend's Jamm's french toast which was battered and covered in corn flakes, my impressions are that I will probably stick with the normal french toast as the specialty is a little mushy for me. \n\nThe service was jammin' though, the waitress were friendly, helpful, and refilled my water often. My dining companions went MIA after ordering but the waitress was very understanding and patient with that, always monitoring when my friends would come back to the table. However I would like to mention that the waitress had no clue what I was talking about when I mentioned the Yelp special nor did the cashier, which made things a little embarrassing for myself as I had to explain their special promo to receive my free pot of bread.. the jammin' stopped there unfortunately.\n\nMaybe in the future when I am tired of my usual breakfast places again I will give Jamms another try or perhaps for lunch I could jam with the California Club"

The decor was very dated and to be honest the place felt dirty to me.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered omelets, the Jamm's specialty omelet and the Ruben omelet both notated as favorite items on the menu. Maybe we just ordered the wrong meals as both left a lot to be desired. The home potatoes were inedible. It's a shame I was given such a large portion. The meals do however come with a \"pot o' bread'. You can choose cinnamon raisin or white bread. These reminded me of bread my grandmother used to make at Thanksgiving, just plain ol yeasty bread. This trip down memory lane gave Jamm's the extra star. \n\nTo be a good breakfast spot, the coffee needs to be spot on. This was another failing aspect of Jamm's. They use Illy coffee which I find to lack the robustness I love about coffee, almost watered down. I know many people love Illy though so this might just be a matter of preference.\n\nOverall, I will probably never return to Jamm's. I typically give places two chances to win me over but on a good day Jamm's could probably only muster one additional star out of me."

They're always very friendly, even when busy, and they take care of you as if you were family.\n\nI've been here a handful of times as it's close to campus and I focus better in class when I'm happily stuffed. I've gotten breakfast all but one time in which I ordered the French Onion Soup and a salad and it was a total miss!\n\nThe French Onion Soup has a light broth with way too much thyme in it. The bread was a cheap generic white bread, so it got sort of slimy once it soaked up the broth. The onions were a thick slice and were not meltingly soft.\nThe salad which was Jamms House Salad was a cabbage salad with an \"Asian\" dressing. By cabbage salad, I mean, chopped green cabbage. That's it. The dressing itself was alright with some sesame oil and rice wine vinegar, but it was too heavy on the sugar.\n\nThat being said, the only thing I've eaten here for breakfast is omelets! The reason? Simple: The cheese. Oh my goodness, the cheese!! The omelets here are delicious but they definitely cheat by adding A LOT of cheese, which I'm a total sucker for. I usually eat healthy breakfasts, but the cheesy omelets here do me in every time. So much cheese you have to chew it well. It's glorious!\nThe Margie is my favorite omelet they have. It comes stuffed with mushrooms, tomatoes and artichoke hearts. Sometimes I add green peppers, sometimes I add spinach, but I always get egg whites which is a slight up charge ($1). They saute the vegetables before putting them in the omelets, so the tomato gets a little cooked which I love. It comes with your choice of potato (fries, hashbrowns, home fries) and bread.\n\nTheir bread selection is unique in that they offer a \"pot of bread.\" If you like dinner rolls, you'll love this. Their pots of bread are really soft, pillowy, yeasty white breads. They offer seasonal flavors (I once had a divine raspberry and lemon), white, and cinnamon. Or you can get toast of course. I usually get fruit instead of potatoes and no toast or bread (at an up charge $3). The fruit here is always a medley of melon.\n\nGreat service, and amaaaazing gooey cheesy omelets! Coffee is decent.. just decent."

The hash browns were not over cooked or undercooked.  They were golden brown with a nice crisp exterior and nice soft interior.  The biscuit was very soft.  Melts in your mouth.  Coffee was good too."

Think that it could be more elaborate in looks and taste, like maybe being more browned and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Somewhat like a croissant. My friend and I shared the pumpkin cinnamon pot of bread. There is a weekly special. The service was nice, but as soon as I asked for the free pot of bread for my yelp check in, I was told it was for Dine In only. I didn't know, it's not documented anywhere. Anyway, I got a hard time for it. Just sayin.. the lady put it in a to go bag and said I we gonna do it anyway. Thanks. It want that big of a deal!

I have never had slow service or a bad server, in fact, they get me in and out very quickly so I never worry. \n\nThey have a great selection of omelettes and pancakes (Smores are the best) and they have a special Pot of Bread every now and then.

So much for that welcome.\n\nOur server was the best part of our experience. I believe her name was Sandy. She, unlike the hostess, was very welcoming, friendly and answered all of our questions as first time guests. Our food (including gratis Pots of Bread) was brought out promptly, so we appreciated that.\n\nMy Waffle Benedict meal was a 3/5.  Pepper flavor of the home fries was a little overpowering. Waffle was light and fluffy, Hollandaise was creamy and flavorful. But the Canadian bacon was way too thick for a Benedict. It was like chewing on a piece of leather. In my humble opinion, Kailyn's Kitchen still wins for best Benny in town.\nIn addition, I have to add that I was not offered a refill of coffee until our check came. Big deal. They would've scored those points back had they provided a restaurant-style thermos with more coffee at the table, if they're too busy to check up on us...come on, even IHOP does that. Yes, I went there.\n\nWe were passed with the check and thanked by Sandy. No message to pay at the register, so we sat awkwardly with our payment for several minutes before having to figure it out ourselves. We get to see the lovely hostess again, who says nothing as we give her our card and check. \"Would you like your receipt?\" Is this McDonald's? Yes we would. Handed our check without so much as have a nice day.\n\nPerhaps it was an off day for these people. Unfortunately not a great impression was left for us as first timers. Consistency is the key to the success of a small business, and if you can't master that art, you will miss out on a lot of opportunity."

After waiting for @ 20 min just to have our order taken it was proof then why the wait to sit takes a long time. I think we had more interaction w the bus boy than out waitress. Had to ask for refills which should never happen. Stay on top of your customers please!!! Finally food has been eaten and plates removed and again another long long wait for the check. Over all the service alone will keep us from coming back. No one wants to waste half a day at this. Your staff can be friendly as our waitress was, but when you fail to attend to your customers you fail to get returning ones."

They have really good pancakes, and decent burgers. The staff is friendly, but they really do get crowded on the weekends. Especially on Sunday morning. The staff is friendly, and the prices are okay.  I do love the smores pancakes, and the cornflaked French toast.  You should give it a try you will love the home kitchen feeling and friendly staff"

If you don't have access to a car consider renting one to drive to this gem. The \"pot of bread\"  (preferably flavored) with the honey butter is mandatory eating. My wife and I both had the make your own omelette ($9.99) which comes with a \"pot of bread\" and choice of potatoes. (Consider a little basket of sweet potato fries if you want something different than hash browns.) I planned on attaching pics of the food, but after one taste it was gone before I remembered that I wanted to take pics. Don't tell anyone about this place otherwise it will likely he too crowded as more people venture to this prized breakfast location."

I remember how good it was and how much I liked it. So I recommend that we go here for breakfast. \nI asked the waitress if I could order of the child's menu because I have gone through oral cancer and do not eat that much. She goes yes you can, we also have all our omelets at a senior size. (Which is half the size) I told her that would be great. So I order the omelette with sun dried tomatoes, green onions and cream cheese. It came out half the size of a full order, the sun dried tomatoes was super dried out. I have had them there before and they have been soft and easy to eat. \n\nThen here comes the ticket shock, you would think that you get a senior size the price would be less for half the size. WRONG IT STILL CHARGE FULL PRICE. I brought this up and was told it a smaller size but you still charge full price. We brought this up with the cashier, she was like oh well. \n\nIf this how they treat people that is not right. They have lost me has a customer and I will not be back. I will tell all my Vegas friends not to eat here."

The pancakes were doughy and not cooked through, the eggs were a spongy egg-replacement, and the rest was average. \n\nMy hubby had the Corned Beef Hash Eggs Benedict at the waiter's recommendation and it was really slimy and the English muffin basically drowned and dissolved in all of the sauce. His hashbrowns were greasy and left a lot to be desired. \n\nWe ordered the S'mores pancake to try it and it was just a pancake with chocolate chips and marshmallows sprinkled on top, it was gross. Our waiter didn't take it off our tab or bring us the cinnamon raisin pot of bread we ordered. \n\nNot worth coming back, and no clue why it is so highly rated.

She told us she couldn't seat us unless our whole party was there. I understand places that have this policy, but usually they tend to explain it nicer than they did here. The woman's tone was very unfriendly. We asked if it was possible just to put us at a table for 5 just incase the little brother snuck in a little late, not even order and her response was \"well it depends if I seat you at a table for 4 or 5\" ... Ok so please make it 5? Thankfully right then the little brother walked in and we didn't have to deal with her anymore. We were seated and quickly taken care of by a really spunky and nice waitress, she was seriously great. Big personality! \nI ordered the small plate omelet and their pot bread (cinnamon raisin). The omelet was average, I really wasn't blown away by it. The saving grace of the meal was the pot bread which was warm and delicious! \nFood was ok, front desk customer service was bad, and waitress was great! Probably won't go out of my way to eat here again when I visit Vegas."

We made the 8 mile trek from the strip and found Jams.\n\nThe first visit I had the Steak and Eggs. The steak was nothing fancy, just a typical cheap diner steak. It was cooked well but it was just okay. The \"breadpot\" was pretty damn tasty. I had cinnamon raisin and added lots of whipped butter. VERY tasty =D\n\nThe second visit (not my idea.... families idea...) I had the Texas Chili Omelet. This visit proved to be much tastier! The chili was meaty and flavorful. They were more than willing to add onions and jalapenos, per my request. I had the pumpkin and marshmallow breadpot with sweeeeet sugary frosting =D. \n\nOverall it's a great local place. The staff was quick and friendly. Refills were pretty quick. \n\nOnly thing that bothers be is the gramatically incorrect wording on the front page of the menu."

We had one of their pot breads to start (cinnamon raisin), which was awesome and free with yelp checkin! The sweetened butter was fabulous too.  For our mains, I had the breakfast burrito which was a perfectly prepared burrito filled with eggs, onions, and cheese and some delicious hash browns.  It was excellent.  But as good as that was, my wife's Jamms breakfast sandwich was better.  It was easily the best breakfast sandwich I've had.  Ham, cheese, eggs, thick Texas toast.  It was fabulous.  The home fries were delicious as well.\n\nWith that said, I also have to comment on the outstanding service provides by the employees at this establishment.  From the moment we came in and the hostess took our name to the end of our meal, service was friendly and outstanding.  We were greated promptly, sat at a perfectly clean table as soon as it was ready (there was a line when we arrived, as the place is deservedly popular), and our drinks (coffee and water) never reached empty.  Orders were taken quickly, food was brought promptly, it was a tour de force of outstanding service. And, to top it all off, this place is a great value.  Prices were extremely reasonable!\n\nOverall I cannot recomment this place enough.  Go here and enjoy.  You will love it!"

I've a huge breakfast fan, and am always looking to try new places. \n\nIt was pretty packed when I got there, and so I had high hopes. Busy places usually mean good food. \n\nService itself was just bad. We were seated and given our menus, but no one came around after that for at least seven minutes. And when our waitress finally did come around, she had a very snide attitude.\n\nI ordered the chicken fried steak. The steak was good and flavorful, and not the least bit dry. The gravy however, which was put on heavy handed, was disappointing. It had no flavor and added nothing to the dish. The scrambled eggs I ordered with it, were very dry. Which is a big pet peeve of mine. Scrambled eggs are probably my favorite thing to eat, and ruined eggs just ruin my meal. \n\nThe Sandy omelet was ordered by a couple others that I was eating with. Both of which said their omelets were dried out as well. And that it was just disgustingly full of bacon. \n\nThe Cinnamon raisin pot of bread was probably the best thing that was served to us. \n\nI definitely don't see myself going back to this establishment."

I then looked it up on here and read about the special offer for a free pot of bread.  I love bread and was excited to find out what it was exactly and to try it.  After our waitress took our orders I mentioned Yelp and asked about the pot of bread.  She didn't seem familiar with the offer, but didn't question it at all and brought me one.  In case you're wondering, it's a personal sized piece of bread that comes in a little round bowl and resembles a large cupcake.  I got the cinnamon-raisin one and it was definitely the best part of my dining experience.  The top was just a little toasted and the middle was soft and chewy.  If that were all I ate I'd have given them 5 stars, but sadly it went downhill from there.    \nI ordered an omelet with avocado, bacon, and cheddar and it was a big disappointment.  There was quite a bit of bacon inside, but it was all way overcooked and a little thick, so it was rock hard.  The avocado was good but it was all on one side, so I had to open it up and spread it out.  Also, the only cheddar I found was a few shredded pieces on top.  Like I said, very disappointing.  In hindsight I should have sent it back and either gotten something else or had them remake it.\nThey give a choice of hash browns or home fries and I had the latter.  They were good and had bits of onion and bell pepper mixed in.  Overall, I can see how this place could be good, but my experience wasn't the best.  I'd give 'em a mulligan tho."

The choices of sides are many - seasoned fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, potato salad, coleslaw, cabbage salad and a regular side salad.  The drink selection left something to be desired, but they do carry the essentials. (Coke products for sodas)  While the items are definitely not standard, it *is* a smaller overall menu than most places.\n\nA recent addition (I don't remember seeing it on their lunch menu) is \"The Jamminator\" - a whopping 24 oz burger with your choice of toppings.  If you take the challenge and can eat it all in one sitting, they give you a free t-shirt.  After seeing how big their regular burgers are... that thing has to be monstrous.\n\nI had the Egg Salad Burger.  (Yup - a 10 oz burger with a scoop of egg salad on top, plus the normal fixins.)  It was fantastic, but super big.  Definitely something to cut in half and take part home for later.  For my side I chose the sweet potato fries; they came spinkled with powdered sugar.  I think I could've just eaten a plate of those by itself and been satisfied.  Super delicious, and a nice sweet change-up from normal fries.\n\nThe waitstaff is super friendly, almost to a fault.  Great group of people, though.\n\nComparing what you get for the money you spend, this is easily one of my favorite diner-style restaurants in town.

I haven't had a bad meal there in at least a dozen visits for breakfast.\n\nIf only I'm lucky enough to visit when that cackling waitress has the day off. She's a great gal, don't get me wrong, but wow that laugh is tough to take early in the morning.\n\nOne time I had a \"fluffy\" omelet.  Well, it wasn't fluffy.  It was a regular omelet like any other.  I mentioned it to the lady at the cash register when I paid.  \"I don't think that was a fluffy omelet,\" I said.  Just a harmless comment, not a complaint.\n\nOf course she got huffy.  I think she was the owner.  She looked at me like, Who are you the galloping gourmet?  \"All of our omelets are fluffy,\" she insisted in a crabby tone.  \n\nOK fine, calm down.  It left me with such a negative feeling I haven't been back. It's not that I'm holding a grudge but an experience like that cuts my enthusiasm for a place.  I don't feel welcome there anymore. Now I go to Red Rock casino or Denny's. Jamm's is so busy that one customer more or less is no big deal. They won't have that annoying fluffy omelet guy to deal with anymore.  \n\nGood for kids:  Don't encourage people with \"good for kids\" votes.  Let 'em invade Denny's or I-Hop with their screaming whining little hellions. This is a small restaurant.  A tantrum will disrupt the whole place."

Pot bread comes with pot bread already and your choice of potato fries or hash-browns.  I choice the hash-browns.  \n\nThe rest of my part choose the chicken fried steak with three eggs, your choice how preparation, and a Provencal Cheese omelet with fresh diced tomatoes, spinach and provolone cheese.  \n\nThis is definitely a place worth trying and repeating all over again!

I took a surprisingly lengthy (twss) and expensive round trip cab ride way out on Rainbow rd where you could still kinda see the strip but it was still $30 away. Anyway, after passing the strip mall where this place sits a few times, cabbie found it and I settled up to the counter in a surprisingly empty restaurant (well it was about 3pm on a weekday). A very friendly waitress greeted me and the french toast I ordered was well worth the journey. If you haven't had corn flake french toast before, this is a good place to try it. Perfectly cooked on some good bread and quite tasty. The corn flakey crunch adds so much to the french toast experience, you may never make french toast the same again. Awesome."

There was a large empty booth that we requested, but they said they would not allow us to use it since they didn't think we would fit. They didn't even let us try, and the majority of our party was small children, so we would have fit. They then told us the only way to let us eat was to put us at two tables at opposite sides of the restaurant. It was very frustrating. By that time we had been there about 40 minutes and everyone was getting very hangry. We ended up having to just go somewhere else. We wish they would have just told us they didn't have room for that many people when we originally called so we didn't waste our time.

Menu has about ten different omelets, in addition to skillets, benedicts, and the usual waffles, pancakes, etc. along with lunch options: sandwiches, burgers, soups, and salads.\n\nBF and I started with coffee and OJ, then opted for different omelets: the Jamm's signature omelet for me  (b\u00e9arnaise sauce on the side, I never used it), Joe's omelet for my guy. Each omelet is about $10, and includes your bread of choice (I opted for the plain pot bread, BF had the special: walnut brownie) as well as an additional side (wedge fries for me, cottage cheese for the dude).\nGood portion sizes for the price, both with the variety of sides and the sizes of individual items.\n\nOmelets were both cooked perfectly: others have said they are drowning in cheese, which is not entirely true. Mine had a good amount, but the Joe's omelet was a little lighter. Both had good amounts of meat and veggies. \nThe fries are tasty and seasoned, served in a cute little individual fryer basket container (cute!), cottage cheese is standard. The pot bread was a delightful surprise! Preferred the plain flavor: reminded me of slightly-sweet biscuits with dinner, growing up with homestyle country meals. The walnut brownie pot bread was sweet, but no overwhelmingly chocolatey or nutty- the name had made me expect more of a dessert on the table, but it wasn't overkill.\n\nService, as others have said, rocks.

Sounds easy but it can be a challenge because of the huge portions. I highly recommend this place. A must eat in Las Vegas."

We didn't wait too long so that was cool was a good thing.\n\nOnce we had sat down, someone had come over to take our drinks right away. And if you're a big coffee person, this place is for you. They make sure that your coffee is never low or out during your whole dining experience.\n\nMy Husband ordered the Corn Beef Hash with a side of toast, which tasted really good. It wasn't too salty like most placed that we have tried. And the hash browns were a good sized portion and very crispy.\n\nI had ordered the Country Fried Steak with the famous Pot Bread on the side, and the Steak was good, but the gravy tasted like packaged gravy to me. It was also a little bland and it's sad to say I had add a little salt and pepper on top to add some flavor. But everything else was delicious. My Hash Brown were just as crispy and delicious as the one my husband had. Oh and the pot bread... I've never tried anything like that before and it was super tasty, I got the cinnamon raisin pot bread and OH MY GOODNESS, DELICIOUS. it came out warm and it wasn't too sweet even when I added the icing on top. Yum.\n\nOverall I had a good dining experience here at Jamms except when My husband and I received our food it wasn't as hot as I expected to be. I felt that they were so slammed that they might have forgotten about our food because the table besides us got sat 15-20 minutes after we did and got their food the same time. But we will be back though, because everyone was so sweet and we love Mom and Pop Shops"

The only thing is that I wish my breakfast had a little less salt, but I have to give them props for using FRESH CORNED BEEF for their corned beef hash! Their Cinnamon Raisin pot of bread was excellent and it was enough for us to take back to our room and heat up for the next day! :) YUM!!!"

The restaurant is located in a strip mall location and looks like a good find when you search for it.  There was a long line for a wait and the locals told me I would not be disappointed when I questioned the 20 min wait before a flight so I stayed with my friends who are locals.  The wait wasn't too long ..our server took a bit of time getting to us because they were busy ...my fresh cup of coffee (there's a portion on the menu that says that we all deserve it to be fresh) was never refilled ...after I asked for it it came as I was almost done with my meal.  My gauge of a good breakfast is always a Benedict ...I've had multiple variations of it and it's my go to ...must be the sauce ....the menu talked about how you should get turkey if you want it but I guess it only applies to sausage and not bacon ..no beef or pork for me.  I opted for the Benedict with spinach ..egg was ok ..I asked for over medium and it came out over easy ..don't like it when the egg white is still liquid ...the hollandaise was average - nothing extra added to it and the spinach fairly bland.  I did order the bread in a tin and that was decent - I got to sample the plain, raisin and finally red velvet - the cook on each was different and I did finish the bread the only part of my meal that I polished along with the coffee.  I'm pretty limited in some of the things I can eat so when there's an item on the menu that excites me and its executed well I am pleased.  Social media is definitely something this restaurant does well and I think it contributes to their awards and recognition because the food is ok just like any other standard breakfast place out there."

Total hole in the wall diner feel with booths. \n\nOrdered the corned beef hash that comes with 2 eggs, hash browns and their famous pot of bread. I got the lemon and blueberry, which was their flavor of the week and it came out piping hot with sweet butter cream. They also have plain and cinnamon raisin daily. Everything was great! Did not disappoint and it was a good size portion. My pot of bread wasn't quite ready with the rest of the order, so she gave me a complimentary cinnamon raisin also. \n\nNext time I'm going to order the home fries instead. It's not the typical diced potatoes, but they were sliced and looked almost like hash. Tasted hubby's and it was good. He ordered the Reuben omelet, my son had a made to order omelet and my other son had the steak and eggs. Everyone enjoyed their meals and said the restaurant was a good choice. Will definitely be back!"

The LAST place on earth I thought I'd find it is Vegas. \n\nBringing my visiting PA native parents here at an off peak time (very important to avoid a long wait at this popular spot) we were seated immediately by friendly staff. Our waitress came over promptly and took our drink order. Consummate coffee drinkers, my family complimented Jamms regular brew. I've had their French press prior, and that was just as delicious. \n\nMom and Pop took forever to decide but two words on the menu immediately decided for me: taylor ham. This Jersey breakfast staple is impossible to find outside of the Mid-Atlantic!! The Taylor Ham breakfast sandwich with (gasp!) REAL griddled potatoes was my choice. One bite and I was transported back to college and better days. Listen, I'm not an asshole that waxes poetic about food for no reason, but I'm not kidding--the sandwich was bomb. \n\nMom got the 2 egg breakfast with bacon and hashbrowns because she's boring and a picky eater. It was as good as it gets with eggs over medium cooked perfectly. Dad got Joes omelet which was big enough to make him think twice about finishing the whole thing (he did though, because he is a machine). \n\nThe pot o bread--a fluffy roll baked in a muffin tin--was phenomenal. Do yourself a favor and get the flavored ones. Cinnamon raisin is a delicious choice!!\n\nOur food was served almost immediately after ordering, and server Jasmine was perfectly attentive without being overbearing--a hard balance to master. This place is popular for a reason so be prepared to wait but trust me, it's worth it."

I was dissapointed that they came out as little chopped up bits of seasoned potatoes with peppers and onions...did I order the wrong thing? I'm confused on what the potatoes are in the yelp review pics that look like they are super crispy on top, almost looked like a mound if mashed- are they the breakfast potatotes? The guy next to me had a dif style but they still looked shredded. Either way the pancakes were amazing, little crispy on the side and barely needed any syrup they were so tasty. They are def the buttery version as opposed to a dryer type like at maple tree, cracked egg and weiss deli. I will def be back to try and get those potatoes. Very friendly atmosphere....would have been 5 stars had I gotten the right homefries!"

The pot o' bread is Jamms signature, basically a big yeasty dinner roll that comes with most of the breakfast platters, as well as getting a free one with your Yelp check-in.  Customers can choose the standard plain, cinnamon raisin, or the pot o'bread of the week; today's choice was triple chocolate brownie.  I had that pot o' bread plus the cinnamon raisin one that came with my corned beef hash breakfast--carb loading indeed!

My benedict was nothing special.  The corned beef being the only thing making it somewhat like a Reuben.  I love eggs benedict.  I guess I just expected more.  Another element or two of the Reuben would have improved it.  The kids were happy with their meals.  Service was ok.  They were busy so I don't really fault them for that.

Jamms Restaurant was on the top of the recommended lists on various websites. I definitely do not regret my decision to come here... The service was very good, even though the waitress accidentally forgot my honey mustard, but she apologized for it and still did a good job otherwise. I ordered an omelet with home potatoes, along with the plain flavor for the pot of the bread. It was a good experience. I will stop by the next time I come to Las Vegas. It'd definitely be a good hangover breakfast for those who choose to party and gamble at the night."

I ordered a omelet here and was really surprised by the size of the omelet, the amount of vegetables, and best of all the perfect amount of cheese. The omelet was fluffy and didn't have a overcooked patch of burnt on it at all. It was very beautiful. I was there at 8:30 am on Monday and I was so happy that there weren't loud mulitple crowds. It was consistently busy but not overwhelming and annoying. My friend and I sat there for quite a while catching up and best of all the server didn't harrass constantly. They let us talk for quite awhile without interrupting. \nThe only bad thing I had to say was the hashbrowns were TOO crispy for me. They were overcooked and crunchy and had that burnt potato flavor. Other than that---this is one of my new favorite spots for breakfast."

For the food, my omelet was filled generously, but the overall flavor and stiffness factor weren't my ideal. I think I need to try something other than an omelet next time. Note: They serve Illy coffee, and you can even have it in a French press.\n\nBut, what I really wanted to let you know is that on Fridays they have fish and chips, and my husband went googley-eyed and inhaled the giant pieces of fish filet with boyish delight.

It was kind of a check in the box for me, so if nothing else I'm glad to knock another one off the list. \n\nCame here on a Sunday and the line was out the door, which is usually a good indication the food is worth the wait. And surprisingly, the line moved rather quickly. And thank goodness because we were all in desperate need of nourishment after the night out we had. (Note to self: lots of sake, sushi & shots are a recipe for disaster, ugh!) Lol! \n\nAnyways...first impression: it's a very small busy diner that could use some major updating. Lots of noise and hustle & bustle. Sitting near the kitchen I got a good glimpse of the waitresses & cooks frantically trying to get food out. Even so, our food took a bit longer than expected to make it's way to our table but in all fairness it was a Sunday not to mention, Mother's Day. We should feel lucky we were able to get seated so quickly. \n\nOn to the food. The pot-o-bread was good, free with your Yelp check-in. I guess that's what they're known for. Nothing here that really stood out to me. The guys seemed to be pleased with their meals. My omelet was just okay. The cheese on top wasn't melted. And the bacon inside seemed a bit over cooked, as were the side of potatoes which made it difficult to eat. (See my photo and you'll understand). \n\nAll in all, it wasn't terrible, it also wasn't the best. Great prices so that's a plus. But there are better options for breakfast around town."

            "review": "I really wanted to like this place!\n\nWalked in and was immediately transported back to Woodbury, New Jersey!  Smells exactly like a NJ diner!  Made me smile & homesick all at once!  Hostess greeted/seated us with a warm greeting! \nPlace was fairly full, but we were seated right away.  It's a good sign for a Wednesday morning!\n\nPot-o-bread - Was expecting a typical fresh, doughy bread like you'd get at dinner. However, it was a like a light, moist pastry type \"bread\", which was a perfect side for breakfast.  Don't hesitate to try it for fear of filling up before the main course!\n\nBelgium Waffle & fruit & coffee - I got the half order.  My honest opinion is that I've had better Belgium waffles.  This one had good flavor, but it was unusually thin for a Belgium and surprisingly  \"tough\" to cut with a fork.\n\nSignature omelet w/well done hash browns, ice water- the husband got this for breakfast. He specifically requested \"well done\" hash browns.  What he got, tho, were actually lightly browned & under cooked.  He was not happy.  He scraped off the sauce on top of the omelette as he said it has way too much tarragon and the consistency was \"gelatinous\".  He said the actual omelette had little flavor and he had to douse it in hot sauce.\n\nThe bill was under $20.  Fair for the amount of food."

We were treated kindly, respectfully, and promptly.\n\nAs a vegetarian Jamms let me subsitute vegetables for meat ingredients at no extra charge.\n\nWe all ordered different types of food. I ordered breakfast and some of my family members ordered lunch entrees. The portions were enormous!!! I noted that I would take a to go box for my omelette I would be able to eat off of for the next couple of days :-)\n\nAll servers and workers make patrons feel as though they are \" regular\" customers.\n\nThey also give a small discount if you post on social media which shows they are in touch with the social media aspect of our culture.\n\nIf you are looking for a casual, cool place to eat that has a down home feeling , I would highly recommend this place! Definitely will return."

The waitress, Carol Ann, my friend, had to pry the plate out of my clenched fists. I had already licked the top clean, but she had a point, no need to lick the bottom. BTW, Carol Ann is an atrocious spellern"

How is that even possible? I think they need to reassess their decision. They might have been good in 2014, but not now."

My Jamm's steak omelet was very tasty with fluffy eggs and the home fries were seasoned well and didn't skimp on the portion. My husband's chicken fried steak, home fries and 3 eggs over easy were equally as delicious.  The cinnamon raisin pot of bread was tasty and tender. His ice tea and my coffee were never empty.\nOur wait time was nil as we were seated as soon as we arrived at 10:30 on a Wed. We will definitely be going back as there are many more dishes we want to try."

The sandwich was pretty tasty. The pastrami was good, but they were real skimpy with the pastrami.  They had a total of 4 slices of pastrami...  When I was served the sandwich I had to lift the top piece of bread to see the pastrami.  \n\nWhen I eat a rueben I want layers of pastarmi, kraut and dressing slopping out the back of the sandwich when I eat it.  \n\nI like the place and I will probably end up there eating breakfast sometime..."
