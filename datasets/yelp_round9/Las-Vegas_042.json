            "review": "Jean Georges is a favorite restaurant in New York, but I was dubious about yet another top name chef doing a Vegas steakhouse. But everything was great, and as it turned out no one had steak. The highlight was the teriyaki short ribs, which were like candy on the outside. The wine list is expensive, but there are a few hidden gems."

I had the Sea bass, it was over cooked and too salty, and send it back. My wife had the NY strip, I ordered one to replace my fish.  They were not cooked evenly, and were a little dry.  I know steak houses use a laser to check temperature. If your job is working the grill in a steakhouse, you should be able to cook a perfect steak be sight and touch.  Come on, in a restaurant in Aria charging $50/ entree, I shouldn't be complaining about the preparation of our meal."

Also, a really fantastic salad.  I had the wedge and it was incredible!\n\nI did not care for the appetizers - we had seafood samplers and a fried mozzarella.  The fried mozzarella had a burnt taste so I think it was fried too long.  Would have been happy with bowling alley cheesesticks.   : )\n\nAnyways, worth a visit for fine dining!"

            "review": "Restaurant Week Menu\n\n - Romaine And Arugula Salad | Avocado And Spicy Corn Vinaigrette\nSmall serving size was my first impression of this appetizer, but then at a steak house you dont really go for the salads. \n\nNot a lot of Avocado, i recall noticing about two or three chunks. A little more avocado would have been nice but with the serving size one extra chunk would have done it but three chunks would have been too much avocado. \n\nThe vinaigrette had a pronounced spicy kick to it. I had forgotten it was even suppose to be spicy as i was interested in this only because i'm a huge fan of arugula. In the end it complemented the salad quite nicely as the sweetness of heirloom cherry sized tomatoes balanced it out quite nicely. \n\n\n- Grass Fed Paso Prime New York Strip | Smokey Tomato Compote, Herbal Spinach And Crunchy Potato\nThe smokey tomato compote was excellent, just truly excellent. What ever it touched it gave off a sweet yet smokey tomato flavor; with the steak: totally awesome! with the crunchy potato: hey you got adult fries and ketchup! with the spinach very nice indeed. I'd love to have a jar of this stuff so i can eat it with anything.\n\nTo be honest, i didnt taste anything herbal about the herbal spinach at all. It was just a hair on the salty side and tasted like any cooked spinach side with just a bit of garlic to it. Nothing special but nothing holding it back either. \n\nThe NY Strip was a very uniformed cut and didnt look like any traditional NY Strip i commonly see. There was no strip of tendon and fat on the sides which was unfortunate for me as i do enjoy the tendon, gives it a chewy texture which is nice when the cuts are on the large or thick side. The quality of the steak was superb as well as the requested temperature, which was medium rare btw. Overall seasonings could have been improved. There was nothing about this steak that impressed me or made the dining experience worth it other than it being of a much higher upscale restaurant grade cut. \n\n\n- Warm Chocolate Cake | Vanilla Ice Cream\nNothing really stood out from this dessert. It's basically your average chocolate cake that's still runny in the middle served with ice cream. Nothing special, nothing just jumps up and wows you. \n\n\nI see restaurant week as an opportunity as a local to try out restaurants i normally dont even consider going to. If you're a tourist or not a Las Vegas local reading this review then i urge you to ignore everything i typed and go here, you'll have a great time. In my prospective, the only item that was served that truely wowed me was the smokey tomato compote. Everything else i give credit to the establishment for having quality ingredients and talented staff but the bang to buck ratio did not meet my expectations.\n\nYelp 100 - 042 of 100"

            "review": "Extremely dissapointing. With the variety of steakhouses advertised on the strip, I picked this once since I stayed at the Aria. Looks fancy from the outside but inside it looks no better than a basic pub with very dim lights. Not very luxurious for a restaurant of this caliber. Cold tables with no tablecloths, and they don't enforce a proper dress code, so if you prefer to look nice, theres people nearby with tshirts and shorts. I ordered a Filet mignon and for an entre, the portion looked like an appetizer at best, and all you get is the meat, nothin else on the plate. I asked the manager why it took a full hour for the entres to arrive and he said that per health dept, all meat is from the freezer and takes longer than normal to fully cook. They weren't busy at all and there were like 10 waiters hovering around, but the service was terrible as it took 30+ min to get the salad, which was far from restaurant quality. So the food, service, and ambience was a terrible letdown. The hotel's restaurants are sorted by classes and I am shocked Jean George's made it into the prestige section. Avoid at all costs."

We started with a shrimp cocktail which was pretty good, then we had a Caesar salad which was pretty standard.  After the salad we had our steak which was quite a disappointment. We finished with a chocolate cake (again very ordinary). I was very disappointed!!!"

            "review": "The thing about Vegas is that there are tons of great food places, so I'm always blown away by the food.  The ambiance and the service was excellent here, but the food was only okay.  I'd give it 3.5 stars.  Here are my thoughts:\n\nService: 4 stars\nWe had a great waiter and I wanted to become best friends with one of the staff members.  Because we had to wait so long for some food to come out, he gave us some complimentary wedge salads.  We also got asked a bunch of trivia questions and if we got them right we got free molten lava cake desserts.  Probably because they had extras (our desserts said Congratulations! on them yet we were celebrating nothing) - but hey, a free delicious dessert is a free delicious dessert.  My one complaint was that we didn't eat THAT much food, but our meal lasted over 3 hours long.\n\nAmbiance: 5 stars\nLoved the decor - confused a bit about the lit walls and what that design is (it's on the menus too).  Not too dimly lit like some restaurants.  I was happy I could still see my friends I was dining with.\n\nFood: 3 stars\nWe got a bunch of food.  Like a lot.\n+ I forget what wine we got but we got a Malbec for $42 that was decent.\n+ Oysters - excellent.  Half a dozen for $20 is about standard. \n+ Tuna tartare ($20) - not bad, but I've definitely had better. \n- Pork belly spring rolls ($20) - not great.  The sauce was overpowering, and two tiny egg rolls essentially (fried - so not spring rolls like advertised), and the pork belly was just okay.  Not really worth my stomach filling up for.\n+ Spinach salad ($14) - I'm in love with goat cheese (which was the dressing) and bacon - big fan\n+ Wedge salads (free for us) - I usually dislike bleu cheese, but this dressing was mild enough for me to enjoy.\n- Porterhouse steak $60) - ordered it medium rare - I think the order must have messed up because it took quite some time to come out (hence the free salads maybe?).  My portion was a bit charred and underwhelming.  Not great tasting to be honest.\n+ Chilean sea bass ($42) - small portion for the price.  Came with a bunch of sauces though and I must say the miso-butter sauce complemented this really well.  The shiitake mushrooms were roasted pretty darn good too.\n- Black truffle and comte fritter ($12) - underwhelming.  Cheese wasn't gooey enough and truffle taste wasn't as strong as expected.  Waiter said it comes with 7 balls - we got 8.  Score?\n+ Bone marrow ($16) - pretty darn good.  Wish there was more.\nMolten lava cake (free for us) - amazing.  Rich, perfectly balanced with the homemade vanilla bean ice cream.\n\nSome of the food was decent, but I would say I have had better and that for the price we paid, it wasn't extraordinary.  I happened to see Michael Phelps here during our meal and have talked more about that then the actual food.  Granted, he could be yummy in his own sense I suppose :D"

Ben& Borris were off the charts and even brought us a special desert as we were celebrating our anniversary. We both had the filet, which was great and I highly recommend the fried potato dish. But what pushes them over the top (besides the service) was the sauces!!! The steak is so good it doesn't need sauce. But the sauces are so creative that the beg to be eaten!  We will Definitely come back!"

            "review": "Jean Georges Steakhouse deserves 4.5 stars but I'll happily round up to 5 because of the generous servings of truffles :) \n\nOn Saturday night, we asked for the last possible reservation which was 10:45 pm. When in Vegas, I like to do everything late :) Maybe the somewhat loud music was also because it was later in the evening? \n\nA lot of different servers came to our table which was a little confusing but maybe they were just trying to move us out more quickly? We started with a yummy bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and the tuna tartar and lobster bisque as appetizers. These, along with the bread selection including \"pretzel bread\" were a great start to a great meal. \n\nWe ended up choosing the salmon with truffle vinegarette to share as a main dish. The salmon was almost sashimi-rare and was delicious especially with the truffle vinegarette on top. This dish also came with chopped up brussel sprouts which I loved and special mashed potatoes that I'm pretty sure also had truffles in them. Have I mentioned that I love truffles and feel so spoiled every time I eat them?! The bone marrow was also very good and so salty. We had to ask for advice on how to eat it...\n\nWe were too stuffed for dessert and actually took our last glass of wine down to the casino floor with us since we didn't want to make all the servers wait for us to finish it... \n\nOne final thought =  yummy truffles!!! :)"

            "review": "This place is VERY pricey, but totally worth it; especially if you need somewhere nice for a special occasion.  I ate here awhile back, and am just getting to sit down to write the review; but I do recall that everything was phenomenal.  \n1) The atmosphere is very sexy, dark lighting, and not fit for casual attire.  So to you Las vegas tourists: DO NOT go to this place in your half-wrapped towel, flip-flops, and swim attire after you've left the party pools (haha).  Ladies and Gents, don't be afraid to put on that nice sheath dress/or that tailored suit you've been wanting to wear; but have been saving for a special night.  It'll work out just fine here!\n2) The cocktail menu is a decent size with unique and interesting specialties, and the beer selection isn't bad either.  I ordered The Diablo cocktail (I like a little spice), and I had no complaints.  The wine list is quite impressive as you can imagine as well. On to the food:\n\nWe ordered the Jumbo shrimp cocktail (which is hard to mess up in fine-dining), and oysters on the half-shell (which I look for anywhere I go). Both dishes were fresh, and I had to stop myself from ordering more oysters (haha). For dinner I ordered the Wagyu filet, and the table ordered sides of mushrooms, brussel sprouts, and the truffle mac and cheese.  No complaints with anything, and the filet was like BUTTER! It was cooked to perfection (MR), and was sooooo tender.  My favorite side was the brussel sprouts with pecan and avocado (the pecans complimented the sprouts so well!).  If you have the money to check this place out and throw-down almost $70 for a steak; this is the place to do it!"

I heard a lot of good things about the Jean George in New York and was hoping that this would be a similar experience. The ambiance was great, a typical steakhouse, a little more elegant than StripSteak in Vegas but nothing over the top.\n\nwe decided on the 6 course prefixe for 125.00 pp. so we can get a little-of-this-and-a-little-of-that. I never done a prefix at a steakhouse b/c i'm usually just dialed in which 'cut' i want more and maybe a side of lobster mac'n'cheese so this was a good deviation. \n\n* OSETRA CAVIAR - soooo good, i wanted another round of this..a bit of tart w/ salty goodness\n* TUNA TARTARE - pretty standard tartare - does the job\n* AUTUMN FRUITS - burrata cheese - not a fan\n* SEARED DIVER SCALLOPS - really good, had a small hint of asian flavors like the viet fish sauce\n* GRILLED WAGYU FILET MIGNON - amazing, i didnt expect that the tasting menu's steak would be so tender. had another touch of asian marinade flavors..loved this\n* PEANUT BUTTER BROWNIE SUNDAE - wayyyyyyyyyy toooo sweet and i love dessert and peanut butter but i felt a small heart clog with this...\n\nwell done Jean George!!!\n\nuntil next time space cowboy...."

Jean Gorges' \"thing\" is the sauces. Your steak is served with five different sauces to choose from. \n\nIf you like a steak with its own flavor, this is not your steakhouse.\nIf you like a steak with sauce, this is definitely your place to dine. \n\nPlain mashed potatoes were quite poor. They were the consistency of paste and only tasted okay. Asparagus was delish.\n\nFinally, I have to say that of the four steaks we ordered, not one came cooked to our specifications. The medium-wells were far too rare. The medium-rares were far too over-cooked. Hmm...\n\nWould we visit here again? Maybe with a side of \"probably not.\""

Bartender was a great server and very informative with drink recommendations (got a local beer on tap, which was very good). Was there for the $69 early evening dinner, available 5-7pm daily: appetizer (went with the caesar salad), main (got the 8oz filet mignon), dessert (warm chocolate cake with ice cream). The caesar was average at best. The filet mignon was very good especially with the array of sauces provided (complementary). The chocolate cake was nothing special. \n\nOK value even for the $69 price. As expected, service was impeccable. The restaurant space itself was beautiful - dark but modern and clean.

The sauces that accompanied were a pleasant surprise though -- great steak doesn't need sauce, but when it does need it, it's nice to have a good selection. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind, if you've ever been tempted to take up a restaurant staff's offer of taking a picture of you and your date over dinner.... don't do it here. It's standard practice to conveniently refrain from quoting a price until after they've already made the prints and put them in a nice folder, but brace yourself for JG. 70 bucks?

I think I waited 30 minutes for my check to be delivered. \n\nThis place isn't cheap. If I had it to do over again I'd probably go up the strip a bit to Gordon Ramsay Steak and get a better meal for less money. Not that GR is inexpensive by any measure."

I have tried a number of steakhouses in town, and JG at the Aria is easily one of the very best. We have tried the Short Rib, the fritters, the Tomahawk steak, the burger, and more.Everything we have had has been fantastic. The wine list is exceptional, and our experience with the service has been very good as well.\nI will go back, whenever I am ready for a really special meal."

I've followed chef Robert Moore since his day at Prime, Bellagio. My parents also celebrated their anniversary at Prime when Chef Moore was there. This anniversary, my parents wanted to come here after seeing countless of my yummy pictures.\n\n          My broski family also joined us. We got lucky with a gorgeous booth in the back, separated from the rest of the adult crowd, so my nieces & I could be loud! (OK, so just me that was loud!)\n\n          Another sommelier Jeff was there to help me with my wine pairing, after a quick talk, he was at many restos that I'd been too, how cool is that?

Perfectly pairing with the Sauternes, or 2005 Maculan Torcolato - Italy, Veneto, Breganze!\n\n- Bacon wrapped shrimp papaya mustard cilantro - what a lovely combination, you can't go wrong with this! My nieces 11 & 7 enjoyed this a lot or anything with bacon in it ;-)\n\nENTR\u00c9ES:\n- Soy-glazed short rib apple-jalapeno puree rosemary crumbs - since my sister in law loved everything that cooked well, nothing better than this 8 hours cooked short rib!\n\n- Australian lobster tail - special on the menu, my dad went for it.\n\n- Kobe cheeseburger miso russian dressing yuzu pickles - my broksi dish - got to see see the cheese melted on the beef, so juicy.

The bar is really cozy and the bartender was very accommodating as he didn't get my drink right and took the initiative to try again until getting it right!  When we sat at the table the service was quick with waters and menus. We ordered 2 bottles of pricey wines (hard to find anything decent under &100) and apps and dinner. Squash soup was very good, Tuna tartare was good but certainly not the best I'd tasted. My table all ordered steak which was average tasting for a high end steak house. I ordered the sea bass with a side dish of mushrooms. Sea bass was not great. It was dry, came with no sauce.  The sea bass with miso at the Yard House is better - at least it has a nice broth and some bok Choy. When it arrived it actually already came with a little bunch of mushrooms.  The waiter didn't mention it already came with mushrooms while taking my side order of mushrooms.  When I pointed out that if I had known it came with mushrooms I wouldn't have ordered a side of mushrooms his response was \"well it says on the menu that it comes with mushrooms\". We were all very taken aback as when you are paying the prices we paid I would have expected the waiter to say \"what other side can I bring you\"?  Instead they said they would take them off the bill but we're also going to take them away without offering any other option. This was just bad bad service for such a high restaurant. We were all shocked by the way two waiters reacted that it really left a bad taste in our mouths. The night before we had eaten at Picasso at Bellagio and the service was 10 times better as was the food. He food and the service at this restaurant aren't memorable but it is a nice environment."

My steak was ice cold when it arrived at the table.  After waiting for almost an hour and a half for our entrees to arrive, that sad slab of NY strip was just intolerable.  \n\nSimilarly disappointing: the quality of the ingredients they serve - they list their steaks as \"prime\" on the menu, but they're  wet-aged (not dry aged), a fact that is only revealed if you hound your waiter to admit it.  The lobster is rock lobster from Australia.  Hello?  We have perfectly amazing lobster in the States - it comes from Maine and it's far superior.  Last but not least:  Australian \"Wagyu\" (or \"wayygoo,\" as our waitress kept misstating) is not, in fact, the real McCoy.  These days you have to travel to Japan and/or have some serious import connections to find actual Kobe beef.  \n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if this place closes  when JG's contract with MGM expires.  Atrocious, badly-sourced/misrepresented food for the price."

I was staying at the Mandarin and had planned to go to Ruth's Chris, but wanted something new and found this place. I tried to find a menu, or just some ideas on the prices, but didn't, but went anyway, alone.\n\nMy reservation was for 6 p.m. and I had my ribeye at 6:30 (and out the door at 7:15). Great service. I had the 18-ounce ribeye ($68), a wedge salad, and an apple pie dessert. Plus Pellegrino. The salad and dessert were fine, the ribeye was sublime. I used to cook \"professionally\" (okay, it was Golden Corral) and have been a steak connoisseur for many years. Trust me, this ribeye was extraordinary. \n\nI love ribeye but hate having a small pile of fat left over. That wasn't the case with this cut. MAYBE I actually consumed more fat than I usually would (my table wasn't exceptionally well lit), but it didn't seem like it. It had a perfect partial sear for that semi-crusty exterior and it was a perfect medium. So flavorful. I almost never put anything on my steaks, but the salsa verde that came with it was a revelation. There were four other sauces and they were fine. I ate probably 1/3 of the meat without anything. \n\nTwo nights before this meal I dined at Smith and Wollensky, where I also had a large ribeye. It was much better at Jean Georges.  \n\nI hope to visit Jean Georges again."

Well marinated and extremely tender. I asked for mine to be cooked medium rare and the chef cooked it to perfection! It was so tasty on its own but the steak still came with 5 different sauces, all which were enjoyable but the employees recommended the butter miso, I believe? But it was again, amazing and great recommendation -- it was my favorite. It complimented the steak so well.\n\nService was top notch. I can't even favor anyone because everyone was so helpful. My main server (forgot his name) stated all the specials for tonight and recommended the perfect wine for me, the rose lucien. Waters were filled constantly, manager hung up my sweater for me, all in all such an amazing place to eat and finish off our trip. Next time I come back to Vegas, I will definitely be back!"

I did a fair amount of asking around, and I was staying at Aria so I wanted to check out Jean Georges. I was a single diner and sat at the bar. Gary was great at the bar. Enjoyed his company throughout dinner, and he provided great service. \n\nPlenty of comments about the ambiance on here...dark decor, classic steakhouse feel. Full disclosure - I never left the bar area (which did have a TV for watching games). \n\nOn to food and drink reviews. Cocktail menu...I didn't look any further when I saw a Boulevardier on the menu, I'm a sucker for it. One of my favorite cocktails. It was good. Personal preference is Campari over the Aperol. Also prefer to be served neat/up instead of on the rocks. \n\nI also hadn't eaten much that day so went for the tasting menu. First course was caviar dish served over a lemon gelatin. This one didn't really do it for me. Never fair to compare anyone to French Laundry, but I found myself longing for the \"Oysters and Pearls\" caviar dish from French Laundry. Next dish was the tuna tartare. Presentation was great on this one with the tall rice. Really enjoyed this one. Next was the burrata and fruits. I love burrata! Delicious. Could have done without so many apples and more burrata, but I also enjoyed this. Next up was the seared diver scallop. I don't eat scallops as often. Was good but wasn't out of this world. 3.5-4 stars out of 5. The dish I was most interested in trying was the Wagyu beef tenderloin. The steak was cooked perfectly (Medium-rare), so I appreciated that. I could tell the flavor was there. Where I left feeling disappointed in this one was the asian glaze, sauce that was distracting me from the great cut of beef sitting in front of me. I found myself trying to get the steak out of the sauce on the plate to not overpower what should be shining here. Found myself wishing I may have just gone with the large bone in ribeye instead. Lastly, the dessert was also delicious with a peanut butter brownie sundae. Very rich - couldn't finish it all at this point in the meal. \n\nIn conclusion, I'd come back here again, but I would be sure to pay attention to how they were preparing and serving the steak. I want it to be simple but delicious rather than distracting. Appreciate the great service!"

It really did remind me of a native American tomahawk axe and it was cooked (rare plus) to perfection.  In terms of size, the steak was generous.  It was in between a 4x6 and a 5x7 postcard and was about 1\" thick.  \n\nThe verdict: Would I go back?  Yes.

I have never tasted something so delcious!  The ingredients were combined beautifully and we devoured every last morsel.  The tartare was served with an asian prawn cracker (they call it puffed rice cracker)  and probably should've came with 2 crackers to even out the tuna to cracker ratio.  \n\nThe 3 of us opted for the 8oz Filet Mignon and our friend ordered the 18 Oz. Ribeye.  Let me tell you, I usually do not order the filet mignon but this one was to DIE for.  The meat was sooo tender and incredibly juicy.  I looooved the sauce that accompanied it (some green mint sauce).  The steaks were also served with a three pepper marmalade, soy-miso butter, bernaise, and a JG steak sauce.  I tried all sauces (I'm a saucy girl), but found myself to go back to that mysterious green sauce.  \n\nFor sides, we shared the black truffle & comte fritter, which was kinda like a lil jalapeno popper...but klassier, roasted royal trumpet mushrooms, and good ol' mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  All equally delicious, but the main star of the night were the steaks.  \n\nMy friend who ordered the 16 oz. ribeye took his leftovers home and we microwaved it and ate it the next morning.  It still tasted delish!  \n\nWe ended the night with coffee, tea and shared the warm chocolate cake.  The chocolate cake was warm and gooey in the center..kinda like a lava cake with yummy vanilla bean ice cream on the side.  \n\nGetting a 3 of a kind in 3 card poker = FREE DELICIOUS MEAL FOR ALL :)"

We had made a reservation and were seated promptly. (Some reviews mentioned don't even bother walking in without one!)\nThe service was generally good and helpful. We ordered the JG burger and ribeye steak along with a bottle of wine, black truffle comte fritters and lobster mash potatoes.\nOverall, this was a very good burger but it lacked the \"wow\" I was expecting given the price and the fame of the chef. It was prepared just as I requested and arrived nice and neatly presented. The meat was flavorful, juicy and glowed with that wonderful medium rare pinkness. The bun was nice and fresh, but perhaps fewer sesame seeds could be better (there were a lot!).\nThe burger came with delicious fries and for once I didn't even have to ask for ketchup! In short, the burger was quite satisfying, definitely one of the better ones I had, but once again, it didn't quite amaze me which I had hoped for. Even so, paired with wine and the other sides we ordered, the burger made a very good dinner.\nThe ribeye was similar, well prepared, delicious and savory but short of amazing. The sides were perhaps the best part of the meal and the most savory. The restaurant certainly lives up to its $$$$ rating so be prepared to spend.\nHaving dined at Jean George's other restaurants in NYC, this is a good place but not excellent and does not quite match the level of his other establishments."

I had eaten here before and had a positive experience the last time around, but it was even better today.\n\nThere were four courses provided with a choice for three of them.  The meal started out with the tomato gazpacho which was pretty tasty.  I appreciated the cool temperature of the soup, especially on such a hot day in Vegas.  \n\nThe heirloom tomato panzanella salad came next and was pretty darn good.  All of the ingredients were fresh and the star of the dish, the tomatoes, were sweet and juicy and there were a good amount of them in the dish.  The only issue I had with the dish was that the dried bread chunks were a bit too big and should have been cut a little smaller since it was kind of a pain to cut them into bite sized pieces with the butter knife.\n\nI opted for the medium-rare cooked filet mignon which was accompanied with mustard greens and topped with some fine curly, string onions.  There was a cherry mustard sauce which packed an nice punch.  I could have done without the onions and the steak was the weakest link of the meal, but it was still pretty good.\n\nI opted for the bone marrow sides which was very interesting.  Three half bones cut lengthwise exposed the marrow, and a spoon was used to scoop out the marrow to apply on a small slab of toasted bread and parsley lemon gremolata was added to top it off.  The bone marrow itself didn't do much for me - it was kind of tasteless to me and the purpose seemed to be to just leave an oily residue on the bread to make it a little soggy but the gremolata was pretty delicious and made the dish work.\n\nFor the dessert, I opted for the white chocolate pavlova which was a real winner.  The crust had a nice delicate texture that melted in my mouth.  I typically go for sweet desserts but the meringue was nice and delicate and overall it was a very interesting dish.  \n\nService was great and my server Eddie was knowledgeable and friendly.  The bill totalled ~ $100 but it was well worth it."

Needless to say we did not get a drink before sitting at our table. We ordered an appetizer, salad and shared a main entree. It took 45 minutes for our medium rare steak to arrive at our table from when our salads were cleared and it was still under cooked.

Calamari was cooked perfectly\n2. The sauces for the steaks were delicious. My fave were the habenero better and bearnaise\n\nIntolerable (please noted I have high expectations, when I'm paying $130+ per person)\n1. Service was horrible. Our busser/runner (Boris) was much attentive tha. Our server. \n2. Our server removed my husband empty soda, without asking if he wanted another one. It took us 15 minutes, to track him down to find out what happened. When we did, his response was that he took it away becausw it was empty and they don't offer refills. (Let sit on that a minute. Why wouldn't you ask your guest if they'd like another one?! Did you assumed that they wouldn't be able to afford another $4.50 soda, even thought they are paying $130 per person. Or was it because they didn't order alcohol? We don't drink so why would we order alcohol?! \n3. Our steaks were over cooked. My husband ordered medium rare and for medium. I ordered medium well and got well done and burnt. Normally I'm fine with that but the steak was tough and not what I expected from a premium steak house\n4. We all had more they half our meal left and the servicer did ask if we'd like to pack it to go. (Every restaurant ask this but they guy just didn't care)\n\nOverall, I will never come here again. Gordon Ramsey is well above the bar, that it makes this place looks like a cheap road side cafe. Gordon Ramsey is always booked but worth the wait. They are attentive and your drink is never empty. They bussed is so quite and quick, they anticipated the needs of their guest and take a care of it with you asking."

We were so full after the apps we all had leftovers and I forgot to take pictures! Based on my party they loved the steak, the salads, I believe they also had bone marrow.

From the stunningly dark, sexy room, to the phenomenal - let me repeat, absolutely phenomenal service, to the incredible meal; Jean Georges Steakhouse is at the top of my list for Las Vegas Steakhouses.\n\nWe booked in for a Saturday night meal for 8 of us to celebrate my hubbys Birthday and I am so glad we chose this spot. It was fun, upscale yet comfortable. Not too loud that we couldn't have a conversation as a table. The wait staff works as a team to make sure you are well taken care of. We never had to reach for the bottle of wine, our glass was always being topped up, and when the bottle was near empty, another was there to replace it. The bread to start is very good - I am picky and loooove good bread!. Then the meal, wow. Mouth watering good. I opted for the seafood platter while most went for steak and my Father-in-law went with the sea bass. Not a single complaint... well, we did all think that the side dishes of asparagus, brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes and mac n cheese were all a bit small. For $16 a side, they should be a bit more significant. All though if it's a meal for two, I guess they would be fine. \n\nThey had a photographer that came out to take pictures, and a lava cake on the house with Happy Birthday written on it. All in all, it was just a wonderful evening and I am so thankful we chose it. I would 100% go back."

Great food, impeccable service, and killer vibes nicely prime the evening for whatever could be next on your Vegas lineup.\n\nAtmosphere: Mood is EVERYTHING here. Dark, gorgeous, and sexy. Perfect especially for a date night. Electronic chill music leaves things low key and calm while also keeping the energy flowing.\n\nCustomer Service: World class from start to finish and probably what sets JG apart from other steakhouses I've dined at on the strip. With sincerity, the customer service here surpasses many Michelin star restaurants I've visited. Hostesses are warm, food servers are friendly and genuine, and managers with a calm presence graciously came by to check on us during our meal. Every dish was explained along the way. \n\nFood:\nBread- Four options with a salted butter. Perfect for those like me who revel in the bread basket just as much as they do the actual dishes.\n\nCaesar salad- the kitchen split our salad for us, and it was plenty to share between two as a starter. Nice lemony touch and chopped to small bites, which is much appreciated. \n\nBone marrow- the GM generously shared a few bonuses with us, to include this one. Presentation has a solid \"wow\" factor! Of note: bone marrow portion itself is quite small and enough to enjoy on two pieces of toast with a very tasty, vibrant gremolata.\n\nSteak- NY strip was cooked to perfection and served with several sauces, which were all explained by the great staff.\n\nSides- We had the creamed kale, truffle mac and cheese, and asparagus. Absolutely LOVED the creamed kale and asparagus. Truffle mac and cheese was enjoyable but less exciting than I imagined it to be. Be careful when ordering the first two though- they were pretty heavy on the salt.\n\nDessert- We had the cheesecake and chocolate cake! Beautiful presentations with multiple creative components. Best when paired with a coffee. :) \n\nDining on the strip tends to be inflated, but when you are deciding on where to eat, I can suggest JG as a cut above the rest because of the service; while the food is delicious and great quality, the five-star staff makes this place more of an experience and not just a meal!"

However, if you're going to call yourself a fine dining establishment the service needs to greatly improve. It really made this a poor dining experience. \n\nMy husband and I took my mom to celebrate her 60th birthday. She seldom gets to go to nice restaurants so this was supposed to be a treat. It was some of the most terrible service we have ever received at a fine dining restaurant. Definitely not what we expect of a Jean Georges establishment.\n\nMy mom eats a bit slower than us. Our plates were frequently cleared before she was finished with her course during the tasting menu. This made everything feel very rushed. There was one course where she still had fork in hand and was chewing and they tried to clear her plate. I had to actually reach out and grab it and let them know she wasn't done. There was clearly still food remaining.\n\nWe frequently didn't have our next course of wine poured until the course had already been served. We also asked for some additional details regarding one of the courses and the server had no idea. He gave us some ingredients which were clearly what we had eaten in the last course.\n\nEveryone was friendly, but they tried their best to rush us through. Honestly, the service was equivalent to what we would get at a big chain restaurant. It was incredibly disappointing. There are many other options in Vegas with equivalent food and much better service."

We came in for a late dinner and was taken care of with meticulous hospitality. \n\nTo start we ordered the oysters rockafeller and the crab cake. The portion sizes are not large. It is just a taste. Both were sensational. They were running a special on an Australian bone in 30 ounce ribeye which is raised similar to wagyu. We got one of those and their regular ribeye off the menu to compare. The marbling and tenderness of the Australian definitely stood out. It warranted the price as well. The sides were a letdown though. The mushrooms in goat cheese and bone marrow were not outstanding. The latter was underwhelming in the fact that it was so sparse. There was hardly anything to scoop up. The garlic spread that accompany it was the highlight. The pairing was intended to cut the rich fattiness of the bone marrow. Instead I used it for the ribeyes with the same intention.\n\nNow this is where it got crazy. As the servers heard my friends wish me a happy birthday John G. prepared for a tour of the restaurant. After that we had to try some desserts. We got the churros with three different dipping sauces; strawberry, chocolate, and dulce de leche. It was good on its own or with the last sauce. The lava cake is JG's specialty. Apparently he came up with this signature dessert. It was the perfect portion. I could not see eating anything bigger. The strawberry rhubarb cobbler with pistachio ice cream is out of this world. The lattice work on top is gorgeous and every component meshed together well. Then there was the caramel sundae with the best caramel corn. The popcorn is served warm and it contrasts so well to the cold ice cream. I was on a sugar high and loving it. \n\nI might not have been blown away by everything, but it was a solid dinner."

Baked potato soaked in salt and this is supposed to be gourmet.. Overall the food was a complete disappointment, service lacked horribly and the interior was nothing impressive either. After experiencing the food and ambiance of the SW at Wynn, Jean Georges is miles away.\nThere were 8 of us and we couldn't wait to leave the place.\nOh, they were more expensive on every single dish than most of the really high end steak houses !!

            "review": "Dining on Las Vegas Boulevard can be a different kind of gamble than most patrons are used to experiencing. Do you hedge your bets and save money by going to the buffet that was last cleared by the health inspector in 1973, or do you spend massive amounts of money on fine dining that is so snooty they charge you to use the bathroom while never making eye contact with you? It's a risky venture but if there is one place on The Strip that is a guaranteed jackpot visit for you and your dining party, it has to be Jean Georges Steakhouse. The reasons are many, but if you are the kind of Las Vegas visitor who wants the quick-and-easy soundbites for your adventures, trust me when I say this is worth the time and asking price.\n\nFor the rest of us still reading, I'll recap my visit whilst wiping the drool from my mouth as I fondly reminisce about some of these dishes.\n\nMy folks and I were looking for a nice steakhouse to close out our last night in town. And being that this was downstairs from our rooms in the ARIA, it was an easy reservation to make. But even without the convenience of proximity, Jean Georges is more than worthy of visiting. When we walked in, the duo of hostesses at the front desk greeted us and escorted us through the dining room to a banquette seat along the back wall. Along the way, we passed through a classy bar area, as well as a couple of dining rooms flanked with booths, tables and the most inviting atmosphere of any upscale dining I have seen in Vegas.\n\nAlmost seconds after being seated, Jason came by and welcomed us. Much like the hostesses, Jason was professional, engaging and fully committed to making sure each guest had their expectations exceeded. Since this was our first visit, and I tend to get confused by concepts like revolving doors, we appreciated the overview of the menu Jason provided. I especially was relieved to find out the sigils lining the walls are cow noses - you can totally see that when someone points it out to you. (I spent the first 20 minutes here thinking they were an abstract interpretation of Monument Valley.)\n\nWith generously poured cocktails in hand, we set our sights on the food. Mom opted for the butternut squash soup and soy-glazed short rib, Dad chowed down on the caesar salad and wagyu filet, and I decided to attempt cardiac arrest with the bacon-wrapped shrimp and 18-oz. ribeye. In most reviews, I would take the time to itemize each item and give the pros and/or cons, stretching the total word count to somewhere around the 600,000 word total. But everything here was impossibly wonderful. Truthfully, it started with the complimentary basket of breads, stuffed with everything from pretzel rolls to something I forgot the name of from Morocco that engulfed my taste buds in flavor and fire. Even the side orders of asparagus and fries met with our voracious appetites.\n\n(And special note must be made for the quartet of steak sauces brought out - while two were better than the others, the fact that there was so much variety to choose from made for a nice addition. However, that green minty sauce that came in its own silo may be the closest thing to a transcendental moment I have experienced - I think the first bite sent me back in time, though that may have been the second house \"mule\" providing the foundation for this out-of-body experience.)\n\nUnfortunately, with food this good, you are going to want to eat as much as possible. Why is this a bad thing? Well, in our case, due to the aftermath of our gorging, none of us had room for dessert. If tradition holds up, though, I'm sure the desserts are awesome.\n\nOther random observations: the bathrooms are kind of cool, in that there are free-standing sinks atop columns in the middle of the floor. There is a photographer wandering the premises to capture your visit, but she was not obtrusive, at all. And whoever picked the soundtrack gets all the points in my book - until coming here, I never realized how cool life could be until I was eating a steak while the Pet Shop Boys' \"West End Girls\" was playing. (Seriously, the mix of current and classic new wave/synth pop music was excellent.)\n\nI have one slight concern to mention, and it's one I typically harp on like a broken record: no manager came by to our table. I'm not even sure if a manager was walking the floor - my back was to the dining room. I'm sure one was making the rounds, though. In a high class steakhouse, I put a lot of value in a managerial presence speaking with the guests, even if it is just to thank them for coming in. It's a slight hiccup, and it's certainly not going to stop me from recommending this place, but it's just a suggestion to the powers that be to maybe have a bit more visibility in the dining room.\n\nAgain, though, that's a minor bump in the road compared to the overall visit we had the pleasure of enjoying. Sure, the pricing may deter some, but Jean Georges Steakhouse is proof you get what you pay for - it is a masterful dining experience."

My in laws ordered 18 OZ BONE-IN RIB EYE, CARAMELIZED DIVER SCALLOPS, and 8 OZ FILET MIGNON. \n\nService *\nThe sommelier (wine steward?) was very knowledgeable. He gave us two recommendations based on our preferences and the rib-eye we ordered. He was also very attentive. \nHowever, our server was not very attentive. For the tasting menu we ordered, he didn't even introduce any dish when he served them. This is the first time that I had tasting menu at a nice restaurant without servers introducing the dishes. It was a little bit disappointing. On top of that, the three sides we ordered didn't come with our entrees. We waited for extra 15 to 20 minutes for the side dishes to come. My in-law had to eat his rib-eye slowly for 20 minutes, waiting for the mashed potato, mushrooms, and asparagus. Very unprofessional. \nFood ***\nThe food was fine, considering how it's priced, I think it can be a little bit better. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the tasting menu. The TUNA TARTARE doesn't taste any different from any regular restaurant. The THREE GRAIN SALAD (Beets, Goat Cheese & Herbs) tasted the same as the one at the Cheesecake Factory (One of my favorite salad there). The scallop dish came with sugar snap peas and vines didn't amaze us, either. \nI would recommend the salmon and the WAGYU TENDERLOIN. The wagyu tenderloin was tender, juicy and full of flavors. The salmon dish was well-presented and it was delicious. It was actually the best salmon I have ever had. Not just the way it was cooked, but also the quality of the fish itself. \n\nOverall **\nWe had our best dining experience at Jean Georges, New York. That's why we were excited to visit its steakhouse in Aria this time. However, it didn't meet our expectations. :("

Service was good but the hostesses at the entrance weren't very friendly.\n\nFood was meh... you can have the same level of food at many other steakhouses for 30 - 50% less the price. As some other reviewer said 'not up to par for the price point'. I don't know if it''s me but the whole ambiance feels cheap.\n\nKind of felt that the portions were smaller than what was advertised.\n\nOn a brighter note the side dishes were very good. Had the Black Truffle Mashed Potatoes (not in the menu), the Grilled Asparagus and the Broiled Bone Marrow.\n\nAll in all we ended up paying $379 (plus tip) for a 3 person dinner."

Not at this price point. \n\nWorse, they don't cook your desk the way you ask for it. They cook it the way they want it done. Why bother to ask if they aren't going to give you what you asked for? Why should a customer paying a high end price not get what they asked for? Inexcusable.\n\nIf you like so-so service, high prices, and a grill cook who ignores your cooking request, then this is the pledge for you! If you want a good meal,there are so many other choices. Why go here? For your sake I urge you to AVOID THIS PLACE."

As a foodie, I never felt I could \"have so much fun\" by all surprisingly great selections of food and amazingly friendly service! Excellent!! \n\nFood- Many choices, creative and beautiful presentations, great quality! Unique display of Tuna Tartare with a big piece of deep fried wavy rice paper- good! Waygu beef capaccio wrapped over crunchy (potato balls?) with truffle oil, topped with basil leafs & dash of some crunchy ingredient on top- must try! Excellent steak & lobster, love the sea bass with yozu mushroom! \n\nDrinks - I had the Ginger Pear cocktail! Very different & unique. Never tasted such before. I requested a lighter touch of the ginger taste, very refreshing and light sweet! I don't like over sweet, so it was perfect! Wine of coz is excellent!\n\nDessert- we were so full, but still! Killed the chocolate lava cake (it's so different- the best I had!- just got told by the manager Jean Philip is actually the \"inventer\"!!!) & their special Churro tossed w/ caramelized bananas & vanilla icecream & peanuts! \n\nService- beyond excellent! For me, service is the \"most\" important quality as fulfilling customers' satisfaction. Food servers explained politely & warmly in details of plates, ingredient, purposes of different sauces that come w/ the steak. Love the manager Jack who gave great history and background of the restaurant! We customers do love food and do love to know more about the restaurant. They have other concept restaurants in other states & countries like in Trump Tower in NYC, England, and upcoming in Japan! I'm curious now!\n\nAtmosphere- love it! Soft lounge music background, not super causal, but not over formal, perfect for dating, business, and friends gathering! Impressive million dollar wine wall! \n\nEverything was so good! Beyond words! Fun! Loved the service!! \n\nHighlights: Waygu Beef Capaccio, Tuna Tartare, Ginger Pear Cocktail, Sea Bass, desserts - must try Jean Philip's invention- lava cake, special churro with banana and icecream. \n\nThank you manager Jack and food servers (I only remember Eddie and the other lady, sorry for forgetting the name) for such amazingly fun night! \n\nNever write so long!

There were other restaurants in the Aria Hotel and Casino but we thought that we would try a steak dinner. We chose a steak special not on the menu....cured Kobe steak. It was quite good,very lean but full of flavor....and $270 a plate. The steak was great but not so much for that price. Before dinner the waitress handed me a blank menu, and we joked that this must be the diet menu. She apologized and mentioned that the restaurant would take care of our first 2 dinner cocktails. When we got the bill, we noticed that we were charged for the 2 cocktails. We reminded her that she had mentioned that the restaurant would take care of them, but she suddenly didn't recall the offer. It was obvious that she was covering her mistake.\n\nAnyway, I don't think my husband and I will ever come back to this place."

I sat at the bar and I ordered the ginger pear cocktail...very refreshing but very tart that it gave me heartburn. I love vodka and ginger.  Next cocktail moscow mule...hmmm they used a ginger syrup instead of ginger beer. Hollerrrr!!! Love love love!! Great service at the  bar....they weren't very busy at the bar but the rest of the restaurant seemed a bit full. I decided to go with the burger with brie and fries and a side of mayo.  I decided not to go with the filet because I thought it would be too much food. So I think the burger was $25 or $26 and it came with truffle fries and some kind of truffle mayo I believe and the burger had brie and yuzu pickles on it. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium rare. They brought my side of mayo and had gone to the restaurant next door to get it which I thought was nice. The fries came in a small black iron dish with truffles on top...not impressed. I ate around them. I just wanted fries...normal fries. These fries were short and small. I could barely dip them in my mayo and ketchup....ugghhh.  The burger....I am a huge fan of pickles...nice kosher pickles...maybe a little spice to them. These were awful. Didn't taste anything like a pickle. The brie...I love brie...love love love brie, but not on this burger. The meat was dry. I think it was medium rare...looked kinda medium. The place was kinda dark so I couldn't really tell.  Overall, very disappointed with my $25 burger and fries. I think I will stick to the cocktail and steak menu next time.  4 stars for excellent service and nice ambience. This is my second time here and the service is always good."

The plate had ice cream with a candied caramel decoration and a warm chocolate molten lava cake...with a handwritten \"happy anniversary\" in chocolate..it was a TOTAL SURPRISE to my boyfriend and i. i even asked my bf if he had told them to that but he didnt..he just mentioned that it was our anniversary on the reservation though. i think my bf was lying haha ;) \n\noverall, i would def go here again. i think a lot of people have their own strong opinions of places so if youre thinking about taking a risk..then you should def do it with jean georges! service is impeccable, food was delicious and they def treat you like a king and queen. i am so thankful they made our night even more special with that surprise dessert. i give it a thumbs up!"

We really tried to find a nice/elegant restaurant for a special occasion but it seems like people don't like to dress up anymore. I don't care if they have money or not, but at least dress up for dinner. So after the long wait, we were seated only to wait even more time for our server to stop by and say hello. Another 20 minutes had gone by before we been offered a glass of water. By this time I was ready to just leave and talk to the manager on the way out....but like  dummies we stuck around. We finally had the chance to order the food and we decided to do the chef's special of food/wine pairing and of course, they fckd that up too. They brought out the wine either too early or too late and never actually got to taste it with our food. The entire service was horrible and the waiter kept apologizing but nothing changed...he felt he would remedy the situation by bringing us an extra dessert that we didn't want.  We just wanted to leave. We spent close to $500 for the meal for two and it the entire experience SUCKED! Save yourself the money and seriously read the yelp reviews before you go!

So I thought we give this place a try since it's new.  Although, we already know how hard it is to find any steak place better than Mastros or Cut.  But I'm still waiting to find something that I can is better...which Jean-Georges Steakhouse did not even come close.\n\nIt's a really nice place.  I love the decor.  From the moment we spotted the restaurant outside with the amazing decor at the entrance until we were seated at our table, I was truly impressed with the design.  However, I didn't really like the way the tables were set-up.  Considering it was V-day, we were seated right next to two other tables and really didn't get much privacy.\n\nFor appetizers, we shared calamari and bone marrow.  This was literally the best calamari I've ever tasted.  The batter was very light and crisp and it was accompanied by a tasty mayo-like dipping sauce.  The bone marrow was decent, but I have to say Cut and Charlie Palmer prepares this dish much better.  The toast that came with the bone marrow was good though.\n\nWe shared an 18 oz rib-eye and selected the bernaise and soy-butter miso sauce on the side.  The steak was cooked to perfection...I really haven't seen a medium rare steak cooked that way before.  It was very juicy and tender, but it lacked the flavors found at our fav steakhouse - Mastros.  Each steak comes with their house special sauce...which tasted somewhat like salsa verde.  \n\nThe drinks were good and strong.  After two cocktails, we were both feeling quite tipsy. :)\n\nNonetheless, I am still a fan of Jean-Georges and will continue trying his other restaurants.  However, I'm not sure if I really care to return to his Las Vegas location.  Especially when they just opened a Mastros Ocean Club inside the new Crystals at City Center."

Pricey but reflects the quality that it delivers. For the appetizer, my boyfriend and I shared the wagyu beef carpaccio with black truffle fritter and we couldn't stop raving about it. Each bite was like a bit of heaven. I was sad when we finished it. I only wish there was more! But good things come in small packages.\n\nOnto the entree. I had the filet mignon cooked medium rare. It was delicious and extremely tender. I'm drooling as I think about it. The sauces it came with were good. There's one for every mood. I especially enjoyed the soy-miso butter. It complimented the steak well. I love putting sauces in my food, but at times i omitted the sauce and enjoyed the cut the way it was. \n\nMy boyfriend had the bone-in ribeye cooked medium rare. He enjoyed it but thought the filet mignon was betterafter he had a bite of mine! \n\nSides: We ordered a side of truffle mashed potatoes and truffle fries (the special that night). We should've gotten something different because two potato sides proved to be too much to finish. We were stuffed!! Next time, I would get the bone marrow or the brussel sprouts!\n\nNonetheless, I enjoyed everything we ordered. They have a huge wine selection too which is nice. I don't have much to say about this except i liked what I ordered. I would have more appreciation for the extensive wine list if I knew more about wine. \n\nAs for dessert - didn't get any. Too full. I left happy and satisifed :) \n\nI would give it 4.5 stars, because the food was really good. Service was good, but servers weren't very personable. Perhaps that's not what they're going for anyway. Also, the tables were very close to each other, so at times i felt like I was forced to listen to another couple's conversation. And that can get a little awkward! So that's where the .5 went in terms of my experience. \n\nThat being said, I would definitely come back!"

We had an 8:30 reservation, and arrived about 10 minutes early. We were not seated until 9:10. I assumed the restaurant was overly busy, yet that was not the case. We sat at the bar to wait, and though I did prompt the hostess about our table, she simply apologized (we were not comped with absolutely anything). \n\nOnce we were seated, we ordered the \"sushi sampler\" as an appetizer (around $30). The waiter insisted we get salads before our entrees, but thought the \"sampler\" plus a salad, plus an entree would be too much. Little did we know that by \"sampler\", they meant four tiny pieces of crispy rice topped with raw fish. Though they were delicious (I think the chipotle mayo they use is awesome), you'd better order three or four appetizers if you're really hungry (like the crab leG...yes, singular). After our tiny appetizer, we waited about 25 minutes to get our entrees. Again, it was odd given that the restaurant was at about 30% capacity, on a Friday night. We got the Chilean Seabass with MushrooM (again, singular, in case you're wondering), for around $40, and it was absolutely delicious, flaky, and buttery. We also got the bone-in Rib-Eye steak (I think for around $60), that came with three sauces (two of which the waiter annoyingly insisted were his favorites). The miso soy butter is to die for, and it perfectly complemented both the steak and the fish. We also ordered the truffle mashed potatoes and the bone marrow as side dishes (each for about $20). The mashed potatoes were good, but nothing to rave about. As for the bone marrow (on toast), it was delicious. \n\nWe were celebrating a birthday, and we did get a complimentary flourless chococalate cake with vanilla bean ice cream. Nothing to get too excited over, but it was a nice gesture. \n\nOverall, it is a delicious place and we would go back, yet the service is absolutely lacking. For the pricetag you'll end up paying, you'd expect top-of-the-line service."

I had the \"spoiled child\" vibe from other patrons, but who cares! Let's get our steak on!\n\nThe bread appetizers were interesting and delicious. I am a bread person, so a big plus.\n\nEverything is ordered a la carte, so he got the lamb, and I got an 8 ounce steak and creamed spinach. My dishes were delicious. His lamb was outstanding. I liked the green dipping sauce the meats came in. It definitely added another rich dimension to the meat. Both of us have smallish appetites, so the portions they gave us were perfect. \n\nThere is an attention to detail, which I love about this restaurant. I do feel well taken care of, and extremely comfortable. Definitely a place I would come back to."

I know Jean George is some big time chef..blah blah...but it doesnt need to be that high.  It is not ridiculous like Robuchons for example, but for the price vs quality, I would rather go to BOA or Flemmings and get the same quality of food for a better price.\n\nOverall great place if money grows on trees.

My friend wanted to come here for her birthday dinner. I am always down for a good steakhouse and was a little turned off by the low rating, but decided to go along with it anyway.\n\nWe made reservations for 7pm Saturday night. We walked in and were seated right away. The decor is amazing. I loved the dark lighting, furniture and the whole vibe was just on point. They have the bar located right at the enterence so you can get a drink while waiting for a table. We were seated at a booth and it was cozy and felt very private. They have a wall lined with bottles  of wine running across the restaurant. It is an upscale place, so make sure to dress up.\n\nNow the important part... the food. To start with, I wanted a good glass of wine. They have an extensive wine list. If you are fan of red, I recommend going with with their Malbec, bitter red and went very well with my steak. We started with the calamari and wagyu carpaccio appetizers. The carpaccio was to die for. Four pieces of fatty meat sitting on top of a creamy vinaigrette dressing. Totally mouthwatering and delicious. Probably the best part of our meal. The calamari was alright. Nothing to rave about, but then again suites us right getting seafood at a steakhouse. I would say skip the calamari and go with another appetizer. For my main entree I went with the 8 ounce Filet Mignon; to die for! It was cooked to medium perfection; was very tender. They brought several dipping sauces to the table. I would recommend their bearnaise sauce, however, the steak did taste better on its own. We got the truffle mac n cheese and mushrooms as our sides. Both were phenomenal. We ended the meal with the chocolate lava cake, with a side of the vanilla ice cream... loved it!\n\nOur whole experience was great. Our waiter, Jason was so attentive, kind and very knowledgable about the menu. They answered all our questions and made sure we got everything the way we like it."

For the price point, you are better off going to Del Fresco, N9NE, or Ruth Chris.  The sauces for the protein dishes (NY Strip, Pulled Beef, Bass) were border line disgusting.  Needless to say, I will never go back nor recommend this restaurant to anyone in the future."

I thought the process were quite out of order. I've had better for sell. Over all I'd say they are more for show than content. If you want to have a great high end steak I'd recommend Ruth Chris, LG's, Flemings, or Morton's. If you want to show off how much money you have to or make it rain, Jean Georges is the place. The offered a pork chop for $99 and a special cut steak for $199.  For those prices I'll personally fly anywhere in the country and serve you the best steak you ever had. If you were not born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you have good financial values, you should probably go somewhere else. If your friends are named Justin B, Diddy, or snoop, and your second car just happens to be a Bentley, You'll fit right in.

I have been really interested in try it for a while. I came with my fella, two fellow Yelpers and another friend.\n\nWhile waiting for our party my fella and I sampled some of their cocktails at the bar. I ordered the pineapple mojito and my fella ordered a very fruity looking strawberry champagne drink. I wasn't entirely impressed with these offerings and probably wouldn't try them again.\n\nWe all started with with the watermelon gazpacho. It had some interesting flavors, but I didn't feel it was a great palate starter. The ladies all chose the peach salad with goat cheese to begin and the men got the panzanella salad. I was lucky enough to be able to try them both and they were great. I preferred my peach salad, but they both had great flavors and textures. We all chose the NY Strip for our main course. Since it was a steakhouse we just couldn't resist. I don't typically order a NY Strip when at a steakhouse, but it was extremely tasty, well cooked and seasoned. The tomato compote went excellently with the steak. Flavorful and delicious. Everyone but my fella chose the key lime pie to end the meal, while my fella chose chocolate cake. The key lime pie was extremely tart and delicious. The addition of pop rocks to the top was incredibly interesting. Tasty at first, but got tiring as you continue eating it. The molten chocolate cake was pretty good, but absolutely typical and not extremely exciting. \n\nOverall, I was extremely happy with the conclusion to Restaurant Week 2011. My entire party was incredibly full and happy from our night out."

We checked in at 8pm and they were able to secure us a 9:30 reservation on a Saturday evening. We walked in and were greeted by name and immediate shown to our seats. Dimly lit dining area. Intimate ambience. So far so good. \n\nOur waitstaff was super attentive from then on. They recommended excellent choices and our glasses were never empty and they kept asking if we needed anything every 10 min or so. \n\nWe ordered the wagyu carpaccio to start, 2 filet mignons medium rare, bone marrow, mushroom side and truffle Mac and cheese. Well, let me just say... I almost cried. Their carpaccio was easily one of the BEST things I've ever eaten. Perfectly rare with a truffle crunch in the middle and truffle shavings on top. I'd order that every day for the rest of my life. \n\nOur main courses arrived soon after. The bone marrow and toast. Ugh. Also amazing. With the success of the earlier two dishes, my mouth was watering as I cut into my filet. The char seemed a little too dark, but I trusted they knew what they were doing. I cut into in knowing already that it wasn't medium rare because of how sturdy the meat was..and it was gray. No pink. I asked my husband if his was the same, but his was perfect. Ahhh killjoy. Now, I had already scooped truffle Mac and mushrooms onto my plate to enjoy together, so I was really hesitant about saying anything, but my husband insisted and motioned for our server. I asked him if it was cooked right and he agreed it looked more medium/ medium well. Another server came by and confirmed. I felt so bad about asking for a new piece but our waiter was completely understanding and said, \"no this should be perfect for you.\" He literally came back with a new steak 5 minutes later and it was everything I expected. Perfectly juicy and perfectly cooked. The manager checked in and apologized and I appreciated it.\n\nSigh...I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for that meat issue, and would have let it go if it was for a side dish. But they specialize in Steak. And you can only have that first bite once. They made up for it with the complimentary dessert and excellent service and then lost a star again with the pushy photographers who were a little aggressive about a $200 photo package while we were eating dessert. I expected that they would do it on the way out, not table side. That just kind of cheapened the experience and made it feel more cruise ship. But you could tell they were outside vendors because they didn't have the same delicacy and finesse as the restaurant staff.\n\nOverall, I would still highly recommend Jean George's to anyone looking for a great date night with excellent food."

The dishes are priced on the higher end, but this is not your typical steakhouse! I was told the menu features the highest quality meats and seafood, complimented by a wide array of side dishes and homemade sauces!\n\nAward winning chef Jean Georges Vongeritchen has challenged himself to creating special masterpieces!

Dining at its finest!\n\nI started with the Dungeness Crab Cake with ruby red grapefruit and avocado! This starter was to die for!!\n\nFor my main entree, I ordered the 12 oz. New York Steak,  with chef's house prepared sauces! Oh my gawd, what an experience! This is\nnot your typical steak experience! No wonder this establishment was rated 5-stars!\n\nTo compliment the steak I ordered the \nCarmelized Brussel sprouts made with soy-sherry brown butter and pear! Wow, is all I can say!\n\nFor dessert, I left it to our server/bartender Darren to order for me, and I was not disappointed!  He ordered the warm Valrhona chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream!!!

It's a good thing we're at the Aria because even if you have to wait to be seated, this is a beautiful hotel! Special props to Drarren, our server/bartender!!! I look forward to my next experience here!!! This experience rates a 5-star review in my book, to go with the 5-star dishes and 5-star service by Darren!

This was a MAJOR disappointment.  A party of 3; two of us started with cocktails.  Apple Martini tasted like a Virgin Martini.  Had to send it back for Vodka.  Espresso Martini tasted like it was made with burnt coffee.  \n\nAppetizers:  Lobster Bisque - the WORST I have ever tasted.  Campbell's Soup would have been more welcome.  (so would Safeway brand).  Sent it back & got the Foi Gras with Apple Jalapeno Jelly.  Was more like Jalapeno Jalapeno Jelly.  Could not taste any fruit.  Nothing fruity or acidic to cut the richness of the fat that is inherent with Foi Gras.  Simple balsamic Vinegar would have made this far more enjoyable.  At $32.00 for an appetizer it was quite displeasing.  Other appetizers at the table were a Wedge Salad; which came with only a tiny drizzle of Blue Cheese dressing.  It took several requests to get more.  A beet salad was OK, but nothing exciting.\n\nEntree's - Two New York Strips and one of the evening's specials, a 16 oz Bon-in Fillet.  One Strip was ordered Med-Well, came to the table Med-Rare.  The other was cooked properly (Med) but full of Gristle.  The Fillet was the only saving grace of the evening.  Cooked Rare as ordered and cut like butter.  Truly delicious.  All came with the House Verde Sauce on the side (Jalapeno based) which did not compliment the flavor of the meat.  We ordered B\u00e9arnaise on the side, which went much better.  \n\nFor sides, we ordered the Black Truffle Fritters which were listed as being made with a cheese ( I don't recall the exact variety).  They were a house specialty, or so we were told.  Once again, all we could taste was Jalapeno.  I could have sworn that there was even a hint of Jalapeno in the Asparagus.\n\nAfter the main course, we had enough of the very pricy and mostly palate displeasing offerings.  For desert, we went down to the Casino level for delicious offerings at Jean Philippe Patisserie.  \n\nMy advice is to stay far away from here.  If you want a good steak, there are plenty of fantastic options available in Vegas, Including Jean-Georges good offering - the Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio.  His named offering is simply awful! \n\nAs I said, a BIG disappointment."

Especially when it has  GROUND walnuts that were not visible nor tasted by anyone in the group! No wonder our friend had a near anaphylactic reaction! Luckily her allergy is not extremely severe or there would be a major problem going on. She did not want a commotion to be made, so I discretely went to the hostess to ask what is in the bread - since all servers were no where to be found. She informed me that it was walnuts and that someone should have told us. Since we were dressed up my friend did not have her EpiPen on her so I asked where the nearest medical station was to get some Benadryl (everyone in our group is in the medical profession so we felt comfortable not calling an ambulance). She got hasty with me and said \"Probably the CVS down the street\" - HELLO! You have a medical situation going on - I'm fairly certain the Aria has a medic or at least your restaurant has access to some Benadryl! I checked back in with my group before going on a mile long adventure and my friend told me she would be OK as long as we were all mindful of her situation. The manager never came out to see how she was doing, no one checked in on us until the end when the server said \"Probably should have told you about the nuts, huh?\" That's it. \n\nThe service was majorly lacking. We felt that because we are quite young (early twenties) we were of last priority, apparently our money was not as good as the older couples in the restaurant. At every high end restaurant we have ever been to (and many day-to-day 'regular' restaurants) allergies are of high concern and we have been asked by nearly every server prior to the beginning of the meal. My friend is very aware of her allergy and waits until her husband tries breads or other high concern foods before she does. It passed all of our \"sniff tests\" because it was hidden with other flavors and was ground. Not excusable. Where in the world was management - clearly the server knew that he didn't say anything about the nuts and the hostess knew we weren't told of it. My friend was not comped even in the slightest. Unheard of.\n\nThe rest of the meal was uneventful, food was great. We did the prix fixe meal and was quite good. We were all happy with the rest of our food, despite our general feeling about the restaurant itself."

The big bone in it and sauce tray on side will try to convince you its better.\n\nAmbiance: 4/5\n\nPrice: 2/5  No one should have to pay $12 for a small portion of mash potatoes. \n\nAdvice: Unless your wallet is endless, try somewhere else. And if your wallet is endless, try somewhere else bc Im sure for that price theres much better out there."

My husband called to let them know and they were very accomodating. \n\nWe arrived and were seated right away. Our first waiter came out with the menus and the wine/cocktail list. I started out with a twist on a lemon drop and husband started out with a glass of scotch. \n\nThey brought out a selection of bread but I only really tried the pretzel bread because it my absolute favorite. It was delicious and nice and soft.\n\nWe decided to go with two appetizers, the tuna tartare and the crab crostini. The crab crostini was to die for. Two crostinis loaded with dungeness crab mixture with a light dill flavor. The tuna tartare was a classic take and was very good. \n\nFor the main entree we ordered the tomahawk chop which was a waygu/kobe beef hybrid. We also ordered the fritters, the mashed potatoes and the bone marrow and toast. \n\nThe fritters were so good. They were perfectly fried, and nice and creamy in the middle with a spicy goodness from the jalapeano and cheese combo.\n\nThe bone marrow was really good! I had always wanted to try it and I liked it although on one of them, I couldnt get the marrow out, so that was a little disappointing. \n\nThe mashed potatoes were nice and creamy with a good flavor. But had a little bit of a sticky texture. \n\nNow to the main reason JG's is getting four-stars instead of five. The tomahawk chop. This steak was 26 oz for $95 bucks. Hubby and I decided to share it. \nAs soon as it came out I was wishing we had choosen something else. First of all, a lot of the 26 oz came from the huge bone. Ok, I can get over that. The waitress described the cut as very flavorful because it is marbled with fat. I didn't get that. I got huge pieces of fat on the end and the meat didnt seem too marbled. It was good but it was not great for $100. I was glad they served it with sauces cause honestly it was not overly flavorful. The people at the table next to us had the porterhouse and the filet and I was jealous. \n\nMy husband has another glass of scotch and I had a glass of shiraz. \n\nThe atmosphere was great and modern but the music was a little too loud. There was a photographer walking around and he took some really good pictures of us. I was kicking myself for not getting one this morning but I never asked how much they were cause he came back during a bad time during our meal. \n\nOverall our meal was really good, the atmosphere was nice and romantic, the cocktails were good and the service was excellent. \n\nI would like to come back again and try a few more things on the menu but it will have to be after we have tried some of the other steakhouses in Vegas."

We are all good spenders and so this figured about as good as any place on the strip.\nWhat was truly the greatest experience of our meal was we were seated in the chefs table room. This private room was awesome and perfect for a buncha guys to let loose. And what helped that even more was the waiters. One of the servers was a rapper who gave us a great impromptu display of his abilities and guided us through the menu. The other was a guy with a great sense of humor who would make quips as he left the room. I'd come back here just for that kind of awesome service.\nThe steaks were good. We all got filet mignon or ribeyes. Cooked really well and had a great flavor. It took the addition of some amazing sauces that were included to really kick it up to an interesting taste profile. The sides of truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus were equally as good. It was all really good - not exceptional though as other steakhouses in Vegas have been for me. The desert of the molten volcano cake (which was supposed to be a chef Georges original creation) was well prepared and an excellent cap to a good meal.\nAnywhere in Vegas that employees servers of this degree deserves recognition. It makes the experience worthwhile and I'd go back to try some more there just to support them. It works as a steakhouse and serves you plenty of food for a reasonable strip price. 7 guys made it out for under $700 which was amazing considering we all ordered drinks, 7 steaks, 3 desserts, and 7 sides."

We started with tempura fried calamari which came with Sriracha foam (wow what an invention!). We completely devoured the two plates of this appetizer! \nI ordered the short rib, one friend ordered the steak and two others the burger. I didn't get a taste of the burgers but oh man do I regret not getting the steak, honestly the best steak I have had... I'm not exaggerating. The flavors, the tenderness everything was on point. Now mind you the short rib wasn't bad at all, the meat was tender and tore of the bone with a sweet cranberry sauce. \nNow the service was.... let's just say this. Our glass of waters never emptied past the halfway point, EVERYTIME it got close to...the magical waitstaff immediately re-filled it. Now that's attention to service. Our server was sweet and even provided a free birthday dessert to my friend when we noted that we were celebrating. \nDefinitely a place to check out. You are paying for quality here."

It would have been nice if we were told about this when we made our reservation 6 weeks ago or even when we confirmed.. Surprise Surprise!  The portions were very small which may be expected since there were 5 courses.. At $175 per person I would expect some wine pairing.. Sea Bass was very much over salted.. I did enjoy the lamb which I chose over the tenderloin.. But I had my heart set on a real steak... not lamb or tenderloin.. I would have traded all those little portions for a fat juicy steak... While eating I kept closing my eyes wishing I was at a Morton's.. Do your customers a favor and tell them about the fixed menu in advance..

Super classy decor which is fitting with the Aria look. Our server Ramon was warm and accommodating as he explained the dishes to us.\n\nFor apps, we ordered Wagyu Carpaccio and\nTomato Salad with Hearts of Palm and Coconut. The Tomato Salad was just alright, but the Wagyu Carpaccio was outstanding. Melt in your mouth texture. The truffle combined with the sauce just completed the entire flavor experience. Highly recommend!\n\nNext up we got 12 oz NY Strip and the Soy Glazed Shortrib with Granny Apple & Jalape\u00f1o. \n\nFor the NY strip, we were provided five steak sauces to enhance the flavor of the meat. Gave them all a try and each had its unique taste! My fave was the soy miso butter sauce. Steak was perfectly cooked to medium - one of the best I've ever had!\n\nNow for the short rib - it was absolutely amazing as well. It sucks that it got a bit cold as I spent too long devouring each bite, but regardless it was great. Super tender (slow roasted forever it seems) and it came with an apple salad that was quite refreshing and nicely balanced the spices in the dish. No wonder this dish won some award recently (Dish For Fall - Soy Glazed Short Rib, 2016 Dining Awards (2016) - Vegas Seven).\n\nFor dessert we got the molten lava cake (which was apparently invented by Jean-Georges). The cake was okay but the ice cream was bomb. \n\nOverall it was worth every dollar given the variety of courses we tried and the quality of food and service. I would definitely come back and look forward to trying other Jean-Georges restaurants in different cities! Thanks to Ramon and team for making our dinner one to remember."

We didn't mind and returned about 5 minutes beforehand where the three hostesses just smiled and looked at us and went on talking to themselves.  We finally had to interrupt them and ask when we would be seated as it was past our reservation time.  Surprisingly, the hostess said \"oh, why didn't you check in...we were wondering to ourselves why you were standing there and why hadn't we checked in\". I kindly reminded her that we had checked in 20 minutes before...we received some lame excuse about the system being reset.  Neither she nor the other 2 hostesses could be bothered enough to ask whether we needed anything and let us stand there for almost 10 minutes.\n\nOur experience did improve a bit after being seated in a fairly empty restaurant and our server was very friendly, although the time between courses was fairly long.\n\nI will say my husband's short rib dish was excellent and did not disappoint.  My sea bass, while cooked well, was drowning in the soy-yuzu glaze and could have been any piece of fish at that point.\n\nAnd to top off the evening, we were surprised to have a photographer ask us if we would like a photograph taken in the midst of dinner - as though we were at a cheesy attraction instead of a fine dining restaurant."

As for the food, the way their rice cracker crusted tuna was prepared was perfect!  I could taste the citrus without it overpowering the rest of the seasonings.  Dinner was served with a small plate of a variety of breads.  Each piece was a taste all on its own.  I found their chilean sea bass to be average, however.  The dish was supposed to be prepared with miso-yuzu glaze and it did taste like it but seemed a bit dry.  I've had better miso-yuzu glazed fish from Trader Joe's. So, paying $39 for it as opposed to a bigger, much tastier $8 prepared dinner from TJ's made the dining experience under par.  I remember having a couple of drinks but they must not have been that memorable because I can't even recall which ones I had."

The salmon also good, but not spectacular. Very disappointed in the apple pie, but I have yet to find a great apple pie in Vegas. Everyone thinks that apple pie needs to be reinvented--IT DOES NOT.  That's why the saying goes, \"As American as apple pie.\"  It's an ICON. Jean Georges made the same mistake everyone makes, lots of crust and almost no apples, and the apple filling itself  was subpar. If you're one of those who removes the crust and eats only the apples, you'll be done in three bites. We need to have a pie cook off every year in Vegas, focusing on a different pie each year.  Would someone please get this going!?"

My husband's lychee bellini ($14) looked pretty but I didn't try it.  He enjoyed it.\n\nBy the way, the coasters are apparently supposed to depict a cow.  I had to stare at it a while to see it.  Look at my pics, imagine some eyes, and you'll see it.  The design is all over the restaurant.  At first I thought it was supposed to depict a fork on LSD.\n\nWe decided to order the steak tartare ($20), which interestingly enough comes with basil (not parsley), quail egg, and lime juice.  Extremely yummy! It comes with the best french fries ever! \n\nWe also got the truffle fritters ($12) and, OMG, these were the best!  Just the right about of truffle, nice and cheesy inside.  So good.  And the right portion size at 8 fritters.\n\nEven though we were only ordering appetizers and drinks, the bartender brought by bread.  We got pretzel bread and cherry pecan.  The bread was really, really good.  I love pretzel bread and he gave us three pieces.  I almost ate too much, which would have ruined me for the next two restaurants in the foodie crawl so I limited myself to one piece.\n\nThe bartender was super friendly - I think he was just feeling us out in the beginning.  He started chatting us up and we got some info from him on why so many restaurants were closed in Aria that night (American Fish, Bar Masa, Sirio, Sage) with NFR and the marathon in town.  He said that Aria is an occupancy based property and they were only at 30% occupancy so when that happens some of the restaurants close to keep costs down.  People don't really walk in off the street.  Bummer.\n\nTowards the end of the meal, some guy who was getting comped sat down next to us and was being a real prick.  So that probably explains why the bartender was standoffish at the beginning.  This was my favorite restaurant of the foodie crawl.  A nice surprise!"

The sauces that accompany the steak are delicious, the soy miso butter sauce is one of the best sauces I have ever had. Sitting at the bar for dinner is a must, as Darren, Mike, and Gary are some of the best bartenders in Vegas! All the drinks on the menu are delicious, but if you don't see something you like or want to try something new they would be glad to give you a recommendation or make you something special. I know that Darren has won many mixology competitions and is a master mixologist! Overall I highly recommend anyone in Vegas going to eat at Jean Georges steakhouse- it will not disappoint."

I have to say, and I think I speak for the rest of the party I was with, this place was awesome. \n\nThe restaurant was not decorated in the normal steakhouse design. They have cool images of a cow's nose running throughout the place. It was cool and dark with a modern edge. \n\nThe service started out stellar and continued that way. We had two servers for our table of two. They were very knowledgeable and quick to respond to our needs. They provided great recommendations for food. The sommelier was good. I felt she got a good feel for what we were looking for and provided a good bottle. \n\nWe started out with drinks and I heard no complaints. I had the cucumber-gin drink. A little sweet, but still really good. \n\nWe got 3 starters to share; grilled foie gras, rice cracker tuna and a mozzarella dish. \n\nThe foie gras was good. I can see why people like it. butter and rich with a smokey flavor, thanks to the grill. \n\nThe mozzarella dish was nice and simple. The cheese was amazing. It was a Caprese salad with out being one. \n\nThe tuna was a hit. Crispy outside and perfectly rare in the middle. My wife is not a huge seafood fan and really enjoyed it. The sriracha mayo with it was perfect. They serve jalapeno crackers with the bread dish. We all tried it with the tuna and it was better than what it was served with. We told the waiter and he said he had been telling the chef the same thing. \n\nI had the lamb chops. Perfectly cooked medium rare and seasoned well. The green peppery sauce was a great accompaniment. \n\nMy wife and her friend split the chicken dish. The really liked it and I got a taste. It was pretty damn good for a simple chicken dish. \n\nOur other friend got a fish plate, I think it was the sea bass. I shared my lamb, which was a hard thing to do, for some fish. Not as good as the lamb, but good. \n\nWe also had the broccoli rapini and the mashed blue cheese potatoes. I can't speak for everyone on the rapini, but I like it. The potatoes on the other hand, we fought over who got to lick the cast iron dish it can in! They were, to me, the best thing on the table. \n\nWhat a great place for any occasion."

My friend had ordered the short ribs which was really good a little sweet but the meet came right off. My waitress was super nice and was kind to offer some specials and her opinions on what I would like. As it was a late birthday celebration she in the end brought a molten chocolate cake with French vanilla ice cream and let me tell you the cake was cooked to perfection the chocolate oozed out.

I find it important to note that Aria, the hotel the restaurant is in, just opened its doors on Wed 12/16 and from what I was told Fri 12/18 was the first night the restaurant was open to the public. The price point was higher; we spent around $100 per person, with drinks appetizers and salads, main courses and sides (this is excluding the 2 bottles of wine). The food was excellent and what we would expect from this type of restaurant, and though the flow of the meal was a bit on the slow side, as I said they had just opened so we expected there to be kinks for them to work out. The wait staff was nothing but friendly and helpful, other than the sommelier which left some to be desired. He didn't really know the wines, and just didn't seem like he wanted to be there given his comments. I think the only thing that was a standout negative was the napkins. I think because they are new, they have a lot of lint coming off of them, so every time someone would get up to use the restroom and the wait staff would fix the napkins, the lint would fly in the air and get in the glasses. As I said, they were new so, though it was a bit unappetizing, it was understandable. We told the hostess about it as we were leaving and they seemed aware by that point. Now, I usually don't write this much for reviews, but given the one review shown for this place (which I find did not at all give it justice), I wanted to give a little more info. Overall, great place and as Vegas locals, we will go again."

Chunkier than most, lightly layered / mixed with avocado with soy ginger dressing. A crisp rice cracker a good textural foil.   The tempura calamari, light and crisp with very little residual oil.  Pairs well with it's sweet chili sauce.\n\nTo the steaks, USDA Prime, extremely well trimmed, beautifully seared on a hardwood burring grill, even coking to exact temperature.  \n\nThe Australian wagyu filet mignon, buttery with a cloying fatty finish.  Around A3 quality.  Tender but lacks any wow factor.  The star of the menu is the Angus 300 (it is not aged for 300 days but the name of the steak.).   According to the restaurant, the steak is raised in elevations in excess of 3000 feet and fed slowly for 300 days, finished for the last 100 without any hormones or antibiotics.  The steak is wet aged 14 days and finished with a 28 day dry age.  Very good, pronounced dry age flavor, nutty and buttery with a good umame punch.\n\nStandard USDA Prime cuts are right on par.  Excellent, porterhouse and rib eye.  Both tender with good beef flavor. \n\nFor sides, props to the bone marrow with lemon remolata.  Rich and unctuous.  Toss the toast, scoop the marrow on the steak, add the granita and enjoy!  A beautiful pairing that brightens the steak and makes it even more wine friendly.  The black truffle and cheese decedent.  Aromatic, covered with shaved black truffles.  Works very well with the Angus 300 further accentuating its umame goodness.\n\nFinally, for non beef eaters, the roasted Chilean Sea Bass with a miso yuzu glaze and a side of roasted maitake mushrooms good eats.  Think miso butter fish with a side of great mushrooms, umame on umame.  \n\nKeep in mind, portions are smaller when compared to other top steakhouses.\n\nService remains steakhouse proper and friendly.  The wine list remains excellent.  High Vegas resort pricing.\n\n*****scratches head***** No Japanese beef?"

NY Strip Wagyu Kobe Beef - It MELTED in my mouth. One of the best meat I've ever eaten. We ordered 4 oz which costed $19 per oz. It was worth it. The flavor in meat was not overpowering the texture of the Wagyu beef.\n5. Filet Mignon Wagyu Kobe Beef- THIS IS AN ORGASM! The three of us sample this delicacy, and we all agreed that this was the BEST FOOD ORGASM ever. The meat melted in your mouth. It was so juicy, tender, and you name it all. It was ORGASMIC\n6.

We were seated next to a few ladies, one of which was talking very loudly of how she had gone on a date with an ex-football player of the Cleveland Browns?  She was talking about how he wasn't the smartest/sharpest tool in the box.\nSo annoying.  Unnecessary and annoying.\nLike what do I write here?\nShould I write about how salty the steaks were?  SALTY.  We were flabbergasted but tried to eat it as much as we could. \nUgh.\n40-50 dollars a steak which was inedible due to the enormous amount of salt.\nMy fiances steak was very rare when she had asked for medium.\nThe thing that was most upsetting was when we decided to complain to our server she said she would talk to the chef and we figured something might have been done.  Free desert, no charge for the rare steak,etc., but absolutely nothing was done.\nShe came back to the table, asked if we would like dessert as if nothing was wrong.  We were clearly upset and said no and just asked for the check which she gave at that time.\n\nI opened the check and saw that nothing was done and that..  ..The CHECK was as is.\n\nShaking head. I asked to speak to the manager, and thankfully, she took out the filet mignon.  We were just upset, because our server could have spoken to the manager to alleviate the situation, but we had to take the matter into our own hands. \n\nOverall, The STEAKS were very salty.  They might as well pack the steak in salt and serve it to you.\nThe STEAKS were cooked poorly.  Red rare for a medium steak.\nThe server could have made us less mad had she done something about the CHECK before bringing it back to the table.\nWe'll never be back and we don't recommend you waste your money here.

The kobe is to die for, but can put a major dent in the wallet. I suggest splitting a few ounces amongst the table for the experience alone, you can cut it with a spoon and it melts in your mouth. The accompanying sauces with the steaks are ridiculous. Sure a steak should speak for itself (and they certainly do here), but you are missing out if you haven't tried the soy-rice wine sauce. All in all, the food here exemplifies culinary mastery in terms of creativity, balance, depth, and quality choices of ingredients. From the oysters, to the hamachi, to the salads, to the steaks, to the dessert, you will not be let down. They also have a pretty impressive wine list. Eating here makes Mastros, Mortons, the Palm, and all your tired cookiecutter steakhouses look like a big waste of time, money and calories.\nHowever, if you are looking for a big waste of time, money and chicks who have had more than their fair share of calories, then go downstairs to ARIA's lackluster nightclub Haze."

It is a good size but when my aunt couldn't finish hers and offered It to me I didn't turn it down. ( I usually decline offers like that but it would have been a sin to say , \"no\". ) The waiters came by and dropped off the sauces. They both said the Miso was their favorite I tried it but I'm sticking with the Bernaise for my personal choice.\n\n I also had a side of lobster mashed potatoes. I've got to say they are not the best that I've had. They were runny and just too salty. It was the color of a drab pumpkin. There were only a couple of pieces on the top and that was it. I was expecting chunks of lobster mixed into regular mashed potatoes or even better some garlic mash. It was hard to eat it all. \n\nWe finished dinner with the cheesecake and glazed cherries. I'm not a fan of cheesecake so I saved that for my husband and ate the glazed cherries. They were stuffed in the thin sugar cookie tube with whipped cream. It may have been small but it was delicious!"

Don't misunderstand me as being cheap-I will certainly pay good money for a fabulous meal, but that is exactly what I want-\"fabulosity\" (Thanks, Kimora Lee Simmons).\n\nI started off with a classic cesear, but it was nothing spectatular. My father ordered shrimp cocktail and the prawns were tasty, but again, nothing that made me jump off the seat. I had the lamb chops as my entree. Super disappointed. The lamb was not butchered well-it was frenched but, a lot of fat remained. In fact that fat to meat ratio was 2:1.

I'm not big on that stuff so skipped it, but the tuna tartare was tasty.\n\nOn to the meal - I ordered the 10oz dry aged strip, medium rare. It wasn't even close to that, it was cooked unevenly from medium to medium well, which is a crime. I never send food back, but did not hesitate to this time. Second steak has the exact same problem. Not sure how a steak place can screw up a good steak twice, but they did. At that point I ate a few bites because I was hungry.\n\nWhen the waiter asked if I wanted it boxed up, I told him to take that back to the cook and tell him to learn what medium rare feels like to the touch before he ruins any more.\n\nCoworker had the same steak, also a little over cooked. Said it was one of the more flavorless and tough steaks he's ever had. Same opinion from me. The pieces I did eat, had no flavor at all.\n\nShould have stuck to something bone in.\n\nNo apologies from any manager or offer to make it right. Unheard of for a restaurant in this price bracket."

We were pleased with our decision. \n\nThat afternoon, we glanced at the video menu in the hallway area and decided to make reservations there the same day.  No problem, got right in. \n\nSeated immediately, and our server arrived for drink orders.  She was great--wish I knew her name. They didn't offer an \"early evening menu\" but I had seen it on the video menu screen earlier in the day.  I opted for that at $69.  It included a starter salad (orig $16,)  filet mignon (orig $58) and a warm chocolate cake (orig $15.)  So the total savings was about $20.  My husband had the Porterhouse Ribeye, and we added the truffle mac and cheese.  Everything was delicious.  The mac and cheese was good, but nothing to scream about. \n\nService was impeccable.

I didn't insist on new food as that really isn't my way. He thanked me and went off. He didn't return and the bill was for the entire meal. This is clearly one of the options open to him.

The experience should be one that wows me at their price point, but sadly Jean Georges didn't wow.  First up was a sushi sampler.  Extremely small, tasty morsels of three types of fish on a deep fried rice cake with a spicy mayo.  Not bad, fish slices could have been more generous, but not wow.  Some soy sauce with that maybe?  The main was the Australian NY Steak.  It comes with four sauces; a house made habanero butter sauce, a soy miso sauce, a flat bernaise sauce and some ketchupy kinda thing.  Can you tell how I felt about the last two sauces?  There was also a bone marrow shaped container of a salsa verde that was very nice.  Did I really need five sauces with the steak?  Nothing offensive about it, just sometimes less is more maybe?  The mashed potatoes were quite buttery, very nice.  First cocktail came with a dirty glass, but that was immediately remedied when pointed out.  The service was fine.  The decor felt very New York.  \n\nSo there it is, my meh dining experience at the very pricey Jean Georges Steakhouse."

We had a party of 8 without reservations, and as with all high end places, had to go through the rigmarole of them checking to see if they could fit us in, even though once we were sat there were empty seats everywhere. It's on the very high end price-wise, so I'm sure this drives away a lot of folks.\n\nThe atmosphere inside is very chill - very low lighting, dark woods, and some cool art features on the walls. There is an impressive wall of wine at the back of the restaurant. So after a short wait, we were seated and a host of different servers started attending to us. For their drink menu, they use a custom iPad app to allow you to scroll through the various drink menus and wine list. Cool concept, but since you can't view everything at once like you would normally on a menu, you have to use a filter/search function which was not built well. A regular menu would probably save a lot of time. With that said, we eventually found a couple bottles to our liking.\n \nTheir specialty is steak, and this is what everyone in our party ordered. They have some really over-the-top options as you would expect. The special of the night was a wagyu steak at $209 - no one touched this one. On the menu itself, the most expensive was the porterhouse at $109. I ended up going with the 16 oz dry aged ribeye at $66. One of the guys had the standard 18 oz ribeye at $62 which I sampled for comparison. If I ever go again, I'll opt for this one instead of the dry aged. Though the dry aged is bit more tender from the grass-fed beef and contained less marbling, it just wasn't as juicy and flavorful as the standard one from what I tasted. Sides were also very good. I like frites with my steak, and theirs were great. \n\nThey did brutalize one of the guy's steaks. He had ordered it mid-rare and it was quite well done. That seemed very unusual - we assumed the server grabbed someone else's plate as everyone else's were spot on with the temperature.\nWhat put the meal over the top in my opinion was the accompaniment of sauces. Each steak comes with a salsa verde sauce which was phenomenal. Then our server also brought out all of the other 4 sauces you can order from the menu. This is the way to go - try them all - very unique and adds some great flavoring to the steak."

We were a group of five and shared the porterhouse, the rib eye, the chicken, black truffle Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and Brussels sprouts. The rib eye was delicious with just the right amount of fat. The porterhouse was somewhat chewy on the new York strip side. Interestingly, the chicken was super delicious with a crispy outside and a tender inside. The chicken came with this spicy buttery sauce that was just perfect. They serve their meats with a variety of sauces but the chimichurri was my fav. The sides were small but good. My fav was the truffle Mac and cheese. For all of us, it was $350 I believe with two cocktails. Service was pretty slow though."

(one star at best) We had an 8PM dinner and arrived to a pretty full house - several tables of large groups around.  It took forever for our waitress to come to the table to introduce herself and her assistant.  She was extremely short with any questions we asked and even the sommelier was, well, bitchy.  We got drinks we didn't order, were presented with sides we did not order and then had to pay for those errors.  Once the house started to clear, the service remained the same ... BAD!  Oh and we saw a table of four get up and walk out because they had waited so long - their plates had not even cleared.. \n\nService aside, the food was outstanding!  Best chicken I've had in a long time, the sides were solid classics and the desserts to die for.  We had some salted caramel ice cream with popcorn that sounded strange but was positively mind blowing.  I would certainly go back for the food in hopes that they will pull the service up."

You walk into a dimly lit dining area that reminds me of a cave. There are interesting decorations around but I suppose the lighting can be described as intimate. They have a huge wall of wine near the bar area that is pretty impressive. There is ample seating and it doesn't feel like you are crammed together. \n\nThe food was alright but nothing overly spectacular. There were some interesting flavors in what we ordered. My boyfriend and I both ordered the same thing but had different experiences. \n\nWe had the JG Cheeseburger - Truffle mayonnaise, Brie cheese, Yuzu Pickles and Truffle fries.  We both ordered the burgers Medium but mine came medium rare and the other was medium well. So the texture of the burger was a bit off for both of us.  The truffle mayonnaise was interesting but kinda lost its flavor after a few seconds. The Brie was very nice on my burger but then again I LOVE Brie.  The Yuzu pickles kinda had a sharp flavor to them so I felt like it took away from the flavor of the meat and cheese so I ate them on the side. Now if any of you have read my other posts then you would know that I'm a fry snob and I'll say that I didn't eat many of my truffle fries. The fries were crispy which was nice but the truffle was just kinda garnished over the fries and was a bit hard to eat. \n\nWe also ordered a side of the Black Truffle Mac & Cheese. This was tasty with shaved black truffle on the top and bread crumbs. I think this was the best part of the meal to be honest but still lacked a certain something. \nThe burgers are $26 bucks a piece and the Black Truffle Mac & Cheese is $18 bucks. \n\nOver all, it wasn't bad but I wasn't really in a WOW stage by the time I left. I might go back but I don't have a burning desire to do so. Reservations are recommended if you do go and I would suggest going around 6:30 when it isn't quite in the dinner rush yet."

If you're looking for some good eats at the Aria and want to venture off in some of the fine dining they have to offer, Jean Georges is definitely one of those places that delivers.\n\nThe Place -\nJean Georges is located inside of the Aria Casino on the Promenade Level (2nd Level) across from The Buffet in this, sort of, horseshoe next to a few of the other restaurants. While Yelp describes the place as needing \"dressy\" attire, you can definitely enter the place with a \"business casual\" type of a dress code. If you enter the place with a t-shirt or shorts, you will definitely feel out of place. The restaurant itself is fairly dark and intimate, which is expected with any type of fine dining experience and the furniture and decor is very modern. The bar is a fairly decent size; however, the seats at the bar are spread out spaciously so that you don't feel like you're sitting in someone else's lap when you're enjoying your beverage or eating your meal. At the bar, you're treated with two flat panel TVs mounted back to back to take care of both sides of the countertop. The restaurant itself has a fairly big footprint and can definitely accommodate for any party size. Very cool place, Jean Georges!\n*****5/5 Stars*****\n\nThe Service -\nI was in town for a conference and the last session ended at 5:15pm. Jean Georges's only service is during dinner with doors opening at 5:00pm. Immediately, after my last session, I went straight to Jean Georges in hopes of being able to just sit at the bar as a walk-in. I checked out their digital menu that is mounted on the wall right outside of the restaurant and after a few brief minutes, I approached the door where I was greeted by several hostesses. I asked if Jean Georges is reservation only or if I could walk-in to the bar and they politely let me know that the bar was open seating, offering the full dinner menu, and that I was more than welcome to have a seat. Hostess interaction is really important to me as it's usually the first impression that you get of the restaurant and Jean Georges delivered flawlessly. I sat myself at the bar where I was then promptly greeted by the bartender, Thomas. He asked if I was staying to eat and gave me a menu to glance over. After that, he gave me the drink menu, gave me a few minutes, and took the initiative of getting me a water in the meantime. I came during Game 1 of the World Series and they had the game on the TVs and the bartenders and patrons were participating in general conversation regarding the game and were all really down to earth. The excellent service continued throughout constantly checking up on me making sure that I was ok. The service in a restaurant is just as important as the food they serve and Jean Georges definitely delivered. Thanks, guys!\n*****5/5 Stars*****\n\nThe Food -\nGoodness gracious, where do I begin? As I was looking through the menu attempting to figure out what I wanted, the bartender(not Thomas) came around and gave us popcorn (See Picture) to snack on. Now, some of you probably just snickered at the mention of \"popcorn\" at a fine dining restaurant, but trust me, this is popcorn you DEFINITELY wanna try. The popcorn, in addition to it being buttered, is also dusted with Cayenne Pepper and Rosemary giving it a savory kick to your tastebuds. The taste is absolutely addicting and wouldn't mind if they made it available for the public to buy and have it shipped to their house haha. For my main dish, I ordered the Soy Glazed Short Ribs (See Picture) and the Truffle Mac & Cheese (See Picture). The Truffle Mac & Cheese is nothing special, but delicious nonetheless. It's very creamy and cheesy and the truffle is present throughout each bite. The Soy Glazed Short Ribs were nothing short of amazing. The short ribs were perfectly cooked not needing a knife, only your fork, to cut it. The accompanying apple-jalepeno puree was a sweet and savory accent that matched perfectly with the apple slaw that was served on top of the short ribs, which I could've ate just by itself all day haha. The Soy Glaze on the short ribs was absolutely delicious and is definitely what made these short ribs some of the best I've ever tasted and I've tasted A LOT! Haha. The glaze was sweet, tangy, and did not overpower the rest of the dish. It was well-balanced and I HIGHLY recommend it if you're in the mood for some delicious short ribs! Tres bien, Jean Georges.....tres, tres bien!\n*****5/5 Stars*****\n\nOverall -\nI'm glad I was in vicinity of this restaurant. There are many places to choose from in Vegas when it comes to a steakhouse. In fact, I believe each major casino on The Strip has their own steakhouse so it makes it hard to choose. If you're in the Aria as a visitor or a guest of the hotel, I would HIGHLY recommend checking out Jean Georges! Thank you for the great food, great service, and a memorable experience."

Sometimes simple is better but when the elements taste so harmoniously together, it's hard to complain. Also the turnover time between courses was impressive and on point.

The wedge salad was nicely done with not too much dressing.\n\nSteak and chicken came out soon after salads, Timing was good and we weren't rushed.  Both dishes were prepared perfectly and tasted delicious.  Our server came over several times during the meal to check on things but was not intrusive.\n\nA great dining experience.\n\nThe only odd thing was that during dinner, a light bulb or fixture exploded over our heads and a large (about 6 or 7 inches) metal rod came down from the ceiling and hit my dining companion.  A bit startling and a little disturbing.  The general manager eventually came over to apologize but not much else.  Had it been over about another 2 inches, it would have struck my friend in the head, but instead struck him in the shoulder.  Not sure what was happening there but it was somewhat dangerous.  \n\nOther than the exploding light fixture, the dinner was amazing."

I ordered the lobster and only ate 1/4th if it due to the awful fishy flavor (thank god I didn't eat the rest). The waiter clearly saw the 1/4 eaten $55 lobster as I asked for the bill and didn't feel like it would be appropriate to ask me how everything was. I didn't want to embarrass my gf so I just bit my tongue and let it go. As a consequence of this establishment I sat the next day and night in my room hating life. Keep in mind I'm paying to stay in the room which definitely added insult to injury. Basically I wouldn't recommend this place or anywhere is Vegas for seafood. After all, it is a desert with no sea or ocean in sight.  It's only logical to stay away from the seafood."

We started with two flutes of champagne and a seafood platter that had oysters, clams, lobster, shrimp, and the biggest crab leg I've honestly ever seen. The three sauces that accompanied the seafood platter were all divine. We were served different types of breads with butter, a soft mini pretzel roll, spicy, large fancy cracker, and a chewy raisin type. I just couldn't get enough of these! The different textures were a delight. Then came the expensive bottle of  Riesling which i practically finished myself before the Entree was even ordered. I asked for the label. But, I guess they forgot. I regret this. It was the best Reisling I've ever had. I ordered the smallest portion of filet mignon and a side order of roasted bone marrow. I never would've thought that bone marrow would be that tasty. a woman stopped by the table and took some photos. It was then that I realized, I took too long noshing on bread and guzzling  sumptuous wine. I looked at that picture perfect, untouched filet mignon. I was full when it came time to dive into the magical creation that was the reason for coming. It ended up in a doggie bag. Shameful I know. I never got to try it. The pictures were nice. The prices I'm sure were way out of my economic league. I bet the bill would've been a car payment. But, thanks to my well-to-do friend, who $$$$splurged on me, I got to experience this epicurean adventure.\nWould I return. Doubtful. But, splendid experience."

I totally understand policy and procedures, but they do a very poor job of making their policies known.  There are dress codes at certain places, but you will know that prior to arrival.

The Prime New York strip was bland but very good quality. I had the dry aged bone-in Prime NY strip and it was significantly better than the wet aged strip. Two others had Prime 6oz fillets and they were both very good. 6oz Wagyu fillet was fabulous. So, 4 different steaks all with different flavors. All steaks were cooked to perfection but none of them had what we considered to be a good char. We are all from TX and are all huge fans of fine steaks. In comparison to nicer restaurants in TX (Bohannan's San Antonio & 3 Forks Dallas) it was below par and was priced higher. Probably wouldn't return or recommend to friends who enjoy good steaks. Shrimp Appetizers were good but pork ribs were just average."

We started with a bottle of red...good thing is they have a decent and diverse wine list, hitting all price points.  Even the cheap wines are \"OK\"; the bad thing is most are marked up about 225%.  We ordered 3 appetizers (crab cake, pork belly egg rolls, and bone marrow side dish as an app).  I was bummed to find out they took foie gras off the menu, due to its unpopularity.  On a promising note, the waiter and sommelier were attentive and the waiter did double check to see if there just happened to be any foie gras  \"available\" in the kitchen; sadly there was not.  Appetizers filled the 3 of us, but our entrees included sea bass, tomahawk steak special, and a burrata tomato salad and tuna tartare salad.  Sea bass was the best out of the three.  There seem to be too little salt on the steak, tomatoes, and tuna, but all were still decent but not out of this world or matching the price tag.  We ordered a second bottle to numb the damage just prior to the check.  Ouch it hurts, especially since  I've had better \"expensive\" food.\n\nI walk away with a memory of \"eating there\" sort of a tick mark on a bucket list, but nothing particularly stands out from my dining experience. To add salt to the wound, American Fish looked like a livelier and more tasty place to eat.  I don't know for sure, but just what it seems..."

I got the 5 course Signature Tasting Menu and it was great excellent!!\n\nThe bread basket had a pretzel roll, lavosh, and two pieces of Bon Breads batards.  Nice basket selection.\n\nCoure 1 - Almas Ara Caviar served on a bed of lemon gel\u00e9e with some cr\u00e8me fraiche and a sprig of dill.  The gel\u00e9e filled a hollowed out lemon and the caviar and other things were placed on top of the gel\u00e9e,\n\nCoure 2 - Bacon wrapped shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro.  \n\nCourse 3 - Chilean Sea Bass with a miso foam with Yuzu.  \n\nCourse 4 - 6 ounce Wagyu filet served on a small bed of spinach and with two rounds of parmesan squash.\n\nCourse 5 - Desert was the JG Candy bar.  The candy bar was a mixture of chocolate crunch with caramel peanuts, some candied popcorn, peanut butter, white chocolate, and an oval of whipped cream.\n\nComments:  I was impressed by the flavor profiles developed in each of the dishes.  The mixture of lemon, dill and caviar was unique and very fresh tasting.  The bacon gave the shrimp and amazing taste and the papaya mustard added an additional layer of flavor.  The spiciness of the foam with the sea bass was another wonderful flavor pairing.  The Wagyu beef was so tender it almost fell apart on its own yet it was cooked black and blue as I asked.  Finally the candy bar had so many flavors and textures and it was really a playful finishing course for this grand meal.\n\nI did not get the dipping sauces with my steak, but I didn't request them and I didn't care if I had them or not.  I'm normally a steak purist and like steak as it is without anything but salt.\n\nThe staff was amazing.  I was served by Team 1.  I had prompt, always attentive service without being annoying.  My iced tea glass was not refilled.  When I neared the end of a glass, a server came by with a fresh glass of iced tea and took the old one.  I didn't need to request a refill--it was just done.  The main server always returned after I had a short time with each course to check if everything was satisfactory.  This is amazing service and the team concept worked just the way they planned.\n\nI liked the room a lot.  It's modern, dimly lit but with small spot lights that light each table so you have a super combination of dim lighting but enough light I didn't need the flash when I took my photos.  I also liked the fact that the bar area with its TV was segregated from the dining areas by a sheer curtain that blocked the bar atmosphere which is just fine with me.\n\n** Begin Rant:  Guys, this is not a restaurant to wear t-shirts even if they are for Azuza Pacific U.  Dress up a little, please!  And for two other guys, wearing a ball cap at any restaurant during dinner is NEVER correct.  Show some class.  John Deere no less.  ** End Rant.\n\nJean Georges is a restaurant to which I'll return.  Truly 5 stars!"

My sister, who wasn't planning on coming decided to come with her 4 month old.  We told them we needed 1 more seat.  No problem there.  When they saw my sister walk in with her son, they said they don't allow children under 5.  Not 10 seconds after she says that, as my brother is talking to hostess, a family walks out with 3 kids.  The oldest couldn't have been 6 yet, and the youngest was still an infant.  I walked to the host station and showed her my platinum mLife card and she went and talked to the manager.  He came over, shook my hand, and offered a bottle of wine on the house, and obviously allowed my nephew to join us.  My nephew didn't make a peep all through dinner.  \nOnto the dining experience.   We were seated at one of the large round booths.  Very comfortable and was easy to see and hear everyone.  We got some form of enormous seafood platter as an appetizer for the table.  Alaskan king crab legs, lobster tails, oysters, clams, and prawns.  Everything was delicious!  They server told us about the specials.  One was a Kobe filet for $210.  Wow.  There was a half Kobe half Wagyu bone in rib-eye that they aptly dubbed \"The Tomahawk.\"  Check the pictures, I will upload one.  This thing was big and tasty.  It came with a green sauce on the side that was good, but I prefer my steaks with no sauce.  The server picked out a good bottle of wine, for free remember!  It went great with the steak.  \nFor dessert, my girlfriend and I shared a Cr\u00e8me Brulee.  I have yet to have a bad Cr\u00e8me Brulee....\nWill be going back for sure, but I did take off a star due to how the treated my sister."

It was a special that day at $95. I got the bone marrow side and foie grais appetizer. My lady got 8 or 10 oz filet with black truffle fritter as a side. My buddies got a 28oz porterhouse, and the miso seabass. I forgot what else they ordered. But from what I remember, the miso seabass was overly saucey.\n\nAnyways... My steak came horribly charred on the outside. Every bite was like sinking my teeth into a piece of charcoal. The waiter came by and asked if he could do anything about the steak. All i was thinking was \"what are you gona shave off all the charcoal on the outside?\" I said forget it and just dealt with it. It was all getting comped by Aria anyways. All the sides were good though. The foie had a great apple jalapeno spread on the side. \n\nOverall the food was decent. I liked craftsteak better (plus they serve real kobe). The ambiance was nice.

I think it's because there were so many conventions in town that it was just too busy everywhere and maybe workers were stressed and didn't know how to handle busy times. Who knows. \n\nComing here was such a great ending to our weekend.  The service was phenomenal. We made same day reservations about 4 hours ahead of time. We were greeted kindly when we walked in and also seated right away. I ordered the salmon and it was cooked perfectly. My husband's ribeye was also cooked perfectly.  The shoyu butter sauce was amazing!  Goes great with steak.  I think our server's name was Jum. He made the dinner run smoothly and was extremely friendly and knowledgable about anything we asked. He recommended the truffle Mac and cheese which was also exceptionally delicious!  I would definitely come back again."

They jump up into my top steakhouse tier that now only includes 3 spots.  I went with my personal classic steakhouse choices since this was my first visit:\n\nAppetizer/salad:  None\n\nBread:  Pretzel.  This was a perfect way to start the meal.  I'm happy to see that pretzel bread has become a norm at steakhouses.\n\nEntree:  Australian Wagyu 6 oz Filet Mignon.  This was the hero of the meal and it delivered.  That was the sole factor in propelling Jean Georges in my mind.  I had it cooked medium rare, and the taste was amazing!  Perfectly tender.  They offer an array of sauces that were great, but the steak stands alone (how I prefer it).  I'd love these sauces when I'm eating something that NEEDS sauce, but this steak does not.\n\nSides:  Truffle Mashed Potatoes and Creamed Corn.  Both were excellent choices and would repeat.\n\nThe setting/design of the restaurant caught my eye immediately as well.  I will definitely be back for that Australian filet again!"

The best meal I've ever had was at Jean Georges in NYC, my meal at Prime is in the top 10, and one of my favorite entrees is a good steak (especially dry aged) so I was eager to try this steakhouse. I started with the wedge which was bland. Needed salt and more blue cheese. Then came my \"rare\" dry aged strip steak. The waiter was thoroughly disinterested in us to begin with and did not ask us to cut into our steaks. Although there was a small line of rare meat in the middle, the rest was gray. We could not get our waiter's attention, but another waiter came over and explained that we just don't know what dry aged beef is supposed to look like. Oh really? My mild mannered husband had reached his limit and asked for the manager. She did bring us 2 new steaks. Same thing. The middle had zero flavor. And the outside was not charred, but more like a charcoal briquette - bitter and burned. Their steaks are accompanied by 4 disgusting sauces. Our friend's sea bass was dry. We were not charged for the steaks, but what a horrible experience. I left hungry."

I've had steak plenty of times in Vegas, on and off the strip and every restaurant I've been to (so far) has been amazing.  Well, until I came to Jean George.  \n\nPeople on yelp are NOT joking or being rude saying that the customer service is terrible, because it is.  I was in a party of 8, one big table in the corner with a great view, and we had 2 servers. You would think with TWO servers we would be well taken cared of. Totally no the case.  Our two servers were never at our table.  IT took us almost 30 minutes to order, and when we finally could wave someone down, they were rude about it.  We noticed too, that when we said no to wine, we got a \"uh ok..\" and did we see our waitERS after that? nope.  Not until we had to pay.  Our waiters gave us this \"you have to inconvenience me AGAIN\" attitutde? it made our experience so horrible.  Isn't this supposed to be fine dining? then why was my bread and butter literally THROWN onto our table? it was a bit shocking, really.\n\nSo the food finally came (mind you this was a sunday night and the restaurant was NOT packed), and it wasn't anything to rave about.  I've had better steak elsewhere (Prime, Strip Steak, Ruth Chris, Golden Steer,etc), and the sides were OK.  If you do decide to dine here, the bone marrow was good, just a little too red, and the truffle mash potatoes were good but overwhelming (also, our waitress didn't tell us that upgrading to the truffle mash, which was NOT on the menu, that it was an extra $8, or that our side of blue cheese would be extra).\n\nSans good service and food, I will not be stopping by this restaurant again.  It was a horrible experience, with rude staff, and not impressive food.  I'm going back to Strip Steak."

My friend and I decided to split this as a meal and the server asked if we would like the rib eye cut for us which was perfect for us splitting!\n\n- Grilled Maine Lobster: This comes with two perfectly cooked maine lobster tails. I'm glad it came with two because this was another dish me and my friend decided to share. (We made our own \"Surf N Turf\" dinner)\n\n- Black Truffle Mac N Cheese and their Truffled Mashed Potatoes: These were the two sides we decided to order and split between three girls. The portions were perfect. The mashed potatoes were one of the best I ever had. You will not be disappointed if you order any of these sides. It was also a recommendation made by our server.\n\nIf you come here for your birthday, you get a free dessert of your choice and they bring it out with a lit candle and writing in chocolate on the plate saying \"Happy Birthday\"\n\nTheir wine selection here is amazing! This was the very first place that I have ever been to that allows you to order Silveroak by the glass. My favorite!!!"

I have been a few times and really like the style of the room and quality of the steaks. \n\nWe started our most recent trip at the bar with a couple of martinis. Very well made and very friendly service from the bartender. We had mentioned that we were having dinner inside and he offered to have our bill transferred, but we paid the man, as we didn't want him to lose out on the tip. We only waited about 5 minutes and our table was ready. \n\nIt seems every time we dine at Jean George's, the tasting menu is where we go for our food selections. It's a great price around $80 for 4 courses, and has a jalapeno-relish foie gras course that I really dig. We often add to this menu with an additional side item or appetizer, but I find it to be a lot of what I like about the restaurant. The food is great, and t he steaks for the main course are always prepared just the way we ask with exceptional flavor. \n\nI have to say that over the past few times I have ben there - service has not been consistent. The service staff that handles the food always seems a bit 'ho-hum' with their service style. It's not about the casual nature or a friendly demeanor, both things which I appreciate about a server.. but just a kind of a lack of interest maybe? Could be they are amongst the busiest places at the ARIA Hotel, so maybe there is just no time for personal service? It never leaves me impressed, but that's just me. \n\nI will say that the Sommelier's and bar staff are always extremely friendly and attentive with service.  Every bottle of wine is attended to properly and  never has my glass been empty or even less than plenty :) To add to that, the dining room is situated that I don't feel i have ever had a undesirable table. The most recent trip had us sitting up against the glass room that held the wall of wine for the restaurant. really nice space.\n\nI would most-definitly go back to Jean Georges again, as it is very good food, and I do like the atmosphere. I say start in the bar with a good stiff drink and have a great bottle of wine with your steaks! Happiest Eating!"

Excellent food and waiter service is alright - sometimes it is wonderful but there have been subpar occasions. What caused me to rate this restaurant two stars is the hostesses standing at the entrance. Before I am even seated, I am put in a sour mood by them. And I'm not saying it was once or that it is just one person. I have returned to this restaurant several times and every time, I am greeted by a rude glammed up woman who speaks as if she owns the restaurant. I have been refused a table for two different reservations before, being told that the restaurant is fully booked for the evening, then after speaking to someone of higher authority, given an empty table and witnessing a not even half full dining area. You may think, maybe the restaurant will fill up. Wrong. During the duration of an approximately 2 hour long meal, the restaurant is still barely filled 50%. So what should you take away from my review? The restaurant serves quality food, but I hope somebody will address the poor service at the door."

It was at least a 4oz pour with the wine -times four -including Champagne & Madeira. We had to ask the server to slow it down as they were bringing the glasses for the next tasting before we could finish the last wine.  This was our second wine pairing dinner and I think it will be our last as it is too rushed for the quantity of wine.  The dessert of chocolate mousse & mint ice cream was a \"Fail\".  The mousse was dense & dry.  Ice cream was tasteless/icy & \"crumbly\". Chocolate wafers, chocolate cookie crumbs, and crunchy chocolate pearls-way too much.  Sorry but this dessert was something a 5 year old would have put together.  More stuff is just....well more.  Service was ok. I know multiple servers must work well for the restaurant but not so much for the customer.  No one really checking back in with you.  Overall the experience lacked any \"wow\" factor for the expense."

I should have known something was a miss when the guy seated to our rear had shorts, was wearing a hoodie and the tables were without tablecloths..The food was not good at all. The Rib-eye steak had a very gamey taste as if it were old. The asparagus was worst than anything I'v ever seen at the 99 cents store. Way yo big  and chewy. The baked potato was OK. the Pretzel bread was way too salty. Never got a drink refill. The bill for 4 of us was $400.00. This place does not compare to the Steak house in the Circus Circus, and cant hold a candle to Hugo's Seller in the Golden Nugget. Do your self a favor and steer clear of this place.  Michael"

            "review": "For a high end name like Jean Georges, this restaurant is ridiculously amateur and low-class.  The substandard food and questionable dimly-lit dining room do nothing to improve the eating experience.  \n\nFirst, my girlfriend and I were poorly greeted by the two hostesses.  When we approached them, one immediately asked, \"Do you have reservations cause we aren't taking walk-ins you know\" in a Paris Hilton-wannabe tone.  I replied politely that I did with a smile.  She rolled her eyes.  The other hostess gave me a wimpy death stare that looked more like the face of indigestion than one of menace.  The first hostess asked us to follow her into the dining room after confirming the name.  She did not properly sit us down, e.g. failed to hand us our menus or pull out chairs, etc.  If she knew anything about proper dining etiquette, she would not have stacked the menus on the plates like some ogre playing Jenga (tm).  She abruptly walked away without saying a word.  Nevertheless, I was determined to salvage this experience.    \n\nUnfortunately as the evening marched on, I learned that it was not going to happen.  Our food was sub-par.  The foie gras was okay.  The bread was heavily buttered.  My plate was very greasy the moment I laid the bread piece down.  Unfortunately, this made the already rich course even denser.  The lobster caesar (a special request) was plain, but decent.  My girlfriend and I ordered the New York and filet mignon respectively as our main courses.  They were perfectly cooked, but UNBEARABLY SALTY to the point that they were inedible.  When I complained about the entree to the waiter (slightly over-weight, 30-ish, and bald), he said, \"I am sorry you feel that way\" and walked away.  I could have raised a storm and complained even further, but I decided it was not kosher to cause a scene. \n\nAfter drinks and dessert, my tab was ~$330 for 2 people.  Now ask yourself this... would you pay that much for a watered-down version of a Jean Georges restaurant with poor food and service?  If you crave for a Vongerichten restaurant, treat yourself to a flight to NY and eat there.\n\n==== UPDATE ====\n\nI received a message from a dummy account -- which might have been from an employee or someone related to the restaurant -- attempting to shoot down my review.  Here's what he/she wrote:\n\n\"The consistency of this review is totally inacurate. JG had never had a lobster caesar, and hostes don't present dinner menus either, the server does.\" -- Ramon L.\n\nI responded...\n\n\"Before you claim a review is inaccurate, note that your experiences and opinions may be different from mine.  In my case, the hostess planted our menus on our plate.  Our waiter was not even prepared to greet us until a couple of minutes later as he was fussing with two other staff members near the back cashier.  Even if the hostess was not trained to hand us our menus properly, this does not excuse her unprofessional demeanor during the entire greeting process.\n\nAlso, the lobster caesar was a request -- it did the job, but it was not special or elevated.  I edited the review to make a note of the 'special request' to avoid further confusion.  Also, if you are questioning the validity of my review, I have photos on my cellphone ([two] of which are uploaded on Yelp!) and a credit card bill. ;)\""

I will give him the benefit of doubt since I don't even know who he is. But the clowns that work here and especially those responsible for selecting and cooking the cuts of meat need to go back and start from scratch. \n\nA NY strip steak had the appearance, texture and taste of a sirloin you would get from the meat department right before its expiration date. Side dishes were sadly the highlight, which isn't saying much. Damn, I wish I remembered the other aspects of this horrible meal but its probably a good thing I don't. \n\nI will rejoice when I hear this place has closed down and Jean Georges has decided to retire from the restaurant biz."

The menu had been preselected with one table-wide appetizer, and three to five choices of soup/salad, entree and dessert.  All of the choices appear on the regular menu. \n\nThe table started with the chilled seafood platter, with an awesome selection of oysters, shrimp, crab claws and crab legs. There were multiple cocktail and other sauces - I'm sure this appetizer cost a fortune, but it was truly extraordinary. \n\nI chose the Burrata Mozzarella (salad), with tomato, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The burrata could have used more salt but it was very fresh and really nice.  Not your average grocery store tomatoes, and good luck finding obviously handmade cheese like this - really nice dish. \n\nHow disappointing then that my medium rare NY Strip Steak was overcooked to at least medium - that shouldn't happen at a Jean Georges restaurant. No red, just a bit of pink in the middle.  The steak also tasted bland. I wasn't a big fan of the mushrooms either.  The mashed potatoes were awesome and probably had as much butter as they did potato.\n\nMy dessert confirmed the steak was an aberration.  The chocolate cake was ridiculous. Not too sweet but just bitter enough and perfectly melty on the inside with a rich ball of ice cream. Excellent. \n\nTwo comments on the service. While it was fantastic overall (they were cool when we lingered after closing time), it was annoying when the staff kept asking whether I was having flat or sparkling water, and then when one didn't ask somebody topped off my flat water with sparkling water - not cool. Then it was annoying when a photographer cajoled us into taking a souvenir photo of the table. Then she wanted $20 for each print.  Really guys?  At Jean Georges?\n\nOverall the dinner was great, and special thanks go to our hosts. Great place."

Since I was in town for business I decided to have a nice dinner rather than blowing the credit at the bar. \nThe service was great. Friendly.\nI went with a New York strip steak with Brussell sprouts as my side. The steak was great quality and was accompanied by 3 different types of sauces. Bernaise, JG Sauce (which was like a BBQ sauce) and 3rd sauce (can't remember what kind) which was spicier. All 3 sauces were really good but my top choice was the bernaise. The brussell sprouts were phenomenal. They were crunchy and came with pears which were a nice combination. I would return just for the b sprouts. I don't know that I'd return for the NY strip but there are other good looking options. The $100 credit was the catalyst as to why I visited. The service was really good and the food was great. I would return, especially with another resort credit."

We shared some sides and the truffle mashed potatoes were so good that when everyone was done I licked the spoon and plate clean.. okay, well maybe just the spoon. My friends might have pulled the plate away from me.\n\nThe nigiri sushi stacked on crispy rice was a stand out pairing with the steaks. My husband and I arrived late from out of town so our friends ordered us a rib eye and the sushi to create a \"surf and turf\" experience and we were very happy! The sushi was simple but the fish was fresh and the crispy rice provided a nice texture to offset the delicate tender sushi pieces of hamachi, maguro, and sake (salmon) - so a modern touch to classic nigiri staples. \n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant - dark, mysterious, and chic. Lots of artistic touches around the restaurant to gander at while waiting for food and catching up with old friends or also great for romantical dins.\n\nSince we came late, I'm not sure how crazy my friends had been before we arrived, but our waiters did not seem pleased with us being there. I felt like it was a hassle that I ordered food and there was rushed feeling when I ordered my drink. I had the Boulevardier and had trouble pronouncing it so the waiter corrected me but in a tone that brought me back to grade school in English class when my teacher would correct my pronunciations. I still have trouble pronouncing Boulevardier now but geez! I realize that it must be hard dealing with people that are drunk all the time... I mean we are in Vegas... but I had a good excuse, I was just tired from the long drive to Vegas. I was hungry and was not drunk, so I apologize for being an inconvenience. I apologize for my friends enjoying too many cocktails and ordering so much food at the restaurant that we took 3 hours there. \n\nIn summary, the food and decor was super memorable! The front hostesses were super friendly. The guys who cleared are table were quick to clean and efficient. Our waiters seem to strongly dislike our group so service was awkward and slow but just for us. Your experience may be entirely different so please disregard my service comment. I still do recommend this place because the food and ambiance was really good."

The Iceberg Lettuce was crisp and juicy....the thick slices of Bacon added a ton of flavor to it....yum!\n\nThe Better Half enjoyed the Shrimp Cocktail.  She almost got full off the Jumbo Shrimp.\n\nI had the Filet, which was heavenly.  Juicy, charred just right, and full of flavor.  It comes with a choice of sauce and I always get the JG Steak Sauce.  The sauce compliments the Steak and doesn't overwhelm the natural flavor of the Beef.\n\nThe Black Truffle Mac n Cheese is spectacular as well.  Very rich and creamy.\n\nThe prices at this joint are not for the budget-minded diner.  Don't fool yourself....if you don't want to spend the money, don't dine here...you'll be disappointed.  However, if you want a great meal in a chic restaurant with awesome service, then this place is for you.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%"

I love everything about this restaurant, from a sexy decor, to great service, to food that makes my taste buds oh so happy! It is quite pricie, but worth every penny. Dinner for 4 included: 4 tomahawk steaks, 2 lobster mash potatoes, foie gras, grilled bone marrow, calamari, and 4 drinks for a grand total of $630 plus tip. The Tomahawk steak isn't on a menu, so you have to ask for it. If there are 4 or more people in your party that will order that particular steak, call ahead of time and make sure they will have it available for your dinner. Those steaks are pure perfection! This time we ordered lobster mash potatoes, but since I am not a fan of lobster, my preference goes to truffle mashed potatoes."

            "review": "There are a plethora of steakhouses in Vegas. I was staying at Aria and my stay included a resort credit that i opted to use at Jean Georges. If someone is looking for a truly romantic spot for dining, this is truly the place. First off, the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. It's dimly lit and illuminated by candlelight for a fully romantic effect. Now, like most Vegas casino steakhouses, one must be prepared to pay a premium. Since i was using my resort credit i didn't have to worry about that. Now to the meal. \n\nAppetizer: bacon wrapped shrimp. Absolutely delicious, but ridiculously priced for such a small portion. I know it's an appetizer, but damn! Lol!\n\nMain Course:  New York strip. I only eat medium rare steak, with an emphasis on rare. But when i got my steak and cut near the tip, it just didn't have nearly the pink that it should have had. I flagged the waiter down and he suggested i cut more away from the tip. Sure enough it was cooked perfectly the rest of the way. However, i was disappointed that it wasn't pink all the way through. I didn't voice my concern to the waiter and was fully prepared to enjoy the steak. Here's what seperates great service from mediocre service: Apparently he had observed my look of disappointment after i cut into the meat, because lo and behold, a few moments later the manager came over and profusely apologized and offered to totally redo it. Wow! talk about service!! I was sooooo impressed. i informed her that that wasn't necessary and that the steak was really welled seasoned and very juicy. And it was. They brought out several types of steak sauces, but none were required because the flavoring of the steak was really good by itself.\n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant, especially if you are already staying at Aria. Really no need to venture out elsewhere."

The night of our reservations, we wanted to try to eat earlier and called about 2 hrs before asking if we could move our reservations up about 30 mins to an hour. I was told that they're completely full, so we had to keep our reservations for 8:30. When we arrived at 8:20, the restaurant was half empty. We shook our heads wondering why we couldn't have our reservations up, but oh well, we were seated promptly.\n\nI ordered the NY Strip steak, while my girlfriend ordered the Filet Mignon. I also ordered mash potatoes as my side, which I was told by the waiter there was enough for two. When it came out, it was serving for one, which I could of easily consumed two bowls without any problem. My girlfriend decided to let me eat the entire (small) bowl of mashed potatoes, while she ate the corn, which was the other side we ordered. Other than the small portion, the mashed potatoes were delicious!!!  Our steaks were cooked perfectly to order.\n\nWe'd go back again, but would like to see the restaurant offer larger portions for sides."

Dim lighting, quiet atmosphere and very elegant, yet nothing over the top. Can be for a romantic dinner for two or even a nice dinner with close family and friends. \n\nService:\nImpeccable service!! We were treated like royalty. Unfortunately we were on a bit of a time crunch and the server and chef all helped make our dining experience great while making sure we were out by a certain time. Jean George, you have a great group of staff!\n\nFood:\n--Oysters: Yum. Fresh. That's all I ask. They're the smaller sized oysters so nothing too messy. Comes with a mignonette, cocktail sauce, lemons, and tabasco. Plenty of options to suite your taste.\n--Lobster Mash: So happy to hear they had this on their menu at the time of my visit. Very rich lobster flavor, but not much lobster bits...which I prefer having. But it does come in a standard side dish size, which great (I expected a much smaller portion).\n--Lobster tail: To compliment the lobster they gave us lemon, margarine, and a minty pesto sauce. Surprisingly loved the hint of minty flavor!! \n--Bone in rib eye: Cooked to perfection. Very juicy. Loved the 4 sauces Jean George provides to pair with. \n\nOverall, the food was good. A good steakhouse. Good food. Great sauce compliments as recommended. I liked the food but am not dying to come back. However I really did enjoy the service. Round of applause for the staff!!"

            "review": "This is supposed to be one of the best restaurants in the country. I was super excited to eat here, but it is nothing special.\n\nI've eaten at every famous steakhouse you can name. SW, STK, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Mark Joseph, Del Frisco's, Porterhouse, Michael Jordan's, BLT, Wolfgang, 212, Striphouse, Uncle Jack's, BLT Prime, Bobby Van, Frankie & Johnnie's, Smith & Wollensky, Charlie Palmer, Palm, Capitol Grill, N9NE, Echo & Rig... and these are all better than JG.\n\nI don't eat meat anymore, so I ordered shrimp cocktail, burrata salad, and the diver scallops.\n\nI have high expectations of service here, and most were met, but it can be the little things that make it less than fabulous.\n\nOur front waiter was a nice, experienced girl who was well versed in the menu and restaurant but has no idea when to stop, as in she doesn't shut up. She over sells. She can't read people. And she comes across as totally like a robot.\n\nHer job is over once she takes your order.  Then the food expediters and back waiter take over.\n\nMy shrimp cocktail came with two sauces. The cocktail sauce was watery and ordinary and not even enough to consume the 4 large shrimp. I have no idea what the other sauce was but it was not appealing. I was dipping my shrimp in the cocktail sauce and was already down two shrimp when the back waiter showed up with my spoons to use on the sauce.  Bring me what I need to enjoy the food BEFORE the food shows up, so that was a strike against the type of service I expect from a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nThen my Burrata salad arrived and it was only mediocre.  The tomatoes were so cold, which tomatoes are not supposed to be, they lose their flavor, and the homemade burrata had a great texture but no flavor.  I think this salad was not freshly made but was premade and sat in a cooler because  the tomatoes were just under frozen.\n\nThen the scallops arrived.  They were topped with bread crumbs and laid on a very spicy sauce, and I love spice but this one was just not a good one. It was spice with dill, which I don't think is a good combination. I only at half before I was sick of the sauce.  I expect scallops to be crispy on the outside and tender inside. These were tender through out and just uneventful.\n\nOne guest had a filet mignon. It came perfectly cooked as he requested medium. What I don't understand is the mint sauce they include with every sauce. I like the presentation, that the sauce arrives in a marrow bone with a tiny spoon.  However, they then bring four more sauces, one is bearnaise, and the rest I didn't pay close enough attention.  I have never been to a steakhouse of this caliber that offers this many sauces, and we all thought it was overkill to bring five. Why is one on the plate and then four on the side. It's odd. I think if a steak needs a sauce, it either sucks or the diner has a very amateur palette.\n\nOther guest got salmon & shrimp and she enjoyed that.\n\nWe got the lobster mashed potatoes, which are really puree, like baby food. I don't care for that. It's nearly a soup. It tasted good but was too runny to get on your fork.\n\nWe also ordered the creamed corn, which isn't creamed corn at all.  It's fancy corn.  It tasted good, but wasn't what we expected.  They removed the corn from the husk and throw spices on it.  It's not creamy at all.\n\nAnd we had fries, which tasted good, but I didn't feel at all they were freshly cut fries which was shocking. They were too perfect shaped and in their consistency, like they were mass produced and from a frozen bag and air fried."

King Crab legs to the excitement of the Lady at the table while the city's crunchiest fried Chicken found itself challenged by another Bird, the Holiday-only Duck Breast rosy and rich with seared Foie Gras and a crust of crumbled Jordan Almonds. \n\nExcelling again with sides, the humongous Bone Marrow presentation again drawing looks from across the room, traditional creamed Spinach found itself joined by two new dishes, the mixture of mashed and crispy Spuds topped in White Truffles pure and elegant while the Brioche Bread Pudding immediately found itself amongst the year's best dishes with melted Cheese and fibrous Fungi beneath a veil of Tuber melanosporum.\n\nNo longer featuring the talents of Darcee Lynn on Pastry, the menu thus unchanged since last visit, old classics still managed to justify their gastrointestinal real estate, Chef Vongerichten's Molten Chocolate Cake again cited as sparking the phenomenon while Honey Panna Cotta and the sweet-n-salty Sundae were tasty, but no comparison to the skillet Apple Pie that remains unparalleled in the Las Vegas market.\n\n***** A rare meal in which no plate was less than reference standard, the combination of top-tier ingredients and a skilled kitchen even more prone to please than usual during a slow night, Jean Georges Steakhouse remains an under-discussed gem in a city brimming with options, a return visit for the Spring menu already anticipated, and not coming soon enough."

Our bartender whipped up perfect cocktails and we enjoyed the atmosphere and a couple chats. The atmosphere is dim, romantic, and the art compliments the restaurant.  We asked our server what it was of and if you get a chance to check it out, it's the skeleton of an ox's nose painting (we were trying to figure it out the whole night.) We notified the hostess we were ready and were promptly seated. We started our evening with appetizers.  I had a choice of fried calamari which was cooked to perfection and came out HOT (a pet peeve when tempura comes out cold) with a mayo based sauce to accompany it which was absolutely fantastic, The boyfriend had foie gras and everything on the dish complimented one another.  For entrees I went with the chefs special lobster tail was nice but I might've opted for a different dish. The boy ordered soy glazed ribs which was melt in the mouth (licking the plate clean delicious lol!)

Not so. Cough up another $14 each for yummy truffled mashed potatoes or creamed spinach. The Caesar salad was the most uninspired I've ever had outside of an airport, with croutons that were clearly bulk packaged. A true embarrassment to the menu. The only redeeming factor was that the salad was cold - a nice counterpoint to the rest of my meal (and the only compliment I could come up with). Come for the beef, suck down a stiff cocktail, and enjoy the people show; otherwise you'll be left with the bitter taste of con in your mouth."

It was one of the best things i've ever ate.  NIce, plump juicy big shrimp wrapped in bacon with the perfect bite of saltiness from the bacon.  I almost done wet my pants bfore my steak arrived.\n\nNext came my 18 ounce rib eye...Insane amount of food.  They were very nice to offer 2 complimentary sauces on the side.  I highly recommend the Homemade Hot Sauce.   We also go thte Soy-Miso Butter which was also good.\n\nI like to eat my steak plain usually but it was nice to alternate bites between the sauces.\n\nIn addition to the pre-fix, we also ordered the Black Truffle Mash Potatoes - SITM \"S3X in the Mouth\" alert!!!\n\nI can't stop raving about this place.  If you're looking for a fine dining LV strip steak house, check this place out.   If i was ballen in the mix, I'd be up here all the time!"

            "review": "Food is the soul of the restaurant, and this one failed to deliver. \n\nThe ingredient was excellent. Certified Kobe beef was delicate and juicy, the dried age steak as good meat flavor, the prime filet was tender, lobster was fresh. However, the preparation failed the ingredient.\n\nOverall, the food was too salty, taking away the flavor of the meat. Kobe and other good cut of beet only need light seasoning to bring out the meat flavor, but instead the salt over powered all other senses. Part of the steak was also unevenly charred.\n\nIn addition to steaks, I also ordered the miso Sea Bass. The fish was overcooked, over salted, and edge of one side was charred. \n\nIronically, the best feature of the night was the Tristan Lobster tail. Normally at a steak establishment, ordering seafood comes with some risk. This \"steak addition\" however became the saving grace of the dinner. I would go as far as recommending skipping the steak altogether, and just get the lobster tail, it was nicely cooked, with excellent flavor and supple mouth feel. The bone marrow was also tasty, with a nice display of the whole 1/2 femur. Service was also excellent, wait staff was very attentive.\n\nIf you are looking for a good lobster tail, this is your place to eat. Otherwise if you are looking for a good steak, keep moving on... Just because it's expensive doesn't mean it's good."

The lobster tail was huge..the biggest we've encountered yet. My filet as excellent but nothing compared to Wagyu, which was tender beyond words. Samples of all their homemade sauces came out  with our entrees..all were great.  As far as the side go, the garlic mashed potatoes were perfected, the creamed spinach not so much.

The squid was decadently tender and just melted in your mouth. I regret to say that it was a bit on the salty side but we weren't unhappy enough to send it back, but Boris gave us another pelligrino on the house for it. The siracha mayo has this lemon tang to it. Super delicious. I just don't understand why they gave you a whole bowl of the sauce. You really don't even use 1/30th of it. Lol.\n\nShared the prime rib special with my brother, and it was really good. First of all, this dish was meant to be shared so it was massive. I can't remember how many ounces it was but we had trouble finishing it. It had a breaded crust that packed on some great flavor and there were so many sauces to use if you aren't too fond of the cilantro thyme herb (Boris listed all the ingredients, but I just remember a lot of greens) butter that it comes with. Everyone else's steaks were cooked to perfection as we'll. be warned! That tomahawk rib eye is huge, and you should consider sharing it if you plan on getting sides like we did. \n\nLobster mashed potatoes were not so great because it was served like a pur\u00e9e, which is definitely not what I'd look for in mashed potatoes. The black truffle Mac and cheese is soooo good. I'd get an order to share! The mushrooms were also a nice side and I would order again if I ever came back. \n\nWould I come back? Yeah if I won money gambling. Haha! It was definitely not light on the pocket. Overall, I want to give this place 3.5 since the food stood out but there were some issues with the food as mentioned above, but for Boris I'll round up!"

However, this Vegas Steakhouse is fantastic and I would go here over the other Vegas Steakhouses any day.\n\nI started off with my standard Caesar salad.   Hard to screw up (though some places manage to!) but there are various ways to make it notable (see my Strip House review).  Many places use big, thin fresh cuts of parmesan but Jean Georges takes a different tack.  The parmesan is grated so small and light that it literally seems fluffy and melts immediately on the tongue.  NICE.\n\nNext was the sweetbreads.  If a chef is willing to serve this, he knows his stuff, and these were cooked in an extremely (and mercifully) light sesame truffle sauce.  Very good, and a nice change from typical steakhouse fare.\n\nNormally I like to go for the filet, but when I see a soy-glazed short rib, I have to have it.  It's literally a compulsion.  I can get a great filet any time in NYC, and I'm glad I went with the short rib because it was amazing.  I think even better than the short rib at BLT prime because of the soy glaze.  Served up with a side of creamed spinach and a glass of South Australian Shiraz, it really hits the spot."

Only drawback was a bit of a constant sell to buy more items (side dishes, etc.). \n   We arrived for a 9:45P reservation on Friday night (New Years Day), had a round of Caipirinhas, which were excellent (and potent), then were promptly escorted to a corner table for our party of 5. The decor was modern and warm, but not wow-ing. \n   We ordered the following appetizers:\n1) Fresh Oysters: Decent oysters, not off the San Francisco peer or anything, but good nonetheless. Garlic/vinegar sauce was nice to go with.\n2) Sweet Breads: My first time trying these, therefore no real comparison on quality. I enjoyed this dish.\n\nEntrees: Steaks (of course)\nPorterhouse Steak: Probably one of the best cuts I've had in a long time. A generous portion of fillet, to go along with a good looking New York strip, this porterhouse was only simply seasoned and cooked perfectly. The porterhouse was a 24 oz. cut/$60. I would highly recommend this dish.\n\nRib-Eye:\n   Others in my group had bone-in rib-eye steaks which they thoroughly enjoyed (as revealed through the shiny bone left on the plate when finished), also simply seasoned. As a further note, instead of traditional market steakhouses, freshly made in-house sauces were prepared. Each was interesting and added to the experience, however, nothing really added more than enjoying the steak as is, simply seasoned. \n   The downside of the experience at this restaurant came with the side dishes. The portion per side dish sparingly served two people and was extremely pricey for the quality of the side dish. For example, I believe 7 pieces of asparagus with a bit of garlic and lemon cost $14 per plate. Servings of mashed potatoes were small as well. The side dish of mushrooms was excellent, but also quite small. Honestly, I was expecting the restaurant to be less stingy with these dishes. \n    As for dessert, we had a run of the mill chocolate lava cake and a really interesting, delicious japanese citrus and white chocolate sorbet. This dessert was a nice combination of sour and sweet and was unlike any sorbet I've had before. Unfortunately I forgot the name of the fruit that was used. \nOverall, not including drinks, the dinner came to ~80/person."

The Wagyu fares no better; with poorly sourced meat sadly charred on a plate with a quaint plastic marrow bone holding a faux asian sauce to mask the taste of a cheaply procured; poorly cooked piece of meat. The creamed spinach is a bowl of rancid cream with spinach fragments - inedible.\n\nSave your time and money and go to Serrano, the only restaurant in the Aria that gives a damn.

Tuna tartare was prepared in the same generic fashion found in any number of restaurants. Tuna + citrusy/tomatoey/cilantro mix + some form of avocado + chip(s). The best part about this dish was the shrimp chip. Very light and crisp.  The foie gras was good. The portion was pretty small, even for a tasting menu. Sea bass was good. Nice crust and the broth complemented the fish well. The steak on the tasting menu was a petite filet. The filet was good, for a filet. It was cooked properly. The grilled mushroom that came with it was pretty good. The desert item was one of those chocolate lava cakes w/ ice cream. I'm not particularly fond of sweets, but the cake was really good. The cake wasn't too flourly and it was packed with oozing chocolate.  I enjoyed watching it ooze, probably more than I should have. \n\nThe guys working at the bar were cool and very attentive.

This NYC Spica Market inspired location in Vegas is truly representative of it's Manhattan origin. Great decor and smooth lounge music add for an excellent ambience"

I had the 10 oz filet which took more than the norm to have our entrees delivered (being a 4-star and all). Not only was EVERYTHING HEAVILY salted, but my steak was burnt on the exterior. However, the ambiance was excellent & my pal got a Birthday YUMMY dessert on the house."

I think we got there right when it opened because the staff all gave us attention and the sommelier even stopped and chatted and recommended a Bordeaux that was a great value just to be nice.  I hesitated to accept the recommendation, but he stated it was a personal recommendation so we took the plunge.  It turned out to be a perfect selection for our tastes.  \n\nWe had such a great experience at this restaurant.  All of the food was exceptional.  We had a wedge salad, and the ribeye with a side of mushrooms and crunchy potatoes.  The only thing bad was I felt like the steak was a little thin.  Seriously, that is the only thing.  I can't take away a star for that.  I cant wait to try his other restaurant at the Bellagio!"

It is dark, but I think all good steakhouses should be a little dark.\n \nService was very good. Not exceptional and will explain that in a moment. The hostess was very kind and efficient. We checked in and waited at the bar for the other member of our party to arrive. When he did the hostess lead him to us at the bar and we were seated immediately. \nOur servers (there were two) we very knowledgeable about the menu and were extremely pleasant. However the one server would always interrupt our conversation. After the third time it got annoying. Please wait until at least we finish a sentence before you start to ask questions! If it wasn't for that the service would have been 5 stars. Also, two of us wanted to do the tasting menu, but they refused saying that everyone at the table has to do the tasting menu. Our server informed us that the chef refuses to allow any exeptions to this because it is 5 courses and it ruins the experience if it is not enjoyed by everyone. Really? I find that hard to believe. Everyone ordered an app and 3 of us got dessert an 2 people got salad. That was hard to believe and kind of aggravated us from the start. \n\nThe food was very good, but not really worth the price. We had caesar salad and foie gras to start.  Both were good, but the foie gras (at $28) wasn't worth the price.  However, I had the special which was a 300 day dry aged Australian porterhouse. That was probably the most flavorful steak I've ever had. Everyone else's meal was very good, but each agreed that they have had a better meal. For sides we had saut\u00e9ed spinach (they originally brought out creamed spinach and had to correct it, but they did this very quickly). We also had mashed potatoes (awesome), lobster mashed potatoes (even more awesome, but that side cost $21- ouch), and a bone marrow app that was very good. \nWe had dessert which was good, but not incredible. And after such a rich meal just couldn't finish it. We had the apple crisp with cinnamon ice cream (the ice cream was amazing) and a warm chocolate cake. The cake was good, but so rich we could hardly eat it, even splitting between 2 people. \n\nPrice was pretty expensive. Our dinner was $400 before tip and we did not have any alcohol at all. And one person in our party only had chicken as an entree because they do not eat red meat. \nI think for these prices everything you order should be spot on. And I can say that out of everything we ordered only a few things stood out as exceptional - Bone marrow side dish, lobster mashed potatoes (but very pricey), and my 300 day dry aged porterhouse. Oh, and the cinnamon ice cream. \nI can think of a few other steakhouses in Vegas that I would rather go than this place again. BOA is good, and I still love Capital Grill and Morton's is probably my favorite. \nOverall good, I don't regret going there, but I don't think I want to visit this place again given all the other choices in Vegas."

We also got two desserts and they were both excellent. My husband loved his steak as well. We are returning in July and we will be going back for sure. Very relaxing atmosphere.

First time (when Aria just opened), our Cosmo concierge sent us there (and it was the only place that could accommodate our group on a short notice). Our first experience was great.\n\nThis year, what a different story! Let me start with the positives: d\u00e9cor still seems relevant, the meat is still good (though not amazing). Crab (though the tiniest of portions) tasted fresh and excellent. Tomato soup was very good.\n\nNow the bad: the service! Water not refilled (see other reviews, all true, had to ask for it every time!). Salad and vegetable menu rather tired and uninspired. Tiniest and pricey side portions and humongous hunks of meat (even our biggest guys left at least half of their steaks on the table). My tomato salad had a loooong black hair in it (!). Disgusting.\n\nA SEPARATE MENTION: our group consisted mostly of men, business associates, with healthy appetites. We all ordered a lot, appetizers, meats, etc. However, the waitress (a blond woman) stooped to harassment and kept pushing one of the guests, a young lady, to order something in addition to the soup she asked for. Our guest politely refused every push to order extra food, and the waitress was getting progressively more and more annoyed and showing it very clearly. She wouldn't quit pressuring the girl and almost drove her to leave. The waitress proceeded to be visibly annoyed whenever a less than the most expensive choice was made for any reason by any other guest. Only the fact that it was a company dinner and that I did not want to make a scene prevented me from contacting the management on the spot. Soon after, the waitress lost any interest in attending to our table whatsoever. She returned one more time to loudly inquire if the same young guest \"had finally changed her mind\" about getting more food (she did not). We were left to fend for ourselves and to seek help (like asking for utensils) from random busboys. No manager ever came by to check on our large group.\n\nIn short: food just OK, service a shame. We were left with the impression the restaurant couldn't care less. Spend your money elsewhere (like the superb Bazaar Meat which ended up costing us less and providing an amazing dining experience)."

When you see the bill below, you'll be amazed that she remembered all of it without writing anything down.\nWe started with the sushi sampler, hamachi, tuna tartare, and a Caesar salad. The sushi had two pieces each of salmon, tuna, and yellow tail (I think) on crispy rice. It was very good but surprisingly thin at $24. The hamachi was also very good though not amazing. Tuna tartare was very good as well. I know it's odd, but I was craving the salad. It was actually quite good, but laughable at $16. It must have cost them 75 cents to make it.\nFor our entrees, my cousin had a tomahawk chop rib eye and an 8 oz lobster tail. His ribeye was amazing! I had an 8 oz filet and 8 oz lobster tail as well. Both were quite good. I really enjoyed the sauce selections as well. We mashed potatoes that were excellent. Had to be at least 50% butter.\nFor dessert, he had a warm chocolate cake (with the molten center) and ice cream. I had an apple pie with bourbon ice cream. It was fantastic.\nThis was one of the best meals I've had in Vegas...and I've been to most steakhouses. I admit that I've never been to Gordon Ramsey's place. I highly recommend it.

I just do not understand why they never give enough bread for these dishes ( that applies to all restaurants ).. But no big deal, they'll give you more. Good selection of wines by the glass and the Grand Marnier souffle was to die for. Service was impeccable."

Missing a star because my medium rare filet minon came with a warm pink center but my husband's medium rare ribeye came with a cool pink center.  Despite this, however, the meat was first grade, the sauces that accompanied the steaks were amazing, and the ambiance was classy and chic.  We had the early dinner menu which, at $69/person was a steal.  We truffle fries were to die for and my starter burrata salad melted in my mouth."

Our reservations was at 9PM, we were seated at 9:20PM. We didn't get our water for about another 20 minutes. By the time we flagged down the waiter, we were ready to order. We asked for the cocktail list and that also took forever. Appetizers came out in a timely manner. Dinner came out 40 minutes after we were done with the appetizers. The couple sitting next to our table received their meal in a timely manner and before us even though they came in about 30 minutes after us. We ordered tea and coffee after dinner and had to cancel it because we didn't receive it after 20 minutes. The service here is ridiculous. I thought it was because they were super busy but we still didn't receive our entrees after 2/3 of the restaurant cleared out. \n\nWe complained to the manager and we found him up front chatting with the hostess instead of managing his servers/staff. He was so surprised when we complaint that we figured no one even made him aware of the situation. What a joke. Note to Jean George: hire a manager that takes a more active role in making sure the restaurant flows smoothly.\n\nSide dishes, appetizers, salad was really good. Filets need some work."

Drinks came out quick as they started us off with bread and butter. \n\nI won't speak for the other people at our table but I order the 12 oz. NY strip medium well. The steak was more like medium rare. I was steak did not have much flavor to it, however the sauces they provided were amazing. The sauces added lots of character to the steak. The steak come out warm to cool. I am used to a piping hot steak in Texas.\n\nThe table shared sides, the spinach was really good, lobster mash potatoes were amazing but there were only 4 small pieces of lobster in the potatoes, the macaroni truffle was amazing.\n\nThe ambience was really nice, dim lighting, good music, and classy.\n\nWe were not impressed with the dessert they provided for the Birthday's. I hate complaining when something is free but if that is the best they can do then they missed the mark.\n\nOver all is was a good experience but when I am dropping that kind of money I expect a better steak and sides but I understand it is Vegas. I have had better at STK, Craft steak house, and Vic and Anthony's."

Diners coming to eat this restaurant aren't just looking for great cow meat. We want to be pampered, and I shouldn't have to reach out for my waiter throughout the night. Do smile to customers.  \n\nMy last tip for diners; if the waiter asks you if you want to try 'the special', make sure to check the price. My friend went with it without asking and ended up with a surprising $300+ bill for a plate of steak samplers. \n\nOverall, if they pump up the service, the restaurant would be a true 4+ star restaurant."

It wasn't as good as our dinner at Scarpetta a few days earlier, but was good enough to make me want to go back and eat more.\n\nThe watermelon gazpacho was light and refreshing. The pickled peach and goat cheese salad for the first course was delicious. Loved the depth in flavors and textures with the pistachio and crystallized wasabi.\n\nThe NY strip had some good-looking grill marks and was nicely charred for a medium-rare steak. But it was a bit chewy for my tastes. The crunchy potato and tomato compote that accompanied it were amazing. My wife's soy glazed short rib was one of the best short ribs we've had (second to Fleur de Lys, back in the day).\n\nShe also got the chocolate cake for desert. The one bite I had (that's all she would let me have) was pretty damn good. My key lime pie was fabulous. I loved the pop rocks on top. It was a whimsical addition that added plenty to their modern take on this classic dish.\n\nEven with the RW prices ($50.11 per person) it was pricey after drinks, tax and tip. But that's to be expected from any steakhouse on the Strip. The rest of their menu looked good, so I'll be back to try other dishes."

Unfortunately it was just average.\n\nWe made our reservation ahead of time so we were promptly seated. The hostess and manager who showed us to our seats were very friendly. I didn't care much for the decor as it was a little too avant-garde for a steakhouse. Our server greeted us immediately and told us about the specials, she recited them super fast so we didn't hear half of the things she said. I felt had she slowed her pace a little and gave us a chance to interact, she probably would've sold all of us on the specials.\n\nWe started with the Crispy Shrimp. It was tasty but very small portion to be an appetizer (only 3 shrimp); for our dinner, we ordered the New York strip, the Filet and the Rib-eye. My strip was cooked exactly the way I wanted. Meat was very tender and flavorful, I almost didn't need the miso butter sauce (which was good, a bit salty). My friends seemed to enjoyed their steak as well. We shared some lobster mash (basic mash starts at $10 and prices go up for different kinds of mash - garlic, lobster, etc etc), which was actually the highlight of the meal for me; creamed spinach and grilled Asparagus.\n\nOverall, our food was tasty and our service was great. However, for a five star Vegas establishment I felt the experience was nothing special. I would still recommend this place for people looking for a great steak."

The bone marrow (usually a favorite dish) was disappointing - it was gelatinous and didn't have that spreadable, butter-like quality you would expect.  Lobster mashed potatoes and truffle mac were enjoyable, but not earth shattering (pretty much anything with lobster and/or truffle is going to taste good).  I did like that the creamed spinach was not too heavy, and that you could see the stems on the spinach leaves, indicating they used fresh spinach.  One final complaint - they wouldn't split the bill on more than (I think) 4 credit cards, which was kind of a pain with that large a group (10 ppl) (one would think they'd be more accommodating given the number of bachelor/bachelorette parties and guys/girls' weekends that are likely to be there).

I love the taste of pear, and definitely want to pick up a pear vodka so I can make drinks at home.  The ginger syrup was spicy and gave the drink that addictive little kick.\n\nAPPETIZER: Dungeness Crab Crostini\nMade with garlic aioli, lemon and dill\nPerfect little start to a glorious meal.  Very generous on the crab.  It wasn't a warm dish, and it might've been even better warm.  It was tasty, but out of the whole, it was our least favorite thing.\n\nENTREE:  Wagyu Filet Mignon and the Tomahawk Steak (special)\nI asked for this medium well, which I know is not the ideal temp for a piece of meat like this.  But I prefer it, and it was cooked perfectly.  So juicy, tender and extremely flavorful.  My husband's Tomahawk steak was a wagyu hybrid, and his was cooked perfectly as well.  Both steaks came with four sauce selections: soy-miso butter, homemade steak sauce, bearnaise, and a super hot (too hot for me) sauce.  Our favorite was the soy-miso butter.\n\nSIDE:  Roasted Brussel Sprouts\nTopped with avocado and pecan\nI love roasted brussel sprouts.  This was a very interesting take with the addition of the avocado.  I probably could have done without it, unless you just like bites with several textures.  The brussel sprouts themselves were charred nicely and had good flavor.\n\nSIDE: Broiled Bone Marrow\nServed with a side of parsley lemon gremolata and toast points\nThe creepiest, most carniverous thing they could sit at the table ended up being one of the best things I've ever eaten.  Who knew?  Putting the marrow on toast and topping it with a bit of the gremolata was just an amazing bite.  The richest most intense beef flavor you can imagine.  I would eat this again in a heartbeat.\n\nDESSERT: Salted Caramel Sundae\nVanilla ice cream topped with fudge sauce, candied peanuts and popcorn\nThis was a cute little dessert, but nothing spectacular about it.  We enjoyed it, it was satisfying, but it certainly wasn't a culinary wonder.  I will say their dessert menu didn't really have anything that interesting on it beside your staple cheesecake, chocolate cake, and apple crisp.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but just an FYI.\n\nOur server was excellent.  Was extremely knowlegable, friendly, and expeditious.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience at Jean Georges.  I would recommend this restaurant with two very enthusiastic thumbs up."

Our water glasses were filled numerous times without us being aware (minor wine buzz?), and we were taken care of for a good two hours. I've been to countless excellent steakhouses (and some legendary) from coast to coast, and this was one of the best filets I've ever had; my colleague said same about his 12 oz. strip steak. The sides were fairly typical of a prime steakhouse but nonetheless, outstanding in quantity and quality.\n\nI'm shocked that with the 5-star service offered up here, plus the 4 complimentary steak sauces presented to every table (how's that for a differentiator), plus the USDA prime beef combined with the ambiance, how this place gets 3.5 stars on Yelp? Obviously, too many complainers bitching about some trivial aspect (as in: my drink was weak, wahhhhh) that prompted them to give this excellent steakhouse a poor review, but my experience was close to 5 stars. When I go back to Aria Hotel, I'm also going back to Jean Georges. Thanks guys, great meal for both myself and business partner. I will return."

However I must say the hostess was retarded. We made reservations but when we arrived the place was dead save one other table. It's a huge pet peeve of mine when host staff seats us in a quiet restaurant next to the only other table in the restaurant thats occupied. I understand keeping people in the server's sections but the place was EMPTY. I requested to be moved and the hostess acted put off and bitchy. Very rude and snotty about it. I graciously blamed it on my father's tendency to tell loud stories after he's had a few glasses of wine--but really there is no excuse for this. If we are going to pay $500 for a meal we want a good experience and that includes being seated in a way that allows us the privacy to enjoy ourselves and our conversation. \n\nOther than that the food was delicious!"

We didn't feel welcomed, she was snobby, and proceeded to laugh after she sat us. The food was too hyped up. It tasted average and it didn't satisfy us for the price they presented. There is an extremely limited option of food there. Overpriced, limited, and rude hosts? We decided never to come back ever again.

            "review": "A beautiful restaurant, initially striking the right balance in atmosphere, neither stuffy steakhouse nor nightclub party with a side of meat, Jean George's is a prime example of unrealized potential. The night was full of slight missteps.\n\nFor example, over half of the seats at the bar were marked as \"reserved\"- resulting in those waiting for their tables not being able to have a cocktail without sitting on the couches in the \"lounge\" (with nowhere to sit your drinks). \n\nWe brought our own wine, but it took awhile before the sommelier asked if we'd like it opened and decanted. Small thing.\n\nWe were very excited about the menu, because there were some really delicious offerings, and the accompaniments- wow! This definitely could be the start of an amazing marriage of surf and turf!\n\nAppetizers started off pretty well. The crab cake took the prize- the marriage between the sweet citrus, the avocado, the crab- light, sweet, and close to perfect. The bacon wrapped shrimp, while good, didn't \"wow\" me. This time, the old adage \"everything's better with bacon\" didn't quite hold true.\n\nNow, the meat!! Prime ribeye, medium (being sure to clarify that it would be a warm, red center), and Australian filet,  medium plus , were on the docket. I also ordered the scallop accompaniment and the lobster mashed potatoes.\n\nLet's start with the positive.. The scallops were pretty close to perfect. Three meaty, tender, and large scallops arrived with my steak. Delicious.\nHowever, the steak itself was pretty average.\nThe center was closer to pink than red, and while seasoned nicely, the steak itself was not very tender. I remember remarking that I'd made better steaks at home on my cast iron skillet. Not bad, but certainly fell short of expectations.\n\nThe filet was even worse- a significant portion of it was gristle, hard to cut into and almost impossible to eat. This one was cooked medium rather than medium plus with the red, warm center, and was also seasoned well, but when 1/2-2/3 of it is inedible... Yeah.\n\nThe lobster mashed potatoes were tasty, but save for one large chunk, there wasn't much actual lobster in there, although it did have good lobster flavor. Are you sensing a trend here? \n\nOk, maybe dessert will salvage things! The server spoke very highly about the apple pie, and that was the only thing that interested me, so why not! \nAgain.. Just ok. Nothing to write home over, but not bad. \n\nSo, all in all... Just an okay experience here. Pity too.. Lots of potential, but execution was lacking."

            "review": "After have a \"taste\" at Sage, we continued our journey to Julian Serrano for part two of our tasting tour of Aria. We had to stand around and wait for a hostess at Julian Serrano that never came. In a resort casino with plenty of other high-end restaurants willing to take our money, we left and wandered upstairs to try Jean George (located on the second floor above the casino next to Sirio and Michael Mina) which promptly assisted us.\n\nObviously, we skipped appetizers and went straight into the main course which was a $90 steak special - the Wagyu-like Australian tomahawk chop (think bone-in rib eye with the dark fatty outer cap trimmed). It was an embarrassing piece of meat. The steak lacked everything you'd expect in a cut of beef. It missed flavor, fattiness, and tenderness.\n\nThen there were the steak sauces. I'm a purist who believes a steak sauce needed for bad, flavorless steaks. A really good steak is perfection on its own. Even though the tomahawk was heavily seasoned and charred to create flavor, five different steak sauces were served. This isn't McDonald's or Chik-Fil-A where customers have a choice of dipping sauces for the chicken nuggets. The chef should make a decision and pick one sauce that fits the flavor profile of their cuisine. Instead, it was a colorful Benetton nation of sauces with an airy French hollandaise, a bright and refreshing Mexican salsa verde, an overly sweet BBQ sauce, a super-hot southwestern scotchbonnet, and a mellow Asian tamarind. Aside from the BBQ sauce, they were all expertly executed, but none were good matches with the steak.\n\nThe sides were thankfully small and a decent-sized for one person. We tried two sides. The Brussels sprouts with pear and bacon had a forceful zing. By itself, the sprouts were dry and not very exciting, but the acidity helped contract the fattiness of beef. The mushrooms with goat cheese polenta were a disaster. This was the second greasy and overcooked polenta I had that night. The mushrooms were sadly dried-out and tough.\n\nThe Mollydooker South Australian Shiraz by the glass was a very nice wine and well suited for the evening.\n\nFor dessert, we had a glass of Moscati di Asti that was a fine match with the cinnamon cr\u00e8me brulee with cocoa nibs and figs on the bottom. The use of cinnamon in a brulee is a very smart decision. I can't believe other chefs haven't done this. It seems like a completely obvious combination, but I guess when something is that obvious, it's easy not to think of it."

Our bartender was friendly and professional, and carried on just the right amount of conversation with us. It may have helped that we're locals who work in the industry, but my instinct is that the service is just very good. They had three beers on tap, Boddington's was one of them, I believe, but I was very thrilled to see that Delerium Tremens was also on tap (an exquisite beer from Belgium) so ordered a glass. Our bartender provided us with small dishes of cashews and buttery rosemary popcorn with fluer de sel on the side to munch on, a great touch. A server also brought around a basket of home-made breads, all of which were good, but the brioche made my day!\n\nWe split the roasted sweetbreads with chestnuts ($22) from the appetizer section, it came out presented nicely and had an intoxicating aroma, but was a very small portion (as can be expected). It was my boyfriend's first time trying sweetbreads, and he was pleasantly suprised by how good they were. The dish was small, but nicely executed, crisp on the outside, tender inside, buttery, nutty, with some shaved black truffles and either a bit of potato, or more probably some fresh water chestnut to play off of the other components.\n\nWe ordered a carmelized banana cake off of the dessert menu (I think $14 but I could be wrong) and it was sublime. The light, fluffy cake was topped with thinly sliced, carmelized bananas, and came with a quenelle of caramel ice cream (my mouth is watering thinking back to it), a tuille cookie, and something crunchy and addictive underneath (I think it was chocolate flavored puffed rice, but I could be wrong) bf practically licked the plate.\n\nFor an appetizer, dessert, and two beers it was about $59 but I felt it was worth it.

Some of the sides, the carrots and potato options were very good actually. The salads were ok at best.\nI was at Jean Georges with a work group, maybe about 8 of us. We all had steaks which were overcooked. It wasn't enough to send it back for anyone, but they were all overcooked (I actually don't mind a medium steak being a bit overdone anyway). Food wise, I would say it was ok, but there are better options, especially at that price range.\n\nThe reason Jean Georges gets ONE STAR is because of the service/scam they tried to pull. We asked for a bottle of a dessert wine which was listed on the menu at about $60 which is the normal price for this wine. There was some confusion about the exact year/quality being ordered because the menu did not give the quality (these wines scored 3-7 by sweetness) but eventually the waitress found the wine and we confirmed it was what we expected. When the bill came, they tried to charge $250 for the wine, an OUTRAGEOUS price. \n\nWe told the waitress she made a mistake, she brought the menu back and made some story about how the wine we ordered was different from what was listed which was 1) entirely false and 2) we were never told that they thought it was a different wine. If a restaurant is under the impression they're serving a wine that's different from what's ordered, how can you serve that without telling anyone?! The waitress refused to be reasonable so we asked to talk to the manager. After a great deal of arguing, the manager seemed to imply the menu was wrong and insisted on the $250 price. Eventually the manager simply gave up and charged us the correct $60 price, but, firstly, you should be comping a $60 dessert wine on an 8 person meal over $1,000 anyway! And after such an ordeal, good service says to comp the wine then! \n\nWe all left feeling frustrated and insulted."

This time around, we found our way to the newest kid on the block:  Jean Georges Steakhouse (conveniently located inside the Aria hotel where we happened to be staying at the time).\n\nFirst, I must comment on the beautiful and stylish decor  inside the restaurant.  The design was immaculate and very chic ... right down to the \"island sinks\" inside the bathroom.  Service was on point including our friendly and very knowledgeable waitress.\n\nAs for the food, well, we started out with the grilled foie gras terrine (what a surprise right? I'm almost positive that I'm addicted to this stuff).  Grilled / terrine? Doesn't quite make sense right? Apparently, thanks to our waitress, the foie is at first grilled then prepared in terrine form - so don't expect it to be seared.  I still am not 100% convinced that I truly liked this preparation - I've certainly had better ... but it certainly was not bad by anyone's standard.  As for the main course, my girlfriend and I decided to split the 28oz bone in rib-eye.  As much as I wanted to like it ... I found the meat a bit uneven when it came to its flavor.  It was at times a bit too salty depending on which area of the steak I was eating ... perhaps this is not unusual ... but this is certainly the first time I've taken notice.  For the sides, we had the truffled mash potatoes and the grilled bone marrow.  The truffled mash was excellent ... one of the best, if not thee best,  preparation of this dish I've ever had.  You can certainly taste the truffle flavor all over this excellent dish.  As for the bone marrow, well, it is INSANE!!!  Never have I had a side dish that consisted of this much bone marrow grilled to perfection.  I actually physically felt my cholesterol jump a few hundred points as I delicately scooped the marrow into my mouth.  It accompanied the rib-eye perfectly along with the gremolata that it was served with. Be warned that this is a huge portion ... so please don't forget to prophylax yourself with your cholesterol lowering drug of choice (mine would be Lipitor). Fearing a massive coronary ... we opted not to have dessert.\n\nOverall, I would give Jean Georges a 3.5 stars - the decor, ambience and service would definitely be a 4-4.5 stars.  As great as the side dishes were, I felt that the ribe-eye wasn't quite up to par (especially compared to the side dishes) and therefore I would have to rate it a 3. Harsh, I realize, but then again this is the land of Carnevino, Cut, SW steakhouse, Craftsteak, Delmonico, Smith & Wollensky among others.  With that much competition within a 10mile radius ... 3 stars is actually not that bad. As great as the setting, ambience and service were ...  in the end,  I felt that Jean Georges, dare I say it, failed to deliver."

I started with a Lychee Raspberry Bellini\n(Fresh Lychee, Raspberry, Prosecco) and it was just the perfect amount of sweetness.  We shared the Crispy Sushi Sampler with chipotle mayonnaise & crispy rice which was delicious.  I'm not sure it was worth $24, but that's what you get on that menu.  For my entree I had the USDA Prime Beef 8 oz Filet Mignon which was cooked perfectly.  My husband had, and loved, the Waygu.  We had a side of the Roasted Trumpet Mushrooms with garlic, jalape\u00f1o & lemon and we were fighting over the last forkful- SO GOOD!  We also had the Black Truffle Mac & Cheese which my husband LOVED, but I thought was lacking a little salt.  I'd totally go back and I'd probably opt to sit at the bar.  Great food, great vibe!"

And there's some cool decor and atmosphere, with the wine list on iPads and modern appeal (even though the walls looked disturbingly like the evil twin of a Monster Energy drink can).  Atmospherewise, the music is weird and I think kind of emo.  Which, also, believe me, I would totally have ignored if the food blew me away.\n\nBut it just didn't!  I was so excited to try all of the sauces offered for the steak... I am a bearnaise man through and through, and was so excited to try that and the hot sauce, and everything!  However, 5 sauces on my rib eye, and none of them were amazing.  - Also at $60+ for an 18 oz. ribeye is crazy expensive... other places offer a way bigger cut for that much- were just not wowing me.  \n\nI will say this, the salted caramel ice cream--- AMAZINGLY GOOD.  Almost pushes this review to 4 stars.  But literally everything else I had was average- bland creamed spinach, truffle mac and cheese that needed more flavor.  I tried one of the dishes on my friend's tasting menue that really put me off too... just tasted like bad sour cream.\n\nI think this place could be great-- and don't get me wrong, I was super grateful for the free meal-- but a little taste and a little more atmosphere could go a long way for some of their stuff.  If it was cheaper, or better atmosphere, or a little more tasty, it would get 4 stars, but mehhh.  I've had better."

My husband ordered a surf and turf, the entry itself cost more than $100 and it came with the lobster way overcooked (they overbaked it).  I ordered a organic chicken, but it came dry and oily.  Mash potato was the best and let me tell you the secret, lots of butter in it.  On top of everything, I ordered two glasses of Pinot for $18 each. On the final bill, I saw a charge of wine for $30 each.  When I inquired, the waiter brought me a wine list which was totally different from the glass wine menu we were presented at the time of ordering.  He turned to the glassed wine page in a very snobbish way.  True, what I ordered was not on the menu.  So I told him the menu I ordered from was a different one.  Minutes later, he came back with the bar menu (I guess) and said casually that the one I ordered was no longer available so he replaced with the more expensive one but he would charge me only $18/glass,  Oh, what a favor he did me!!!  For the price one pays, the quality of food and service is really unacceptable."

It was truly one of the best steakhouse experiences I have ever encountered...several times.\n\nI was lucky enough getting top notch dinners for free here at Jean Georges Steakhouse two nights in a row. I definitely can't complain about anything as the foods were simply superb and on top of it, it didn't cost me anything. Thank you my awesome business partners! \n\nThe first dinner, we had tons of food. We started with Nueske's bacon wrapped shrimps, calamari, and heirloom tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad. You may recall I hate overzealous servers who always boast everything they serve to be the best. This guy did exactly that. He told us it would be the best and lightest calamari we ever tasted. He also said the buffalo mozzarella was bar none and just the most incredible mozzarella ever. Surprisingly, he didn't lie. Holy shit, those calamari and mozzarella were amazing! AMAZING! I didn't mind him so much after I knew he was just telling the truth. \n\nMy filet was perfect, accompanied by half a lobster tail, creamed spinach, mushroom, truffle mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes. Everything was anything you could expect from Jean Georges Vongerichten. \n\nThe next day...though I was less enthused eating at the same exact place, I quickly forgot about it when I sat down and started drinking the house mule cocktail. Whoa! It was so strong and just pure alcohol but it was really good after several days of ass kicking meetings. \n\nNow, I looked forward to the calamari and the bacon wrapped shrimps again. They also ordered the ahi tuna tartare that hit the spot for me. I started to get sick of red meat at this point and decided to share a bone in rib eye with our host. We had most of the same sides as last night plus truffle fries. Mind you.. This truffle fries weren't like any truffle fries you ever had with a douse of icky truffle oil. This one had shavings of real black truffle on top. The mushroom was also a favorite of mine. It was mixture of various kinds of mushroom saut\u00e9ed with jalape\u00f1o so it had a little kick to it. I ate the peppers and it burned as it went down my throat. Yum!!\n\nThe rib eye and the filet were both premium for steak. They also offered a $270 6 oz of Kobe filet. Hahaha...insane!! \n\nBoth dinners were ultra pricy and I was just grateful that I could enjoy these gorgeous delicious food without breaking my bank. It was also great to spend quality times with people I work with every day. \n\nOur server on the second night, Boris, was awesome. He was probably the best server ever and was on top of everything. He catered to our host so much and to all of us in the most courteous manner and at the end, after our host signed the whopping check and handed it to Boris, he shook our host's hand. It was so classy.\n\nI will probably eat here again next year when in Vegas and I can't wait!!"

The restaurant is beautiful and has a lot of darker curved lines through the decor.  Very modern but comfortable.\n\nOur dinner consisted of:\nBacon Wrapped Shrimp w/ papaya Mustard, Cilantro\nButternut Squash Soup w/Ginger and Basil\nBaby Iceberg Lettuce w/Blue Cheese Dressing Crispy Bacon\nSalt and Pepper Maine Lobster w/ Ginger and Scallions Buttery Cabbage\nSoy-Glazed Short Rib w/Apple-Jalape\u00f1o Pur\u00e9e & Rosemary Crumbs\nSalted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae w/Peanuts, Popcorn & Chocolate Sauce\n\nThe only downside: the soup and salad were too big!!!  (a rare complaint for fine dining)  We were trying to save room for desert, and had to take some of the entrees back to the hotel.  (the desert was WELL WORTH IT) \nAlso there's a gentleman who goes around offering to take table-side photos for quite a high price (we heard the couple at the table next to us.  one large photo and two small for $75!! )  I've never been a fan of being disturbed during dinner- though to be fair, he asked once and then left us alone after we declined. \n\nThe upside- the flavors were so delicious!  Also, prices for the main dishes were super reasonable.  My lobster dish had two tails, and was only $42!  Very much worth it.  Our server was polite, as were the waiters clearing our plates and filling our waters.  We fell in love with their pretzel bread, and they were kind enough to pack some to go so we could enjoy it later on our trip.  \n\nCertainly a good bet :)"

Just outstanding! \n\nWe just celebrated our anniversary here so we explored their new menu. They are always experimenting with something new based on our past experiences. We splurged and explored their new menu of which I've included some pictures. \n\nI'd say the best way to describe this place is they take a classic twist on comfort foods.

Considering the price and level of the restaurant, the service and speed leaves a lot to be desired. \n\nHold on, after convincing the waiter we deserved and expected to eat in under an hour, our order has finally arrived! Now about the food: Overall, very, very good. We started with the Caesar Salad which was excellent with a tangy Dijon/Caeser dressing. I had the \"slow cooked\" Salmon with a side of fries that I would definitely recommend. A note about the fries: The fries alone were very good, light and crispy. However they were served with plain old Heinz ketchup. Not a good move for a restaurant of this level. There seemed to be special sauces for pretty much everything, why leave out the fries? My wife had the Fillet Mignon. She had asked for it to be cooked medium well. After the waiter used the excuse that the order was taking a long time because the steak was ordered medium well, it showed up medium rare. Go figure... either way the steak was excellent as was the salt and pepper crusted baked potato. The steak came with a really interesting side sauce made from cilantro, mint, lemon grass and several other tasty ingredients. It was very good on the steak and I might add, really nice with my french fries. \n\nSo when we return to Vegas which we do regularly, would we also return to Jean Georges Steak House? Nope. Nice atmosphere, good food but the service just isn't worth the price. By the way, after the waiter used an innocent steak as an excuse for slow service I decided to head back to the kitchen myself to check on our order, and maybe see if they could use some help to speed things up. My wife had the rare urge to restrain me so kept me from hunting down our dinner. My bet is that if the level of service continues as it is, some one Else's husband or wife will seek to encourage rather than restrain."

What a great decision.  \n\nWe started off with a Burrata Mozzarella topped with tomato, basil, olive oil and a crostini.  When we received our order it had been split onto 2 plates.  This first course was so delicious, we ordered another round.  For the main course, I ordered the 18 oz ribeye and my wife the 10 oz filet.  Each steak was cooked perfectly to temp, mine mid rare and the wife's to medium.  The steaks were served with 4 dipping sauces to taste.  Each sauce was creative and unique, the soy miso butter and Bearnaise were my favorite.  We decided on the nightly special, truffle mashed potatoes and black truffle/comte fritters as our sides.  These sides were amazing!  The sides actually out performed the steaks.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from giving Jean Georges Steakhouse 5 stars is my personal preference for broiled steaks over wood-fired steaks which are served at Jean Georges.    I highly recommend Jean Georges Steakhouse."

The menu was pretty similar but they d\u00e9cor and atmosphere were very different. Oddly enough, the one in Scottsdale seems much more vibrant and fun. This one was a bit dark and stodgy. But maybe I just felt that way because it was pretty empty (we were there right when they opened at 5pm) and also our waitress was a bit stiff. It was fun to see the modern art interpretation of the cows face on the wall and udders over the bar.\n\nI was happy to see online that they had a pre-theater early bird special tasting menu for only $69 which included soup or salad, choice of 3 entrees, and a dessert. The waitress didn't offer this up as a choice so be sure to ask for that menu if you interested. She also kind of downplayed the value saying that it wouldn't be enough food unless you ordered additional sides anyway. In the end we decided to order off the regular menu. Hubby got a porterhouse with a Caesar salad as his starter and mashed potatoes as his side (everything is a la carte here). He absolutely loved his steak and potatoes but the Caesar was one of the worst we've ever seen. Hunks of lettuce, gobs of bland dressing and then parmesan shreds that looked like they had been grated hours if not days before. For $16 you would just expect better. That is a pretty high price for an appetizer sized salad. As for me, I started with the butternut squash soup and that did not disappoint. They do the bit where they bring you the bowl and then pour the soup in tableside. That seems to be a thing at high end restaurants nowadays. For my entr\u00e9e I ordered the short rib and let me tell you that definitely the best value on the menu. Even though it was only one rib, it had a decent amount of meat on it... probably 6 oz at least. And it was well seasoned with a caramelized sauce and a good char on the outside. Very delicious. And it came with some pieces of fried polenta that were delicious as well. Crispy on the outside and rich and creamy on the inside. I wish I would have realized that this would be so much food because I also ordered a side dish, the Brussels sprouts which I didn't really have room for. These were pretty bland and boring so no loss there, except the $12 I paid for them.\n\nAfter our meal we agreed that we didn't have any major complaints about the food (other than the high prices) but the service was a little intrusive. Our waitress kind of hovered over us. She also kept pressuring us to order more drinks. When we received the bill we were shocked to see that we were charged $4.50 for each diet coke my husband drank. I guess there are no refills, which I understand some restaurants do, but $4.50 for a small glass of fountain soda with no alcohol in it is just ridiculous. For this reason alone we will likely not return. I also saw that my wine was $18 a glass even though I am fairly certain that on the menu it was listed as $11 a glass (I ordered the Malbec). By this time we didn't have time to argue because needed to get to our show (we had tickets to see Zarkana). Also since it was our anniversary we didn't want to get into a negative confrontation with the waitress who seemed like a real odd bird anyway. I will say it was nice that she brought out a small dessert for free for our anniversary but it was not really welcome since we had already said that we were too full for dessert and in a hurry to go."

Who designs these floor plans. \n\nThe bar is circular with some great HD screen sports action, very few places serves this high quality of food with the game on. I had event in the private dinning room, it was very nice and we had great privacy and service. The shell fish platters were a hit. I like to order some of the off-menu items like the Tomahawk Steak, Chateaubriand and Asian Ginger Lobster. The jalapeno garlic  mushroom are Jean George V at his best. Mix the hot sauce and soy miso better sauce, its awesome.\n\nReggie does a great job with the wine as the som and will find some hidden gems. Mike and Darren are great at service at the bar with cocktails/menu and Gary also knows his wine and the menu cold.

Attitude AND 10 minutes to be seated? Give me a break.\n\nWe skipped appetizers and went straight for entrees. I got the NY Strip and the truffle fritters. The boy got filet minion and mashed potatoes. \n\nMy boyfriend loved his filet minion. He said it was one of the top five steaks he's had in his life. For him, it was cooked to perfection. Also, I think he was more in love with his mashed potatoes than me, if only during dinner. I kid, he loves me way more than mashed potatoes! I admit, they were great: creamy and not too salty. \n\nMy 16 ounce NY strip was a behemoth. I had it cooked medium and it was a great steak, but not top 5 for me. The truffle fritters were yummy, but a bit on the strong side. Then in a stroke of genius, I combined a piece of steak and a fritter and KABOOM. Perfection. Too bad I was going into a food coma at that point and only had about 3 bites left in me. \n\nWe were also given a plate of the 4 dipping sauces and the steak come with a salsa verde. It's on the minty side, which I enjoyed. Of the 4 sauces I liked the hot sauce best (it's yellow). \n\nNo dessert.

However, I did note that this is how they were seating everyone. Awkward times for everyone! \nThankfully we were close to the end of our meal when a party of 4 were seated near us. They were the 55 year old versions of Jersey Shore. Loud. Obnoxious. Not even funny! At least entertain me if you are going to be that annoying. \n\nEnding on a happy note, our waiter was the bomb! John? Jim? Jake? Jeff? Jared? Jacob?...Steve? I feel bad for not remembering but he was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, etc. The best service I've had in a while. He's what really saved the day and this rating."

It was decent and somewhat attentive, but for this type of an establishment, I would have expected a little more.  There were a few times where our water glasses stayed empty for a while, but w/e.\n\nWe started with the Tuna Tartare, which was the highlight of the evening.  Just a perfect blend of shitake mushrooms, tuna, turnip, and other stuff.  I wish it was served with something other than the \"unfinished\" eggroll wrapper for crackers, but it was still delicious.  Definately a must have.\n\nFor dinner, the wife and I shared the 26 oz Tomahawk steak (granted 8oz was just the bone) and the 8oz Australian lobster.  For the sides we had the Bone Marrow and the Sauteed spinach.  \n\nThe steak was really well cooked and the sauces they served with it were ok.  Of the 5 sauces, the habenero dill was my favorite.  The others weren't really worth mentioning.\n\nThe lobster is something I would steer clear of next time.  It was a little overcooked and rubbery, and the taste just didn't cut it.\n\nThe bone marrow was excellent, if you like gelatenous gooey goodness.  The parsley-lemon gremolta they serve with it was awesome, wish they gave more of it.\n\nSpinach was so-so.\n\nFor desert, we had the warm chocolate cake.  We proabably should have just passed on this, because it wasn't very good.  Kind of like a chocolate suffle but without the deliciousness of a suffle.\n\nAlso worth mentioning was the Cherry Yuzu soda.  This was so good, but at $8 per glass, you might want to take it slow.\n\nOverall the experience was great.  The bill ended up being ~$300 for everything, which isn't bad.  However, if I were in Vegas in the mood for steak, I would definately go to Craftsteak and have the Kobe Wagyu pre-fix.  Its about the same in price, but much better tasting food, with a greater variety.\n\nI think if it wasn't part of the Aria package, and technically free, I would probably be more upset at dining at Jean Georges."

Lettuce seemed a bit weak va crunchy crisp.  Dressing was unremarkable.  To be blunt, their salad was not even as good as Black Angus' and that's sad for a $15 salad. \n\nCalamari - unusual presentation with a little cup of dipping sauce way disproportionate to the amount of calamari received.  I appreciate receiving the sauce.  But the calamari was dare I say ... too strong a \"fishy taste\"?  I mean I've certainly had both frozen and fresh calamari, but this one the texture and taste was just a little off.  Tasted like a box of frozen bait squid was left to thaw, and they managed to fry it into something resembling calamari.  About $18?  I'd give them the eve for of the doubt on this one and just rack it up to chef's style of preparation.  \n\n18 oz bone in ribeye.  Steak was pretty good. But they served their house sauce in a cheesy looking plastic bone marrow looking serving container.  Either give real bone marrow as a treat. Or find something classier. \n\nDiver scallops - 4 out of 5.  No complaints. \n\nCreamed spinach - average.  Nothing to write home about\nTruffles mash potatoes - same comment as above. \n\nIf you want to taste something truly like truffles- and have a great steak.  I'd recommend SW steak at the Wynn and get their truffled corn.  Marginally more expensive, but a lot more memorable for the right reasons."

So 5 stars for service from me.\n\nThe non red meat food.... 4-5 stars\n\nStarted with Soup du Jour... escapes my memory what it was exactly but something with lobster. Lobster bisque has been en vogue for a while now but i remember actually enjoying this version.\n\nPeekytoe Crabcake... on the regular menu and very very good. All crab meat cake without much else. The grapefuit and ginger sauce went well with the crab while the avacado smoothed the overall texture.\n\nMaine Lobster... also off the regular menu. Almost like an Asian stir-fry. My wife very much enjoyed it and the brussel sprouts were done to perfection. Brussel sprouts not done correctly can kill a dish.\n\nThe beef... 3 stars\n\n24oz Porterhouse... ordered it medium rare. came out more on the rare side but i can enjoy some bloody meat so it was fine. But overall a bit chewy all around. The filet side was not overcooked but felt the quality of meat a bit frustrating for the supposed level of the steakhouse.\n\nIn Vegas, better can be had at Delmonico's or even Joe's Seafood at Caesar's Palace.\n\nQuite a letdown... only salvaged but its other offerings and service."

Their butternut squash soup was super yummy and their caesar salad is to die for. & Moving onto the main course....we had the grilled wagyu filet mignon and the NY strip. both were good but i'm not much of a steak fan so the sides we ordered were 100000x better. the broiled bone marrow ( sounds unappetizing, i know ) was amazing! along with their roasted brussel sprouts. We also got the creamed spinach, but I like the one at Lawry's better. =/ \n\nWe didn't try any of their desserts since Jean Phillipe's patisserie was right downstairs and i was dying to try their deserts....\n\nThe service was great, and the waiters were incredibly friendly and the atmosphere wasn't as stuffy as you'd imagine. OH and their pineapple mojitos. I noticed that their wine collection was pretty extensive, but the prices seemed to be a little higher than other places on the strip....which is understandable, it is Aria after all.\n\nThe overall ambiance was pretty mellow, the music seemed quite loud for an upscale restaurant but it seemed like a great date night place! :P\n\nBut all in all, it was just one of those places that I'd only visit once simply because there are so many steakhouses in vegas."

A room divider is comprised entirely of hundreds of encased wine bottles on display. The chef's table private room is expansive.\n\nMy warm spinach salad with lardons and chevre vinaigrette was tasty. So was the stellar bread basket. No exaggeration: the croustillante and moelleux from their baguette made me devour another basket of just that variety: perfect bread! Loved most the sourdough; great ratios.\n\nNext came my  12-oz NY strip, ordered medium. Done and prepped with a SW inspired dry rub, complemented with a salsa verde concocted sauce. Almost like a chimichurri. Asked for medium...cooked perfectly. But waay tougher than I had expected.\n\nGlasses of bubbly are reasonably priced.\n\nThe cheesecake with the sour cherry compote and cream inside of a tuille stole the entire show. A sucker for cheesecake, this plate was stunning, in presentation, form, and taste. Quite good.\n\nMy service was impeccable, save when i needed them in the end to get the bill.

We knew it would be pricey and expected the food to be delectable.  Both assumptions were proven to be accurate.\n\nDecor is posh.  Lots of abstract cow faces all about the room (once you arrive, you'll see what I mean).  Also enhancing the decor is the group of constant gawkers standing in front of the restaurant who look at the menu and gaze inside, hoping to see a celebrity or otherwise rich person.\n\nMy meal was fantastic.  An uncannily delicious Caesar salad started my evening.  Lemony, light, and topped with fresh, mouthwatering Romano.  Maybe my favorite Caesar of recent years.  The freebie breads were also tasty, adding a nice bit of peripheral value to the high prices of the dishes.  Next came the main course - 12 oz. filet, cooked rare-med rare, with creamed spinach and some shared asparagus.  The steak was lovely - seared on the outside, warm and red middle, flavorful and thoroughly enjoyable.  My 12 ouncer was more like a solid pound of filet, thus keeping the enjoyment alive for a few more savory minutes.  The sides were both excellently prepared, with the asparagus being a wonderful surprise.  Simultaneously, I enjoyed a Hitachino Nest White Ale, a beer I'd never before tried.  This added another bit of happiness to an already memorable meal.\n\nMy only \"Eh, Not so Sure About This\" at Jean-Georges was the service.  Our primary server was attentive as is to be expected at both a high-end steakhouse and at a restaurant with only 4 other customers present (we went early).  On the other hand, the server's assistants were quite clumsy and made several fumbles during our meal.  For example, one assistant acted as though the thought of a split check was the Grand Unified Theory of particle physics and I'm fairly sure a tear came to his eye when I asked that unforgivable inquiry.  Additionally, one assistant poured a colleague's bottled beverage into the cups of the other people at our table who weren't enjoying this beverage, effectively mixing two things that did not mix and wasting my colleague's investment.\n\nOn the whole, I provide a strong recommendation for this restaurant.  I suggest going around 6:30; that way you beat the rush but can enjoy the show.  Viva!"

The atmosphere is perfect for a romantic dinner. My husband enjoyed a beer, and I sipped on a delicious glass of moscato. \n\nWe enjoyed the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer, but we left the pear and horseradish sauce on the plate, it was a rough combination. The shrimp appetizer is 3 pieces for $24, and the waiter offered to add a fourth piece for $7 more, but we declined. Around the same time as the Appetizer, the waiter brought us an assortment of fresh breads; pretzels, raisin, sourdough, and a crisp cheese crusted flatbread. They were good, as any fresh hot bread should be. \n\nFor our entrees, my husband chose the crispy short rib with polenta fries, and the truffle mac n cheese for his side. The short rib and the glaze on it was melt in your mouth delicious, the meat was falling off the bone, so good. The truffle mac n cheese was awesome, the pasta was so tender, the sauce was creamy and perfect, and the crumbs on top gave it the perfect little crunch. Grown up mac and cheese at its finest.\n\nI ordered the crispy organic chicken with spinach, and the brussel sprouts for my side. Before my food arrived, i was expecting it to be a chicken breast half pan seared and roasted to make it crispy, what i was actually served was large whole chicken breast cooked to perfection, then coated and fried in a batter that sort of reminded me of a tempura batter, but better. The batter was light and did not stick to the chicken so i was able to enjoy both separately and together. It was not greasy or overly seasoned at all. The chicken was served on a bed of sauteed Spinach and a cheese sauce. It was deciduous putting all those flavors together. The side of Brussels were good, not amazing, it was about average of what you would find at other restaurants but appearance was beautiful. They were roasted and served with thick chucks of bacon and thin slices of pear(?). I wish the brussels had been roasted a bit longer so they had a bit more tenderness, still i enjoyed the dish anyway.\n\nWe asked for the dessert menu and instead were served a plate of their warm chocolate cake (chocolate lava) with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to share in celebration of our anniversary. It was a sweet gesture (no pun intended), and it was the desert my husband was planning to order, so he was in heaven. I am not a fan of chocolate cake, but it was good, maybe things taste better when they are free lol. The ice cream was amazing. Creamy and smooth, served on a be of sweet vanilla powder with a piece of caramelized sugar laid on top. It was the best ice cream ive had in a long time.\n\nPrice wise the meal came out to much less than we expected, having been to other steak houses I  the strip, i believe it was appropriate for the quality. I give this restaurant 4 stars for the service and food. But i was tempted to give less because of the photo service they provide in the restaurant. We had a photographer come to the table and take a few pictures. We reviewed the prints and selected two, expecting that they would be pricy, as in $40 range for the pictures. I almost choked when she came back with my receipt for $70. Definitely only something i would purchase on an occasion like this, but for that price?! Wow. We would never accept that again. It didn't ruin our night, just a bit of sticker shock before we headed over to the cosmo to enjoy the rest of our night."

It took an hour to get our drinks after sitting down and almost 4 hours to finish the entire meal.  Everyone was mad and rightly so.  The only reason I gave a one star rating was because the food is actually good - just too bad it takes all night to recieve it and a waitress full of attitude.  \n\nI would make somewhat of an excuse for the restaurant had it been very busy but the place was more than half empty.  Expensive food is great, but serve it to me in a proper time with a smile."

We started out with the appetizer that I can't spell with the beef carpacio  think is how you say it. Melt in your mouth truffle explosion of goodness! Followed by us splitting the 18oz bone in ribeye which was perfectly charred and came with 4 sauces on the side. A side of the mac and cheese which was to die for and then also a side order of the bone marrow. The marrow presentation was rustic and ow so savory. My wife was a little of put by the Fred Flintstone bone, but I really appreciated the look. Also we was new to eating marrow and the wait or actually set us up our first piece of brioche to show us how it's done! And finally for dessert they brought us out a comp molten cake and ice cream which delivered epic flavor. I recommend splitting the steaks above 16oz and you won't fill over stuffed afterwards and be able to enjoy your night rather then slipping into a blissful food coma! The service was top notch, I don't believe my ice tea or water went below half the entire night."

Hell No. \n\nJean George has made a name for itself nationwide for having best and highest quality of food. I guess when opening the Jean Georges steakhouse in Las Vegas, it became all about the decor and not the quality of the food.\n\nWhen you walk into Jean Georges, just by looking at the beautiful and extravagant decor, you know you're not walking into a budget friendly environment.  We chose this place because the Jean Georges in New York has amazing quality of food so we expected the same here.\n\nWe ordered the steak, it was pretty good. It just lacks that \"wowwwwwww\" factor. When it's a $$$$ type of restaurant, you're expecting to leave with that taste of satisfaction that the price of the meal isn't even relevant.\n\nThe service was impeccable. The waiter attended to us the entire night. With me being picky, we had a hard time picking the right bottle of wine, so we sampled and purchased many glasses of wine before picking the right one. And thanks to the expertise of our waiter,  we found the perfect bottle of wine for us.\n\nI personally wouldn't return here again, this is nothing like the other Jean Georges owned restaurants. It's all about decor, service and mediocre food here just like many of the other Las Vegas restaurants."

For us, this was the first because we had never been served any type of sauces in any high-end steakhouse.

The decor is dark but very clean and simple.\n\nWe started our meals off with a couple of appetizers.  We had the calamari and crab cake.  The calamari quantity is shareable but the crab cake was a single cake and wasn't really shareable.  One family member said the crab cake was excellent.  Calamari was very fresh and was excellent.  I can recommend the calamari.\n\nFor our main courses, one party member ordered the petite NY Strip.  She raved about how tender and flavorful it was.  Another ordered the rib eye.  She complained that it was tough.  I was shocked as this is supposedly the selling point of the restaurant.  Since the quantity was so large, she shared a piece with me.  I agreed, it was tough.  Both myself and another party member ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.  He loved his serving while I was so-so about mine.  My serving was a bit on the dry side which left it a bit tougher than I like it.  I guess I can let it slide since I did order seafood in a steakhouse.  Sides are a la carte.  They are traditional fare.  What disappointed me was that they did not offer any standard type steamed vegetables nor rice.  The only vegetables I remember were just creamed spinach and asparagus.  I ended up ordering the asparagus and the rest ordered a form of potato as a side.\n\nOverall, our experience was good but could've been improved upon.  Table side, service was excellent but the hostess service is definitely lacking in etiquette.  A young woman in a tight black dress doesn't constitute a proper hostess.  I'd rate my overall experience a 3 but I'm sure my family would give it a 5.  So the 4 rating is our average experience."

Reminds me of the shrimp chips at the asian markets. Our medium rare steaks were cooked to perfection and seasoned well. They were also very juicy and tender. They give you 4 sauces to pair with your steak. Omg the wagyu filet was very tasty and tender !! Very well executed! Perfect with a glass of wine ! The steaks do not come with sides. The sides are enough to be shared among 2-3 people. For sides we ordered Lobster Mash potatoes and Black Truffle Mac & Cheese. The lobster mash potatoes kinda looks like baby food but don't let that stop you from this yummy dish. Very rich lobster flavor and a good amount of lobster bits. The Black truffle Mac & cheese was very tasty one of the best I've had!\n\nOverall I had an amazing experience here. I liked the atmosphere. The food was soo good. The service was good as well. Our waiter explained everything in detail and was helpful with recommendations and always checked up on us. It's nice that the manager graciously came by to check up on our table.

It felt like we had a team of servers, as we interacted with many different people. \n\nWe went with the five course tasting menu with wine pairing. Each course was beautifully and artistically arranged. I wanted to take pictures, but it just didn't seem appropriate! It was often too pretty to eat! \n\nThe first course was Caviar served in a lemon and on a bed of a lemon jelly. It was delicious. The second course was tomato based. I can't remember exactly what was on it, but it was very good. The third was scallops- my favorite course! I can't recall the fourth course, but the final was an amazing cut of steak. We added the truffle mashed potatoes, which are a must-do! For dessert, we had a chocolate mouse. Everything was outstanding.\n\nA piece of advice- If you do the wine pairing (and you should) skip having a pre-dinner drink. I actually got fairly drunk and couldn't finish or properly enjoy my meal. It's a big undertaking, go in on an empty stomach!\n\nAlso, be prepared to spend more on pictures. They had a photographer going around to the tables and our pictures were so good, that we bought all of them. We spent about 150.00 on the pictures alone. They were great though!\n\nJean George Steakhouse is a decadent meal. The food is upscale, but the vibe is relaxed. I'm glad that we went here, but it isn't a good pick for a \"romantic\" restaurant, which is what I was hoping for on my wedding weekend. It's loud and busting. Fun and vibrant. But alas, not romantic!"

They have a great bar area with a nice view... We were taken to our table where our server Brad took very good care of us.. \nAs for food, I had my signature bone in ribeye and Brad did ask the chef to cook it the right way... I was surprised that it was charred on one side only... Chef, next time you owe me both sides, maybe he was worried on not getting it \"rare\", anyways, the steak was great, very good flavor and the right amount of fat for the ribeye...\nWe also had the bone marrow...  \"Flinstone\" type of bone in your table... For my taste, chef, you should send it with some thick salt on top, it will give it this extra kick... The toast you sent is maybe too thick for such a delicate taste, maybe go to the drawing board on that one... \nBrussel sprouts were nice and crisp... My partner had the petite fillet with the foi gras on top... He was very much pleased by flavor and tase, so again, high five there... \nWe also had a couple of bottles of Darioush, I would hope this place would keep wine at the correct temp... They were both over the serving standard.... Glasses were fine...\nThe place was clean.\nI have to say that I was a little reluctant at the time for the reviews I read, but at the end, I was impressed..\nEnjoy"

We ordered a lot of food for the four of us in order to try a little of everything. The serving sizes are small which our server warned us off. Food was good, not great. The service was the worst part. Dirty appetizer dishes sat on our table for 15 minutes. Empty wine glasses we would have filled on our own but are bottle was not left anywhere near our table, standard for a nice restaurant if someone is refilling! Bottom line is food isn't good enough to overlook bad service."

The sommelier recommended an excellent wine for our meal that hit the mark on every level. \nWe had the silky and sensuous tuna tartare and the buratta for apps & they were wonderful. The levels of flavor in the tuna tartare were tremendous.  It came with a delicate rice paper chip of sorts that was crispy and dissolved almost instantly once it hit my tongue - pretty neat and well paired with the tuna. \nWe both had the aged NY Strip (Waygu beef I think) and it was delicious, well seasoned & probably the best steak I've ever had. The sauces that accompanied the steaks were wonderful and I had a hard time selecting a favorite.  They were all delicious.\nThe sleek cast iron plates and dishes were really interesting and made the steak look like a piece of art when it was presented. Very dramatic. The Lalique knives were beautiful and well balanced, I was very impressed with them. \nWe wrapped up the meal with the decadent molten lava cake and ice cream, which was out of this world.  I have his cookbook and have made the cakes myself, but obviously his were better!\nI feel lucky to have had such a memorable and delicious dinner here and I truly look forward to returning here again.

The seabass was perfectly cooked, but the seasoning was awful!!   The lamb was full of fat.  They give you 3 chops.  Left half of order just from fat and bones.  And made the mistake of ordering the miso sauce.... more salt.  Then made the mistake of ordering a baked potato... rubbed with more salt! ugh!!  While waiting for the meal, they give an assorted basket of bread... one which is pretzel bread... more salt.  Did not enjoy my server in training.  Didn't tell us about everything on the menu.

Now let me say that the food was really really awesomely good.  All 6 of us loved the appetizers, entrees and sides.  The service left something to be desired.  Our waiter and sommelier were great but the lag time between appetizers and entrees was over an HOUR.  The excuse we were given was that there was a wedding party that were served in front of us.  That is not an excuse for the kitchen to be slow in my opinion.  You are a high end restaurant, charging high end prices and we had a reservation.  You can't cook for two parties at once?  So after complaining to the manager, they were very nice and comped our bottle of wine and all cocktails consumed.  Which, my friends, was a pretty penny.  Now on to the delicious deets.\n\nAppetizers-Crab cake and bacon wrapped shrimp.  One of the girls said this was the best crab cake EVER and practically licked the bowl.  I thought it was really good.  It's definitely not your typical crab cake.  The cake was all crab and it had a gingery broth underneath.  Very Nice.  Bacon wrapped shrimp was \"da bomb\" according to the men and it was very well cooked.  The bacon was crisp and shrimp not overdone.   Two in our party got the cobb salad and said it was excellent as well.\n\nEntrees-Two of us had the rib-eye, which was super good and fatty.  My husband got the filet, which came out overcooked, but the new one was out within 3 minutes.  One got the veal, one got the sea bass (not a beef eater), and one got the special NY strip.  Each steak came with a chimichurri sauce, but they also served 4 sauces on the side with the entrees and the habanero sauce was super spicy but so goooood.  The sides we ordered were asparagus, sauted mushrooms and artichokes, creamed corn and mashed potatoes.  Everything was cooked perfectly and yummy yummy.  \n\nNo time for desert!  :(  We were already late due to the slow service.  Definitely someplace I'd eat again."

My first thought was that it was very dark, as most high end restaurants are, your eyes adjust quickly.\n\nAppetizers: A variety if bread was brought out quickly which I liked. We started with a crispy sushi sampler with chipotle mayonnaise and tempura calamari. The sampler came with 6 pieces of nigiri, 2 salmon, 2 tuna, and 2 hamachi, with crispy rice. The calamari was easily in my top 3 favorite calamari I've ever had, it was fried perfectly, light and crispy. The whipped chili sauce was by far the best calamari sauce I've ever had. \n\nEntree: we decided to split a 8 oz. Filet mignon, which was cooked very well, peppered and crispy on the outside yet pinkish on the inside. Four separate dipping sauces were brought out with the filet homemade hot sauce, soy-miso butter, b\u00e9arnaise, and JG steak sauce, my favorite being the b\u00e9arnaise. 4 oz. was actually a good size, but my girlfriend not finishing her own gave me another 2. With the filet we got a lobster mashed potatoes which were fabulous, small bites of lobster with creamy mashed potatoes. \n\nDesert: We were actually too full to order desert, so we passed, but the people next to us ordered the honey crisp apple pie with bourbon ice cream and boy did it look good. We did get some coffee as dessert I guess.\n\nOver I really liked this place, good service and great food, would recommend to anyone!!"

            "review": "The girlfriend and I chose Jean Georges Steakhouse for dinner for our first day in Vegas.  We arrived about 10 minutes early for our 7:45 reservations.  The hostess informed us that our table would be available at our reservation time, but we could wait in the bar.  So we did, but decided against ordering any pre-dinner drinks.  Less than five minutes after our reservation time rolled around, the hostess tracked us down and led us to our table.  After a quick review of the menu, we opted for the Signature Tasting Menu with wine pairing. \n\nOur first course, Almas Ara Caviar over a Meyer Lemon Gelee with cr\u00e8me fraiche, and dill and served in a hollowed out lemon half, arrived at the table. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ It was beautifully presented.  More importantly, the contrasting tastes and aromatics of this successfully executed dish really kicked the meal off on an impressive note.  Unfortunately, our paired wine didn't arrive with the food, instead being delivered by our server halfway through our first course with basically no introduction beyond the appellation and varietal.  Our second course, Bacon Wrapped Shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro was well executed and nicely presented as well, but the dish wasn't all that original in concept and didn't provide the \"wow\" of the first course.  Sadly, like our first course, our paired wine again didn't arrive with the food and again it arrived without much of an explanation mid-course by a different server than the first.  The third course, a roasted Chilean Sea Bass topped with grilled Maitake mushrooms and a miso-yuzu glaze, sounded outstanding in its description, but was the night's biggest miss. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#GetRHNqeg8V60PcU-iEc0w The fish was cooked perfectly, but its topping was excruciatingly salty to the point of being inedible.  It was so salty that even after scraping it off of the fish, it was still salty to point that it overwhelmed the delicately flavored sea bass.   At least by this course, the wine arrived with the food (delivered by the second server), as was the case with subsequent courses.  Our fourth course, the grilled Wagyu Filet Mignon with grainy mustard and warm potato salad in textures, was a great rebound as our steaks were dead-on perfect medium rare, tender and flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#Uy27bZHUGqAet7HnHcT-pw  It was paired with the best wine of the night, a Cote du Rhone.  This course was the best marriage of food and wine of the night!  Our dessert course was the JG Candy Bar, which I can only describe as six deconstructed candy bars kluged together like a sweet, rich Frankenstein's monster. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#SmNL9RpX6i_VDuiZDsb_SA  It was paired with a Madera.\n\nWhile the food was, for the most part, well executed, and the wine was generally enjoyable, the service side of the house seemed awkward and lacking the depth of knowledge one would expect from a fine dining establishment like this one.  The gf and I aren't really wine snobs, but we do enjoy wine with our food.  If we enjoy a particular wine that we're served in a restaurant, we often will seek it out and buy it to enjoy at home.  Therefore, it was a huge foul that the service staff wasn't more familiar with the wine that was being paired with the food since we really enjoyed the Cote du Rhone served with the filet.  In the end, I felt the Tasting Menu especially with the wine pairings was a poor value.  While we certainly never felt rushed, I got the distinct impression that Jean Georges Steakhouse was more concerned with getting diners in and out rather than providing a truly memorable dining experience.  What a shame."

Foul! \n\nOh yeah then there's the pictures guy, really? Who the hell is this gypsy selling pictures and trying to up sell you pictures when you are trying to enjoy a great dish...

The scallops were tasty, but slightly salty for our tastes... lime wedges are a must to cut down their intensity.  The filet mignon main course was mixed-bag: the sesame seed sauce was delicious, but the meat was over-seasoned, extremely salty.  In addition, the chef-de-cuisine's choice of ending the menu with a classic lava cake was disappointingly dull.  It lacked any of the NY restaurant's Iuzzini's flair.  Overall, I had a better than average meal.\n\nService-wise, the restaurant falters, hindered mostly by a robotic waiter who just recited the course and a pair of hostile front hostesses who were unable to soldier a smile or pretend to be happy to see us even though the restaurant was nearly empty during dinner hours.  I suspect the qualification to work here is to hate all life and happy things, especially puppies.\n\nIf you are in the area with a steak crave, I'd recommend Gallagher's over at New York, New York.  If you want a tasting menu, Joel Robuchon's 4-course or 6-course meal is a far superior experience."

This is a restaurant in serious need of training from the top down. The top here may or may not be Jean Georges, but there is some serious attitude training needed. The obvious aim was to be pretentious, which is never a good thing. But if you're going to be pretentious, then you'd better be able to back it up with stellar service. They didn't and couldn't. First the food.\n\nThe steak was so-so. My dining partner and I were going to split the small rib-eye, which was listed as an 18 oz. portion of prime beef. It came to the table a little small for its purported weight, which wasn't the problem. It was an OK rib-eye, but lacked flavor for a $45+ piece of steak. We also had a Caesar salad, which was good, but not great. Nice preparation with delicious anchovies on top. Couldn't fault that. We also ordered some Brussels sprouts, which were nice and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. It came with walnuts and avocado, an unusual preparation, but delicious. \n\nThe wine list was inaccurate as well. A shiraz from Barossa (I'd been to the winery) was listed as being from New Zealand! About 3,000 miles away from South Australia and Barossa. It was kind of, but not very, cool that the wine list came on an iPad, but they would have been better served by using paper. I understand the concept, but not the execution.\n \nNo. While the food and wine was OK, even if way overpriced, the waitstaff and manager were the problem. And the problem was huge. First the waiter. There are ways a waiter can suss out what kind of knowledge the diner has about a product being presented. In this case, since I owned a restaurant once, I was very knowledgeable about beef. The waiter approached us as noobs who knew nothing. The meal came all divided up, but not well. The dishes were cleared away in such a manner that it appeared that they couldn't wait for us to leave. Plates and utensils were snapped up. As we finished our meal, the bus person came by and started clearing the table with a lot of clanking and jerked the place mat from under a drinking glass like a magician. It made a loud noise and seemed very rude. He ignored us when I told him to stop. Then I was angry.\n\nThe manager came by and asked if there was a problem, then proceeded to be a automaton, \"Yes sir.\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Yes sir.\" without hearing a word I said. Of course this was even more upsetting and condescending to us as diners who were paying a great deal of money for a mediocre meal. This man as a manager is in serious need of training or another profession.\n\nAt the end of the day, we left a very small tip. The waiter was OK. The manager was not. The only thing he did well was come to the table.\n\nIf you want a really good steak and good service that doesn't condescend, go across the street to Smith & Wollensky. Don't let your shadow fall on this place. I realize that this little diatribe won't make much difference because Jean Georges is located in the Aria hotel, so they get a huge captive audience, but I will be in Vegas again and I will go somewhere else. STAY AWAY from Jean Georges!"

From the outside looking in, I was somewhat impressed.  The host/hostess at the front desk didn't seem too thrilled to be working there.  We got seated and I must say, it was pretty dark in there.  Our party ordered a mix of things from black truffle mac and cheese, foie gras, creamed kale, bone in rib eye, to the filet mignon.\nblack truffle mac and cheese - I've had better out of a box\nfoie gras - was very good\ncreamed kale - way too creamy, couldn't taste the kale\nbone in rib eye - asked for it medium rare, it came out medium.  the steak wasn't seared, but more like burnt.  Couldn't really tell because the dining area was so dark, but my movement showed otherwise.\nfilet mignon - surprisingly tasted really good after trying the bone in.  \n\nWould I go back?  Not likely."

Hostess was gracious, waitress was nice, manager came to say hi when we sat down, bus boys switched plates, refilled water fast. it was great.\n\n1st: their wine list is amazing. all the great steak wines were there and for very decent prices. even their whites and dessert wine's are GREAT. very very few restaurants have the Chateau d'Yquem.\n\nmore importantly, their steaks were very very nicely done. At least their bone-in dry-aged ribeye done rare plus was just perfection. and their bone marrow was probably one of the best i've ever had. calamari was good, crab fritters were only OK.  \n\ni've live in NYC and have eaten my way across all the steakhouses, del frisco's being one of my favorites for ribeye.  This place, at least the night I ate here, beat them all."

The room alone set a very classy and elegant mood. It was dimly lit for a more intimate scene, and everything was clean and looked so modern. \n\nNow onto the food. I ordered the 8oz. Filet MIgnon and couldn't even finish it! Granted, we did order a buttload of sides, but the steak was cooked just to perfection and served with a tantalizing green sauce (I wish I remembered what was in it!). For sides, we ordered a bunch so all 11 of us could share. We got french fries (came with lots of dipping sauces), truffle mashed potatoes, steamed asparagus, and a shitake and artichoke side. The truffle mashed potatoes was hands down my favorite side dish, they were absolutely to die for!!\n\nLike many upscale restaurants in Vegas, it's definitely a pricey restaurant, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny!!"

Everything was delicious and service was pretty good although they didn't do a great job taking away our finished dishes. \n\nThe restaurant also has someone taking photographs of the patrons and offering printed photos for purchase. It's a nice (although overpriced) way to capture the moment since it's way too dark to take decent photos with a p&s camera flash. \n\nOverall if you're staying at Aria I'd recommend the place but not sure I'd go out of my way to come back."
