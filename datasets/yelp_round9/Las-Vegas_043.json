My filet was good. My husband's huge ribeye left much to be desired. I felt like they burnt the outside of his steak making it taste \"chared.\" Not so good considering the price! We've been to DelMonico's before - and we much prefer Delmonicos!"

            "review": "Took advantage of the Restaurant Week special with a few buddies. Very nice upscale place on the strip located in the Palazzo. If you get a seat outside and you're lucky enough you can watch the Treasure Island show. Or if you're unlucky enough stay there during a show, all a matter of perspective.\n\nSo the meal which was priced at 50.12\n\nOnion Soup Gratinee\n - Overall this was the best fancy named french onion soup i've had. It was rich and...soupy...it was good. Normally i don't order french onion soup or onion soup but this was good. \n\nBaby Iceberg Lettuce\n - Pretty much a wedge salad with three wedges. Bacon cuts were nice and thick and wonderfully smoked but the blue cheese dressing was way too rich and plentiful.\n\nMediterranean Branzino\n - I did enjoy the sides the came with this Mediterranean SEABASS but for the fish itself...yeah i forgot what seabass tasted like. Way too buttery as well.\n\nProfiteroles \n - enough with the fancy names...These are little puff pastries filled with vanilla ice cream and includes chocolate sauce. At this point of the dinner all of us were way too stuffed to even consider dessert but it came out anyway. I enjoyed the ice cream more then the pastry due to my need to live to eat another day.\n\n\nMorels relies on the older French ideology of cooking which heavily relies on rich and heavy sauces to enhance food. Totally different and may be a bit heavy on you if you're more used to lighter aromatic dishes of today's modern dining experiences."

The food was great (had the pork chop which was very nicely done). The coffee was served and made via French press which I'm addicted to to start with and that in of itself put a great touch on the experience."

            "review": "We came here with a big party based on their previous experiences at this place. In the past they had said they received excellent service. This visit was not the case. The waiters were unfriendly and robotic. We were the only people out on the patio and it was the perfect night for it. This right off the bat told us something about this place. Since there are not many good restaurants that you can sit outside at and the fact that it was empty was not good. The wine selection was good and my husband and I ordered a Red Zin. It took about 30 minutes for our table to receive our drinks. We both were happy with our drink choice. The rest of the evening was spent ordering as much as we could ahead of time since our waiter would take forever to get our orders out to us. As far as the food goes, we ordered appetizers and were given no recommendations. We had 12 people at our table and an appetizer was enough for 2 people. It would have been helpful if they had suggested we order multiple for the table or just given any sort of direction. The appetizers were very bland.(tuna tartar, crab salad, shrimp scampi). My husband ordered the filet mignon and the order came out incorrectly. It was under cooked and they forgot the sauce that was supposed to be on top. Since everything took forever to come out he had to wait additional time to eat his food. The sides that came with the steak were underwhelming as well. They were also very small, about 5 pieces of asparagus for the whole table, again some direction would have been nice! The french fries were dry. I did like the mushrooms.  I ordered the Salmon which I typically would not at a steakhouse since it's risky. The Salmon was cooked perfectly but everything about the dish lacked flavor. I found the entire experience very disappointing."

            "review": "It just did not impress at all. For $140 bill for two I expected much better from a French restaurant. \n\nThe place was nearly empty on Sunday at 9pm. This should have meant better, more consistently attentive service, but no. It took a good 5 minutes for our server to show up with the menus. Take queue from Denny's and have the hostess give the menus to the clients - it works! Our server was ok, but I felt she did the bare minimum in checking on us and being friendly. \n\nAfter a little while the attentiveness improved by the assistant waiter who would refill our beverages on time and without us asking. \n\nNow on to the food. It was OK. Not bad but not great either. We had mussels and the halibut, and did not find either to be anything special or with some unique twist that would leave a lasting impression. The potato dauphinois side lacked seasoning, and was underwhelming.  The $37 dozen of oysters was fresh and delicious. \n\nWith so many restaurants in Vegas, having a restaurant with many mediocrities is a sure way for another more 'hungry' competitor to take over and wow the patrons.  Unfortunately for Morels, it needs improvement in consistency across many departments to stave off the hungry competitors. Otherwise we are sure to see some new eatery open in its place soon."

Three people at my table ordered steaks and all three were horrible cuts.  The only saving grace was that they were well prepared.  \nI thoroughly enjoyed the lobster tail appetizer.  That was the best starter I've ever had."

            "review": "Came here for Three Square Restaurant Week lunch menu on Aug 31, 2011.  Soup of the day was butternut squash soup, it was more black pepper than butternut squash, but texture was good.  The server took it away before I could finish all of it.  The salad was large and dressing was excellent.  The crispy salmon was excellent as the salmon was perfectly cooked with a very light, yet crispy skin.  The salmon was served on a bed of lentils, carrots, and mushrooms, very tasty.  The steak frite was asked to be cooked medium rare, but it came out more medium well on the thin side, and medium on the thicker side.  It was very tender though.  The french fries are excellent!  Light and crispy, my dad couldn't stop eating them.  The strawberry ice cream for dessert was the most flavorful strawberry ice cream I have every had with a wonderful whip cream.  \n\nWe got there early right before 12 noon and it was pretty empty, the service started out a little slow as we had to wait a couple minutes for the menus and water.  Otherwise, the rest of service was excellent, staff was friendly and prompt.  \n\nI would not normally eat here as it is located on the strip, but for Restaurant week, I wanted to give it a try.  I am glad I did."

We had to wait 15 minutes just for 2 for drinks! Medium Rare does not mean raw. We should have sent this back but were in a hurry to get to a show. No wonder there was no wait at 9pm on a Saturday night. There's just way to many places to go that are better quality. They did a fun table-side salad presentation. That was probably the highlight of the meal sadly. Go to Cut instead. It's only a few steps away. This place needs some work.\n\nP.S. I don't get the French or the Bistro?!"

The asparagus came with cheese on top.  They apologized, after letting me know that in the order it came with dairy alergy and still was served with cheese and of course the manager said: someone could have been die... I'm sorry...\n\nBe aware. We are not going to eat here again!"

Instead of our usual Bloody Mary's, I opted for the pot of Kenyan coffee and it was delicious! At Dion's suggestion, we started with the mussels which were, of course, great! Then, it was back to our croque monsieur and crab eggs benedict because we love them so much (the regular eggs benedict is pretty great too though!). Morels, I still can't believe you do brunch so well, EVERY TIME! :)"

            "review": "Our group of 10 dined at Morels in August of 2014. We make a trip to Las Vegas every summer and typically eat at one fine dining restaurant a visit. I personally go to Las Vegas at least twice a year and try to average 1 - 2 fine dining meals a trip. Earlier this trip my fiancee and I ate at Barrymore and we both felt that the meal at Morels was significantly better.\n\nThe reasons our group enjoyed our meal at Morels:\nService: I was the last of the group to arrive, so I do not know how the host / hostess did with the initial greeting. I do know that our party was seated promptly and professionally. Our waiter (Jake, I think) did an excellent job of answering menu questions and making recommendations. We had one vegetarian in the group and the chef made her a special pasta dish that was not on the menu. The support staff, sommelier and management were all extremely friendly and attentive.\n\nFood: The food was OUTSTANDING. We had 2 meat and cheese plates to start things off and they set the tone for the rest of the evening. Our group ordered oysters in the half shell (they had 4 varieties that evening) and those of us that ate them enjoyed them. Morels offers a Caesar salad for 2 that is prepared tableside and it is delicious. 80% of the group ordered steak, breaking down to 6 filets and 1 porterhouse that was split by 2 folks. I was one of the guys enjoying the porterhouse and it was fantastic. All steaks were cooked to proper temperature. In terms of side dishes, I had tastes of the asparagus, mac n' cheese and french fries. I felt the mac n' cheese was very good and the other 2 sides were solid. The french fries are skinny cut, not thick steak fries. We also ordered a few desserts, my personal favorite were the doughnuts with jam. The overall quality of the food was excellent.\n\nAtmosphere: Our reservation was for 8pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant was not very crowded when we arrived, and the atmosphere was comfortable and enjoyable. There was one other large party at the restaurant when we were seated and their presence did not affect our service or enjoyment of the dining area. After our meal, we went out on the balcony, which overlooks The Strip, and enjoyed a few after dinner drinks. By the time we left, the dining room was significantly busier but not too loud. \n\nLike any good steak restaurant, your meal will not be inexpensive. The question is: Do you feel like you got your money's worth at the end of the evening? Our group's response to this question is an overwhelming \"YES!\". I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant and plan on going back in October."

            "review": "My husband and I tried the $45 four course tasting menu. It started off with the cheese plate which was unmemorable. Followed by A chilled shrimp...literally one shrimp (altho a larger shrimp). The cocktail sauce was so bland. I had the watermelon arugula salad. The watermelon was flavorful but the salad and dressing were extremely bland and needed a lot of salt. The sirloin was just okay, nothing to write home about. The halibut was okay too but I question the freshness of the fish because it left a weird tingle in my tongue which I've heard happens when fish is not fresh. \n\nThe WORST part of the dining experience was that I ordered the cheeseburgers for my son off of the kids menu. The meat came out borderline raw. My son actually ate some of it and only have s few bites I noticed how undercooked the meat was. I should have take a photo as proof. I was so angry and so flabbergasted that they would serve such underdone meat to a child. I showed the waiter and by his reaction he was shocked as well. I sent the food back and they brought out more well cooked burgers.\n\nThe service was this place is awful. It's so slow. I was there on a Saturday night and it wasn't event that full and yet the service was extremely slow. We sat on the patio and I felt like we were being ignored because I barely saw our waiter."

Than they forgot about us.

We were in Las Vegas for a weekend and wanted to have French food but didn't have the time or money for a really fine dinner so we opted for brunch. We debated between Bouchon and Morels but finally decided on Morels because they make Eggs Benedict, Bouchon doesn't. \n\nThere were four of us plus a little one. We sat at a beautiful round table and were treated like royalty from minute one by a friendly staff. They were complete professionals, keeping the table clean and stocked. First they brought us fresh beignets that were light and not overly sweet. We ordered French press coffee -- which was incredible and not the least bit gritty like the kind I make at home, espresso, a \"virgin\" latte for the kid, and handmade Bloody Marys. Oh boy, are these a treat! Seriously, these ALONE are worth a trip.\n\nThey bring out a cart full of fixings. Their own homemade tomato juice, hand grated horseradish, fresh chopped garlic, limes for squeezing, etc. Marcos, our waiter, talked us through the entire process of making the drink and graciously allowed three of us to copiously snap his picture. It was fun! The Bloody Mary was incredible. At $14, I don't know how they break even! I could have had three more. Yum, yum, yum.\n\nNext, we ordered breakfast: Steak and eggs (with frites), a crab omelet (came with brioche), Eggs Benedict with crab, and French Dip -- mine. I thought the sandwich was delicious. Great bread, delicious sauce, perfect touch of cheese, tender meat. The frites were fantastic -- I tried them but got a salad instead. I heard rave reviews on the crab, very tasty and tender, and tried the omelet. It was amazing. So was the bread. Everything was delicious.\n\nOverall, incredible time. Relaxed but our every need was attended to. We lingered and felt no pressure to go. Our bill came quickly when we wanted it. The timing on everything was perfect. Only one thing -- my guy's hashbrowns were not hot. He's big on HEAT. Marcos took them off his plate -- so he could still eat the omelet -- and got new ones made. Problem solved!"

It was really fun watching them make it.\n\nI also tried a bite of the Eggs Norwegian (Saut\u00e9ed Spinach, Poached Eggs, Toasted Brioche, Hollandaise, Smoked Salmon) which was delightful and surprisingly not that heavy.  I really liked the use of brioche because it was nice and buttery!\n\nOverall, a nice spot to chill with your friends with mimosas or handcrafted bloody marys!  (The artwork inside is racy, sexy and surprising)."

Beautiful ambience, easy to access at front of casino and most importantly excellent food. By excellent I mean there was nothing served that wasn't excellent. I tried a bourbon play on a mojito with blackberry. Well done. Next their beet salad with fried cheese balls. Amazing salad. I LOVE beets and I really love the texture of fried quality cheese in a refined salad. It's been years since I've stumbled on a salad with it so this really worked for me.\n\nNext I decided not to order a steak (it takes a LOT for a steak to impress me) and I was enjoying my experience too much to take the risk. So I ordered the braised short rib. Lets just say I was happy with my choice. Very well cooked, served with 3 different kinds of salts I can't pronounce and covered in onion and wine sauce and served over pur\u00e9e of pommes. Incredibly satisfying. I cleaned my plate.\n\nI should also probably mention that the service was perfect. No fewer than 2 managers and 3 waiters checked on the quality of our experience. Honestly for $200 total (including drinks and appetizers for two) it was true value for the money and a must go for foodies who don't mind spending a bit every once in a while."

The meat is made in-house as opposed to that salty-cold-cut-meat kind of deal.  They also give you complimentary beignets."

But even for a medium well NY Steak this was exrtremely tough meat for something that's supposed to be \"Prime.\"  I've had better steaks from Sizzler and that's no exaggeration.  Whatever you do don't order the NY.

All the food was prepared perfectly, yet none of it stood out as unique in my mind.  I suppose this went along with the decor... upscale yet modest, nothing too flashy.  \n\nAlthough nothing at all was wrong with my visit here, I just wasn't wowed like I have been at some other amazing vegas restaurants.

The fondue is superb and very reasonably priced. We splurged for seared fois gras and it was on par with the best we've had in Paris. The outdoor patio is breezy and has a fantastic view of the Strip. On top of great food and views, the service was the best we've ever experienced and we have had our fair share of top-priced dinners. The sommelier Alex B. was particularly fantastic both providing some fantastic pairings and going above and beyond actually repairing my better half's recently cracked souvenir glass with super glue (yes, I'm serious). Really above and beyond experience and I'm hoping they expand Morels to Miami soon."

Walking through the Venetian and Palazzo we became very antsy to settle down somewhere as just about every place didn't fit the bill for our brunch cravings. Call it frustration but we ended up settling at Morels and knew that we had made a good decision once our waiter showed up. An older gentleman, he was very entertaining and started joking with us on the spot. We ordered up mimosas and a Bloody Mary that was made on a cart right in front of our table.\n\nFor my meal, I went for the Crab Oscar Benedict that lacked a bit of a special kick but I managed to finish every last bite. My friends enjoyed their steak and eggs and turkey club served alongside pommes frites. While it was probably more of an elaborate meal than we needed, it was quite funny to look back on. \n\nI'm sure this place is a bit more crowded at night time when the ambiance provides a elegant backdrop to a night out in Vegas. But I'm almost happy when that we came at a less popular time so that we could take in our waiter's company and cause a bit of a scene without being judged."

The bernaise was horrible - there was one flake of tarrigon in the cold oniony goo.  And I guess there must be more than one person dining at a table to be served bread - which the people literally sitting right next to me - let me know that it was really good... I guess I'll take their word for it.\n\nSo... One cocktail, one glass of house cab, one small filet, one baked potato plain, one serving of bernaise = an even $100.00.\n\nDo not waste your money here.

Some of the highlights were the Chef's Prime Beef Tenderloin Tartar and the Roasted Branzino. I love quail eggs and paired with the truffle chips the beef just popped with flavor.  The Branzino was cooked perfectly. It was moist and had multiple layers of flavor with the skin intact. Of course the oysters and cheese selection is second to none. Both were great again and I would go back for that alone. \n\nOur service was much improved and again it felt like a completely different experience than before. I love to see a place take our experiences and reviews seriously. If more restaurants took the lead like the new general manager they would truly start to understand their customers.

And not just by a little bit, by a rather large margin.I love steak and I love French so this should have been a match made in heaven, perhaps how much I looked forward to going here tainted my view but it was so bad it can't all have been my bias. Just look at my review record- I have enver given 1 star to anything else- I am a pretty soft judge\n\n\nFirst- my reception.\n\nI had just spent an inordinate amount of time playing poker at the Venetian. As such I was not dressed super formally- khaki shorts, polo shirt, tennis shoes- more than acceptable for vegas lunch. This is on a Weds about 230pm. The host ( a dude) ignores me for about 5 minutes while he is on the phone than finally, reluctantly, brings me to a table. It is then about 20 minutes before I see my waiter. During this wait I am drinking some water and happen to empty my glass. The water guy comes up and starts pouring the water before the pitcher is over the glass and misses the glass for a solid 3 seconds soaking the entire table and myself before he notices. I ask to move to a dry table. He tells me \"maybe\". At this point I look around, I am one of 6 people in the entire place. Eventually I get moved.\n\nMy Order\nI try to get the exact same thing my first time at every steak house here for comparison- bone in ribeye, potato side, tartare. The waiter comes up to my table and I try and get my order in as quickly as possible since I have already been waiting. \n\nme: \"Tenderloin Tartare, Bone in ribeye medium rare, potato dauphinois\"\nhim: would you like to hear about our specials\nme: no\nhim: well then what would you like\nme: Tenderloin Tartare, Bone in ribeye medium rare, potato dauphinois\nhim: im not sure we have that\nme: which part\nhim: uh... the potato\n\nit only went downhill from there. He didn't write anything down, came back twice to ask to clarify, and then brought tuna tartare. The tuna was actually the highlight of the day.\n\nThe Steak\nI like steam rare to medium rare. That being said, I will eat just about anything. The steak that was brought to me was not even grey, it was so dark grey throughout I doubted if it was actual meat. It looked like an overcooked mcdonalds hamburger inside. I first cut a piece off the end and decided to give them the benefit of the doubt- maybe it wasn't like that in the middle. It was. \n\nNow, a quick note about me. I don't really ever send food back. I'm a gambler and I think ordering food is sort of a gamble- in this case I gambled and lost. Also, if a kitchen has already screwed something up I don't have much faith in them fixing it so generally I just let it go.\n\nAnd that is what I planned to do here. So my waiter comes back and says \"how is everything\". The following conversation ensues\n\nme: The steak is way overcooked, its inedible, can I get my check\nhim: It looks fine to me\n\nOk, thats annoying. Still, never argue with stupid people right...\n\nme: just the check please\nhim: I'll bring that right out\n\n15 minutes later the waiter comes back with another waiter\n\nNew waiter- I'm sorry sir, we cannot send that back, it looks medium rare to me. \n\nAt this point I am flabbergasted. Was I getting punked? Could I actually be eating in a professional restaurant? Let alone a nice one in Las Vegas? Could anyone working in a steakhouse for longer than 3's of minutes think this was medium rare?\n\nme: I'm not trying to send it back, I just want my check\n\nAnother 10ish minutes go by and I get my check. I choose to pay by way of the credit card. I put it in the little wallet thing and stand it up so all can see the card sticking out of it. At this point I look at my watch and think to myself \"how long could this take\". Turns out quite a while. After another 10 minutes I look around and I can't see any other customers in the place. I take my check and walk to the front where the host and 3-4 waiters are sitting in the bar area. I ask my waiter to run my card which he sighs and then does. Also, they charged me for the tenderloin tartare which is 1 dollar more than the Tuna....\n\nI then walked outside across the street and ate at stripburger.\n\nIn closing, Carne Vino greater than Morels"

You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nWe were bummed when Society Cafe closed next door at Encore, but Morel's more than makes up for that loss. Excellent bar and good wine selection as well."

The maitre'd was very pleasant, seated me right away and my server was very pleasant and attentive. \n\nHaving said that, don't waste your time or your money coming here, coupon or convenience factored in. My lunch fare of a standard moules frites and glass of Sauvignon Blanc was beyond underwhelming.  My initial pour of the glass of wine was the end of an old bottle and tasted like it. When my entree arrived, the smallest mussels I've ever seen sat in my dish. The largest few in the dish were barely average-sized. I don't know if they scale lunch down, but given its attached to a convention center, they may want to re-think that. The best part of my meal was the fries. Let me tell you, that even as a French Fry luvah, their fresh, hand-cut fries weren't enough.\n\nOverall, skip this place and seek other options ESPECIALLY if you're not staying at the Palazzo or Venetian."

EXCELLENT!  My wife the first night had filet mignon 8 oz... EXCELLENT!  Tonight my wife had linguini clam... EXCELLENT!  Our 6 year old Stanley shared with us off of our plates and from the sides.

Sides of the 2 days were saut\u00e9ed seasonal mushrooms, steamed asparagus, saut\u00e9ed green beans in butter, onion rings, and my favorite saut\u00e9ed broccolini...\n\nTo be honest with you I really enjoyed how our sever Esteve Sabbah made the Caesar salad dressing in front of us at the table.  The dressing was made from scratch with several ingredients that we had direct input of quantity during the salad dressing making.   This was just EXCELLENT!... \n\nI will not even try to attempt to explain the robust tastes coming from after meal desserts.

Each one of the courses is spaced out a good 5-10 mins till the next and the HALIBUT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. (4 stars solely for that) definitely one of the best I have ever had. So flavorful and yummy! The service was kind of slow and also I would suggest having some French music playing in the background to add to the experience. Also portions for the cheese sampler were tiny (kinda laughable) but yummy nonetheless. Overall a classy/relaxed spot for dinner."

After about 10 minutes, a waiter came and took our drink orders. About 20 minutes later, our drinks came. About 30 minutes after that, we GRABBED our waiter and asked him if he was planning to take our order. Finally, he did. \n\nWe placed a relatively straightforward appetizer + entree each order. About 15 minutes later, 3 out of 12 people received Caesar Salads that they ordered, but nothing else. Not until we called for the manager, and then waited another 10 minutes, did the remainder of the appetizer orders come. We're talking salads and soups here, nothing too difficult that would warrant so long and such a disconnect from the first salads. The manager was NOT apologetic and was incredibly rushed. He wouldn't really give us the time of day.\n\nThe entrees came some time later and were decidedly mediocre. The $120 lobster lacked flavor. The short ribs were dry. The salmon was bland. \n\nThere are DOZENS of better restaurants than Morels in Las Vegas. Why would anyone ever choose to eat here? We made the mistake. I recommend that you don't."

Walking to our table, I noticed the cheese bar where they had some real exotic cheeses.  The ambiance is good, with the lighting slightly on the darker side.\n\nIt looked like most everyone was having steak for dinner and the price ranged from about $30 for an 8 oz to $160 for a 8oz Kobe filet.  I went against the grain and order the arugula salad and beef shortribs.\n\nThe salad was superb.  The vinaigrette was perfectly balanced.  I'd highly recommend it.  It is garnished with small strips of bacon that were real tasty.\n\nThe shortribs were good and season well, though a bit on the dry side.  It is served on top of some mashed potatoes.  It was good, but nothing truly memorable.\n\nThe side dishes we ordered were good but the portions were a bit small.  The people in our group all had steaks and said they enjoyed it, but no one said it was a memorable experience.\n\nSummary:  good, safe choice but clearly not as good as Bouchon, CUT, or B&B at the Venetian."

We finally settled on Morel's, getting seated right away on the patio at a table for four.  The patio was a bit loud due to the TI Sirens show going on, and our table was small, but it was nice to be outdoors right on the strip.  Three of us started with the shrimp cocktail appetizer, which was four huge, delicious shrimp for $12, I believe.  All four of us had the filet, which was slightly overcooked for our preferences, but was delicious nonetheless.  The service was fairly attentive, but nothing out of the ordinary.  With so many steakhouses in Vegas, I wouldn't plan a specific trip to this restaurant, but if you find yourself at the Palazzo, it's a more than adequate option for dinner."

Park near the entrance closest to the check in desk will make finding the restaurant easier. I made a reservation for 6:00pm, but my friend and I got there early. It was not a problem and we were seated without delay.\n\nOur server, Mike, was amazing. He gave us great suggestions on wine and dinner options. He came by often enough to let us know that he was around, but kept away while we were eating or talking. When he got a chance to visit, he was funny and entertaining. Waters were refilled at half glass and food came out in a nice even flow. The service is definitely one of Morel's strong points.\n\nMy friend and  started with a cheese board. The ten year aged cheddar with salt crystals was magnificent with the fig spread and honey comb. Sweet and savory is always a winning combination. Paired with a Syrah, I was in heaven. A great start that was about to get better with a half dozen of the kumamoto oysters each. They were fresh, briny, and succulent. It was so hard not to suck them all back. Yet the wisest choice was to savor them. Next, I got the fresh fig and arugula salad. I am not a huge fan of blue cheese, but it balanced out the sweetness of the figs well. This dish had everything. It was creamy from the cheese, crunchy from the walnuts, sweet from the figs, salty cheese, spicy from the arugula, and perfectly dressed. Could this meal get any better? It sure can with a medium rare 14oz. 28 day aged grass fed NY sirloin. The steak needed very little. It comes out with three selections of salt and a few granules is all it needs. The black salt had a nice smokiness to it. To finish our meals, we got a scoop of black currant and green apple ice cream, as well as the vanilla almond profiteroles. The large list of ice cream flavors is impressive. They have a mixture of common favorites and some innovative flavors. Some that caught my eye was the orange honey, pear, black currant, and green apple. The profiteroles came with a side of warm chocolate sauce in a small container to ladle out on your own. There was no semi-sweet chocolate left when I was done. The candied almond slivers was a nice touch for decoration and tasty too.\n\nI can not rave any more highly about my experience at Morel's. So FIN!"

My wife ordered the quiche, I ordered the American Breakfast, and my mother-in-law ordered the Seafood Alfredo. My wife's quiche was a small pie slice shape with a lot of pieces of long onion strips. The quiche was runny and didn't have much flavor other than the onions. My american breakfast had 3 eggs with one slice of bread. For 3 over easy eggs, I was left wanting more bread. The sausage didn't seem fresh, and the potatoes were bland. My mother-in-laws Seafood Alfredo didn't have any alfredo sauce, and everything tasted like the salmon that was in the meal. The fruit plate that we order was the best part of the meal. Pineapple, Cantaloupe, Strawberries and Honey Dew were the main items, with some blueberries, honey and yogurt to fill in the plate.\n\nIn short, we wouldn't go back. There are plenty of other places that are better at breakfast for a much better price. The place was almost empty and now we know why."

After emailing the manager of the restaurant (which is really rare for me) they got back with me and offered to take care of me the next time I was there.\n\nFast forward 9 months and we came here again upon staying nearby.  This time around the service was great and we were both happier with the food.  We got bottomless mimosas, french onion soup, my girlfriend got the BBQ burger and I got the flat iron steak & fries.  \n\nThe prices seem like they are all over the board.  For example crepes with strawberry, chocolate, and banana are only $11, but onion soup is $10.  You can't order a single mimosa, but the bottomless mimosas are $25.  \n\nAnyway, regarding the food, I'll note we were there for weekend brunch and were given complimentary fresh fried dount type things.  I can't recall the name but they were pretty good.  The onion soup was very good.  Good amount of bread and cheese in it and my girlfriend who doesn't like onions and had never really tried onion soup before enjoyed it greatly.  \n\nMy girlfriend's said her burger was OK, but again here we ran into the same problem as with time before.  We are both picky about ingredients and when I got the french dip months ago it had spinach on it, which was not listed on the menu and which I don't like.  This time with the burger it had tomatoes on it but my girlfriend doesn't like tomatoes.  You may think it's totally normal not to list things like tomatoes and lettuce for burgers and I agree, but they DID list lettuce as an ingredient on the menu.  Whatever...\n\nMy steak was decent.  I usually don't like fatty steaks and it was fatty, but it was good.  The only bad thing was that the steak was really devoid of seasoning.  I've never salted a steak but I had to add salt to this one.  As for the fries, we both agreed they were fresh, but were also lacking seasoning.  \n\nLong story short, we like the food quality but don't care for the seasoning (or lack thereof).  The prices vary from appropriate to a little high but at least this time the service was good.  We may come back again, but I think my girlfriend will go back to crepes, which she liked the first time, and I'll try something new."

Just the extremely slow, slow service (experct to be there for 2+ hours) and the not so amazing food and drinks. We waited fifteen minutes after we were seated to get our menus, then an additional 25 to get drinks and bread. When our champagne came, it was flat and we had to send it back. The manager came over with a new glass, from a brand new bottle, which was nice. Second, the food is not amazing, but it's not bad. For Vegas quality, it is amazing. But if you have dined at fine restaurants all over the world you will  not be impressed with this restaurant. Overall, this is one of the nicer restaurants in Vegas, with nice (but slow) service - meaning no usual Vegas attitude, and decent food."

The location where we sat and the time of day had sunlight shining on us so we were resat.  Then they opened the curtains which made it too bright again.  They eventually closed the curtains.

Next course was Scottish salmon. The skin was nice and crispy!  Nice. Cooked a little over medium. A mushroom style sauce was good but just ok. Had a garnish on top. Not edible. Was not sorted through. Stalks were tough. (Virgin mojito was very good).  The pano cotta desert was good. But it was served with a big soup spoon.

Like other restaurants on the strip, Morels offers beautiful ambiance, great food, attentive service, good wine selection ... Yet, without being pretentious. It offers outdoor dining, but it was closed for the night because of they forecast rain that day. We got there early, and ordered wine and champagne at the bar and sat outside.\n\ni dined there on valentine's day. They have a special pre fixe menu for the occasion, but also served the regular menu, which I think is great. I would have been pretty upset if I couldn't choose and HAD to order the special menu.\n\nThere were 2 of us, we started off with sharing a fondue and then a dozen of oysters. They have a cheese bar, and as expected, the fondue is delicious. I don't know why I ordered seafood in a desert, but the oysters are great. Then, we had a filet mignon with a side pommes frites and the \"18 hour braised beef short rib\". The filet was juicy and done perfectly, but the presentation is \"very interesting\". There was the white plate, with the piece of meat in the middle and a slice of butter on top. Just that. I understand the simplicity and to showcase the steak just by itself, but I don't know if it looked that appetizing. Anyways, the fries were alright, but the truffle mayonnaise dip is fantastic. The short rib is of course really good. Tender, flavorful, but what could have gone wrong with braised rib. We were very full and didn't have dessert, but I would love to try their cheese plate if I come again.\n\nOn a side note, Morels is located almost right on the strip across from Treasure Island. When I made the reservation, I thought it would be nice to sit there, and be able to see their show. Well, I guess I had a long dinner, because I saw that show once at the bar, and again and again during dinner; and they lasted like 10 minutes. The explosions of fire, fireworks, lightings were rather distracting the second time, and a bit annoying for the third, even when I was dining indoor. It has nothing to do with the restaurant itself, but it might be something you want to consider when you book a table here for a date."

We ordered the following: - Salad Nicoise - Very tasty salad with seared ahi tuna, green beans, potato chunks, anchovies, quail egg (halved), olives, heirloom cherry tomatoes and tossed in a lovely vinaigrette - French Onion Soup - Now, that's what I call FOS! It comes in a small ceramic pot bubbling with the cheese melted over the bread on top of the oniony soup. Very delicate flavor and not at all salty. - Mushroom & Lentils Soup - Soup of the Day - soft lentils with mushrooms - dad liked it! - Mushrooms and Gruyere Cr\u00eapes - 2 huge cr\u00eapes smothered with creamy mushrooms. So delicious! - Short Rib Sandwich with green salad - very tasty short rib that you can cut with a fork! - Fish & Chips - Beautiful fish cooked in a light batter with home made yellow tartar sauce. Chips are thin strips of potato deep fried. Our order was a little slow in coming out after the soups came out. After waiting 25 minutes or so, our waiter finally reassured that our entr\u00e9es were coming out. Most of the dishes that were leaving the kitchen were breakfast plates. Ours was more of lunch items. When we paid for our bill, I noticed that our tea for my mum had been comped! That was nice! Will definitely come back to Morels and taste what else they have to offer."

It was just mediocre and nothing more.\n\nThe hostess greets us nicely and confirm our reservations with 5 tables and made recommendations which I appreciate. We were all seated and our orders were all taken the same time. Altho the hostess were friendly, the waiters could have been more organize and communicate with each other and their tables. By the end of the night 4 out of 5 tables were served. Our friends at the 5th table did not get their dinner at all. The waiters did not want to take ownership at first. They blame the other waiters and the other blame the cooks and for a good 10min came with a conclusion that our friends at the 5th table should just pay for what they consume. One of our friend was so upset he put down his money for the dinner he did not receive and walked out while our couple friends did not agree and ask for a manger to make it right. After another 10min they finally made it right.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the short ribs and it was above average but I enjoy the mushrooms and free complimentary bread more. My bf ordered the NY steak and did enjoy it but made a remark about for the price it was it should have came with sides. We both agree this would be a one time experience and would not come back again.\n\nI would have rated it a two star but I gaved it a three because of the friendly hostess and the manager finally making it right for our friends at table 5."

My only complaint is that the waiter seemed MIA at times, but was more attentive to other clientele. The servers were all way more attentive and picked up his slack, we didn't get our drinks till half way into our meal. Overall it was good, it's just that for the price that is paid, you kind of expect that these little things not happen."

The suite that we had booked at the Palazzo came with a 20% off brunch, lunch, or dinner at Morels and we figured that we would try it.  Honestly, I was less than pleased with my experience.\n\nFrom the get-go, it was bad.  The hostesses were a little brusque and seemed disinterested in seating us even though the restaurant was virtually empty.  She even tried to seat us at a table directly facing the incoming sunlight instead of moving us to a booth in a further location away from the glare.  We had to ask her to move us and she sighed, implying that it was a hard thing to ask of her.  It was extremely frustrating.\n\nThe wait staff was nicer and were very accommodating to our complete ignorance of their menu and specialty cheese.  I ordered the chef's special short-rib ($52) and the rest of my table had a gran plateau ($145!!!), which is a whole assortment of the \"chilled seafood.\"  This included ceviche, shrimp, oysters, 1/2 a dungeonous crab, and a lobster.  \n\nFrankly, the food was alright but definitely below my expectations, especially for the prices they were charging!   The short rib was tender but something I could have cooked at home.  Nothing very special.  And the chilled seafood tasted as if the seafood had been sitting in the freezer for a while.  Again, not all that special.\n\nOverall, the food and price was not good.\n\nThe decor did not salvage this place either.  There was no harmony to the place.  The blue and gray theme gave an air of depression and the lighting was less than perfect.  The booths' hanging lights were very classy and appropriate, but the lights outside of the booths were morose and in a dark washed cherry wood.  It clashed horribly since half the restaurant was themed modernly and the other half was Victorian/classic.  \n\nThough it was an experience, I don't think I'd recommend this place to anyone."

The boneless filet mignon (cheerfully butterflied and cooked well-done at my request, since the menu inaccurately indicated that the chef would only cook steaks rare to medium) melted in my mouth, seasoned generously with (I'm guessing) black pepper and rosemary. Sauce, scrumptious and served on the side, was not even necessary. Amazing wine, selected from the wine list displayed on an iPad left at our table, and the best negroni cocktail I've ever had. The desserts were heavenly and beautifully plated. The staff was welcoming, attentive, intuitive, courteous, helpful, and not annoyingly hover-y. A beautiful room, quiet music (unlike the I-can't-hear-you-even-if-you're-screaming-at-the-top-of-your-lungs-directly-into-my-ear-there's-a-G.D.-DEEjay-in-a-pricey-restaurant-LAVO-next-door), and a soothing atmosphere. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that my endive-and-poached-pear salad was, although fresh and fine, unremarkable and bland save for the addition of toasted cashews. Asparagus was flawlessly cooked, and the Potatoes Dauphinois are sex on a plate."

We have somewhat of a tradition going on of trying new places to eat at. Our most recent jaunts have been to French places. Morel's comes in at our number three experience at a French restaurant on the strip and it is dead last based on service and food.\n\nThe reason for two stars has to do with the food primarily. I can overlook poor service if the food is spectacular, but Morel's is putting out average food parading as fresh French cuisine. With so many other better options to eat at on the Strip Morel's should be ashamed at what they are plating.\n\nTo begin we ordered the fruit plate. An assortment of tragically cut mediocre fruit is what was served. Blueberries that were not fresh, but looked as though they had been frozen for days. ONE strawberry haphazardly cut, a measly portion of pineapples, cantaloupe and honeydew melon. I could have gotten this assortment of fruit at Denny's, in a bowl, as a side dish, without the $11 price tag. Truly a waste.\n\nI had: Crab Eggs Benedict. While the presentation was perfect the execution was poor. It was plain and simple: BLAND. The crab was tasteless, the bread was decent, the entire dish - didn't seem to be seasoned at all! To add to this, there was no salt or pepper on the table. I realized I should have salted and peppered my dish about halfway through it and at that point I basically said screw it, I'm just going to finish it.\n\nMy friend had: Crab Omelet with a side of potatoes, mushrooms, and peppers. This was touted to be amazing by our server.... it was also bland, lacking any real depth or flavor. The dish sorely needed salt, just something to make the potatoes pop. I've had better breakfast potatoes at numerous establishments that could beat these by a long shot. My friend ordered a side of mustard just to give her meal a bit more kick to it.\n\nCosta Rican Pressed Coffee - At $5 for the press this is a bit of a splurge, but honestly the coffee was the best part of my meal.\n\nService - Our server was nice, but the busser didn't bother to acknowledge our table's presence when we sat down. We were approached by a server who wanted to take our order AFTER we had already put in our order with another server. I mean, stuff like this I might dismiss at other restaurants, but not at a place where I'm paying $11 for a plate of fruit. STEP UP YO GAME MOREL'S.\n\nOverall - I will not return here. There are numerous other places in Las Vegas to find a good breakfast. And honestly if they can't do breakfast right I have very low expectations of their dinner service and quality of steaks."

I ordered the soft shell crab appetizer and was then told they were sorry but that was not available.  Isn't that the kind of information you're given upon being presented the menu?  Am I supposed to guess what they really have?  Disappointed, I move on and order a glass of Pinot Grigio and a pasta entr\u00e9e.  The waiter and trainee leave and I get a text from my friends that they will join me.  I can't get my waiter's attention because he's chatting with his friends on the other side of the room, so I get up and approach him.  When I ask if he can please ask the kitchen to delay my order until my friends have a chance to order he says \"no, I ordered that 5 minutes ago.\"  Am I at McDonalds?  In better restaurants the answer is never \"no\".  The correct answer is yes, and it's a cheerful yes.  Frankly, I was dumfounded and just stood in front of him until he offered to check with the kitchen.  I returned to my seat and watched him continue his friendly conversation without ever going to the kitchen.  When my food arrived I asked if it could be returned to the kitchen and held until the food for the rest of my party was delivered and this new server kindly obliged.  When the food for the entire table arrived my entr\u00e9e was still hot (thanks to the kitchen), and I assume my wine was still cold, since it had yet to be delivered.  We were all sitting and laughing into our napkins.  The place was practically empty and the guy couldn't remember a glass of wine.  Waiving my hand in the air did serve to gain the attention of what appeared to be a manager who got the wheels of progress in motion and when wonderwaiter finally came with my wine he tried putting on a good face by asking if we'd like more bread for the table.  I believe you can only use the word \"more\" in instances where there had already been \"some\" delivered.  One of my fellow diners started laughing so hard I thought he might choke on his bland and altogether unremarkable salad niciose.  I had no intention of choking on my altogether unremarkable fruit de mer linguine.  The dessert list looked enticing but my profiteroles were gummy.  Oh, the wine was very nice, once it arrived."

I had the huevos rancheros and added bacon( which was a fantastic idea!) and it was very yummy. Patio seating was nice and prices were very reasonable for being on the strip. (25$ mimosas, dish was 16$)\nOverall, it was a nice experience and I will return when family comes in town."

            "review": "I had very high expectations of this place after reading a number of reviews via Yelp, unfortunately this was not a favorable experience.  We ordered the escargot and shrimp scampi which was pretty good as appetizers.  I ordered the Bone In Filet medium rare, but it came out medium well to well done.  Our waiter took it back to have another re-cooked, the manager offered another glass of wine for me.  The 2nd time it came out, it was rare.  So they had to take it back again for a 3rd time and cooked it well, if I wanted beef jerky I could have gone to 7-11.  We also ordered the rib eye medium rare, but it came out rare as well.  \n\nBy the time I got my food, everyone was done with their dinner and the sides (steamed asparagus, puree de pommes & sauteed seasonal mushrooms) were cold, though they did bring out another mashed potato dish.  \n\nI love steahouses and was looking forward to going to Morel's for well over 1 month, but unfortunately I will never go back.  When you go a place like this, the expectations are very high.  To have my steak taken back 3 times is unheard of and inexcusable for such an establishment.   \n\nI hope that if you do go, you have a better experience than I did."

We had a reservation which was recommended but in retrospect probably not needed. The service was excellent, they waited on us quickly but not too pushy. The food timing was great too, not too fast but certainly not slow. I had the tableside bloody mary which was deliciious and entertaining. One thing is that the spices are quite mild so if you like it spicy I would go for an 8 or 9 out of 10.\n\nOur table had various breakfast items and they were all very good. I was the exception (as to what we had). I had the onion soup, because I love french onion soup, and it was excellent. RECOMMENDED ALL THE WAY. 5 stars would have gone to this place if it were a little less pricey, but i'm sure the rent in this area is huge. YUMMY."

It's not as big as other fine dine restaurants, so the noise level wasn't so high (thank goodness).  The decor was classy.  Our waiter, Richard, gave us excellent service!  He was very nice and always checked to see if we were okay.  At the end of our meal, he said goodbye and shook our hand. I saw that with other waiters as well.  I am not sure if it was customary in this restaurant or if it was just coincidental, but that was pleasantly different :)  We had the summer tasting menu and I guess depending on what you choose for each course you may or may not think it was worth the price.  I chose the fried shrimp for my appetizer and it was literally  \"a single shrimp\".  The salad with nectarines was yummy.  Unfortunately, the size of filet mignon was the tiniest I've ever seen.  At most, it was 3 inches x 3 inches and no more then 1/2 inches thick.  They placed it on top of a toasted piece of bread to make it look thicker.  Even my 10 year old would go hungry with this.  Luckily, the coconut panna cotta was yummy so that was a good ending to this meal.  My last negative...the restroom.  There was no toilet paper in the dispenser in my stall, but there was a bunch of toilet paper rolls on top of the tank and 1 on the floor.  In a fine dine restaurant, they should just check the restroom every hour because I dont think any of us customers will be placing them on the toilet paper dispenser (especially since this is a public bathroom where I try not to touch the surroundings."

IME the vast majority of the Strip restaurants tend to be soulless and robotic -- they're like machines where a big-name chef put his name over the door then left the local staff to dutifully crank out a set menu for mobs of tourists.  I'm used to having mediocre-to-meh-competent overpriced meals on the Strip.  \n\nAt Morels, I was there mid-afternoon (in between shifts -- usually not a great time to get good food) -- yet the food was delicious and tasted like somebody had really been paying attention when they made it, not just doing it by rote.  Steak was high quality and correctly prepared.  Fries were delicious and hot fresh.  Side dish, salad, dessert, all good.  Good selection of wines by the glass.  Service was attentive.  \n\nI suspect the experience may vary depending on how busy they are.  I was there with only a handful of other guests....I tried to go back one evening and it was mobbed, mobbed, mobbed -- it's in the lobby of the Palazzo so an easy meeting place, esp when there's a conference with thousands of people at the Palazzo conference center.   \n\nThat said, I'd go back in a hot second."

The service was just ok, but the food was delicious. My rule when I eat out... and I eat out A LOT... the service makes the dining experience GREAT. I would have given this place 4 or 5 stars if our waiter was more attentive. The restaurant was not even busy and we waited to get the menus, water, everything. I looked outside and our waiter was just goofing around...talking to his co-waiters. The assistant waiter was great. He was the one who took care of us for the most part. We gave him a cash tip so the other waiter won't get it because he was so lousy. After dinner I told the hostess if they have a comment card... I guess one of the managers heard me and he said you can tell me. I told him about our service and he was surprised. I'm thinking...(maybe if you do your job as a manager you would noticed)... WTF.. One more thing I told them that it's my friend's bday all we got are 3 very small bread sweets. Not even a candle. \n\nThere are so many places in LV to eat. I don't think I'll be back.

A much bigger portion I would expect for a starter (be cautious of this..it almost filled us up before dinner) and I had the 18-hour slow braised beef rib (OH MY GOD!!!!!) and Hubby had a barramundi fish special (awesome)\n\nI dont normally eat meat (I'm a Flexitarian) but was tempted by the Slow Braised Short Rib which is rare. I can never eat red meat ever again, as it will never compare to the pure perfection that was this dish. You touch the meat with your knife (which short ribs will usually vary from tender to like a shoe) and the meat fell apart. The sauce was mind blowing and I couldnt get enough.\n\nThe whole barramundi thing with my husband was quite comical to us. The waiter looked at us with our funny accents and treated us like we were a tad too 'common' for his eclectic tastes. He gave us the whole 'lesson' on Barramundi fish and we told him we love barramundi as we are Australian and its an Australian fish - we grew up on the stuff. \nHe insisted we were wrong it was a New Zealand fish and also corrected us on how to pronounce it - 'barra-mooooon-dey' (its an aboriginal word.. trust us, we know how its pronounced and that wasn't it) So we spent much of the meal saying Barramundi in sentences just to watch the steam come out of his ears. He was a slightly pretentious waiter - but they are the best kind. He knew his menu and his wines and his service was excellent. Just a small case of 'pole-up-butt' syndrome.\n \nAnother small touch I LOVED and which sometimes goes unnoticed: Hubby and I were dressed up as we were about to go to a show - the waitress who seated us automatically looked at what we were wearing and swapped our napkins to black ones. I hate getting white napkin fluff on my black clothes. It was an extra winning touch.\n\nThey had a fine range of after dinner wines and grappas, but I couldn't fit any more in which I regret. I really wanted to try some of their great cheeses they had on display in their cheese room. We will definitely be going back again."

There is a large cheese bar that you walk from the bar to the dining room If you're a cheese fan, you'll be very excited. \nWe started with a seafood platter that had lobster, crab, oysters and calamari. It was delicious but our plates were removed when we still had about half the platter left. There seemed to be some confusion about what the service staff was supposed to do when the soups were ready to come out. We got out plates back and I really liked the oysters. I heard the soup was good.\nThe red meat selection and presentation is impressive. There is wet and dry aged meat, boneless and bone in. There's also Japanese Wagyu which is pricey, meaning three figures. I had the bone in New York steak cooked medium rare. Everyone in our group got steak and all five of them were rolled out on a little table. We also shared several sides, including mashed potates and mushrooms. The steak and sides were delicious. \nThe desserts were good as well. We had the chocolate souffle which we had to order when you got our steaks. The waiter kindly made up aware of the souffles and they are definitely worth ordering.\nOne issue I had was that the dining room was dimly lit but on the plus side it was quite enough for conversation."

I told him this was the absolute worst service I have EVER had in any restaurant in the USA and Europe and NO TIP was coming out of my pocket.

This was a classic burger, nothing fancy and they managed to screw it up. \n\nIn the future I will stick with champagne and cheese at Morels. They are both excellent here...I had a second glass of bubbly to be sure!"

His name was Jesus and he came over and introduced himself and took drink orders to start. The problem was he brought back the wrong drink for me, and his 5 oz pours were very stingy for the rest of my party. He told my gf that the beer she wanted they did not have and so he said he would get something else. We did not see him for another fifteen minutes and so we just grabbed another waiter who I asked to get me to get a different drink and order one for my gf. Also he took our orders. Jesus only showed after we got our new drinks.\n\nSecondly, why this is a two instead of a three is the price. When I buy a $60 stake I want to know I'm eating a sixty dollar steak and sadly it was not up to that standard. If I paid $20 for it I think this place would deserve a three but for that price I was not blown away.\n\nOverall, this place is so-so, and for the price you can find something that you will absolutely love some place else in vegas."

Under new general management!!!\n\n4ish stars for food/atmosphere/etc.\n5 stars for service\n\nFull disclosure: this was the \"let us make it up to you meal.\"  Constantin, the new general manager, saw my review on Yelp and contacted me to apologize for my terrible experience (the first true apology I received, mind you) and wanted us to come back so he could make it up to us and show us how Morels has changed.  He seemed very earnest and I'm fairly open minded, so off to Morels we were!\n\nConstantin came right over after we were seated to say hello and thank us for trying them out again.  He briefly explained the menu he had planned for us and introduced Matt, our server.  Honestly, Matt seemed a bit nervous at first; I think he was concerned that we were super snotty or something, but after we chatted him up, he calmed down quite a bit and opened up a lot.  He was a good server and a cool guy! \n\nOn to the food:\nAmuse Bouche: Fresh Crab Salad on a homemade truffle potato chip.  Crab was excellent and the mixes of textures and salty/savory was great!\nOysters: Yummy Kumamotos; super good, as would be expected.\n\n(There are wine/champagne pairings in here, but I dont recall what they were; they matched wonderfully though!)\n\nAppetizer: Chef's Prime Beef Tenderloin Tartar: omg so good!  The quail egg and truffle chips were an excellent complement to the quality beef. I normally wouldn't order beef tartar, but I would order this again!\nIron Cast Roasted Branzino: I was very impressed with this dish.  I'm not a huge cooked fish person, but I recently tried the branzino at Angelini Osteria in Los Angeles.  Angelini is a favorite of mine but I only tried the fish because Wolfgang Puck praised it on Best Thing I Ever Ate.  It was alright.  The branzino here at Morels was so good; cooked perfectly, nicely moist, and served with a nice beurre blanc.  \nPetite Cut Filet: Pretty good.  I enjoyed the quality of the meat and the preparation.  There is an interesting cumin-based rub they use that might scare off some diners; I liked it but it did overpower some bites for sure.\n\nOur favorite cheesemonger, Jake (who is now a server) came by to see if we had any preferences and proceeded to hook us up with some amazing cheese.  Matt then had the gall to bring us dessert!!! I can't recall the name but it had some fresh fruit and a meringue mixture.  I'm not doing it justice, but it was a nice bite or so. I was far too full!\n\nBefore he left for the night, Constantin came to check on us one more time.  He was the consummate gentleman and totally made up for our previous experience.  While I 100% stand by my previous review, I'm sorry that we experienced Morels at such a down point (with the previous manager) and thought so poorly of the restaurant for so long.  Thanks Matt for being a great server! And, thank you to Constantin for having faith in us as customers to know good service and food when we see it.  \n\nWe're very excited to go back!"

This area probably wouldn't have been so bad, but this area also doubled as the smoking section for a family of Russians who decided to come out for a smoke while we were eating...not \"da harasho\" for us. So if this didn't make you feel like you were in the \"minority section\", I guess the lack of space heaters would. Every other table had at least one/two space heaters in the vicinity, but we got ZERO on a slightly nipple chill'n' night. When we asked Roger our server for one, he just responded with an off-the-cuff response that there weren't any space heaters (we're out of propane/not working). This would have been slightly tolerable, if we had just popped in unexpectedly, but we had reservations well in advance because this was for a bachelor party (also our tables and chairs didn't match the rest). The only way this was rectified, was luckily for us a food runner named Tommy took the initiative and went into action and GOT US A SPACE HEATER. I'm glad he stepped up, otherwise we would have just gotten left in the cold. \n\nSo why did we not get the attentive service we should have? Maybe our party looked young, and they didn't feel as though they had to go the extra distance, but whatever the reason, Roger didn't come through as he should have although I should say he was very professional in managing his ability to hold on to whatever tip he could hope for. Also his other assistant Mano (don't know the spelling) definitely did do a great job because he did most of the work (not a shock he was minority, haha). Of course, what should be said is that we were most likely just the recipients of bad service/management, but I throw it back to race and blame it on my  Filipino entourage.... Ok, all kidding aside, the moral of this story is that it's not necessarily race/discrimination, but sometimes its just crappy sub-par service whatever color you are."

Always had our water glasses filled, bread came quickly, the overall flow of the entire night was good with most of those small things that make a great dining experience. \nA couple of taboos, that weren't a big deal to us, but shouldn't be overlooked-\n- Ordered wine with our dinner. The sommelier brought the wine over, showed the bottle to my fianc\u00e9e, asked him of he'd liked it decanted, he answered yes. Then the sommelier put the bottle down and walked away. About 10 mins later the waiter came over and opened the bottle, then promptly threw the cork in the trash. After tasting, he poured it in our glasses.\n- I was lusting after the escargot for our appetizer and was told about 10 mins after I ordered it that they were out.\n- When we arrived we were told our table was running about 10 mins behind, so we went to the bar. For my pre-dinner drink I ordered my standard dirty martini w/ blue cheese olives. The waitress at the bar told me they may be out of the blue cheese olives so I asked if they could stuff some for me. She gave me some snide comment about it. For a French restaurant at this price point I should have never been told they may be out - did they run out of olives or blue cheese? No. They may run out of those that they stuffed already earlier in the night - stuff some more.\n- My mother and I ordered the special, fillet w/ crab on top and 4 asparagus spears. I didn't ask the price, so that was a bit my fault if I really cared, but the regular fillet of the same size was about $30 less than the special turned out to be. Not worth the ~1oz of crab on top of the fillet. Even besides that, the fillet wasn't great. \n\nIt feels like nit-picking when looking at what I've written, but for a nice dinner out, where we took my Mom & Dad out for their birthdays, when in the end we had a $600 bill for 4 people, both my fianc\u00e9e and I had the same 'ehh, not worth it and won't go back' feeling of the entire night, especially the 'ehh-ness' of the food. And these that I listed were not all of the small deficiencies we saw throughout the night. Hoping that a manager reads this and corrects his staff. Of all of the wonderful, high end restaurants in Vegas that I've been to, this is one I will not be recommending not visiting again."

When steaks arrived, the other 3 were definitely ribeyes. But mine absolutely looked like a New York steak. I asked the busboy who brought my dish if mine was indeed a ribeye. He said yes. I ate a few bites in and knew it was not a ribeye. Our waiter walked by several times without asking how our steaks were but noticed him looking at my steak but no mentioning anything. I finally flagged him down and said this is definitely not a ribeye. He said ok an brought it back to kitchen. Then few minutes later manager came to me and said they are making me new piece of meat. I asked if indeed mine was not ribeye but manager said he didn't know but that my new steak would be out soon. \nAll I wanted was acknowledgement that they screwed up and apology. Did not ever get it. Even when waiter came by with new steak I asked him if my old meat was New York steak and he said when it comes to mess ups , he just mentions it to his manager and let's him handle the kitchen and he also said he just washes his hands when it comes to the mess ups. Ridiculous that not one person took accountability and apologized for error. All they said was my new steak would be out soon. Wow. That was total turnoff. Especially when we are staying at the Venetian hotel , it was not representing the experience of the hotel. Bad bad bad.

We walked around, past the restaurants listed above (which are all on the top 40 Vegas list), into Morel.  \n\nTruth be told, the main draw that led me into Morel was that the hostesses were very easy on the eyes, so I thought this was the kind of establishment that employed these kinds of people as waiters as well.  Now that I think of it, it was very naive of me, because everyone inside waiting the tables were men.  Respectable and well dressed, but men nonetheless.  \n\nAt the hour we dined, there was only one other group dining, so they could have put us anywhere in the entire room.  They chose to put us right next to the station that all the waiters were standing by.  They could hear every word we said.  One of us offhandedly mentioned that we could use more bread, and one of the waiters came over to inquire if we needed anything.  While this might sound helpful, it was really nothing more than annoying.  I'm sure you can understand what it feels like to have no privacy when you want to share your opinions of a new restaurant between friends.\n\nThe restaurant itself boasts a fantastic view of the strip, and of the T.I. show that's just across the street.  We chose to sit inside because the weather was a little warmer.  The bar area is quite modern, with a couple of flatscreen TVs playing the Celtics game, but the restaurant area boasts nothing.  It didn't make me feel like I was paying $70 for a steak.  Maybe I'm alone in this opinion, but if I'm going to be paying so much for a meal, I want the entire package: good food, good service, good ambience.  The only positive thing I could say about the ambience was that it's quiet, which is doubly annoying if the thing I wanted was privacy (no extra noise to drown out our conversation).\n\nAnd now, onto the food.\nRibeye Steak, $64, medium rare, comes with sauce and no other sides.  Is the concept of having sides (vegetables) along with the entree that foreign in fancy restaurants?  Maybe it's not normal in a French restaurant?  I don't know.  Morel doesn't have sides with your entree.  You can order another side for $9-$12.  We ordered fries (yeah, don't ask why we paid $11 for fries), mac and cheese (we're not the fanciest of people), and this other potato dish.  The potato dish was the best.\n\nThe steak itself was the worst cut of ribeye steak I've ever tasted.  The only thing that was good about the steak was that it was medium rare, which surprisingly many places manage to screw up.  The steak was bland, the sauce was tasteless, and even the fatty part of the steak which I usually enjoy regardless of how the rest of the steak tastes was very disappointing.  Worst.  Steak.  Ever.  This also includes the ribeye I got at Chili's.  Yes.\n\nWhat else can I say about the restaurant?  The waiter didn't seem happy to see that we wanted to move a couple tables away from their immediate zone.  This would be understandable to me, except that with a bill of $240 the tip easily exceeds 4 hours of minimum wage labor.  \n\nThe toothpick came in an individual wrapper, and that was nice.\n\nGo to Table 10 instead, or splurge and go to CUT.  Save yourself some time and money."

As soon as I sat down, 3 different people approached, one for my drink, one for bread basket and another helping. So I have to say service was spot on, not sure what happened with the other yelpers that had bad service. I had the salad ni\u00e7oise, I have never ordered this before so I had nothing to compare it to, well the yellowfin tuna was a bit overcooked, the dressing had a good flavor, and that's about all I can say about this salad. Wouldn't order it again. What did peak my interest was their extensive cheese list, I would like to come back and just try some cheese and wine out on the patio. Also, they have happy hour from 12-6p, drink specials, and from 12-4p food."

We got our coffee and our server was very attentive in refilling our cups. Took our order, then eventually came over to drop off our meal which was just an average breakfast. Nonetheless, we were really excited to get our fruit and doughnuts. Our Server returns to let us know that they run out of \"doughnuts\" so instead the chef made us \"Creme Brulee\" instead at 10am?  Which was weird of him to not mention at the beginning of our meal. I also asked if our fruit would be coming and he said that it was \"choice\" of one or the other. Clearly he was mistaken, but I didn't feel like arguing since I was so disappointed about the house doughnuts. This place is definitely an upscale restaurant, but I was very disappointed in their service and will more than likely not return to try their regular menu since they can't even get their breakfast right."

After two awful experiences at Grand Lux we wanted to try something different and Morels did not disappoint. \n\nUnfortunately our brunch did not start off on the right foot. We were made to wait for our table to be seat up which was odd, considering the restaurant was empty and it appeared that all of the tables were already set up. Upon seating us the hostess gave a little big of an attitude when we commented that it took a little long to set up tables in what appeared to be an empty and ready restaurant. \n\nOther than the 'tude from the hostess everything else was fantastic. It's a shame too because I would have probably given them 5 stars if not for her. Our server was great, very attentive, very nice. My mimosa was perfectly made and they also offer a Bloody Mary bar. \n\nMy eggs benedict were fantastic, as were the order of pommes frites that I ordered as a side. (How do you go to a French restaurant and not try the pommes frites?) My husband loved his Croque Monsieur. The rest of my dining companions enjoyed their brunch as well. The stuffed French toast was tempting and I would definitely order it on a return trip. Brunch entrees were priced on the more expensive side when compared to a place in your hometown, but they were on par with hotel pricing."

Not one boob in his paintings looked natural.  I couldn't decide if it was art or more of a cartoon-type work, but as the idiom goes, \"The boob is in the eye of the beholder\".\n\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=hiLDnJAUR6o9vAEH_8BmVQ\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=aLI33JvcXjoe6vI-xbVvXQ\n\nIt has a beautiful wine bar and a spacious comfortable terrace (which they call a patio).\n\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=2hBacW9b6INPycSDqY11GA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=aiZj8CkK1NSFhI7ujjQZ5w\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=YQlwdGgpkhjKjtErmQjuLg\n\nHere's a virtual tour:\nhttp://delivery.vrxstudios.com/50372/virtualtours.htm?id=386407&id_type=2&locale=1&container=1\n\n\nWe were a group of 7.  Our table wasn't ready so we were offered to have drinks on the terrace.  As beautiful and comfortable as it is, if you don't care for the Las Vegas heat, you don't want to be there.  Maybe in February.  Some of us opted for the terrace, as for the rest of us - there was not really any other available place to wait.\n\nOnce seated, we found our server Rick to be friendly and efficient.   I still don't like it when a waiter announces his name, especially in an upscale restaurant.  I've never heard anyone call \"Hey Rick\" at XIV.  Depending on people's age and preference, it's always either \"Excuse me\", \"Waiter\", or \"Excuse me, Sir\".  Why do I need his name?  I'm not planning on exchanging Christmas cards with Rick...  \n\nI ordered Onion Soupe Gratinee and 18 Hour Red Wine Braised Short Rib, which was a mouthful, even before I got any food.  My date shared a Petite Romaine Heart Salad, served tableside, for two or more, with a friend.  For the main course, he ordered Grilled Halibut.  Almost everyone else ordered Kansas City Steak and Choice Filet Mignon.  We already had cocktails, so we shared 2 bottles of Red, don't remember which, but I do remember that Rick said that decent wine starts at $75.00 a bottle at Morels...\n\nMy soup was delicious, rich, full of onion and cheese flavors, and a good size.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=_k3UURyS2x98gCP0gEkl8g\n\nAs to Petite Romaine Heart Salad, I was told that it was good, but that Petite applied to the size of the salad instead of that of the romaine hearts...\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=pUHu4Va2XWQiWft7sxzuDw\n\nThen came my favorite part of the evening.  Our entrees arrived.  It was like a beautifully orchestrated symphony.  Seven waiters plus waiters' assistants all descended on our table at exactly the same time.  Things were moved, knives were placed, glasses were repositioned, and all our seven entrees magically landed in front of us\nat the exact same moment.  Talk about food orgasm, this was service orgasm!\n\nMy short rib was excellent, you could really appreciate the tastes embedded in it in 18 hours.  \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=GOnQcXc3tlm9SpNKq9fRqQ\n\nMy date's halibut was OK, I was told, but it looked really tiny.  \nAll side dishes are extra, by the way, so if you want a side of steamed asparagus, for example, that alone will knock you $14.00.  If you want a different sauce - that's extra too. \n\nNow to the steaks.  Of the 5 people who ordered them, 2 or 3 complained that the cut wasn't what it was supposed to be, that the beef was too chewy, and one complained of an overcooked steak.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=CIYQHfa3dExTAv4OMLw-ng\n\nTo make us feel better, we were comped two desserts for the entire table of 7 (a little stingy, considering, if you ask me).\n\nSo, based on my food alone, it would have been 4 stars, but given the bad steaks in a steakhouse, and prices that I thought were too high, the most I can give is 3.  \n\nKnowing that I will be writing a review, I, very not ladylike, craned my neck to see what my date was paying.  Two entrees, two appetizers, and about half a bottle of wine (maybe a diet coke too) - around $200.00.\n\nOuch.\n\nIf you happen to go there on a cool evening, sit on the terrace, you'll have an amazing view of the Strip AND you can see the Sirens of Treasure Island show that's across the street and runs a couple of times a night."

We came at the end of breakfast, around 1030am and so the restaurant wasn't that packed. In fast we were probably one of 10 tables there, and outside was closed since it was a bit windy. We ordered two cocktails, both of which were excellent, and necessary since when your in Vegas you are required (by law perhaps? :p ) to have a drink with every meal. My boyfriend ordered the french toast while I have the croque madam, I really liked my sandwich a lot but I have to say that my boyfriends meal was really what impressed me. The french toast was very nicely prepared and the flavors were off the charts, mine was a little heavy on the cheese for such a meal early in the day but that's mostly my fault since I knew it was quite the cheesy sandwich prior to ordering it. We had a $50 OpenTable gift certificate, so those always tend to ease the bill a little when traveling but still paid $70 out of pocket when all was said and done. I have to say for breakfast, for $120, it better be one REALLY nice breakfast, and although this was an excellent breakfast, the price really gives me pause. I believe this restaurant might have more to offer for their dinner menu, but if breakfast is going to run you this much I would expect the average dinner to two around $200-300 depending on what you ordered. \nWith this is mind, would I come back here...only probably with an OpenTable gift certificate, otherwise I would most likely choose a different place for breakfast. But I feel the 3.5 stars I would like to give, given the great drinks and food, can be rounded up to a 4."

You just cant go wrong here.\n\nServices are super and waiters are extremely attentive.  You have at all time minimum of 2 waiters at your disposal at anytime.  Have their own head cheese master that is exellent and super knowledgeable on all the cheeses they have.\n\nFood from apettizers of oysters to the lovely dry aged steaks are just to die for with the mushroom sauce.  I dont like the American charboiled burnt style steak, so this French style prepped steak is my all time favorite.  Best steak I ever tasted is here and that is why I keep going back every single time I come to Vegas!!  I come here religiously every few months when in town!!\n\nWell worth the drive there or the flight there and the stay there and the money spent!!\n\nWriting this review is making me want to drive there this weekend from LA........\n\n\nDecor:  4.5 out of 5\nAmbience:  5 out of 5\nService:  5 out of 5\nFood:  5 out of 5\nRepeatable:  NO DOUBT and I HAVE!!"

The food was wonderful, two of us had omlettes, two had country breakfast and one had steak frittes.  Also had a bottle of Champagne and the fried shrimp as an appetizer.  Loved EVERYTHING.  Minor issues with service (forgot appetizer plates, didn't bring condiments with meal) but problems quickly rectified.  Met the General Manager Constantin who genuinely cares about your experience in my view.  \n\nDon't let the uneven reviews regarding the service deter you from trying this place.  The food is definitely worth a visit and if you order a cocktail or a nice bottle of wine (very reasonably priced I might add) ... We get to Vegas fairly regularly, and will definitely be back."

If your not ready for that, maybe Branson is more your style. \n\nOn to the Review!\n\nOn any occasion necessitating a gathering of men in Sin City, the \"Steak Night\" is usually the highlight of the trip. Its a right of passage for Gentlemen of Means. Red Wine and Red Meat. This trip was no different. \n\nThe meal began with a knowledgeable staff taking us on a tour of Australian vineyards. 3 bottles to be exact. Each complimenting a different portion of the meal. All 3 . . . EXCELLENT. \n\nMorels is a la cart (like any fine steakhouse should be). For a man there is only 1 cut of meat that you are allowed to eat. That is a ribeye. Morels had several different rib-eyes. I went with the grass fed. It was excellent. I had it medium (as any man should do). \n\nThe table split 6 different sides, my absolute favorite being the Truffle Macaroni and Cheese. It was very good. My lease favorite was the mashed potatoes. They were simply average. \n\nI concluded the meal with a cappuccino, some sambuca and the profiteroles. All delicious. \n\nI don't want to take anything away from Morels. It was an excellent meal. Its just that for a Las Vegas steakhouse I expected more. There was nothing that made this place shine above several of the other places I have eaten. When you get together with your friends once every few years you expect the best. And this place is slightly below the best."

            "review": "We enjoyed a relatively late new year's eve dinner (10:00pm).  The top reasons I made reservations for Morels a couple of weeks before were:\n\n1. Proximity to the strip.  It's right by the Palazzo entrance.  Easy for us to run out and see the fireworks in 30 seconds.   \n\n2.  They were serving the a la carte menu unlike a lot of other restaurants that night doing some $250+ per person prix fixe bs.  I'd rather just do the full meal deal at Joel Robuchon instead paying that kind of money for overpriced NYE menus at Comme Ca, Koi or holy crap god forbid Sugar Factory.  \n\n3.  STEAK\n\nOur starters were the \"Onion Soup Gratinee\" and the \"Pan Seared French Rougie Foie Gras\".  The soup was a 3 out of 5.  We prefer our onion soups a little more robust and wine flavored where this was kind of sweet.  It was a hearty portion as it should be for $10 but not worth ordering again.  \n\nThe foie gras on the other hand was deeeeeelicious.  It was accompanied by caramelized red onion, candied apples and balsamic reduction.  There's just something about the fatty and unique flavor of the duck liver with fruit that I can't get enough of.  Restaurants in Vegas like Andre's and Gordon Ramsay Steak do it really well and this was right up there.  \n\nFor the entree, we chose not to mess around and just went with the 32 oz porterhouse for two prepared rare.  They served it tableside and it came with roasted rosemary potatoes, fricassee of baby turnips, sauce Bordelaise, onions & carrots.  We asked to keep the bone as always either in hopes of being ambitious a few days later and using it to make beef noodle soup at home or just gnawing at the bone while walking down the street like a couple of insane canines later in the evening.\n\nThe steak was very good.  32 oz is a monster cut and we were only able to finish half and box the rest.  I actually preferred the sirloin side over the filet this time around which was kind of surprising for me.\n\nAll in all a very solid choice for steak but still not close to the best steaks in their own building thanks to Mr. Batali and Mr. Puck.  I would come back here for happy hour and also when it's warmer to dine outdoors."

            "review": "On a trip to Las Vegas recently with my boyfriend, we were wandering through the shops at the Venetian, and I saw a sign for \"Date Night\" at 7 restaurants in the Venitian and the Palazzo.  We weren't sure if we were going to do it, but later that day we decided to check on it, and sure enough we thought it sounded fun, and Morels sounded the best out of what we like, so we went for it.\n\nThe \"Date Night\" is some sort of Prix Fixe menu (3 courses for $40) on Wed-Fri until sometime in mid April.  We got there and the place seemed very nice.  Looking at the three courses, we were amazed at the deal we were probably getting since one of the items on the Fixe menu was $38 by itself.  We both got the menu, and we ordered some cheese as a cheese course between the entree and the desert.\n\nFor those who don't know, there is a ridiculous cheese bar.  By ridiculous, I mean ridiculously awesome.  There are around 60 types of cheese, and just trying to choose some for sampling was overwhelming in its own right.  We ended up choosing some English Cheddar (because the bf is from England and complains about the American Cheddars), a strong blue, and some Camembert.\n\nThe Fixe menu consisted of three courses, soup or salad (he chose salad, I got soup), salmon (which looked a bit boring) or braised short rib (which we both got), and profiteroles or a lemon tart (I love lemons so went with the tart while he got the profiteroles).  \n\nThe soup was amazing.  Seafood corn chowder.  Very rich and delicious.  I think my bf was jealous, but he wasn't going to say anything about it.  The entree was phenomenal.  Lately, all the short ribs I have had were super fatty, greasy piles of meat, and this one was fairly lean and just falling apart.  It was served with cauliflower puree, bacon, and a few vegetables.  The cheeses were to die for.  I could go back here on any trip to Vegas just to get some cheese.  We also got some prosciutto with the cheese and some sweet and spicy almonds.  The almonds were quite tasty, and the meat was divine.  The cheeses were served with fresh honeycomb and date puree, both of which went well with the cheese selection.  I also got some sweet wine to go with it, and it was amazing.  The ages port was also one of the best ports my bf has ever had.  The desserts were tasty, but not spectacular.  The two best things were the cheese and the short rib.\n\nThe service was great too.  Always attentive, and our water glasses were constantly being filled.  I'd recommend this place to anyone, especially if they are doing a Price Fixe event!"

The weather was wonderful, so we perched on the patio, which is great for taking in the views and people, but elevated and set behind a fountain to protect your experience from the strip commotion.  The service was exceptional.\n\nQuality is where Morels excels over many strip competitors.  Every item offered is consistently of the highest quality, and crafted with precision.   I love their massive cheese list, offering many cheeses from all over the world.  The cheese menu is well organized by cow, goat, and sheep milk; then it is sorted by texture.  The meat and rillette (pate) selection is considerably smaller, but all high quality items with detailed descriptions.  Next time I want to order the Scottish Salmon rillette.\n\nThe charcuterie presentation includes tags on each cheese with the name, description, and region.  We ordered the 3 cheese, 3 meat board, which also showed up with the most delicious honeycomb and fig preserves.  Our 3 cheeses:\n\n1.  Mimolette Extra Vielle - Nord-Pas-de Calais, France (Firm Cow's milk) - salty and a little nutty, once banned by the FDA\n\n2.  Valencay Pyramide - Loire Valley, France (Semi soft Goat's milk) - mellow and savory, one of Napoleon's favorite cheeses\n\n3.  Idiazabel - Navarra/Basque, Spain (Firm Sheep's milk) - buttery, nutty, smokey; pairs well with salami and cured meats"

Since we were staying at the Palazzo, we just dropped by around 8pm and they were able to seat us.  However, the only reason we were able to get a seat is that the outside patio was open.  While they had a few heaters amongst the tables, ours did not have one.  So we were quite cold throughout the dinner.\n\nFirst off, let me say that the food is very good.  I don't think there was a single complaint or issue with the food.  I had the bone-in rib eye, and it was superb.  My colleagues also enjoyed their entrees.\n\nThat said, here was the bad during my dining experience.  First, we asked for a wine menu, which our waiter completely forgot when he came back to take our order.  So after ordering a 2005 cab from Napa, we received a 2006.  Unfortunately, my colleague didn't notice this, and he was the one who had selected it and approved the bottle.  Second, after we were served our entrees, we asked for steak knives.  They could only scrounge up 2!  How can a steakhouse run out of steak knives?  I don't know, but they did.  Finally, I would have expected them to move the heaters around as they become available from tables being vacated, especially given how it was cold that night.  It wasn't until I mentioned it to one of the waiters that they made any effort to move them around.\n\nSo, while a restaurant may have great food, the overall experience can be ruined by a lack of quality service from the staff.  So I give them only 3 stars out of 5."

My husband and I arrived at the host stand and informed the three girls behind the podium that we were there to join them for happy hour and asked if it was available on the patio. The general reception was less than warm and we were told that yes, happy hour was available on the patio and in the bar. \n\nIntending to head out to the patio on a cool November night, I asked if there were heaters and was told, \"uh, yeah, not sure which have propane...\" seeing where this was going I decided just to sit out there. The girl that escorted us back was literally sneering at us and when we got to the patio, she pointed at the first table and said, \"there.\" Not exactly host-like.\n\nSitting at the high top table, we noticed that there was a serious wobble in the table. So serious that when anyone adjusted in their seat, our waters spilled a bit. We asked our waitress if we could move to one of the many low tables on the patio, and we were told that those are reserved for dinner and that they would be full (later I am assuming) but we could sit inside. I asked if an exception could be made due to the fact that the table was broken and I was told no so we moved inside. \n\nThe happy hour is two drinks for one and you can share but only if you are sharing the same thing so no mixing and matching. I ordered the happy hour white and my husband the Kronenbourg. The funny thing about two for one is that it basically takes that price of one drink down to what it would cost in any other city so it isn't really a deal if that is what you are looking for. We however, were not looking for a deal per se; we were looking for cheese.\n\nReading the reviews, the cheese selection was supposed to be one of the best in Vegas. I am quite the cheese lover and actually know a fair amount about cheese and like to be challenged and try new things. I was expecting a much more robust program including explanations and descriptions. There were none and our waitress didn't seem to know too much except for what was \"good\" which isn't really helpful when describing something as complex as cheese. \n\nRegardless, we got five cheeses and when they didn't have one of the ones we ordered, they gave us an extra one (which was nice-ish since she gave us the one we specifically said we didn't want - weird) and subbed out the one we ordered with another one I didn't want since it is a cheese I get regularly at home. A choice would have been nice. \n\nUltimately, we had a huge amount of cheese, some booze, and were hanging out in Vegas so we were fine however if I want cheese again, I would head to the Wynn's Le Cave which has less to choose from but a much more knowledgeable and  friendly staff."

The short ribs were really good, it just melted in your mouth.  You didn't even need a knife to cut it.  The bordelaise sauce that came with it was a good complement to the flavor of the ribs.  The mac and cheese on the other had was average at best.  It was kinda dry and lacking flavor.\n\nOverall this place is pretty good (food and service) but it's a bit pricey."

It's nice to be able to get dolled up and arrive at the restaurant without having to take a taxi (especially since it was about 100 degree outside!!). \n\nWe started off with a cheese platter. We told the self proclaimed cheese monger the various cheeses that we liked and he brought out a selection of 6 cheeses that he thought would match our tastes. I actually only liked 1 of the cheeses - it tasted like parmigiano reggiano (LOVE). However, everybody else at my table seemed to love the cheeses. \n\nAs for our entrees, we decided to share multiple dishes, family-style. We ordered the halibut, filet, bone-in ribeye, the linguine special and a side of truffle mac and cheese. My favorites were the linguine and mac and cheese, of course, as I am carb lover extraordinaire. The halibut was well cooked, but lacking in flavor and the steaks were comparable to say.. a Ruth's Chris, with a 20% mark-up.\n\nAll in all, good meal with great company. I love how my girls can eat a big steak dinner before going clubbing. That's how we roll."

There wasn't too much of a crowd, and we were able to get seated right away. The waitress seemed pretty uninformed on the menu, and she flat out didn't know about the 4 course summer special advertised at the entrance of the restaurant. \n\nI ended up ordering a fish and chips, and the food was not bad. The fish was over-fried and a bit tasteless, but good with some S&P and the home-made tartar sauce. The quantity of food was definitely more than I expected.\n\nOverall decent to stop at if you're passing by, are hungry, and have $30 to shove into slightly-above-average food."

Eggs Benedict for $17 and not good = me not happy!  The omelette had egg shells in it and I told the waiter, but they didn't seem to care.  \n\nThe manager's way of making it \"right\" was to send a dessert to our table - chocolate and peanut butter.

My husband ordered the grass fed NY steak which was seasoned perfectly and cooked to correct temperature, but by far the best of the night was the Braised Short Rib.  It was slow cooked in a sous vide for 18 hours.  It was so tender that a knife was not needed.  Our server Jerry was excellent.\nNow for the things that bugged me a bit.  They were out of asparagus as a side dish.  Then I ordered a salad that was supposed to come with cashews and they were out of that too.  Really asparagus and cashews?  Probably could have got some at a grocery store near by.  The other thing that is not such a big deal, but seemed weird was that it is a gigantic restaurant and it was almost empty.  When I asked the server about that he said they really only fill up during convention time.  That is such a shame since Morels is such a beautiful restaurant."

I called last week to check that the patio was open for breakfast and that it was heated.  The woman I spoke to said, \"Oh yes!  It's very nice.\"\n\nI was there close to opening time this morning.  When I went in, I asked the host if the patio was open.  He said, \"Yes, but it's cold out.\"  I replied that I knew and I had dressed warmly.  I was shown to a table facing TI.  During the 45 or so minutes I was there, I had no company on the patio and the heaters were not on nor were any turned on for my benefit.\n\nHaving read the Yelp reviews and the menu online, I think I knew when I went I would be ordering the mascarpone stuffed French toast.  I also got the Kenya AA Oaklands Estate coffee that was done in a French press.  I got a glass of tomato juice and some tabasco to make my spicy breakfast drink.\n\nThe French toast was excellent.  When I ordered, my server, Carlos, asked if I wanted the syrup on the side which was my choice.  The French toast is a nice sized round of tasty bread filled with mascarpone and topped with fresh strawberries, bananas, and a few raspberries.  The cinnamon on the toast and some crunchy sugar on the berries added to the fine flavor.  The syrup was good, but I could use it sparingly the French toast was so good.\n\nCarlos brought me a second pot of coffee and I enjoyed sitting there watching the workers do some painting of the walls.  I hadn't seen any graffiti from New Year's Eve partiers, but maybe they were just cleaning up some foot prints where people jumped the wall to get to the closed Boulevard.\n\nI would have given Morels four stars but for the heaters.  When you call ahead and get a yes answer and then it's not true and no one offered to light the one right behind me, it's a service let down for me.  Carlos was a fine server and we talked about where he had parked NYE so he could get to work and back to his car with the street closures.  He gave me some tips I'll put to use next year when I do go to the Boulevard or close instead of watching on TV."

We turned up in good time for our reservation and were shown to a remote corner of the restaurant with no view, even of the rest of the restaurant. We requested a move which was facilitated but I felt our waiter was unimpressed by our cheek. I was reminded of Steve Martin in LA Story 'Usual table, sir?' 'No, I'd like a good one, please'. However, after this shaky start, things improved greatly. The steaks were magnificent, done exactly to order and accompanied by a very acceptable Pinot Noir preceded by the obligatory Cosmopolitans. The bill, however, for three without dessert, was an eye-watering $350. Special occasions only unless you win big at the tables. Which we hadn't. Should be five stars but only gets four because of the indifferent service and relatively poor value for money."

The cheapest food you can eat is at the Grand Lux Cafe, where the food sucks by the way, and the free drinks you get when you sit at a slot machine. So we were in for a little treat when we sat  down at Morel's French Bistro. \nAs soon as you get seated the waiters will pamper you. I personally hate that kind of service, but, we were all tired of gambling and a little babying was not too bad. \nWe sat down and the waiters do that napkin thing onto your lap. Then several waiters come out to help you pick your wine (which was unneccesary cuz I'll ALWAYS pick the cheapest bottle n e way) and they wait next to you till you make your decision. \nWe started with some soup de jour which was some really buttery bacon-ie ham-ie chowder. It was too buttery for me but good.\nThen came the mussels for an appetizer which was pretty good.\nI chose the seafood fettucine which the sauce tasted like the soup i had and BAD OYSTERS. I couldn't even taste the lobster or the clams. I already had the mussels so basically i had more soup de jour with pasta.\nThen my bro's plate came which was the sirloin cooked medium. And my fiance's plate which was the same cooked medium-well. I had a bite of each and they both tasted GREAT. We had the artichoke side which complimented the large portions of meats. \nThe meat dishes were very plain (a big piece of meat plotted on a big plate with no decor) but the taste made up for what was missing. For all the money you'll be spending you'd think they'd put a little more on the plates, eh?\nSo, i learned the next time i go to a steakhouse, STEAK is what i'll order. GEEZ.\nThe bill came out to about $250-260? and we left a $100 tip (because of the service and it was around Christmas). So it was worth getting pampered for that amount of cash or was it all PRETENTIOUS???\nI give it a 3.5"

Very good but I thought the brioche was a bit dry; fortunately the cinnamon, maple, and copious amount of bananas made up for that. This is actually a good dish for sharing as you could separate the two layers of toast without make a huge mess.\n\nGrilled chicken and proscuitto panini - Excellent. Bread has a perfect crisp and the melted-cheese-to-protein ratio  was spot on. Came with a hefty serving of frites which were delicious and salty (how I like them).\n\nI washed everything down with a bloody mary, which they make at your table to your specifications. I ordered mine ridiculously spicy with Grey Goose. Best damned bloody mary I've had in recent times and worth every penny. \n\nService: outstanding and worthy of a higher tip. The tableside-crafted bloody mary was in a service league of its own.\n\n(My rating scale:\n5-Outstanding, sets the standard for others. 4-Very good, would bring friends/family here. 3-Decent but wouldn't recommend to others. 2-Disappointing. 1-A waste of everyones' time.)"

We were seated right away and waited on - meticulously - by three people throughout brunch.  We were three women and the gentlemen waiters were helpful, polite and prompt.\n\nThe brunch menu looked divine, but I'm a sucker for cheese.  I was impressed by the selection of cheeses and charcuterie.  I talked my friends into having cheese fondue with me.  Yes, for brunch.  So there.\n\nThe fondue arrived and was the perfect balance of wine and cheese.  Neither was too strong.  It was a symphony of taste that I never wanted to end.  The bread was crusty and soft, fresh and fragrant.  SO GOOD.\n\nThe coffee was strong - a fair trade Rwandan blend - and I loved it.\n\nThen we shared the fries with the seasoned mayonnaise (divine!), a plate of saucisson (a dry salame thing made in France, that I love) and a smoked salmon flat bread.  The saucisson was sliced wafer thin and served with more yummy bread, sweet cornichons, pearl onions and a fancy, stone-ground mustard.  My tummy was full and my heart was singing in tune with my taste buds.\n\nGreat atmosphere, comfy chairs, right on the strip with indoor (what we opted for) and outdoor seating.\n\nCheck this place out.  I *will* try their dinner menu on a future trip to Vegas... but I am craving their spectacular brunch.  And, next time, I *will* sample something off the delightful Bloody Mary cart."

I especially like the fresh baked bread that came with the cheese. Note the uploaded photo so you can see what we tried. From there I went with the 22 ounce dry aged rib eye. When that steak arrived with the sides of green asparagus and pom frites (shoe string fries), I was not disappointed. They cooked the steak perfectly (for me) and I made a valiant effort to conquer the steak. It was the cheeses that undid me. If I just avoided the appetizers (or get a smaller steak!) I would have been able to down everything. I was also thinking that one could theoretically come here just for cheeses and meats! I really enjoyed the food here and appreciated the knowledge of the waiters."

It's easy to get wrapped up in all the hoop-la and forget what is at the core of eating out... the food.  I actually planned on having a rack of lamb at Delmonico's that night until I was convinced otherwise by my business associate. \n\nMorels may not have the celebrity chef attached to their name but they don't need the hype. If you are a true fan of the dining experience, do yourself a favor and come here. The star of this location is you and the food that is presented exquisitely. \n\nMaybe you're thinking I'm talking crazy bashing Ramsey, Emeril, Bobby Flay or any other of their likes. By all means that is not what I am doing because I enjoy eating in restaurants they attach their name and will continue to frequent their establishments. What I am saying is that Morels does it better in Vegas as far as I am concerned. Although who I am but a humble foodie who was privileged to meet executive chef Carrera who has been cooking for the owner for over a mere of oh 25 years. \n\nHis attention to detail in his plating, seasoning and selection of prime cuts doesn't grant him a TV show but it should.  His humble nature as he explained he approach to cooking makes him even more remarkable. Why you may ask? Well I'll tell you... His focus is on his craft not on himself. He lets his dishes speak for himself and not the other way around. \n\nWe were treated by the chef to a sample of Tuna Tartare, although it was only bite sized, it was a mouthful of delectable flavor. I knew this bite size treat was a good sign for things to come. \n\nThe Grand Plateau DE Mer was presented to the table and sadly since I'm allergic to shellfish, I could only enjoyed watching my dinner guests satisfy their palettes. It looked fabulous and the attention to detail was duly noted in the lobster. They take the time to extract the tender meat from the claws and carefully fold them whole into each half. The sauces stacked on top were seasoned to compliment the snow crab, shrimp, lobster and oysters. At least this was explained to me by those enjoying this dish. This is one that should be shared because it would be a feat to finish alone. \n\nAlthough I was delighted to see how this dish was enjoyed by others my stomach began to be shellfish and grumble waiting for my entree. Yeah that was cheesy but at least I briefly laughed when I wrote it but I digress.  Finally my Colorado Rack of Lamb with a honey-mustard crust ordered medium rare arrived.  Ordered any other way would be a crime and a dishonor to this beautiful creature who sacrificed its life for my enjoyment.  \n\nA moment of silence please... \n\nOk moving on the lamb sit on top of a wine enriched rosemary bordelaise sauce that was not over-powering or too sweet.  Every bite was tender and it balanced well with the bread crust which drove the flavor home.  This is now the best lamb I have had in Vegas and my only regret is not trying it sooner than I did.\n\nI paired this with potato dauphinois which is similar to scalloped potatoes just on a whole different level. The potatoes had this crusted on the outside from being in the oven and the center was soft from the creamy consistency of the sauce. All in all it was amazing and the portions were reasonable, I had room for desert.\n\nI had, from what I remember because I was in a midst of a foodie comatose, the chocolate dome.  It was an amazing finish to a great meal.  If you can look past the hoop-la of the celebrity chefs, do yourself a favor and focus on what matters the most... the food.  Morels is sure to satisfy your every craving and then some. \n\nBy the way, if you were wondering my lamb was better than what I normally have in town at near by Delmonico's."

The place was very empty for 8 pm but that just works for us in better service. The service gets 5 stars. Our waiter was very attentive and patient, answering my numerous questions about their rather large menu. We started with the cheese fondue and it was great. Next, we split the Kansas City steak and lobster special. I thought it was one of the best steaks I've ever had, just perfectly cooked, not fatty, and juicy. The Pommes Frites were solid but nothing special. We ended with the chocolate souffle and it didn't disappoint. With two glasses of red wine, the total was under 200 bucks with 30% tip which is a bargain in my eyes. What kept it from being a 5 star meal was that you could see the Pirate Show at the Treasure Island and that took away from the ambience in my opinion."

The whole time I was sitting there I wished I had walked from Palazzo to Venetian to dine at Bouchon instead. So close to a fabulous restaurant (well, a long winding walk through two casinos and an elevator ride), and I went with the more convenient option instead. Oh well, next time I won't make the same mistake. \n\nI did have a seat out on the patio, which was nice on a beautiful March Vegas day, but the view doesn't compare to that of Mon Ami Gabi (the French steak house at the Paris), although it does offer a glimpse of the strip. I had some time, so I didn't mind waiting a long time for my meal, but it took them forever even to bring me my coffee, which I desperately needed, and which ended up being the highlight of the meal: Strong, delicious and French press brewed. They bring complimentary beignets, which is nice, but these were cold, and nothing to write home about. I had the banana and mascarpone stuffed french toast. I think this is a good dish, maybe a touch too sweet for the portion size, but my maple syrup had a firmed up into a film and took away from the overall enjoyment. I do think that the place is probably better overall than it was the day I visited, but I won't rush back here. Next time I'll take the long winding walk to Bouchon instead."

            "review": "2.5 stars.\n\nI had high hopes for a great steak dinner at Morels, given that this very upscale restaurant is located in the fairly new and decidedly fancy Palazzo.  A few years ago I had one of the best restaurant steaks ever at Delmonico in Palazzo's little-sister hotel the Venetian, so I think it's reasonable to expect even better quality from the higher-end hotel.  Unfortunately, in my case the experience fell well short of my expectations.\n\nWe were seated quickly at around 7pm, at which time the dining room was relatively empty and a large crew of servers stood at the ready.  The room itself is fairly low-key and classy, with interesting art hanging on the otherwise plain walls.  I like the decor, but I wouldn't mind seeing a bit more design effort.  The front part of the restaurant where you come in features what looks like an oyster bar with a dark wood theme, and I wish they had carried that aesthetic throughout the rest of the dining room.  As it stands, you'll spend your evening staring at relatively unadorned light blue and white walls and large view windows facing the Strip.\n\nOur waiter was quite chatty and informative, giving plenty of suggestions and lots of insight into Morels' impressive cheese and oyster menus.  My buddies and I were in fact very satisfied with the cheese and oyster plates that we ended up ordering as appetizers.\n\nMorels also offers an extensive wine list, with a varied selection of wine styles spread across a wide range of price points.  However, one thing that bugged me just a little bit was the nature of their wine service.  Morels keeps a sommelier in their employ, but this person doesn't bring out the wine list to help you make your selection.  Instead, you choose your bottle, and then the sommelier appears with the bottle and pours it for you.  When your glass gets low, he swings by your table and tops you off.  Now I'm all for sommeliers, but wouldn't it be better if he showed up earlier and guided you through the wine list, helping you make a pairing based on the food you order?  I'm a wine novice so I certainly would have appreciated the help.  As I said, not a huge complaint, just kind of odd.\n\nSo onto the entrees, and here is where most of the stars got deducted.  First of all, the food took a while to show up.  Of course, this is pretty typical for a fancy restaurant, but by the time our wait started to feel long, the room hadn't really filled up yet.  That said, I am generally willing to give the kitchen staff the benefit of the doubt.\n\nWhen our sides failed to arrive with our steaks, and none of the many servers carrying the steaks acknowledged that we had even ordered sides, my mild lack of enthusiasm turned to full-on disappointment.  We tried to wait out the 10 or 15 minutes as our sides were hurriedly prepared and brought out; they turned out to be pretty decent.  The steaks, however, were really, really average.  They were cooked to temperature and had nice marbling, but they tasted plain and unseasoned, with hardly a trace of that meaty flavor that a $50 dry-aged steak ought to have.  It was the first time in many Vegas steakhouse trips that I contemplated using the dipping sauces.  To cap off the meal, I ordered my customary espresso for dessert and it turned out pretty poorly; all evidence pointed to old coffee beans.\n\nAll in all, the dining experience was mildly enjoyable, but heavily marred by the deeply unimpressive entree.  For the same price, I've had much, much better experiences (and steaks) at Cut, Mesa, and Delmonico.  Sorry, Morels."

Service was poor from the very beginning with us waiting almost 10 minutes to get an order for drinks in, we were actually the first and only table in the restaurant. We decided on the 4 course tasting menu, which I was very excited about since the restaurant was so highly spoken of. \n\nThe first 2 courses were ok, charcuterie and beef tartare, nothing special about the food or presentation, and the salad for course 3 was overly dressed. Main course was the \"petite\" filet. Typically a petite filet is about 4oz of meat, mine was the size of a tablespoon. I wish I would've taken a picture of this sorry excuse for a steak. It was played with the worst looking piece of scalloped potatoes ever made. Everything came out cold. Dessert, which was a strawberry crepe, was also cold like the watered down coffee that was served with it. \n\nThe manager was at the table beside us and heard our conversation with the neighboring table about how bed the expletive was and instead of coming by to address it, opted to walk away and hide in the distance. Talk about amateur hour. I paid over $200 for a dining experience that was worth about $20. What a joke. I wish I would've taken pictures to truly show how pathetic this place really is."

They are on top of it and attentive, without hovering, polite, quiet, and charming.  One of my favorite things to experience here is the \"fromages\" course.  They have an beautiful cheese menu that you may order a selection from and they give you some wonderful accouterments, such as honeycomb, fig compote and soft breads.  Last time I visited we had our server pick a selection for us based off our interests and he did a fabulous job, it was such a fun experience.  \n\nThe french onion soup is the best I have had anywhere and their croque monsieur is to die for.  I have attended lunch several times, and I have appreciated the fact that the restaurant was not loud or boisterous and not too packed.  It is always a pleasure to eat at Morels..."

But none of them were particularly impressed. I asked the server for a recommendation and he recommended the Pork Milanese. It was a HUGE thin cut pork chop. It had a nice crust, but kind of bland. After about 2/3 of it, I got tired of the flavor monotony and just gave up.\n\nPro-tip: It seems that the high reviews were from people that ordered the steaks. Maybe we should have followed suit."

            "review": "I came here Sunday 6/12 with a girlfriend for brunch during Restaurant Week. I love Restaurant Week because you get to enjoy good food and it's for a good cause. A portion of all proceeds goes to help the Three Square food bank in Southern Nevada. She made a reservation online using Open Table for 11am. Morels is located in the Grand Lobby at the Palazzo, right next to the hotel check in and Lavo. We arrived promptly for our reso and it was found right away. We asked to sit outside on the patio and we were seated at a table in the shade. \n\nThe Restaurant Week menu included a 3 course meal of either breakfast or lunch. Dinner is also available later in the evening. My friend and I opted to do both breakfast and lunch and share everything. The first courses were seasonal fruit and yogurt and a Greek salad. We got to pick our mains and we chose steak frites and classic eggs benedict. And for dessert we got vanilla creme brulee and a strawberry crepe. I also ordered an orange juice, and she was supposed to receive French pressed coffee as it came with the breakfast, but it wasn't until we were well into our second course that we had to flag someone down to bring us the coffee. My friend also said she would have probably ordered a bloody mary from the cart they had, but was never offered. That is the only gripe I have to say about Morel's is the service was lacking. \n\nFood wise, everything was delicious. The seasonal fruit was fresh and paired nicely with the vanilla yogurt. The Greek salad was like a wedge salad with tons of olives, feta, and tomatoes dressed in a light vinaigrette. The steak frites was an 8oz piece of skirt steak and fries. The steak was cooked perfectly medium as we requested. The fries although plain were quite tasty. I dipped them in some ketchup. I enjoyed the classic benedict, which was 2 poached eggs, country ham and a generous amount of hollandaise atop a thick piece of brioche bread. Last but not least, dessert. The vanilla creme brulee was fantastic. I loved breaking into the sugary shell and indulging in the smooth vanilla egg custard underneath. I could have eaten the whole thing, but I had a delicious strawberry crepe waiting for me. The crepe was light and airy, filled with a lovely whipped cream and then topped with strawberries, bananas, and chocolate sauce. For both of us we spent around $32 with tax and tip which is not bad when brunching on the strip. We both agreed that we would definitely come back to Morel's."

            "review": "Steakhouse for Thanksgiving dinner? Why not! Since we're in Vegas, we'll go to a fancy place for a special dinner. Fancy? Yes. But does the food taste good? Well... it was ok. All main dishes come separately from side dishes. We had 8 adults with 7 sides. No appetizers. We were stuffed!\n\nFilet mignon- got it medium. Wasn't really pink in the middle. Chewy instead of tender. Bland. But they do give you 3 kinds of rock salt to rub on your steak and a beef gravy to pour too. But any bite with the rock salt was waaaay to salty. Would've been nice if meat was already spiced. If the steak could be seasoned better, I'd be a happier camper. I did not like the rock salts and having every bite be like I'm tasting the ocean instead of the meat. I'm not a fan of brown gravy, so I can't say I liked it. \n\nNew York steak- medium rare. Much better! I should've gotten med rare for the filet too. Also bland. \n\nSalmon- wasn't fully cooked. But where it was cooked, the seasoning was just right. \n\nMashed potatoes- yum!!!!!! Loved it! It's not a regular mashed potatoes. Buttery and moist!! I could eat more of that. \n\nGreen beans- loved too!! Black pepper and salted just right. \n\nMac and cheese- delish! It had a crust of cheese on top that made it more savory. \n\nMushrooms- again delish!! \n\nService- seemed like a nice guy, but he only came to our table when taking our orders and bringing the food. He couldn't even figure out who ordered what dish. At a nice restaurant like this, the server should know where to place each plate. We did have 3 kids but they weren't crying or screaming. Were really good. But we still tipped well because it was Thanksgiving and the guy was probably not in the best mood working that night. Bummer for us to get the blunt of his not-so-good mood. \n\nWould we go back? We'll probably check out some other steakhouses in town."

We were there for the prix fixe \"Dinner & a Show\" menu, and I took off stars because 1) The staff didn't manage the timing very well and we were late to our Blue Man Group showing at 8PM, and 2) They gave me and the boyfriend someone ELSE's bag of leftovers (we didn't think to check to see if our TWO delicious, juicy medium RARE sirloins were in our bag; it wasn't until later when we were about to refrigerate the meat that we saw only ONE steak in there, and it was a flat, sad-looking, medium WELL bone-in something.  So much for our plan with the leftovers!).  But other than that, our servers were generally courteous and kept our drinks topped off, even though one was utterly thrown by my request for a \"house non-alcoholic drink\" (I was on meds).  He acted like it was a hardship, but I didn't back down, and luckily the bartender came up with something delicious.\n\nFood gets 4 stars.  Not the best, but certainly better than average.  My French Onion Soup was probably the best and biggest I've had (the cheese was tasty and stringy, not rubbery, all melted on top of the toasted slice of bread), while my enormous 14oz sirloin (standard size) was good and cooked to my liking, but I felt like they added an unneeded sauce or something.  I did enjoy the mashed potatoes.  Loved the dessert of 3 different creme brulees (my favorite two were the pistachio and the vanilla bean), but unfortunately no one at my table was able to get more than half down because like I said, they kept us too long and we missed the beginning of our show.\n\nThe atmosphere was pretty interesting in its variety.  Definitely upscale, but I liked the fact that to get to the dining room, you have to walk by an appealing glass case stocked with gourmet cheeses.  Hung on the walls of the pale blue room with dark wooden trim were large erotic paintings (no body parts were shown, but the positions of the men and women more than hinted at what was going on).  The patio looked immediately across the street to Treasure Island, so those folks were treated to the fireworks display.  The black chandeliers were vampish, which I thought was cool.  As the evening wore on, the large space with high ceilings got pretty dark.  Bathrooms were nice and pretty much what you'd expect.\n\nWon't be back as there are other restaurants to try out, but I'm glad we did give it a chance."

Fresh crabs, a delightful citrus hollandaise.  However, the poached egg was cooked solid.  The yolk was not running at all, and last time I checked, a perfectly poached egg has runny yolk.  That is a definitely cooking faux pas.  Unforgivable.\n\nDefinitely headed to Bouchon instead, next time."

With that in mind, we booked a table on Opentable.com for 8 for a 40th birthday dinner at Morels and what was supposed to be a special dinner turned out to be a disaster.  \n\nFor starters, we were seated in a separate room away from the main room that had zero ambiance and was empty except for us.  This was followed up by what can only be described as slow service with our waiter only passing through once in a blue moon.  At one point, one of our party had to get up to go find water since we were all sitting there with an empty table and nothing to drink.\n\nAs for the meal....I'd give a 1.5 stars since one of the steaks was good.  Two of our party had the Porterhouse which was tasty.  It was ordered medium-rare and was cooked well.  Unfortunately, the rest of the meals were sub-standard.  One of the other steaks was also ordered medium rare and was sent back since it was overcooked (it arrived warm/hot pink in the middle).  And then we waited. And waited.  Our waiter showed up (amazing!) and told us it was coming.  And then we waited some more.  Then the manager showed up and told us it was coming.  And then it showed up a minute later.  All said and done, almost 30 minutes passed between when the first steak was sent back and the second one was delivered.  \n\nNot only does that make it awkward with the rest of our party eating, it also ruins the ambience of the table and is quite frankly unacceptable.  I wish I could say that they got it right but the second steak was worse than the first one.  It was essentially raw (read: cold and red throughout the steak except the far edges) and could only have been thrown on the grill for 30 - 40 seconds at best.  By this point, we had all finished eating and didn't want to continue the ordeal.  \n\nBut wait...here's the best part.  They charged us for that steak and when we asked that it be taken off the bill we were told no...your steak was cooked to perfection. \n\nSorry guys but no it wasn't.  When you can compare one medium rare steak to another one and visibly see the difference, it's not cooked to perfection.  While restaurants define medium rare slightly different, a quick web search of the definition of a medium rare steak shows the following:\n\n\"A medium rare steak should be warm through the middle with a hint of red. Most of the center of the steak should be pink. The sides should be well browned, the top and bottom charred to a dark brown color. This steak should have a firm surface but soft in the middle.\"\n\nIt's not supposed to be COLD and RAW in the middle.\n\nRestaurants are about more than the food.  The ambiance, the attentiveness of the servers and the attitude of the management all factor in.  \n \nGood customer service means working w/ your customers to resolve a problem when it arises.  For a $60 steak they ruined what should have been a pleasant meal and the manager's behavior was beyond unacceptable.  Their refusal to even discuss the poor service and food left all of us appalled. \n\nOh yeah, and they don't do anything special for birthdays (like a cake or dessert).  \n\nNever. Going. Back.\n\n\n\nPS - The rest of the evening went well so that saved the entire night."

But I'll start by saying, my steak was nicely marbled, and cooked properly, their fries were very nice as well, and the salad was lightly tossed in a vinaigrette and not overly drenched in the stuff.  Service, while pleasant, resistant to the idea that, I don't want fucking potato salad with this cut of meat, I would like fries... Don't ASK the chef, tell him that's what I would prefer - and he'll do it regardless of how much he hates the idea.  So, based on all of the above, I'd have given them 3 stars.\n\nBUT\n\nFirstly: They have, what might possibly the best cheese selection in Vegas.  My doctor hates and loves this place for me... I'm turning 30 soon, and he tells me I should take in more calcium in my diet to help my bones finish their structure properly.  Most people drink milk - I eat ooey, gooey, smelly, stinky cheese to fulfill this request of his.  Unfortunately, it's going to give me high cholesterol when I finally get the blood test he's been asking me to get for the past 3 years.\n\nSecondly:  They have a fantastic beer selection.  I've been to quite a few places in Vegas, but this place seems to have the best selection in beer. AND they don't have Bud Light on the menu THANK GOD - A serious beer menu for a serious beer drinker. They do have a hole in the menu that, could be filled (the Sommelier agreed - And he wrote the menu) for a Porter.  But all in all, if you like beer (anything with \"light\" or \"lite\" in the name isn't beer... It's alcoholic soda water - Grow up and have something flavorful) go here for a round or two at the bar."

It was around 4pm on a Monday and we were able to go to patio seating easily, though we needed the host to seat us, and they needed to take our name down as a reservation. I got the Grimlet, it was refreshing - came in a glass. I guess I was expecting it to come in a bronze cup thing, though I had seen customers at the next table with one.  My friend had a salad and it was a small portion, but looked delicious, I ordered the calamari, which was $20.00.  It was good, but not spectacular like I had hoped. The server was gracious and so seemed the rest of staff. 2 drinks and two side dishes later, bill came out to be approximately $80.00 (incl. a $15 tip).  So, I'd say it if wasn't for the experience and patio view, I wouldn't spend that much for a restaurant again."

The General Manager /staff/server made every effort to make sure we had a wonderful brunch for my mother in laws 85th birthday.  I will say that the General Manager contacted me after my first yelp review and told me to contact him when in town to give the restaurant another try.  As a small business owner, I was totally impressed with this personal touch.  It also resulted in a very pleasant second meal at Morels.  \n\nWe dined inside on this visit, and that was a very pleasant experience.  Nice, crisp, clean dining room with lovely paintings (of a sexual nature!) on the walls.  It was relaxing and enjoyable.\n\nMy husband and I shared the fried prawns, and they were DELICIOUS!  I loved the basil dip that came with it and saved it to go with my frites.  YUMM.  I ordered the steak frites, which was very good....even better with the dip (or pistou as the menu calls it).  \n\nWe had a lovely bottle of champagne to celebrate our great meal.\n\nI will happily return in September for brunch when I am at my yearly conference in Vegas."

I decided to make the online reservation and get ready for an adventure.\n\nPalazzo is a beautiful hotel in the heart of the strip, and Morels is the perfect restaurant there.  Its decor is sexy and chique, using black and white with hints of wine, and very sexy paintings on the main wall.  As we entered the restaurant we were greeted by two lovely ladies who sat us indoors near the windows.  \n\nOur server was more than helpful, and as usual I asked for suggestions for lunch.  He brought out the dinner menu because their steaks are always available, and I went with their 100% Kansas raised bone in new york, medium.  For starters we had a charcuterie of  proscuitto and salami, complimented with 3 types of cheeses: a blue cheese blend of goat and sheep milk, as well as a brie and capricorn.  It arrived with some walnut cake slices, fresh honey comb, walnut spread, as well as a mini baguette sliced to eat, grain mustard, mini pickles and pickled onions.  All of it was savory, beautiful, and incredibly wonderful to eat.  With the steaks we ordered mushrooms sauteed in truffle butter, along with pomme frites with an out of this world truffle mayonnaise made in house.\n\nAll of the food was heavenly.  First, the cured meat was freshly sliced nearby, and we watched the chef slice it deli thin along with the cheeses.  He was meticulous with the plating despite it being a casual appetizer.  The cheeses were fabulous.  I am not a blue cheese person, but I will eat that blue cheese we ordered every single day if I could afford it.  The honey comb along with the walnut cake was amazing, as was the other two cheeses we ordered.  \n\nAs for the steaks--I couldn't be happier.  The carry over made the steak the perfect medium that I desired.  With nothing but salt and black pepper to season, as well as a teaspoon of herb butter on top, it was thick, juicy, and worth every penny.  The side dishes weren't just side dishes--they were meals in themselves!  Mushrooms were just the right texture and seasoned well, and the pomme frites were the best I've had in Vegas.  I love a good fry, but when you add a dipping sauce like a truffle mayo that they make, it's to die for.  I wanted to smother it on everything.  I could taste the hint of lemon zest and black pepper as well.  It was fantastic.\n\nWe ended the lunch with their signature souffle.  I've had one before at Wolfgang Puck's, and it was fair. This, however, was incredible.  Soft, fluffy and light as it should be, the dessert itself wasn't overpowering and because they used premium cocoa, the sweetness was well balanced.  Their vanilla bean sauce was so good.  I wanted to lick the plate when I was done.\n\nOverall, a great meal at under 200 dollars.  Well worth the price tag.  In Vegas, it's easy to spend a lot of money at a restaurant that serves mediocre food.  Morels, however, is worth every penny.\n\nMake the trip.  It's worth the time."

You've been warned. \n\nIt should be a sign that a French steakhouse on the strip is completely empty the majority of the time- because ANYWHERE else would be a better choice. \n\nOver priced for the quality of service, ambience, and food. \n\nService- HORRIBLE customer service. Just awful. I'm not sure who was our actual waiter because our first waiter made a HUGE, clumsy, rookie mistake (I don't want to go into details about that, because for benefit of the doubt it was a freak accident, not an everyday occurrence) and was swept away before he could even apologize. At least 3 other waiters took his place. Unfortunately quantity didn't equal quality. All lacked professionalism for this being a more \"classy\" restaurant. The real problem though is the manager. The manager of this restaurant needs to take charge, have a mandatory customer service training for his staff, and remember that the customers are important and it is his job to make sure they leave happy, full, and satisfied! The way the \"clumsy mistake\" was handled was NOT okay. Not by a long shot and that was definitely the worst part of the whole dining experience.  \n\nAmbience- It was basically empty except one or two other tables. This was 730 on a weekend night. Besides the actual restaurant, the bathrooms looked like they haven't been remodeled since before the Palazzo was built, and the soap used to wash your hands is the same kind you get at the dollar store, Softsoap, and it was obvious water had been added to it to make it last longer.  \n\nFood- food was just okay. Not bad, but not something worth going back for. There are better steaks that are cooked how you ordered them, all over the strip. The tartare was served with what looked and tasted like ruffles potato chips. Sauces and salts were brought to the table without an explanation of which was which. \n\nIf you want a \"fancy\" meal on the strip, or are craving a good steak, don't just settle for this place because of convenience or short wait time! There's a reason! You will be disappointed.  \n\nAs a side note, we were given a name and email by the Palazzo to express our experience at Morels, whom we emailed within an hour of our meal. It's been over 72 hours and we still have not received a response."

They proceeded to walk us to the farthest back table, as if we were wearing escaped state pen prisoner garb.  It's hard to get the \"vibe\" and atmosphere of a joint when you are miles away from another diner.\n\nThe next major issue was the service.  I think the best word to describe it is just clumsy.  The waiter seemed disinterested.  The wait staff themselves were just a mess (at one point trying to take the side of mushrooms that was half full when we were not done eating).  When bringing the bottle of wine, they attempted to just pour it, without even  the courtesy taste.

I ordered it medium-rare and it was cooked properly, even though they've been known to have a hard time cooking a steak to a diner specifications. I had wanted to order some asparagus but they were out, so I got artichokes instead - these were only okay. So yeah, the steaks?  A total miss.\n\nThe seafood on the other hand... we got the seafood platter and it. was. phenomenal! The shrimp cocktail (which is usually just average) was the best I've ever had. The texture of the shrimp were just perfect, the chilled crab delightful and the oysters were fresh! They shuck them to order, and have a varied selection of sizes that span the east and west coast. These fresh fruits from the sea were served over crushed ice (how else?) accompanied by fresh lemon, mignonette (no shallots or black pepper to be found though), cocktail sauce and a whole grain mustard mayo. Wonderful! \n\nThey definitely boast the most fantastic cheese selection in Las Vegas. My only concern is that they do not seem busy enough to possibly sell enough cheese to be turning it over quickly. With cheese, as soon as you cut into a wheel, the quality of it begins to go down. However, everything I had was delicious, especially with the fresh baguette, house made date spread and honey comb.\n\nThe charcuterie platter was equally delicious and a fantastic savory compliment with whole grain mustard, cocktail onions and cornichons! Mmm. Cured meats are my kryptonite.\n\nI was informed by a former manager of the restaurant that Morel's had the best French Onion soup in town.. I found this to not be so. It arrived at the table not quite hot enough, not enough cheese, although the broth was robust it still seemed to be lacking something. If you're there and it's what you're craving, then okay.. but definitely not worth going out of your way for.\n\nThe pistachio souffle with cherry ice cream was more than worth the wait and I'd highly recommend it! I'm a sucker for a good souffle, and Morel's can do theirs right.\n\nThe wine list is also worth a mention as it is varied and lengthy and well thought out with a lot of interesting bottles. If you find the list intimidating, their French sommelier Alex will be more than happy to help you find something you'll adore."

First off, we asked for bread as service was slow three times and each time we asked, we were told it was coming. Finally, after 30 minutes, we got bread. The biggest disappointment, however is when our main dishes arrived at the table. We were a party of four and all of us received our steaks cold. If that wasn't enough, two of our steaks were over cooked. After dinner, we got a few desserts to share for the table, one of which was baked Alaska. If you've ever had baked Alaska, it's not a difficult dessert to make. The baked Alaska was the worst I've ever had. The cake was frozen and they poured way too much 151 on it when the flambe'd it. Not the dinner experience you're expecting when you spend all that money."

Morels in Vegas is much bigger in every way, from the menu to their digs in the relatively new Palazzo hotel on the Strip.\n\nThe service (crappy attitude, but more on that later) is generally good and so is the food.  I would say the food is actually very good.  Be sure to try their steaks and seafood.\n\nAll that said...... Yes,  I am the asshole that is going to give this place a one star.  Was it one bad night?  Probably.  In this case I'm just not going to forgive.  I'm taking the contrarian, glass half empty view, they-didn't-care-about-me-so-fuck-you kind of attitude.  I've been to plenty of great places, and I'm a great customer to those that \"get it\" and know how to serve, especially when they charge top dollar.\n\nI was there with a total of three people.  All of their wait staff seemed to be pretty responsive, and attractive to boot.  Our waiter was charismatic.  Too bad we didn't have a female.\n\nAt issue is that my friends and I were going to order entrees with a little bit of an appetizer to get us going.  And that's where our waiter came in.\n\nHe basically started **selling** us on the big appetizer platter.  That it'd be good, it'd be perfect for the three of us, that we'd enjoy it... A real sell job.  It got to the point that I started thinking, I wonder what I can afford as a monthly payment... And where do I sign the lease papers before this dumbshit has to go back to \"talk\" with his \"manager\"?  It was THAT bad. \n\nWe thought, fine. Let's get past this.  It's generally good to trust your waiter for recommendations, right?  We go for the appetizer platter.\n\nThe sommelier stops by to assist with their very extensive wine list.  Again, a sell job.  The sommelier is having us go through the $400+ list.  This guy is selling pretty hard.  We instead go for a bottle from the regular list that's a little lighter on the wallet.\n\nAppetizer comes in on a cart with three waiters to set it up.  Holy shit!  Appetizer alone is a frickin meal and a half.  All great quality, but just complete overload.  Since we trusted the waiter on his advice, we do courteously inform that it was just too much.  \n\nHis response?  Eh, that sucks.  Just eat as much as possible.  \n\nSo we struggle through the massive appetizer platter.  Then our main courses come.  Again, fantastic food, but just WAY too much.  \n\nAs we're going through the meal, the armies of wait staff zoom by our tables.  I overhear from a few, how they sold this expensive dish or that bottle of $1,000 alchohol.... So everything put together I'm thoroughly pissed.  I'm feeling like we were completely fleeced by this waiter.\n\nFood was really good though, we just had nowhere to put all of it.  The waiter had the nerve to ask us about desserts after we had made it perfectly clear throughout the meal that the food quanitity was insanely too much.  \n\nAnd the bill for three, all in with gratuity ended up being a little over $600.\n\nMy advice if you do come here:  1)  Know the menu beforehand and what you want to order, 2) Don't get fucked by the waitstaff's \"advice\".  They're in it to make a buck, not take your dining interest to heart.\n\nBon appetit."

Although my husband and I were a bit early, we didn't get seated until 9:20.  It wasn't that the restaurant was busy, it's just that the staff were moving at their very own super-slow speed.  We were asked to be seated in the bar, which was perplexing when we could see that the restaurant was more than half-empty.  (And: half-empty on a Friday night? Bad sign!)  The bar staff didn't acknowledge our presence until the same second that the hostess was finally coming over to seat us.  \n\nThe whole meal was uninspired, and service was glacially slow.  The cocktails were mixed by an amateur.  The appetizers were bland and plated poorly.  My petite filet mignon was also plated poorly: why was it just tossed onto a massive platter, instead of using a plate that was of a more appropriate size?  The steaks were well-cooked, although they weren't the superior cuts of meat that I had expected based on the price.  The pommes frites were nice, but the other sides were cold, and we couldn't find a server to actually do something about it.  The sommelier kept on recommending bottles that were twice as much as we had said that we wanted to spend (and really, it's not that hard to recommend a bottle of Bordeaux in the $250 range).  When we booked the table, we had been planning on having a cheese course and then apertifs and dessert.  We bailed on that after appetizers and mains took over two hours.  \n\nGo get a table at Bouchon.  Order cocktails.  Chat with the sommelier.  Order the steak frites.  Don't skip dessert.  Every single aspect of the Bouchon experience is miles better than Morels.  Bouchon is less expensive, the service is better, and the food is amazing.   Morels should be embarrassed to be in the same city, let alone the same hotel."

The ambience was nice and we had reservations so we were seated right away. \nI'm giving it 2 stars only because my 18 hour braised short ribs were pretty decent ... It would have been better had it not been COLD. When they said \"18-hour braised\" I didn't think they meant it would feel like 18 hours had passed before you got your food. \nMy entire party's food was cold. We had ordered some drinks and wine, and had to wait at least half an hour for us to get our drinks. Some of them got the wrong drink order and some drinks given to the wrong people. I supposed when it takes you that long to get a drink, you tend to forget whose drink belongs to whom -__-  still, I'm pretty sure it doesn't take that long to get wine. I mean.. 1)open bottle 2) pour 3) serve. \nService was AWFUL. It didn't seem like the waiters really knew what they were doing. They offered to split our checks, and at the end of the night, said they couldn't. Maybe because they knew they were already going to get gratuity?? (Our party was 6+) who knows. The table next to us were seated after us and they got their good before us. The staff looked like they were running around like headless chickens not really doing anything. The place didn't even seem that busy. \n\nDefinitely not coming back here unless I had the whole day to wait for mediocre food and an extra $100 lying around that I really NEED to get rid of--for a plate of food that I could easily get at the Cheesecake Factory for a quarter of the price."

Gave it to our waiter, said he'd never seen that before . Ok so we still ordered our drinks . My husband a Pinot noir and me Prosecco. Ordered the rigatoni and my husband the ribeye . Also ordered a dozen oysters and cheese platter . All in all food was delicious, don't get me wrong . When our bill came ,our server said he couldn't take the coupon and to talk to our hotel or the Grazie desk . Ok , no big deal . When my husband was signing the bill , for the tip he asked how much do we give . I have a tip calculator app . Our total amount came to $ 190.83. So the app said $28.50 for a tip . Instead we gave $25.00. As he walked away with the bill in hand , he opened it and rolled his eyes . I'm like really . Are you serious . Why $25 and not $28 for the tip ? Well first like I said the food was delicious but $40 for oysters etc . The night before , we ate at Table 10 , Emerils restaurant and it was waaaay better than here . Price , quality and service. I understand this is a French restaurant but way overpriced. I mean $ 25 is $25 . I don't know what he was expecting. Lesson learned here . Won't be returning here . Table 10 , I highly recommend. I think we could've gave a $30 tip and he still would've rolled his eyes . Ppl shouldn't be greedy and thankful for whatever they get . Also for this being a French upscale restaurant, the music they played was Elton John Benny and the Jets , Journey etc . Come on . Oysters $40 side of asparagus $14 but we need to listen to this kind of music in a fancy restaurant. Looks like we were the ones who should've been rolling our eyes . Save your $$$ and go to Table 10 instead . No greedy waiters there."

The server had an attitude as if he didn't like his job. \nServer Mike(Dark hair Caucasian male) said 'fucking people' then denied saying that. He said he didn't say 'fucking'.He stated they it was referring to another party early from today. \n\nRobert (Tall asian gentlemen) the manager, came to the table and did not want to comp the whole meal. He asked if there was something he could do and I said to comp the whole meal but he said no.  \nHe offered to comp us a drink or a dessert but I decline. We are not heavy drinkers and do not do a lot of sweets. I just asked for another server. Team co worker and team customer. Spoiled my whole meal and appetite.\nOh and food was horrible. Ordered the farm raised chicken, seared scallops and potato leek soup(which was ok).  Only 3 parties at 11:30pm at night. Eventhough we came late, they should of still had their establishment together. \nRobert needs to work on better customer solution with conflicts. He didn't know how to make things better. It appeared that he was on employees side (team employee) but he shouldn't make it that obvious. Customers come first\n\n\nThe staff do not have it together here. The ambiance looks great but some of the workers create an ugly atmosphere. Plenty of places to eat in Vegas besides this establishment."

Steak frites -  fries were good - the steak tasted like it was seasoned with taco seasoning.  I didn't know French food was seasoned with taco seasoning.  The meat was good - tender - juice - but tasted like taco.  The croque madame  was delicious.  It came with a side of homestyle breakfast potatoes.  What they failed to mention was that they put bell peppers in their homestyle potatoes.  One of us is allergic to bell peppers and so we had to send those back.  Luckily, they were kind about switching the potatoes for fries.  They did not remove anything from the bill.  What got my goat was they said they had a credit card processing had crashed and therefore would not be able to accept credit cards as part of the payment.  This restaurant is connected to the Palazzo and Venetian and has that open tab capability so that hotel patrons are able to charge their purchases to the room.  The way the waiter and manager presented the situation was that the whole hotel's system had crashed along with their own and so charging it to the room was not an option.  First, they could accept credit cards if they were manually entered.  Okay, one of us trekked back up to the room and got our discover card.  Then, magically the discover card could not be processed either when they tried putting it through.  Can you pay with visa or cash? No, no I cannot.  Are you serious right now?  We paid in cash - which is not something I wanted to do because that money$ was set aside for gambling not for paying for food that was supposed to be charged to my room or my credit card.  I call the hotel guest services to see if there's an issue with the whole system at the hotel - guess what- NO IT'S NOT!!  It was just the restaurant's malfunction.  Had I known that - I WOULD HAVE NEVER STAYED - why would you misconstrue the situation - making it seem like it is the whole system in the hotel and not just your restaurant?  That's some shady business.  You made me resent my whole dining experience because I felt bamboozled into eating at a place that was going to give me glorified tacos and allergic reactions - then make me feel bad for not wanting to pay cash because their system is broken.  Blah - not worth a return visit.  Buyer beware !"

Good choice!\n\nIt's a very classy place, with clean, classic decor, nice art on the walls, dim lighting. The modern glowing green Exit signs were the only thing that detracted from the very nice appearance of the place. Walking in you pass the fresh seafood on ice by the bar, and then their cheese area and charcuterie.\n\nThe cheese and wine menus are both extensive and both come from all over the world. I chose a glass of white wine to start. In order to save ourselves the trouble of picking out cheese, we just went with the cheese fondue (though they had a cheese expert that I'm sure would have been happy to help us with our cheese orders, had we asked). I'm quite happy with that choice, as the fondue was excellent.\n\nThe entrees were equally delicious. I had the brick chicken, which was incredibly tasty. It was probably the best meal I had on that trip to Vegas. My friend reported that his wet aged steak was very good as well. The frites with truffle mayonaisse were also good. If you are a steak connoisseur with money to burn, they have Japanese Wagyu steak for $185.\n\nI was too stuffed for dessert so I didn't get to try that.\n\nDespite having a 3-man team dedicated to serving us (and I counted 7 people that brought us food or interacted with us, excluding the hostess) the service wasn't quite as attentive as I would have expected. It wasn't bad by any means, but we had to wait a bit for someone to take our orders, and sometimes for water refills. It was certainly not enough to keep me from going back there.\n\nPrices... well, it's Vegas, and a restaurant in a hotel on the strip. What do you expect? The prices were about on par with the location and the caliber of the restaurant.\n\nOne other thing, they have a nice patio area above the strip overlooking Treasure Island. Unfortunately it was a cool, extremely windy night so we didn't get to enjoy it."

An otherwise good and respectable brand, this particular restaurant is not only sub-par to its other locations, but very below average when it comes to restaurants in Las Vegas. \n\nLet's start with the food. When I order a $62 steak (their Prime corn fed beef Rib Eye sans sides) I expect it to be awesome. Not OK. Not Mediocre. But simply awesome. It wasn't worth the money I spent on it. I could have gone to a real steak house (aka. Cut, Del Monico, Morton's, Mastros, ..), spent less money and gotten a better steak. The steak was blend not cooked medium-rare as I ordered. Too bad no service personnel was around to help me out, which leads me to the next chapter of disaster.\n\nOver the course of the dinner, I must have dealt with 4 to 5 difference waiter and waitresses. There were long absences where nobody was around to help us out. I knew something was off whey they seat you at the worst table in the house (that table next to a busy door), when the restaurant is half empty and stayed so throughout the dinner. They messed the oysters I ordered, forgot the wine, and disappeared on us. \n\nLastly, what's almost the worst part, is management does not care the restaurant is falling apart at so many levels. On my way out, I happened to bump into a manager and briefly alerted him about my experience. I wasn't looking for a refund or a voucher, I had already paid at the time. The gentleman just did not care about the lack of quality and shrugged it off.\n\nLas Vegas has tons of great restaurants. It has many great steak houses - stick with what you know if you want to spend some good money and skip Morels."

Not being Vegas neophytes we didn't expect prices to be inexpensive, but info online indicated a good steak for $35 - $50. \n\nWe arrive around 8PM and are seated promptly. We are greeted right away and our waiter, Paul, was all over us pushing us to order right away. As we're reviewing the menu and prices, plus the cheese list, we figure out that the steaks start at $55 and go up from there. Guess you can't believe everything on the Net.  \n\nWe ordered cheese so we could decide what else to have and ordered drinks. The drinks took a while to arrive; our waiter, who a short time before had been all over us trying to get us to order, now seemed to have no time for us, even though the dining room was not even 1/3 full.\n\nSoon, a party of about 10 businessmen is seated near us. We three women become invisible. A dining experience that started off a little odd went thoroughly downhill from there. We weren't expense-account businesspeople, didn't order lots of very expensive wine and cocktails, didn't order expensive steaks. Having been in the business, I know how waiters think:  3 women, not spending much = poor tip. \n\nPaul:  your tip would have been great had you not decided that we weren't worth your time.\n\nWe ordered a drink that never came, waited an hour for entrees, had empty beer bottles on our table - certainly not service that lived up to the high prices. I complained to Paul the waiter, who then declined to look at us again until time to drop the check. He did send the manager over who apologized, comped a round of drinks and bought dessert. In the meantime, entrees arrive, and the salmon entree one of us ordered was inedible. So we sent it back and declined to re-order, figuring it would take another hour and 1/2 for any more food to arrive. Paul the waiter decided he could talk to us again after the manager gave us dessert and more drinks, but by then the damage was done.\n\nFolks, I give this one a \"don't even bother\".

At a restaurant of supposedly this caliber, that is a big faux pas.  The manager then proceeded to try to convince us to drink it anyway - and explained that it was their last bottle and the other comparable ones are too expensive for them to honor the price they quoted us.  We had to send back our steaks once because they came before we even had our first glass of white (apperitif) delivered.  Our steaks came before our wine, and we had to ask for silverware.  Again, this would be fine at an Outback Steakhouse, but you shouldn't have to micromanage waiters at an upscale steakhouse to bring knives and plates.  To Add insult to injury, the filet mignonette came with a slightly astringent and gritty \"dry rub\" of \" a ton of ingredients\" including rosemary, cumin and cayenne pepper.  At $52/8oz filet that is not what you expect at a steakhouse.  At a minimum you should indicate the spice blend on the menu (waiter confirmed it is not mentioned).

It was easy to get reservations, and we got seated promptly.  From there it all went downhill.  It took about 15 minutes just for the waiter to bring us menus.  After that, another 15 minutes to get water and order.  The restaurant was pretty empty at this point too.  After we ordered, we waited about another 15 minutes until we asked for some bread.  They decided to bring out the butter, but no bread.  15 minutes later, here comes the bread.\n\nWe finally get our steaks.  I ordered mine rare, and to be honest it was a little too rare, but it was still edible.  Someone in my party also ordered rare, and the steak was literally raw.  After eating about half of the horribly cooked steak, we finally had the waiter bring it back to actually get cooked to rare.  Get it back, it's still too rare.  So we sent it back again, and this time when it comes back they plate it on a small bread plate instead of the normal dinner sized plate.  So all in all, it took them three tries to cook a steak to rare, and it still wasn't cooked that well.\n\nWe were already pretty upset because the service had been super slow, and they couldn't cook a steak right.  Somehow, it gets even worse.  We get the bill and we all pull out credit cards to pay.  Morels isn't the cheapest place, we had to spend close to $80 a person for our steak and sides.  The waiter comes over to inform us that they can only have 3 credit cards on the bill.  3 credit cards?!  Are you kidding me?  At a restaurant in the Palazzo/Venetian, where a steak costs at least $50, and you're going to tell us as we start to pay that you can only use 3 credit cards on the bill?  The reasoning?  They say it's not built into their software to be able to use more than 3 cards.  BS.\n\nWe had to ask for a manager.  The experience had just been horrible, and not being able to use as many cards as you want for the bill is inexcusable, especially for a more upscale steakhouse in a hotel where every other restaurant can take more than three credit cards.  How are they going to expect everyone to be able to fork out close to $100 in cash?  In a casino.  Where you could easily lose all of that money and only have a credit card.\n\nWe asked to speak to a manager.  The manager just stood there agreeing with everything we said, saying he's only been there for a month and that for some reason, he's able to put in 5 credit cards instead of the 3 that the waiter can do.  I'm not quite sure why he's all of a sudden allowed to use 5 instead of 3, when apparently it wasn't built into their system to use more than 3 cards.  Absolutely ridiculous.\n\nAll in all, the food wasn't that great, they couldn't cook a steak, and not splitting the bill to however many credit cards you want is absolutely ridiculous in a Las Vegas upscale steakhouse.  I'd give it a 0 star if I could.  Horrible, never coming back, and you shouldn't go either.\n\nAnd the other thing, this review is probably going to get taken down which is a load of BS.  I know at least three other people in my party wrote a review telling about this horrible night, and Morels was able to delete it.  I might just save this copy and check every day and keep re-posting this review.  This place was that bad."

Not my top 5 and not that one-of-a-kind service I've experienced before, but the food was decent and sure, I'd go back...that is, once I've tried every other restaurant Vegas has to offer. :)"

Our server, friendly and attentive, gave us several delicious fromage recommendations to accompany our charcuterie platter.\n\nFour of us decided to share our meals, of which we decided on the Petit Cut Filet Mignon, the Bone In \"Eye\" of the Rib Eye Steak, the Halibut special, and Seafood linguine, with sides of truffle mac & cheese and sauteed green beans in foie gras butter. Everything was so delicious and we weren't even able to finish it all. The meats were tender and flavorful while the seafood was fresh and very delicate in texture and taste. The accompaniments were rich and ever so buttery good. I ate more than I should have and was very happy to be wearing my non-form fitting dress that evening. \n\nAt $86 per person, for one cocktail, appetizers, and one meal per person, split 8 ways for 9 girls is not bad at all. The food was heaven, the dining experience was enjoyable and what locked in our 'large party' reservation was that we weren't subject to a pre-fixe menu, just because our group was larger than 6 people. \n\nMorels was friendly, personable, accommodating and lent their establishment to us for a great meal. I would come back for a second visit for sure."

After our meal was selected, it was like a drag race to the end! Good service is being attentive, but definitely not rushed.  Since every table gets 3 people for service, you'd think table conversation would be great between the 3. Wrong!! Not even one of them made us feel welcomed. I think since there were three, each one assumed the other was taking care of us,  3 = 0 at this point. Overall, I would not return to this restaurant. The worst experience you can have at a restaurant is the feeling of unwelcome. Seriously, I would have rather spent double the money in a restaurant that knows this.

The last one is not something I enjoy, but that's just how it is in Vegas. At Morel's, high prices was the only expectation of mine they met. \n\nLet's start with ambiance:\nNothing luxurious, fancy, or pretty about it. Boring. \n\nFood:\nAll average and pretty tasteless. Not worthy of the prices whatsoever. We were a party of 14 (3 of them being kids) and not one person liked their food. At a price tag of over $1500, that's a sucky way to start a Vegas trip. My salmon was dry and tough, the steaks undercooked and flavorless, and the sides extremely flavorless. Even the mac and cheese just tasted like pasta off the kids menu with some butter and Parmesan. \n\nService:\nA huge disappointment. The busboys were extremely attentive with refilling waters so there's a plus. The hostesses were straight up mean and were gossiping about us, in front of us. Um you're a restaurant not bouncers at a club. You should be pleasant. Our waiter was incredibly rude and just didn't seem to care at all. 2 seconds after I ordered my cocktail I decided I wanted wine. Annoying I know, but it was a quick change of heart. The waiter pretended to check with the bar and said they already made the drink. How do we know he pretended? We saw him!!! Not a huge deal, but lots of little things like that plus a rude attitude and it equals no beuno service. \n\nOverall, not recommended. Much better out there."

We were all very hungover and we're dying for a good cure in brunch but unfortunately, we left with something to be desired.  We all got different things and everyone had complaints about their food.  A couple people received the wrong orders and everyone's food was less than \"yum\".  People who ordered medium rare burgers got well done on stale looking broiche.  The \"most popular brunch item\"- the crab omelette, was dry and tasteless.  My turkey club sandwich required a bunch of salt, pepper, and ketchup because it was completely void of all flavor.  Also, it was supposed to come with avocado which was missing when I got it- when I pointed it out to the waitress, she left and while I thought she was getting me a new sandwich, she was actually just getting me half an avocado instead.  Glad I paid $15 for a bland sandwich with ingredients on the side so I could make it myself.  But not gonna lie- I squeezed my iced tea lemon on the avocado and added some salt to it and that ended up being the tastiest part of my whole meal.  And the fries were good too but I'm not sure how you could really go wrong with fries anyway.  \n\nThen there was the service.  We were stuck paying an 18% gratuity due to the size of our group but that's certainly not the type of service we received.  Considering this is a fairly nice restaurant and food wasn't cheap, I thought service would be better.  The waitress was clearly over us and annoyed. Our tab was off by $80 and it was taking awhile for us to figure it out and that irked her too.  Yes we were there for a couple hours but the restaurant was almost empty so what did it matter?\n\nWish we'd gone to the place in the Paris instead!"

The service is pleasant, the view of the Strip is serviceable (much better at night because it's right across the pirate show at Treasure Island), and the food very reasonably priced for Palazzo standards (lunch for 2 with 2 drinks each is only 100). The problem is that Morel's does nothing to distinguish itself from the overcrowded bistro market in Vegas. Even in the Palazzo/Venetian it's going up against Bouchon and Pinot Brassiere, not t speak of the other bistros all around the strip (Payard, Mon Ami Gabi.. the list goes on). As a result the restaurant is almost always empty: the last time I was here for brunch there were only 6 more guests in the patio and none inside. For a restaurant that does much OK (service, food, prices) it's hard to write a good review because it is just fine in all categories but superb in none. If you are at the Palazzo for lunch you could certainly do a lot worse but be assured that you could do much better within only a 10 minute walking distance. You won't be disappointed with your meal but you probably won't remember it the next day either."

Although the fondue appetizer was excellent, the steak I ordered (a $67 filet minion) came out cold.  Ice cold. Like it was in a refrigerator..... cold.  Weird. When I reordered the steak, it came rare (instead of medium as ordered) 20 minutes later. I just don't understand it.  After two swings and two misses I decided to call it quits and asked for my check rather than wait another 20 minutes for another steak.  To make matters worse, the manager didn't come out to say anything, he left the waiter (from another table) explaining and apologizing to me (my waiter had disappeared). Then, when I specifically requested the manager, I waited almost 15 minutes for him to appear.  I think I have a good idea where the problem is here.  Great product, great servers, but really crappy management.  I'm not sure what to say here because I really wanted to like Morels, but there are two things you must do when charging almost $70 for a steak. It must be hot and it must be the right temperature. Also, in a place like this, if a customer has a problem, the manager should be out immediately solving the issue. Morels misses on both of these points. It's clear to me that this manager was not interested in his customers or his team's performance. Very sadly, I give Morels 1 star and advise them to find new management.  I am sincerely disappointed."

For $22 !\n\nAll was prepared fine and tasted fine, but it's not breakfast service. \n\nFor starts they only give you one little slice of thin toast (cut in two). Asked for a second slice and they charged $2.50.  By the time it came out, I had finished - they still charged. \n\nNo salt and pepper on the table. Ok for other meals, but for breakfast they should be on the table. \n\nNo butter, no jam. \n\nProbably good for there meals ... Go elsewhere for breakfast."

I'm not a big fan of French food because I've had bouchon and mon ami gabi here in Vegas and both was really bad. No flavor and oily. I decided to give this place a shot with no expectations and it wasn't as bad as I thought. \n\nI had lunch here with my boyfriend and his parents, so we ordered family style. \n\nNi\u00e7oise Salad- first time ever trying a French salad and this was so good. The Ni\u00e7oise salad had seared yellowfin and anchovies with quail egg dressed with summer vinaigrette. I was completely taken by surprise and it was way better than my Cobb Salad. 4/5\n\nFlat iron steak & frites. Frites are fries, just a fancier way of saying it I guess. They were fried to crisp perfection and not too overdone. Steak was surprisingly good. Not the best but not bad coming from a French spot. It was a light season of a simple recipe of rosemary and salt and pepper with a nice tender. 4/5 \n\nSeafood Platter- west coast oysters, dungness crab claws, and humongous cocktail shrimp. Great appetizer if you're willing to dish out for it. Oysters were okay.. Not sweet as I expected since it's suppose to be. Other than that, everything else was delicious, even the Italian aioli they made in house for the crab was great. 4/5\n\nSeared Scallops with Cous Cous- perfectly Sears scallops. Light white butter sauce. Not a fan of Cous Cous though. Scallops would've been good either by itself or accompanied with a greenie. \n3.5/5\n\nSeafood Fettuccini- light pasta dish. Clams, shrimp, mussel, garlic, and Chardonnay white sauce. My Boyfriend didn't like it because he likes creamy based sauce. This dish isn't meant to be like those heavy Italian dishes. Not bad but not omg good.  3/5 \n\nCobb Salad- huge portion. Couldn't finish. But the dressing had WAY too much vinegar. 2/5 \n\nOverall this place was good. But if it weren't for the $150 Credit, i wouldn't come back because it's really expensive."

Desperate for food before noon and wanting something other than Italian or new American. Default to Morel's since we were staying at the Palazzo.  A steakhouse, a French steakhouse. No expectations and not wanting steak.   Could be a disastrous choice. But French star chef cannot be too bad a choice.  Bouchon made us beleivers in French with American sensibilities. Not seeking an experience, just lunch.   \nShe had the Slow Roasted Turkey Club and I was torn between 2 choices: Seafood Fettucini(me not wanting Italian but a sucker for anything seafood) or the Pork and Veal Meatloof. Our waiter said the Meatloaf for sure.  Done.   A paired glass of red, chosen by our server again.   A sandwich is a sandwich. But this one was memorable in its taste, freshness and the play of ingredients. The bread, Campagne , sliced thin was just the right handle and carb. Meatloaf is meatloaf.  Ground meat. Simple.  Well Morel's creation was a revelation. Texture, taste, finess of flavours accompanied by silky Youkon Gold Potato Puree aka mashers.   Wow.  If you do ketchup with meatloaf this one doesnot need any condiments to make it sing.\n\nHow the simple, unassuming plates are done speaks volumes of the chef's ability. Nothing overdone. Just ordinary crafted into extraordinary.\n\nTrusting our server  who could have suggested the higher priced Fettucini and any possible higher priced glass of wine, gives me confidence in a 2nd visit.\n\nUnplanned, no expectations often rewards with a new discovery that must be renewed on another visit."

All i can say is that I was really disappointed and ended up feeling a little sick for the rest of the night.  We called in advance to see if they could do something special for her birthday (like a dessert, etc. that said Happy Birthday) and they immediately told us that they didn't comp any desserts but that they could do something on a dessert we chose (which we agreed to).  \n\nThe service was a worse than what I had expected and the food was definitely worse than expected.  3 of us ordered the salmon and my other friend and I ordered the short rib.  I heard the salmon was a little undercooked and underwhelming.  The short rib was a huge disappointment - it was very dry and while it was tender, it didn't really go down very well.  I even had to ask for more sauce in hopes of ameliorating the situation, but the sauce didn't help that much.  The mac and cheese was delicious - maybe the best part of my meal.\n\nWe ordered two desserts to share all around and we even went to remind our waiter to do write happy birthday on at least one of the desserts and we were assured that they were taking care of it.  The two desserts came and none of them had any writing on it.  Then after we were eating for 5 minutes, a third dessert came out with a candle.  It was a pistachio souffle and we were all surprised at how nice it looked.  Until the bill came and they ended up charging us for it even though we didn't order it.\n\nThe bill ended up coming out late and after we wrote clear instructions on how to split the bill four ways, there was a lot of confusion and it was clear that they ran our cards a couple of times before figuring out exactly how to charge a specific amount.\n\nAll in all, I was really disappointed with the service and the quality of food -- definitely wouldn't come back here."

Then we waited another 30 minutes for a piece of bread. One of the steaks that we ordered was raw in the middle and took them 2 times to re-fire the steak to get it to a rare center. I went with a group of 10, so when we went to pay the check, we attempted to split it on our credit cards. We were then told they could only split it on 3 cards. The reason I was given is that each transaction costs a fee, so they only allow 3 cards. Each dish we ordered was $60+ with sides, drinks, tax, and gratuity on top of that. Ridiculous to say a transaction fee on at least an $80 charge was the reason why they would not allow us to use more credit cards. After arguing for a while, they then claimed the system would not allow more than 3 cards to be used at a single table. That again was a lie because later on a waiter came over who overheard and told us he knew how to pay the bill with 5 credit cards. We had to call a manager over who again said the system only allows 3 cards. After a round of arguments, we got it all settled.\n\nIt took over 45 minutes to just pay the bill. The whole dinner was a waste of my time and I will never go back to Morels. Too bad 0 stars is not an option on yelp reviews."

Quickly following were Wild Caught Prawns that were cold and meaty, and a Horseradishy Cocktail Sauce.  My other preliminary course was a crock of excellent sweet Onion Soup Gratinee with a large and well-deconstructed crouton and well-melted Comte and Gruyere Cheeses.\n\nBoth of us then enjoyed the night's featured Surf & Turf Special of Filet and Half-Lobster.  We each received a very nice lobster half and a nicely seasoned 8 oz. Filet with little char cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered.  The lobster meat was sweet dipped in either drawn butter or specially requested Buerre Blanc, and ran out just a few bites ahead of the Filet.  Excellent whipped Mashed Potatoes accompanied the combo entree.  Three flavored sea salts were also provided: Black Hawaiian Sea Salt, Smoked Black Sea Salt, and Red Hawaiian Sea Salt.\n\nWe finished with very good Classic Profiteroles served with Candied Vanilla Almond Ice Cream and Malted Chocolate Sauce.  I just wish there had been more ice cream.\n\nOur booth back was hard but seating was otherwise comfortable, with a nice cushioned bottom.  Sensually appealing fine art adorned several walls.\n\nService was excellent except for tea sweeteners initially being removed prematurely.  Chamomile Decaf Iced Tea was specially made for me, with needed refills quickly supplied without request.

Everything was off to a great start...the entrance/grand lobby of the Palazzo (impressive), the very nice and laid-back environment (sure beats the crap animation show and music at the SW), the excellent service, the 3 fantastic bottles of wine (sommelier's choice), the oyster/lobster appetizers, excellent side dishes...I was ready to chalk it up as a 5.  They got everything right so far, and heck, all they have to do is serve a decent steak.  Then I got the Kansas City steak (essentially their NY steak)......it was horrendous.  They didn't cook it properly.....asked for medium rare, and this could barely pass as a suitable rare (I know, I know, some people ask for a cold middle).....we're talking 85% red-pink and 5% grey.  I finished about 2 bites, but  I'm not one to complain, and besides, I'm not going to return the steak and have them use their special sauce (I wasn't feeling too hungry anyways).  But at the end of the meal, I let our server know.....another member of our party criticized his steak as well (too charbroiled.....at a place like this, wtf?  Not as bad as mine, but still crap).  Our server took our steaks away to show the chef.  I've been to places where they would take the steak off the bill...fine not both, but maybe one.  I could really care less about the money...it's the whole principle of it, you know?  Either way, we weren't the only table complaining......the table right next to us, this older gentleman sent back his steak as soon as he took his first bite.\n\nEither way, everything but the steak was just fine.  But it's a steakhouse...they're not supposed to mess up.  The chef did give us tiny little cookies afterwards (\"on the house\").  What class.  But the reason why I'm not giving this place 1 star is because the other members of my party enjoyed their meals.\n\nI must admit I have been spoiled by the fine steakhouses in the Bay Area, CA.  But I would have expected more from Morels.  My best guess is that if I go there again, I'll probably have a great steak.  But first impressions are also important......"

As you walk through the entrance of the restaurant you can smell all the delicious cheeses that are displayed in the cheese case. Our waiter was Chandler. He was \"awesome!\"  Upon his suggestion I ordered a glass of \"Sin Quan\" . He informed me that it is a hard to find wine that was opened by mistake and not normally served by the glass. The wine and beer list is impressive and that always makes for a good night! My husband had several different rare beers after starting with his favorite \"go to beer\" (Chimay) That was served in the correct glass. (Thank you!) \n\nShrimp Cocktail : Fabulous! Really fresh; Chilled to perfection; Beautifully presented. The only thing that could have made it slightly better for me is a lemon wedge.\n\n French Onion Soup : Jeff loved it! \n\nBaby Iceberg salad : I ordered with no bacon. Really crisp and tasty. I really liked the sun dried tomatoes. \nAsked for salt and was presented with a variety of three. I have never seen this before and thought it was a great touch.\n\nFilet: Cooked perfectly rare; Juicy\n\nMushrooms: Nice size portion for two; So tasty; One of my favorite things! \n\nMac and Cheese: None for me but my husband said it was good. Not to rich; not to cheesy; Again nice size portion\n\nFor our Cheese course we chose a variety of three after telling our server what we liked in our cheeses he did very well with suggestions. The cheese monger presented the cheeses and was very nice. We had a Mimolette/cows milk from france, Cashel Blue/cows milk from Ireland and the \"most stinky but interesting cheese I have yet to experience The Grayson/cows milk from Virgina US. My husband and I were impressed and pleased with the selection. \n\nOverall I would say this was a wonderful experience. I haven't had such impeccable service in way to long. I could say that the service was 5 star all the way! The managers were warm and friendly even serving us our entrees. The staff was knowledgeable and fun and encouraged us to take our time and enjoy!!! \nThe decor of Morels is a little dull. I could see how it would fly in LA but in Las Vegas you expect a bit more due to the fact that everything is on a  grander scale here. I think sitting on the patio on a warm night would be a whole different story but as far the inside it just lacked that \"little extra something\" I hate to even say a negative thing about this place because I would most certainly  recommend Morels to anyone. We loved it and had a fantastic evening It was memorably fabulous!!!"

The shrimp and tuna were no different. Good for one, but sharing is optional.\nThe meal? Pretty much everyone ordered steak, as you do at a steakhouse.For me, I ordered a bone-in ribeye. After I ordered, found out they didn't have it. Ordered the prime ribeye. \nThen we waited. For literally an hour. I think they forgot to put it in and then realized their failure. Why? Out of 10 steaks ordered, 3 were done properly. I ordered medium rare and it was purple on the inside. One ordered well and it was bright pink. Medium well came out medium rare if they were lucky; it was bordering rare. I think they forgot, slapped them on the grill quick, plated and sent them. For a $65 steak, it should be perfect. And the sides? Small, one person sides and overdone. The brussel sprouts were basically black.\nWe had a better meal the night before at the burger place near the food court. Avoid this place."

(Tables weren't cleared yet)  Service great.  Decor great.  Atmosphere ok - Could hear loud music blaring from sports bar beneath.  Menu was brunch focused.  Fondue decent.  Lobster ravioli did not have much sauce and pasta was dried out on the edges.  Skirt steak decent.  Bread distribution at tables seemed random. (we did not get any - but did not ask).  Wine good - lots of selection.  Overall, I expect more from a place where average entree  prices are $22ish...  Restaurant is riding on \"Top 10 best restaturants in Vegas\" from 2008.  Will not return."

Initially, we didn't go in because upon peering into the reception area, we could see a crowded and messy store room across from the hostess' station. We thought they were under construction so we walked away. However, we liked the menu and walked in. \n\nWe had a couple of very attentive and professional wait staff checking in on us throughout the night. We had the bib salad with crab meat, which was delicious. The dozen oysters were exceptional. The cocktails were imaginative and addictive. We had the halibut, accompanied by various side dishes. Again, they were properly cooked and seasoned. \n\nThe restaurant is beautifully decorated with dramatic black chandeliers. The wine list is extensive. If I had one minor complaint, it was a few staff members brushing against my chair several times during dinner. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this restaurant for the food, service, friendly hostesses, and overall ambiance. For two people, dinner including wine and cocktails was about $250 before gratuity. Now, if only they'll close the door behind them when accessing the store room."

I stuck to the prefixe while she ordered off of the regular menu. \n\nCALAMARI APP: Crispy with a mix of rings and baby octopus, served wtih lemon and marinara. Nice start to the meal.\nGREEK SALAD: Nice plating, lots of olives and minimal romaine, but it worked. Generous amount of feta, liked the dressing.\nCROQUE MONSIEUR: Baked ham and cheese sandwich with mornay sauce. A classic, well-executed French lunch dish. The sauce makes this especially indulgent, but I appreciated that the bread didn't get soggy as with other versions. Served with frites.\nSTEAK FRITES: Large hangar steak, cooked to medium rare and extremely tender, could cut with a fork. Frites were salty and crispy, flavorful enough to render the ketchup unnecessary.\nVANILLA CREME BRULEE: Large, shareable portion. Bethany E is off sugar and I'm not much of a dessert person, and we were both full, so we barely touched this but it was quite good. The fresh whipped cream was my favorite part, sugar crust was minimal.\n\nService was friendly, we were helped by a sweet older gentleman whose name I did not catch. Courses came out a bit slowly but company was good so we didn't mind at all, and they did ask if we were in a hurry. Good lunch with a good friend, would come back- there's a table you can reserve right next to the cheese counter that would be fun to sit at to watch the kitchen!"

            "review": "Well, we should've gone to Bouchon. \n\nI met up with a friend at Morels for breakfast. Lately, we've been on a French food kick and have been breakfasting at various French restaurants; Morels was next on our list. Essentially, it's a 2-Star dining establishment that can be ranked alongside Denny's and Ihop. I'm not insulting those establishments, but why would anyone pay good money for that kind of food? If I wanted Denny's, I would've gone there. The food was definitely not worth the caloric intake and the cash withdrawal from my wallet, but at least Morels will never receive business from me again.\n\nMarket Fresh Seasonal Fruit ($11): \"Market Fresh\", yeah right, far from it. The plate consisted of a mix of melons, several pineapple slices, a SINGLE strawberry that was sliced up for us to share, and some random blueberries for \"garnish.\" In the center of the plate was a bowl of plain yogurt. We also received some honeycomb that was less than a teaspoon.\n\nFree Range Egg Crab Omelette ($19): I chose this over the Croque Madame, which I originally wanted to try; however, I can't say if sticking to my original decision would've changed my experience. The omelette comes with a choice of either a house salad or Country Breakfast Potatoes. I'm not exaggerating when I say that my entire meal was bland. I even had my friend try some of my food to make sure my taste buds were functioning. Both my potatoes and omelette desperately needed seasoning. I don't like adding salt and pepper to the food that I order, but this could've been the first restaurant meal where I was about to do so, except we didn't have any salt and pepper on our table. I did request some Dijon mustard. That somewhat added some life to my meal, but Dijon wasn't suited for it. On a positive note: there was real crab meat in my omelette. \n\nCrab Eggs Benedict ($20) This was what my friend ordered. The presentation of her dish almost made me regret having ordered my omelette, but it was all looks. Her order was also flavorless and lacked seasoning. \n\nCosta Rican Pressed Coffee ($5): Decent for being a $5 cup 'o joe. It's robust and had more flavor than what I ate.\n\nThe service is in need of improvement, and it isn't up to the quality I'd expect from a dining establishment at The Palazzo. We should've considered the chair with the hole in its back, and the awkwardness of the service staff -- specifically, the busser, who lurked around our table.\n\nLastly, if you make an Open Table reservation, double check that you're awarded your dining points. Morels failed to add 100 points to my account. \n\nI said it in the beginning of this review, and I'll say it again: We should've gone to Bouchon."

            "review": "Quick Look: Quality restaurant w/ some flaws that need to be addressed by management. One of the best raw seafood bar's in the city. \n\nIn Depth Review: We are local Las Vegas foodies and enjoy the fine restaurants in this city on a regular basis. Had Morel's on my list for a long time. Finally had a chance to experience it on a Thursday night in April of 2015. It was my ladies birthday and we wanted Oysters/Shell-Fish. We found Morel's by doing some research online. We made a reservation for 8:30pm. Requested a private booth. When we arrived the booths were full and we were advised to grab a drink at the bar. We were OK with that. \n\nHere is where we ran into major issue #1 - \n\nWent to the bar and ordered two Hendrinks gin and tonics w/ lime.  We were informed they were out of Hendrinks (and all top shelf gins). We thought the barkeep was joking. He informed us that they had a private event a few nights earlier, said they were gin drinkers & cleared them out. Shocked by this response as I know that most quality Vegas establishments will restock quickly after such an event. In addition, they can always borrow from another bar/restaurant they have a relationship with inside the hotel. Finally, they can borrow from the massive inventory the hotel keeps on hand at all times. \n\nThe bartender was named Brandon and he was very nice and friendly. He made some great suggestions for alternative drinks. We were bummed that we could not enjoy some quality gin drinks with our food, but he made us feel better about the situation. In addition, he poured us some complimentary birthday glasses of Champagne in honor of my wife's birthday. Classy touch. He's a great asset to this restaurant. \n\n\nAfter a 20 minute wait past our reservation time we were brought to our booth. The restaurant was 60% filled. It was a clean and nice room. Great sight-lines, minimalistic decor (typical French restaurant). Only advice would be to turn the lights down a few notches, it was too bright in the room to create an intimate atmosphere. \n\nOur server identified himself and was super attentive. He knew the menu inside and out and made some killer recommendations. \n\nWe ordered the \"PETIT PLATEAU DE MER,\" which translate into petite platter of seafood. It consisted of 4 Shrimp, 6 Oysters, Octopus Ceviche &  1/2 Dungeness Crab. The cost was $60. Well worth it for the freshness we received. It was delicious. I will go out on a limb and say this was one of the freshest raw seafood platters in Vegas. I highly suggest you order this if you go to Morels.\n\nFor our appetizer we ordered \"CHEF'S PRIME BEEF TENDERLOIN TARTARE.\" It consisted of Quail Egg, Truffled & Potato Chips. It was unique. I could taste some fancy homemade ketchup in the mix. My wife though it had a Chipotle flavor. The server confirmed that they do indeed use a homemade ketchup and mustard when preparing it. It was wet and sticky in texture, not your typical beef tartare. With that said, we enjoyed it. \n\nFor our entrees we ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb ($52) and the 18 Hour Braised Short Rib ($37). As a side we ordered the steamed asparagus ($10). The short rib entree was decent. The meat was a bit dry and over cooked. I have tasted better, for far less money. I did enjoy the fresh bacon pieces on the plate. The Colorado rack of Lamb was good. My wife mentioned it was in the same category as the rack of lamb at every other god restaurant in the city. But at $52 it was higher priced than than those other restaurants. You would expect to have a superior cut and plate at that price point. The asparagus was as expected, tasted good. Think both entrees were also good, just not amazing. \n\nHere is another area of opportunity for the management to improve upon. Clean up and fix your confusing wine list. It was on white printed computer paper, hole punched and put in a cheap binder. The first three pages were dirty and had been torn from the rings of the binder. The wine list was almost impossible to read. Not sure who designed this, or who approved it's use? It's not a quality look at all. I will attach some pics so you can address it. We were ordering $20+ glasses of wine from a menu that looked like something you would find at the local diner. \n\nWe ordered the ice cream as a desert. It was a delicious ending. They put a candle in the desert for her birthday. Nice touch. \n\n\nIn summary: We spent almost $400 for a birthday dinner experience at a fine dining restaurant. The service was fantastic. The raw shell fish platter was superb. Unfortunately the entrees were mediocre. The wine list confusing. The bar not fully stocked. Not the 5 star experience we had hoped / paid for. Few tweaks and Morel's can be a top contender."

I looked up a few restaurants to see who had a seared foie gras on their menu, and I was happily surprised that Morels had it, especially since we were staying at Palazzo. How convenient! I called the restaurant on Thursday to make sure they will have foie gras on Friday and they said yes.\n\nWe didn't get in to Vegas 'til really late Friday night, our dinner reservation was at 9:30pm. The moment I sat down and saw the seared foie gras on their menu, I knew I was in for a treat. To my dismay, when I was ready to order, our waiter informs me that they were out! Really?! You're out of foie gras??? He says that they sell so much on a daily basis, especially to Californians. Uh, hello?! That's me!! He went back to the kitchen and confirmed that they were out 'til Monday! Seriously?! The chef did NOT plan the menu accordingly. How can you run out of such a 'hot' item, especially right before a busy weekend? I couldn't believe it. My 4.5hr drive was a waste. My weekend was already off to a bad start. I was devastated. \n\nIf I had known they had such a limited supply, I would have dined elsewhere."

I intended to go to breakfast but since breakfast service ends at 11:00 am I had to settle for lunch. We dined inside. It was very pretty inside but kind of dull since there were only a couple other diners. The steak frites and fish and chips were excellent. Service was very attentive. I returned a month later early enough to catch breakfast. I had the banana stuffed French toast. It was perfect, crispy on top and soft inside. My party also enjoyed the seasonal fruit, with a side of bagels and organic bacon. The fruit was fresh and came with vanilla yogurt to dip. The mini bagels had a wonderful chive cream cheese spread. The bacon was crispy. Again, delicious food and great service. This time I also sat outside facing the south strip. I found this to be way more lively and fun than sitting inside the restaurant so I'd recommend doing that. Even though it is summer outdoor seating provides plenty of shade so we were very comfortable the whole time. Thank you Morels!"

We were in town to watch GNR at The Joint, and I wanted to find a nice restaurant to celebrate my husband's birthday.  I read some of the reviews and was slightly apprehensive, but I took the plunge and made the reservations.  \n\nAlthough we were 30 minutes late, the hostess quickly sat us.  As other people have mentioned, the dining room at Morels is quite beautiful and elegant.  There's no smoking allowed which makes the dining experience that much more pleasant.  The clientele is a diverse mix.  To our right was a couple that was dressed in smart casual clothes (think dinner attire on a cruise).  To our left diagonal was a guy in a t-shirt and jeans with a mullet.  To our right diagonal was a party of 6 dressed in cocktail attire.  So in case you were wondering what the dress code was, it was fairly lenient.\n\nWe had three people helping with our table.  I, unfortunately, can only remember Mike who was the \"captain.\"  He was sensational as was his team.  Service was exemplary.  We never wanted for anything.  \n\nOur evening started out with two piping hot dinner rolls served with olive paste and creamy butter.  Then we were served the soup du jour which was a seafood bisque.  It was described to be similar to a lobster bisque.  The bisque was creamy and just hot enough to sip.  Along with the soup came the bibb lettuce and crab salad as well as the tuna tartare.  It was a very fresh and citrusy salad topped with a subtle and light tarragon dressing.  The combination of the peppers and the sesame oil in the tuna was a perfect ratio, not too overpowering on one side of the flavor palate over the other.  For dinner, my husband ordered a petite filet mignon with a side of country mac & cheese.  Though I didn't taste the pasta, I assume he enjoyed it since there was nothing left in the bowl.  I did, however, taste the filet which was cooked to a perfect medium, slightly pink in the middle with a nice velvety brown coating on the exterior.  It came with a side of bordelaise sauce which was a nice complement to the steak.  I ordered the 18 hour braised short rib.  Just when I thought that The Farm's short rib couldn't be topped, I was proven wrong by the dish that the chef at Morels prepared.  It was tender, had a unique flavor, probably brought on by the lardons of bacon which were part of the dish, and the quality of the beef was superb. We topped off our meal with what can only be described as a mind-blowing dessert:  the hazelnut & gianduja chocolate dome.  Try it and you'll see.\n\nTwo more items on their menu which we found impressive:  they offered Duvel and Chopin.  We dined a several places in town while we were there and nobody had either of those two items on their menu.\n\nLucky for us, there's a Morels closer to home at The Grove so we won't be missing it for very long."

It was her birthday, something we had mentioned on our open table reservation, it would have been nice for them to say happy birthday or attempt to make it a pleasant experience for us. \nWhen we were seated, no one came by to give us menus or water for 10 minutes, despite 3 staff seeing our table. When jerry finally came to our table he was very polite but, unfortunately, he was also very inadequate.  The meal consisted of being ignored, getting up from the table to grab a carafe of water to refill our own glasses, empty plates being left on the table (making it difficult to eat our meal due to lack of table space), never offering refills or quality checking in a timely fashion. The manager came over to ask if we needed anything but we had already refilled our own water, he wasn't very helpful.  My friends chicken entree was so bad she had 2 bites and pushed it away but no one asked if it was ok or why she didn't eat it and so we ended up paying for something we didn't eat. My salad was not bad, it was mediocre.  We were visibly annoyed and were not asked how our meal was.  I can't even believe the poor quality of service.

The front of house was just making a shift change and service was a little slow to get started. We ordered some oysters, of which a few were definitely sad excuses for Kumamotos served to customers at $35+ for a dozen. \n\nWe also got a Caesar for 2 which was a nice table side presentation and no complaints there.  We shared a prime rib eye as our entree and it was a decent steak.  I asked for medium rare and I would say the temperature was a bit uneven with the middle rare and the exterior a bit more well.  Seems like an issue with not letting the steak come to temp before cooking or just a by product of uneven heat in the broiler or pan.  Overall the steak was good though and came with a nice salt selection and a side of sauce bordelaise.  \n\nThe service was mixed as one of our lead servers was great and the other lady was just trying to upsell everything which is always a turnoff.  \n\nCome here if you are at the Palazzo, otherwise there are plenty of other options that are better and more worth your money."

For the main course, I had the Pan Sauteed Sole which was excellent. The accompaniment with the spinach, vegetables, and the SAUCE! Oh my gosh I think the sauce was what made the dish excellent (and of course the fish was perfectly cooked so it's very tender). \n\nMy sister had the steak frites which I thought was great too. She thought it was too well-done and even though I agree with her, the taste was great and because it was a thin steak that it wasn't too tough. \n\nOverall I liked the food and I will definitely return just for the sole if I'm craving for fish. But it's not one of the must. I would probably invest my time in another French restaurant in Vegas. Honestly speaking.. the price for the food and the quality you get might not be equal. So another -1 star there."

We were just at Bouchon the day before this breakfast... granted we hit the peak of lunch time and our waitress was super nice in trying to salvage the deal, but I now believe Bourdain in his comment of \"high class fast food for a price\". Of course after that disappointment I was almost hesitant to shell out some more cash just to be deceived by the glitz and glam of Las Vegas strip restaurants.   But ok, I couldn't help it. The organic eggs and sides woke me up and dragged my two limbs downstairs to fill my empty stomach.   \n\nCame in and the hostess seemed unorganized, but it did take her only five minutes to get our party of five in a comfortable round table In the middle of restaurant.  Decor was very modern and almost sensual in a good way.   I can see how the colors, and the moldings would work beautifully at night with dim lights and not so dragging with a hangover look during the daytime.   Our waiter was great and knowledgeable to a degree.   Coffee selection, I would almost say limited... but then maybe I'd have to correct myself on that one.  It was actually a well chosen selection of the average and exotic brew or should I say press.  Our waiter suggested Rwanda on a French press and it was definitely a cup worth waking up earlier than high noon in sin city.   I thought my order was good, I opted for the crab benedict which was prepared clean and tasty as expected.   But from the whole meal, one thing that was unforgettable was the side of organic ham. Oh that tiny bite of organic ham... I'd like to order a whole hind of it and make it my pillow.   That was by far the juiciest ham I've ever tasted.   That ham will take out your Grandma's holiday ham anytime. Yes, that's right, I'm talking sh$t about your Grandma's dry, chewy and overly sauced ham.   Morels may have to share their secret with me here, becuase that one was perfect. It was salty, sweet, juicy, plump, not chewy, and seared properly on all sides.\n \nAnd so, I can say that Morels offered me and my party a true hearty breakfast.   I just wish for next time they can deliver me a breakfast in bed.  Hey, it is Vegas...  you never know."

Patio seating is available that overlooks Las Vegas Blvd and Treasure Island/Wynn/the mall (corner view). The service was awesome and the food was delicious. We had steaks, pasta and the raw oysters. A plus was that Morel's had a children's menu!! SCORE! You seldom have children's menus at high end places, this helped out as I had my young son with me. Raw oysters ($20 for 1/2 dozen) was super fresh and tasty. My \"prime\" rib eye Bordelaise was good ($66) but a bit over cooked, I asked for medium rare and it was almost medium. Mom's linguini clams was good, the pasta sauce was perfect for dipping the bread and Morel's added tons of clam. \n\nOverall a good dinner with my parents, we all enjoyed Morel's and I would recommend it to others."

            "review": "5-star review for LUNCH ONLY!\nI'm not a huge fan of their dinner, to be honest (mostly because there are so many other better options in this fabulous city).\n\nMy family and I make it a point to dine here for one of our lunches every time we travel to Vegas, which is luckily 5 or so times a year. They have a seasonal menu, but they generally keep their best-sellers. They also have a splendid brunch menu, and with this they serve mini donuts/beignets of a sort, rolled in sugar; when warm, these are like starting the meal with dessert (uh, who said that's a bad thing?)\n\nSo, without further ado, I have three extremely crucial words for you: GET.THE.QUICHE. This is like no other quiche I have had in my life (and I've had my share). It's like they imported it right out of France, because this is to a T exactly how they make it in le Paris. It isn't thick to where the egg takes control over your taste buds...it's so airy and fluffy, but still has the slightest crisp on the outside layer-- you essentially won't have to chew this dish because it's so creamy and fluffy. Embedded throughout this piece of absolute heaven is applewood smoked bacon (the thick cut kind!), perfectly carmelized onions, and a cheese, possibly Gruyere? Deceivingly light, this is one rich piece quiche. It comes with choice of pommes frites or salad, and the fries are on par with some of the better thin fries I've ever had. \n\nNow, for the other options (almost overshadowed by the masterpieceofquiche). The Croque Monsieur is also quite tasty and has just the right amount of ham-layering to cheese ratio. My dad frequently gets the omelets  and they are also worth ordering if you're looking for a more savory option. On normal days, they serve some bread (conjoined twin pieces) with a pesto-like dipping sauce (we also get butter with the Hawaiian sea salt sprinkled across the top as that's what they used to serve..you'll have to request it, probably). \n\nFor dessert, you cannot steer wrong from the sorbet/ice cream selections. With a wiiiide array of flavors, you can get three scoops served in a cross-cookie type of concoction alongside a dollop of whipped cream and strawberry slices. Try the vanilla almond ice cream and the coconut sorbet...Mmmm, palate-cleansing after a flawless meal.  \n\nSteve used to be their best waiter, but he no longer works there. Nevertheless, we've never had any issues with their lunchtime service. GOOO here!"

When we arrived there was no wait and we were given the choice of dining on the patio or inside. Summers in Vegas are no joke, so I was slightly apprehensive about dining al fresco in June, but the patio was nicely shaded and quite comfortable. \n\nService by our waiter Richard was good, he was friendly and did not seem put off by the fact that we were ordering from the RW menu or that we would be sharing our meals. We decided to go with the Classic Benedict for $20 and the Steak Frites for $30, both 3 course meals.\n\nAll of the food we had was well made and tasted great. The fruit was fresh and the greek salad has a delightfully light vinaigrette dressing. Our steak was tender and cooked exactly as we had requested. The benedict was a great portion size for sharing, with yummy smoked ham on brioche. Our third course was desserts; a creamy and decadent cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e as well as a crepe served with chocolate sauce, strawberries, bananas and whipped cream. \n \nThe only issues I had with our meal were minor service related snafus: \n-I would have ordered a Bloody Mary from the cart however at no point was it offered.  \n-The breakfast we selected came with french press coffee, which we had to ask for.\n-Third course came out as we were still very clearly working on the second. \n\nEven with these minor issues, our time at Morels was very enjoyable.

I really enjoyed the personal french press coffee, juevos racheros were tasty, banana and marscopone french toast was as good as you think it was, croque madame was filling, and the service was exceptional. Because I went for breakfast on a weekday it was not busy and I got to sit outside. I actually went there twice in one week. The second time it was a perfect day and our server let us linger for about 2.5 hours and was the perfect amount of attentive without being overbearing. Two things I thought were underwhelming were the sugar doughnuts (just ok, nothing to write home about) and the bloody marys. Yes they make it at your table, but I don't buy into that hype. I don't care if you make it in front of me, in the bar, in the kitchen, or in the back alley if it isn't good. The bloody mary is underwhelming.

I have had lunch here before and do not remember the service being so sub par.\nOverall the food was adequate. Nothing special, and certainly not worth the price, even for Vegas. There are so many other better steakhouses within walking distance.\nIt was the service, and how we were treated by the manager that capped off a miserable night. As we were being seated, I noticed a couple leaving without having ordered, that was the first clue. First, everything  was brought out at the same time. I kid you not. Appetizer, salad, soup, sides, and steak. I wonder if they would have brought out coffee and desert had we put that order in also. I really am not exaggerating. They all came out at the same time without any explanation. However, the person ordering the soup was not given a spoon. After dropping off the food, no one came back by to check on us. We flagged down a busboy after 5 minutes and he went to get a spoon. He must have been distracted as he did not come back, but a few minutes later he dropped off two spoons to the couple next to us who had just ordered. I got up, found our waiter and had a spoon brought over, almost ten minutes after the food was brought out.\nWith the waiter now at our table, we ordered a second round of drinks, only to have a lemon drop spilled on the poor woman who had been forced to wait on the spoon.  After that, the next server who came by was a good 20 minutes clearing our plates. At this time I asked for the manager. One would think he would come over on his own, but then again.\nAfter explaining the situation, he said he would \"tap dance on our bill,\" and commented on \"how nice and easygoing we were with the situation.\" when the doused patron mentioned that her satin blouse was likely ruined, his reply \"send me dry-cleaning bill.\"  Wow. I was little surprised at how flippant he was. Maybe he made the assumption we could be blown off easily as we where so laid back about it.\nHere's the kicker, he took the spilled drink, the cold soup, and $25 off the bill. A cab back to our hotel to change before going out was more than that.\nThings happen, but what a miserable experience, and any respectable owner would have handled the situation with better care."

Both were very good, but I preferred the Mushroom Crepe. \n\nI do not ask for much in a Crepe. All I need it to be is light, airy, thin, crispy around the edges and have a even light Maillard reaction across both surfaces. The Chefs at Morels met all those Crepe requirements on both dishes. I am a big fan of Gruyere so you cannot trust my opinion on their choice of Cheese as it is most likely biased. The Gruyere in their Crepe was of excellent quality. It had lots of nuttiness and fruitiness. You just know that wheel has Switzerland stamped all over it. The Mushrooms were properly sauteed and seasoned. I had read reviews where people say that their food had no flavor. I am a big proponent of letting the staff know your if food is bland. Thankfully, I did not have this issue on this trip to Morels. \n\nThe Toast was a couple of pieces of Brioche, some Jam and Butter. It was a good breakfast accompaniment but nothing I didn't have at home. \n\nI see quite a mixed bag of reviews for Morels. I have eaten here more than a few times and  have always had a good experience with the food. I will continue to eat here as long as that stays true."

For an entree my boss and I shared the Brick Chicken (we have a favorite restaurant back home in Colorado that makes something similar so naturally, we wanted to try it). It was different but very good and in addition to the appetizers we had already gotten, sharing one was perfectly sized. Our guest got the Surf & Turf (filet mignon and lobster tail) which was JUST as good at it sounds! We also shared a side of green beans; they were tasty but I will say that $11 for a less-than-generously portioned side of green beans is outrageous. Their sommalier suggested a phenomenal bottle of pinot noir that paired well with everything.\n\nWe ended the evening with the Trio of Creme Brulees - they were great! Overall, the atmosphere was very nice, the service was good (the junior server in our case was more attentive than our primary server - maybe that's why they had both!), and the food was excellent. I would recommend Morel's to anyone and would love to return next time I'm in Las Vegas."

            "review": "Here's the deal, I've been here probably 10 times over the last several years. The service and the food are hit or miss. Its not the people, it is a management problem. This becomes clearer after you get to know they staff, who are very friendly and, I think, are doing their best given the leadership.\n\nLet's start with the negative, the principal issues are food quality and inconsistency. You can have a great steak one week and a marginal steak the next. It could be cooked the way you ordered one week and the next its like you got someone else's order. Too many people service one table, you never know who is in charge because the guy or gal who appears to be your waiter, is on again off again. I think this is because when they are slow, they spread servers too thin. I've had good and bad servers, last night I had Eldifon and he was above average.\n\nOn the positive side, they have an expansive wine list covering California, France and  Italy; the values are not there in terms of price, but they have selection. I was there on October 16 and the sommelier was great, he recommended a very good montrachet that was 3.5 times its retail, a little high for an '09. \n\nThough terribly inconsistent in terms of what they may have from time to time (management not minding the cheese list), they have one of the best cheese lists in Vegas and in the West when its in order. Too boot, they have about 20 bottles on the 'by the glass list' that are good for pairings with the cheese. They could probably do a better job of helping people make decisions, but, again...\n\nThis is a diamond in rough shape. I would not do an important meal here, but if you are willing to go through some bumps its not a bad spot to try out. There are certainly worse!"

The waitress suggested to me that the steak temp be medium \"in order to fully release the flavor\" -- since medium is how I usually order my steaks, I agreed.\n\nThe table's food soon arrived and I started eating my steak at the narrower end of the NY and it was fine. By the time I got about half way through my steak, it was essentially raw and not just in the middle but through about 80% of of the steak. Looked around and two of my clients who ordered steaks also had them extremely under cooked.\n\nCalled the waitress over and showed her my steak -- there was really no way to dispute the doneness. I'm not even sure it was safe to eat even if you like a med-rare steak it was well under done. The waitress agreed and offered to bring it up to temp.\n\nOver the years I've learned to never send food back and ask for it to be fixed. Better to just walk away from a bad meal. I told the waitress not to bother and went back to talking with my clients and associates. \n\nEventually the manager approaches, apologizes and makes a token offer of a drink or a dessert to me for the trouble. I wasn't really that hungry and was with clients, so not wanting to make a scene, I simply said no thanks. The manager apologizes again and says he has spoken with the kitchen.\n\nMy company was picking up the bill, so I didn't press it, but what floors me in all of this is: \n\n1. If you pay $64 for a steak it better be cooked correctly. If anybody had simply checked the temp of *any* of the steaks at our table, they would have realized the problem. It should have never even been sent out.\n\n2. At no point did the manager offer to pick up the cost of the steak, offer us a free meal, anything. He simply shrugged his shoulders and walked away, thinking he had done all he could.\n\n3. There was a big conference staying at the hotel, we were all in business attire, but the manager didn't seem to consider that we were with clients (or that maybe I *was* a customer of the host, since I didn't pick up the check). Or maybe he did realize and didn't offer the comp because we were going to expense the meal.\n\nIf it had been just me or my wife and I on a date, I would have probably pressed it a bit more. If it had been a $20 steak, I would have probably just written it off, but for $64 you expect perfection or near perfection.\n\nNeedless to say I will never bring a customer to Morel's again nor eat there myself."

When he asked to get the steak recooked, it came back nearly burnt on the outside. My other friend ordered the same thing and got it medium well. For a steakhouse, I would think this should be their best dish. I got the 18 hour braised short rib. Actually, it wasn't that bad at all! The sauce they provide goes really well with the meat, and you get a little bit of a \"side\" with it, so it help take a break from all the meat. The only downside was the meat was a bit on the dry side if I didn't pour the sauce all over it. Luckily they provide extra sauce on the side, just in case."
