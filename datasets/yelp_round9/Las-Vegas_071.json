            "review": "While there are tons of great reviews here on Yelp, I feel that Rosemary's Restaurant deserves all of it so I will add mine as well. This place was soooo good, all the way around. Great service. Fantastic food. Yummy dessert. Tasty drinks. As everyone has mentioned, this place is tucked away in a strip mall about 15 minutes from the strip. Not hard to find though but off the beaten path. \n\nWe dined on a Wednesday night which is ladies night so we received a 50% discount - great deal! We both opted for the 3 course tasting menu which essentially allows you to order anything you want from the menu as long as one entree is included. It's the first 'tasting menu' I have ever experienced like this. We both chose appetizers, entree, dessert but you could choose 2 appetizers and an entree and I suppose an entrees and 2 desserts if you wanted.\n\nThe chef provided a bite of a FABULOUS veggie quiche sort of thing before we began our meal. It was sooo yummy - I would have loved a few more bites! Then I had the Tasso Ham and Crawfish Risotto as my starting course while M had the Caesar Salad. Both were delicious. The risotto was a little spicy but done just right - a little burn, not a big fire in my mouth. Then I chose a special entree they were offering that night which was a crispy skin striped sea bass. M chose the Ribeye. Again, both were absolutely DELICIOUS. For dessert I had the pecan tart and she had the apple tart. Yum yum yum. Again, the chef provided a dessert tasting as well which includes bites of lemon bars, brownies, and peanut butter buckeyes. The buckeyes were my favorite of the three.\n\nI also feel that I should point out the service was impeccable. Very on the ball but not overbearing. And, even though it wasn't extremely busy while we were there they had enough servers to take care of a party of 8 nearby and delivered all 8 entrees simultaneously, one server per person. \n\nThe bread was good. The drinks were good. Really, there is nothing to complain about. It was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time!"

            "review": "Have heard all the raves for a while now and finally had a trip in Vegas with a rental car so had to take advantage.. Ordered the prix fixe for $55 which saves you around $5-10 if you were to order each dish a la carte.\n\nFirst course - Salmon Tartare - this was excellent, I've had a lot of tartares and so often they seem either under or over seasoned, but this one stood out.... it was seasoned perfectly, the saffron sauce enhanced the dish, and the texture was just right.  \n\nSecond Course - Parmesan Souffle - I love everything about the ingredients.. parm, mushrooms, garlic... but the overall result was a bit of a letdown.. the flavor of parmesan did not come through for me as much as the garlic cream sauce did. It also made the souffle a soggy mess to chew. I don't know if this dish was intended to be this way, but I wouldn't order it again. \n\nThird Course - Texas Striped Bass - served with adouille, shrimp, hush puppies, potatoes, meniere sauce... almost too much going on in this plate for me. However that's a very minor complaint.  The bass itself was awesome.. skin was crisped perfectly , fish cooked well throughout, and the sauce full of flavor.  The portion of fish was very generous too.\n\nService and presentation were excellent.  Also got to love the beer pairings offered with each course, I don't drink much wine and wish more foodie centric restaurants would offer this option.\n\nIf you're a light eater I'd recommend not choosing two apps like I did and substitute one for a dessert or soup.. I've got a good appetite but I felt like I had more food than I could handle.. \n\nOverall I definitely need to come back here since I saw many dishes on the menu I'd like to try.  Very good dining experience and $$ wise a great value for the type of restaurant it is."

            "review": "Question: Where do two foodies go for their wedding reception, just after they get married by Elvis in Vegas?\n\nAnswer: Rosemary's!\n\nMy friends rented out the main room for the evening. Everything was superb (this is one of those times I need more than 5 stars). We had a delicious seven course tasting menu. Both wine and beer pairings were offered. I've never heard of a beer pairing and thought that was an awesome idea, especially for the non wine-drinkers.\n\nThe service was impeccable. The coolest part? Even though our table was a table of 14, we all got served at the exact same time. No, really! Each waiter had 2 plates and they placed them at the same time.  That was an excellent touch!\n\nOne waiter was especially in charge of my friend and practically jumped over tables to make sure she never had to pull out her chair and also that she and her new hub were perfectly happy. They were.\n\nWhen we pulled up (in a big, huge bus, mind you!), a few of us were taken aback by the strip mall and the green neon. Don't let the Krazy Buffet or Stein Mart in the same lot fool you!  The atmosphere was lovely and we soon forgot we were tucked away in such a lovely little restaurant. \n\nEverything about the evening was perfect."

I asked one to recommend me a beer because they were out of Stella Artois and what he brought back made Stella look like a Bud Lite. Food is amazing and i cant remember half of it due to how much exotic beers i've been drinking. \n\nA best kept secret of Las Vegas. The location itself threw me off, wedged between some kind of discount goods store and a nail place but inside is classy and food deserves a six star rating."

This time we brought 7 other people, and they all loved their meals. The staff was as warm and as attentive as before.  All plates were served at the same time, so serving 9 people warranted a great attention to timing and detail.\nThe chef provided two amuse bouches and some small bite desserts at the end of the meal.  I had the lamb chops and they were delicious--a friend also ordered them cooked differently, and both plates were cooked exactly as ordered.  We all ordered a variety of dishes and we tried one another's and they were all so tasty.  The caring waitstaff and the lovely food made this once again an amazing evening.  The next day I received a phone call from the manager asking how was our dining experience.\nSuch attention to detail! We'll come back again and again."

            "review": "I found a promotion on their website for a $20 prix fixe weekday lunch (normally it is $25...still a good deal), so while I was on xmas vacation, I took my parents here. It's location was a bit off putting, being in a strip mall and all, but once you go inside, you find it is very pleasant inside. The service was good, although the waiter seemed a bit young (maybe im getting old). Maybe seeing a young kid act as stodgy as he could was sort of amusing. As always, my parents took forever to choose what they wanted, and the servers were patient. We decided to order as many different things as possible. This is what I had\n\nAppetizer: Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp with Maytag Blue Cheese Coleslaw.\n\nEntree:  Grilled Wild King Salmon on a Granny Smith Cabbage Slaw with Candied Walnuts...\n\nDessert: Coconut Bread Pudding with Coconut Sorbet and Dark Chocolate Sauce\n\nThe appetizer I had read about on ahem...Chowhound to overwhelming accolades, but i found it to be overrated. The BBQ sauce was overly sweet and the blue cheese a bit gimmicky. Tasty but unspectacular. The entree was substantial and robust, tho I actually enjoyed my moms choice best, which was the Pan Seared Hawaiian Mahi Mahi. It was very succulent. By dessert, we were already stuffed but they stood out as the highlight. The Chocolate Flourless Cake was a surprise favorite. The Rustic Apple Tart would have been better served warm. The Coconut Bread Pudding was very sweet and very good. \n\nI had successfully won over my buffet-obsessed and skeptical parents, and they ended up crowing all last week to their friends about the place. Great value for very good food."

            "review": "I love Rosemary's. It is by far the best place I've been to on the west side of Vegas. The food is yummy, but tends to be quite rich and meaty. It's not mind blowing food, but it is consistently good. There are lots of nice touches that makes this place worth coming back to time and time again. The menu varies with the season as does the cocktail list. There is always a complimentary amuse bouche and a mini selection of sweets after dinner. I've found the service to be excellent and the place is extremely cozy. They also have great specials such as industry night, ladies night, and a good value prix fixe. I've found myself at Rosemary's quite often, it is dangerously close to becoming my local."

            "review": "One of my FAVORITE restaurants by far!!! My Dad introduced me to this place (off the Vegas strip) a few years ago. It's a bit of a drive and the location is in a strip mall, but once you walk inside the decor is very elegant and classy. \n\nI've been here about 4 times (only for lunch) with my fiance and friends. We tell everyone about this place whenever we hear someone is going to Vegas. I actually tried to take my colleagues to Rosemary's during a business trip; my boss said $25 was too much for lunch, but I would have paid because the food and service are soooo worth it. I've never had wait staff place my napkin on my lap everytime I got up and sat down.\n\nLunch Recommendations:\n1. Hugo's BBQ shrimp - large enough for an entree. Delicious\n2. Mahi Mahi - very tender\n3. Chocolate cake - if you're a dark chocolate lover, you'll be in heaven\n\nI can rave about this place all day. My fiance and I actually wanted to have Rosemary's cater our wedding, but the location wouldn't allow an outside caterer. Oh well, we just enjoy it when we're in town."

Excellent service (waiters call you \"Sir\" and \"M'am\" and put cloth napkins on your lap), nice ambience, and food that never disappoints.  Can't go wrong with the $23 prix fixe lunch (printable coupon on their site).   Incomparable duck confit entree!  We always bring our own wine or champagne!  We love Vegas buffets but Rosemary's is a treat every time.  Don't hesitate to go!"

            "review": "As everyone has mentioned this place is an absolute surprise based on location alone. When you pull up to a strip mall that contains a fine dining restaurant you already go into the meal with a strange feeling in your gut. That feeling is almost instantly vanquished when you enter and are greeted and sat by the courteous wait staff. Black napkins for those wearing black slacks or a dark dress was definitely a snazzy touch I was impressed by.\n\nNow, on to the most important part, the food! Our table did the Prixe Fixe menu and basically tried to share everything. I had the crawfish risotto which was melt in your mouth delicious for my starter. I honestly wished they created an entree version so I could have had more. My entree was a salmon dish which I honestly forgot the accompanying sides but every bite was memorable and this meal happened quite a few months ago. For dessert each person at the table tried something different so we could basically sample all the sweets they had to offer. The apple tart was by far my favorite and their special of the night which was a raspberry chocolate cake honestly tasted burnt. It was the definite low-light of the meal for me. \n\nOverall this place is amazing for the price, not to mention we get $25 off gift certificates randomly in the mail. Their attention to detail and excellent service is amazing. From the amuse-bouche for everyone before the meal to the complimentary desserts with the check this place is a keeper. Who wants to venture to the strip for fine dining at 5 times the price when you can feel like a king while dining in a strip mall? I certainly don't!"

Staying on the strip and didn't have a car...our cab fare was higher than expected, though the gift cards we got at Costco helped offset that a bit.  Very attentive staff....we arrived early but were promptly seated.  The tables for 2 were arranged pretty close to one another, which didn't allow us the level of intimacy we would have liked on Valentine's.  The food was excellent, in particular the veal chop special.  The crab appetizer was very good, but not great.  Would have to say the same about the chocolate cake dessert.  It was half-priced wine night, which came in handy.  Was $200 for two of us, including tip...which was OK as it was a special occasion.  Nice to get away from the strip and to dine with locals.  Given the time and cost of getting there, though, I don't think we will be in a rush to return."

AMAZING. the white chocolate bread was incredibly delicious. never had anything like it.  for appetizer I had the figs stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in prosciutto. the right amount of salty and sweet for an overall orgasmic party in your mouth.\n\nfor my main, I had the rack of lamb. this was by far the best quality of lamb (so well marbled with the right amount of fat) and cooked JUST perfectly (medium rare). The meat was so tender.  The temperature was also perfect and served still warm. The sauce with the olives was pretty good although I personally would've liked some sort of touch of sweetness to complement lamb. Nonetheless, this dish was absolutely delicious. I also added the foie gras to my entree and it was HEAVEN. it was the most generous SLAB of foie gras I had ever seen!  so wrong but so good! my goodness. it was also cooked to perfection. the temperature of it was also just right with the warm seared outside. yes I want to cry just thinking about this entree. tt was THAT good. u HAVE to add the foie.\n\nthe waiter suggested a glass of a bordeaux to go with the lamb and it was the perfect complement with a bold but smooth spiciness. \n\nfor dessert had creme brulee which wasn't mind blowing but it was good. the shell was nice but the inside was cold and I prefer the inside to be a bit warm. the consistency and creaminess of the creme was very good though.\n\nthey also gave complementary truffles and this crispy peanut butter ditty which were amaaazzzzing. what a great finish to a great meal!\n\nalso an extra \"touch\" that made the meal even more amazing is that it was lady's night meaning all my food was 50% off! saved over $40!! how can u not give this place 5 stars?!?!??"

As soon as you walk through the door everything changed, like when those kids walk through the wardrobe.  $55 three course and I had the foie, sweetbreads, and veal.  Amuse bouche for starters and all three dishes were perfect.  Finished with some cookies from the kitchen and they called us a cab for the trip back (another $30). Bonus for going on sunday nights, wine is 50% off.  The service was the best I have had in a long time.  This place is a must when in Las Vegas.  I might go to vegas just to eat at Rosemary's."

I like the 'fact that the food is very high end but they don't have to do the small amount of food on plate approach.  We did not realize that Wednesday night was ladies night (50% off, but an 18% gratuity added).  We would have paid full price.  I am a total sucker for the Texas BBQ shrimp - something about the BBQ sauce and the Maytag blue cheese cole slaw.  Great service and great food.  They brought out a complimentary appetizer and a complimentary dessert.  Just like I remember and no regrets.  Do yourself a favor and get off of the strip and try this place."

            "review": "Oh my gosh. This is the best restaurant ever. We went for our first anniversary on the recommendation of friends of ours and were thrilled that we did. \n\nWe chose the three course prixe fixe meal, which includes an appetizer, entree and dessert for each person. We started with amuse bouche, which is like a little pre-appetizer. It was a delicious vegetable cake with caramelized, diced, vinegar-y onions on top. It was delicious, the sweet, tart combination of the onion and the cake was fantastic. It was followed by another, grits with mushrooms which were fantastic. The grits were creamy and fine, not gritty at all, and the mushrooms were tender and savory. James opted for the bbq shrimp with blue cheese slaw for his appetizer and I went with the duo of tartars, salmon and beef. Both were fantastic. The entrees we chose were lamb chops (James) and seared scallops (me). My scallops were simple and fantastic, served with creamed potatoes and mushrooms in a light broth that added just enough flavour. For dessert, James went with the chocolate cream pie and I had the trio of sorbets (of which the blackberry was best). Our waiter also brought out a special dessert, with the words \"Happy 1st Anniversary\" written in chocolate along the edge. \n\nOur meal took about 2 hours, so plan to spend time there. We never felt rushed, and even though the restaurant was a bit loud, it still felt intimate and we had no trouble talking to each other. Our waiter was attentive, but never intrusive and always asked us if we were satisfied with out orders. I had the impression that had we not been, he would have offered a different choice. It was fantastic and a lovely end to our Vegas vacation. I would definitely send others there and I would come back in a heartbeat. It is expensive, but it is worth every penny; the whole experience is stellar and the food is magnificent."

During my business trip to Vegas, I was fortunate to have a friend who is a local who took me here so I could enjoy a good meal and stay far off the awful strip.  This was a great time, with only a few suggestions for improvement.\n\nService - although they made us wait 15 minutes past our reservation for a table, our waitress was FANTASTIC as was the supporting staff.  Lots of little details attended to that I loved - very classy without being snooty, from the simple pulling out (and pushing in) of my chair to asking if we had any food allergies.  The waitress was funny and entertaining and really genuine - we adored her (I forgot her name but she looks like the gorgeous Hilary Swank).  The food was fantastic - started with the crab boulettes (really creative and good) and chestnut soup (wow the soup was phenomenal), and I had the sea scallops while my friend had the filet mignon.  My scallops were prepared gorgeously and were atop pureed parsnips (maybe a bit more flavor to the parsnips would've been nice?) and the hush puppies side order were great.  We were too full for dessert, but the cocktails were good (thank you for asking what kind of vodka I wanted in my lemon drop) and the cote du rhone was perfect.  My only significant issues?  1) they serve foie gras, supporting a horribly cruel practice; and 2) they do not recycle!!  There were huge garbage cans full of bottles - they said there is no recycling available but my friend said there indeed is recycling in Vegas, so that left a bad taste in my mouth.  c'mon Vegas, with all that waste as it is, the least y'all can do is show some environmental sensitivity....but alas, everything else was so perfect that I still give them a great rating.  \n\nNote:  not sure that $25 is \"a steal\" for lunch as per another review.  Las Vegas is exorbitantly priced and  being off-strip I had hoped for more reasonable prices but the two of us still spent $150 on dinner excluding tip.  boo."

Fiance got the filet with leeks beef carpaccio, and parmesan souffle. I loved his appetizers. The parm souffle was to die for. My salad was just ok and I was not a big fan of the crabcakes. The tuna was pretty good. \n\nI will surely be back since I have consistently had good meals here. I will order something else next time. For $55 for 3 courses off the strip with no hassles, I think it's a nice treat for special occasions."

I really enjoy a great fine dining experience and based on previous experiences (Tableau and Daniel Boulud Brasserie at the Wynn) I couldn't help but judge a book by it's cover and cringe when we drove up to a strip mall. My cousin attends the Cordon Bleu and his chef owns and runs this restaurant and we went to try it out. \n\nIt was a bit uncomfortable being dressed up walking to this restaurant it just looks like a normal faced strip mall restaurant. But as soon as you walk in it is real nice and a typically dim lit environment the ambiance is relaxing. The service is phenomenal being a lady it's always a joy to be treated as one should be. My chair was pulled out and gently pushed in. I was always served first (it erks me when people aren't taught manners and courtesy) this wait staff has been trained to proper manners. The menu had a great selection it was really hard to chose. I went with the prix fixe option crab boulette (basically a crab cake), halibut linguist and coconut bread pudding. It was all so delicious! My bf had brick chicken (so moist and wonderfully seasoned), his bro had the scallops (yummy perfectly cooked), and my cousin also had the prix fixe option sweet corn soup, sea bass and flourless chocolate cake (yumm!). Bottles of wine were 50% off so we had to check out the menu and let me tell you only great restaurants carry Cakebread so we enjoyed a great bottle of chardonnay. \n\nLike I said the service was phenomenal when any of us left the table either the napkins were folded or when we'd come back to the table someone was there to assist us with our chair. Silverware was replaced without our notice we called them ninja servers our water or wines were always filled never even near empty. We were also offered some tastings of some seafood dip and chip and some bite size desserts lemon tart, peanut butter balls and chocolate covered mints.\n\nWe all really enjoyed our dining experience and couldn't complain about the check for the service and the fine food $250 is cheap for 4 people with a bottle of wine. \n\nI totally recommend this for a date it's not all that impressive on the outside but for you males you're female date will appreciate being treated like a lady! \n\nWe will come back next time we're in Vegas. Great place!"

I have to say that this ugly duckling of a restaurant was one of the greatest dining experiences I've ever had.  I'm usually not a fan of prix fixe menus because they always find a way for you to have at least one course where all of the selections are equally as unappealing.  Their menu is perfect.  There are great options for each course.  I've had the pleasure of eating here three times, expecting it to get worse or for reality to set in.  Well, it has, and the place is outstanding."

So many strip restaurants tout that they \"fly this in from Alaska\" and \"this in from Maine\", but when it comes down to it, the menu and flavors at Rosemary's are top notch. \nWe came here after I read so many wonderful recommendations. It is about 30-45 minutes off the strip, which can be a costly limo ride, but it's all worth it if you have a sophisticated palate. The wine list will not disappoint. \nI suggest sharing, as there are so many worthy plates.\nEnjoy!"

Having lived here for almost 4 decades, the strip is the last place I want to be to enjoy a great meal.\n\nEven when I lived in Henderson, I didn't mind driving to the west side suburban location.  It's quiet, easily accessible, and has tons of parking.  No walking through smoky, loud, annoying casinos; jostling your way through crowds of preoccupied tourists, and no over-the-top prices.  I relish the opportunity to patronize a locally owned/operated family business.  They face challenges that strip restaurants do not with staffing, employee benefits, and they don't have the benefit of buying their produce/meats/beverages 'en-mass' like the massive strip corporations.\n\nChef/Proprietors Wendy and Michael Jordan have truly created a local phenomenon.  Although I have dined there dozens of times since their opening years ago, my most recent experience in July 2009 was definitely most memorable.  Having dined at 3 Michelin star restaurants both stateside and abroad, I would have to say that Rosemary's delivers the atmosphere, service, and food quality equal to many of them.\n\nFrom the initial phone contact with the host while making the reservation; the warm greeting when we walked in; the amazingly thorough menu description given by the server; the attentive, yet unobtrusive service given throughout the meal by the entire staff; the way the staff steps aside to give way as guests walk through the dining room; the napkin being folded and replaced on your lap when you return; to the petit fours offered (after you are so full you have to take them home); to the final goodbye and offer to come back, even the most discerning of diners would be impressed.\n\nTo add icing to the cake, they are currently offering a 3 course, weekday prix fixe lunch menu for $24, and they also offer a la carte, prix fixe, and tasting menu for dinner.  Most notably, our table was asked about dining restrictions and allergies by the busser/back-waiter as he poured our water selection - in less than 2 minutes, the server/front-waiter was discussing my options with me and the menu in great detail to ensure I didn't accidentally order something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nIf you are craving a fine dining experience, with all of the bells and whistles, without the hustle and bustle of the strip, the wallet-emptying prices, and the parking/valet nightmares, treat yourself to Rosemary's for a power lunch or an incredible dinner.  Although they have both a full bar and a well-balanced and eclectic wine list, don't be shy to ask their unpretentious and knowledgeable sommelier about an artisanal beer pairing with your food.  They have one of the best beer lists in town!"

After eating two other meals on the strip that ended up costing even more for average food, I realize this restaurant for the amazing gift it is.  The food and service were exquisite and worth every cent.  This will become the standard to which I hold every special meal, and I fear it will be hard to match.  My only suggestion for a group of three people would be to get two prix fixe meals and another entree for a party of three.  This gives you four appetizers/desserts instead of six.  By the time our entrees came, we were completely full.  I did have a most amazing lunch with my leftovers the next day, though!"

Inventive, well-presented, tasty and balanced dishes come in waves by a team-service staff that really knows the dishes and truly cares about your dinner. But this isn't an intimidating place. Underdressed? No reservation? Don't know a salad fork from your dinner fork? That's okay, the staff didn't miss a beat and was wonderful at every step. Do make a reservation, though.

I have to say it's one of the best Carpaccio appetizers I have had in Vegas. The flavors blend wonderfully in you mouth and the thinly sliced beef just melts in your mouth. They also offered the Yellowfin Tuna Carpaccio and it was a tough decision between the two. I overheard the woman at the next table say the Tuna was also delicious! \n\nThe Angel Hair Pasta was yummy as well, but the Coconut Bread Pudding was to die for! It's comes out warm, and is topped with chocolate and has a side of vanilla icecream .. it kinda reminds me of a cross between a coconut macaroon and butter mochi.

Las Vegas is an odd town; I totally am willing to accept that the \"good\" places in Vegas are all scattered about in assuming locations like strip malls, while the glitz of the main drag is all flash & no substance. At Rosemary's, I started with Harvistoun Old Engine Oil, a thick dark Scottish beer that I can't remember if I've had it before? I know I've had the Harvistoun Ola Dubh & hadn't been all that knocked out by it-- or rather, it hadn't lived up to the expectations that I had for it. Anyhow, for dinner we got the chef's tasting menu with the beer pairings-- a well cultivated beer list was a big part of why Jenny chose this place. Our first course was baby arugula in Meyer lemon vinaigrette with sliced salmon gravlax, shaved red onion, fried capers & braised leek cream, & the beer matched with it was a Belgian, Tripel Karmeliet. The second course was the star of the menu, if you ask me-- fried veal sweetbreads with foie gras butternut squash quinoa & bloody mary butter sauce. Oh, heck yeah, glands. The beer was Indian Wells Mojave Red-- take note of Indian Wells, because they have a nice output. I'm normally \"over\" reds, but I liked this. Course three was seared pompano with parsnip & potato puree, crispy proscuitto, parsnip strips & an apple cide beurre blanc. That came with Unibroue Ephemere Apple, which knocked our socks off. It is a really apple-tasting beer, & reminded us of our dear Professor Fritz Briem Grut. We kept bugging our server to tell us more about it & making him run back to their beer sommelier. The main course-- oof, I was stuffed by the time it came-- was roasted rack of lamb with swiss chard, caramelized red onions & garlic reduction. It came with the Devastator Doppelbock which was lighter in colour than I expected but had the requisite punch. Desert was chocolate cream pie, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, & a Framboise Lambic ice cream float. It came with another Indian Wells-- the Indian Wells Orange Blossom Amber which was a great dessert beer. The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e?"

She suggested Rosemary's, because she has a $25.00 coupon for the restaurant. \n\nThis is a classy and dressy kind of restaurant. With an atmosphere like Rosemary, this is a type of restaurant you'll never see me dine at. Once in a while, I need to use the Gold Credit Card and dine at nice places like here. \n\nWe started out with endless refills of water. Our waiter suggested a Prix fixed meal for $55.00 per person. With little experience what is a Prix fixed meal and LiLy not being all that hungry, we went our separate ways and ordered a dish for ourselves. \n\nWe were started with a pair of dinner rolls (one sweet and one savory). \nRolls: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA?select=ZQ6rvT_g-LPIREwhOnkNiQ\n\nAnd we had a small piece of a savory bread pudding made with a hint of Onion Marmalade and Tomato Vinaigrette.\nSide: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA?select=syNZC1ipjg0tHK370KOTfA\n\nShe ordered the Grilled Pork Chop with some spicy mustard sauce. For $35.00, her huge pork chop had a crusty outer-layer with a mixture of blended seasoning, but moist interior, and a mixed Rice and Black Eye Peas Pilaf. She also had a glass of \"Old World\" Cabernet with her meal. You'll need to read her review for her take on her dish.\n\nHer Pork Chop: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA?userid=675iUt7yCOg145N7JoyBug\n\nOk, my turn.

It made me think to myself, \"I've got to check this place out before I move from this town.\"  It was good but not memorable.\n\nI arrived here on a Wednesday night at about 6:30 pm.  One hostess was nice and the other took herself way too seriously.  I told them that I knew that they were booked heavily for that evening but when could I get a table.  The evil one told me 9 pm with a serious scoff in her voice then asked if that would be suitable.  The nicer one asked if I wanted to wait there or come back.  I told them I would wait. (I didn't really want to, but I was curious as to what they would do.)  The nicer one said, \"Let me see if there's a table we can get you in the bar.\" The evil one stopped her and said, \"No, she doesn't need a table in the bar.\"  The nicer one, \"There's no one sitting there. All I have to do is get a chair.\"  The evil one, \"No.\"  The nicer one looks at me like \"help me\".  I smiled and told them I would be back in a bit.  I went out to my car to check my email and to see who kept calling me.  Anyone works at a 24/7 type career field will tell you that your work is never really done, so I answered emails, phone calls, and texts.  By the time I looked up, it had been 2 hours, so I went back in.  Lo and behold, the evil one was gone, and I didn't have to deal with her the rest of the night.  Thank God!\n\nI told the nice one I would be in the bar until my table was ready because I had a few more loose ends to tie up.  She smiled and told me my table was ready-- 1/2 hr early-- and started to apologize for the other girl.  I raised up my hand and told her that the gesture is appreciated but the explanation is not needed.  After I was seated, the wait staff was prompt.  I had my sparkling water and declined the drink menu.  I was driving, and I wanted to taste my food to see what the hype was about.  The waiter handed me the menu and asked if I wanted some time.  I told him I wanted the tasting menu ($80 with no wine or beer pairings. I believe it goes up to $115 for beer and $135 with wine or at least somewhere in that ballpark.).\n\nIt was five courses of better than average cuisine but nothing ground breaking.  The first was the Creole Beef and Bison Tartar.  That was very fresh.  My second was the Cashew Crusted Salmon w/Wasabi Creamed Potatoes & Ginger Soy Butter Sauce.  Well executed salmon, but my favorite part of the dish was the wasabi creamed potatoes.  This was something to write home about.  Course three was Pan Fried Veal Sweetbreads w/Black Beluga Lentils & Bloody Mary Butter.  The waiter mentioned that this is one of his favorites, and it is for good reason.  My main course was Roasted Rack of Lamb w/Kalamata Olive Creamed Potatoes & Balsamic Reduction Sauce.  I must say now I know for certain that I do not like lamb, but this also was still very good.  The dessert course was a trio-- creme brulee, chocolate cake, and a framboise lambic and hazelnut float.  That chocolate cake was very rich.  I took a bite and that was plenty for an non-chocolate lover.\n\nMy water was refilled periodically and kept on ice 2 tables away. They really weren't on top of that.  Service, in fact, was average at best.  Honestly, throw the wait staff from Yardhouse in different attire and give some of them European accents, and the service would have been better. The espresso I ordered after dessert was average at best.  I didn't know that I came in on ladies' night, which meant my food was 1/2 off.  That was a great surprise with the check and 18% gratuity was added in automatically even though I was dining alone.  Maybe when the food is not 1/2 off it will live up to its reputation.\n\nOverall, I would say that this place has all the dressings and presentation of a fine dining restaurant.  It has its niche following.  The ingredients were reasonably fresh and were seasoned to highlight the natural flavors but not accent them or to intrigue you.  For me, it was all a bit unimaginative... And to get on my soap box slightly, a good meal can open your eyes to another place, challenge your beliefs, make you fall in love, remind you of a time gone by, or to raise you expectations of what can really be done in a kitchen!  This why I dine out!  None of this is happening here, which means I really could have cooked all of this at home myself-- especially since I could have gotten the cookbook on disc for an additional $10.  A well-executed tasting menu can take you on a journey.  Ordering it can be like telling a chef to tell you a story and/or to show you his wares.  For me the story was ho-hum.  As for his wares, he knows how to cook and can follow a recipe but cannot challenge his guests to something more... which makes  this place grossly average."

Started with the foie gras and it was cooked perfectly! The only thing I didn't like about it was the marmalade tended to take too much away from the foie gras, rather than complementing the flavor it almost took over too much. Then on to the beef & maytag bleu cheese carpaccio which was outstanding! For the main course I had the creole grilled prime ribeye which was not only cooked perfectly but was excellent in flavor & texture.\nMy wife had the seared scallops and thought they were amazing as well. I tried one and they were cooked perfectly and I don't think they could've been made better.\nThe reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was I felt that the service was a little lacking and by that I don't mean bad. I feel that our waiter could've been a little more attentive so hopefully next time we go that will change.\nWe will definitely be going back and I would definitely recommend this to my friends & family. The cost for one prix fixe, seared scallops and 4 drinks was roughly $120 if that helps anybody."

Multi-course dinner for 2 including drinks for less than 100 per person!?!!?  and the portions were not small!  What i'm still tasting on my tongue are the complex flavors of all the sauces associate with each plate.  Wow..."

Last night, I returned w/my family to celebrate my brother's birthday and I was gravely disappointed! The evening specials did not deserve the word \"special\", while the risotto was soupy and the salad was limp & overdressed. Beef carpaccio-bland. The special fish entree, a pathetic thai attempt, was boring and unforgettable, as well as the pompano on the regular menu. Meat dishes were fine, but by nature are a no brainer. It pained me to give them several hundred $ of my hard earned money after this meal. I've never experienced such a poor meal at these prices, not even in my hometown of NYC. The saving grace was a helpful sommelier and lovely Katie, our server."

They take courteous and warm front of house staff to pair with the elegant and comforting New American/French cuisine brought forth from the kitchen. \n\nOur party of nine had many challenges: two people didn't eat meat, one person had an aggressive food allergy (garlic, onions and dairy), we came into the establishment with one extra person, and finally, half of us needed to make a show at 9pm. \n\nWe sat at 6pm in an intimate dining room made exclusive for large parties next to a nice wine cellar. I ordered the prix fixe menu, where at $55 for three courses, was an overabundant amount of food. I started with an appetizer of fried sweetbreads, then had a warm spinach salad with a fried patty of goat cheese and candied walnuts. My main was a huge slab of prime ribeye, executed to perfection (a warm, red center with char on the outside) sitting on top of a dark red pond of spicy, homemade steak sauce. The grits were creamy and smooth, and the fried onions were the perfect accessory to the meat.\n\nMy bf tried carpaccio for the first time, and loved it. I decided against dessert, but would have loved to try a smidgeon of the cheese course.\n\nDid I forget to tell you everything was absolutely delicious? The vegetarians were quite happy with their choices and the allergy-prone friend had an excellent meal centered around a perfect filet.\n\nThe manager helped us select two very nice grenaches, one of which had gorgeous tannins and creme caramel, and the other with the whiff of barnyard and graphite.\n\nThis is not to be missed, and as good as any four star restaurant on the strip."

Both times I ordered these, it was the second course in a three course meal, and I should have learned my lesson the first time and had my main course first. Followed up by the striped bass, I was too full and there was slightly too much time between courses and I could not finish my entree. It was still amazing reheated the next day, though."

Thanks to Mike C for the heads up on the restaurant.com certificate which I also used. Food roundup:\n\nAppetizer of BBQ shrimp: Nice and plump perfectly seared shrimp with bbq sauce on top. It also comes with some creamy blue cheese coleslaw, very funkalicious. Whole dish kinda creamy and rich, could've used some citrus to brighten it up. Still tasty.\n\nEntrees of seared scallops and salmon: Both of these were cooked beautifully and tasty. Parsnip puree with scallops a bit lukewarm, but loved the fried thin parsnip garnish. Sauces also were nice with these dishes.\n\nDessert of bread pudding: I don't remember exactly what it consisted of, but it was warm and tasty with some nice ice cream.\n\nLowdown: Great random place (strip mall) for some well-executed, straightforward, delicious food. Nothing is going to be out there, completely new, or innovative...just tasty. There's a lot of restaurants at this price level who try to do the same type of thing, but fail, Rosemary's does it right. Also, they have awesome service: asking for any food allergies, folding your napkin when you go to the restroom, just anticipating your every need and exceeding expectations. I see why locals and tourist alike come here, you're treated like royalty. I was taken a bit aback, but it's their thing. If you've got a car, nice place to go. They do a 3 course (any combo of app and/or entree and/or dessert) for $55 for dinner."

Before you start cussing at me for not knowing 'fine food', please understand that I am just giving my honest opinions purely on our dinning experience.  It could be that we ordered the wrong food or simply this is just not my type of restaurant.  \n\nI had book-marked Rosemary's Restaurant for more than a year.  As often as I come to Vegas, I hadn't made it here until last Monday, 11/23/09.  The restaurant is in a strip mall.  From the exterior, it's unassuming, but the interior decor and atmosphere make this place cozy and charming.  \n\nWe arrived 20 minutes early than our reservation, but were seated quickly.  2 assistant servers came to introduce themselves and who our server would be.  Service was very attentive, too attentive to the point that I actually felt unease.  The assistant servers walked around and checked on us so often as if we were being rushed to finished our food so they can take the plates, which they had asked a couple of times if we were done and if they could take the plates.  'No, not yet!'.  \n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nAppetizer - Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp with Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw ($14.50).  This was EXCELLENT!  The shrimps were grilled to perfection with the right smoke flavor.  The slaw was creamy and crunchy.  5 stars!\n\nEntree - Brick Chicken with Haricot Vert, Shoestring Potatoes & Dijonnaise Sauce ($30).  I had the Oven Brick Chicken at the AT LAST CAFE in Long Beach and it was so good that I thought I'd try it here at the Rosemary's.  I took one bite and it was nothing like At Last Cafe!  The skin was not crispy and the meat tasted mushy.  By mushy I meant it almost seemed it's got 'filler' in it.  While the skin tasted salty, the meat itself tasted sweet.  It was just a really weird combination.  I also didn't care for the shoestring potatoes.  It didn't add anything to the chicken (other than the presentation) and were really hard to eat.  \n\nMy fiance had Roasted Filet of Beef and Horseradish Souffl\u00e9 Potatoes, Onion Marmalade, Hydroponic Watercress & Bourbon Green Peppercorn Sauce ($40).  This was a HUGE disappointment.  The beef was tasteless.  Even the sauce failed to add any more flavor to it.  \n\nI got a phone call from the restaurant to see how everything was.  I think the lady expected me to rave about the food.  Unfortunately I had to tell her it was disappointing.  Maybe I'll give it another try next time, or maybe not."

Well, I don't mean to sound like the girl who yelped wolf, but Rosemary's definitely, DEFINITELY deserves five stars.\n\nIt's in a strip mall about 15 minutes away from the strip (first plus). The windows are tinted, almost black even, and you can't see inside from the outside. You walk in and it's this amazingly cozy, warm atmosphere, with servers dancing (not literally) around tables making everyone's evening as pleasant as possible.\n\nI came here with my husband, daughter, husband's boss and boss' family (wife and two kids, 17 and 7). While Rosemary's is by no means a \"family\" restaurant, they were extremely accommodating of our party. I've come to learn just how annoying it is to have babies in restaurants sometimes. Not like I didn't already know this...but I'm always more self-conscious of it now. The staff at Rosemary's acted like the kids were the guests of honor, which was so sweet. They even brought a silver cover for my meal so it wouldn't get cold when I had to tend to the little one away from the table. Very classy all around.\n\nI should mention that the restaurant offers two different prix-fixe options nightly (app/app/entree or app/entree/dessert) in lieu of paying per item. There was also an amuse bouche, which, as I think back to all my dining experiences, I've only had a handful of times, and signals to me a special restaurant that's really got its shit together.\n\nTo start, I had the cauliflower soup. I know what you're thinking: what's the big deal? It was A BIG DEAL. Delicious, rich, like nobody ever thought cauliflower could be. Creamy, with a sprinkling of parmesan and a swirl of olive oil. Decadent, really!\n\nThen I had the salmon on a bed of lentils. It was cooked PERFECTLY medium-rare (and the server mentioned this is how it is normally done and asked if that was ok). It had a flavorful, crunchy crust that was not overwhelming and didn't detract from the joy of the fish itself. The lentils were dressed lightly in some kind of lemony deliciousness. Yep, a real culinary vocabulary I've got. Anyway, they were great. I also got a really great white wine that the waiter suggested I pair with these dishes. (Pairing recommendations are offered on the menu for each dish.) \n\nFor dessert, I decided not to order something else to eat, but rather, a \"fifth avenue\" dessert cocktail, consisting of cream, apricot brandy, and creme de cacao. Wowza! That was strong and delicious. There were a bunch of other drink options available, and the desserts looked wonderful too.\n\nOverall, Rosemary's seems like a very well-kept secret, except that the word has apparently gotten out. Go for a special evening, go for a relaxed drink at the bar ... just go!"

            "review": "Just about the smartest thing Jamie W. and I did on our trip to Vegas this past weekend was rent a car. Last time, we were stuck on the Strip with either extravagantly expensive restaurants trademarked by brand name chefs or the $6.99 Prime Rib special. Nothing in between...nothing. Driving eight miles west of the Strip on Sahara Drive, you can find a stylish, low-key bistro in the middle of a strip mall. Yes, a strip mall. It's called Rosemary's, and there wasn't a sign of an obnoxious out-of-town gambler in the entire place. \n\nSo here's the deal - $55 for a three-course prix fixe dinner, and you don't have to get two desserts. Instead, we went with three appetizers, two entrees and shared one dessert. Bonus points to Rosemary's for allowing such flexibility for the more peckish diners. It ended up being a whole lotta food, and most of it really good. We automatically got two big rolls on our bread plates, a Glazed White Chocolate Pecan and a Potato (see photo). Freshly baked and very tasty. We tried to save one for the dinner itself, but it was hard. Then we were given an amuse-bouche, a little square of Vegetable Bread Pudding with Shaved Chives that was a homey, heavenly pop in the mouth. \n\nThe appetizers turned out to be a bit more hit-and-miss. The Twice Baked Parmesan Souffle with Garlic Cream Sauce and Saute of Wild Mushrooms (see photo) was impeccably presented but could have used more kick and texture to offset the excessive creaminess. The prawns in Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp were really succulent covered with the thick barbecue sauce, an unusual mix that mostly worked, but the Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw was just a little too mayo-like to fully enjoy (see photo). I think a vinaigrette would have worked better. The winners among the appetizers had to be the Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes with Emulsified Ravigote Sauce and Grandma's Sweet & Sour Cucumbers (see photo) where the crunchiness of the boulette's outer crust went very well with the relish-like sauce. \n\nThere was nothing wrong with the Arugula, Endive & Radicchio Salad (see photo) except for the fact that it was completely overshadowed by the showy appetizers. Our luck significantly improved with the two entrees - the Creole Grilled Prime Ribeye with Anson Mills Carolina Quick Grits, Crystal Red Onion Crust and Rosemary's Own Steak Sauce, and the Grilled Veal Tenderloin with Saute of Asparagus, Prosciutto & Maitake Mushrooms and Roasted Garlic Reduction Sauce (see photos). Both were excellent - especially the way the meat was prepared, very tender and flavorful. Jamie and I were pretty full by this time (...we already had a to-go box ready for the leftover meat), but we couldn't leave without trying their Pecan Tart with Brown Sugar Ice Cream. If that wasn't enough, they left us a little plate of little cookies with the check (see photos). \n\nAs good and abundant as the food was, it was really the attentive service that was most memorable about the meal. There seemed to be a trio of guys who were making sure we were served at exactly the right time and refilling our water glasses before they were empty. I kept imagining how much this experience would have cost if the place was in the Bellagio or the Wynn. So is it the Strip or a strip mall for you? Let your palate and pocketbook decide. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...some dishes soared, a few flailed a bit in execution, but the meat was very well prepared \nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...quiet, dim lights in the main dining room...the typical romantic spot \nSERVICE - 5 stars...truly stellar \nTOTAL - 4 stars...a very solid four stars overall for Rosemary's"

Nice touch.\n-Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp w/Blue Cheese Slaw - Figured I had to try this since everyone raves about it, but not sure I would order it again.  The BBQ sauce was amazing, but everything else was just average. \n-Arugula salad with cranberry vinaigrette, blue cheese sauce, chantarelle mushrooms, and duck breast - There was too much going on here for my tastes.

Not sure how all of these elements work together though. \n-Creole Grilled Prime Ribeye - The house made steak sauce really made this dish. It was sweet, smokey, and made the perfectly cooked medium rare ribeye taste great.\n-Flourless chocolate cake with peanut butter sauce and banana ice cream - Great combo. I thought the chocolate cake was going to be warm, but it wasn't. Still rich, sweet and delicious. I could have used more peanut butter sauce. \n-Dessert sampler - On the house. Peanut butter rice krispy bite (my favorite), lemon bar, flourless chocolate cake. \n\nAmbiance: Cozy, intimate, inviting. It is pretty much one big room with tables and chairs.  It would have been nice to have more privacy.  \n\nService: Stellar. Attentive, efficient, friendly, knowledgeable.

Great job with their wine and beer pairings as well. \nThe costco gift cards are the way to go. I've bought some coupons on restaurant.com and tried to use them a few times, but have been denied because it was a holiday. I don't really think that was fair, since it never said that restriction on the coupon."

            "review": "I have been going to try Rosemary's for quite awhile.  It's just down the street a few miles, but I never got around to it.  I recently got a gift certificate for Rosemary's as a result of an NPR donation so off I was to try it out.  I had spoken to a friend who's been here with his wife several times, and I decided to sit where he suggested.  When I arrived about 15 minutes early, I requested a seat at the rear food bar.  There is a counter that looks directly into the cooking area with the two grills and you can watch Leonard and Jason do their magic--along with the rest.\n\nI decided to do the 5 course tasting menu.  Smart idea--it was great.  I had two amuse-bouche--an eggplant caviar on a fried wonton and sauteed mushrooms.  \n\nThe courses:\n\nFirst:  Duo of Tartars - Beef and salmon tartars.  The beef tartar was on a soft boiled egg, part on each egg half.  Very nice plating.\n\nSecond:  Pan seared pompano on a bed of sauteed spinach.  This was the first time I had pompano and I was pleased with the taste of the pompano and I liked it a lot.\n\nThird:  Texas BBQ shrimp with Maytag blue cheese slaw.  Outstanding!  The combination of BBQ sauce with the blue cheese and slaw was amazing!\n\nFourth:  Rack of Lamb over sauteed kale.  Another winner!  Perfect rare cooking for the lamb and very tasty.  I wanted to gnaw on the bones.\n\nFifth:  Dessert - this was a trio of desserts - creme brulee, chocolate cake, and a beer float.  Since I had no alcohol, the server asked if I'd want root beer instead of the lambic beer they use and I chose the root beer.  The trio was quite tasty, especially the creme brulee.\n\nAfter dessert, I was brought some mignardises, a brownie,  a lemon square, and a peanut butter cookie.\n\nService was impeccable.  Before my iced tea was finished, the server brought me a fresh glass when I had less than 1/3 left.  He asked me again later if I need another replacement and he was there in a few moments.\n\nSome of my friends from Yelp have mentioned the saltiness of some things.  I noticed that last night, but as a person to loves salt, it was not an issue for me.  You might want to be aware of this in advance.\n\nI have to say a word about my seating.  SInce I dined alone, this was just perfect.  I enjoyed watching the kitchen staff do their thing and it was great fun to watch the ballet of grilling, searing, sauteeing, and plating that took place before me.  Even if you were there with a significant other, it would be a good place to sit but not for a romantic dinner.\n\nThis was a superb dinner--5 star all the way!  I will be back!"

            "review": "Last weekend, my husband and I celebrated his birthday by taking a trip to Las Vegas. We drove out Friday morning, spent the afternoon relaxing by the pool, and enjoyed a perfect meal at Rosemary's, a quaint restaurant located about 20 minutes from the strip.\n\nWhen you enter the restaurant, you step into a world that is beyond the simple strip mall you entered. The scenery is romantic and classy. A bar on the right boasts top shelf liquors, along with a few specialty beers on tap. A cocktail before dinner is the perfect start to the evening, and I suggest any beer lover enjoy a pint of the Tripel Karmelite.\n\nThe dining room reveals comfort and luxury paired with exquisite service. Rosemary's offers all dishes a la carte, or you can enjoy their prix-fixe dinner, containing three courses, for $55. Everyone in our party of four opted for the prix-fixe dinner as most entrees were priced between $30 and $45, so it seemed to be the best deal.\n\nFor my appetizer, I chose the Tasso Ham and Crawfish Risotto with Smoked Tomato Jus. The dish was moist but not mushy, with a subtle smokiness from the tomato jus and the perfect amount of salt from the tasso ham. The crawfish was perfectly cooked and decadent--not fishy. I also sampled the Salmon Tartar, which was very fresh and perfectly seasoned. The Twice Baked Parmesean Souffle and the Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes were both rich, indulgent dishes best for sharing. Overall, the consensus was that the risotto was the favorite appetizer of the night.\n\nFor the salad course, the Arugula, Endive & Radiccio Salad came with Maytag Blue Cheese, a Riesling Poached Pear, Toasted Hazelnuts & Port Wine Syrup. The pepper in the arugula complimented the tart blue cheese and the sweet poached pear for a perfect combination of flavors. The Caesar for Mark salad came with Parmesean croutons and a fresh Caeser dressing with anchovies. While some of the diners at my table found it to be too fishy, I thought the dressing was exceedingly fresh and a perfect combination. The croutons, while tasty, were too large to be eaten in one bite, and therefore a challenge.\n\nFor the entree, I chose the Seared Sea Scallops with Parsnip Potato Puree, Apple Cider Beurre Blanc, Crispy Prosciutto & Fried Parsnip Strips. When I dine out, I often try to stay away from beef, even though I love it, because I am usually disappointed after being spoiled with the my husband's cooking. The scallops were the right choice. They were perfectly cooked--tender on the inside with a slight crisp on the outside--and the parsnip potatoes were rich and creamy. However, I also sampled the Grilled Veal Tenderloin, served with a Saut\u00e9 of Asparagus, Prosciutto & Maitake Mushrooms & Roasted Garlic Reduction Sauce. The veal was tender and succulent, cooked to perfection and complemented with the reduction sauce. Though not a traditional steakhouse, Rosemary's Roasted Filet of Beef stood up to the rest of the menu after being seasoned and cooked perfectly with a bourbon green peppercorn sauce, and complemented with horseradish souffle potatoes.\n\nFor dessert, I enjoyed the chef's special of the night--a Passion fruit cheesecake with pomegranate sauce. I also sampled a platter of miniature desserts, including a lemon bar, peanut butter crisp, and mint chocolate fudge. All were delicious, and the perfect cap to an excellent meal.\n\nIn addition to the fabulous food, the service was wonderful. The sommelier was attentive and helpful, as was our waitress. The waitstaff presented each course in sync, serving each dish at the same time and allowing ample time in between courses. Water and wine glasses were kept full, napkins placed gently on laps and every other need met graciously.\n\nOverall, Rosemary's provided one of the most exquisite meals I have ever enjoyed, and it is a Las Vegas restaurant not to be missed."

I've always ordered their prix fixe, which is one appetizer, one main course, and one dessert.   I usually prefer getting the BBQ shrimp for the starter, ribeye or pork chop for the meal, and the chocolate something for dessert.  They usually add in-between items between courses (I know there's a name for that) that are very tasty as well.  Last time we had chocolate strawberrys and various chocolates before (or was it after) dessert.   \n\nYou will leave this place full, and wonder why can't other restaurants be like this in Vegas.  \n\nOther things:  I'm not into service, generally, but they are very helpful, patient and kind.  Not snobby, very cool.\n\nThis last time I went there was a Gift card you could buy at Costco for them, so you might want to see if they still have that."

We sat here before our table was ready and we were lucky enough to catch happy hour (which goes till 7). The restaurant has 2 different rooms for seating (both connected though a doorway). Depending upon your mood you may want to make a request as to which one you prefer. The dining area with the kitchen in it is definitely quite a bit noisier. \n\nThe evening we went I somehow had a craving for pork. When our waiter told me that their \"12 oz. double cut grilled pork chop\" was his favorite I couldn't resist. It's the only item on the menu that has been consistently on the menu (since the restaurant opened 12 years ago.)  Even after I had the last bite I was still craving it.  My husband ordered the risotto starter and Tasso crusted salmon. Both were delicious. \n\nEntrees are pricey here ($37 range). They also offer a chef tasting menu ($80) and a fixed prix menu ($55). \n\nService overall here was exceptonal until the very end. Once we received dessert the waiter neglected to clear our dishes. Despite that lack of attention still a good experience."

Sure, it's boring on the outside, but who remembers the paper anyway?\n\nThe service was just shy of overly attentive. Every few sips of wine our glasses were refilled.

Seems like the dress of patrons was a bit on the overly-casual side also. The times that we've gone before the color of the napkin was given depending on the diner's outfit (for example if wearing black or dark clothing, you would get a black napkin...white for lighter clothing)....this didn't happen this time. Also, we wondered what happened to the \"crumb scrapers\"? I'm sure these items have an actual name, but we like to call them \"crumb scrapers\"...the servers would use these little \"utensils\" in between courses to clean (scrape) crumbs off of the table. We didn't even see one used this time. Also, usually we can't touch the wine bottle w/o either the sommelier or other server coming over and taking it from us to pour. We poured our own wine a few times this trip, w/o notice. These are very small, trivial things, and really, they didn't change our overall experience at all....these are just things that we noticed.

It doesn't quite offer the \"show\" that is expected of fine dining in Las Vegas, but Rosemary's marksmanship with food presentation and service were dead on.\n\nOur party of four arrived a few minutes late for our reservation on a Sunday night, but were seated fairly promptly in the dining room off by the bar.  The server and his assistant were always on point, anticipating our every dining need.  Each of us opted for the three-course prix fixe dinner at $55 per meal, $65 if you wanted to upgrade entrees to rack of lamb or filet of beef.  Our servers started us off with Rosemary's tasty signature dinner rolls and some cocktails.  \n\nFor my dinner, I opted to start with one of the night's specials: a blended winter vegetable soup.  The taste and texture of the soup was wonderful, only to be heightened more so by the subtle scent of truffle oil drizzled as garnish on top of the soup.  The second course was seared bay scallops with a deliciously rich sauce.  My third course was the roasted rack of lamb, beautifully seared, served with a side of homemade mashed potatoes blended with fresh cut olives, a side of fried arugula and a signature bordelaise sauce.  Each course was presented so beautifully and cleanly.  By the end of dinner, we all barely had room for dessert but eventually prevailed to at least taste some of it.\n\nRosemary's is definitely a restaurant I'd like to visit again on my next trip to Vegas, and would certainly recommend this to others!"

From the outside, it is in a non-descript strip mall far removed from the lights and glitter of the Las Vegas Strip. It almost felt like going to a Hometown Buffet. But dont let the looks from the outside fool you.\n\nInside, you are greeted by a warm atmosphere - an elegant bar to the right, and a large dining area, with a view of the kitchen.\n\nThe food was delicious. Everyone there is professional. Excellent wine list.\n\nHighly recommended."

My soup was a garlic parmesan with shaved chives, a special of the day.  Hubby had the scallops.  Both were excellent.\nFor entrees I had the daily special of a salmon over risotto....melt in your mouth and creamy....made me moan with the tastes it evoked.  Hubby had a fantastic veal chop over swiss chard.  Dessert was also very good, but I prefer the quality and the uniqueness of the food rather than the sweet stuff.\n\nWaiters Joe and Matt were very helpful with information to guide our decision making as so many items sounded like what we would like.  Service overall was top notch....someone always there but without the hovering we have had in some places.  And on duty also was a very pleasant, helpful maitre'd.\n\nIt's one of the few restaurants we have gone to in Las Vegas where the meal is memorable and we know we will continue to return.\n\nYou can't beat the fixed price of $55 for 3 courses, especially when you will be getting top notch quality.  Comfortable seating, tables nicely spaced so it's not noisy.  Make recommendations to be sure of getting in.\n\nIt's a pricey cab ride from the strip...about $30...but if you have a car, don't miss going to Rosemary's.\n\nSorry I never wrote a yelp review all these 8 years, but after last night's meal I just had to submit my highest recommendation."

If you dine between 5 and 7, all food AND drink is 50% off. Insane! (PS - guys can dine with you, they just won't get the 50% discount). Apparently word is out because this place was crawling with cougars - meow ! If cougars are your type this is where they are hiding on Wednesdays. \n\nOn to the food... The 5 course chef's tasting menu for freaking $40 (a steal!) was too tempting to pass up. My mom and husband both got the 3 course ($55 for my husband and $27.50 for my mom). \n\nChef's tasting:\n\n*Beef tartare - high quality but had too much wasabi for my taste\n*Salmon crusted with proscuitto over cheddar mashed potatoes plated in a bloody mary butter (yup, the bloody mary butter is as insanely good as it sounds!!)\n*BBQ shrimp - one of Rosemary's classics\n*Lamb chops glazed in balsalmic sauce.. MMMM\nthen an insane dessert consisting of a lambic raspberry float, a mini creme brulee, and a chocolate cake ! All were perfect and incredible. Then came the kahlua brownies, lemon squares and peanut butter buckeyes!!\n\nOh I did add on the wine tasting too and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of wines they gave me. Normally I don't do wine pairings because I hate the wines they include, but the wines were interesting, unique, and of high quality at Rosemary's!\n\nService was impeccable without being snobby ! Glad to know their quality seems consistent from visit to visit unlike many places I've tried on the strip."

It's very intimate with simple decorations and candles...a far cry from the gratuitous luxury of the strip.  The food was DELICIOUS...I still think about the steak and the tartare...  The wait staff were incredible though, so friendly (but not up in our business).  We were there for a friend's birthday and they actually hooked us up with a limo to drive us around the strip for awhile.  It was such a nice night, I definitely recommend taking one day from your vacation for a quiet and and beautiful dinner...and then afterwards you head right back to get your PARTY OOON!"

This was 5 years ago when Rosemary's was still paying an exorbitant rent in the Rio.\n\nThey have since moved 6 miles out away from the strip on Sahara/Cimmaron in a strip mall between Steinmart and the Dollar Tree. But, don't let this unassuming location fool you-- Rosemary's is the real deal and was voted Best Restaurant in NEVADA 2007 for a reason.\n\nSentimental us, we had to go back for a visit while in town for a trade show.  I can tell you that I also came back for the goat cheese cheesecake, but left loving the twice baked parmesan souffle in a garlic cream sauce the best. My husband and I opted for the $55 prix fixe menu which included 3 courses of your choice.\n\n\nHubs ordered:\n* Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp w/Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw\n* Grilled Pork Chop w/Hoppin' John & Creole Mustard Reduction Sauce\n* A side of cheese grits(exra dish outside prix fixe)\n* Carrot Cake (deconstructed and delicious)\n\n\nI ordered:\n* Twice Baked Parmesan Souffle w/Golden Chanterelles & Roasted Garlic Cream\n* Brick Chicken w/Haricots Vert, Shoestring Potatoes & Dijonaisse Sauce\n* Goat Cheese Cheesecake\n\n\nThe 2 things I loved the most were the cheese grits and the parmesan souffle. Maybe that says something about my love for comfort food, I'm not sure. But both of these dishes simply melt in your mouth and are the best in their class.\n\nI should also mention the service-- a little stiff, but overall excellent. When dining out, I don't want stuffy-- I want an experience, I want to hear stories, I want to know WHY the food got on the menu. I really hope Rosemary's doesn't lose it's charm that they've been known for in trying to defend themselves against arrogant, snobbish foodies who tend to miss the point.\n\nFair warning- this is a $30 cab ride one way from the strip (+tip). And it was worth every penny."

It was worth far more than every penny.\n\nI highly reccomend the shrimp appetizer, mahi mahi, and pecan tart dessert.

The mahi mahi was out of this world and the pecan tart measured up to any I've had ever before.\n\nGo here."

            "review": "What in the world took me so long to find this place??? I can't believe all of this time I have overlooked this gem of a restaurant because of the location. It is in a strip mall shared by Marie Callendars after all. Upon the advice of friends and the reluctance to want to fight traffic and parking on the strip, I visited this fine establishment for my anniversary. We arrived early for our reservations and sat at the bar to get a drink. The dirty martini I ordered was spot on perfection! It wasn't too salty or too watered down, just strong and perfect. The bartender was so warm and friendly, asking us if it were our first time dining there. We told her yes and she started rattling off suggestions for our dinner. We ordered another drink each (since it was happy hour in the bar) and followed the hostess to our table. The service was impeccable! From the moment we sat down to the moment we left, the staff made us feel that they were only there to serve us, despite the busy dining room. The chefs, knowing it was our anniversary sent out various complimentary tastings. We were served a small portion of grits (yay! i love me some grits) with wild mushrooms and shaved cheese. It was mouth watering deliciousness. Next we got a vegetable bread pudding bite with a bell pepper jelly that was equally exceptional. The appetizers we ordered came out and the suggestion from the bartender held true- the BBQ shrimp were beyond comparison. The shrimp were grilled to the point of perfect doneness, the outside was crispy and the inside still moist and mild. The BBQ sauce itself was the star of the dish, it was tangy and sweet and spicy all at the same time- perfectly balanced flavor. Although the hubby wouldn't dare try the cole slaw, I was more than eager to relieve him of it. It was maytag blue cheese after all! It was so creamy and tart, a perfect complement to the tangy BBQ sauce and shrimp. I ordered the raw trio appetizer (sorry can't remember the name), beef tar-tar, ahi tuna and smoked salmon. The beef literally melted in my mouth with a blend of spices that harmonized with the rich raw meat. The smoked salmon had capers which I appreciated and the tuna was satisfying as well. For entrees we ordered 2 red meat options since we wanted to share and the hubby won't eat most fish or lamb. I ordered the Grilled Flank Steak w/Roasted Garlic Creamers, Crystal Fried Onion Crust, & Rosemary's Steak Sauce. At first I was disappointed that the rib eye wasn't on the menu that night because I am a BIG fan of rib eyes, however the flank steak swept any disappointment away after the first bite. The texture of the steak was soft and tender, the taste was heavenly. The sauce on this dish was again a star! The hubby got the Grilled Veal Porterhouse w/Swiss Chard, Caramelized Red Onions & Bourbon Green Peppercorn Sauce. The sauce on his was tasty too, but he much preferred the sauce from the flank steak. I liked the bitter swiss chard element on his plate, it provided a nice contrast to the buttery velvet veal. After our entrees the waiter brought out a complimentary dessert plate with 6 little bites of sweets. There was a lemon bar, a brownie and a buckeye. I cursed myself for giving up desserts for lent! My hubby got to enjoy them all by himself. Once he tried one of each he sat back and declared the buckeye was the best dessert he had ever eaten. He doesn't even like peanut butter, but was proclaiming his love for the little treat. He told me to try it, even though I had managed to make it almost to Easter without breaking my lent vows. I fought back the temptation and told him to go ahead and finish it, which he quickly obliged. The whole night he couldn't stop talking about that buckeye. After all was said and done, our bill came to about $130 with tip and we left on Cloud 9. I am in love with this restaurant and can't wait to go back and try all of there creations!"

As soon as you walk through the doors, you are greeted by friendly young girls and an impressive bar. After waiting about 10 minutes (after our reservation time) to be seated, I was again surprised to see the white tablecloths and formally attired waiters. We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks, but waited too long for our menus (about 10 min) We  took advantage of the \"prixe fix\", where you order 3 courses of your choice for $55. Wednesday is Ladies Night, so I got my meal for half off! Great deal!  I ordered the BBQ shrimp (yummy, and perfectly cooked) and the beef carpaccio as my appetizer and salad. I didn't know what carpaccio was, but the waiter explained it so elegantly that I ordered it. It's basically, really thin sliced raw beef with chunks of bleu cheese sprinkled on them. Eh, I'm not that gourmet, so I didn't really like it, but maybe someone who has a more refined palette would. My husband ordered the crab boulettes, which, in English, are crab cakes shaped into balls. They were okay...more breading than crab. We did get a \"gift\" from the chef which was a ceviche type salad on a piece of wonton. We liked it, maybe more so because we were so hungry? \n\nMy entree was Alaskan Halibut...yummm! Perfectly cooked and a generous portion. My husband ordered the rib eye. Again, perfectly cooked and seasoned. This came with grits (no flavor and kind of mushy)...potatoes would have been better. \n\nI didn't order a dessert since my entree made 3 choices. My husband ordered the coconut bread pudding. I do not like coconut, but I really liked this dessert! Deeelicious! We also got another \"gift\" from the chef which was a sampler of a cookie, a brownie and a lemon bar. They all had fancier names, but that's how I labeled them. They were all delicious! And not just cuz they were free! \n\nOverall, Rosemary's was a unique and pleasant experience. You need to have a LOT of time to dine there. Our reservations were for 8:30 and we did not leave there until 10:30. And that was not due to drinking and conversing, either. I'm all for enjoying my dining experience without feeling rushed, but this was a bit too slow for me.  That is why they get the 4 instead of a full 5 stars. \n\nI would go again on Ladies Night or with a coupon because otherwise, it's a bit expensive."

Too bad they don't offer an appetizer portion for these, because I think they as a whole were better than the apps on the menu.\n\nLike Misti has mentioned in her review, the food here is a little hit or miss.  I tried the 5-couse Chef's Tasting menu on my first visit.  The Fourst Course: Roasted Rackof Lamb was great. The First Course: Duo of Tartars (Filet of Beef was good, the Salmon Tartar was way too salty) was okay. The Second Course: PanFried VealSweetbreads w/ Foie Gras Butternut Squash Quinoa (sweetbread was probably way too over-fried, but the quinoa and the Bloody Mary Butter Sauce was really good). Third Course: Yellow Fin Tuna on Andouille, was okay. Fifth Course: Dessert Trio was uninspiring.\n\nI have also tried other items from the regualr and daily menu. Likely it was good or so-so.  Below are a brief review of what I have tried:\n\nPanko Crusted Crab Boulettes w/ G-ma's Sweet & Sour Cucumbers & Emulsified Ravigote Sauce $15 - Pretty good. \n\nBaked Crab Stuffed Shrimp w/ Apricot Hollandaise & Herb tossed Pea Shoots $14.50 - Kind of hard to eat (messy), but the shrimp and crab were good. Didn't like apricot in this dish.\n\nHugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp w/ Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw. $14 - Overall, alittlesalty for me.  Good Maytag Blue Cheese flavor on the slaw, shrimp was cooked cook (probably be better if it was seared on the grill quickly and not cooked all the way through), not a fan of the \"sauce\".\n\nTwice Baked Parmesan Souffl\u00e9 w/ Wild Mushrooms in a Roasted Garlic Cream Sauce. $14 - Good Souffl\u00e9, love the wildmushroom in roasted garlic cream sauce.  If you like souffl\u00e9 then I highly recommend this hot app.\n\nSeared Sea Scallops w/ Parsnip Potato Puree, Crispy Prosciutto, Parsnip Strips & Apple Cider Beurre Blanc $36  - One of my scallops was starting to have that off-flavor, but it was cooked perfectly. The parsnip strips was a great garnish.\n\nDuck \"Corned Beef\" & Mustard Braised White Cabbage w/ Roasted Garlic Reduction Sauce. $37  Overall, it was good, but the sauce was too salty for me.\n\nFrom what I have heard, Rosemary's was a really excellent restaurant when it first started, but it has lost some of the shine since then.  Too bad I wasn't here to try it back then, but it is still a nice little neighorhood restaurant to enjoy a good meal and good service.\n\nThe reason I am only giving it 3 stars on Yelp (A-Ok) is that for this kind of restaurant it is just okay compared to others in its class.  Service is what you expect from similar quality fine dining restaurants.  Price is average compared to its peers.  Taste - have items I truly enjoyed and others that I will not order again.  Probably the best deal here is Lady's night and happy hour pricing on drinks.\n\nDecor:  4/5 Dimly lit for that intimate and romantic atmosphere.  Seats are comfortable.\nFood:  3/5 Hits and misses, sauces are on the salty side for my taste.\nLocation:  3/5 Perfect for locals living on the SW side of LV.  Cab fares will add up for those staying on the Strip.\nPrice: 3/5  AVerage compared to similar quality restaurants.\nService: 3/5  Knowledgable staff providing good service."

The events and catering director, Jennifer, was friendly, experienced, accessible, and super helpful.  She remembered our group's last visit, which was 5 years ago, and was able to immediately send me the menus and information from last time. The menu she put together for me presented a nice variety of options (they offered far more entree options for the set menu than other restaurants would have offered for a group this size), and they were able to accommodate special requests as well as late additions and late arrivals.  There were absolutely no mixups with orders and requests and the waitstaff was professional and courteous, timing of the service was perfect (also, I noticed that four waiters would coordinate so all 8 people at each round table had their food placed in front of them at the exact same time), and our drinks and wine glasses stayed full the whole time.  \n\nEveryone thought the food was excellent and kept talking about it!  The goat cheese salad, halibut, lamb chops with quinoa, creme brulee, and chocolate cream pie dessert with ice cream seemed to be the most popular options and they all got especially enthusiastic reviews!

I celebrated my 25th birthday at Rosemary's Restaurant, and had a wonderful time with my husband. \n\nWe chose the $55 prie fixe menu since it was a great deal. It was so hard to decide on which items you can choose since there are a lot of options on the menu! I chose the appetizer, main entr\u00e9e, and dessert route. My husband chose the 2 appetizers and main entr\u00e9e route. \nThe complimentary bread is so good! There was a white roll and a walnut raisin roll. Yum! I could eat the walnut raisin roll everyday, especially since the rolls were warm.\n\nFor appetizer we had the following: \n1) Warm Mozzarella Crepe with Tomato Vinaigrette and Pea Sprouts and Popcorn Fried Morel Mushrooms (Special of the day) - The crepe was really delicious with the mozzarella cheese inside. The morel mushrooms were interesting. The batter was really light, so I wouldn't consider it as \"popcorn fried.\" \n\n2) Pan Fried Veal Sweetbreads - Wow! This was yummy. The sweetbreads were very tender. It's one of the best sweetbreads that I've eaten.\n\n3) Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes with Sour Cucumbers - This is the Rosemary's version of a crab cake. The texture was a bit mushy to me, but you can taste the crab. There wasn't a lot of carb fillers either. I prefer the other two appetizers over this one.\n\nWe also received an amuse busche of a vegetable lasagna which was complimentary of the chef.\n\nFor the main entr\u00e9e we had the following:\n1) Pan Fried Soft Shell Crab on bed of Chanterelle Mushroom and Fingerling Potatoes with Sweet Corn (Special of the day) - The dish is presented beautifully with the crab on top of the mushrooms and potatoes. The batter was very light, and everythign tasted great! I always like to eat chanterelle mushrooms. \n\n2) Roasted Rack of Lamb - Oh goodness. The lamb was very tender and cooked medium rare. The portion of the lamb was very generous. I love the balsamic reduction sauce. I soaked up every bit of sauce with the lamb. I'm not a fan of olives, so I didn't enjoy the mashed potatoes too much. \n\nAt this time, I was extremely full, but there is always room for desserts! I ordered the following as my birthday treat:\n\n1) Rustic Apple Tart with candied walnuts and cinnamon ice cream -MmMMm.. the dessert was so good! I was also thrilled that the pastry chef wrote \"Happy Birthday\" on the plate. Love the extra touches that the restaurant gives. I love how the apple tart came in a tiny puff pastry. It wasn't what I expected since I thought it would be a mini pie. The dessert also came with a butter cookie underneath the ice cream.This is definitely a sweet dish but very good.\n\nWe also received a complimentary dessert from chef:\n1)  Fudge brownie which is really rich\n2)  Lemon tart\n3) Two peanut butter balls - They reminded me of eating a really rich and soft Reese's peanut butter cup.\n\nThe service was great, and food was delicious. Highly recommended place in Las Vegas!"

Attentive, without hovering, friendly, knowledgeable and obviously very well trained - Not once did anyone say \"How ya guys doing tonight?' I HATE THAT!!! I overheard one of the other Wait Staff telling of the history of Rosemary's and how the restaurant was named after the owner's Mother and how they had moved to the present location about 9 years ago, etc. I LOVE stuff like that!\n\nWe opted for the 3-course prix fixe menu and splurged on a bottle of wine - an Australian sauvignon blanc that we'd had before - since it was 1/2 price. We did try the signature Texas BBQ shrimp even though the thought of shrimp paired with blue cheese seemed...odd... and it was FABULOUS! The warm white chocolate dinner rolls (yes, white chocolate) were orgasmic; Katie even tucked 4 extra into a box for us to take back to our hotel to have with our coffee in the morning. WOW, a sweet reminder of the night before.\n\nRosemary's is romantic and the dining room was dimly lit. If I had to say one negative thing, it's a very minor negative, the portions are really generous, so show up hungry if you decide on the 3-course or 5-course prix fixe menus. We didn't have room for dessert but a small plate of sweets came at the end of our meal: 2 dark chocolate truffles, 2 lemon squares and 2 buckeyes. A perfect ending.\n\nI'd give Rosemary's more stars but Yelp only goes up to 5 and I'd give 5 stars just for the service alone. When we go back, and we will, I hope Justin and Katie are still there."

It's located in a random strip mall but the interior is classy, yet warm and comfortable enough to assure you that you're no longer amidst the gaudy extravagance of the Strip. \n\nThe prix fixe meal is a steal, $55 for a 3-course dinner of your choice, when most a la carte entrees are already over $30.  By going prix-fixe you're getting way more food than you would be for the same prices elsewhere.\n\nDinner started off with an amuse bouche and 2 fresh, soft dinner rolls.  I ordered the ham and crawfish risotto, sweet corn soup, and halibut lindquist.  The halibut was fantastic, I was already stuffed by the time I finished my soup but I forced down the entire dish just for the taste of it, and I still enjoyed it.  Other outstanding dishes that I stole several bites of: seared sea scallops, duck confit (daily special), and the ribeye steak.\n\nService is so polite and attentive that the water level in my glass never fell below 2/3 at any point in the meal without getting filled again.\n\nIf you're visiting Vegas and only have enough budgeted for one nice meal, skip the steakhouses and buffets and go to Rosemary's instead!"

The only thing I wish I knew about the place was its specials: Wednesdays are ladies night where you get 50% off food and happy hour prices for drinks.  So if you're a lady and available on Wednesday, this is a great bargain!  Sundays are half off bottled wines!  Next time we're in Vegas, I'll be sure to take advantage of these specials."

For only $25 at lunch, you get a choice of an appetizer, a main course, and dessert.  you'd think you would only have a minimal selection in each couse, but actually there are quite a bit of choices and any specials of the day can be included.  i mean there are things like bbq shrimp, butternut squash soup for starters.  there are grilled mah-mahi, filet kabobs (which my lovely date enjoyed), and stuffed eggplant for entrees.  Finally, they have chocolate flourless cake, creme brulee, and coconut bread pudding.\nmy favorite appetizer that i recommend anybody to start with is the dry aged beef with maytag blue cheese carpaccio with a arugula & granny smith apple salad and dabbled with candied walnuts.  if you get each item in your mouth it's just a wonderful medley.\ni always follow with the really really crispy leg of duck confit on a bed of lentils with brandy green peppercorn sauce.   i just love the crispiness and saltiness of the meat.  i just wish they would put another duck leg in there for all the lentils they put on that dish.  \nusually i end the meal w/a very light dessert like the trio of sorbet, but this time i decided to go heavy with the goat cheesecake.  it had a lot more kick because of strong flavor of the goat cheese and was sweetened up by the scotch caramel sauce.\nmy lovely date, also pointed out that the service was \"amazingly fabulous!\"  they work as a team.  they are very attentive to pushing your chair in, folding your napkins when you leave, refilling your water, delivering your food, and setting up your table.\ni highly recommend this place to anybody who lives or is visiting Vegas..."

Must try if you love blue cheese and bbq sauce\nMarinated Jumbo Asparagus-Good, like a fancy breakfast salad\nDuo of Tartars-Very good!  I didn't try the beef but the salmon was amazing\nMoroccan Spiced Sea Scallops-Perfectly cooked and seasoned\nNightly Special Beef Filet-Amazing! \nChocolate Cream Pie-So good I will go back to Vegas just for this dessert\n\nIn addition to the fantastic meal we ordered, the staff brought us a few small dishes to taste, the first was a savory bread pudding that was excellent, and the second was a trio of desserts: lemon bars, mini peanut butter cookie bites and chocolate coconut bars which were all delicious (my favorite were the chocolate coconut bars).  Also, the portions were very generous which is not always the case with fine dining.  Our server, Thomas was super helpful and knowledgeable.

Every time we're in town (we live in LA) this is a must for us ... we used to come at least once for lunch and once for dinner - however they stopped serving lunch except for Fridays :( It's a bit off the strip but so well worth it ... everyone MUST eat here!!! I swear, I died and went to heaven!! Don't let the strip mall fool ya, this is by far my FAVE restaurant EVER!! \n\nWe always do either the pre fix menu or the tasting ($55 per person). Love that Wednesdays is \"ladies night\" and ladies get 1/2 off! Oh, and if you sit at the bar, they have a different tapas menu which is aaaaaaamazing!! The food is superb, the staff is top notch (we love that one of the waiters always remembers us! haha makes us feel like we're at home!). \n\nIf you've read my reviews, you know I eat ... a lot!! hahah So my sis and I both did the prefix .. we split our 1st dish - she ordered the beef carpaccio (to die for ... we've been to France and this is served slightly different with blue cheese, apples and candied walnuts) and I ordered the twice baked souffle (our first time ordering this and it was delish! wild mushrooms with a beautiful parmesan souffle - so light and fluffy). She ordered the special appetizer beef tartar (we split it as our 2nd course) ... ohhhhhh myyyyyyy goshhhhhh, I know some people get creeped out with raw beef, but if you enjoy it and it's on the menu for the night - you have to try it ... you won't be disappointed ... i think it became my fave appetizer from here!! For our entree, she had the lamb (cooked perfectly, so tasty and love the sauce) - I had the special salmon that had a bit of a citrus-y glaze to it, over a bed of apple slaw. I ordered the special dessert - blackberry cobbler that we split, unfortunately this was the least favorite thing I've had here ... I like my cobblers to have a thick crumbly biscuit/topping and this just had little chunks of dough mixed in and the blackberries were a bit overpowering for this dish since the seeds get quite chewy. So, since we didn't want to end a fabulous meal with an average dessert, we ordered another one to split! :) Our fave dessert is the ice box cooler but they didn't have it that night so we had the trio of sorbets - they have the best sorbets and ice creams!! \n\nI have never been disappointed with this place and highly recommend it!! This makes me want to change any other place I've rated a 5 to a 4! It's as good as it gets, fine dining, great ambiance and a very reasonable price. If I lived in Vegas, I'd go every Wednesday for ladies night 1/2 off!!"

They seated us quickly (with reservation). Nice interior atmosphere, romantic. Good rolls too. \n\nCons: My husband got food poisoning. Thankfully, we did not share much foods, but we have narrowed it down to either the salad or steak. 5 hours after leaving he was in the bathroom all night. Which is a big bummer considering it was his birthday dinner and I surprised him with this restaurant. \nMy entree was a pork chop, and I ordered it from the yelp recommendations and server. I didn't care for it. It was flavored well but the dish seemed cheap. Pork chops are not a nice cut of meat, and it was served with a bean/rice and bacon dish. Bacon is a cop out for flavor. I should have ordered seomthing else because I was expecting so much more.\nAlso, the service is slow. We were really waiting for our entree, 2nd course and even the check for sometime, he was beginning to get annoyed. We ordered everything in advance, so I really don't know what took so long between courses. \nWe also were seated next to the kitchen's in/out door, which they covered with glass but still not a pretty view from many angles. I noticed several tables seated further away probably also had this view. Its a pet peeve of mine to be at a upscale restaurant and see the kitchen and wait staff in the back. \nAlso, there is a very limited menu. It was fine with me, but if you find yourself with a picky eater, this could be trouble. \n\nWe will not be going back, mainly because of the food poisoning."

($50 each) He said if we had had seperate tables they would have accepted both. No where on our certificates did it say that you could only use one per table. It said one per visit and this was our first time visiting (2 seperate couples). We were very frusterated since we had notified them of these prior to starting our dinner. It is not cheap to eat here and our bill was almost $300!  The manager did not even come to the table to explain which was somewhat odd. It did leave a bad taste in all our mouths since everything up to that point had been perfect! We did not understand how if we had got them as gifts and dined together it could not be used. They need to change their verbage to one per table per visit if they is what they mean. Also, make sure that if you notify the waiter they look at what you have first to eliminate the suprise at the end of your meal.\n\nOther than that though, this place was a wonderful place to dine.

It tasted great but was a little strained to eat thinking about the canned dog food. Monday's are great they offer all their wines at 1/2 price. If you go in any other day and want to order wine be prepared to pay $40.00 and above for a bottle of wine. If you bring in your own they have a $25.00 corkage fee. All in all I think in todays times you could do much better. Our dinner with wine came to $400.00 for a party of 4. A little pricey for what you get"

Walked inside to find a very clean and fancy/romantic atmosphere. Was able to seat 12 of us no problem when we went for a Father's Day dinner.\n\nThe service at Rosemary's was incredible. Waiters/waitresses would pull your chairs out for you or put your napkins on your lap. When serving dinner all meals would come out at the exact same time, literally. The waiters would wait until they were in position and then place all of our dishes in front of us at the exact same time. Because my family had been there occasionally before (Parents went on their own several times), the chef made our table an extra appetizer for everyone as well as extra dessert. \n\nFood was delcious. Depending on what you order you may get a small portion that is rich in flavor like I did with the seared scallops. As an appetizer I had their signature BBQ shrimp dish which was very tasty and tangy. The dessert definitely sealed the deal on the meal with the Banana Cheesecake that had a touch of fosters caramel on it. \n\nThe only downside I can find in this place is the pricing, but if you're going there I can only assume you know you will be paying quite a bit for dinner. The best deal is probably going for their Pree-fixe meal for $50 and getting any appetizer, main course, and dessert.\n\nDefinitely worth going to if you happen to be in the Vegas area."

This is definitely one of Las Vegas' best kept secrets.\n\nMy girlfriend and I had reservations at 7:15, but we arrived at about 6:15 to take advantage of happy (4-7 everyday) hour. The service was impeccable -- and we were sitting at a bar table. We had two appetizers -- the sweet corn soup is amazing -- and six cocktails for around $70 including tip.\n\nThe staff at this restaurant is absolutely amazing. One would've thought that we were at a much more expensive restaurant. Our chairs were pulled out for us when we were seated, my girl friend was given a black napkin to better match her dark dress, and those napkins were folded for us before we returned from using the restrooms.\n\nThe food follows the impeccable service. Every thing melts in your mouth from the bread to the main course to dessert. The staff is very helpful offering opinions on menu options, and every menu item is paired with both a beer and wine selection that goes best with it.\n\nMy girlfriend had been here before, and she knew of the amazing peanut butter buckeyes offered for dessert -- free of charge. Were talking about them when our server came to the table, and she offered to get us the restaurant's cookbook. I've never been to any other restaurant that has offered to share their recipes with their customers.\n\nAlthough I couldn't see coming here on a daily bases due the higher prices compared to chain restaurants, for example,  I will definitely be returning as you definitely get your money's worth and then some.\n\nThere are only two minor down sides. The first is that reservations are a must. There are also tables available in the bar section that are reserved. We saw at least two couples that had to be politely turned away on a busy friday night because they did not have reservations. Secondly, the main dinning room was a bit on the cold side. This is likely due to the fact that the kitchen opens up to the dinning room -- which is another amazing feature of this restaurant."

What a night!\n\nWe all went for the $55 prix fixe - what a deal! Each of us ordered something different, and we sampled and shared our dishes. Collective voting placed the prosciutto-wrapped figs and goat cheese and the shrimp with blue cheese slaw in a tie for best appetizer. Entrees were not voted on, as everyone felt that their individual choice was the best (three veal tenderloins, and one each salmon, rib eye and striped bass).  My wife saved one of her three course choices for dessert, and she ordered the lemon ice box cake and graciously requested six forks!\n\nThe excellent wine list was a bit pricey but we found a very good Pinot Noir at the low end of the list. They also have an \"Under $50\" list which doesn't show up on the web site.  On our next visit to Vegas, I would go on a Sunday night (half-price wine) to explore some of the pricier bottles. \n\nAll in all it was a fabulous meal, with service to match. (Thank you, Tony!) Every dish was meticulously seasoned and plated - and tasted as good as it looked.  When I got back to Chicago I ordered three copies of their cookbook as Christmas gifts. I'm now telling all my friends that Rosemary's should be your #1 Las Vegas dining destination."

Although it was a Tuesday, we witnessed a few couples walk in and were informed they could not be seated for at least an hour and a half. However, there is bar and small lounge area where you can enjoy a cocktail and appetizers while you wait to be seated. We dressed \"business casual\" but we did see some casually dressed diners. \n\nThe service was excellent and the wait staff truly works as a team to ensure your dining experience is as pleasant as possible. The food was fantastic and our bill was about $120 (we each opted for the appetizer+entree+dessert prix fixe meal at $55 a piece). We used $100 in gift certificates that only cost $80 at Costco(in Summerlin or you can order them online). \n\nI highly recommend the Tasso Ham & Crawfish Risotto hot appetizer. Our entire meal was great, but this risotto dish was the star of the night along with the creamy mash potatoes (with kalamata olives) that accompanied my tasty rack of lamb. It was superb. My wife and I had expectations that were greatly exceeded. Additionally, ending the meal with the tart and refreshing lemon box dessert only escalated this dining experience. Certainly worth the money and drive as it is only minutes from the strip."

Excellent wine list and an interesting vegetable quick amuse bouche started the evening off well.\nWe opted not to do the prix fixe menu and ordered two salads, two entrees, and shared a dessert so the cost came out about the same.  My wife had the arrugula, endive, and radicchio salad and I had the wilted spinach withshallots and goat cheese.  Both were intresting and worth repeating.  She had the sea scallops with parsnip potato puree and apple cider beurre and they were excellent.  I had the veal tenderloin with fingerling potatoes and green peppercorn sauce.  A nice sized piece of veal cooked medium-rare but the sauce was overpowering.\nWe shared a lemon ice box (?) dessert in a martini glass with berries and whipped cream.  Way too sweet and tart and I would not recommend it."

Well...IT'S WORTH IT! GO! \n\nI almost downgraded Rosemary's to 4 stars only because, if anything, the service can be spotty. If it's not the hostess or Maitre'd, it's the server, or inattentive wait staff. But, the food is the main event and what a delicious show it is. And a rarefied bargain at $55 for the prix fixe dinner. And for that added 'oomf!'...trust them on their wine selections. \n\nI categorize the food as continental with a french emphasis--definitely fine dining. Rosemary's can't be considered an insider's culinary find anymore it is just too good not be discovered. Thank you Chef Michael and Wendy Jordan!"

A couple people in our group had been to Rosemary's before and recommended it. But we were pulling up to a strip mall. We were going to be having the celebratory wedding dinner in a strip mall? Enter confusion. Though only for a few minutes until we got inside.\n\nSince we had a large group, we were eating off a predetermined menu with a couple choices for each course. Wine was ordered, poured, and drunk happily by the masses at the table. This is the kind of place where all the meals are served simultaneously. For our large party, that meant around 10 servers each holding two plates, and putting the meals down in unison. It's a touch that you don't necessarily want every time you go out, but one that screams class, definitely appropriate for the wedding dinner. The food was excellent. The service was superb. Definitely worth the trip off the strip for dinner."

            "review": "Our dinner at Rosemary's Restaurant was a huge disappointment.  I chose this restaurant based on yelp reviews and I really felt betrayed. \n\nMy husband and I went here on Father's day.  Our server told us about the 1/2 price bottles of  wine - which immediately put us in a good mood. My husband got the tasting menu and I went with the Prix Fixe menu. L'amuse bouche was goat cheese mousse on fried wonton - which was rather unimpressive - but it didn't taste bad, it just tasted as described. Next came beef tartar for my husband and beef carpaccio for me. The salad that came with the beef carpaccio tasted like the Field of Greens salad at CPK - again, it tasted good but seemed unoriginal and umimpressive.  Additionally, I didn't see the point of having the beef in this beef carpaccio - blue cheese and the sweetness of the salad dressing completely overpowered whatever beef was doing in there. My husband didn't say much about the beef tartar - which leads me to believe it was forgettable.  Then came sweetbreads for me and the Hugo BBQ shrimp for my husband. As others have commented here previously, the shrimp dish was good. Nothing about it said \"fine dining\" but it was good. These were followed by striped bass for my husband and baramundi for me. This was the beginning of the downhill portion of the evening. The barramundi I ordered was way over-salted where I could see the grains of salt completely covering the skin of the fish and the sauce on which the cabbage slaw and the fish were sitting was also extremely salty.  I took a few bites, but it literally was inedible.  This was the final dish of my Prix Fixe meal but my husband still had the rack of lamb to go. The lamb was well cooked - only dish of our meal that had a pleasing presentation. After mere one bite, my husband said \"this doesn't taste like it was tasted before it was brought out.\" He said that the lamb and the Bordelaise sauce was way too salty and simply inedible.  At this point of our meal, I was extremely sad.  I really felt betrayed by yelp and just sad that I didn't stick with one of the famous chefs' restaurants on the stip but instead came to this suppsed \"hidden gem.\"  I was so upset and disappointed that I couldn't even look at the server. When she asked how we liked our main courses, we answered honestly and for consolation prize she gave us free coffee and a piece of cheesecake. Which to me was rather offensive - considering how they served inedible dishes and they thought it will all be OK with some unoriginal, uninspired cheesecake?  \n\nI felt that this restaurant should be classified as wannabe fine dining.  In addition to some of the food being inedible, there was serious lack of attention to detail which I couldn't overlook.  For example, flour-less chocolate cake had a piece of walnut shell on it - which my husband discovered when he took a bite of the cake.  When coffee was poured, our server filled the cup to the brim - was I at a diner? Did she think I was going to drink the cream straight out of the creamer? Portion of the kitchen is visible from the dining area.  While this concept is beautifully executed at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, at Rosemary's, you are literally looking into a commercial kitchen. Not only is it loud from pots and pans banging, it just isn't pretty nor interesting to look.  Lastly, this may actually be a positive for some, but the portion sizes were obscene. This was simply one more example of the recurring fault in our dinning experience at this restaurant - I felt that there was a lack of unity or integration of various aspects of the meal, which for me resulted in the failure to enjoy the meal both as individual components and as a whole.\n\nThis restaurant is not worth the trip if you are staying on the strip and we will never come back again."

So, for our first time, we decided to \"Go big or go home.\" (As my friend put it!)  We had one of everything and shared it all.  We chose to do the prix fixe menu.  This seemed like the best deal and in keeping with our mission statement to try everything.  And it was ladies night (50% off for ladies on food plus an 18% gratuity).\n\nHere's what we got:\n\nParmaesan souffle\n\nTexas BBQ shrimp - blue cheese coleslaw was so good.  very creamy and the shrimp was cooked perfectly and not chewy like some jumbo shrimp can be.\n\nCrab Boulettes - I was not a fan.  Bland.\n\nBeef & Maytag Blue Cheese Carpaccio Salad - Order this! so good if you love carpaccio and I definitely do!\n\nArugula, Endive & Radicchio - Excellent.  Basic salad\n\nSome other salad which was on the specials menu - Don't recall anything other than thinking it was good.\n\nMilk Fed Veal Porterhouse - I didn't try my friend's dish, but she professed her undying love to it.  Repeatedly.  So I assume it was good.\n\nSeared Sea Scallops - The scallops were cooked perfectly.  My friend had to keep stabbing me with her fork to keep me out of this.  The prosciutto really sent this over the edge into heavenly.  Very yummy.\n\nPrime NY Strip - This was excellent and a really big portion.  My friend had enough for lunch the next day.  This is one of the dishes which has an additional $5 surcharge on the prix fixe menu, but worth every penny.\n\nStriped bass - I ordered a bass dish off of the specials menu.  It had scallops and some sort of cream sauce.  I thought the fish was really well cooked but the scallops were kind of rubbery.  Especially when compared to my friends seared sea scallops.\n\nAlthough there were a few misses, overall I found Rosemary's to be pretty out of this world.  So glad I finally made it here.  It was nice to go to a nice restaurant off strip.  I get really tired of walking a mile in a casino for a great meal.  Four ladies, tons of food, copious amounts of alcohol and our total bill was $230.  My friends also ordered two desserts, but by that point I was out of commission.  Must have been good though, because it was all gone!"

But once you get into Rosemary's, you realize that it's the real deal. The ambiance of the room is pleasant, basically what you'd expect from a neighborhood fine dining restaurant. Even with the open kitchen, the room was moderately lit and fairly quiet, with a clientele of mainly couples in their fifties. The bar up front is small but perfect for couples waiting for other guests to join them, with a friendly bartender and probably the best selection of Belgium beers I've seen in the city.\n\nThe food we had was excellent, particularly the specials they had for the evening. My rib eye steak was delicious, though particularly fatty even for a rib eye. The other guests at our table really enjoyed their food as well, and we wanted to really like Rosemary's. Unfortunately the service was such that I doubt we'll be going back any time soon.\n\nTo be fair, it all came down to our particular server, who was surly, humorless and did everything he could to make us feel uncomfortable short of being overtly rude. The service systems they have in place are excellent (all the food is brought to the table at once, offering napkins to match clothing etc.), but when your server frowns, doesn't tell you the wine selections being brought to your table and generally does everything with a sneer, by the end of the meal what should have been a great experience becomes tainted to say the least.\n\nIt's a shame really, because a great fine dining restaurant off the strip is something we have been looking for. And Rosemary's could have been that place we would go back to again and again. But with so many choices in Las Vegas, we'll probably just keep on looking."

I had read about Rosemary's and liked some of the different dishes on their menu and so had booked a meal at this off Strip restaurant, allowing lots of time to get to Penn & Teller at the Rio for their evening performance.\n\nUnfortunately, the cab driver from my hotel had no idea where he was going and dropped me off in the wrong place. After 15 minutes of searching, I found out that I was in the wrong place, miles from the restaurant. As I hate being late for reservations, I rang Rosemary's to advise them about my delay and that I would try to get another cab. Well, I must have caught the companies at peak period and there wasn't a cab to be had for love nor money.\n\nAfter 30 minutes of increasingly desperate ringing, I rang Rosemary's back. The person on the end of the phone said not to worry and that they would try and get me a cab and they would ring me back. After 5 minutes, she rang back to say that they couldn't get a cab but that one of their regulars was on her way to pick me up!!!! A delightful lady duly arrived and we had a great natter in the car on the way over to the restaurant. What unbelievable service!\n\nAt the restaurant, they assured me that they would serve my food in time for me to catch my show and that they had already sorted out a cab for my trip to the Rio. If that was all they did, I would already be tempted to award them 5 stars for customer service above and beyond the call of duty alone.\n\nHowever, the food just reinforced the 5 star rating. I gather that Rosemary's used to be located at one of the big hotels - well, it's their loss. This food is vibrant, it's full of flavour, it's different and it's confident in itself.\n\nI plumped for the prix fixe dinner where there is a good choice of appetizers and entree with some choices attracting a supplementary charge. At my server's suggestion, I settled for one of the restaurant's signature appetizers - Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp. A flavourful interpretation of an old american favourite. I had the rack of lamb for entree and the meat was cooked perfectly. I'm afraid I can't remember the name of my dessert but a lovely sweet ending to the meal.\n\nAs it was such a fraught evening for me, the restaurant gave me some special home made chocolates to take away and enjoy at the show. Special people and definitely worth the trip off the Strip."

I come out to Vegas a few times a year for business and typically wind up in the over-priced packed and noisy restaurants on the strip. But you can do much better at Rosemary's.\n\nMy wife and I taxi'd out on a Sat. night (downside -- it's about 15-minute cab ride from the strip, so will cost $25-30 each way). As others note, the strip mall location is not impressive, but once you step inside you forget about that.\n\nI chose their Texas Shrimp appetizer, which was a bunch of bbq shrimp on a pile of coleslaw which had been mixed with bleu cheese. Fantastic, I'd go back for that alone. My entree was the pork chop, which was the only non-stellar part of the meal (it was however very good). Next time out, I'm going for the lamb chops. Dessert was fantastic, I got some kind of chocolate bomb. We waddled out to the taxi at the end of the meal.\n\nThe wait staff are very attentive and will take all the time you need to explain dishes to you.

And at $25, what a steal!  How could I resist?  I have already heard great things about this place by my Vegas go to man, so how can I say no?!  (I tried going on a weekend and only discovered then that they weren't open for lunch on weekends!  Wow!)  At Rosemary's, there is a good selection of starters, entrees, and desserts to choose from for the prix-fix menu, making this place an ideal choice for a variety of palates.\n\nTo start, I had the recommended Dry Aged Beef & Maytag Blue Cheese Carpaccio with Arugula & Granny Smith Apple Salad, Candied Walnuts & Port Wine Drizzles.  What a fabulous and light salad to start with!  The cheese is swirled into the beef and has an amazing mix of flavors going on in your mouth!  Yum yum!\n\nMy entree was the Soy Marinated Bistro Filet Kabobs with Prosciutto-Wild Mushroom Hash, Micro Greens & Caramelized Shallot Reduction Sauce.  The kabobs came on two skewer sticks.  They were small pieces of beef, but full of flavor.  The mix of mushrooms and greens complemented the dish well.  My companion had his favorite - the Crispy Leg of Duck Confit on a bed of French Green Lentils with a Brandy Green Peppercorn Sauce. The crispy skin of the duck was full of flavor, but the dish wasn't a particular favorite of mine.  I was more pleased with my beef kabobs.\n\nFor dessert, I closed with the Chocolate Flourless Cake with Scotch Caramel Sauce and Vanilla Ice Cream.  I noticed they were offering Peppermint Ice Cream in another dessert and asked if they could substitute the vanilla for peppermint and it was done!  The toasted almond slivers added a nice crunch to the cake and sweet ice cream.  The cookie underneath the ice cream also added a nice bite to the lovely dessert as well.  I was pleased with my choice!  My companion had the Goat Cheese Cheesecake with Scotch Caramel Sauce.  The goat cheese was a bit heavy for me, especially after my very filling starter and entree, so I was glad I stuck with my chocolate cake.  He seemed quite content with the stronger tasting and pungent dessert than I.\n\nService - amazingly fabulous!  Servers here are particularly anal and I love it!  The old school way of serving from the left and taking from the right applies here!  And my favorite - the waiters wait until all plates are present and they are set down in front of each diner at the same time.  Love it!  They also fold your napkin and push in your chair should you use the restroom during your meal.  This place works fabulously as a team and they get FIVE stars on service alone!  (This was just for lunch too!)  I can't wait to go back for more!\n\nSide note: Check out their website for various promotions going on like half price wine night on Sundays and ladies' night on Wednesdays, which means half off!  You can even purchase $100 GC for $79.99 at Las Vegas Costcos!\n\nUpdate!  02/02/08 - Had the pleasure of having their prix-fix lunch here again today and couldn't pass up the \"Dry Aged Beef & Maytag Blue Cheese Carpaccio with Arugula & Granny Smith Apple Salad, Candied Walnuts & Port Wine Drizzles.\"  It's so good that the BF and I each order our own plate.  (We usually like to get different things and share, but this one is so good we just want our own!)\n\nFor the main, I had the \"Creole Seasoned Shrimp with Anson Mills Carolina Cheesy Quick Grits, Andouille Red Bean Sauce & Grilled Green Onion.\"  It was so much food!  Embarrassingly, I couldn't finish it all!  Too much grits!  \n\nThe BF had \"Rosie's Monte Cristo - Ham, Turkey & Cantal Cheese on Battered Dipped Brioche with Crispy Onion Crust.\"  I especially liked his flaky and light onion rings.  Again, very plentiful and he couldn't finish it all either!\n\nThe BF ordered some kind of dessert that I forgot the name of.  The waiter said it was really good, but it was alright to us.  (You can check out the photos from the business profile and tell me what it was!)  I had the trio of seasonal sorbets because you can never go wrong with seasonal sorbets!  Yum yum!\n\nWe had to sit in the front this time since there were no tables available where we could sit side by side.  Service was still good for the most part, but I think it's a bit better when you're inside.  And I should mention the yummy bread rolls they give you in the beginning, oh so good!"

Which is great because you don't get the crazy bachelor/bachlorette party's.\n\nThis is very much a local place. It is reputation is on word of mouth. I always say it is the place you take your secretary to if you don't want your wife to know. lol"

Too much sauce, too much seasoning and it did not seem to make the best of the ingredient itself.  We ordered two different shrimp appetizers and the presentation was exactly the same. We wondered if we ordered two same dishes. \n\nI WAS grateful of the discounted prices on Wednesdays to try out this restaurant.  I want to come back again on Wednesday and try out other dishes on the menu, but my girlfriends are not interested in eating there again....."

I did the Prix-Fixe menu of 2 starters and an entree.  My two starters were sweetbreads and a risotto of tasso ham and crayfish.  The entrees of the table were salmon, veal portershouse, lamb chop and beef tenderloin.  Lastly, the service was the best I've ever experienced at any restaurant."

My boyfriend took my here for my brithday dinner last October and we both agreed it was the best dining experience of our lives! And we eat out all the time. Everything about this place was good. The service is outstanding, they really make you feel special, pulling out your chair placing your napkin in your lap, giving you a sample from the chef, etc. \n\nAnd the food even tops the service. A couple of friends recommended the warm spinach salad, so I took their word for it not even knowing if i liked warm spinach or goat cheese. OMG..best salad ever! The dressing was perfect, goat chesse had a light flaky crust..so delicious.  My main course was proscuitto crusted salmon..absolutely perfect! I got creme brulee for dessert,which was good but I dont feel like the dessert options were outstanding. Who cares though when you just had such a good meal. My boyfriend got the filet mignon for dinner and it was to die for. It came with some potato thingys, I dont even know how to describe them, but they were original and delicious. \n\nProbably will be heading back to Rosemary's for my birthday again next month!"

            "review": "We had dinner at Rosemary's on a Sunday last month.\n\nI arrived early and peppered the hostesses with questions on dishes they would recommend, the art on the walls (from local independent artists and available for purchase), and the age of the restaurant. I also found out they offer full-service catering. The hostesses were friendly (they put up with me) and knowledgeable.\n\nThe place eventually became crowded. It was somewhat hilarious (and a little offensive) how one kid was watching a DVD at the table (who brings their kid - and their personal player - to a place like Rosemary's?). It was all the more obvious since the room was dim (relatively speaking: the tables in the front bar area were better lit). Our dining room suffered from \"mood lighting\" and would benefit from seat or table spotlights; I like to see what I'm eating. Others may argue that they don't want to see their date, so this place may be good for you!\n\nService was outstanding. Our primary server and his assistant explained every dish (even the beer selections). Like Perrier's Le Bec-Fin, the servers were enthusiastic and placed the dishes on the table in unison. Unlike LBF, the servers didn't buzz around the table like insects.\n\nI was running on an hour of sleep, so I (wisely) refrained from having alcohol but a friend had the beer-meal pairings, which he enjoyed.\n\nA few of us ordered the chef's tasting menu ($70). Compared to typical tasting menus, the overall package was a generous size and we weren't able to finish it all. The courses which grabbed my attention (even through my sleepy stupor) were:\n- l'amuse bouche (I was amused)\n- First course: salmon tartar appetizer with watercress, caviar, crackers and a saffron sauce\n- Fourth course: rack of lamb with Kalamata olive mashed potatoes, fried arugula, and a rosemary bordelaise sauce (mmmmmm - quite savory and the lamb was oh-so-tender)\n\nLackluster courses:\n- Second course: Panko crab boulettes with marinated cucumbers (flavorless)\n- Third course: Crispy skin striped bass with hushpuppies and a creole meuniere sauce (not too much flavor, and not a fan of fish)\n- Dessert: I don't remember the dessert - not my thing anyway.\n\nRosemary's is 30-40 minutes from the Strip, but worth the cab ride there. It's popular and is booked quickly, so reserve your table in advance!"

The chef started at Emeril's, and ran the Emeril's at the MGM Grand before starting their own place.  The food is outstanding, and the service is good.  The strip mall and the interior are ordinary.  A nice bonus is that they offer their recipes on a CD, and I've since made many of their dishes.  Try the white chocolate pecan rolls, and the shrimp with blue cheese cole slaw.  You won't be disappointed."

I had the Texas Striped Bass with Grits and some delicious brownies at the end, and my girlfriend had the Fettucini.\n\nWe also got an added bonus with our meal - painful sickness. Both of us were physically sick, her during the meal, and both of us in the days afterwards. While the staffing was very helpful and apologetic at the time, I cannot say that the calls I received in the following days (after I emailed essentially saying this review) were particularly caring nor concerned.\n\nBoth calls were apparently on a 'cover your behind' mission, as they were purely concerned with seeing if I was 'well,' and thanking me for coming to the restaurant. They seemed far more concerned, I'll be honest, with whether I'd recovered rather than my actual wellbeing. It felt as if they were more worried I'd sue, or complain to someone with some actual authority.\n\nSo, no, I'm not particularly happy with a restaurant that had great food that would have been reasonably priced had the restaurant not been so far off the street it was basically in Iowa, that also made me feel so sick that I couldn't do much in my last day in Vegas but sit down and occasionally run to the restrooms in Bally's. \n\nIt's annoying, too, because the service/food really did taste great. What was offensive was being told over the phone that \"the food is quite rich so it can have an effect on people who don't eat a lot of rich food.\" So what you're basically saying is I cook crap at home, really. Sorry, but I'm a good cook, and I cook all kinds of different, rich things. It's condescending and rude to assume someone's generally 'not used' to certain kinds of 'good' foods. \n\nWhatever you guys say, this isn't a place worth the ridiculous cab fares. Nowhere is worth traveling that far for."

First piece of advice, this is not a French restaurant, it is more of a creole inspired Emeril Lagasse restaurant.\nWe were late for out reservations but they were very kind to seat us promptly and we informed them that we had to leave within two hours to make a show. They were very receptive to this. Out waitstaff was amazing and friendly and I cannot say enough good things about them. Unfortunately the food was not so good.\nThe two of us ordered the 3 course menu for $55- which seems like a good deal.\nWe ordered:\n-BBQ shrimp which was delicious although the highlite of the dish was not the shrimp but instead the cole-slaw with blue cheese underneath.\n-Panko crusted scallop special served over grits. The scallops were fresh and tasty but ruined by the soggy panko mush on top and the bitter tasteless grits underneath.\n- Caesar salad. Worst caesar salad I have ever had! The romaine was wilted and soft, the dressing was tasteless. I actually had to eat the anchovies whole to make the salad taste like anything.\n- Lamb chops. Highlite of the meal. These were perfectly cooked and delicious but the mashed potato with olives  underneath were an awful combination. One bite was all I needed to make my decision on those.\n- Sea Bass special. The fish was fresh and tasty but the potatoes and andouille underneath was cold and mushy as if the sous chefs could not get their timing right to plate it. I would have sent it back if I wasn't in a rush to make a show.\n- Flourless chocolate cake. This was delicious but I have never eaten something chocolate that I didn't like.\n\nAll in all I won't go out of my way to eat here again. I will stay on the strip where the prices are higher but so is the competition thus the food is more consistently good."

She got the house salad for her first choice, while I ordered the special, which was some kind of creamy tomato soup.  We ended up switching because we liked each other's more.  The house salad was actually really good and had some crunchy crouton chips that went with it.  My girlfriend really liked the soup.  It was rich and was served with some kind of gourmet potato chips.\n\nFor my second option, I got the barbecue shrimp appetizer.  It was served with a bleu cheese slaw.  The barbecue sauce was really good.  My girlfriend doesn't like shrimp, so this was the perfect amount for me.  However, the dish was too small to share.  The slaw was just ok.  \n\nWe got a sampler before our entree came out.  It was some kind of fish mixture on a wonton.  They were actually pretty good.  \n\nThen the entrees came.  Neither of us were crazy about the entrees.  This is where Rosemary's and so many of these high-priced restaurants mess up is on their entrees.  My girlfriend played it safe and got the parmesan angel hair pasta.  It was good, but is something you could make on your own for much cheaper.  She got some of the fingerling potatoes.  They were ok.  There was a funny flavor to them.  I ordered the rack of lambs.  While they were cooked perfectly, the sauce gave them this awful flavor.  And the potatoes were not edible with the strong flavor of kalamata olives mixed in (probably a preference type of thing).\n\nFor dessert, we got the blueberry and pear cobbler.  My girlfriend didn't like it, because it was mostly fruit and not much cobbler.  And they give you a tiny tiny tiny scoop of vanilla (seriously?!?!?! half the deliciousness of any cobbler is the vanilla ice cream)  But I ate the whole thing anyway.\n\nThey also brought out a little sampler and the peanut butter buckeyes are really good.\n\nOverall, it was pleasent.

The food is great and the 50 dollar prefix dining a definite steal.  One of the things I always tells friends to pay attention to is the detail to service.  I've went several times in a party of 2 and a few times in a party of 6 or more.  Each time, no matter how many people are in your party, the staff attends to your every detail.  When the food is ready to serve it's like a military march out of the kitchen and every plate is set on the table at exactly the same time.  I've yet to have a bad experience here.

The food has not disappointed--it is an interesting blend of cal-french and cajun/bbq.  And, they have a very nice wine list. I would give them five stars but our service last time was less than stellar.  He was very confused about the wine, and kept offering us wines they didn't have and recommending glasses that they didn't have. So much so, that my Dad ended up saying \"forget it\". My mom ordered her salad with the dressing on the side and he attempted to pawn it off on her with the dressing on it. I had to specifically tell him to take it back in order to get him to replace it.  He did so but without apology or acknowledgment of his error. I couldn't tell if he was new or just having a bad day.  These are minor complaints however, given how much we do enjoy the food. \nThe atmosphere is a mix of families (yes the table next to us had two babies), older people and couples. It's somewhat formal and a bit crowded for such a small place.  We ordered really excellent lamb and veal chop and the salad. But it was the appetizers that shone. The shrimp was fine but the chiles rellenos special was flavorful without being hot and the crab cakes were full of crab and flavor, with little bread.  We'll be back, but we do hope that server will be having a better day.\nOn our first visit we even got a call a few days after our visit to follow up on our experience. That first visit was perfect and I had nothing but good things to say. On the second visit, we didn't get any follow up call or I would have mentioned the waiter.\nReservations seem to be vital. There is a bar waiting area though and their cocktails looked good. A couple was also eating at the bar, so maybe the bar takes walk ins."

            "review": "My boyfriend and I took the 204 bus there, taking under 30 minutes in the early evening of a Sunday. This destination was where we planned our one splurge meal for our four-day stay in Sin City. We didn't have a reservation since we weren't sure when we'd decide to head over (about 7 miles west of Sahara), but there wasn't a problem getting our table for two at 5:45 PM. (It did get pretty bumpin' around 6:30 PM, though.)\n\nThere are three styles of dining at Rosemary's:\n1) A la carte, which is what we are used to doing at fancy restaurants.\n2) Prix fixe, which was the most flexible option for a set price of $55: any entree and two other courses from the menu (except for the foie gras, which you'd just add $15 to get, and the appetizer sampler, which can only be ordered a la carte).\n3) Tasting menu, ranging from $80 to $125 for five courses and whether you want wine or beer pairings (or neither) with each course.\n\nWe went with the prix fixe option, and I don't regret our choice:\n\n1 amuse bouche: vegetable bread pudding\n-- I'm a huge fan of bread pudding, so this savory take was a fresh look at a familiar texture. Add some sharp bits of caramelized onions on top, and the picture is complete.\n\n2 fresh rolls: potato and white chocolate pecan\n-- Fresh bread is irresistible in my book, and both of these were delectable. The white chocolate pecan sticks out in my memory since it was little dessert preview before our meal formally started. Yum!\n\n3 appetizers: Hugo's Texas BBQ shrimp, pan-fried milk-fed veal sweetbreads, and twice-baked Parmesan souffle\n-- My favorite out of the three was the twice-baked Parmesan souffle. Normally, you'd think of souffles as a sweet, takes at least 30 minutes after ordering to bake and arrive at your table sort of dish. But Rosemary's disrupts both of these norms. The garlic cream sauce and wild mushrooms couldn't have complemented the fluffy, savory souffle any better. (It also helps that I am a fan of both garlic and mushrooms.)\n-- The shrimp was quite good, but I was drawn more towards the coleslaw (actually a cheeseslaw). It strayed away from the normal sour taste of coleslaw and made me enjoy blue cheese, which I usually don't.\n-- The sweetbreads were fun to eat just because we don't get to very often.\n\n2 entrees: roasted rack of lamb and Creole-grilled prime ribeye\n-- Jon A. ordered the lamb rare, and, boy, did they deliver. They cooked the entire rack first and then sliced it, so each piece was quite obviously pink. I'm not sure how I felt about there being Kalamata olives in the mashed potatoes, but overall, this dish was satisfying.\n-- The ribeye was huge, especially after everything we'd already devoured thus far. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium-rare, and I couldn't get enough of the creamy grits. My absolute favorite flavor of the evening came from the fried onions on top of the steak: Rosemary's used red onions rather than the traditional white, and the batter coating the onions was seasoned with a beautiful combination of herbs and spices. Why can't all fried onions be made this way?\n\n1 dessert: goat cheese cheesecake\n-- A modest helping of dessert after a marathon of a meal, the goat cheese cheesecake didn't hide its origins (i.e., you can definitely taste the goat cheese if you are paying attention). A generous dollop of freshly whipped cream sat on top, and underneath was a decorative spread of Scotch caramel sauce. An excellent finale to the meal.\n\n3 mignardise:\n-- Just when we thought it was over, our waiter presented us with bonus desserts: peanut butter buckeyes, lemon squares, and brownie bites. My favorite of the three were the peanut butter buckeyes: they were coated in something extremely crispy, which balanced out the soft peanut butter texture.\n\n----\n\nSunday nights is when Rosemary's offers up many of their bottles of wine (including half bottles) at 50% off. We asked our waiter for a recommendation to go with what we ordered (above), and we ended up trying a $74 bottle for $37. A super Tuscan, the Terre del Marchesato \"Emilio Primo\" (vintage 2005) went pretty well with every course. Unlike other reds I've had, it didn't overpower the taste of the food but did a great job clearing the palate between each bite.\n\nThe service was unbeatable: they paid attention to every detail, down to pulling your chairs out at the same time when you are initially seated.\n\nThe verdict: Wow, what a wonderful surprise this off-strip restaurant was! Food + service + ambiance were all stellar. I wish there were something like it closer to home. It was definitely worth the trek off the Strip.\n\nExtra hints:\n* Book a reservation on OpenTable if you like to accumulate points: http://www.opentable.com/rest_profile.aspx?rid=6553\n* Plan ahead and buy two $50 gift cards for $80 if you want to save $10 per meal: http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.aspx?Prodid=11126571&whse=BC&topnav=&bro\n* Check their current promos: http://www.rosemarysrestaurant.com/promotions.htm"

We were both starving, so we didn't want to wait so they seated us at this table in the corner of the outside room. We later understand why they did that. Apparently this is a \"fine-dining\" meaning, everyone supposed to dress all semi-formal-ish. Yelp didn't tell us that, so we showed up in shorts and flip-flops. OOPS. But it's okay, we had the table with the comfy chairs :)\n\nOur waitress is super nice and was willing to assist us with our menu due to the fact that this was our first time. She recommended us to the prix-fixe meal. The prix-fixe meal is $55 3-course meal of your choice. When most entrees on the menu are over  $30, by going with the prix-fixe, you're getting more food for a much better price.\n\nNow, lets talk about their service. I've never been to a place with such excellent service as Rosemary's. Everyone is so polite and attentive to your needs. I'd have to give a 5 stars for their service!"

Used multiple Costco giftcards (costco.com if you're from out of state), so the value of the dinner was even better :) \n\nAppetizers:\n*Yellowfin Tuna Carpaccio (5 stars): light, fresh, simply delicious.  This was everyone's favorite.  \n*Twice Baked Parmesan Souffl\u00e9 (3.5 stars): first few bites are good, then it becomes too cheesy.  Fluffy and light, yet full of flavor...it sits in a cheese sauce too...I love cheese & even I thought it became too much after a few bites.  But then again, I have a habit of liking to clean my plate & not wasting food.\n*Cornmeal Fried Oysters (4 stars):  Good, but not that special; tastes exactly how it sounds.  I wouldn't order this unless you LOVE fried oysters so much that you'd be willing to miss out trying better appetizers offered. This dish is yummy tho, so I don't want to downplay it.\n*Foie gras (3 stars): We paid extra to try this (not part of prefixed menu).  It was seared foie gras on a soggy bread/pancake thing; I was disappointed by it.  I've had much better foie gras.. I like my foie gras more seared..& this one just didn't have too much flavor..I also did not like the soggy bread/pancake thing it sat on at all.\n\nMain Course:\n*Special of day: braised lamb (5 stars): WOW....the meat is so tender, it doesn't require a knife to cut..the meat falls off the bone.  No game taste at all...one of the best lamb i've ever had.  Marinated to perfection.\n*Roasted Rack of Lamb (5 stars):  Another WOW.  Similar to above, no game taste, tender meat, and just plain amazing.  Between the 2 lambs, I can't even choose which one is better b/c they're both equally amazing.  \n*Moroccan Spiced Sea Scallops (4 stars): Well prepared.  Soft, no-ocean taste, fresh.  Sits in a light curry sauce.  \n\nDessert:\n*Cr\u00e8me Brulee (5 stars): DELICIOUS.  Creamy, soft inside with light, crunchy caramelized sugar on top.  I've had plenty of good creme brulee before, but this one just stands out...loved this dessert...not even a scrap leftover.\n*Panna Cotta w/ strawberries (5 stars):  As delicious as the creme brulee above (these 2 were the table favorites).  The strawberries were nice & sweet and the panna cotta was done just right..not too sweet and had a nice soft, creamy texture.  I would order this one over the creme brulee only b/c it's harder to find good panna cotta than it is to find good creme brulee.\n*Seasonal Ice Creams or Sorbets (4 stars):  cookies w/ 3 scoops of different flavors of icecream or sorbet gave nice variety.  Nice palette cleanser, but the 2 above desserts are much better choices.\n\nPetit-fours: Lemon cake, peanut butter w/ rice crispy ball, and chocolate fudge.  Best piece was the peanut butter ball...i liked the crunch of the rice krispies in it.  The other 2 were only ok..."

My fianc\u00e9 and I are foodies and love to explore new and exciting restaurants.  We were recently on vacation in Vegas and were desperately avoiding Las Vegas Blvd restaurants.  I had made reservations for Bouchon on Friday and was eagerly anticipating a fabulous meal courtesy of Anthony Bourdain's recommendation.  I had seen something about Rosemary's and got a later reservation for us on Thursday.  WHAT A WONDERFUL MEAL!   The Pre Fixe menu was a steal and the flavors that were reached by the chef could have demanded twice the price.  We would have paid that and more. For appetizers we had crawfish risotto and the parmesan souffl\u00e9.  As a main course I had the rack of lamb and my fianc\u00e9 had the veal porterhouse.  Finally for desert I had pecan pie and homemade ice cream and he had bananas foster cheese cake.  I could not have asked for a better meal.  This is for sure top 5 meal of my life.  Fianc\u00e9 says top meal for him.  Our server was Tony and all our needs were met spectacularly and as I am not a wine drinker he never made me feel less of a diner for not ordering anything other than water and coffee.  PLEASE make sure you go to the restaurant.  Don't wait, make sure to make reservations."

It took a lot of convincing to get our party of 15 to agree to travel outside the strip for dinner, but it was soooo worth it. \n\nEverything just worked out perfectly. I called that afternoon several times and finally got ahold of someone. I was so excited when they agreed to accommodate our large party at 8PM. They asked if we were celebrating any birthdays and when I told them yes, they did something special for that person for dessert.\n\nThe pre-fixe menu is a great deal, but you can also order ala carte. The portions are generous, so no one left the place hungry. I had the warm spinach goat cheese salad. Yum! The crawfish risotto was apparently very good too. I ordered the angel hair pasta for dinner... I am sure there are better things on the menu, but I'm not much of a meat eater. The apple tart was very good too...though I was really very stuffed and should have stopped eating after the salad! The only odd part about the meal was the mountain of butter that they served with the rolls...seriously, I have never seen so much butter... yum!\n\nThe service was top notch. The waiters take their jobs seriously and it showed. Everytime I went to the ladies room, there was someone there to greet me and pull out my chair for me when I got back to our table. I was never without wine in my glass and the dining experience was similar to what you would get at a 5 star restaurant. Believe me, you'll get over the fact that it's in a strip mall real fast.\n\nOur table was nice and roomy...we didn't feel crammed, rushed, or unwelcomed -as large parties in Vegas might sometimes feel.\n\nThey served us all a delicious amuse bouche at the beginning of the meal and every dish was served all at once... no one waiting around for their dish to show up. Everything was nice and hot cooked perfectly.\n\nThe cost was about $75 per person...considering we ordered 5 bottles of wine at $60 a pop...that is really inexpensive and well worth the cab ride to the restaurant.\n\nTo top it off, the restaurant called me to day to find out how I enjoyed my dining experience.... how nice is that???\n\nI would definitely come back here whenever I return to Vegas...which could be awhile given my lack of luck in the casinos."

Sahara, #110\nCorkage: $15\nCost: $140 - Seven Course Tasting Menu (inclusive of tax, tip & corkage)\nPhone: 702.869.2251\n\nI've not heard of this restaurant before, not until I flipped through the WS Restaurant Guide and spotted this Award of Excellence recipient. Decided to check out the website, happy to see that they regularly offers a three course prix-fixe and also 1/2 price wine on Sunday evenings, both good signs to the restaurant's food quality and wine friendliness.\n\nAfter contacting Jennifer Hollifield, their Sales & Catering Director, a seven course tasting menu was setup for 13 happy winos. The menu itself was $95 and we were able to come to an all inclusive price of just under $140 per person, can't ask for any better in Vegas. \n\nThe restaurant setup a separate table for all our wines, Nick Hetzel, Sommelier/Restaurant Manager took great care on all aspects of the service for the entire evening, especially considering our party size and the amount of stems and decanters we went through.\nAll 13 plates for each course always arrived at the same time for all guests.\nWe were brought fresh stems matched to varietal for every single wine we brought in, which I found out from Nick we went through 252 stems to be exact. Decanting were promptly suggested if necessary without any of us asking.\n\nThe only surprise of the evening was the amount of food per course, lesson learned here but this in no way shape or form a negative thing. \nFiguring all tasting menu are build the same, at least portion wise, I asked for a seven course menu. When the price came back to be $95 for the menu, I didn't even think about it twice that the portion size would be out of ordinary, boy, am I dead wrong on this.\nI think by the time we finished the amuse and the first two course, I started to get yelled and questioned at, \"how hungry were you when you planned this menu?\"  \nThe amount of food on each plate was at least two times as much as I expected for a seven course menu, the rack of lamb at the end was about three times as much. The really amazing thing here was Anwar was able to finish two servings of the rack of lamb after cleaning every single plate that was put in front of him for the night.  \n\nWe finally cleared out of the place close to 1:00am, a huge thank you to the staff of the restaurant with Nick and Jennifer in particular to make this wonderful evening possible and went off without a hitch.\nRosemary's will be my go to restaurant for any future wine dinners in Vegas, just have to remember to down size the menu so we won't require stretchers to get us out of the restaurant.  \n\nFor those of you that's not been to Rosemary's before, please do so on your next visit to Vegas. It's a bit out of the way, but definitely worth the taxi ride or drive to seek the restaurant out. On top of that, the time you spend at this restaurant will definitely save you money on the blackjack table.  \n\nTasting Menu\n\nAmuse\nFried Potato Qunelle with Ostera Caviar & Traditional Garnishes\n\nCreole Poached Lobster\nWith Tomato Concasse, Watercress Tossed in Toasted Pecan Vinaigrette, Grilled Green Onion & New Orleans Style Remoulade Sauce\n\nSeared Hudson Valley Foie Gras\nToasted Brioche, Duck Confit, Garlic Spinach, Dried Cherry Port Wine Reduction Sauce\n\nCrispy Striped Bass\nOn a Fingerling Potato Andouille Hash with Southern Style Hushpuppies & Creole Meuniere Sauce\n\nGrilled Loin of Pork Chop\nHoppin' John & a Stone Ground Mustard Reduction\n\nRosemary's Roasted Rack of Lamb\nOn a Toasted Pine Nut Couscous with Fried Arugula Leaves & Balsamic Meat Juices\n\nCheese Plate\nGrafton, Maytag Blue & Camembert with Walnut Bread, Toasted Nuts, Dried Cherries, Port Wine Syrup & Onion Marmalade\n\nDessert Storm\n\n\nWine List\n1985 Krug Brut Champagne\n2000 Etienne Sauzet Puligny-Montrachet Les Combottes 1er Cru\n2001 Kistler Chardonnay Russian River Valley Vine Hill Vineyard (CORKED)\n1975 Rieussec Sauternes\n1990 Rieussec Sauternes\n1997 Zind-Humbrecht Gewrztraminer Alsace Grand Cru Gueberschwihr Goldert\n2002 M.

However, I made a big mistake by not inquiring how far away this place is from the Strip -- from Mandalay, it's about a $25 cab ride (that's each way).  Be warned!  The cabbie who drove us back told us that the drivers LOVE taking people there from the Strip.  Heh.\n\nThe food IS really good, though.  They have a $45 prix fixe deal for 3 courses, which is good if you think you can eat that much.  The appetizers, salads, and entrees are sized pretty well, so keep that in mind.  The husband really enjoyed the Asian slaw that accompanied his seared tuna (he's an addict, what can I say?), and my scallops were tasty and not overcooked, although slightly overseasoned.  We went on a Sunday night, which conveniently happened to be their 1/2 price bottles of wine night.  HUGE plus for that!  And they have a cab company who sends drivers very quickly at the end of your meal, so at least you don't have to wait long for the ride back."

It was well worth the $55 cab trip from the strip to dine here and it was so much better than even the most exclusive and pricey of Vegas Strip hotel restaurants!  \n\nWe sat at the kitchen bar and conversed with the cooks and the chef while watching all the activity. Rosemary's is unusual - they pair excellent beers with their courses (of course they also pair wine for the less adventurous). We enjoyed some Belgian beer with our meal and had an interesting conversation with both the chef and the manager about their various beer choices. \n\nThere was an exciting and unusual set of selections. From the Maytag Blue Cheese Carpaccio and the Tasso Ham and Crawfish Risotto appetizers, to the Salmon entree and the coconut bread pudding, we found every bite to be a delight and a wonder. I almost wish I could live in Vegas so I could go to Rosemary's regularly and try everything they make. \n\nTry it. You will LOVE it. We did! Best in Vegas!"

There are always new places to try and for me that is pretty exciting. I read all the rave reviews about Rosemary's on 10 Best, Trip Advisor, govegas.com, yelp, and the list goes on. Based on the fairly consistent reviews I was determined to add Rosemary's to my dining list while visiting over the 4th of July weekend. \n\nThe bf and I had reservations, but the snooty hostess still made us take a seat and wait it out. Our server was extremely friendly and helpful with menu selections. However, she seemed to forget about us after our order was taken. \n\nThe Service - Extremely slow. And our food took forever to come out. \n\nThe Food - I ordered the Barbecue Texas Shrimp which was good but did not live up to all the rave reviews. The barbecue sauce seemed to be lacking something and the coleslaw was heavy on the blue cheese - it over powered the dish. My bf ordered the chicken dish which seemed to have a light pan-fried crust just over the top - delicious! \n\nThe disappointment came when after waiting an excessive period of time for my $42 rack of lamb it came out rare when I specifically requested medium well. Off to the kitchen it went for another 25 minutes. In the meantime, there was no offer to compensate for their mistake. \n\nShame on you Rosemary's. This is definitely not good customer service. The manager did not even come to our table to apologize. Guess they were too busy hob nobing with the other surrounding tables. \n\nWhen the same rack of lamb finally came out 25 minutes later it was totally overcooked and dry. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the seasonal berry cobbler. I love sweets but this was a disappointment. It could have been a bit less tart. I really wanted to give this establishment 5 stars, but the slow service, overcooked lamb, tart dessert and snooty hostess left a bad taste in my mouth. The manager could also attempt to be more accommodating and concerned about the level of service. \n\nI really wanted to give Rosemary's five stars.  However, this was just not a very good first experience.  Not sure I would return."

The only (somewhat lame) reason I don't give this a 5 star rating is due to the somewhat uncool location and (very nice but) unforgettable atmosphere.\n\nWhat is not forgettable, however, is the quality service and tremendous food.  Dining here more than a couple of times, I have always noticed the chef/owners are highly involved with quality control in all aspects.  While you would expect this based on the menu prices, they deliver just right on that expectation.\n\nThe chef's tasting menus have never let us down, and the wine selection is one of the best in the city.\n\nFor the tourists in Vegas, it might be a $15 - $20 taxi ride (each way) in which I might not suggest it's worth that much trouble.  But if you have your own ride, it is absolutely worth the trip as it compete with any other \"high end\" restaurant in any of the Las Vegas Strip hotels."

So my friends and I headed over to Rosemary's...rumored to be one of the best restaurants in Vegas.\n\nOur entire table ordered the five course meal which was an easy way out; I mean, we were staring at that menu for a looooong time because everything sounded so good. Believe it or not, it was actually a good value (strange term to be used in an upscale restaurant) and featured the chef's favorite items. And as someone had mentioned elsewhere, you can choose a wine or beer pairing if you like. None of us did or we wouldn't have made it out the door to our next destination. \n\nStrangely enough, as great as the food was, that's not what impressed me the most. The service was really....different. Usually I go to these expensive restaurants, and expect it to be kinda stuffy; I feel a bit like a kid, struggling to sit properly. But Rosemary's isn't like that. The service is stellar. They cater to your every whim just like they do at any other upscale restaurant, but the dining room isn't darkened with hushed voices from other patrons. It's lively and bright, just like the servers. \n\nOur adorable server was full of anecdotes and little stories about the dishes and of his own interesting past in the restaurant business. His Italian accent and his gestures were so cute and jovial, I just wanted to squish him in a box and take him home. (Okay, that sounded weird, but you get my point.)"

The food was unimpressive, the service wasn't as good as it should have been and the atmosphere was a mockery of a fine dining establishment.  \n\nFood:  \n\nThe food was OK.  Of the eight or so things I tried I thought two were above average.  The bread they served was slathered with butter and that's always a good thing.  It was delicious, warm and a great way to start the meal.  The one thing I'd describe as memorable was the Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw.  I'd order a plate of this and go home.\n\nI tried two soups and wasn't blown away by either.  My appetizers were a beef carpachio, which was fine and sweetbreads which were chewy.  \n\nMy main course was scallops, which were horribly overcooked.  My friends ordered fish which was also overcooked.  None of my friends raved about their food except for one (you'll see why under the service section).\n\nThe food aimed to be \"high end\" but there was nothing innovative or interesting about this food. \n\nThe drink selection was good, specifically beer.  The drinks were expensive but they had a top notch beer selection.\n\nAtmosphere:  \n\nRosemary's is located in a strip-mall.  Even better, the light over the front door was flickering like one outside a cheap motel.  The artwork on the wall wasn't especially interesting or noteworthy.  There were some framed mirrors by the bar which felt like something out of Crate and Barrel.\n\nMy friends who recommended the place made it sound like it was about to receive a Michelin star but nothing could be farther from the truth.  In a city like Las Vegas, which is full of world-class restaurants, Rosemary's felt like the place in a small town were folks go for their anniversary.\n\nThere's a reason this place is three miles from where all the tourists are.\n\nService:\n\nThe service here aimed to be good but failed at the one thing that supposedly makes them unique.  When we were seated we were asked if there were any food allergies or requests.  This on one hand was very nice because we had several people with food differences.  On the other hand why not just wait until people order to ask such a sweeping question?  Also most people with food differences don't wait until they're asked to share so it seems like a nice question but it's actually quite dumb.\n\nMost servers, when presented with a table full of people with food challenges, would be sure to note any foods that were ordered which have \"hidden meats\" like chicken stock or pork.  Two people, who do not eat ham, were served food with two kinds of bacon.  The server didn't think, \"Hey these people don't eat red meat... maybe that extends to bacon!\"  Since she had pretended to care so deeply my friends ended up eating things they didn't want to.\n\nThis place makes a big show out of being \"fancy\" and their servers are instructed on how to act.  They put on a good show but nothing could hide the fact that our server wasn't comfortable talking to the customers and established no report with our jovial table.  \n\nValue:\n\nRosemary's used quality ingredients in their food but cooked them poorly, did nothing interesting with the food rendering it a waste.  For the $55 I spent on dinner I could have gone to a much higher quality place and had slightly less food.  I don't need to be stuffed with badly cooked scallops and bread to feel I got my money's worth."

My dinner companion used the bread to soak every bit of it.\n\nBoth of us had salmon.  Excellent quality and cooked perfectly.\n\nAgain, both of us had apple tart and cinnamon ice cream.

For me, there would be no moment closer to Nirvana than for him to say, \"Hi, Stacey.  What can I fix you to eat?\"  \n\nThe dining experience at Rosemary's can only be described as sublime.  I do not have the priviledge of eating at high-end restaurants on a regular basis.  However, I do get to Las Vegas quite often, and I would gladly save my restaurant dollars to visit Rosemary's as often as possible.\n\nRosemary's has achieved the rare accomplishment of serving unbelievably delicious food and delivering superb service in a upscale, but completely unpretentious atmosphere.  Eating at this restaurant feels as if your best friend happens to be one of the most talented gourmet chefs in town, and he has invited you over for dinner (or lunch).\n\nWhen I made reservations here for our 20th anniversary, my husband and I  were fawned over like rock stars.  Today we went over there for lunch, and for a price that was half of what we spent at Terra Rossa the night before (see my two-star review), we had one of the finest meals we've experienced in LV.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I tell you that if you are wavering about whether to rent a car on your next trip to Vegas, do it, if only to make  it easier for you to get to Rosemary's.  Plus, you will get to go home and tell your friends that the best restaurant in Las Vegas is in a strip mall way west of The Strip beween a SteinMart and a dollar store."

They were also useful in assisting us in determining which dishes may best suit our tastes. They didn't react negatively at all when my mother chose to just sample our prix fixe three course dinner, since she wasn't so hungry.\n\nI'll try to remember everything we had\n\n(1) Dogs wouldn't touch it --- (10) Gods/goddesses dine on this\n\nPan fried Sweet breads - (6) Was a little bland for my taste\nGoat cheese stuffed Proscuitto FIgs - (10) THE HIGHLIGHT of the dinner, the combination was genius in my mind, and I can't wait to make this dish on my own.\nSalmon Tartar - (8) Fresh salmon, tasted great\nGrilled Veal tenderloin - (7) Cooked nicely, but it was cold when it came out\nCrispy Bass - (8) Well seasoned, the hushpuppies and shrimp were awesome compliments.\nFlat Iron Steak (7) - Nothing stood out to me, it was a well made steak, but nothing unique, even with the sauce.\nFlourless Chocolate cake - (5) This is for extreme chocolate lovers only, it's like biting into a brick of bitter chocolate, dipped in ultra dark chocolate, covered in cocoa powder. I love bittersweet Lindt chocolate bars, but this was way powerful.\nCarrot cake - (6) Unfortunately, the cake was dry, but the flavor was passable.\nIce Box lemon tart - (5) I am very selective on lemon based desserts, and this didn't float my particular boat.\n\nRosemary has its hits and misses, but I could see why they have repeat customers. According to the waiter, Carrot-top visits this place often. The staff is polite, the d\u00e9cor is nice, and the food is creative and fun.  It was a pleasant surprise to find that Mondays were industry nights, which gave a discount for those who service the restaurant industry (my mother). For me, the desserts here disappoint, but there is much variety to savor in their main dishes. I will be back another time to try out other entrees I missed. Proscuitto wrapped Figs with Goat Cheese are genius, I realize I stated that before, but I would drive back here just to have a plate of that appetizer alone."

The 1st dish was the \"famous\" Texas BBQ Shrimp, the 'signature dish\". Just a salad with some shrimps you can't even taste because of this salty, sugared and unpleasant sauce. The crab boulettes were on the same tone, nothing special.\nThe real problem is that shrimps and crab weren't really good fresh products (frozen?), not what you expect from a grand restaurant! Same thing for the fish and the beef (perhaps one of the worse steak we had in US and it's $39 \u00e0 la carte).\nMaybe the desserts were the more eatable food in Rosemary but nothing to remember. In fact, we've already forgotten. Best thing was the californian Viogner Sauvignon blanc. Maybe because they don't make it...\n\nIt's a pity that I can't put zero star for Rosemary's...

A peek at the menu and I realized this would be a splurge but not so much that I would break the bank. \n\nI took my parents, who still live in LV, and it was unanimous -- hidden behind a draped doorway, in just another innocuous strip mall, beats a culinary heart and a giving soul. Having long given up on the search for a good restaurant nearby, Mom and Dad were surprised to find a local restaurant so close to home. And, so good! \n\nFrom the bufala appetizer to the delicious desert cookies -- we were in heaven. The wine list offered selections that paired well with the food but didn't inspire me to explore something new -- although that's not a deal breaker -- this may be disappointing to a true vinophile. And, if it is, Rosemary's is worthy of your coveted bottle beginning with the word 'Chateau'. Bring it with you to celebrate the season of love or just to celebrate discovering an excellent new restaurant without the continuous soundtrack of mega bucks in the background.\n\nI held back from 5 stars due to the slow service. Slow and steady is fine especially when savoring flavors -- but it bordered on inattentive at times. I have a feeling Rosemary's will continue to improve their service and impress with their food  -- so I'm looking forward to returning and adding to this star."

GREAT!\n\nAs previously stated, it's located in a strip mall which makes you think that the restaurant that everyone speaks so highly of may not be what you are expecting. *buzzer* WRONG! You walk into Rosemary's and the idea you had of entering a nail salon is quickly diminished. You walk in and are immediately taken to a beautiful restaurant that looks as if it is in a high-end casino and hotel. The wait staff is eager to serve you and is ready to make sure that your entire experience is a positive one.\n\nOur server, Theresa, was awesome. She went over the menu with us and explained that we could choose most anything and make it a 3-course Prix Fixe meal. \n\nWhile looking at the menu, hubby and I choose some appetizers. I opted for the Twice Baked Parmesan Souffle which is a regular souffle which has replaced sugar with Parmesan cheese.  Hubby chose their BBQ Shrimp. Both were mouthwatering and fantastic. You wanted to just order more of it and make it a meal. This was only after the chef gifted you with his special creation of the night. I can't remember what we were given but, just like the appetizers, you wanted more.\n\nAs my main course, I chose the filet of beef. Hubby opted for the veal. While both were amazing, the filet just blew us both out of the water. When we go back, and we WILL be going back, we have both decided to have the filet. It came with asparagus and some extremely tasty potato fritters. I could not finish my meal but I could have continued eating until I made myself sick and it would have been worth every moan. My food was so good that I took it with me in hopes of getting hungry later so I could finish it. Alas, it never happened, but the thought of it was enticing.\n\nUpon completion of our meal, Theresa asked how everything was and I couldn't even vocalize just how good everything was. She quipped, \"We have to try extra hard to please. I mean, we are next to a dollar store.\" Which is so true. It took about 15-20 minutes to get to Rosemary's since it is off the strip. To stress just how good it is, I would be willing to look at local bus schedules to get my butt there if I was without my car and the taxi drive would prove to break the bank.\n\nSo if the other reviews haven't convinced you to get out to Rosemary's the next time you're in Vegas, I hope mine has. It really is not to be missed."

I was surprised at how delicate and perfectly breaded the sweetbreads were. They were accompanied with a bed of french lentils and the pairing was perfect! The crawfish was accompanied with a wonderfully savory ham and this combo was also delightful. Melt in your mouth delight with a little kick to wake you up! The rack of lamb was cooked just as I asked and just the right amount of racks (3) to make a meal complete.\n\nForgot to add the amuse bouche at the start of the meal was a great start! Also, even though we didn't order a dessert, we did receive a mini  trio of desserts. All of which I can only remember the peanut butter chocolate truffle like candy. yummm\n\nOverall: If you're in town and wanting more than what the Strip has to offer, definitely check out Rosemary's!!!"

The steak meat quality was excellent, but the BBQ + A1 sauce was not a compliment to the steak at all, the sauce made the steak unbearable and tasted cheap, the sauce itself brought the overall quality way down, not to mention the chef did not cut off all the very fatty unedible part of the meat. \n\nThe desert was not very impressive, neither... \n\nThe overall decor of the restaurant is cozy and comfortable with like typical American higher-end restaurant (this is suppose to be a French restaurant?), however few of my friends are skinnier and thought the chair were uncomfortable to sit on, so I don't think it's so acceptable.  \n\nThe service was great!

We heard it was the best this and that and the other thing, it was in some strip mall of Sarah 15 mins from the strip, blah blah blah... We had Sunday off so we caught a movie and decided to bop over to Rosemary's. I had a beanie and a white T-Shirt on and I felt pretty confident walking into what I thought was some mom and pop restaurant next to the DOLLAR TREE in a STRIP CENTER. \n\nWe opened the doors to one of the nicest restaurants I have ever set foot in. I immediately felt ashamed in my dingy Sunday-worst clothing, but strangely not uncomfortable. \n\nFrom the onset my boss and I were treated with the utmost respect and care. We were seated immediately on a Sunday night (half off wine night!!) around 9pm. This restaurant is highly professional and our waiter was the poster boy for professional service. \n\nWe were brought rolls followed by some foie gras. The wine started flowing and our apps arrived. My boss got Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp, and it was incredible. 5 Shrimp... this thing was an entree! I got a Crawdad Risotto, and not only was it an entree itself  it was so incredibly rich and flavorful that I could have ordered it again and called it a night. \n\nThe special of the house that night was the short ribs and my boss got that... I am not a fan of short ribs, but apparently they were wonderful. I got the Creole Grilled Center Cut New York Strip. I usually never order steak at a restaurant, but this was just perfect and cooked medium just to my liking. I couldn't even eat half of it though because of the giant apps, but it was excellent.  \n\nFortunately, or unfortunately depending on how you look at it, we got the Prix-Fixe style meal so we HAD to get dessert. This is where Rosemary's sealed the deal for me. Three words: Goat Cheese Cheesecake. I can never eat mere COW Cheesecake again. I would consider driving back to Vegas just to eat this dessert again. My boss got some Chocolate Bread Pudding or something... GOAT CHEESE CHEESECAKE PEOPLE!  \n\nOverall this place is one of the best ever. Perfect mix of high class and casual candor, impeccable service, and extraordinary food. Take a cab, hitch a ride, or run to Rosemary's from the Strip, and you will NOT be disappointed."

Although they are typically closed on Sundays for lunch, they agreed to open their whole restaurant for our small party and to give us a private room.  \n\nThey then proceeded to customize the menu according to the favorites we had heard about on Yelp and were always quick to reply, respond, and help.  \n\nThe day of the lunch, their staff was professional, friendly, and flexible.  Food came out promptly and was hot and delicious.  I personally thought the meal was quite good and was happy with all I ordered.\n\nHugo's Texas Shrimp - this is definitely only for blue cheese fans, but the shrimp came out moist and delectable with the tasty BBQ sauce and was served on a wonderful bed of slaw flavored with blue cheese.  The blue cheese and BBQ sauce worked very well together and I see why this is a fan favorite.\n\nRack of Lamb - Normally a dinner item, Rosemary's was happy to include it on our lunch menu for no additional charge.  Two large pieces of lamb came out that were cooked medium rare.  The sauce was a slightly sweet combination that went went with the meat.  A solid entree.  I loved the diced olived and mash potatoes that accompanied the lamb.\n\nApple Tart - a warm apple tart was served with a cookie and caramel ice cream.  I found the tart to be lacking apple, but liked the cookie and ice cream.\n\nDespite it's strip mall location and off-the-strip location (about 10 miles), Rosemary's is definitely worth the visit.  The value here is fantastic, including prix fixe lunch menus and $55 prix fixe dinner menus and you'll definitely get more than you could at a mediocre hotel restaurant.  \n\nWe look forward to returning the next time we are in Las Vegas and thank Rosemary's for their great service and hospitality.\n\nRosemary's accepts credit cards, including American Express."

Husband and wife chefs Michael and Wendy Jordan oversee a neighborhood restaurant that just happens to serve excellent food.  Just a few years ago, Rosemary's would sometimes be called the best restaurant in Las Vegas.  That's no longer the case, but only because the city has seen an explosion of top notch restaurants.  By all accounts, Rosemary's is as good as ever.\n\nThe biggest problem for a visitor is that the restaurant is located way off the Strip - a 30 minute drive.  However, prices are so much lower than at comparable strip restaurants that you can still come out ahead.\n\nI've only eaten there once, but can vouch for everything I tried:  Hugo's Texas BBQ shrimp and Maytag blue cheese cole slaw (sounds weird, tastes great); pan seared Hawaiian mahi mahi; goat cheese cheesecake.  The food is served in large portions and is very rich."

We were staying at Red Rock so it was just a few miles away. \n\nWhen I walked in I thought the place looked a little suburban. I was not expecting much. Boy was I wrong!! Everything about that meal -from the food to the service to the call afterward to see if we enjoyed our meal - was amazing. \n\nWe all went with the three course prix fixe menu. Since I am not a big dessert person you can order two apps and a main meal. I got the steak tartare for my first app. It was just perfect. I've had a lot of steak tartare through the years and as simple as the dish is, it is very easy to screw up. Not this time. Just perfectly seasoned and presented beautifully. It was one of the best steak tartares I have ever had. \n\nSpeaking of presentation, I really enjoyed the coordinated serving of each dish. We were a group of 6 and every course was served simultaneously. I always think that is a nice touch. \n\nI then got the scallops with prosciutto and they also were great. Perfectly cooked and served over a delicious cous cous. I tried the cauliflower soup and risotto that my friends were having and both were excellent. \n\nI ordered the veal as the main dish at the waiter's recommendation. Again, it was flawless. The meat was cooked at the perfect temperature and served with the delicious lentils. I was so full from the other two dishes (the portions are very large) that I could not finish, though it did make for an excellent breakfast. \n\nThe rest of our group also loved their food. We were all stuffed at the end. \n\nThe service was wonderful. Roberto took very good care of us and was attentive without being too intruding or aloof. \n\nAs we were driving back to LA after a fun filled weekend, Rosemary's called us to see if the meal was to our liking. I really enjoy when a restaurant goes that extra mile. There is no doubt I will be back and make the trip out to Rosemary's again. Thanks for a great meal."

            "review": "Based on Web research I visited Rosemary's this past week when in Vegas for a birthday rest and relaxation trip.  It is indeed in an unlikely location but the decor is upscale and pleasing to the eye yet very soothing.\n\nTheir three course fixed price lunch is a bargain at $28.00 but I had a Web promo printed out that brought the price down to $23.  Absolutely an outstanding bargain at either price.  \n\nOrdered a salad with arugula, poached pears, nuts and blue cheese - outstanding. Entree was duck confit with lentils.  It was not rendered for long enough and thus was a bit fattier than it should have been and wasn't quite at the optimal pull-apart stringy texture that marks a great confit but still very tasty.  Dessert was a flourless chocolate torte - very good but IMHO served a bit too cold.\n\nService was from an attentive young staff - obviously well trained and eager (almost to eager) to please.  I likea  slightly more subdued presence that is nearly invisible but from an overall standpoint I still have to give them high marks for service.\n\nI'm very picky about food and have eaten in some very good restaurants on my travels.  I can safely recommend Rosemary's to anyone who is serious about food and service and has high expectations.    They are obviously very committed to a high level of service and focused on both the quality of food and the presentation.  It's worth the effort required to get there if you're in Vegas."

            "review": "You'd be hard pressed to find a better off the strip restaurant than Rosemary's. Despite its strip mall location, it's one of the best spots in the suburbs to have a sophisticated and elegant meal. When my wife and I moved to Las Vegas a few years ago some friends brought us here for our first \"nice\" meal in town. We were blown away back then and on our return visit a couple days ago we were still impressed.\n\nThere wasn't a single disappointing dish. They started us off with two rolls each. The potato roll was good, but the sweet white chocolate pecan roll was delicious, with a texture like a sticky, chewy cinnamon roll.\n\nShortly after dropping off the rolls the waiter returned with an amuse bouche of goat cheese quiche with bacon. It's salty and tart flavor was a bold way to start the meal.\n\nI opted for the $55 prix fixe option -- ordering two apps and an entree. My wife ordered a la carte, getting one app and entree. It's great that Rosemary's allows customers to either order two apps and an entree or an app, entree and dessert as part of the prix fixe. That kind of flexibility is nice for people who want to skip dessert.\n\n//Appetizers//\nPanko crusted crab boulettes w/ g-ma's sweet & sour cucumbers and emulsified ravigote sauce. The cucumbers were the star of the dish with its combination of sweetness and acidity. The sauce was tangy and added good flavors to the mild tasting crab.\n\nShrimp with pistachio crusted goat cheese, avocado. This dish was a salad topped with slices of avocado, three large shrimp, and goat cheese balls. It was a deliciously refreshing and light app.\n\nButternut squash soup with chipotle aioli, pumpkin seeds and creme fraiche. There were hints of spiciness from the chipotle aioli with a sweetness provided by the creme fraiche and a nice crunchy texture from the seeds. This was one of the best butternut squash soups you'll find.\n\n//Entrees//\nSeared sea scallops w/ parsnip potato puree, crispy prosciutto, parsnip strips and apple cider beurre blanc.  Delicious scallops that didn't have any hint of gritiness. The prosciutto was so light and crispy and the beurre blanc was so creamy. In combination, all the ingredients made this an excellent dish.\n\nCrispy skin Texas striped bass w/ garlic spinach, sizzled leeks and meyer lemon caper beurre blanc. The fish was meaty and perfectly cooked. I'm not usually a fan of leeks but these were delicious. Another dish with a beurre blanc sauce, however this one didn't seem as buttery or thick as the one used with the scallops.\n\n//Dessert//\nThey dropped off a plate of mignardises to end the meal. Three bites of a lemon bar, a peanut butter dessert that was crunchy and airy, and a chocolate brownie that was dense and moist. The sweet bites were a perfect way to end the meal without leaving us feeling too full.\n\nService was very good. There were two waiters swooping in and out setting and resetting silverware, cleaning off the table, pouring water, and checking in on us. Even though they were around a lot, they were as unintrusive as possible.\n\nThe price of the meal, while not cheap, was reasonable. Armed with a $25 gift card from restaurants.com, we walked out after spending $145 (including tax tip and two drinks)."

It was OK at best. \n\nLets start from the top.\nPlace from the outside was not the typical fine dining restaurant, it's in a strip mall but I knew that from other reviews so didn't count that. \n\nGot seated right away with reservation, received menus and then sat there for 15 mins + after we closed them and put them on the side. \n\nFood: The gifts from the chef were a nice touch, they were good. \nAppetizers, the Risotto was good but heavy, the parm souffle was good as well but nothing special. \n\nEntree: Flank steak, I love flank steak because it has nice texture and flavor, this one has flavor but a little tough on certain parts, I cut my pieces against the grain but still a little chewy. \nLamb chops: good but a couple of pieces had a lot of fat still on it which made it more gamey, I know I could of just trimmed it but it's fine dining... The mushrooms under the lamb was over buttered. \n\nSo overall the food was good so 4 stars, the service was bad for fine dining standards though. The place is not big so how is it that the waiter seemed to be busy. He walked passed us a few times with his head in the clouds and ignored us. There is a waiter and his help but the waiter is the one for orders, checks, etc. He was not to be found for most of the night. \n\nService was cold. Right before Dessert he asks \" wasn't is someone's birthday\" \nYeah from the different color napkin my wife had and the person making sure she spelled my wife's name right, I assumed they would put her name on the dessert plate. Didn't happen, he probably forgot and did it last minute with a pre-done plate. \n\nOverall with all the options out there not worth it."

The menu allows you to select 1 entree and 2 other courses -- your choice of appetizers or dessert, mix and match as you please. \n\nHe started with the Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp, Sweetbreads, Cajun Ribeye Steak.  I chose the Wilted Spinach salad, Filet, and then the Coconut Bread Pudding dessert.  \n\nAMUSE BUCHE:  Whitefish salad on fried wonton chip, goat cheese mousse, roasted onion vinaigrette.  I really liked this - didn't taste the goat cheese but loved the onion dressing.  \n\nBBQ SHRIMP: the shrimp were well cooked but he felt that the bbq sauce lacked some acidity or sweetness.  I actually enjoyed the slaw with the blue cheese but he wasn't a huge fan of the dish overall. \n\nWILTED SPINACH:  This was a mound of dressed spinach leaves, with little dabs of goat cheese and pecans around it, caramelized spears of onion, and a round of fried goat cheese.  Loved the onion, wished the pecans were broken up instead of halves and thought there was too much goat cheese but liked the fried disc. \n\nSWEETBREADS:  This was well fried and well cooked.  Beware, this is a huge portion, at least fist sized!  It came with Israeli couscous, and brunoised carrot, which I actually thought was the best part of the dish. \n\nCAJUN RIBEYE:  Not sure what made this Cajun, but it wasn't as tender as we hoped and fatty.  It was served over a pile of cheesy grits. \n\nFILET OF BEEF:  Cooked as I requested, came with three little potato croquettes, which are like fancy tater tots, and 3 spears of asparagus.  This was fine but unmemorable and I was so stuffed from all the apps so really we both took the majority of our entrees home as leftovers.\n\nCOCONUT BREAD PUDDING: Tom our server recommended that we take bites of both the coconut icecream and the bread pudding in the same bite to fully enjoy the dish.  The bread pudding itself is really unexpected.  It's less of a bread pudding and more of a Vietnamese coconut pudding (no bread).  It's a gelatinous coconutty pudding haphazardly decorated with huge globs of chocolate sauce, sweetened shredded coconut, and nuts -- maybe almonds?  \n\nMore desserts!  The restaurant also brought out brownie bites, tiny lemon squares and peanut butter buckeyes.  All were great but we were so full that we just snuck a bit of each.  \n\nSERVICE: Excellent.  5/5.  The team of servers was well run, promptly refilled water and drinks, took away empty plates, brought new silverware.  Our actual waiter was slightly on the formal side but I guess I can't complain about that.  \n\nThe food is definitely solid but nothing so memorable that I'd make it a Vegas staple.  It also gives me the impression it's a suburban place trying to be fancy by throwing in blue cheese or goat cheese wherever it can."

It's obvious that they care very much about improving, even though I'd say there's no more room for improvement. \n\nFood was great, but it didn't blow my socks off like I thought it would, it's probably because I hyped it up too much in my head; it's not as innovative as I thought it would be, though everything is very well executed. The dessert was underwhelming.

The short of it is that I would definitely recommend it.\n\nOverall, the food was quite good.  We all ordered the prix fixe option, which is three courses for $55.  This is a great value, particularly for the quality and quantity of the food.  For my appetizer, I got the twice-baked Parmesan souffle.  This was the low point of the meal for me, but still not bad.  Nothing to write home about, flavor was ok.  For my entree, I got the pork chop.  I don't eat pork too much, but this was very good.  Pork seems like it's difficult to cook well, but this was well-cooked, flavorful and juicy.  Also, the portion was huge.   The best part of the meal however, was the dessert.  I ordered the dark chocolate bread pudding, which was honestly one of the best desserts I've ever had.  This was a special that they were running, but if you like dark chocolate, ask if they have it, it's AMAZING.  My three dining partners ordered the prix fixe as well, and everyone was very complimentary of their meals, two got the steak entree, one got the lamb.\n\nThe only caution that I would give is that there is absolutely nothing \"Vegas\" about this place.  It's quite a ways from the strip, dimly lit, in a strip mall.  It was definitely an older crowd as well.  There's nothing wrong with this, but if you're looking for a trendy Vegas experience, this is definitely not it.  It's just really good food.  The only complaint I had, which is small, is that they kind of bombard you with service.  They had two people assigned to our table, and seemed to interrupt us several times to announce that they were refilling the water and stuff like that.  Good service, but a bit unsubtle for me."

Not only did the staff at Rosemary's acknowledge his accomplishment; they went over and above to make us feel welcome, to congratulate him and to celebrate with us... a sure sign of a restaurant that values it's guests knows the importance of personal touch. The ambiance was warm and romantic and our server Tom, was incredibly sincere,  and just the right amount of attentive.  \n\nNow on to the food... GOOD GOD!\n\nWe decided to go for it and order the chef's tasting menu with the wine pairings.  Rosemary's has a lot of different menu options from very reasonably priced to much more expensive.  Because we had such a good vibe, we really wanted to put it in the chef's hands and experience all that they had to offer... we were so very glad that we did.\n\nWhat followed were five courses of the most exquisite, stunning and delictely prepared food; perfectly paired with five diverse and delicious wines.  We were amazed.  Each and every dish was perfect... absolutely perfect, and so special.

Wow, I am still thinking about the succulent dark chocolate truffle that came on our freebie chef's sampler dessert plate.  We ordered two prix fixes, one of which came with the much worshiped twice baked parmesan souffle with morels.  Both of our fish entrees (barramundi and striped sea bass) were excellent.  The only lackluster item was the rolls.  Service was great without being pretentious.  I bumped my reservation the same evening after we got back late from climbing, which wasn't a problem.  The restaurant called the following day for feedback, which I didn't find intrusive.\n\nUpdate:\nAfter a second visit I'm bumping my review down a star.  The wait staff were helpful as always.  There was a glitch with our order, so we were given an additional appetizer of our choice (squash risotto with basil pesto and goat cheese cream sauce) gratis.  We ordered the prix fixes again, this time with parmesan souffle, flat iron steak, goat cheesecake, crab cakes, Japanese sea bass, and pecan pie.  The squash risotto (a daily special) and pecan pie were both stellar.  The rich carmelly pie was the best I've had.  The souffle wasn't as good as our previous visit.  The crab cakes were run of the mill and I found the bass to be bland underneath the super salty panko/prosciutto crust.  I also didn't care for the sauce that came with the steak.  Maybe it was an off night."

I couldn't decide on the rib-eye or lamb so I asked the waiter who was quite helpful, and actually said he preferred the veal but the lamb is the house specialty. So I had the lamb and it was a very good choice.  Wife had the scallops and they were done to perfection.  We were expecting a few smaller scallops like other \"fine\" dining places so it was nice they didn't skimp out.\n\nOnly thing that slightly disappointed what that they immediately asked about food allergies and wife said no gluten.  They seemed to understand but then brought out an amuse bouche that had bread.  They did apologize and brought another, cold poached pears which was actually better than the first one.  However the dessert amuse bouche they didn't do anything special and there were little cake things included.  It was not that busy either so it wasn't like they were rushed off their feet.\n\nI can eat bread but they never bothered to offer me any, not a huge deal to me but to others it probably would have been."

But this restaurant isn't like buying a ring from Zales, it's more like Tiffany's. Partners in crime Chefs Michael and Wendy Jordan are true artisans whos \"New American\", or whatever is the best way to describe their deliciousness, style cuisine is an experience all to itself. It's fine dining folks so I put it as one of those places where you get dressed up to eat. Where you buy a bottle of wine and take your time. Where you compliment the chef and the staff. This place is a treat and you treat someone special and start new memories.\n\nOk enough of the touchy feely and on to the food. Ok have you ever watched those TV cooking competitions like Top Chef or Chopped where they throw words out like confit, amuse bouche and reductions of this and that and use ingredients like foie gras and it looks super delicious but you're thinking to yourself \"I don't know what the hell that is but I wish I could get some of that.!\". Well here you go, here's your chance minus the pretentiousness that you think goes with eating it.  But worry not, they have totally approachable treats like pork chops, salmon, pasta and salads but it's probably the best damn chops, salmon, pasta and salad you've ever had or at least in your top 3 best. They have a small plates menu that'll knock your socks off. And again it's approachable with things like quesadillas, fries, sliders and pie but like the dinner menu it's the best damn quesadilla you'll ever have. What I love is that with each course they have suggestions of the perfectly complimentary wine or beer pairing to really make it a true dining experience. You can't say this very often but this place has class. Class Vegas, class."

So I was hoping this would live up to his claims. We all were going to go for the prixe fix menu until we noticed that it may be cheaper to go a la carte. I was the only one who strayed and did three appetizers. I was going to get the scallops as a main but there was a special of scallops offered as an app and I was already afraid of having too much food. Looks like I was right because even ordering three starters overfilled me. Not a happy stuffed, but an uncomfortable stuffed. The little freebie desserts weren't even touched and went straight into a box for our table. We were all overfed and would've preferred smaller portions. \n\nFor the food: Overall very nice but my scallop appetizer was a miss. It was too sweet with the sweet potatoes and not a good flavor pairing. The parmesan souffle was to die for. I ordered the mixed baby greens but was brought a different salad that was delicious, so no hard feelings. It had shallots that were so good I made everyone at the table try a bite (must re-create at home!). Fiance got the veal porterhouse and it was amazing. Perfectly cooked. The desserts that others ordered were passed around but everyone could only manage a bite or two being so full from the previous two courses. I wasn't too impressed with the desserts. Nothing memorable. \n\nThe two dings against the restaurant... Our friends pointed out a couple of errors with the French that was written on menu/labels. I hope they get that fixed! The second was a lady's night where girls eat half off/ free. I thought our waitress was talking about something on the strip until I realized it was for this restaurant. Kinda left a bad taste in my mouth... why cheapen your fine establishment with... ladies night? Weird. \n\nWould I return? Absolutely. I would just order two courses though."

I had better food and a better time here than at Wynn's Daniel last time (food was good there but service was a bit stuffy).\n\nWe went on a Wednesday so it was Ladies Night which meant everything (except alcohol) was 50% off for ladies.  My party of four each got the 5-course chef's tasting menu (normally $65) and it was absolutely delicious.  We started off with rich salmon tartare topped with American caviar, followed by a giant bacon crusted scallop on top of yam and chestnut puree (yuMMMM), grilled sea bass, a medium rare grilled filet of beef (super tender and meaty in taste), and a trio of desserts.  Their goat cheese cheesecake is to die for - it's super smooth and rich in taste but the sweetness is not so overpowering that you want to wash it down with coffee immediately.   I wonder if I can order it via mail...hmmmmm.  \n\nTheir service also exceeded my expectation - attentive, friendly, and not overly pretentious (which I find annoying at Strip restaurants).  There's no sommelier pressuring you to order the most expensive wine on the list.  They were great with getting your chair every time we got up, replacing utensils at each course, etc.  Tables were nicely spaced so you can talk at a normal voice level without feeling like the next table is sitting in your lap.  Basically, laugh out loud if you want =)\n\nI would definitely go back for dinner and also try their lunch prix-fixe ($25) on the weekdays if I have a chance.   Sunday is also half-price wine night!\n\nRosemary's is about 20 minutes from the Strip (calculating from the Wynn) and kind of obscurely located in a giant strip mall but it was definitely worth the drive.  Parking is free and plentiful."

Good thing I noticed the bacon right as the plate was being set down because nobody ever came to ask if our entrees were okay.  The chocolate cake was very dry, luckily it came with an espresso sauce and ice cream to soak into the cake and make it edible. The pricing was reasonable--$28 for a 3 course prix fixe lunch (I think they only serve lunch on Fridays).  The presentation of all the dishes is really nice.  I get that they are trying to keep costs down, but the place was a bit shabby (padding on seats was worn down and years of dust accumulated on light fixtures).

As the taxi meter kept climbing, I started to be less excited because I was starting to worry it would not be worth the trip. BELIEVE ME, IT'S TOTALLY WORTH THE TAXI RIDE!\nWe had 3 people and we all did the $55 prix-fixe dinner. I did the Parmesan Souffle for the appetizer, the Flat Iron Steak for the entree, and the Creme Brulee for dessert. The Parmesan Souffle was a great starter - light, fluffy, flavorful with this amazing shitake mushroom cream sauce and creamed leeks on the side. The Flat Iron Steak fell short - a little dry and covered in \"Rosemary's Own Steak Sauce\". This sauce just tasted like A1 to me, but maybe I don't have a refined palette. I did enjoy the mushrooms and asparagus on the sides and the dish was plated beautifully. Lastly the Creme Brulee - Simple and very tasty. They also wrote Happy Birthday along the edge of the plate and served it with a candle.\nThe service was amazing. They pull the chair out for you and slide it under you as you sit. They give you a black napkin for dark pants, and white for light pants. They bring all of the food at the same time in a choreographed fashion. The waitress was extremely nice and very helpful in explaining the menu. What was important was that I felt comfortable despite getting all this great service. The restaurant has a very comforting ambiance, almost like a quiet country home. \nWe ended up spending $100/person since we had wine and my friend ordered Foie Gras (tasted amazing from the one bite I had) which had a surcharge for some reason. Despite the cost, the overall experience was amazing. 5 stars!"

The waiters brought by a black napkin to match my black pants (and refolded the napkins every time one of us got up from our chairs.) The lunch special included a choice of appetizer, main and dessert.\n\nEverything was delicious. For appetizers we tried the Texas BBQ Shrimp with Maytag blue cheese coleslaw: a healthy serving of shrimp with a tasty BBQ sauce. The blue cheese coleslaw was fresh and went perfectly with the shrimp (think buffalo chicken gone gourmet.) The salads were also excellent, the mixed baby greens tossed in a champagne vinaigrette with smoked salmon, quail egg, capers, house-made cucumbers, and drizzles of saffron aioli, was delicious as well as the arugula, endive and radicchio salad with Maytag blue cheese, Riesling poached pear, toasted hazelnuts and port wine syrup. I highly recommend both options.\n\nThe vegetarian main of fresh mozzarella and slow roasted tomato stuffed eggplant \"packages\" with roasted red bell peppers, green olive relish, and smoked tomato butter sauce was a little disappointing. The eggplant hadn't been cooked long enough and was a bit tough and bitter. Still, the smoked tomato flavor was really delicious. The creole seasoned shrimp with Anson Mills Carolina cheesy quick grits, Andouille red bean sauce, and grilled green onion was amazing. The smokiness of the Andouille went really well with the dish. All the portions were large and it was difficult to conceive of dessert.\n\nEven so, we finished our meal with the rustic apple tart with caramel sauce, candied walnuts and cinnamon ice cream, as well as a selection of sorbet (made in-house.) All were very good, with the apple tart being particularly delicious.\n\nRosemary's is on the pricey side, so I would recommend getting the lunch deal (and arriving hungry!)"

You ever get waiter envy? You know, like you're eating at a restaurant and you happen to notice the people next to you get a waiter serving them that is so much better than the one you got? Oh man. I was so coveting my neighbors waiter! \n\nIf I were to say the service was flat out horrible, that would imply that there was any level of service. There was none. This had to be the waiter experience ever. \n\nMade reservations for 8, got seated by 8:05, Waiter 2 came and took water request. Waiter 1 came by to give us menus by 8:15... disappeared for a good 20 minutes without explaining the food menu at all even though we told him that it was our first time. \n\nAlso note.. two waiters? Hmmm. Okay, one was for clean up and the other was the \"main waiter\" \n\nWaiter 2 brings us silver wear around 8:20. 8:25 passes.. oddly enough, no water still. 8:30 I finally flag him down and ask \"where's the water?\" He's surprised and you can tell he forgot. He goes back and gets water quickly. Well, at least he came back. Waiter 1 still has not shown back up from giving us our menus at 8:15 and it's now 8:40\n\nI could not hear waiter when he first explained menu from my side of the table, so I get my order placed in wrongly for the three course pre-fixed menu. He ask what do we want to drink.. We never got a drink menu.. Ugh, \n\nBy 8:50 we finally have our order placed. Sitting there 50 minutes and our food was barely ordered because of disappearing waiter. Was he performing at the Rio with Penn & Teller?!? \n\nHe comes back with drink menu, we place order.. he comes back and tells us one drink is out.. he offers no suggestions as to what would be like it. \n\nFirst course comes out around 9:15 - it's pretty decent. Texas shrimp were tasty. Not too bad. NOT WORTH THE DAMN HOUR AND 15 MINUTE WAIT IT'S BEEN SO FAR! \n\nWe sit there for a good 30 minutes and no one's checked on us, no one's done anything. The people to my right have the same waiter and they mention how bad the service is and how the person sitting on my side of the table couldn't hear the waiter either when he explained the menu. \n\nAt this point I'm pretty damn peeved. Where's this great service? An hour and forty five minutes later I get a manager and tell them, what the hell. The lack of service was killing me. The entree finally comes out after which I've been complaining. You can tell the wait staff got a mouth full from her as there's tension there. \n\nSteak was cooked rare when ordered med, my bass was tasty, but it was made bitter from this extra long wait. At this point we just had a bad taste in our mouths and, well.. the whole night had been ruined. \n\nWhen traveling we generally do one \"fancy meal\" and this was expected to be that fancy meal. It turned out to a disaster and we just wanted out of there. \n\nWhat made it worse was that through the whole wait period we couldn't help but notice the table to my left who had a different waiter who was getting amazing service. She was on top of her game. She went down the menu and explained it perfectly. I mean, I couldn't even hear our waiter from the other side of the table and yet this other waiter was talking loud and clear enough that I could hear her two tables down. \n\nShe also had a situation where the wine that was ordered was out and she went down a list of other recommendations as to what to replace it with in terms of same likeness. I mean, this waiter was something else. It made our situation with our waiter feel so much worse. Like; \"You mean to tell me that if we only sat two tables down this whole night would have been so much better?\" \n\nNow I know how it feels to piss your quarters away at a slot machine and then have the person one machine over win the jack pot. \n\nBut this nightmare wasn't over yet. We were done. We didn't want to eat anymore. The appitite was so an hour and thirty minutes ago. So we asked them to box it up... Which leads to an even more awkward situation.. um.. how do I trust someone who just got a verbal ass kicking because of me? \n\nI don't think I ever trusted any left overs less than I did that box that came out...\n\nThen they asked if we wanted dessert forgetting that it came with one of the pre-fixed meals... thanks. \n\nThe manager that night apologized and gave me her card. Why? I have no idea. She deducted about 60% off the bill.. But even then, $40 for what amounted to appetizers and the worse service I have ever received? Yeah, no thanks. I have 700 reviews and only 50 1 stars... that should tell you something about how I felt completely fucked coming here.\nReservation for 8pm\n25 min for water\n50min to order\n1hr45min to get food\nLeft there almost by 11pm \nWORSE MEAL & EXPERIENCE EVER!!"

I've been eating here so long that I don't remember and its ALWAYS good eats.\n\nStarting with the bar... awesome wine list and one of the best beer selections I've ever seen... coolest part is that they serve your beer with the authentic class that it was intended for it.  Very nice touch.  Also about the bar you can eat there or at the 4 or 5 two person high tops.  This makes for a nice dinner without feeling the need to be too fancy [as in the dining area].\n\nThe dining room is split into two areas the first of which has the California style open kitchen.  This makes it easy to see real professional chefs at work (Michael Jordan and his wife).  Michael trained under Legase and I believe his wife in New Orleans.  The combination makes an awesome menu (which they update very often).  Whatever the Prix Fixe menu offers is always great.\n\nJust a few of my favorite standards:\n\nHugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp (based on family recipe) - awesome\nAny Risotto on the menu (changes) - awesome\nProscuito Crusted Salmon (one of my fiances favorites) - awesome\nMaytag Blue Cheese Slaw (one of the great sides) - super\n\nAlso important... ladies nite is Wednesday and everything is 1/2 off for them.  Sundays is 50% off all bottled wine.  Final note, sign up for the various wine and beer tasting events they have... they pair great food and great wine and I've never been sorry.  Neither will you be.\n\nEnjoy!"

The food was also above board - my father made the comment, \"man, this is the only place I've been that can make a chicken breast without giving me a dry piece of meat.\"  High praise from dad who is rather culinarily challenged and measures food on a scale of \"MMMMM\" and \"tastes funny.\"  I personally enjoyed my meal and will definitely hit that place again when I go back.\n\nThe biggest attraction though, the service.  Not only did the waiter explain everything to my father rather patiently, but he also knew exactly what wine to recommend with each dish.  Oh and the desserts at the end - awesome.  It was even better that when the waiter heard my parents were leaving that night, he packed more into a to-go box for my pops whose face lit up like a Christmas tree upon eating some of the candies."

Great service.\n\nI've been to Rosemary's twice in the last year, but that should be prefaced with the fact that I live in Honolulu, HI and have been to Vegas only twice in the last year.  Rosemary's has fast become part of my Vegas routine.\n\nBoth times I was here, I opted for a three course dinner -  you can go with an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $55 or you can go two appetizers and an entree for $65.  In my most recent visit in May 2011, my date opted to go with the chef's tasting menu- a five course dinner coupled with either a glass of beer or wine per course which was approximately $120.  The option per the menu were either all beer or all wine, but the manager was very accomodating in letting us choose one or the other per course.  I love the fact that the menu includes a recommended beer and wine pairing, with the vast assortment of beers and wines available, the recommended pairings complemented the food very well.\n\nNotable standouts - the risotto, lamb, veal, and for dessert, the \"adult\" ice cream float (almond ice cream with rasberry beer) and creme brulee were excellent.  I'm getting excited just thinking about my next trip to Rosemary's..."

You have some of the best food I have EVER eaten.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  Service was very attentive during the meal.  We elected to have the prix fixe menu which includes one entree and two sides or desserts for $55 per person.  The meal began with fresh baked rolls, one with a white chocolate filling which was OH SO GOOD!  I had a mushroom soup that was perfectly flavored while my boyfriend had a chilled avocado shrimp soup that was also fantastic.  These were followed by an asparagus salad topped with goat/blue cheese, bacon pieces and boiled potatoes/onions.  There were so many flavors in this salad, but they blended together perfectly.  For the main course I chose the prosciutto-covered veal and my boyfriend had halibut.  Both were perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  We finished the night with their cheesecake....so light and airy.  Next time I come to Vegas I am spending all of my time here instead of watching the drunk skanks on the strip."

The three course prixe fix was $27! This is definitely an amazing value. \n\nThe food was a little hit or miss for me. For my three courses, I went with a cauliflower soup, wilted winter green salad and the Jidori chicken. The soup was good. The wilted salad was delicious! Definitely the winner of the evening for me. However, the chicken was teetering dangerously on the edge of being overcooked, and when it originally arrived at the table it was perched on a moat of red sauce that was not tasty (and it wasn't visually appealing). We actually had them replate the chicken without the sauce, as there was no way to avoid it. I had visions of a juicy, tender succulent chicken, but this did not happen on my visit.\n\nMy husband swooned over their angel hair with crawfish small plate, but he had to send back a burnt scallop dish. The server remedied the situation promptly and did not charge us for the dish, so kudos for service!\n\nStill, the overall impression was that there was just a little something off in the kitchen that night, or perhaps the real winners on the menu are the seafood items or something else I didn't order. I would definitely return to give them a second taste, as I really love an off the Strip place focusing on providing fine, American dining! Plus, how can I possibly resist those Wednesday night deals!"

So the hubs dutifully went to Costco and purchased their gift certificates ($100 for $79.99). It is pretty impossible to spend all of the money on one go (it's a lot of food), so we tried about 70% of their savory menu on two visits. (please check out the pics for info on individual menu items).\n\nThe good - even though we were sitting at the bar, we received great service by the staff. It was also nice that they offered amuse bouches, bread service (love the still warm white chocolate pecan roll) as well as a small plate of mignardises (lemon bars are my favs). You simply do not get this kind of service at any other happy hour bar menu anywhere else.\n\nThe bad and the ugly - the best thing on the menu were the things that required the least cooking (ie, the cheese plate and the deli meat plate). Given our past experiences here, I was surprised by the quality of dishes we tasted.\n\nFrom the poorly grilled scallop (burnt in places, lacking a nice golden crust) served with a flavourless quinoa to the odd duo of tartars (too many ingredients mixed into the dish made you lose the aroma of the beef and salmon - plus the hard boiled egg it was scooped in kind of overwhelmed the food), there is clearly an execution issue here. Their version of a croque madame was one huge soggy mess. The quesadilla was overly heavy due to the avocado and really needed some acidity to provide balance.\n\nIn addition to the execution issues, there are also problems with how certain things were thought out. Who the hell wants to eat french fries shaved so thin that it's hard to eat even with a fork (plus, it loses it's crispiness quickly)? Or have a caesar salad crouton that is so big that you can't even get your mouth around let alone cut? Or a filet slider served overloaded with weird Asian flavoured pickles (I think the burger could potential receive signals from outer space) that don't go well with the burger at all?\n\nI wanted to really love their bar menu but it was nothing but a disappointment. If it was for the service alone, I'd give this place a four but unfortunately the food just didn't hold up to standards of the dining room. For that, Rosemary's gets a  3 starred review and removed from my Vegas Hit List."

We had a party of six and were seated in a more private part of the restaurant.  It was the best service I have ever experienced.  The multiple servers were incredibly attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  On to the food -- delicious does not even begin to describe the food!  I decided to get the 5 course tasting menu ($80 without alcohol).  The first dish was a duo of tartars -- salmon and beef tartar.  It was served with a few capers, a light lemon yuzu, and crisps to eat all the delicious yumminess. Course two was a Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes with emulsified ravigote sauce and sweet and sour cucumbers.  They cucumbers were the perfect addition to the fried boulettes.  Course three was sesame seared arctic char served with sho-mai vegetable slaw and ginger soy butter sauce.  I could have had three servings of this because it was soooo good.  By course four, I thought I was going to die, but I had a little talk with my stomach and managed to devour the roasted rack of lamb served with kalamata olive mashed potatoes and fried arugula.  Course five was a trio of desserts -- creme brulee (perfect), a mini chocolate cream pie (good but not memorable), and a shot of a framboise shake (a take on a rootbeer float but made with framboise beer -- delicious!).  Other diners had the ribeye and said it was the best they had ever had (and they regularly dine at place like Cut, BLT, STK, Morton's, etc.)  Everyone said it was one of the best meals they had ever had.  So, Vegas, you may have taken my money at the blackjack table, but I definitely won the culinary battle.\nSincerely,\nStill Recovering in Los Angeles"

I thought, \"there is no way a fancy restaurant would be located here!\" Then we pulled into the parking lot/plaza and thought, seriously?! It looks like a local mom & pop restaurant! I exclaimed to my hubby at how overdressed we could be for this restaurant. We shrugged it off and agreed we'd go in for the sake of trying something new! \n\nAnd so we did...\n\nWow! The service was exceptional! The food was so delicious...my taste buds and brain were so happy as was my soul! I highly recommend the scallop dish! It was so full of flavor, I couldn't ask for a more tastier meal! The waiters were very respectful, friendly and provided us service that I dreamed I'd receive only if I were a celebrity! The place was subtle, not overly decorated but provided an intimate home-y atmosphere, and the staff treated us as if we were the only ones there! To welcome us for our first visit, we were showered with delicious treats from appetizers to desserts! \n\nThe food was on the pricey end (about $30-$50 plates) but very much worth it! The restaurant also has a prefixed menu for $55/person that includes appetizer, salad, main dish and dessert!"

Had 5:30pm Resv. but found the place already buzzing due to 50% ladies night. Didn't even know.....50% off? Yes! extra money for the vino.  Celebrated my  wife's bday and it was worth every cent.  \nThe apptz. were carpaccio & sweet breads- Unbelievable!.  So delicious were these choices, we actually added the foie gras - smile~tear drop!\nShared Wilted Lettuce Salad- very nice refresher b/f entree.\n\nEntree was lamb for me. Terrific as everyone else has pointed out so I won't, but my wife's Butterfish in prosciutto / panko bread crumbs was \"outta this world\" superb. It was the best seafood dish I have ever tasted!!\nWine and more wine....then nice desert to celebrate the bday which they did a great job picking this up off my 'comments' when making the reservation on line at Open Table.com\nHats off to our dynamic duo Servers - Matt & Tony (please forgive if i miss one of your names....it's your fault for bringing me the wine!).  They took exceptional care of us the whole night.  The thing that impressed me the most is they actually came back to ensure I meant to add more to the Tip.  I'll try to explain:\nEven though he explained when he brought me the check, *burp* I didn't quite grasp *burp* that he had already added the gratuity based on my wife's half price entree @ full price, then discounted the tkt.\nI added tip as usual....one, because I felt it was worth it & 2...the vino.  He made sure to alert me to this and offered for me to scratch out.  Instead I initialed the additional tip.  You don't typically find such honesty, unfortunately.  This was just outstanding character and a reflection of the Associates of Rosemary's.\n\nThis is a special kind of place that you don't really want to keep a running total in your head of what is being spent....the pre-fix is the way to go, enjoy, splurge....skip another fancy meal some time later.  Trust me.\n\nThis is a cozy place and all was great until towards the end when a table of 6 young \"hotties\" were seated next to us.  Personally, I am all for well dress ladies in strappy jimmy choos.....But, they lacked the proper Restaurant ettiquette by not keeping their conversation centered at their own table.  I really didn't care they were going to rent out  a villa on the strip..\"oh my gawd\".  Sorry for my little tangent......"

The service was really courteous with our waiters. \n\nHowever i think this place deserves a 3-star because of my seating experiences. Both times i was being seated near the kitchen and both times i had requested another seat but the girl at the front did not response to that. The first time i was there it was quite busy, but i had made a request prior my second visit. I must say that i find the size of the dinning room/ kitchen to be quite tiny and the kitchen here is just not aesthetic enough to look at all night. The restaurant is located in a strip mall setting, and i honestly hope for something a little more in its decor /ambiance in consistency with the food. For almost the same price you would pay at hotels etc i will choose a place that offers more."

            "review": "The taxi ride was longer than I remembered, but that was probably because any recollection I had of Rosemary's was about the food. Twenty minutes off the Strip, Rosemary's graces its own strip (mall), where Chefs Michael and Wendy Jordan continue to rival any contortionist Cirque show for creativity and flawless execution. \n\nA flash of Mary Poppins extracting a coat rack from her carpetbag flooded my mind as I stepped from molten asphalt into a bath of beige and black. Somehow this desert mirage remained immune to the venom Vegas spit on the Strip. There was a whiff of reality here (along with deep breaths of garlic) and our initial steps inward lowered our temperature 10 degrees. \n\nThey had expanded the space since my last visit in 2003 and it suited them well. An outstretched bar beckoned us with an array of elixirs and Venetian tendencies (as in Venice, Italy, not the Venetian, Vegas), basing neutral hues behind vibrant artwork. This \"breath of fresh air entrance\" flowed into the warm yellows and soft sconces of the dining room. \n\nOur twenty something waitress was enthusiastic, but much too comfortable with her use of the word \"sucked,\" which hacked through the fine dcor like a pick axe. Her dialectic destruction was buffed out by the open arms of an amuse bouche and I accepted the crispy wanton topped with salmon mousse and citrus aioli as a refreshing, bite-sized \"welcome\". Choices of bread like pecan wheat or macadamia white chocolate also opened with gregarious \"how-do-you- dos.\" \n\nBesides \"gutter mouth gal\", service was a highlight here and a main reason for my return. Collaboration of courses played out in a choreographed routine, where waiters lifted silver covers and distributed plates in unison. Jazz hands- appetizers had arrived. Smitten as kittens we mewed with delight at the saucers placed before us, but upon tasting the first option, hissing (and spitting) became more our demeanor. \n\nHugo's Texas BBQ shrimp with Maytag blue cheese slaw was a Hugo disappointment. Smokey was the bandit, unmentioned and unwelcome, in the barbeque sauce with its distinct embers lingering on my palate like match-heads. I was more disappointed by an insufficient menu description than the actual dish (some people like smoky) and this formidable food decision weighed on my mind as heavily as the soggy, blue cheese slaw accompanying it. \n\nThe grass wasn't much greener on the salad side. I thought I was down at the boon docks with the smell that emanated from my Caesar and though anchovies are a necessary component for this classic, they in no way should be the prominent flavor (or smell). \n\nI hesitated to think that maybe my idea of the food was remembered too grandly from either multiple bottles of wine or a love for this opulent oasis, but then it appeared as a bird? A plane? No...Fabulous Fig! Donning a proscuitto cape and accompanied by his goat cheese sidekick (stuffed, snuggly inside), this salty, sweet superhero saved the day (a triumphant cheer went out over the crowd) and just like that, the cogs of this well (olive) oiled machine slid back into place. \n\nPossibly to make up for my prior disappointments, culinary karma delivered one of the most prolific entres ever to grace my lips. I believe that day my journal entry read, \"Today I became a woman.\" Their veal filet had me throwing my head back and grunting involuntarily, similar to the overplayed scene from \"When Harry met Sally...\" Green lentils exploded like salty sparklers and bacon confetti rained on the sherry mustard butter sauce like it was a holiday- it sure felt like one. This could possibly be the best piece of meat I've ever had (#1 meat entree nationwide). \n\nThe rack of lamb also managed magnificent feats of flavor, seeping natural juices into Kalamata olive mashed potatoes and blending with the rosemary bordelaise (a reduction of red wine, shallots and demi-glace) to form a potent jus.\n\nWe didn't have room for dessert, but that didn't matter- they brought it anyway. Peanut butter truffles, dark chocolate truffles and lemon squares were presented as their \"after dinner amuse bouche\" and was a tasty metaphor that symbolized what Rosemary's brought to the table- tangible appreciation. \n\nPlaying to each olfactory sense, Rosemary's fine tuned performance gave an experience, rather than a meal. Even our two unfavorable selections were forgiven like a teenager's bad attitude, squashed by the overall success of the show. Somehow Rosemary's continues to elicit one of Vegas's most jaw dropping (and closing) illusions, where humble elegance outshines the neon bulbs.\n\nCoined as a rarity here, Rosemary's elcits one of Vegas's most jaw dropping (and closing) illusions, where humble elegance outshines the neon bulbs."

The lamb really should have been thrown out rather than served.  The rest of the items were not good at all, except for the parmesan souffle which I agree is delish.  All in all the food was just okay and really, don't bother driving off the strip for this one.

My wife and I were visiting my brother who lives in Summerlin. It was a holiday weekend so I was sure we were not going to get a reservation at any of the fine dining restaurants on the strip. Plus I wanted to avoid the strip dining at all costs during the weekend. So we decided to check this place out based on the reviews and hoo-boy did they deliver. Service was superb. I knew we were eating at a special place when they asked if we wanted to change the color of our dinner napkins. Who the hell does that? Then they asked us if we had any food allergies. Score. I happen to have a walnut,pecan and freshwater fish allergy. This was the first time all year a waiter asked me about food allergies. Our server was Thomas and his assistant was Joe. They rocked! They were attentive but not breathing down our necks. They checked in frequently and made us feel very welcome. \nWe started with an amuse bouche of pear poached in Riesling. Pear held it's own and was not overpowered by the alcohol and tasted very clean and crisp. Fine opener. They have different ordering styles, a chef's tasting menu, price fixed for $55/person, or a la carte. We decided to go with the price fixed. Great value. \nFor starters I had Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes w/Emulsified Ravigote Sauce & G-ma's Sweet & Sour Cucumbers. The sour cucumbers balanced the sweetness and richness of the crab. The Boulettes were ping-pong ball sized savory bites lump crab meat. My wife had the Twice Baked Parmesan Souffl\u00e9 w/Garlic Cream & Wild Mushrooms. The star of this dish was the earthly mushrooms which balanced the richness of the cheese. \nWe picked two of the meat dishes from the entrees. I had the veal wrapped with prosucitto. The crisp saltiness of the veal balanced out the rich tender meat. The fingerling potatoes were ok a bit firm. The peppercorn sauce was ok it didn't overwhelm the dish. My wife had the rib-eye which ended up being the star of the evening. A perfectly cooked large portion of meat with a charred crust and meat tender. What kicked up the dish was the awesome homemade steak sauce. It basically elevated the dish from a great steak to foodgasm! We had to restrain ourselves from fighting over the dish and save room for dessert. \nWe finished this great meal with dessert which was more than generous. I had the creme brulee, my wife had a flourless chocolate cake I think, and we also got free tasting dessert. Noice. \nDinner here made our weekend memorable. \n\nTLDR: \n\nService-Best I had in recent memory \nFood-Great value for Great Food;Best Steak I had all year. \nSetting-Perfect for those who want to eat great food off the strip\n\nDefinately will return to order the Rib-eye."

Thanks to Yelp, we found this gem of a little restaurant for our celebration dinner.  Better yet, I was also able to purchase the $ 25 gift certificate for $ 2 at Restaurant.com using a coupon code.   The only requirement in using the certificate was to just spend $ 50.   At first, my wife was a little hesitant, especially seeing that the location was off the strip.  But I showed her all the glowing reviews from fellow Yelpers, and she thought it was worth a try.  \n\nWe arrived and no kidding, this place is in the middle of a strip mall...not to much to look at from the outside.  Once inside, the surroundings were very nice and classy.  The service was prompt, we were seated in a nice little corner.  To our delight, we were congratulated by the staff at least 5 times within the first 10 minutes of sitting down....nice that the make it a point to acknowledge the special occasion. \n\nLooking through the menu I was first pleasantly surprised at some of the items...Foie Gras, Sweet Breads, Aussie Barramundi...they don't mess around.  We both opted for the Prix Fixe menu.  I had the Crab Boulet to start, while my wife had a nice spinach salad topped with hazelnuts, blue cheese, and pears.   Both were delicious, the boulet was crispy on the outside and soft and chewy inside...and had a nice bit of crab in it too...reminded me of a cross between a crab cake and a hush puppy.  Honestly, I was quite full by the time I finished the third boulet....I know they give you three of these puppies!\n\nAs we waited for the entree to arrive, the chef sent over a nice tasting of something he was thinking of putting on the menu....vegetable bread pudding.  Sounds a little iffy, but not at all.  This would make a great side dish!  For the main course, my wife had the halibut, and I had the grilled cajun prime rib eye steak.  Both dishes were great! The fish was cooked perfectly, a nice crispy crust while still tender and moist on the inside.   My steak...at a loss for words..da bomb.!  Easily \"The\" best steak I've had anywhere, to top it off this thing was huge...20 0z, and was served with a side of some incredible cheese grits, and a nice wine sauce.   Needless to say after this, we were stuffed (I was only able to polish off 1/2 of the steak at best).  \n\nNow for desert, I had the apple tart served ala mode with a side of vanilla ice cream and my wife had the chocolate bread pudding served with banana ice cream and side of peanut butter sauce.   Both deserts were great, but they wouldn't stop sending food...the chef then sent us a tasting of hand made chocolates....were in a food coma by this point. \n\nBottom line, this is a great place for any occasion. What made the restaurant stood out was not just the eclectic menu, but most of all its the service.  I saw numerous times where the wait staff nearly tripped over themselves trying to beat a guest to their table so that they could pull out the chair!  Yeah...there are those fancy and pricey restaurants on the strip, but for 1/2 the price you get the same high quality exquisitely prepared food with a staff that will put most restaurants to shame...nuff said."

Instead, it is hidden away in a small business complex with very little signage on the outside.  However, once inside, you will be treated to as good a dining ambiance as any - although I would not say that it was terribly romantic.  \n\nSince we had dinner on Sunday all bottles of wine are half off so we ordered a Burgundy Pinot Noir.  The wine was nice.  My friend commented that the prices may have been a little inflated but the half-price was nice.  We all ordered pris-fixe meals that cost $50 for an entree plus two dishes (either appetizers, soup, salad).  The appetizers were good including stuffed figs, which were a little too creamy for me but extremely tasty; salmon tartare - standard salmon tartare but very well done.  The beef carpaccio we had was good but I also had that earlier in the day for lunch and it was better then - Country Club restaurant at Wynn.  This was due to the blue cheese overpowering the beef.  \n\nI was a bit disappointed by the entrees.  Admittedly, I allowed the waiter to convince me to order the seared tuna which has never been a favorite of mine.  It came nicely prepared - raw with the top and bottom seared.  However, it was relatively tasteless.  The only entree worth mentioning was the scallops which were fresh and tasty.  One of my friends doesn't like ham so she ordered it without the prosciutto and I still found it to be extremely tasty.  The halibuts we ordered were very bland.  \n\nWe had desserts but all of them were pretty normal.  I would say comparable to eating the desserts at a buffet in Vegas.  Nice but not great.  \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my dinner here but the food wasn't so amazing that I would ever crave going back there.  I recommend the restaurant but I would suggest people not to go in with incredible expectations - which is what other reviews seem to indicate."
