            "review": "In town for a conference and a vendor treated us to this place.  Since we had a larger group, we had a fixed menu.  They started with Sake.  HUGE bottle which probably costed an arm and a leg but it was super smooth!  Tasted like a fine wine.  Nothing like sake at all since I'm used to the cheap stuff that normally tastes like dirty dish water.  Quality options here!  \n\nFood started coming out in small tapas like plates that you can share.  I don't know what the dishes were called but dish after dish was simply amazing!  From Lobster sashimi to Wagyu beef, it was an awesome meal!  I actually had another dinner planned at a steakhouse but after tasting the food and drinking the sake here, I knew I had to cancel the other date.  \n\nGlanced at the bill on the way out and it was easily 4 figures.  Pricey place but they can walk the walk since the food and drinks were top notch.  I might come here again on my own, but only if I come up big at the tables."

            "review": "This visit was one of those bittersweet ends. An end to what has always been a memorable experience. I remember discovering this place almost 9 years ago and since that discovery it honestly has been one of my favorite restaurants. The news of its closing saddended me a bit but I understand going out while still on top. They had a good run and I look forward to the new morimoto. \n\nDinner here the other night was like always exceptional. Service of course like every other visit was top notch. Ed, our server was pleasant, suggestive, friendly and even a little funny here and there. Service is a big deal in this industry and Ed has perfected that skill with his own added pizazz. I really hope I continue to see him even when Morimotos starts to create their legacy here in Vegas.\n\nHamachi jalape\u00f1o and kapachi sashimi never fails to satisfy. The shishito peppers were a bit different this time, it came with an added sauce drizzled on top. I always loved the shishito peppers how it came before but change isn't always bad. Best oyster tasting...still my favorite is the yuzu truffle. Cod was amazing softest fish I've ever had with so much flavor. Scallops cooked in uni butter still makes my mouth water. \n\nAll in all, it was nothing short of a perfect dinner. I will miss you Shibuya!!!"

            "review": "Love this place!!!\n\n  I knew I wanted to come here after reading the reviews and it being inside the hotel we were staying. I made rsvps that day through OpenTable and it was a breeze!  So we take the elevator and walk over to the place and boy was it a simple walk to this place, especially for MGM being such a large property. Came to the hostess desk and waited 5 minutes to be seated. \n\n  We sat down and I immediately enjoyed the ambiance and feel of the place. Truman, our waiter was one of the best servers I've ever had! He was so nice and on point! We started with a bottle of sake and a mix drink.  The PIC and I scaled the menu and wanted to keep it light since he wanted to have the second half of our dinner somewhere else LOL.\n\n So we ordered the Hamachi jalapeno sashimi dish. That was deeeeelish! Very fresh fish and buttery! The main course we ordered was the short ribs with foie gras. OMG this dish was the best dish I ever had in 2012 so far! I could eat two of those! The short ribs were beyond moist and melt in your mouth. The foie gras, melted in my mouth! The whole dish was was tasty. The brown gravy they topped it with was like crack. I could eat a bowl of that brown sauce!  I miss that dish so bad! Especially since we can't dine on foie gras in Cali anymore :( For dessert, they gave me mochi for my Bday :)\n\n I will come  here EVERYTIME im in Vegas!!!!"

Lol also had the black cod... Absolutely delicious.. So sweet and soft mmmmm mmmm mmm!!! My boyfriend had the soft shell crab.. He said it was great! The sushi was okay needed to orders spicy mayo and eel sauce since the rolls were bland.. Fish was fresh though ... I would rather go with the black cod and shishito peppers"

            "review": "In search of good sushi, we walked up to Shibuya at 5:30pm and were luckily seated promptly without a reservation.  Having never visited before, we decided to try the Omakase tasting menu to experience the best Shibuya has to offer.  We were not disappointed!\n\nEvery course, in a smooth tempo, was excellent!  The standout dishes were the tuna tartare and scallops - both seasoned perfectly with that melt-in-your-mouth texture and calm but not muted flavors.\n\nThe entire experience, from first-rate service to top quality sushi bar and kitchen dishes was excellent!  The only weakness, if even much at all, was the lack of creativity in the flavors and dishes.  But, if you are looking for high quality Japanese fare without too much outside of the box extras, Shibuya seems to be a good, low-risk establishment that will deliver solid results."

There was also a stand out beef carpacio that was outstanding. \n\nI would give the restaurant a 5, but I felt the servings were on the small side for the price. \n\nStill - if you love Sushi and want a nice dinner with your date or friends this is a can't miss spot at the MGM Grand."

Shibuya is an incredibly beautiful and modern sushi restaurant with delicious food. It not only has a wide variety of sushi and sashimi plates, but a lot of hot entrees too, such as lobster and wagyu beef.\n\nIf this is your first time, suggest to start with a couple Sashimi plates and try some warm entrees. The is a full beer, cocktail and wine list ... pages and pages. The Hitachino beer and Orion are a couple of my fave light beers that pair well with sushi. The speciality cocktails with Asian ingredients like lychee and ginger are also a nice update to the average cocktail. \n\nShibuya and Nobu are the best Japanese restaurants in Vegas in my book."

            "review": "We ate at Shibuya our last night in Vegas over Super Bowl weekend.  The food and service here were outstanding, but I'd rate Shibuya just behind Nobu as far as Las Vegas strip sushi places go.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant is modern with an Asian flair.  The tables are divided by ornate ironwork in the dining area that gives you a sense of privacy - it was very cool.\n\nWe started dinner with a bottle of sake that was recommended by our waiter.  He asked what our price point was and what kind of flavor we were after and made a suggestion according to those criteria.  He didn't try to upsell us or belittle our amount - he was very professional.\n\nWe decided on a hybrid tasting menu - we gave the waiter a price point and told him to have the chef develop a menu for us based that amount of money for 3 people.  The chef came through with flying colors - the meal was fantastic!\n\nWe started with miso soup, edamame, seaweed salad, yellow tail sashimi and a tuna tartar.  The yellow tail was the highlight of this course as the fish was fresh and the jalepeno sauce on it was very tasty.  The next course was beef with dipping sauce and mushrooms, a tempura, and the lobster and scallop stew.  We loved the lobster stew - it was outstanding with its hints of saffron and was the highlight of the dinner.  The final course was sushi and sashimi that included 3 of the house rolls as well as yellow tail, salmon and tuna.  One roll that included eel and mango was our favorite - a great combination of flavors.\n\nThis meal was one of the highlights of our trip and we'll certainly be back again."

As we were seated at the table, she saw\nthe teppanyaki tables in the back and asked to be reseated there.\nThe servers immediately complied, however I kept my menu from the restaurant.\nOh so glad I did, as I ordered the hamachi with cherry tomato ponzu,and it was\nhonestly one of the best sashimi dishes I have ever had. The fish was perfect \nand the pungent yuzu and ponzu flavors combines with the cherry tomato \nsections and sauce was amazing, one of those things that you would not expect \nto go together so well but was perfectly symbiotic in a new and exciting way.\n\nNow before I continue on to the next part of the review which is the \nteppanyaki I have to explain first I am not a huge fan of teppanyaki as I \nprefer the flavors and foods over the show. Having worked in a teppanyaki \nplace for awhile its novelty has worn off on me, however I could not refuse \nthe woman on her birthday as she does like the show and when she realized \nthis place had teppanyaki she beelined over there. I did not remove any stars \nfor the teppanyaki as I would not have had the experience but for the \nsituation at hand. My stars are for the yellowtail dish and service only.\n\nThe chef came over pretty quickly after we ordered, just enough time to stock \nhis cart with our selections and travel over I would presume. He talked \nbriefly with us but as it was loud and his voice was quiet so he was hard to \nhear, then he put our choices on the flat top and quietly griddled away. \nA few comments and some time later he scooped up our food and served them to \neach of us. \nShe was very disappointed that there was no flair. \nI was disappointed in a $95 rib eye griddled in soy sauce..\n\nI wish I would have been able to choose restaurant selections, although they \ndid allow me to order from the restaurant even from the teppanyaki tables and \nthey served it to me there as well, no questions asked. I will definitely be \nback although it was $500 for the four of us for dinner with drinks. I hope \nnext time I am here I can find another culinary gem that will change my mind \nabout food in a subtle way, but until then I will be saving up for our next \ntrip here."

There were a ton of entree options like chicken, fish, beef, veggies, pork, etc... But I picked the catch of the day.\n\n+ Miso soup: average. how can you go wrong with this?\n+ Salad: don't really know what kind it was, but it was great! It was perfectly dressed, perfectly sized... loved it!\n+ Sushi: two pieces of mini sushi with mixed fish & veggies\n+ Entree: The catch of the day was sea bass and after the awesome sea bass I had at my cousin's wedding the week before in the Bay Area, I wanted more. IT WAS SO AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. Soft fish, but was still able to hold it's shape. Slightly sweet meat.... oh my goodness. SO GOOD! It was served with veggies and garlic\n+ Rice: Choice of fried rice or plain. I got plain because I don't eat rice often. I literally eat like 1/8 cup of rice everytime I do, so I didn't want to waste the chef's effort to make the fried rice.\n+ Dessert: 3 types: raspberry mousse, chocolate lychee and mochi. i had a little bit of everything because i was so full. the mochi was standard but the other two were... interesting. \n\nFor the teppanyaki part... not much of a show. They cooked the entree, veggies, and fried rice (for those that ordered it) on the grill... but that's about it. It wasn't much of a show.. Honestly the teppanyaki i had in Jamaica was more entertaining... haha but this place gets 4 stars because of the awesome sea bass. yummmmm"

Since I never really liked it, it was irrelevant what I ordered and to give you an idea of the experiences, I ordered uni one evening and the waitress asked \"you like that\" with a disgusted face.  I replied with \"I don't know, I've never had it\".  She delivered it and it was a black slimy mess and tasted equally rancid.  Apparently, the waitress never had good sushi either.\n\nMy girlfriend, now wife, insisted that I at least try good sushi before I write it off.  Shibuya was what turned me into a believer.  I tried uni and watched them cut it fresh.  What a difference!  I sampled their sake too and it was good.  The thing that I've learned since is that you do get what you pay for when it comes to sushi and sake.  Since we've found good local sushi but nothing that compares to Shibuya.\n\nIf you like sushi, visit Shibuya.  It's fantastic."

The tasting menu is a 4-courses meal in addition to complimentary edamame. Everything we ate was fantastic except for the spicy tuna roll - pretty much basic which you can get anywhere else. My duo fish entree literally metled in the mouth - nicely flavored with miso sauce and it was prettily presented. The best fish i've ever eaten at a restaurant - so moist and cooked just right. I think the secret ingredients for the night was tangerine peels. It's very subtle in all of the dishes but I can detect the freshness of the rind which was wonderful. Well, I guess it was aptly used for their SUMMER menu after all."

Nobu seemed like the obvious choice at first for expensive and great sushi, but quite frankly the strip had dominated my physical abilities. The heat and just everything. Considering we had already made our way over to the MGM for the David Copperfield show it seemed to make sense to give this place a shot due to proximity and conveniency. Low-and-behold we could never imagined what we were in-store for.\n\nI ordered two pieces of uni (Sea Urchin) and two pieces of Ikura (Salmon Roe). Both tasted fresh, salty and amazing!\n\nNext was onto my first roll, the Haku Ryu. It was a delectable treat of Cucumber, White and Green Asparagus Inside Topped with Torched Anago, Brie Cheese and Eel Sauce. To say the least it melted in my mouth. The brie was such a unique addition. \n\nWith my belly ALMOST full, I decided it was too good so far and wasn't time to quit. Next up was the Mifune or Spider Roll. Now let's just say I've had my share of spider rolls, but this one would take 1st prize at any spider roll competition across the USA!!!!!!\n\n\nA simple concoction of Soft Shell Crab, Tobiko, Scallion, Daikon. The ingrediants came together with precision.\n\nLast was the KINACO TIRAMISU. A combination of Espresso Coffee, Kuromitsu Syrup, Kinaco Ice Cream, and Cappuccino Foam. This was literally to die for.\n\n\nAll in all 5 stars across the board. The service was superb, the ambiance was creative and the food was spectacular. My next trip to Vegas will require a night of sushi back at Shibuya!!!!"

            "review": "After night after night of sub-par food in Vegas, we wondered if it was worth it to shell out the cash for a 5-star restaurant on our last night there. We did. Was it worth it? Well, I'd say yes. After my four-night stay in Vegas, the one thing I learned was to have low expectations. 4-star means 3-star, and as it follows, 5-star means 4-star. Prices are inflated, and you can't get around it unless you leave the prison known as The Strip. So while I've had better and cheaper Japanese food in various other cities, Shibuya still served me the best meal of my trip, and for that I was satisfied.\n\nWe started with a few different maki, and they were just average. Kampachi sashimi with yuzu and truffle oil was mouthwateringly amazing. I wish I would have ordered two! Next was the Kurobata Pork Crisp, which was like a BBQ pork and tofu maki (sort of). It was delicious but a tad too heavy, I could have done with half the portion. And definitely make room for dessert! I got the creme brulee duo and tried a few others among our group. Everything was great, and the presentations were beautiful.\n\nService here was also the best of my stay. Our waiter was super friendly, knowledgeable, and even persuaded me to change my menu choice by offering me a free shot of sake to complement the Kampachi. Overall, while it wasn't the best restaurant I've ever visited, it was a great experience, and I'd recommend Shibuya to anyone looking for good high-end Japanese in Vegas."

Not the cheapest sushi in town but definitely some of the best.\nIf your into sushi and happen to be at the MGM do yourself a favor and stop by. Its a beautiful place and service was top notch\nI would love to go back again!"

They have an expansive menu of family style dishes. Everything is pricey, which is to be expected in Vegas, but I did not feel that the quality of the food was worth the money. We spent about $150.00 on a dinner for two that left us both still hungry. I have dined at other Japanese restaurants within the MGM that have had better food at half the price. I don't think I will be dining here again."

            "review": "Another night done right! \nI came to LV to celebrate a friends birthday and I had been recently studying a lot about the vegas architecture before my visit. Since Shibuya was 1) sushi and 2) within walking distance from our hotel room. It was really my 1st decision to  come eat here. I knew ahead of time that my visit here would be expensive. I ordered everything I wanted but was upset that I had not grabbed enough cash- (Mistake)\n\nI'm not a cash conservative but when drunk I like playing with cash more and not plastic for (obvious reasons). \n\nanyway: My table of friends could not all chalk up to spending what would cost us a pair of shoes and for that the visit was slightly awkward. Although, it did not stop me from enjoying my food and my experience. The ambiance is amazing, the sparkling changing overhead when you first enter and the space usage of their restaurant.  It looks big but it's not it's average size spaced proportionally to make the restaurant appear large. I wasn't a fan of the rock solid seating they had or the dark lighting which seemed to be a theme for vegas hotel restaurants. (Romantic \"creepy\") our waiter on the other hand fell a bit short. and something I'm use to with service these days. \n\nOur waiter never told us how much add ons were if we could not find it on the menu. (he also) cleverly had a dear friend order something she assumed would be least expensive, which turned out to be the most expensive item on our bill. Oh he was dirty! but none the less....\n\nI'll be back shibuya with my plastic friend!!! Everything about you is perfection! xo"

The food was good...loved the sushi, loved the cocktails _ I had a sparkling saki with cucumber & cranberry- very refreshing and summery....(2 adult beverages... not 2 each ) and my hubby & brother loved the beer (2 beers...also not 2 each).  We all  loved the food. ..however I did feel that over $800 for dinner was a bit more than a treat....especially since we had 2 kids with us.    \n\n\nThe service was very good, the teppanyaki chef was just ok as far as being entertaining, the food was tasty & the portions generous....may be too much so as taking food home when you are on vacation seldom works out because you don't have a way to store or heat it up later.  \n\nHubby had the lobster & striploin...he loved it; I had the scallops and crab legs, which were very yummy, my brother had the swordfish & striploin, he especially love the striploin, sis in law had crab legs, and my neices had a combo of striploin, chicken & shrimp...all of which were great.  The fried rice upcharges were quite high, $20 for meat, and $14 for any other fried rice.  On the upside deserrt was included in our tab...we had a trio of treats...the dessert was ok...but not liked by the kids as they were contained very strong raspberry, and dark chocolate adult type flavors.    We had so much left over food that had to be left behind as we were staying at a hotel not a time share with a kitchenette.  The food was excellent but in my humble opinion I have had almost as good at many a small establishment closer to home for less than half the price.  Not sure I'll go back, even though the food was excellent I still I found this place overpriced ...and yes I am use to Vegas prices."

Looking over the menu, I was pretty excited about all of the interesting dishes and great ingredients. Immediately, the Iberico pork dish jumped out at me. And the chef selection sashimi. Expensive, sure, but I was looking for a \"WOW\" kind of dinner. Especially after seeing all the 5 star reviews. \n\nI got a wow dinner, but it was more like a, \"Wow, what the heck was that?\". I have had Iberico ham and it is amazing. This was not that. If it was, they found a way to screw it up. As for the Sashimi, have a look at the picture http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shibuya-las-vegas?select=GB9jv39b835AEE5NeLH9jA#GB9jv39b835AEE5NeLH9jA \nThis is the chef selection sashimi...why is there unagi and regular old shrimp? And a questionable scallop? And what is arguably imitation crab meat?  \n\nOne might say I came here on an off night. No dice. Just watching how they prepare the food and how it is stored, I can tell this is the norm. To be honest, I didn't try the rolls so maybe that is more their speed. But when you put chef selection sashimi and Iberico ham on the menu - it should be top notch. \n\nBy the way, just to put this in perspective. Add a decent small bottle of sake and a beer, with tip...$180. Disappointing to say the least."

Not really.   But because you are in vegas you have to try it for one time.  \n\n\nAMBIENCE:   Setting here is very fine dining experience which is really nice.  Their lighting and decor is very modern and unique.\n\n\nSERVICE:  We had a mexican waiter (forgot his name) but he didn't seem to care much about us throughout the whole dinner.  He was like a \"whatever type of waiter\".   He mostly wanders off to other tables leaving us always looking around for him just to ask for chopsticks and more ginger.   To me I think that is really horrible service.  You should treat every customer whether they came in dressy or not with the SAME service; but for us it wasn't anything like that. \n\n\nFOOD:  SASHIMI SALAD: Tuna, Salmon, and White Fish Tataki, Organic Field Greens, Sesame Miso Vinaigrette.   This salad was really good with fresh greens and a zesty vinaigrette. \n----We also order spicy tuna roll and some other specialty roll which I had forgotten the name. \n\n\nDESSERT: KINACO TIRAMISU: Espresso Coffee, Kuromitsu Syrup, Kinaco Ice Cream, Cappuccino Foam.  \n\n\nOverall, I give this place a 3 star because of the poor service there.  Food was good, price was managable ( a little pricy).  I can still get the same food elsewhere with better and nicer service and reasonable price.   Enjoy!"

When we showed up they congratulated us without us saying a word. The Signature obviously clued them in!\n\nThey sat us in a secluded spot [as much as they could in the bustling restaurant] and were very attentive.\n\nMy husband and I are in love with Japanese food. This place just blew us away. We are Australian and tried the Australian Crab Miso Soup. Fabulous... it had fresh mushrooms and a kick of spice in it which made it the best I have ever had. The presentation was beautiful.\n\nWe tried a $65 bottle of Sake which was amazing. I am a sucker for high quality sake. \n\nWe also were given a tiramisu with a large flake of white chocolate inscribed with 'congratulations' ... i will post a photo in time.\n\nIt was the best dining experience of our lives. Such detail and care went into our experience. Although it was pricey, it was worth every cent. We arent usually people to gamble our money on an unknown restaurant, but this was so pleasurable I truly recommend it to anyone!"

I had 3 rolls, all of which seemed to be wrapped in cabbage (where's the damned seaweed?!), which didn't make them very appetizing.  Service was good, and there's a giant (I'm talking a 3 x 3 grid of 50\" plasma's) displaying some funky color pattern as you walk in, with translucent boxes at varying heights which looks even more funky at an angle (not head on)."

They basically give you a live lobster head so that it is still twitching at your table, and feed you the fresh sashimi slices. OMG IT IS THE BEST!! To not waste the rest of the lobster, they serve it to you battered up and tempura style, and then a soup. Delicious!! But very expensive, I believe it will cost you $260 just for that. The decor is beautiful and the sea bass and lobster salad are 2 other notable dishes. Extraordinary cuisine at MGM."

Initially we had great service as we were seated by a friendly hostess immediately (had reservations), but downhill service-wise from there.\n\nAs far as the food.  it was pretty standard sushi bar fare.  One person ordered a hot seafood dish, and this came to the table 15 minutes before any of the sushi, so the one person who ordered this as an entree was forced to eat while we all watched. *awkward*  The rolls were pretty standard.  Nothing stood out.  Not a great sign at a sushi restaurant since the number one way to tell a great sushi restaurant from a mediocre one is the variety and quality of rolls.  We will likely choose other restaurants for sushi during upcoming visits this year as platinum M Life members.\n\nCheers."

Remarkable.\n\nShibuya deserves the special adjectives you reserve for that one experience, that one moment, when you realize that you've just obtained a memory that you will never, ever forget. \n\nAfter a 6-hour drive to Vegas on the rainiest, coldest day ever (it was hailing in Barstow - seriously), we dropped our luggage off at our hotel and walked over to MGM to grab a bite. We almost went for Michael Mina's Nobhill Tavern, but an illuminating establishment across from his restaurant caught our eye: http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/hV_RARo0AHGIbuGAn6rwGw/l. Considering that Japanese is my favorite cuisine and Shibuya received a AAA Four-Diamond award, we decided to check it out.\n\nAfter a short wait, we were seated at a cozy corner table. The entire staff was pleasant, from the hostess, to the busboy, to our waiter. Every move they made was thoughtful and seamless, making us truly feel like their most important guests of the night.  I'm sure they treat everyone this way, but it felt so personal. LA restaurants can learn a thing or two about service; In Vegas, they know you're there to have a good time and do whatever it takes to keep you entertained. In LA, the wait staff act as if they're too good to serve you. At Shibuya, their grace made us actually feel lucky to be served by them.\n\nWe had the option of ordering prix fixe, but we opted to order from the main menu. We ordered the edamame to start, which was warm, soft, lightly salted, and delicious. A nice teaser. Sushi could happen any night, so we decided to try their cold and warm plates. For our first course, Vlad ordered the Kani Salad (King Crab, Snow Crab and Dungeness Crab with Lotus Chips) and I ordered the Maine Lobster Salad (Japanese Vegetables, Ginger Shiso Vinegar and Crispy Rice Net). The presentation was breathtaking, with a taste to match: http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/VNH9oFM0A9-XCJZRAVVHxg/l. YES that's a fish bowl under the Kani Salad! We didn't eat the fish of course, but enjoyed his company. My salad came with an abundance of lobster pieces, as well as a nice big piece on the side of the plate. It was the best lobster I've ever tasted, hands down. \n\nFor our warm plates, Vlad ordered the Kurobuta Pork Crisp (Braised Black Pork in Brick Leaf Seared Tofu and Nihon Glaze) and I ordered the Salmon and Black Cod (Pineapple Miso Marinated Salmon and Shiro Miso Broiled Black Cod). Another brilliant presentation: http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/1b1_o_5fxypp6IjpsBgnhQ/l. Vlad said the pork melted in his mouth. He was a happy boy. The pineapple marinade on the salmon had the perfect amount of sweetness without phasing out the salmon taste. It came with a slice of dried pineapple too - yum. The black cod was soft and melted in my mouth as well. Cloud nine.\n\nDessert was Choco Lychee (Chocolate Mousse Cake, Lychee Vanilla Jelly, Chocolate Soy Milk Ice Cream): http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/EiIMhxCGee2Kbrkj9sj0SQ/l. Being lactose-intolerant, we both appreciated that all the ice creams on the menu came in soy.  The mousse was light and sweet and the ice cream was soooo gooooood.\n\nOver dinner we could have been talking about what we were going to do for the rest of the night, how crappy the drive was, or where we should go the next day, but instead all we could do was talk about how amazing this dinner was. We realized that this experience was our reward for the hell we went through to get there. We also realized that we would go through hell again just to receive this reward.\n\nShibuya, there's nothing like you.\n\n\n\nI think I just wrote my first love letter to a restaurant."

My experiences with other restaurants there (Seablue, Wolfgang Puck) led me to anticipate an awesome experience. Instead, it was a huge disappointment.\n\nThe restaurant itself is nicely laid out with plenty of tables and a long sushi bar, as well as a teppanyaki (steakhouse) area. It is very attractive with an Asian-influenced contemporary decor. We visited the restaurant on a Friday evening, and because one member of our party was not a big sushi fan, we opted to sit in the teppanyaki area. Although you are ordering from the steakhouse menu, you can also order selections from the sushi bar.\n\nThe restaurant was fairly busy except for the teppanyaki area--this should have been our first clue that something was amiss. The service in this section can be generously described as \"leisurely\" -- there really was a lack of attention. The waiter forgot our drink orders, made mistakes on the sushi items we ordered (although did offer to fix them) and forgot to serve our rice (burnt) until our meal was half-completed. One nit-pick: the sweaty bus boys were clothed in t-shirts and dirty aprons. For the level of service billed, I find this to be totally inappropriate--they should have been wearing a vest or jacket of some sort.\n\nThis leads me to my next complaint. We had the worst teppanyaki chef I have ever seen in my life. In my opinion, teppanyaki is an art. The chef needs to be friendly, entertaining and interact with his patrons. There was absolutely no \"show\" at all (knife skills, food acrobatics, etc.) that characterizes a true teppanyaki restaurant. The chef's interaction with our party was limited to a few mumbled words. The chefs should be Japanese, although it isn't absolutely necessary, but does enhance the experience. Finally, the food portions were microscopic--disappointing given the prices charged. Generally speaking, food cost is just a tiny portion of the overall restaurant overhead, labor comprising the majority. They could have at least offered a decent-sized portion.\n\nWe only ordered a few sushi items so I don't know if I can fairly assess the sushi bar. I found the maki to be completely unremarkable and I could probably order as good or better rolls at my neighborhood sushi-ya. The hamachi (yellowtail) didn't taste as fresh as what I had in the yellowtail crudo at Seablue. Freshness is absolutely essential for a successful sushi restaurant.\n\nI suppose this review seems harsh, but the restaurant displays the AAA Four Diamond award at the front of the house, and I expect far more for Four Diamonds that what we received. We spent over $300 for three people, and was totally unimpressed by this restaurant. Perhaps the sushi bar is much better, but I don't think I'd risk another bad and high-priced adventure here. There must be better options for sushi in Las Vegas, and there are definitely better options for dining at the MGM Grand than Shibuya. [Update: See my review for Ichiza in Las Vegas, a great off-Strip Japanese restaurant.]"

If I could give this place no stars I would.\n\nI told the waiter that it was my bachelorette party and asked if he had any suggestions.  He said he didn't. Even though we found out later that they had a tasting menu.  This would be nice to offer a bachelorette party.  We asked him what was on the boat and he couldn't really tell us and said he would check with the chef.  He came back about 10minutes later and told us he couldn't understand what the sushi chefs were saying because they didn't speak English very well.  Are you kidding me???  You should NOT be working in a Japanese restaurant if you cannot communicate with the sushi chefs.  Telling a bunch of Asians that your chef cannot speak English is bordering on being racist.  Why don't you try a little harder next time since this IS your job.\n\nHe was barely present through out our whole meal and I was so upset that I called the manager over.  The manager was useless.  He did not see what the waiter did wrong (maybe he was racist as well) and did not offer to do anything extra for us.  \n\nWhen the bill came, I tried to paid it with my credit card.  The scumbag waiter came back and told me that my card was declined.  How embarrassed did  he make me feel.  I found out later when I called my credit card that it was NEVER declined.  What a scumbag.  He was doing it out of spite.\n\nThis is the worse restaurant I have ever dined at.  The food doesn't even matter because the service was so horrible.  If Shibuya was in NYC, it would not stand a chance because New Yorkers will not put up with this type of subpar service at a fine dining establishment.  There are tons of restaurants in Vegas and this one is not worth your aggrevation."

We wanted to go to L' Atelier or Craftsteak but could not get a reservation so we ended up here. Our first time was in Jan. 2007 and ordered from the traditional menu. Don't remember much from that meal but I know it was quite good. This time we had Teppanyaki. Didn't have any expectations but we were blown away. By far the best Teppanyaki we've ever had. However, if you're looking for one with a Teppanyaki show (such as that at Benihana's), this is definitely not the place.  \n\nOur dinner: an amuse bouche (crab salad), the organic field greens w/ apple yuzu vinaigrette, soup (lobster and mushroom miso) main course ( Day Boat Scallops, Salmon-Sustainable Catch, Ribeye, Tenderloin) with dipping sauces trio (ponzu, ginge miso, garlic aioli), Organic Vegetables and Tamaki Rice. Everything was fresh, flavorful and cooked to perfection. We ended the meal with a dessert trio of mango mochi ice cream, choco lychee mouse and panna cotta w/ raspberry coulis. Loved it! \n\nThey have an extensive sake and cocktail list but we're too tired from our day trip to the Grand Canyon so we didn't have any.\n\nFrom the beautiful setting to great food, I would recommend this restaurant. However, I only gave it 4 stars because we weren't too crazy about the service. The Hostess were friendly, the Teppanyaki Chef was good, but our main server was abrupt. I even asked if we can order some items from the traditional menu and he quickly replied no, but we saw the lady at the next table who clearly was eating something off the regular menu."

I already get it from my family and friends, and I don't need the Yelp community joining in. - I'm working on it).  To celebrate, we had a nice dinner at this restaurant by ordering the Dinner for Two selection.\n\nBear in mind this is an $80 per person meal, but most definitely falls under the \"You get what you pay for\"  in the most positive sense.\n\nThe meal is wonderful.  Fresh cuts of fish (we ordered steak as one of the seven courses) that are just amazing.  We had a crab salad that had a sectioned bowl with a beautiful live fish swimming around the bottom of it (don't worry, it's decorative, and does not interact with the actual food).  It's the sort of meal that you would feel horrible rush eating because everything is cooked and seasoned to perfection, and don't want to see the experience end.\n\nWe also did the sake flight plan, with four wonderful sake flavors.  A nice gentleman came out, placed cards with the names and descriptions of each flavor, then gave us a brief history of each type.  Each flavor varied in taste, and left us feeling warm after the experience.\n\nFor desert, a friend messaged me that we must try their Star Rabbit blueberry sake.  I'm recommending the same here.  It is an amazing desert drink.\n\nThe staff, upon finding out that it was our fifth anniversary, surprised us with complementary glasses of champagne and a second desert.  A perfect capper to an already fantastic experience.  The service was top notch overall.  Very attentive, and never rushed a single thing.\n\nWhile I'm sure the sake helped, I was \"food drunk\" from the meal selection, but oh so very happy.  While Shibuya may not be an everyday meal sort of thing, when used as a special occasion dining experience, it really becomes its own event."

Miso black cod was beautifully cooked. The sashimi was fresh and had a delightful selection, though the price was slightly high $55 for 9 pieces of sashimi. \n\nWe decided to come back here a second time to try the omakase meal which seems decently priced at $135/pax.\n\nAmuse bouche was kusshi oysters - Yumm.\n\nToro tartare with caviar and karashi soy - Enjoyed the toro tartare very much, though the caviar did little to enhance the dish. Probably could have done without it.\n\nKanpachi sashimi with miso dust, yuzu and truffle essence - Different, but refreshing. Liked it.\n\nLobster and Foie gras terrine with Lobster salad with citrus soy vinaigrette - The lobster salad was awesome. Would love to have more of that. The foie gras terrine was good too, tasted very buttery, but I felt that the lobster in the terrine was a little off. The foie gras flavor was too overpowering and covered the sweetness of the lobster. The cold lobster was hard and chewy and was weird since the terrine melts in your mouth. The contrast was just too strong and unfortunately didnt work.\n\nPan roasted hokkaido scallop in uni butter sauce - Scallop was beautifully cooked (on one side). Uni butter sauce was so good we contemplated getting a spoon to drink it all up.\n\nAustralian wagyu skirt in pepper teriyaki - Super good. Beef was tender and perfectly cooked. \n\nChef's choice sushi - We were given, salmon, tuna, halibut and yellowtail. I would have expected slightly rarer sashimi, but this was good. The freshly grated wasabi did the job :)\n\nDessert tasting - Jasmine animitsu was a little off, sweet but bitter at the same time. I'd pass. The choco-lychee mousse cake was delightful, so was the mochi ice cream.\n\nOverall food quality was okay. For $135/pax in Vegas, I'd say it was a comfortable price point too. Nonetheless, service was rather disappointing. Our plates were cleared without being asked. Tea pot was not refilled promptly. Even upon refilling, the server didnt bother to top up our tea cups. Plates were served with a loud \"clang\" on the table. Server was reciting the dish wrong. Also, they didnt have a consistent server and each dish seems to be served up by a different waiter, which leads to the inconsistency in service.\n\n3.5 stars overall. -0.5 for subpar service."

When you look around and the great majority of the other diners there are indeed Japanese of course! This place fit the bill. We started the night with a bottle of Schlossgut Diel a perfect Riesling that paired well with seafood but had enough structure and backbone to pair with beef. Up first...Shibuya Roll, a soft shell crab roll cooked wonderfully. But the better sushi piece was the Oh Toro Nigiri. This was made with the fatty belly of the tuna, and it was this awesome buttery texture that was excellent. We then went to another round of Oyster tasting that were done in several different preparations. For the 3rd and final round we opted for a hot mushroom salad and the then sprang for the star of the night, A5 Japanese Wagyu Beef. Wonderful, soft, melt in your mouth texture that was some of the best beef I have ever tasted. The hype surrounding this beef is spot on! It is something you have to put on your culinary bucket list. Unfortunately, at $40 per ounce you can't really have an awful lot of it unless you want to take out a small low interest loan. Fortunately, a little of it goes a long way. \nSo be warned, the bill for this dinner was $362.00 for 2 people so its certainly pricey, but it is definitely worth it. If you ever find yourself in the MGM Grand Hotel in Vegas you certainly have to give it a try."

I'm the first to admit I'm spoiled by the sushi scene in Los Angeles, and I imagine this could be a swanky spot for an out of towner, but it's just not good. The prices are ridiculous considering portion size (4 half shell oysters for $17?) and the taste is nothing spectacular. The reason this is 2 stars instead of 1 is that the presentation was very nice. But there are many Japanese options on the strip and I would recommend going elsewhere for a seafood fix."

            "review": "Really good dinner tonight. I followed the recommendation of the waiter, to an extent, and probably ordered more than I needed, but, what the hey. \n\nI started with the sunomono, just plain. Really nice, ice cold (but not icy) cucumbers with a sweet vinegar dressing and toasted black sesame seeds. Delicious, crisp, refreshing. Maybe a little bit too sweet, and maybe could have used a little bit more sesame seed, but really a nice start. \n\nI ordered both a roll and a hot plate - the roll was the waiter recommended Shibuya Roll. Soft shell crab, fresh jalapeno, spicy albacore, and scallion. Very good, even with the scallion on top. The crab was nice and sweet, with a very light batter, and the jalapeno, although odd sounding, provided good heat that really wasn't all too different from what you get in your typical spicy tuna roll. I would tend to blame that on the quality of the pepper - either it's lost in the roll, or it didn't have much jalapeno flavor, just a little mild heat. Either way, this was worth getting, even as I was drawn to the Hanabi roll with its green apple. \n\nThe entree was the also recommended Australian lobster and day boat scallops in uni butter sauce. This was simply outstanding. Sweet, succulent, delicious lobster, as close to what I remember having at Tru, and very well cooked scallops (of which only one was the tiniest bit gritty), all in a delicious, and likely heart healthy sauce. All of this was on a little rice, and with edamame, baby carrot, and heirloom cherry tomatoes, which were pleasantly cooked hot, but still crisp skinned. All of this was just an amazing combo. I found myself expending the effort to chopstick individual grains of rice out of the leftover sauce. \n\nAs I was dining alone (really fun, I know) I opted to sit at the sushi bar, which is one of the better ones I've sat at. Probably 5-6 chefs, all working what simply beautiful ingredients, and making some really amazing stuff. It would take a lot of visits to try all the things they were making, but that I didn't order. Service was friendly and prompt - I was even seated a bit early, and the place was definitely not empty. I probably won't be back? But I would totally go back."

I had an appetizer of lobster miso soup and although you really couldn't taste much of the lobster the chunks were in there, but the soup itself was very delicious. Entree was a mixture of scallop and lobster bisque and that was simply incredible.\n\n Everything was prepared to perfection and I think I even ate the decoration. My boyfriend had shrimp tempura which he loved, sister had a seafood salad and her boyfriend had this amazing pork roll dish. Everyone was in awe at the deliciousness of their food. We had enough room for the dessert and it hit the spot. \n\nI can see some complaining about portion size, and yes they were fairly small but honestly once we ate we didn't have that overstuffed-I-need-to-pass-out-this-very-instant feeling. It was just right and allowed us to continue on with our night without being dragged down by the food.\n\nWe had two appetizers, four entrees and four desserts + drinks and our bill was $175 excluding tip. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is not on a tight budget."

She did a little research and found this place. \n\nWe were able to make last minute reservations (around 7:30pm) for 10:00pm. \n\nWalking in to this MGM Grand restaurant, you know immediately it's a pretty upscale environment. The host and hostess were dressed professionally to the T's. They were very warm and welcoming. \n\nOnce seated, we were greeted again by a very nice waiter. He went over the hibachi menu with us in very fine detail. \n\nI decided on the Jidori chicken breast and Hokkaido scallop combination. My wife chose the catch of the day which she was told was salmon. When the meats were brought out before they were supposed to be prepared on the grill, it was a striped sea bass. She was expecting salmon and when she spoke to the waiters, he said the other waiter who told us that was mistaken. However, in fine quality dining service fashion, the waiter and chef found her some salmon and allowed her to try the striped sea bass at no additional charge. Interestingly enough, she enjoyed the sea bass more. \n\nAll of our sea food and chicken was delicious. Very well seasoned. Tasty as all! Here at Shibuya, the chef told us that unlike Benihanas they serve the entree first so you don't get full off of rice and vegetables first. That's a good way to do it. But everything was fab. \n\nAnother high point was that we ordered white rice and the couple next to us ordered fried rice. But to our delight the chef cooked too much and allowed us a whole. We were a bit disappointed that we didn't choose fried rice first, but our sample portion was nearly as large as our original. \n\nWhen you come to Shibuya you're going to spend. But you're going to be happy about where every red penny went. Definitely coming back the next time I'm in Vegas."

We did it Omakase style, where he put together a menu for us and made sake suggestions. \n\nSince it was omakase I don't remember all the details of the dishes but everything served was delicious and beautifully plated. \n\nWe started with a sparkling sake... then a special tofu dish that came out in a dry ice pond and was too pretty eat, but so tasty we demolished the piece of art.... yellowtail carpaccio and I think it was lightly seared tuna with fried shallots... The fish was all fresh and delish. The yellowtail was soft and buttery :)\n\nThen we got a 3 crab seaweed salad which came beautifully again plated, in a cup sitting on top of a small fish bowl with a beta fish inside... that was followed by a searched kobe with mushrooms yuuuuummy!... then a dual plated fish dishe, one of salmon cooked just right and a little pink inside, and a buttery chilean sea bass that was melt in your mouth... then we had a kurabuto pork roll, which is like stewed or braised port, mixed with some mushroom I think, rolled and fried like an egg roll but it was not greasy and was juicy and crunchy. The pork as sooo flavorful and tender, yuuuummy!...  \n\nWe had brought a special bottle of sake with us (courtesy of a good friend who just got back from Japan, ty). Jeff knew exactly when to serve us the sake to go with our dishes.\n\nFollowing that, some at our table made a special order of a premium cut of special kobe, that was presented like 2 pieces of nigiri (and though I don't like to mention prices, I have to say those 2pieces were $50... i didn't get it... though I'm regretting that decision as i'm writing this now)... \n\nThen... more... he brought out a place of assorted sushi rolls and nigiri (salmon, halibut, toro, yellow tail, shrimp, and 3 specialty rolls)... \n\nWe eventually finished with a some in house made green tea mochi and 2 creme brules (plum and miso flavored).\n\nEverything we had was good. All well prepared. If I were to specifically note, the least special dish of the night was a salmon, but only b/c you can probably find that sort of preparation in most generally decent Japanese restaurants, and my favorite was probably the yellowtail carpaccio, because the quality of the fish was sooo good.\n\nIn addition the decor of the restaurant was beautiful and relaxing. The service was prompt and everyone very friendly. Jeff was definately knowledgeable and I'm confident that other server there just as good. Their sake list was pretty extensive, and overall they are a little on the pricey side, but well worth it if you want some good food."

Could it be we didn't spend as much money this time?\n\nIt seemed as though once our server knew we weren't interested in the expensive Omakase menu, and just wanted a few simple ala carte items, he lost complete interest in our table.  He couldn't get away from the table fast enough actually.  Plates were dropped off  rapidly, and he repeatedly bolted away.  I was really disappointed as our last meal here had been thoroughly excellent.\n\nThe food was still fantastic, if not priced somewhat over the top, as all things Las Vegas.  Our sushi came out exceptionally quickly, I noted they had at least four sushi chefs working.  All the rolls were excellent quality, fine construction and ingredients.  \n\nFive for food, four for a great dining space and atmosphere, one for an almost comically disinterested server.\n\nWith all the Vegas options for high end Japanese, I doubt I'd come back here intentionally.  Perhaps for the sushi bar, as that did look pretty cool, and I could be sure to avoid the completely bi-polar service."

Some of the dishes were larger than what you'd expect from a tasting menu so, by the end of the meal, not only were our taste buds sated, so was our appetite.

I think the restaurant is beautiful and clean. Very modern. Bigger than it looks from outside. \nI was excited when we sat down at the table for the chef to come out and do his show while preparing our dinner. \nMy husband ordered a Japanese beer and loved how cold it was. I was initially impressed with the server and server assistant coming to welcome us and introduce themselves. I felt overwhelmed when the manager introduced them self immediately following. Then one minute later the server came back to take our order. I hadn't even gotten to look yet. \nThey gave us more time. Everytime I looked around and the place our server would come over and ask what I needed. I thought it was great that we were never left without service in the beginning. But that didn't last the duration of our visit. \nMy husband would have easily bought 2 more beers but the server didn't bring the third one he asked for. Then never offered or asked again. Easy sale lost on their part. \nThe prices are high so I had an expectation that this cook was going to be phenomenal. We have sho gun and benihana in San Diego where we live. So we aren't strangers to the fun show they provide while cooking. \nUnfortunately we were extremely dissapointed with this portion of the visit. I am glad I ordered the $54 chicken rather than the $98 steak or I would have felt even more ripped off. \nOur cook mumbled and hardly spoke English. I feel like that is important to be able to speak a little for that job. His tricks were terrible. He made the saddest heart I've ever seen. The bottom was flat. It was embarrassing. \nHe tried to do the pac man trick and it was so terrible we tried not to laugh. \nHe burnt the fried rice while he was trying to make shapes and words out of it. Then he continued to burn it even longer while he spelled tlc. Not sure what the point of that was?\nThe food was ok. The mushroom soup was not good. The salad was dry and kinda glad because that dressing wasn't very good. The chicken was good. But for 50 dollar chicken it should be better than good. \nMy husbands food was ok too. They gave us the rive 10 mins before our meat was cooked. Then it was another 20 mins till he cooked the vegetables. I tried to eat really slow while I waited. But it didn't work out. Then my rice was hard and cold. My chicken was gone. Timing is everything. This needs some massive work. If the timing had at least been good then the show and tricks wouldn't have been a big deal. But he couldn't manage either. Also I suggest not cooking all the meats so close together. And wiping off the spatula between touching. I do not like fish at all. So I was disgusted by lobster and scallops being cooked touching my chicken.\n\n So we were really dissapointed that we spent so much money and time at shibuya. I hope that management sees this and contacts me. I will be back in January. Will we go to shibuya again? Not after what we experienced. \n\nThey sent out a desert with our meal. I only tried the chocolate covered ice cream thing. The middle was good. The outside felt like panty hose in my mouth. I had to spit it out. \nBest thing about this place? They have incredibly soft linens."

When the bus boy brought the water, he poured it directly on the table at first, completely missing my glass, and then just mumbled \"sorry\" and walked away...With the waiter nowhere in sight, we had to wipe the water ourselves before it dripped over the edge of the table.

We started off with the salmon poke and crispy rice with tuna cold dishes. They were probably my favorite part of the meal because the flavors were so rich and the fish were prepared beautifully. Next we got the Black Cod Miso, Rock Shrimp Tempura, and Hamachi Kama (Yellowtail) warm plates. The fish was tender, flaky, and flavorful. I would highly recommend all of them! I guess we were still craving one last thing at that point so we ordered the Shibuya roll which comes with soft-shell crab, jalapeno, spicy albacore, and scallions. The crab and jalapeno added so much flavor and texture, which only made it better. \n\nI was in Vegas for Christmas with my family, but also to celebrate my birthday! Prince came back with two portions of Shibuya's birthday ice cream mochis and topped off a wonderful meal. Service, quality, and ambiance earns Shibuya a solid 5 stars."

It was spectacular, and just for that dish alone I am glad we came here for dinner! So, 3 stars it gets. However, their incredibly slow, indifferent and spotty service, just OK sushi and meager portions deserve nothing but 2. I have no issue with paying big bucks for an amazing dish, but don't make me wait 10 minutes for a menu and then serve me a four bite main course and tell me that is meant to be \"shared\". The proprietor of this restaurant has much to learn from the many fine establishments on the Vegas Strip."

            "review": "This is the best sushi I've ever had. Easily.\n\nThe prices reflect the high quality of the fish that is flown in daily. S'not cheap, but it is however: worth it.\n\nShibuya is located at the start of the Studio Walk inside the MGM Grand. The atmosphere, ambiance, and service are all incredible. Our sever (and a Sake sommelier) walked us through the sake very well, and we ordered a half bottle of the tasty \"rice-wine.\" \n\nUpon starting with a tuna sashimi app, the ladyfriend & I knew we were in for something delicious. We followed up our app with a large \"combo platter\" type of entree with several rolls, some sashimi, and some nigiri. It was just incredible. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and beautiful to look at. \n\nWe finished out evening with a couple more cocktails post-sake, and an incredible Japanese-style tiramisu, which did not disappoint. \n\nThe only downfall was that for the last 20 minutes or so of our time there (after we had paid our bill) there was a fire alarm going off.  The sever told us it happens from time to time, but that it rarely stays on on long. Unfortunately for us, this time he was wrong. While it's not the fault of the restaurant itself, I was disappointed to watch every table around us get something free (sashimi, cocktails, sake, etc) to make up for the inconvenience while the Ladyfriend and I got nothing but apologies. I don't necessarily expect free food or drink to put me at ease, but when everyone else is given something and we're not, it's a little frustrating.\n\nOverall though, a phenomenal dining experience.\n\nRemember, this place is not cheap -- but it is most definitely worth it. If you're in Vegas, whether you're staying at MGM Grand or not, stop by Shibuya and eat your weight in sushi -- you'll be glad you did!"

We didn't have reservations, so we put our name down with the hostess, who said to return in an hour.  We killed some time by roaming the casino floor, came back, and were seated at the sushi bar (which I particularly enjoyed, especially in a place like this were there are 10-15 sushi chefs preparing food. it was quite interesting!).\n\nOur server was great.  I have never seen a sake menu as vast as theirs, and he recommended some excellent choices.  Did you know there is just a big of selection of sake as there is wine and beer?  Because I had no idea.  The food was great, fresh, and worth the price (when you add in the fact you are in Vegas).  The dishes were unique and they had some rare items that you only see in high end sushi restaurants.\n\n5 stars for Shibuya!  I will be back the next time I'm Vegas, which will hopefully be soon!"

My BF had the FIlet of Beef Tenderloin and I the Kobe style beef Tenderloin, I think he picked the cheapest cut of meat to compensate for what I ordered, because I think his was around 80 and mine almost 100.  Ouch. But this is Vegas right?? Anyhow, our entrees came with a greens salad with apple vinaigrette (pretty good), we both had the lobster miso soup (anything with lobster is delicious!!) and they cooked some organic vegetables (mushrooms, etc) and rice (we requested fried rice which was accomodated but just ok tasting) and our beef.  MMMM our beef.  So tender and juicy.  Would I go back and pay that much for music listening, massage demanding beef again?  Perhaps.  Then came the trio of dessert, presented on a cute dish, strawberry mochi ice cream, a mini chocolate cake and a mango mousse....all cute and delicious.  Our waiter was really nice and helpful, probably because we were the only people at the restaurant at the time.  He asked us questions and explained the menu in detail.

And it ended with mochi ice cream assortment. The portions were small but we were all super full by the end. I'd say this place is comparable to Nobu....although tough to tell because the one time that I went to Nobu, my dining companion and I had been far more adventurous with our selections and so I favor that restaurant over Shibuya in the food department for that reason alone.\n\nService: Our waiter was a little too obsequious and at the same time, there were stretches where I felt a little ignored. Overall though it was good service. The courses were spaced wide apart which was sort of wierd but it wasn't an issue.\n\nAmbiance: I have to admit this was my favorite part. The lighting is low and chic and the tables are separated by what looks like installations of wooden seaweed stretching to the high ceilings. It felt very fun but very stylish. Also even though it was crowded in there, it was not a total shit show and it was not filled with dbags, which is very nice when you're in Vegas. \n\nI'd definitely go back."

The service was superb, our waiter (whose name escapes me) was amazing and when I shared my love for uni and foie gras, he even added an extra ounce of foie gras on the house! To top it all off, he gave all my friends and me complimentary dessert just because it was their birthdays! And that's only the service! Now for the food, the braised pork rib topped with 2 succulent pieces of foie gras was to die for! The pork was cooked to perfection and the foie gras was seared perfectly and is definitely comparable to San Francisco's Gary Danko.

I'm used to getting a ginormous bowl of udon or pho for maybe 10? This came in a miso soup bowl with two shrimp. My overall impression was it was fine; none of us were disappointed in anything except the bill.

After all, what do you expect going to a nice sushi restaurant in Vegas?\n\nWe ordered the omakase and enough sake to kill a few samurai.  Oh my god, their omakase was probably the best I've ever had.  I will admit, that upon writing this review, I was sauced up enough to not clearly recall each dish.  So, my review may be slightly biased.  One dish I do recall was the shishito peppers, the only reason was because the waiter said to be careful with them because most were mild, but a few were HOT.  I love spicy food, so I remember popping them like candy looking for the hot ones.  The yellowtail was amazing, there were some shrimps that were delicious, some beef cuts that seemed to melt in my mouth, and after we thought we were done, they brought out three huge sushi/sashimi platters!  Loved it!  \n\nEven though the food, atmosphere, service, everything else was nothing short of impeccable, the best part of the whole night was getting the bill.  Since we were all on the gambling vibe, we decided to play credit card roulette.  For those not familiar with credit card roulette, our version involves every diner throwing in a credit card, and each person randomly takes out a card from the pile.  The last card remaining has to pay the entire bill.  \n\nThat was not a fun bill for my friend to pay."

Here's our dinner experience in the order they were served:\n\nAMUSE (ebi, cucumber sunomono and black sesame)\nThe shrimp was fresh.  The cucumber was refreshing - tart and sweet at the same time.  The sesame seeds brought an earthy taste as it normally does in sunomono.\n\nKANPACHI SASHIMI (garlic, black truffle oil, yuzu and micro greens)\nThis was the reason I wanted to come here in the first place.  The flavor combination was perfect and the black truffle oil was a very nice touch.  We were wiping off the plate clean with the fish.\n\nYELLOWTAIL (garlic ginger soy sauce, yuzu)\nFour beautiful pieces of hamachi.  The soy sauce and yuzu tasted like ponzu with the yuzu adding a citrus taste.\n\nKANI SALAD (snow, king and river crabs, pickled cucumber, seaweed and lotus chips)\nI don't know anybody else who gets excited over perfectly cooked lotus chips except for myself.  It was very thin, light and crispy.  The chunks of crab were fresh and sweet.  It also had some other greens.  The presentation was creative.  At the bottom of the clear salad bowl is a bowl with a shell, a plant and a betta fish swimming around.\n\nSEARED ALBACORE (crispy onions, japaleno and kimchee ponzu)\nThe ponzu was nice and the jalapeno was real tiny and thin so it won't burn your mouth. The crispy onions added texture and flavor to the albacore.\n\nSHIBAKI TUNA TARTARE (akami, spicy tobiko, avocado, mountain caviar, yuzu cream and yuba crisps)\nThe chopped akami was very fresh.  The avocado and yuzu cream gave this dish creaminess. Yuba crisps for that crunch.\n\nHAMACHI KAMA (hamachi collar with rice, bamboo shoot and truffle ponzu dipping sauce)\nThe skin was nice and crispy.  The best kama I've ever had.  The truffle ponzu was soooo delicious - there's truffle bits at the bottom of the bowl.  Since this is fish collar, expect bones.\n\nAUSTRALIAN WAGYU SKIRT STEAK \nIt was either this dish or the Australian Lobster and Scallop with Uni Butter Sauce.  Both sound good but it seemed like a good idea to have one dish with meat.  The steak was done medium and it was juicy, tender and melts-in-your-mouth good.\n\nKYOTO MISO SOUP (mitsuba, seaweed and tofu)\nNothing exciting.  It's miso soup.\n\nNIGIRI (Chef's choice for the evening: tuna, hamachi, albacore and salmon)\nGood fish to rice ratio.  Fresh fish.\n\nDESSERT TRIO (Jasmine Anmitsu, Choco-Lychee Mousse and Tiramisu Mochi Ice Cream)\nI like to eat my dessert from the least rich to the richest and creamiest so I had the anmitsu (tapioca, jelly, blueberry, raspberry in syrup and sake), half of the choco-lychee mousse, tiramisu mochi and the rest of my choco-lychee mousse because it was my favorite out of the three.  The Tiramisu mochi was a bit too frozen so it was hard but it was good nonetheless.  The choco-lychee mousse was light but creamy and I loved it!  None was too sweet which is typical of Japanese desserts.\n\nService was amazing despite a foodrunner serving us fish and chips which was not part of our omakase or the additional items we ordered.  It wasn't a big deal - we would've eaten it too if our server didn't catch the mistake!  It was a good way and a good place to celebrate."

I guess I was thinking I could find some good, tacky, simple sushi that would quickly fill me up and send me back to my room for a night in Vegas? Wrong.\n\nWhile the Black Cod and Salmon entree was good -- salmon coated in miso, Black Cod in pineapple -- it came with a taste of sauteed spinach and was generally too coated in pineapple and miso to really enjoy the fish. Sure, it was very pretty, but I wasn't in love with the taste.\n\nSo for a meal that was $50 for a glass of wine, cup of soup and an entree, I could have gone back to Wolfgang and had an as good meal for the same price.\n\nAt least sitting at the sushi bar and watching the sushi guys work was fun...?"

The reason I'm giving it just three stars is because if you get fresh high quality fish, order almost exclusively sashimi and you know the chef preparing it you have a better experience.  A meet the chef once sushi bar they don't know what you like or what you will try, like my local sushi bar Chef can. One nice option is they had several toro's to choose from along with some exotic fish I had not had the opportunity to try before."

Craving sushi, we were a bit hesitant to eat here due to the seating arrangements. For a high end restaurant, the tables resemble cafeteria benches a bit too much. My man approached the hostess and told her that we'd like a more intimate table or we'd be eating elsewhere. She told us that there were no tables open (the place was half empty) and that we could sit at the sushi bar. We were about to walk away when another girl ran up and led us to a semiprivate corner table. So I don't know what that was all about. Are they trying to seem exclusive?\nOur waiter was great, I wish I got his name. We started off with a large Orion (best Japanese beer) and two cold plates- the White Fish Sashimi and the Hamachi Wasabi. Both were delish. The wasabi plate was not hot at all, so try it if you're a wimp like me. Next we both had the Lobster Miso soup. The lobster was fresh and yummy, but the soup was actually fairly spicy, not resembling traditional miso soup at all. We ordered another sashimi plate that is brought out on a block of rock salt (can't remember the name). Unfortunately the server left it sitting for 5 minutes and the fish absorbed too much of the salt. Avoid this dish. The selection of sushi we ordered was spectacular except for the octopus. \nBy now we were on our 3rd or 4th Orion and were ready for dessert. Our waiter recommended the Kinaco Tiramisu- get this! It was so scrumptious. The ice cream mochi was good (hard to mess that up) and the Mango Sashimi was meh. \nNot 5 stars because for the price you don't get a fine dining experience. Our bill was $200, which is a lot when you're still smelling traces of casino smoke and watching groups of wannabe frat boys passing by."

Although quite friendly - we didn't see our server as often as we would expect and at times had to go ask other servers to go hunting for her. The food was superb with a menu that has so many delectable choices, you find it hard to make up your mind. The sushi is first grade and so fresh it's as if they caught it that day - instead of having it flown in from wherever. \n\nWe opted to eat at a regular table rather than the teppanyaki table, and were shuffled to the back. It seemed the only other tables available for us were hidden and romantic, but since I was with a client, I decided to stay at the first table they gave us - which was right by the kitchen and servers station. Luckily the food made up for it. We had the rock shrimp tempura and the black cod appetizers - YUM! The Dragon roll was my favourite from the sushi we ordered. Dessert was a banana concoction, also plate licking good... \n\nHad the service been better, I might have put it on the same plane as Nobu, but I think I will have to go back and give it a second chance to see if it is worthy."

The sushi was horrible, WAY overpriced, and the manager was a complete b-word. \n\nMy boyfriend and I wanted a roll that every sushi place we've been to has (we've been to a lot) and this place didn't have it. The problem with this was, the waiter said he would make it and call it a \"wsdjfsldf\" roll. We agreed because the other sushi we ordered was in our price range and we figured the waiter picked up on that (we ordered 5 rolls under $10).\n\nLong story short, the \"wehshd\" roll the waiter concocted made our bill over $100 (when it should've been around 60). When we talked to the manager about why we think that last ridiculously expensive roll (and disgusting, at that) should be adjusted, price wise, she was snotty and very rude and argued with my boyfriend for about 5 mintes. We should've skipped out on the entire bill. \n\nTo sum it up- service was horrible, food was beyond overpriced and not good sushi AT ALL.

Sushi is excellent-- fish are very high quality and the all-Japanese sushi chefs are quite skilled.  Unless you are a large group, I recommend sitting at the bar and watch their skilled 'performance' right at your eye level.\n\nWe had a course meal that started with delicious appetizers (raw and cooked fish beautifully presented), going on to super tender kobe-style beef, sushi and dessert.  Every course was good and it was so much food that we could not finish it all.  The sake cocktails we had were also very fine.  The waiter kept track of time well so that we could make it to a show in time after dinner.\n\nOne complaint-- the sushi part of the course meal was a piece of sashimi, one piece of nigiri and California rolls and spicy tuna rolls.  I wish I could have sampled real sushi rather than getting stuffed on American-invented rolls.  I felt bad for the chef though-- he was making big rolls all day, complaining 'this is what Americans eat.'  I know he'd rather be making nigiri."

Total: 3 stars.\n\nWalked around MGM looking for a nice place for dinner and wanted to escape from the constant cigarette smoke. Spotted Shibuya, read the reviews on Yelp, and then decided to give it a whirl.\n\nWhat we Ordered:\nOyster Tasting; Japanese Tofu (cool smoke effect from the dry ice); Lobster Salad; Tendon Udon; Shishito (grilled green peppers. not spicy.); Vegetable Tempura.\n\nQuality of the Food:\n-Generous portion of lobster pieces in the Lobster Salad.  \n-Vegetable Tempura consisted of shitake mushroom; sweet potato; yam; broccoli; enoki mushroom; zucchini; peppers.  Did not just give cheap veggies, like onions and carrots, as fillers.  \n-Generous portion of lean beef in the Tendon Udon.  \n\nTaste: Yummy.  \n\nPlating & Presentation: Very pretty.\n\nWait Staff/Customer Service: Unpolished/Mediocre.  \nOur wait staff were not rude; but not friendly.  It obvious that they did not master the art of being a server.  Example: tossing the dishes and bowls of rice onto the table.  Reached over us, while we were eating, to take away empty plates without excusing himself.  \n\nYes, we get it.  Wait staff in Vegas are aspiring actors, dancers, and millionaires.  Waiting on tables is just a gig to pay the bills and to keep body and soul together.  \n\nBut if the table was turned, wouldn't they want to have a positive dining experience at an expensive restaurant while on vacation?  \n\nEspecially during this tough economy when restaurants and retails are courting and fighting for customers' money.  \n\nThat's just my humble opinion.  Heck, what do I know? I am just a customer."

The host told us that they will hold the table up to 10 mins after 6:30 and if we don't get there by 6:40pm, they will give our table away.  We rushed over to the Signature to check-in and put the luggage away and we heard the phone rang and was told that if we don't get to the restaurant by 6:40pm, they will so give out table away.  We power walked from Tower 3 (the farthest tower from the walkway) to get to Shibuya.  I was wearing a 3 inch heel boots, but we really wanna make it to dinner.\n\nSo when we arrived, it wasn't even busy!!!!  Who were they going to give the table to...no one?  Anywho, we secured our table while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive.\n\nThe drinks were quite expensive.  A bottle of Asahi was like $8 and a cocktail drink was $14.  That's the price at the freakin club man. Their selected entrees comes with a salad with apple yuzu vinaigrette, choice of lobster or mushroom miso soup, vegetables, rice, and a dessert trio.  the salad was fresh and crisp, and the vinaigrette was very refreshing.  I chose the mushroom miso soup, and there were 3 different types of mushroom.  Was light and comforting.  \n\nMost of us got the Surf and Turf, which includes the 1/2 Australian Lobster Tail, 4 oz Tenderloin, and 3 Tiger Prawns.  The lobster tails were overcooked, the tenderloins were medium-rare and cooked perfectly, the prawns were overcooked as well.  Our party really enjoyed the three different sauces that were provided.  I like the garlic butter so I requested extra extra garlic butter on the side so I can dip the different protein into...I know, \"heart attack\" is bound to happen but I don't splurge like this all the time, and my cholesterol has been checked recently and I am normal.\n\nThe fried rice was next, after everyone pretty much finished our protein.  It was decent, but I must agree with fellow yelpers that I prefer Benihana's fried rice.  Just more flavor I believe.\nAt this point, we were so full, that we totally forgot about the veggies.  But that didn't stop the chef from pulling out a tray of asparagus, oyster mushroom, and another green veggie that I can't remember the name at this time.  He plated it nicely on a squared glass plate and handed to each of us.  A couple of us weren't a fan of this plate of veggie, and would rather prefer the Benihana veggies...\n\nOur Pastry Chef's Dessert Trio consisted of a vanilla mochi icecream, lychee inside chocolate something, and a raspberry gelee combined with something???  Well regardless, the raspberry dessert was everyone's favorite, which the lychee chocolate wasn't so yummy, and the mochi was kinda hard for some...\n\nAnyways, the chef was funny and friendly, restaurant is nice and clean, has quality ingredients, but I think the price is high."

Unfortunately it's a tiny place that looks like an average hole-in-the-wall type of venue with little decorations that try to look upscale. On to the food: it was good sushi, good soups, etc... Yet everything fell average from the taste to the extremely simple and boring presentation. Overall this was an expensive and boring experience that left my palate asking for more and my wallet asking for its money back."

My friend and I went on a Thursday afternoon before her flight and we were seated very promptly. The interior had a contemporary feel to it with wood, tinted glass and a pink chandelier by the tepanyaki table which was surprisingly lovely. We just ordered small plates of sushi and nigiri. Tried the Shibuya roll, that was very tasty. The fish is super fresh and the presentation was top notch. My friend said that the yellow tail sashimi was the best she has ever tasted. Now we had to try the Toro since we had the best one ever at Koi at planet Hollywood. Well, this one was the 2 Nd runner up in my opinion. The marbling was not was gorgeous as Koi's. The scallop and sea urchin was very good too-super fresh! You can still taste the sea water from the uni. The wine list was okay. The service was phenomenal. Will I be back? Possibly.

There really isn't a bad thing I can say about this place.  The sushi was alright, but being from San Diego I am spoiled with really fresh sushi.  This place is in a great spot if your in staying in the MGM and MGM signature.  My buddies loved it because it was close to the crap tables. LOL  \n\nThe food was really good.  The sushi rolls were prepared nicely and decent size.  But the best thing on their menu that will blow your socks off is the pork belly roll and the black miso cod.  Both are by far the best things on the menu.  I was say the black miso cod was the best, but both are a must get.  I didn't think the cost was too pricey for a nice restaurant in Vegas.  Nothing was over $40.00. and we got some good size portions for nice dinner.  The reason we spend so much is we bought a lot of sake and lot of cod. We couldn't get enough.  \n\nThe staff there was great. They were \"Johnny on the spot\" on clearing our dishes, refilling our drinks, and changing out silverware.  The do a good job of spoiling you.  One thing is you do need to make reservations because it does get a little busy, but its worth the wait."

We had five guys and opted to skip the tasting menus and just order a number of dishes for everyone to share.  Each of us ordering one cold dish, one hot dish and a selection of sushi was ample food for the five of us.\n\nAs a group of New Yorkers who eat out at Japanese restaurants often we were very pleased with all of our food.  Memorable dishes include the Shibaki Tuna Tartare (Cold), Yellowtail Sashimi (Cold), Salmon and Black Cod (Hot), and the Kurobuta Pork Crisp (Hot).  The deserts were fine but unremarkable.  \n\nThe service was excellent and prompt.  Orders were taken quickly, our waiter checked regularly if we wanted another round of drinks (of course we did!) and everyone was very friendly and helpful. Prices were manageable.  Between our three dishes each + desert/coffee + 2 rounds of cocktails each + tip/tax was $120.  Next time I am in Vegas I will absolutely be back."

We both love sushi and I like most other types of Japanese cuisine, so we tried our luck here.  The room is very nice, with the tables all isolated by semi-screens made of branches (or at least fake branches).  You get a little privacy, though it doesn't cut the noise too much and you can see most of the room.  It is a nice way to cut a middle ground between an open floorplan and screened in booths.\n\nI ordered the tasting menu, with salad (excellent), yellowtail sashimi with a very nice preparation (excellent), and steak with wild mushrooms (excellent), all for $59. It came with enough edamame to share (with plenty of rock salt - very good) and non-descript mochi ice cream for desert (fair). Something like a green tea creme brulee would have really set this meal apart, even something like fresh berries in a plum wine sauce over ice cream would have been good...  After all, I buy mochi at Trader Joe's, probably the same stuff.  We both enjoyed the lychee martinis, very tasty.\n\nMy fiance went with ala carte sushi, which she liked a lot.  She started with a sea weed salad sampler, with 4 types and preparations of seaweed.  All were very good, and it was nice to have the 4 since we had different favorites.\n\nDinner for the two of us, which several cocktails/wine was around $240, so it wasn't too insane for what we ordered."

Inspired by Tokyo, Japan's Shibuya district -- this upscale Japanese restaurant not only has delicious food, but has an extensive beer & sake selection. The menus are electronic, which already peaked my interest along with the extremely visually pleasing decor. Service was top notch, the food was exquisite from beginning to end -- truly the ultimate dining experience!\n\nWe started off with the WAGYU & FOIR GRAS GYOZAS, which were pan fried and paired with a garlic gomma ponzu sauce. We also ordered the TIGER ROLL (shrimp tempura topped with spicy tuna), SHIBUYA ROLL (soft shell crab topped with spicy albacore, ponzu & scallions) & KABUTO ROLL (australian lobster tail tempura with cucumber & kaiware). Wow. All three absolutely amazing! \n\nWe also opted for the teppanyaki dinner experience. Aside from your choice of main course, this includes an organic field greens salad with orange sesame soy dressing, kani or mushroom miso soup, seasonal vegetables & rice -- and their pastry chef's trio dessert. Everything is so fresh and delectably full of flavor, it is no wonder this place was voted \"best LV Japanese restaurant\" 6 times already!  \n\nFOR HER: The 8 OZ HOKKAIDO SCALLOPS.\nFOR HIM: The 12 OZ BLACK ANGUS RIBEYE."

I'm from New York but have lived in Las Vegas for the past 6 years and as a concierge at one of the premier hotels on the strip, I've been to just about every restaurant in town multiple times.  This was my second time to Shibuya and it was a very special occasion as it was my first anniversary with my girlfriend.  We both adore Japanese food the most out of any type of food so I figured it would be fitting for us to go here for our special day.  \n\nWe started off with a round of cocktails, which they were VERY generous with the pour counts on the vodka (but then again, charging 10 dollars for a cocktail is close to club prices lol).  Then we had the lobster salad (a MUST) and the wagyu beef carpaccio for apps.  Both were to die for, but the lobster salad was simply amazing.  I've never experienced such rich flavors in a dish of that type and it was seriously amazing.  I would go back there just to have that dish by itself.   For entrees we had a Japanese-style filet and Kobe beef short ribs....both cooked to perfection, although the ribs came with fois gras and that was a little nasty but that's just how they are.  \n\nThe only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 was because of the service.  Our server seemed like he didn't want to be there and was super short with us.  I kept trying to make conversation as the last time I went there our server was so happy to tell me about the menu.  He knew I was a concierge in Vegas and had a \"oh yea? that's cool i guess....\" look on his face. Also, I informed the manager during my reservation call that it was our anniversary and he didn't make mention of it until the VERY end when our desserts were brought out.  Just a bit weird for a server who is serving a couple on their anniversary and ordering things off the menu without regard to price.  I hope he knows that his tip would've been at least double what he got if did his job properly.  \n\nOverall, amazing food!!!  I'm sure the server doesn't represent the entire restaurant but it kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. I'll still return in a few months time and give them another shot."

The foie gras sauce for the gyoza was so rich and creamy, it is sooooo good. The gyoza didn't even have to have the wagyu in it and I would have loved it just for the sauce anyway. The tuna tartare type dish with crispy rice was very unique and I really enjoyed the crispy rice texture. The rice came out in little cubes on sticks for you to put the tartare on and squeeze a bit of a dark brown sauce from a pipette onto it. I didn't get a lot of savory or sweet from the sauce so I'm unsure if it was some sort of soy or teriyaki sauce or not. The seaweed tasting was good, I can take or leave it. The miso black cod was tasty, I recommend it. The shibuya specialty roll I thought would be better since it is their signature roll but nothing was spectactular about it. The choco lychee dessert is different, fruity with a hint of chocolate decadence. I enjoyed the saketini as that was light and refreshing. Great meal overall."

We saw other servers walking by our table multiple times, but our server was nowhere to be found. We had to flag someone else down and explain to them that they gave us one more roll then they should've. Our server wasn't rude or anything like that. Just MIA. The rolls were alright. Honestly, I've had better sushi at a supermarket. They weren't bad, just not near what we paid for. I will say, they had the best Moscato wine we've tasted in a while. My wife and I like sweet wines, and it definitely hit the spot. Finally, when we got the bill, they charged us for extra roll my wife got, which is what we didn't want happening. However, when we told our server about it, he corrected it before taking the bills of the other people with us. Which I thought was nice.\n\nOverall, overpriced sushi and I think it was one of the few bad times compared to other people's experiences. It's nice inside and had some awesome decor, but if the service isn't that great and the food is just alright, then decor doesn't mean much. Maybe if we go another time, and try another item, we'll have a different experience. I'm not one that just completely disregard a place based on one experience, unless it was an absolutely DISASTROUS time.

Not over the top good, but the quality was on par. No complaints.\n\nRock shrimp tempura: we are big fans of this dish and I'd have to say I think their prepartion is the best I've had in Las vegas so far. Perfectly amount of sauce, breading, etc.. this was a standout.\n\nKobe short rib: the waiter described it as Japanese pot roast.. and so it was. It was very tender, but I did find it kind of boring.

If you want to dine teppanyaki, then definitely call in advance or you won't get in and the menu is completely different at the regular tables.  Great sushi, extensive cocktail menu, and excellent wait staff and hostesses."

The food runner didn't know who had what for sure and we ended up ordering an extra dish because some one was eating the wrong dish. And for the price go to Nobu. $685 for 8 people with few drinks. Thank god for Jack in the box later on. Kinda disappointing for the price. I expected to pay that but I also expected a memorable experience. The experience was nonexistent. Don't waste your time."

We weren't that hungry so only had the rainbow roll and spicy tuna roll. The fish all tasted pretty fresh, but the best part was their tiramisu. I have never had tiramisu that looked the way this way did. It tasted like a tiramisu ice cream cake but it also had white foam with speckles of chocolate crispies on top..very interesting and delicious!"

We each had 1 drink, so this was really mostly the price of sushi.  \n\nWe ate a lot of sashimi (yellowtail, salmon, eel, tuna), as well as some delicious rolls (spicy salmon, eel + avocado, etc).  Honestly, we probably ate 12 separate orders of sushi between the 3 of us.  The quality was very good (honestly, if you get sushi in the desert, don't go somewhere sketchy!) and I'd definitely go back.  The ambiance was nice (kind of dark and moody), and it seemed like a nice date place.  I was there on business, but it was good because we were given a corner seat and the restaurant isn't very loud.  We were able to have a good, long conversation without feeling like the waiter was trying to scoot us out for the next group.\n\nAll in all, a delicious meal...but be prepared to drop some cash!"

When we inquired if we could have that, they told us it was fully booked. We decided to leave and made reservations elsewhere. When we were going to the other restaurant we strolled past this restaurant again, and asked if anything was available. We were seated immediately. When we sat down we were the only customers at any of the teppan tables. It was right at prime time too.

The 3 times I've been here, I was lucky enough not to have price be a factor in the food choice. I've tried toro cheek, oyster, uni, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi that was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I typically do not like Uni at all, but the selection here was so fresh and sweet - not fishy or salty tasting at all. Other favorites were Wagyu beef and this sweet glazed cod that was one of the most amazing cooked fish dishes I've ever had, period. We also tried uni fried rice and finished everything off with several dessert choices including mochi, a black sesame custard, and banana cream puffs. \n\nMy family brought guests who had never dined here before and they absolutely raved about the meal. Our waiter also recommended a lovely sake to compliment the food that was wonderful - slightly sweet and not too dry. We finished off 2 bottles of it. Our entire dinner was a well orchestrated performance. Loved it. \n\nOne caveat would be to realize that this place is not cheap... but I would hope the four $'s next to the restaurant name would tip people off to that fact. The above meal for 9 people came out to around $6,000. We were all stuffed and it was probably a bit more food than we needed, but it was New Years. You would be hard pressed to find similar quality food elsewhere, so if you can afford it, it is worth it."

            "review": "I went to Shibuya for dinner after reading some good reviews. I sat at the sushi bar and it was a bit cramped. Overall the decor is very modern and sophisticated. I liked the look of the place. \n\nMy server came over and I was pleased to find they had Justin Cabernet on their list. It is one of my favorite wines. I ordered a glass which arrived promptly. I ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura and an order of the fatty tuna to start. The food arrived expediently. Now, here is my issue- I love Nobu so this place was behind the eight ball. The rock shrimp were very tasty but the portion was so small. It was $21 for a bowl the size of a miso soup bowl, with these small little shrimp doused in spicy mayo. Nobu's tempura rock shrimp are much larger and actually come in a dinner sized portion. I would have thought Shibuya's tempura rock shrimp was an appetizer had I not been explicitly told it was an entree. And as an \"entree\" it comes with nothing else. \n\nThe fatty tuna was delicious, don't get me wrong. I'm accustomed to paying $20-25/2 piece sashimi. I was told the market price was $40. I was craving it so I got it and it was fresh and awesome but it seemed a little steep. My waiter came back around and I was still hungry so I got the salmon and avocado roll. It was some of the best salmon I've ever had. However, my waiter was harried, being in charge of literally the entire bar and some tables behind us. It seemed that on a busy weekend night, there should have been more help. I had ordered another glass of wine but it never came. I asked for my check and I had to have it altered because they had charged me for the wine even though I never actually received it. All in all, it cost me $120 with tip. It was not much food and while it was tasty, I don't know if I would make it a habit to return."

We went for the teppanyaki table, and as such the meal was a massacre of beef, prawns, lobster, scallops, and the 'fresh sustainable seafood' of the night, which happened to be one of my favorites, halibut.\n\nThe experience was great, albeit quite expensive.  Everything that hit the table, including the dessert, was delicious.  The fried rice and massive vegetable medley was awesome as well.  My slight complaint was that the chef held the plates and didn't serve them until all of the main courses (meats) had finished cooking. This was not a big deal, but its a bit torturous to watch the food stack up on the plate while you could be starting to munch.  I'm used to the plates being placed in front of the diners, and the meats & etc being added as they finish.\n\nThe food and service was great, 5-star caliber, but the very high price (each seat at the table is about a $100 commitment...) drives this to a 4 star rating overall.  I have had similar outstanding teppanyaki at lower prices.  This all said, the experience was great, and I'll be back for sure if the opportunity presents itself."

This binder was the equivalent to my comprehensive notebook from undergrad."

Also make sure you make reservations if you plan on going during the weekends as the wait can get up to 2hrs. \n\nLets just say anything MP, you cant go wrong.  First their Waygu is first class - Get the sashimi version as I think it's even better than the cooked version. If it's the one plate you are gonna get then it would be that one. And again you can't go wrong with their Otoro or Chutoro as both are like butter melting in your mouth. Even the MP tofu was freaking good, this coming from someone who doesn't even like tofu."

We both felt like a sushi night so we had a few different rolls and both enjoyed all of them. Go here if you want really great sushi for a fare price.

The rolls small and outrageous prices even for Vegas and all of em fell apart as we tried to eat them.  I know MGM is hurting financially and have drastically even cut back comps to  a bare minimum, but come on $16-17 for a  sashmi salad? Their signature roll is horrible.

They have sake sommeliers who did an adequate job of suggesting bottles for us. As a sake fiend though, I found their selections a bit pedestrian and too safe. Big list though, so a good place to go for sake sampling if you are new to sake. \n\nI won't go back, but only because I think my standards are higher for this price. Shibuya is obviously high-caliber style dining, but it just didn't strike me right for the price and what I got. I think the clumsy sake selection and insultingly overpriced sake list tainted my overall impression. Might go back to have a Sapporo and focus on the food if it's convenient."

The waiter knew everything about the menu and the tasting menu, including preparation and presentation methods for each dish.  Service was timely yet unobtrusive.\n\nPersonality 5/5. The interior of the restaurant is noisy but oddly intimate due to the dividers between the tables.  While it seemed loud inside I was able to talk in a normal voice to my date, yet we couldn't hear anything being said by the couple sitting a few feet away at another table .\n\nQuality 5/5.  We ordered the tasting menu because it seemed interesting and there were several items we had not eaten before.  Each dish was delicious and plated in an artistic manner so you ended up looking at the dish for a few minutes before trying it.  One item was served with a Siamese Fighting Fish in a bowl beneath the plate (\"You can eat everything but the fish, we need that one back\" joked the waiter). The portions were small but significant so by the time we reached the end of the menu we weren't overfull and our palates weren't overstimulated.\n\nRecommendation. 5/5 Worth the trip back to Las Vegas, Best for small groups or couples who want a nice relaxing dining experience."

Our waiter was very gracious and  attentive. The quality of the fish was out of this world. The salmon and tuna melted the second it hit our mouths. The presentation was simple and straight forward. The most surprising aspect of the night was the price; very very reasonable. Their roll prices are on par with what you would pay at your neighborhood sushi bar.

Hubby and I did a tasting here for our 9 year anniversary last weekend. \n\nYes, we are setting OC records for length of marriage ;)\n\nWe opted for the Omakase. For $120 pp, I felt it was reasonable in the sense that it's Vegas (there's always a markup) as well as recently doing an Omakase in a traditional Japanese restaurant in Honolulu for about the same amount of money. \n\nOur request for a corner table was honored. For 8:45 on a Thursday night, the restaurant wasn't packed. I felt like we had some privacy while still having a good view of the rest of the restaurant. \n\nThe menu sounded delicious and well balanced. I'm not sure if it's traditional or not but I like to start with raw and end with raw. The oyster with apple at the start is the perfect palate opener. The hamachi sashimi is fresh and vibrant. The hot dishes were the perfect amount of food. The sushi at the end was amazing. \n\nTwo things: I felt like there was a dish missing somewhere. I think a hot fish (not crustacean) dish somewhere in between would accent the menu perfectly. Miso glazed black cod? That would work. Secondly, the dessert could have been a little more substantial. Not heavy or elaborate, but I feel as though there was something missing - maybe it should have been a two parter? Dessert and then ice cream? \n\nThe pacing was perfect. The service was spot on. The ambiance of the restaurant is hip and cool without being \"in-your-face\". We had a lovely rose Champagne and stuck with that the entire meal because it accented everything perfectly. \n\nOverall, I'd overwhelmingly recommend Shibuya. Maybe not the next time, but in the future I see myself revisiting their menu!"

Came here with a buddy of mine after we spent the day testing our luck at the casino. Getting reservation for this place was a cakewalk considering that this time was their off-peak season. We practically had the place to ourselves but don't let the emptiness fool you. Shibuya delivers. PERIOD. \n\nOur choice of seating was at the bar in which case we all know, that's where the magic happens. Our waiter/sake sommelier was absolutely wonderful and helpful. He helped us choose a sake within the price range i suggested. I don't exactly remember the name but i do remember the lightly sweet taste and the clean finish of it (Junmai type).   \n\nI suggested to my buddy that we go for the Omakase which is a tasting course con prized of 7 dishes so we can get a taste of what they have to offer. He's down. All 7 dishes were of high quality but two really stood out. \n\nA) Sashimi Duo - Chu Toro, Ginger Soy Sauce and Spiced Crunchy Garlic Kanpachi, Yuzu Juice and Black Truffle Oil \n\nSeriously, what the eff??? Fatty tuna should be renamed fan-effin-tastic. I've never tasted such quality of Toro and Kanpachi. Freaking orgasmic!\n\nB) EZI EBI  - Australian Lobster Tail and Diver Scallops in Uni Sake Butter Sauce\n\nWow, just wow. I can't even describe what goes on here. That Uni sauce is ridiculous. If they put that *hit in a can and the end of the world was coming, you dam better believe there'd be riots at the supermarket.\n\n\nStaff was very friendly.

I'd say the food overall was about 3 stars, but when you factor in the price (and I don't care that it's on the strip and this is what I should expect to pay.  If you pay this much for food, it should be good, regardless of where you are) I have to bump it down a star.  My wife's best friend was in town with her husband.  They came into some Ka tickets at the last minute, so we had to find dinner at a specific time on short notice.  We tried a few places that didn't work, but Shibuya had an opening.  To start, we had the rock shrimp tempura, which was fantastic.  This is a pile of small shrimp tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce.  The evening was off to a great start.  The rolls we sampled (Tiger and Shibuya) were just okay.  The weren't wrapped well, all of us had trouble keeping them together.  \n\nFor entrees, our friends split the lobster and scallop dish, which is basically a bunch of seafood in a broth.  I enjoyed the broth, but some of the seafood was cooked a little long and became slightly tough.  I had the fish and chips.  I was excited to try a Japanese spin on this dish, but it wasn't that inventive.  The fish was still fried white fish, and the wasabi tartar had almost no kick.  The best part of the dish was probably the \"chips,\" 2 thin slices of potato tempura fried.  This was different from normal fish and chips, which is what I was looking for.\n\nThe wife had the Australian wagyu skirt steak.  This is served with a black pepper teriyaki sauce that the table universally enjoyed.  The steak was good, but certainly didn't blow us away.  Given the pedigree of wagyu, we were expecting more depth of flavor.\n\nThe table shared the calpico pannacotta for dessert.  The presentation was nifty (see photo) but this was way too tart for me.  The macaroons were okay, that was my favorite part of the dish.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy the meal, but we certainly left feeling like we did not get what we paid for."

I don't remember the exact details since that was actually almost two years ago, but I do recall that the fish was incredibly fresh and garnished with little delights that really added to each course. I also particularly remember completely, absolutely, undoubtedly, 100% loving the dessert. \n\nThat dessert experience carried over to my next visit, during which we came and ordered a bunch of items a la carte. My favorite part of the meal was my cappuccino tiramisu (so much espresso flavor!! so creamy!! so smooth!! and it's surprisingly light, especially for a tiramisu!), but we also extremely enjoyed the wagyu short rib with foie gras and the scallop and lobster (both hot dishes). The specialty sushi rolls we ordered were also commendable, but I think the short rib/foie gras and scallop/lobster dishes just overshadowed everything by being too amazing. \n\nTwo annoying points about this second visit, however. \n\n(1) We'd ordered tempura, but that didn't come out until *after* my dessert came, at which point we were pretty much already done eating. Keep in mind that I'd ordered dessert after I finished eating, whilst the tempura was ordered along with all our other entrees/appetizers, so that should give you an idea of how slowly it appeared. The tempura itself probably could've been some of the best that we'd ever had, but we were all too full to enjoy it properly. \n\n(2) Our party consisted of five guys and one girl (guess which one I was??). The guys were all wearing tank tops, and I was wearing a sleeveless dress, but they were all denied entrance because of a policy that guys have to have their shoulders covered (no similar rule for females). Their response? To wear the rattiest and most outlandish t-shirts that they had. But hey, it covered their shoulders, so they were allowed in. Seems a bit of an arbitrary distinction, especially considering that it's Vegas and people walk around in much worse/less. I don't see how a tank top is necessarily less classy than a flashy/gaudy t-shirt, but I'm not about to argue that point.\n\nToo busy dreaming about what dessert I'm going to order next time I come here."

I've spent only a little less in Orange County for comparable omakase meals without the Vegas vig.  Definitely better value than the old Shaboo omakase that used to be at BarMasa at the Aria.\n\nThe service was pretty good.  Had a few different servers come to the table and explain each dish.  Various wait staff helped service our table and the experience itself was excellent.  Omakase at the table is a little different in my opinion, I prefer the sushi bar but since this was a lot of hot/cold dishes instead of nigiri, overall it was a pretty good experience at the table."

No menus, no waiter, nobody to bring me my precious diet coke, oh the humanity.....\n\nAfter two visits to the hostess to ask them to send the waiter over, hey he appears, nice guy, quickly took the drink orders then asked if we had decided on the food side of things....\n\nThere are times, when everything is going wrong, that I actually pull back and don't become one of those people....A quiet \"we would love to, but we don't have menus\" gave us the look, you know the one, where a member of staff wants to say something, but the employee handbook says that that is a big no no.\n\nAnyways, so far, not a great start. but maybe it can be rescued.\n\nThe food orders were taken quickly, for me, the mushroom miso soup and the Wagyu skirt steak.\n\nMiso soup, very ordinary, I wasn't expecting anything amazing, but an above average miso would have been nice, this IMHO was no better than you would find at just about every teppanyaki joint in town.\n\nThe Wagyu skirt steak, one thing I have an unhealthy desire for is, hot food to be served hot, so when my steak came out and it was ice cold I had to look at the wife (she ordered the steak as well) just to double check I wasn't being an ass, nope, she actually asked if mine was cold as well, so quickly flagging the waiter, back they went, 10 minutes later, two new dishes come out, cold again, how you manage to cook a steak and have it served cold is beyond me, but to do it twice, that's just wrong at a restaurant charging these prices.\n\nWell Mr waiter went into hiding, we had 30 minutes to eat, pay and force our way into the MGM Garden with 12000 other people, so rather than send it back again, we ate, the taste was good, not the best Wagyu i've ever had, but it was nice.\n\nFinally the waiter returned, we asked for the check, quickly paid and ran out of there.\n\nFor those that follow, no the diet coke was not refilled, a major sin.\n\n\nI did try a piece of the miso cod a friend was having, it was very good, and hot, so maybe that is the way to go.\n\nAnyways, I can't honestly commender Shibuya, there are so many good restaurants in Vegas now, places that want to charge an arm, a leg and your first born son for a small portion of food need to get it right every time, Shibuya did not last night."

The high prices & trendy ambiance, naturally suggested we could expect great sushi too, but unfortunately that was not the case. We love sushi, and find ourselves eating it somewhere usually once per week, so I'd like to think we're a good judge of quality fish. Everything we ordered was very mediocre at best, and we couldn't help but to feel duped by the fancy decor. Maybe Las Vegas is just too far from the ocean? We're still on a hunt to find a good spot in Sin City!"

All employees were extremely professional and courteous, the chef was superb. I chose the \"surf and turf\" entree at $104... Yes PRICEY but truly one of the best meals I've ever enjoyed. My meal featured a compliments of the chef salmon appetizer, house salad which was again the best I've ever had which is hard to say about a salad. Then on to the crab soup, delicious. Then the main course. I'm sorry to say that after the main course I had no room to try the deserts but I can imagine it is as equally special. \n\nPros AMAZING food quality and flavor\n\nCons $$$$ $100 per plate average"

They have this really cool wall/aquarium behind the sushi bar right when you walk in.\n\nWe ordered this REALLY good chilled sake that was $70/bottle. It was a little fruity (think it was mango infused), but some of the best sake I ever had. Didn't have that weird after taste some Sake has and wasn't too sweet . Everyone loved it. Was a highlight!\n\nI got the Salmon/Sea Bass plate ($30) and it was very good. Very small portions, but the flavor was great. One side note was that the salmon was undercooked so I had to send it back, but they quickly brought it back out.\n\nThe sushi rolls we got were good, but nothing special.\n\nDidn't think the service was all that great, but it was okay. For instance, as we were getting ready to leave, some girls went to the bathroom and they took their full drinks away so we had to do say something and they brought us replacements, but annoying nonetheless..\n\nI spent around $80 with tip and drinks.\n\nOverall, it wasn't bad, but I thought the Grand Wok in the MGM was the same or better and much cheaper.  I would probably be more inclined to try another restaurant in Vegas before I went back to this one."

Many of my friends told me that we were much better off going there anyway - that Emeril's had taken a nose dive & that the food at Shibuya was going to be great.  We opted for the Summer Tasting menu at $59 per person and both of us were pleasantly surprised!  The chef put together a beautiful, interesting menu and all of the food was delicious!  Edamame was followed by greens with Yuzu Apple dressing (him) and Mozuku Soup, a chilled Japanese seaweed soup (me).  Next course was Yellowtail Sashimi and Spicy Tuna roll.  The main course was Black Angus Beef Tenderloin... so tender and flavorful... and a plate of Pineapple Miso Salmon and Shiro Miso Black Cod.  The cod is to die for!  For dessert, out came a little tray of Mochi Ice Cream - mango, lychee and I believe, chocolate.  The lychee was amazing, but you have to enjoy Mochi.  We had a lovely bottle of ice cold Saki which was reasonably priced.  Service was impeccable.  I'm looking forward to the Winter Tasting Menu - we'll definitely be back!"

My favorite roll was the Rainbow - but three split down the middle with 3 girls and a salad  left me still quite hungry even though I wasn't even that hungry to begin with. \n\nI also had a raspberry mojito. Apparently they were out of blood orange so I asked for this to be made instead. They charged me $4 less which was fantastic (as the blood orange mojito is $15), it was by far the weakest drink I had in Vegas but it did taste good. Our server said mine was much better than the other variety on the menu - and that the oranges are often very dry, so I wouldn't waste your $15.  \n\nService was fine - atmosphere was exceptional."

We asked our waiter if he knew why the ticket booth is closed and he said he would find out and let us know when the next show time was. He came back and told us that the next show was at 9:15 and the box office would reopen after dinner. He was totally wrong. We found out after dinner that cirque is on vacation, so instead of being able to walk across the hall to cirque we had to grab a cab to Mandalay bay to watch a different cirque show, and we were almost late because the waiter had no idea what he was talking about.\nOur waiter was a real let down... On the menu they offer 2 types of wagyu beef. Australian for $69 (3 oz) and Japanese $120 (3oz). When I asked the waiter what the difference is, he told me that the difference is $51 dollars. I clarified and said I wanted to know which was better and or which I should order and he had no idea, so I ordered the Australian and it was not very good. \nThe only saving grace for this review is that the sushi we got was fantastic. We got the Shibuya roll which despite its $25 price point was amazing. The spicy tuna roll was one if the best rolls I have ever had. \nOverall I recommend checking Shibuya out, but pray you don't get the same waiter I had."

We made reservations at Shibuya for a Wednesday night, at 8:00pm, although reservations probably weren't totally necessary, but whatever. From the hostess taking our reservations, to our waiter taking our bill, everyone who helped serve us were very attentive. We got a bottle of Sake, which I thought was a must. Now, yes, Shibuya may have been a little pricey, but it wasn't absurd. I've been to plenty of sushi restaurants, and I know quality when I see it, and definitely taste it, as in this instance. We ordered several pieces of sushi including the fatty tuna, and it was some of the best I had ever had. We also ordered the Shibuya Roll as well, and that was delicious as well. Oh yeah, we also had Oyster shooters as an appetizer as well. Nothing we ate that night smelled like fish, or tasted frozen. (You can tell if fish has been frozen by the excessive amount of water build up you get when biting into a piece of fish). Anyways, the portions were not small by any means. I think they were actually quite generous. I always believe that you get what you pay for, and this experience was well worth it. If you wanna be cheap, go down to the McDonald's just a couple feet down the path. I would highly recommend Shibuya to friends and family, and can't wait to go again, even if I don't stay at the MGM.

It took him about 15 minutes to come back to take our order after giving us the menus, and as far as I could tell, he was only working 2 other tables. Then, about 10 minutes later, he shows back up at the table with news (from the manager apparently) that the beer we ordered does not come in small bottles (which we did not request), and wanted to know whether large bottles were okay. We told him yes, and he returned about 5 minutes later with the beers and water, but the soda I had ordered did not arrive. By the time I realized it seconds later, the fellow who brought the drinks was gone (not our waiter), and the attention of our waiter was impossible to get (mostly because he was shooting the shit with a co-worker in the little room at the back where the cash register was). I finally got his attention some 10 minutes later, and he looked SHOCKED my soda wasn't there. He brought one 5 minutes later, and left, only for me to realize he brought the wrong kind. When I finally got his attention again and told him it was wrong, he was again, SHOCKED. By the time I got the soda I was so longing for, the meal was almost over. We had been sitting at our table for over 40 minutes. If that's the kind of service you're looking for, then go to Shibuya and ask for Aries!\n\nThe food, unlike the service, was good. We ordered a combination tempura, a shibuya roll, a hokkaido roll, a spicy tuna roll, a salmon avocado roll, and a snow crab california roll. The tuna was fresh, and the rolls were all well made and tasty. Not as good as Wafu in Costa Mesa, Ca, but good for what they were. I especially liked the spicy tuna roll. \n\nOverall, I was unhappy to have wasted my $60 portion of the check on a place with such horrible service. I really, really, really wanted to drink that soda at the beginning of my meal!!!"

Lil guy had udon with vegetables, agedashi tofu ($7) and an order of edamame ($5).\n\nFirst course: trio of 2 slices of toro drizzled with a yuzu soy sauce; tuna tartare with yuzu and avocado; toro tartare stack with beluga caviar and gold flakes. I was impressed with how my meal started. Everything on this plate tasted great and was beautifully presented although both the tartares kind of stuck to the plate when I tried to pick it up with my chopsticks and I ended up having to scrape it off with my chopsticks.\n\nSecond course (although it should really be the 4th): duo of hamachi and kanpachi. The former consisted of a garlic soy yuzu sauce while the latter was sitting in a marinade of black truffle oil and yuzu. Again both were rather pleasing to the palate.\n\nThird course (or is it the 6th now): beef tataki of thinly sliced Kobe beef drizzled with a soy sauce infused with garlic. Paper thin slivers of fried garlic on each slice of beef were accompanied with daikon sprouts. I didn't like the taste of the beef. It just didn't taste like how raw Kobe beef should taste - strong and rather off putting. The heavy sauce managed to mask the unpleasantness of the beef and the fried garlic helped immensely so it was still palatable in the end.\n\nSatay lobster in uni butter sauce as this dish was present also came with one large scallop - slightly overcooked so it was a tad chewy. I didn't think the satay complemented the dish at all. In fact, it overpowered the delicate flavor of uni and ended up making this dish mediocre at best. \n\nBeef short rib arrived very artistically presented. It included white asparagus, edamame, caramelized pearl onion and a small sliver of foie gras atop the beef. I loved the taste of the foie gras but the beef short rib was nothing special. It was no different than good galbijim and therefore didn't impress.\n\nI have no idea why they decided to add lobster to the miso soup because it did nothing for it. The miso soup itself was watery and unflavorful and the chunks of lobster meat was bland. It's hard to believe that a high end restaurant like this couldn't present a tastier version of something as simple as miso soup.\n\nThe final portion of the meal before dessert was the sushi. I thought it was excellent that they gave you fresh wasabi because it definitely enhances the sushi experience. However, I was extremely disappointed in the sushi itself. The rice was still on the al dente side and the fish was also not of superb quality. Maguro and salmon were okay - I've had far better elsewhere. The hirame (flounder) was surprisingly gristly. It was chewy and crunchy! Not very pleasant. I enjoyed the hamachi though, it was almost buttery in texture. I liked the ume which accompanied the sushi. This course was wonderfully presented (see photo).\n\nI was at the end of the meal portion and felt let down. It started off with a bang but slowly went downhill. How does this happen in an establishment such as this? Aren't the courses supposed to build into a crescendo until it explodes and then give the diner a sense of climax in the end?\n\nI guess the chef did somehow make it up with dessert because it was excellent. I being not a dessert fan had nothing but great things to say about the dessert trio which arrived. The rich chocolate ganache cake infused with sake was superb. The other two (names fail me) were also good. Both had something fruity in it so it wasn't heavy at all.\n\nIf I only had the first two courses and then the final dessert, I would've given them 5 stars. I thought service could've been better. They brought me a refill of iced tea ($3) once and then forgot about it. The courses also came out a tad too quickly, often before I'd even finished the previous course. \n\nFor a high-end establishment it was lacking both in service and the quality of food it was serving especially since I was paying $130 for the tasting menu. What truly rubbed me the wrong way was the fact that I ordered udon for the lil guy and the menu had shrimp tempura udon for $16. Since lil guy didn't eat shrimp I asked if they could do it with vegetables instead. The server told me sure they could but failed to inform me that I would be charged the same price. If I had known, I would've just ordered the shrimp tempura and ate it myself. In the end, I was charged $16 for plain udon with a few vegetables in it. When I questioned the server his response was \"it's not on the menu\". WTF??? This type of customer service is a reflection of poor management. Just because something is not on the menu doesn't mean you can't be flexible and offer a service to a customer when they ask for it. But after you offer that service you need to tell them that they would be charged the same amount and then let them make that decision.\n\nOrdinarily it would've been a 3 star rating but overall, they only get a 2."

            "review": "Shibuya comes highly rated. Conveniently located in the restaurant corridor of the MGM Grand, next to Craft Steak, it's a wonderful place to enjoy Japanese cuisine. Being the week of CES made it very difficult to get a reservation, but we were able to book via OpenTable since they insisted that they were full when we called directly.\n\nUpon arrival, we had to wait about 10 minutes while our table was being prepared. As other folks walked up to the hostess stand, they were kindly turned away saying the house was full and that nothing was available. This place must really be fantastic if they're going to turn people away like that...\n\nWe ordered the Chef's Special sushi platter, which came with 25 pcs of assorted sashimi. The quality of the fish was decent for a desert locale; I wondered how/when they manage to get their fish, being so far from the fish markets. There are better places here in LA, but for Vegas, definitely acceptable.\n\nIn addition to the sushi, we had the waygu striploin for a taste of beef. The meat came sliced and was garnished with crispy onion strings, accompanied by shimeji and maitake mushrooms. While it was good on its own, I couldn't resist getting a bowl of white rice to have with it.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Kinaco Tiramisu, an interesting take on tiramisu which is prepared with espresso coffee, kuromitsu syrup, kinaco ice cream, and topped with cappuccino foam. The foam doesn't do much for me and I was expecting more from the dessert since you're supposed to have some mascarpone and lady fingers, some density to the dessert. This was just glorified ice cream.\n\nIt'll probably be a while until I return to Shibuya, only because there is so much other food to enjoy in Vegas."

Everything was great,until the table behind us with a group of men were talking so loud, they talked about women walking by, then a guy yelled how many scores he gave her. The whole group laughed then they moved to scored more girls. They literally judged all the women walking by. They even took pictures. Oh my god! It was terrible and ruined the whole atmosphere. We talked to our service to move us or tell them to shut up. But he couldn't do it so we took off and canceled our meal. This is high end restaurant, i expect they have some solution in some case like this. Where is the security to kick them out? I even saw some people just left like us. Hopefully the restaurant would do something if this thing happens again."

We had an unusual apple marini, and a plum wine champagne cocktail. For a starter, we shared a yellowtail jalapeno roll. It was awesome. For the next course, I had a warm mushroom salad that was so delicious and rich. For the main course, I had a duo of black cod and red snapper, cooked to perfection and picture worthy. For dessert, we shared a homemade green tea ice cream plate and a duo of creme brule. I don't have a single negative thing to say about this place except I wish it was closer to where I lived!!"

            "review": "We were in Vegas for a conference at the MGM Grand this past week and saw this place as we were going back and forth to the convention area. I yelped it and made a reservation for 6:45p Tuesday night. I was expecting good food, and we were momentarily speechless when we tasted our first dish (sooooo good)! We had the tuna sashimi, which had a black truffle soy vinaigrette (OMG!), salmon avocado roll (simple, but perfect), kanpachi sashimi with garlic and fresh yuzu juice (refreshingly citrus-y), and a few pieces of tamago (sweet egg sushi). Neither of us had ever had tuna sashimi like that, and it was definitely our favorite. I love tamago, so am very picky, and felt that this did not receive as much attention. It was ok, but the egg was closer to the rubbery, overcooked side. For those who don't know, it's a slice of scrambled sweet egg omelet on top of sushi rice, wrapped with a thin band of seaweed. \n\nI thought our server was great, and gave us just enough attention (not hovering over us), and did not rush us. Though, at the end, we had to wait for the bill. We also had drinks (a lycheetini and a raspberry something with yuzu) which were smooth and sweet. We shared a creme brulee duo for dessert, and I chose some sencha tea. The creme brulee was two small cups, with a plum version in one cup, and a caramel ginger one in the other, with these flat sesame crackers/cookies on top. It was beautifully presented (as was everything). I thought the ginger brulee was more interesting, with more depth, and the plum brulee was more like your standard creme brulee (could not actually taste the plum at all), but they were both tasty.\n\nNow, we had had a snack a little earlier in the afternoon, so were not super hungry when we got to Shibuya. This was probably a good thing, as we could have easily spent another $100 or so for the two of us. As it was, our bill was about $120 (not including tip), which we forked over happily. If I get there again, I would definitely try the lobster tail and scallops. Actually, everything we saw looked unique and tasty. If you're in the mood for sushi and sashimi and have a big wallet, I wouldn't hesitate to give this place a try. One caution: this place can get noisy when it fills up."

(Was about $40 cheaper at the place in the Forum, but I'd pay it and go to Shibuya just to put things in perspective)  And I also tried the other sushi place in Caesars, that was ok again nothing special.

An army of sushi chefs stood at attention in front of us, with a huge lighting display resembling goldfish swimming through aqua waters filling the enormous wall behind them. Like so many Vegas restaurants the prices were steep. The decor oozed over-the-top opulance. But we were pleasantly surprised to see shrimp tempura udon for $16.50 on the menu and decided to order some sushi to go with it.\n\nWhen our waiter informed us there was no udon available that evening, we were not pleased, especially since the alternative dish he recommended was a handcut noodle dish with Kobe beef slices, available at the bargain price of $56 a bowl. I mean, how much more pretentious can a Vegas restaurant get? \n\nWe quickly went with a plan B: lobster miso soup, edamame, hamachi and sake nigiri, spicy tuna rolls, two bowls of rice.\n\nOur food took a while to arrive. While we waited, we watched several live lobster get brought out to the sushi bar. They were the biggest lobsters I've ever laid eyes on. I felt bad for the poor lobsters as they awaited their unfortunate fates. I watched three of them get chopped in half, their still-moving top halves placed atop a bed of julienned daikon radish, while their bottom halves were cut into pieces of sashimi, placed artistically back in their shells, and onto the plate. It was a little much even for me, a proud omnivore. \n\nI immediately regretted ordering the lobster miso soup and the sushi.\n\nThe food finally came out. And it was very good. The miso soup was a decent sized portion and had several good pieces of, gulp, lobster. The edamame was also a reasonable sized portion.\n\nBut it was the sushi (oh the sushi!) that really won me over. I expected a plate of tiny pieces of fish to show up. Nope. The slices of the incredibly fresh sake and hamachi were large, succulent, sublime. The spicy tuna rolls were also bursting with tuna. This sushi was some of the best I've ever had.

At the time, the article mentioned you could eat 100% Kobe beef with foie gras for $50.)\n\nSo we ended up getting the following:\n- braised kobe style short ribs & seared foie gras\n- Australian Wagyu (A4)\n- the chef recommendation for gyoza (australian wagyu with seared foie gras)\n- creme brulee (plum and cinnamon)\n- panna cotta\n\nI loved my Wagyu with ponzu sauce, even more than the one cooked at CUT.  It was so tender and practically melted in my mouth.  \nThe foie gras here is amazing, but I have mixed feelings about whether or not I'd eat it again... I mean really, they over feed an animal just to kill it for its liver.\nThe gyoza is the best gyoza I'll ever eat, I'm sure (you should definitely try it, if they have it available on the menu.  It was about $25 for 5 pieces)\nThe creme brulee came in two separate tins - I loved the plum more than the cinnamon.\nThe panna cotta was a bit to sweet for me, but the macaroons that it came with was amazing.  \n\nOverall, the food cooked here is superb, but the waiters are not as attentive as I would like."

They introduced me to Summer Snow nigori sake which I've been obsessed with ever since and I believe their chefs are flown in from Japan?  They serve the best traditional kani I've ever had and I order it where ever it's offered.  We've tried a lot here and we've always had excellent food, drink, and service.  The only problem we ever had here is that last time our server failed to set an ice bucket next to our table and the table next to us had one...we told him and he brought one out immediately...maybe he was new....\n\nI LOVE SHIBUYA!!!

This place has class, stops nowhere on pleasing the customer, and offers the teppanyaki experience this side of the \"Canyon.\" My wife and I were able to experience this delightful restaurant last night, I have to say that it was quite stellar. \n\nSo, on to the actual experience... We started by making a reservation (I think you have to make a reservation just to get a teppanyaki table). We were successful with a 2 hour prior reservation. I don't think we would have been so lucky on a weekend. This place was packed. \n\nWe aren't really Sake people, but for those that are, the menu is expansive. Ranging from about 55-999 a bottle. They also had many wines and champagnes ranging in price too. \n\nThe list of meats on the menu was also quite impressive (ranging from organic chicken, to Australian or Maine lobster, even up to Wagyu Beef cuts). Essentially, you pick the type of meat you want and it comes with vegies (oyster mushrooms, asparagus, broccolini), and steamed rice (tataki rice, for those who are rice fanatics). You can choose to upgrade from steamed rice a fried rice with different meats in it. We chose to have the Organic Chicken for a our main course and Wagyu beef fried rice. \n\nThe meal came with Amous Bouche (a seafood like treat of some nature that I didn't catch the name of), a spring green salad with an Apple yuzu dressing, a bowl of lobster or mushroom miso soup, and a desert tray consisting of a raspberry and custard-ish shot glass with gold flakes on it, a lychee fruit chocolate thing (sorry my brain isn't working today), and some pistachio ice cream encased in frozen fondant. \n\nThis was great experience folks. I would do it again in a heartbeat!"

To drink we did end up ordering Kirin beers, a $100 bottle of dry filtered sake, and six orders of Shibuya's own House Peach flavored sake as a dessert.  I recommend trying their House Peach sake since it's sweet, natural tasting, and good alcohol content at a very reasonable price.  They are known to be one of the most upscale Japanese restaurants in vegas and have one of the largest sake selections.  Thumbs up."

What topped it all off was the fact that MGM Grand hotel guests get a two-for-one deal with warm plate entrees.\n\nThe boyfriend got the Black Angus Tenderloin and I got the Seared Akami Tuna.  His steak was cooked perfectly and was so moist and tender and the Japanese mushrooms that came with it was just lightly seasoned and crispy and delicious!  I'm so glad he picked that dish 'cause I got to try some of it.  My dish came with seared tuna sliced up served with a vegetable roll which was a surprise to me.  I was disappointed that the discount didn't apply towards rolls but I ended up getting what I wanted anyways.  The fish of course was seasoned well and crisp on the outside, rare on the inside.  The vegetable roll had asparagus in it which was what I was craving for.  \n\nWe then got the Dessert Trio to share--Green Tea Mochi, some type of Lychee yogurt, and a chocolate mousse cake.  Everything was so darn good!  We also ordered a bottle of pink bubbly sake and a large Kirin to share.  Altogether the bill including gratuity was $100.  The meal and service was definitely worth the price.\n\nI'd give them 5 stars but of course there's just 1 tiny flaw I can't seem to get over.  The service was great, it came with a smile, and many helpful suggestions but I couldn't help but feel somewhat looked over.  The service wasn't bad but I did feel like the waiter we had was somewhat pretentious.  But all in all, I enjoyed the meal and would definitely return here if I happen to stay at MGM Grand or The Signature again."

Dubbed the NYC Times Square of Japan, Shibuya is electric, bustling, and sexy, just like its namesake restaurant in Las Vegas.  We've passed by Shibuya many times while walking MGM Grand's Studio Walk, and the scene was always the same: hoards of people crowding the hostess trying the get a table, and the sound of lively chatter coming from the restaurant.  Julius & I swore the next time we had the opportunity, we would come here for sure.  The opportunity struck the weekend we went to Vegas for the Pacquiao-Mosley fight!\n\nROUND 1\nUnfortunately, I can't say the night started off on the right foot.  We arrived early for our reservation, so we requested seats at the sushi bar.  The hostess told us there would be a little wait, so that was cool, until I saw her give the next 2 seats away to a couple of guys that arrived after us.  Low blow!  I TOLD Julius to be the one to talk to her, since he was a guy!  Scorecard:  0 Shibuya\n\nROUND 2\nJulius & I finally got seated, and enjoyed a nice bottle of sake, alternating toasts to Pac-Man as well as our early 10 year wedding anniversary :)  We took in the energetic atmosphere where techno music was playing and everyone around us seemed to be celebrating a special occasion.  What really reminded me of the city of Shibuya was the huge video display covering the entire back wall of the sushi bar (not to mention the wait staff walking around at a brisk pace like they do in Japan!)  The restaurant's party atmosphere was a knockout.  Scorecard:  1 Shibuya.\n\nROUND 3\nWhen we looked at the confusing menu (divided into hot & cold dishes, plus a separate tasting menu), I wasn't super impressed.  I think I was expecting either really eclectic or authentic Japanese fare, but the offerings were pretty standard. I guess it's because this was Vegas, and they had to cater to the masses.  We ordered a salad (a very simple, miso infused salad), oyster sampler (cute presentation of just 4 tiny oysters - you have to have a really refined palate to taste the difference between them!), the soft-shell crab tempura (surprisingly, the batter wasn't a light panko typical of tempura.  Instead, it reminded me more of the thick New Orleans-style batter), and the shishito peppers (delicate and spicy/sweet - probably the best thing of the night!)  So the food was good, but unfortunately, not really memorable (I had to Google the menu to jog my memory!)  Scorecard:  .5 Shibuya.\n\nROUND 4\nExcept for the hostess at the entrance, service was pretty good.   Our server was very attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu.  What sealed the deal for me was the little treat they presented at the end of our meal - complimentary green tea and chocolate mochi, beautifully plated, with a \"Happy Anniversary\" message on piece of white chocolate.  Dessert to me is usually the Main Event, so Shibuya was saved by the bell!  Scorecard:  1 Shibuya.  \n\nAfter our meal, we headed out to the MGM Grande Garden Arena to watch Pacquiao beat Mosley (woohoo!) Was Shibuya victorious as well?  Compared to other Japanese restaurants we've been to, not sure if Shibuya's food is a contender.  I think to fully appreciate the place, you have to dine at the Teppanyaki bar.  But if we're judging on ambience and d\u00e9cor, Shibuya is a heavyweight champ.  Final Scorecard:  3 Stars."

The email sent around said that first drink was free (which was a house mix), additional were 50% off. Well, as imagined everyone ordered a few expensive ones since we thought they were half off. Later the manager came over and said that the discount only applied if the second one was the house blend again, refused to bend on that which I thought was rather tacky. Bad on the waitstaff for telling us we were right when we asked if we were ordering correctly, and bad on the manager too because after such a nice meal it really left a bad taste.

The second time I called, the person said they had some \"internal personnel issues\" but someone should get back to me within a day.  It took me a 3rd phone call /voicemail to get someone to call me back.  \n\nSecond, there's a $125 \"large party fee\" for a party of 12 plus a $500 deposit if I want to reserve it.  I'm ok with the deposit although I think its steep but $125 large party fee is ridiculous!  \n\nThird, when I first spoke with Beverly, she said I had to pick a family-style menu ranging from $65 to $80pp (not incl tax, 20% gratuity).    After reading their website and the email info Beverly sent, I found out that you have to pick a family-style menu only if you have more than 15 people (for traditional style), and I only had 12.  Also, there was a cheaper family menu (girls night out $54) that she did not include in her email. \n\nBottomline - take your money and business elsewhere!

A varied menu of small tasting-size dishes at high prices (somewhat exorbitant in my view, but probably on par for Vegas).  $30 -$40 plates is more the norm than the exception.   \n\nFor $120 head (w/o tip or drinks), we elected for a prix-fixe tasting course of 10 different items. Some offerings were quite unique like the Iberico Pork Tataki  were just flat-out outstanding.  Other offerings like the Wagyu Beef Tataki was well worth the expense.  But mixed in to the great was the blah.   The sushi and sashimi mix was no better than some All-You-Can-Eat sushi joints and the Miso soup was just bad - by any standard.  In the end, I didn't have a bad meal but felt a little taken by the $120+ price tag given the bad with the good.\n\nThis place is for you if one of the following apply:\n\n1.) Your visit to Vegas is on a business trip and you can expense your meal - or better yet -\n2.) Have someone else pick up the tab\n3.) You just picked up a huge wad of cash at the casino and you don't know what to do with your hard earned winnings.\n4.) You're a poor planner, are starving, and there are literally no other dining options short of having a stroke.\n\nOther than that - there are plenty of better price vs. performance options in Vegas in my experience.\n\nPS.   Note that there is also a teppenyaki option at this restaurant.  Didn't really look at the menu but the place was deserted.  Not taking that as a good sign."

We shared the Spicy Scallop Roll and the Ryu (Eel, cucumber, Mango and avocado).   The scallop roll, while it said spicy, didn't have much of a kick but it was simple and had a fresh taste. The Ryu had many flavors swirling around and they worked very well! The salty eel sauce, the cool sweet of the mango and who doesn't love avocado?  I though both rolls were complimentary to each other and made for a great snack.\n\nI LOVED my Blood Orange Moijito... LOVED.  You still tasted the mint and lime but the hint of orange snuck in.  I could have drank them all night (but not at the Vegas drink prices).  My friend ordered a drink (can't remember the name) but it has plum wine, champagne (prosecco?) and a peach puree.  It was FAR to sweet for both of us.  Usually I love peach flavors, but this particular drink was all about the sweet peach flavor.\n\nOur time in Vegas was short and I wish that we could have gone back for dinner to sample the Nigiri and warm plates."

            "review": "Located at the MGM grand this Japanese restaurant is one of millions you can find in the city. So what makes it so special? Well for starters it's at the MGM grand. Why does that matter? Summer tastings, of course - 3 to 5 course meals at discounted prices at most restaurants. \n\nOf course I had to partake in the summer tasting menu, and the line-up was as follows: two raw fish courses (but not quite sushi/sashimi, we're talking a little more substantive), a surprisingly delicious salad, shrimp tempura lettuce wrap, short ribs, a sushi platter, and a dessert trio. 6 courses, $60/person. One of the best deals on the strip.\n\nI will never be able to do the 2 fish dishes justice. They were simply spectacular. One was kanpachi with a black truffle oil and some grated garlic, both powerful accompaniments for a delicate fish. It could've gone south so quickly, but the balance was beautiful, and really just helped develop the flavors of the fish, rather than stand in the way. The other was the albacore,with a citrus ponzu and fun little crispy onions on top. With the kanpachi, eat it all together. With the albacore, I wasn't thrilled with the onions with the fish, but each separately was a bite of heaven. Honestly, I would've been happy with that. But there were 5 more dishes on the way. The salad was simple, clean, elegant. Veggies, a little vinegar, a crispy little rice-type-deal, and we were on our way.\n\nMaybe lettuce wraps have been done before, yeah. Maybe you've had edamame at every japanese restaurant you've been to. But you haven't done these lettuce wraps so shut up. Rock shrimp tempura, coated in a messy and delicious aioli with a kick, sitting in a fresh piece of butter lettuce. I know right? For all the fancy that it has, it smacks of comfort food in a wonderful way. It's fried, it's garlic-y, it's like home. I wanted seconds, but this was a tasting menu. The edamame was great to munch on between courses, but honestly the service was so spot on that we rarely waited. Also, we were doing a sake pairing (additional money, children), so by round three were so pleasantly buzzed that they could've taken days to get us the next course and I don't think we'd have cared. When this intoxicated, the color-changing bar suddenly becomes so much more impressive. It's a huge, fairly deep bar perfect for making friends, watching the action, and spreading your food out when ordering lots of little things at the same time. Which is unquestionably the way to go if not the tasting menu. The point is: get some edamame. It's good for you.\n\nThe famed and long awaited short ribs were up next. These short ribs. Oh. My. Gd. These short ribs. Braised Kobe Short Ribs. With a hunka-hunka force-fed duck liver loving right on top. Tender, juicy, a little spice but not too much, a soy compliment that didn't taste entirely of salt. My heart stopped when I tasted this dish. To be honest, I'm not sure if it was from love or cholesterol. Either way, this is the dish of the house. They don't skimp on the foie gras, either - you get your money's worth for this one.\n\nBut we're so not done. I was already stuffed. You may be stuffed just from reading this post. But oh no, let's bring on the sushi. A little sushi? Maybe a lot of sushi. One down side to a tasting menu is that the sushi is not your call, it's the chefs, and it invariably tends to be the most popular, which isn't necessarily the most exotic, the most exciting, or the most traditional. Spicy tuna and california rolls (with crab, not krab), as well as 3 pieces each (one for each eater) of salmon, fatty tuna, and sea bass nigiri. Just look at that presentation. You know it was delicious. You know it was the best sushi I've had in years. But for those looking for the rare anago, the prepared-with-care hand rolls, or the less traditional \"special\" rolls like the Kabuto (a lobster tail tempura roll with cucumber and shiso), you'll sadly have to leave the realm of the tasting menu and strike out on your own. I wish you well.\n\nOh, but before you go, let me quickly mention dessert. A trio of their options was presented, each one better than the last. First, the Yuzu-Momo, a parfait that tasted mostly of strawberry, but the fruit honestly was refershing after all that food. Next, who'd have thunk it, tofu cheesecake. Tofu cheesecake? I was skeptical. It was maybe the most delicious cheesecake I've ever had. Wow. Completely different flavor, texture, everything. But there was something legitimate in that tiny little cake. Almost a vanilla-y thing kind of going on. Absolutely delicious."

For example, the definition of intelligence is sometimes given as the ability to learn from one's past mistakes but it is also said that the definition of stupidity is repeating the same action again and again and expecting a different outcome!\n\nWith certain honourable exceptions such as Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley, I tend to be wary of restaurants in hotels, regarding them as traps for hotel guests too lazy to leave the hotel in search of a top notch meal\n\nHowever, when I booked to watch Ka at the MGM Grand, I was intrigued by the omakase tasting menu at Shibuya, the Japanese restaurant located in their restaurant row. With a line-up of ingredients including toro, wagyu, foie gras and lobster, it looked very promising though I knew that it would take a first rate Japanese meal to satisfy me as I was also dining at another local Japanese legend in Vegas and favourite amongst Yelpers on the same trip - Raku (http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/raku-las-vegas#hrid:kQccGZ8GEw6cqZNBUqkwpQ)\n\nI made my reservation via the hotel website and the only wrinkle in the evening was that my table wasn't ready at the time I booked\n\nThe restaurant is gargantuan, a definite contrast to the intimate Raku but I did appreciate the stylish surroundungs. There was a Vegas buzz of excitement to the place and despite the size of the operation, my food arrived quickly but the meal was well paced\n\n1. Amuse of Kushi Oyster with Apple Momiji and Orange Ponzu\nI usually like my oysters freshly shucked, briney and metallic from the sea but here, the citrus notes did enhance the meaty oyster\n\n2. Trio of hamachi\nThis delicate fish was served in different preparations. Firstly as a sashimi with a hint of garlic, ginger and pepper. Then a tartar where the minced fish was mixed in with tobiko and garlic-infused ponzu. Lastly again as sashimi with wasabi, wasabi oil and Hawaiian red salt. A lovely contrast of 3 preparations\n\n3. Sashimi duo\nMy first slice of sashimi was one of my favourite fish - chu toro (fatty part of the tuna belly), served with ginger soy sauce and spiced crunchy garlic. The other piece was kanpachi, yuzu juice and black truffle oil. Yummy sashimi\n\n4. Tataki of Australian wagyu beef, lemon tamari soy, tarragon oil and garlic chips\nThe beef was almost sweet with freshness and the lemon lifted it with the nice contrast of crunchy garlic chips\n\n5. Ezi Ebi\nIf I tell you that this dish was Australian lobster tail and day boat scallops in uni sake butter sauce and that it tasted every bit as magnificent as it sounds, I think I can rest my case\n\n6. Niku\nBraised Kobe-style short rib was served with saut\u00e9ed foie gras and rounded off with sweet and spicy soy. The meat was meltingly tender and the sauce wasn't over-sweet. The umami hit from the foie gras was heavenly as usual\n\n7. Maine Lobster Miso Soup, Green Onions, Shitake Mushrooms\nNo ordinary soup as you can tell from the ingredients!\n\n8. Nigiri with freshly grated wasabi root\n\n9. Dessert Tasting\nRaspberry-Yuzu calpico pannacotta, choco-lychee mousse cake, and mochi ice cream proved a tasty, sweet and surprisingly light end to a magnificent meal\n\nAs you can tell just from reading the review (until Yelp invents smell-o-vision or taste-o-vision, I'm afraid my photos will have to do with helping me enhance my words), this was a legendary meal. Top class ingredients were treated sympahetically and allowed to sing with complementary sidekicks that enhanced and not take over. Recognisably Japanese but with a nod to western ingredients\n\nAs for restaurants in hotels, I'm very happy to eat my words provided the words are as delicious as the food at Shibuya!"

The place is nice and beautifully decorated, but the grills are way in the back and we ended up staring at a wall most of the night.  \nWe noticed the chef on the grill next to us wasn't interacting with the guests, so we hoped for a more fun experience than that table was getting.\n\nOrdering is simple, just pick the stuff and they bring it out and cook in front of you.  We had a quick appetizer tuna sushi and it was delicious.  The our chef came out and he was smiling and had a great personality and conversation as he cooked for us.   Not super entertaining like I had seen on TV, but the basics of a guy who knows how to handle a flat top grill for sure.  But again, maybe a slow night and we weren't guzzling the expensive sake either. \n\nThe odd thing after this was that the guy cooked everything separately and by the time he did Meat, Fried Rice , and Veggies.  My choice was to eat the meat first or let it go cold.  The evening sort of drug on while waiting on dessert course.  \n\nMaybe they were hoping we would just leave and they wouldn't need to bother with it....\n\nAnyway, it was good food and I am sure it will be different if I come back on a busier night.  I will search Yelp for some other places to compare as well.\n\nCheers"

They have a WIDE selection of sake so if thats what you like to drink, then this is your spot.  We tried the oyster tasting, lobster and day scallops, and black cod.  All of the items had a ton of flavor but were small in portion.  The prices were average by Vegas standards ($20-$30 each).  The ambiance and service is excellent so all and all, its a classy little place.\n\nGet your grub on."

I've tried most of the restaurants in MGM and Shibuya has them all beat!  The sushi is fresh and the variety of food is great.  My favorite items at Shibuya include the Kobe Beef Short Ribs with the seared foie gras!  It's to died for!  The meat just melts in your mouth and the foie gras is seared just right so that it doesn't take away the buttery-ness of it.  Another one of my favorite is their Uni sushi!!!! Yum!  I've had fresh sea urchins (still moving and all that) but these uni tasted better than the fresh ones!  Sooooo GOOOOOOD!  They have lots of great items but these two are my all time favorites at Shibuya."

I just want to start off by saying I'm an extremely picky eater because of my allergies but I completely threw everything out the window tonight. We went in a large group and had the chef's special. It was a LOT of food, so I'll just list them with comments. \n\nRock Shrimp: I'm allergic to shellfish but I didn't care, I ate 1/2 the plate\nWaygu slices: It's A4 I believe and everything I expected good beef to taste\nFatty Yellowtail: I dont know what sauce they used but this was amazing\nFoie Gras & Kobe Dumplings: As usual nothing but good things. \nSea Bass: Soft like butter and extremely flavorful\nFried Pork dish: I forget what this was called but it was pork that was wrapped in dough. I dont know if I like the sauce more than this dish but I essentially used the sauce for everything else I ate that night. \nSteak with truffle sauce: Compared to everything else this was good but not as good as what I've had so far\nSushi Platter: Uni was one of the best, Toro was ok, Yellowtail, Tuna and Salmon was good. \n\nDessert:\nMochi: They have unique flavors and I eventually bought a box from their distributor and it wasn't cheap.\nGreen Tea Cake: So freaking good\n2 Different Creme Brulees: As I said before. SO FREAKING GOOD.\nChocolate cake: this was only ok\n\nI'm sorry that this wasn't as detailed but I really didn't have any bad dishes. Everything was perfect and the service was just wonderful. People were super friendly and attentive. If this place wasn't so expensive I would eat here everyday. Also I think there was a celebrity sighting that night as well."

The three dishes that stood out was the hamachi trio; Chu Toro, Ginger Soy Sauce and Spiced Crunchy Garlic as part of the sashimi duo; and of course the foi gras as part of the Niku dish.  \n\nUnfortunately I can't remember the names of the sake we had, but I would definitely recommend that you try a few.  I can always appreciate good service.  For example, they provided us with a more expensive sake at a cheaper price just because they ran out of the one we requested.\n\nOverall, omakase is worth the $120 price tag.

I also ordered the tendon udon soup which was simply mouth watering, the meat was very soft and the broth, noodles were good as well.\nFor my entree i ordered the Braised Kobe style short rib & seared foie gras with white asparagus and a spicy sweet soy. Everything I ordered was awesome and the food presentation was very appealing. Everyone else that was dining with me enjoyed their food as well, this is definitely one place that I'm coming back to the next time I come to vegas, so if you my fellow yelpers are in Vegas and craving for some japanese food, this is the place to go.

I've lived in Japan before and travel there several times each year, so I have high standards for Japanese food, and Shibuya turned out to be a pleasant surprise.\n\nWe ate their two nights on our last trip to Las Vegas.  Both nights we had their sashimi platter.  Cheap, it is not ($100 for two), but the quality and quantity was very good.  Too often in the USA, sashimi seems watery and tasteless, the only thing separating tuna and salmon being color and not flavor.  That was not the case at Shibuya.  Each variety of fish had its characteristic taste and was very enjoyable.  My wife was especially pleased later when we ordered uni and it tasted like the uni we get at top Japanese sushi restaurants, and unlike what we get at even many top USA sushi restaurants.  Our itamae (sushi chef) wasn't a Japanese guy (he was from Hong Kong), but he seemed well trained and his outgoing nature made it nice to chat with him at the sushi bar.\n\nWe also ordered makisushi, and particularly enjoyed the Kabuto roll.  True, it is not typical Japanese makisushi, but wrapping a tempura-fried Australian lobster tail with cucumber, shiso, and kaiware in soy paper was a delicious combination (though a little challenging to eat because of its girth).\n\nWhat also impressed me about Shibuya was its sake list.  Finally, not the same old list of sakes found at top sushi restaurants across the United States.  Shibuya offered a range of hard-to-find sakes at prices that were reasonable, though not cheap.  Our sake was served chilled as requested and in champagne flutes rather than traditional sake glasses; that didn't bother me at all -- the sake was the perfect accompaniment to our meal.\n\nI also liked the lobster miso soup.  True it isn't as good as the shrimp or crab miso soup we get in Tokyo, but it's heart was in the right place and it was a good closing dish.\n\nDesserts were also a pleasant surprise.  The most notable one for me was the Kaffir Lime Creme Brulee.  OK, kaffir lime is not a Japanese ingredient (it's Thai -- I grow kaffir lime trees in my backyard), but the execution was great and the flavor was fantastic.  Every Thai restaurant should add this one to their dessert menu.\n\nThe biggest downside for me was probably the cost.  It was expensive, but given the quality of the food, I felt that the value was reasonable."

Only thing I'd stay away from is Sushi/Sashimi.  Not only they are very highly priced but I have had much better Sushi/Sashimi in other places for 1/3 of price.  For example, I ordered Chu-Toro and O-Toro Sushi.  $20 & $40 for 2 pieces each.  And to me their Toro wasn't the best Toro I have tried.  \n\nOn the other hand, Shibuya's hot plates are quite amazing.  Wagyu Steak w/Shitake mushroom was just cooked to perfection.  Oyster starter is must to try, they are tiny little oysters yet very very tasty.  Lobster salad was great as well.  One thing I also liked was their Kani Miso, yum.  \n\nAgain, this place isn't cheap Sushi joint so be prepare.  Me and my wife spent about $340 including tips.

Then I tried Shibuya's Wagyu beef.  Oh.  My.  God.  Possibly one of the most delightful items I have ever put in my mouth.  I could have eaten pounds of it, except for the fact that it was one of theose items listed on the menu as \"Market Price,\" a.k.a. Freaking Expensive.  I actually don't know what it cost since my boss was in charge of the ordering and the paying, but I'm pretty sure it was a damn lot.\n\nOtherwise, this place has average to slightly above average Japanese fare in a sexed-up setting.  Tempura was decent, sushi was fresh, but nothing was really worth waking up in the middle of the night over."

            "review": "I was looking forward to eating here because Vegas in recent years has become a gastronomical mecca. The decor in this place was grand and beautiful as are most places along the strip. We had a reservation so we got seated right away.\n\nSushi on the price spectrum I know is on the expensive side. Being that we're in Vegas, I get that we're going to pay a few more bucks. BUT I also expect that we're getting top notch food. I'm willing to pay the money for heaven on my tongue (get your mind out of the gutter, kids).\n\nWith that said, service was good. Our waiter knew his stuff, explained the various dishes and wide variety of sake to us, helping us settle on Jokugan sake. We're not big sake fans but this was so smooth it's what we look for now at other restaurants.\n\nFood: \nToro Tartare - amazing. Fresh fish, very cool plating (including gold flakes), highly recommended.\n\nPanko fried pork belly - not good. I'm aware there's going to be fat, hence, the pork belly. But when I bite into a strip of crispy fried goodness and can't actually bite a piece off, something's not right. Very few pieces on the plate were edible.\n\nShort ribs with foie grois - Yummy. Ribs were done right and the foie grois was a good complement.\n\nYellowtail with jalapeno pepper, spicy tuna roll - both delicious, fish was pretty fresh on both. The jalapeno pepper added a pleasant spicy kick to the roll. I still think it was overpriced though since there was nothing fancy in the ingredients.\n\nMochi - here was the surprising disappointment. There are four flavors on the plate: vanilla (if it's supposed to be lychee, doesn't really taste like it), mango, red bean and pistachio. All cut in half and beautifully displayed. Plenty for our table of three. However, two out of the four flavors had dry skin, as in the mochi was no longer chewy. That either means it was old or freezer burned. Ew. Either way, I can pull a mochi treat from my local grocery store and the skin will taste better than that.\n\nSo hopefully, they can bring all the food up to the level of the Toro Tartare. Otherwise, I don't think it's worth paying the prices here when there is outstanding food in Vegas."

We let him know that we did not request that item and he indicated that it would be no problem. At the end of the night we were surprised to find the roll still present on our bill (of over $300). We were even more surprised when the manager refused to remove the item from our bill. Furthermore, the manager would not even come out and speak with us about the decision or offer an apology. We were very disappointed by the service, and we would not recommend this establishment based on how we were treated."

The clear platter the Yellowtail came on really showed the opalescent color of the fish.  \n\nWarm Plates:\nAustralian Wagyu Skirt Steak - Japanese Mushrooms and Goma Sauce\nSalmon and Black Cod - Pineapple Miso Marinated Salmon and Shiro Miso Broiled Black Cod\n\nThe beef was tender and the mushrooms were delightfully fragrant.  Sliced pieces of fried garlic topped the entree, similar to Vietnamese cuisine.  If we had more time I would have licked the Goma sauce clean.  The portioning was surprisingly large.  With a bowl of rice, two people could easily eat this for dinner and be satisfied.  Both the salmon and black cod were cooked well.  Buttery and delicate.  \n\nI was not blown away by the selections of rolls at the end, but they were good.  Definitely helped absorb all the alcohol that I would be consuming that evening.\n\nThe four stars is simply for the service, the group friendly atmosphere, and the warm plates."

Very nice and modern, but what does it have to do with Japanese? For Americans, it's a good bluff. They like that kind of culture. Honestly? It reminds me of a club ambiance. \n\nFlip the card and your the looser. What do I mean? \nWe walked in on reservation. As soon as I saw the sushi bar and the chefs, I knew it wasn't going to be Japanese. The chefs were obviously Chinese and didn't have the professional look. \n\nDon't call the cards, your screwed! \nThe dinner for 6 came out to be around $1000. \nIt wasn't omakase or anything special. \nWe had; Uni fried rice, sashimi (toro, bluefin, hamachi, mirugai), grilled steak, pork belly, rainbow row, dragon roll, oysters.\n\nRainbow and dragon was as bad a buffets. Soggy rice, low quality fish, and over drizzled with sauce. Even worse than those jive ass rolls. \n\nSashimi wasn't prepared well. The daikon looked like it was prepared by machines. The fish was cut in weird proportions. Also displayed in bad manner. Bluefin was tearing apart as if the sushi chef went back and forth on the slices. Oh, did i mention that the chef forgot to put wasabi? We asked the waiter for wasabi, and we got some processed green stuff in huge portions. \n\n\n+ service was great\n+ for trying to be Japanese; they had Hitachino beer and some high end sake (at least they tried hard).  \n+ for casino style decorations and modern atmosphere; but what does this have to do with Japanese style?\n\n- should at least give real wasabi for the price they were charging. \n- fish just wasnt prepared right. the sushi chef definitely wasn't Japanese.\n- whats with teppanyaki setup in a japanese sushi restaurant? \n- very very fusion\n- overpriced for the quality\n\nHow did this restaurant get 4 stars on over 500+ reviews? \nI guess because it's Vegas. People are used to the big spending and trendy atmosphere. They really don't come to vegas for the high quality well prepared food. If your wallet is too heavy and want to thin it out, come for a treat. \n\nGood Luck and happy winning at Vegas"

However, I couldn't have been happier to stop in, sans reservation, before my husband and I ran off to the Bellagio for 'O'! And I literally mean that we stopped in on a Saturday night...we only had an hour before we had to be upstairs in our room, getting dressed, but saw open tables and decided to stop on whim.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful and classy and I felt underdressed in my jeans and flat-bottomed boots, though the hostesses surprisingly passed on a rather non-judgmental, friendly vibe. No foul; it IS Vegas after all, and anything goes!\n\nWe weren't exactly ravenous but knew we needed to eat, so we ordered a small variety. We started with the edamame, which was good...warm and adequately salted. We then ordered one warm plate (Australian lobster and day boat scallop), one specialty roll (Shibuya roll), and one order of sashimi (kanpachi). The best item, hands down, was the lobster & scallop plate...absolutely delicious. The uni butter sauce was savory and full of flavor, and I loved the rice at the bottom of the bowl that had soaked up that yummy sauce. The veggies, lobster, and scallop were all tender and amazing as well. Complaints? Well, for $35 the plate was rather skimpy (pretty small bowl; just two scallops and a few chunks of lobster among the veggies and rice). With that said, it was enough for us since we'd eaten a pretty late lunch. The Shibuya roll was not the best roll I'd had in my life, but was still very tasty and fresh. And the kanpachi (YOUNG yellowtail) was a recommendation from our server; apparently youth gives you a buttery taste. Sooo good...melted in our mouths!\n\nI would definitely go back just for that damn uni butter sauce, despite the scant portion of that dish...though not if I were watching my dollars. Definitely a pricey experience, but a great one if you decide to fork up the money. Good service, good food, and the Vegas fine dining experience...pretty awesome."

Our server and our chef were really great but considering there weren't that many people in the teppanyaki part of the restaurant they should be attentive. The chef did a little presentation but nothing compared to Benihana, honestly.  I am only giving two stars because I think the food is one of the most important aspects, especially in Las Vegas with all the restaurant competition.  My daughter ordered filet mignon and that was pretty amazing. My husband ordered the chicken and prawns and they were pretty good. My other daughter ordered chicken and liked it. I ordered the sea bass and prawn combo- really liked the prawns but the sea bass was not amazing- VERY fishy and somewhat mushy.   On top of that, we all wanted fried rice and that was $8-$12 extra per person depending on which one you ordered!  The soup and salad were ok and the desserts were good.  BENIHANA presentation, service, and taste far outweighed this place.  Will not be back."

It was confirmed by our waiter. Although, honestly, everyone knows that whatever you ask a person in Vegas, you're going to be kowtowed to anyway. \"Is this Chilean Sea Bass flown in today?\" Why of course sir!.  \"Can I get Himalayan Pink Salt with that?\"  Right away, sir. \n\nEverything in Vegas should be taken with that same grain of pink salt.  \n\nThat said, we sort of ended up at Shibuya. We couldn't think of a better option which, come to think of it means we were not in the mood to be driving!  There are better less expensive options a plenty off strip, believe me, we've been to fantastic places... some hole in the wall, others, like Roy's which are suburban \"nice.\"  \n\nMaybe Roy's is a good start to compare Shibuya. Presentation is similar, with a more flamboyant nod to Shibuya. Prices are similar.  But more importantly, taste, goes sadly to Roy's. I say sadly, because we ended up at Shibuya simply because we were in no shape to drive over to Roy's!  Not what you think, we imbibed nothing, but were just tired of walking.  \n\nMake sure to check into an MGM property and ask if you can use your various dining credits at sister properties.  Most of the time, they'll say, only at the property you're staying, but trust me, if you are nice about it, and ask the right people, I can't divulge who, you're just going to have to figure it out for yourselves; you can pick and choose where you're going to dine for the evening on the house... or at least at a better rate. \n\nThus we liked Shibuya, it was convenient, not too bad, rather tasty and fresh for our seafood cravings.  Tuna, Salmon and tempura were our triumvirate taste leaders, along with a wash down of tea. A very simple evening that went well. Servers were adequately obliging in that aforementioned Vegas manner... and the only real downside was the we could have gone to Roy's.  \n\nENJOY!"

Okay yes, that's what gets the 5 stars is unique selection. For starters, the tempura is not your average over fried vegetable. Oh no... it's filled with flavor and so good you find yourself licking the plate. \n\nWe were very impressed by the decor and service here at Shibuya. I dropped my napkin and like a bandit in the night, the waiter came out, and had a new one for me before I could reach down and get another one. We ordered a sushi dish, but decided we needed more because it was so fresh and yummy. \n\nI definitely recommend this place for a fun sushi night out in Vegas!"

I have to warn you though, it was very very very pricey but it is well worth the money. I may have went a little overboard but, for two people we paid about 120 including tip.\n For appetizer, I had the sashimi salad which has 3 different types of fish, some greens and lightly dressed. They also had these small round ball thingys that i just couldn't get enough of! It was delicious! i recommend this when going .\n\nFor dinner, we had some of the specialty rolls and some sashimi. The Sashimi just MELTS in your mouth and is cut thinly so that if you're not a big fan of it, it is still bearable. It was the best sashimi i've ever tasted. Every roll tasted so fresh and very neatly put together. \n\nFor dinner, we had the creme brulee duo which consists of the marinated plum and caramel ginger flavor. The plum flavor was a bit  of a shock. I didn't think you would put so much plum flavor in such a small pot of flan. The caramel ginger also tasted like they had too much ginger, but hey if you like a strong ginger taste go for it :) \n\nThe ambience: Very romantic setting. It was dark and they have these gorgeous red lights and surrounding each table/booth were these branch like dividers. It seems as if you are sitting in the woods. The staff was really friendly and the decor above the sushi chefs is indescribable. All I know is , I need to have on in my own house! \n\nOverall, I'd eat here over and over again even if it breaks my bank. Im a BIG sushi fan."

An older French gentleman who was as polite as humanly possible and made an amazingly tasty meal all the more memorable.  \n\nThis year the food was still excellent (the pineapple miso salmon and shiro miso black cod, along with a couple of their desserts are among the best things I've ever eaten), but the staff, a younger guy, was borderline awful.  He warmed up a bit as the evening wore on but when we first came in I got the feeling he couldn't decide whether to spit on us or seat us.  Not great.  \n\nEveryone has a bad day - the food was still great, and I'll be going back here again next time I'm in Vegas.\n\nBeautiful decor, by the way.

The decor is very modern and tasteful and the food seems to follow the same route. All of the sushis and sashimi seem to be unique, modern interpretations of the traditional favorites (Lobster Miso Soup, Albacore seared with onions, etc.)... Those seeking \"California Roll\" or \"Rainbow Roll\" will be better served elsewhere. The ambiance is much like Nobu in the Hard Rock: loud. If you're looking for quiet dining this is not it. Between the Teppan Yaki tables sprinkled throughout, and the boisterous, younger crowd heading to Studio 54 later in the night, the noise level takes some getting used to. The servers are professional if not overly friendly. The t-shirts on the busboys look a bit to casual for the surroundings. The wine list, particularly the sake, was extensive. My personal recomendations for those who decide to go are: GYO KAI SUNOMONO, SHIBAKI TUNA TARTARE, and TOBAN SPICED ALBACORE (which was the best item we ate)."

The cucumber roll was not my favorite because most places slice the cucumber thinly, as they would in a california roll, but here, they just put a huge chunk of cucumber =( The black cod and pineapple miso salmon were both amazing... the black cod was my favorite but that's because I'm super picky with my salmon, although the pineapple miso was interesting and very flavorful. I had some of my friends' mushroom salad and that was very delicious as well. I took off a star, because they didn't have any free desserts for birthdays so instead my friends had to buy me a tiramisu from them and they still charged us... The food was really good though!"

Airborne, whether plane or C130 cargo drop or space shuttle.\n\nHow do raw fish get transported to restaurants? Refrigerated trucks and supposedly maintain the right temperature. \n\n\nEating raw fish in the middle of the desert is just wrong. And I don't care of it's a 10 Michelin star restaurant. The idea of transporting fresh fish in a refrigerated truck that braved through the Vegas heat (day or night) is just wrong. Even the idea of transporting raw fish from downtown LA to Santa Monica is so repulsive already.\n\nBut I had a minor ankle sprain and we were hungry. We saw Shibuya and we walked in.\n\nThere were 5 to 6 Japanese chefs preparing sushi and dishes behind a marbled stone counter that measured about 15 to 20 ft., lined with seats. One would think, ok if one sits at the counter, whether it's directly or between two chefs, one can order from the chefs right then and there.\n\nUnfortunately no. \n\nWe sat and waited and none of the chefs communicated with us. Then a waiter came by and asked what we would like. That's how we ordered, ie through the waiter. \n\nHere's the thing. My intention was to come here and have a couple pieces of out-of-this-world sushi.  When a non-Japanese head chef stepped out of the kitchen from behind,  then and there I knew I have picked the wrong restaurant. But since we were already seated. \n\nSo from the menu, we picked Otoro, Uni, Unagi, Saba and a Matsu Platter (some kind of chef special).\n\nOtoro: two pathetic 1.75in by 0.75in. $40 a pair. Not as fresh and as fatty. Is this day-old Otoro? \n\nUni: fresh. 2 slices each. $12.\n\nUnagi: decent. $9\n\nthe WTF Matsu Platter: 8 small squares  with diced unidentified sashimi. $12. \n\nPlus of course green tea that has been thoroughly diluted or watered down. \n\nAnd how can anyone from LA think that this is an awesome Japanese restaurant? \n\nThe chefs work like a line of factory workers, slaves if I may. They rolled up sushi like what a sushi machine would.  I managed to catch the attention of the chef (Akira-san) who prepared our order. I also show my appreciation by thanking him personally before I left. I certainly hope he feels better working there that night. \n\nNot eating at this restaurant or any other seafood related restaurant in Vegas ever. \n\nAnd to think that Michael Mina has a seafood place just across from Shibuya...\n\nThese pple are just ridiculous."

Im not really a sake drinker so i didnt know what kind to get.  I was just about to pass on the sake and the waiter made a few suggestions which turned out to be good.  It was a 3 different kinds of sake sampler.\n\nThis place is a family style restaurant where you order a bunch of food and share it with the table, so we ordered a lot.  We ordered the Australian kobe beef with mushrooms, the meat is so soft and delicious i would go back just for this.  Steamed Chilean Seabass, which comes in a soup is also good.  You have to try the crab salad.  I think this is the best crab salad ever!  Its not big at all, it comes in this little bowl served on top of a swimming fish (which you cant eat).  \n\nWe also tried the rock shrimp tempura, which is wrapped in lettuce.  Yellow tail sushi and unagi.  The sushi here is quite a bit expensive with the yellow tail being 9 bucks for 2 pieces and unagi around the same price.  The yellow tail was definately worth it but not so much for the unagi.\n\nThen for dessert we had the warm chocolate cake, which has green tea ice cream and lychee rice tuile.\n\nNext time in vegas i'll be back for sure, prob wont get the unagi though.  But maybe i was so full already i just didnt feel like eatting it, i didnt really care if it fell on the floor.  haha\n\nIf you win a couple hundred dollars playing craps or blackjack, take your winnings to this place you wont be dissapointed."

Recommendations from the waiter were tasty.  \n\nWent to a different casino to recover the losses at the MGM ;-)"

The server was perfectly nice, but seemed very distracted.  He gave us our menus, and then when he came back, instead of asking what we wanted to drink, he took the food order from our friend, who we had designated to order all the sushi for us,and then took all the menus including our drink menu.  I know it can be difficult to try to get people to focus in such a big group as everyone is talking to each other, but as a server in a nice restaurant, you should be a pro at that.  We waited and chatted with each other for 10 minutes when I finally said, man, I need a DRINK, where is our waiter?!  We waved him down and my friend and I told him we'd like to order drinks.  He took our order and started walking away!!  The rest of our table was like, UH SIR!  Can the rest of us order drinks as well?!?  He apologized and took their order, but I found that to be so strange.\n\nOur sushi came and I everything was delicious.  It was just various rolls from the classic rolls section.  Also, my dirty martini was delicious.\n\nThe server came back and asked if we wanted dessert and we said no, then he brought us our check, but again, he never asked if we wanted more drinks.  Maybe he wanted to turn the table over?  Who knows, it was just weird.  Other than that, everything was great!"

There had been several occasions where I was craving something that wasn't on the menu, I asked the manager and next thing I know it's on the table ready for me to enjoy. \n\nDo try: Salmon and black Cod (one dish), Kurobuta pork crisp for hot plates. Sushi there is very fresh and tasty so I'd say pretty much anything on the sushi menu.\n\nMaybe skip: Their cocktails are weak. Opt for sake, beer, wine or liquors straight instead. \n\nPrice: Full dinner for two (drinks, apps, entree and dessert) will run you about $120+"

We made the right call. \n\nI'm going to do my best to retell what we had:\n\nTuna small plate with crispy onions and hot peppers - spicy and awesome!\n\nA different variety of tuna with arugula and a black truffle oil - such a unique and delicious dish!\n\nThe star of the meal: black angus steak cooked medium rare with a side of sauteed mushrooms and au jus. Literally the best steak I've ever had; and I don't even like steak!\n\nA variety of sushi rolls and sashimi - so much we couldn't eat all of it and I cried a little\n\nWe opted out of dessert, but it was an incredible meal from start to finish!

It was fantastic and we kept the peppers at the table all through out dinner.  We decided to share a warm plate and ordered the wagyu striploin.  I could have gotten a second order if we weren't also planning on ordering sushi.  The meat was just outstanding, the ponzu mustard sauce was a perfect accompaniment, and the mushrooms could have been a plate on their own.  It's been a couple of months since I had dinner here and I still think about this dish.  For our sushi order we did our usual, spicy tuna roll, white tuna, salmon, mackerel, and tamago.  Tamago is always like dessert for me.  The sushi was excellent.  Fresh, perfect portion of rice to fish, and balanced flavors.  \n\nThe one thing that I would take away from here is don't stick with the sushi you normally order at your local place.

OK, let that one slide. No one is perfect.

After awhile, the refills for the $4.50 iced tea stopped. No refills in a restaurant is definitely one of my biggest pet peeves while dining. \n\nOn a positive note, the food was awesome.

This particular staff really needs to clean up their act, and they would have an above average place to dine. \n\nThere are many places to choose from in Las Vegas, and no real reason why this place sticks out from the others (at least on a good note), so I probably won't be back."

The 3 star rating is due to the prices. 2 rolls of sushi and 2 miso soups for $70. I know it's Vegas but in my opinion that's way too much. If you have the extra cash, go with my blessing. Otherwise, hold your wallet for another sushi place. You can get similar quality for half the price elsewhere."

The quality of materials used constructing this place is above and beyond , execution was everything. The ambiance is absolutely stunning. The service was impeccable, and I mean impeccable.

We love Sushi, being fans of Takashi's in Salt Lake City, Fuki Sushi in Palo Alto, CA (most of the time), and Yoshi's in San Francisco (so we've got some decent Sushi experience under our belts.) So what can I say about their sushi?  I have had better at Whole Foods. Their Kampachi and Hamachi were flavorless, their Salmon tasted soapy, and their Rock and Roll hand roll had barbs. We ordered the vegetable tempura which was fair at bestand $19! Jeeeez!  Another appetizer my husband had was actually decent once he decided to eat half of them instead of the whole piece (they added a RIDICULOUS amount of rice to it). I agree with other posters that the portions were small on the whole. As for the ambiance: Interesting decor and color scheme made it fun to look around and appreciate the design. However, it was also FREEZING in the restaurant, and it was so loud our ears were ringing when we left. With 5 industrial cooking fans in the main dining area, it is no wonder. There is little opportunity to talk because the tables for 2 are quite long and there are no walls or partitions between any of the tables. Service was decent, but we paid $180 for our meal (which was ridiculous and so surreal we were just flabbergasted that we were charged so much for such sub par food) and we felt genuinely robbed. I would completely avoid this location if you want sushi while in Vegas. Try \"Yellowtail\" in the Bellagio instead - at the very least you'll be able to hear each other while you talk. We will NEVER eat here again. 2 stars."

The miso cod is also perfectly cooked though some may find it a bit salty. The beef tenderloin with asparagus and wasabi is not as good as the omakase beef that's has a sweet glaze. For dessert, the mochi ice cream are quite yummy. Overall, Shibuya is an excellent choice for a memorable dinner."

The sushi was nothing special, and other dishes couldn't make up for the underwhelming tastes. If you're looking for a great sushi experience, this may not be the place for you. \n\nLocation\n\nSeemingly great location, until you forced to walk through a packed Casino, down several hallways, all the way to the near back of the MGM Grand to finally reach the restaurant. I was prepared for an up-class, trendy experience, however after walked through the hords of smokers and casino-goers, I was already feeling less than upscale.\n\nAtmosphere\n\nOverall ambience was great. Nice decor, very trendy inside, however the host seated us at a bright table next to the teppanyaki bar - not ideal for a romantic dinner. We asked to be moved and were offered another table easily.\n\nNon-sushi Items\n\nStarted out with eda mame. Didn't think we could go wrong, however it was dry. After examining the prix fixe menu, we decided to go a la carte and order a cold dish, hot dish, sushi, and a few rolls. The yellowtail sushi cold dish was great - good taste, fresh, and good sauce. The rock shrimp was up next - just OK, nothing spectacular. Sauce was overpowering.\n\nSushi\n\nSashimi was good - fresh, delicious. Next, is where it all went down hill. We ordered a couple of fairly mainstream rolls - spicy tuna and salmon avocado. Both were very disappointing. The rice was dry and hard, and the seaweed tasted fishy and was tough. The presentation of the roll was lackluster with no ornamentation. We sent the first order back, and the master sushi prepared two more rolls and asked that we try it right away to prevent the rice from drying out, unfortunately, the second time wasn't the charm. For the build up, and the cost, I expected amazing, melt in the mouth rolls. This wasn't the case.\n\nOur server was helpful, and nice, and was willing to offer free dessert for our troubles, but at the end of the dinner, we were disappointed and declined."

For starters, the service is sparse and their prices are upscaled too much for their quality of food. \n\nThe nightly special was none other than... Bluefin Tuna. I was aghast. I couldn't believe an upscale sushi restaurant in Las Vegas was selling a redlisted (IUCN declared endangered species) fish on the menu. \n\nThe server's response to my reaction was futile. They claim to serve farm raised Bluefin Tuna from Spain. First off, wild caught Bluefin does not enter the realm of sustainable fisheries. No species that high in the food chain can be raised sustainable- it takes far too many resources (feed, water, etc). Lastly, Bluefin season is from August-September, any sourced in April is certainly not sustainable either. \n\nDon't support this company...!

Luckily my parents arrived on time for them to order on their own. I wound up ordering a Pork Kurobuta Crisp along with a Crab Dynamite roll. Also ordered an Orange Mojito which was I liked because I could barely taste the alcohol. While I'm not a big fan of crab, it tasted very good. I think my highlight was the desert.

I went here with my sister and her sister in law for a pre-show meal (we saw Ka). I had not been to the MGM in many years and although the casino was a complete zoo due to it being March madness, the restaurant was calm, cool, and serene. The decor was Asian inspired but very understated. It is the type of place you would be comfortable in a dress and heels or jeans. The service was very attentive but relaxed and not stuffy.\n\nSince there were three of us, the server recommended we order three cold plates and three hot ones which ended up being the perfect amount of food and we really enjoyed getting to share the various dishes. My pick for the cold plates was the seaweed tasting. This was sort of a sampler of different types of seaweed salad, all of which I enjoyed. The one I normally eat at my local sushi restaurant is called chuka and they also had a kelpy one called tosaka that I have had before as well. Then there was a sweet black one called hijaki that we all agreed was amazing and a redish one that was served somewhat pickled called shibazuke that was also tasty. We also ordered the jalapeno hamachi that was melt in your mouth good. And the noodle dish was our third cold plate. It came with a nest of buckwheat soba noodles as well as plump white udon noodles and a broth on the side with a few condiments. I thought maybe it wax intended to be eaten like a soup but I didn't see how that would work for sharing but our server explained that you were supposed to just dunk the noodles in the broth (which was cold) like a dressing. He brought us some forks so we didn't have to double-dip our chopsticks and so we polished off another tasty dish.\n\nFor warm plates we started with the gyoza which were quite tasty though they came with some kind of creamy sauce that none of us cared for instead of the traditional potsticker sauce. Then the mushroom salad (more of a saute than a salad) which was absolutely out-of-this-world fantastic. This was followed by the tenderloin and boy those mushrooms were even better with some steak. Throughout it all, our server kept us right on time for our show but still had good pacing in between dishes so we didn't feel rushed. I also tried one of their specialty cocktails, the ginger one, can't remember what it was called, and that hit the spot. I look forward to trying some sushi next time.\n\nI really enjoyed my meal here and I hope I have the pleasure of dining at Shibuya again in the future!"

We both got steak and lobster which also comes with some shrimp, zucchini, garlic, and a couple other veggies. We also got friend rice which was delicious.

Everything else we ordered was great and our waiter was extremely polite. A random drunk guy who was also eating at the restaurant came to sit with us and the waiter asked us if we were okay and wanted to know if the guy was bothering us. We let the drunk man be and had our free round of drinks. They also brought out complimentary dessert because my friend was celebrating something special. If you're a fan of sushi, come to shibuya while you're staying at the MGM."

Right now we're trying all new restaurants! Reviews to come. \n\nThe teppanyaki comes with:\n-Organic Field Greens with Apple Yuzu Vinaigrette\n-Choice of Lobster or Mushroom Miso Soup\n-California Farmers' Market Organic Vegetables and Tamaki Rice\n-Pastry Chef's Dessert Trio\n\nThe salad is mmm, mmm good! The vinaigrette is sweet but not too over powering. I always end up eating the rest of someone else's salad in addition to my own.\n\nI don't particularly love miso soup, but I will say that this one is pretty good. I've only had the lobster one, though I'm sure the mushroom on is good too.\n\nTheir vegetables are fresh and crispy and their fried rice is solid too. \n\nFor the entree I've had the 8 oz. select angus tenderloin and my bf gets the surf and turf. The cuts are juicy and tender! I think the last time I had it done medium well, but next time I'll try medium. Regardless, it was tasty and like butta! \n\nThe dessert trio seems to changes every so often. I find that it hits the spot. It's not amaaazing, but it's pretty good. It's perfect way to end your meal at Shibuya.\n\nMinus half  one star because it is a tad bit more expensive than I think it should be and for that price I want to see a onion fire volcano and stupid tricks when I eat teppanyaki! Silly me.\n\nNow, like everyone says about Vegas fine dining - it's usually overpriced but you as the customer should know what you are getting into and if it's too expensive for you then go somewhere else! This place is about $10-20 more than I'd spend for a really tasty meal in Vegas (which isn't much), but I'm there to have a good time with my friends, so it's worth it to spend a wee bit more. If its $50+ more than you want to spend, I would say go somewhere else.  \n\nIn the past I've come with a large group and as stated yes this place is pricy (duh, Vegas) but if you are going to come here and you are a carnivore, just get the beef!!! Unless you really aren't a fan beef and love chicken, stop being a cheap ass and get a beef entree. It's worth it! Ugh, who gets chicken?! Yawn, poultry - the boring meat. \n\nAnd last but not least, the service is excellent. The waiters were really nice and helpful. They check on you often and are attentive. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place if you are going to be eating at the MGM."

Celebrating our friend's last weeks of freedom before the proverbial \"ball and chain,\" we came to Shibuya for an evening of sake, food, and fun before hitting the clubs.  Our group (including my homeboy Bryant T. who also reviewed) decided on the omakase menu ($120), which came out to about a 9-course menu:\n\n- Started off with the amuse...a kushi oyster that I quickly slurpped up, knowing I was in for a treat.  \n- The hamachi trio followed, with different preparations of hamachi...I enjoyed the hamachi sashimi with garlic ginger and peppers.  \n- This was followed by 4 slices of fresh sashimi...the toro covered in spiced crunchy garlic was oishii (Japanese 101: oishii = delicious).  \n- We had ordered the wagyu beef tataki as an appetizer before the omakase menu, but it came with about 4 pieces of tataki; be sure to have a garlic chip with each piece.  \n- Up next, lobster tail and scallops in an uni sake butter sauce...for this dish, I wish I had bread to soak in the sauce because I felt a little awkward licking the bowl dry.  \n- The kobe short rib with foie gras came next...I enjoy anything foie gras, so it was no surprise I found this dish enjoyable.  The sauce that the beef was braised in was once again amazing, and my tongue once again found its way to the bottom of the dish.  \n- Now usually in Japanese culture, the meal starts with miso soup.  We're almost done with our meal and here they are bringing out this soup...with huge chunks of lobster and mini shiitake mushrooms.  In almost every spoonful, I found a nice piece of lobster.  While the soup itself wasn't anything special on it's own, with lobster, it was awesome.  \n- The chef selected 4 pieces of sushi; a salmon, ahi, and two others...I was already getting full by this point, so I didn't eat the rice and just had the sashimi pieces on top.\n- Last, but not least, the dessert tasting: A green tea mochi cream that was cut in half, a light chocolate cake topped with a lychee slice, and a raspberry-yuzu calpico pannacotta, which was a light and refreshing way to end the meal.  \n\nWhile what happens in Vegas should stay in Vegas, I had to share this experience."

Every seating area is a private table (divided from other tables by the ultra neat wood carved panels) and there's no chance of bumping up against any other table. The dimly lit restaurant is warm and romantic. \n\nI ordered the Omakase ($120) and was amazed at the presentation, the taste and creativity of the food as the dishes came out one after another, never feeling rushed. If I go back, I will do it all over again. I highly recommend this option for people that want a variety of Japanese food and don't want to stick to just the sushi menu. \n\nThe order of the Omakase is arranged so that the dishes served in the beginning will not fill you up before you enjoy the remaining dishes. The portions are also appropriate where you can eat all the dishes and not run out of steam before the end, as I'm sure the chef wants you to enjoy every single dish. \n\nBoy ordered the Wagyu steak which was cooked so tender, it melted in my mouth. We had eaten the Wagyu at Stripsteak the night before, and this was BY FAR a much tastier and better cooked steak. \n\nDrinks were delicious - I love it when Japanese restaurants offer unique drinks using Japanese liquer. I ordered the Momo which reminded me of the peachy hard candies my grandmother used to buy me. \n\nIndeed this place is a splurge but going in expecting this will save you from the bitterness that will overshadow your experience."

The sushi chefs are fun to watch, but are not all all engaging, even when you try.  I know they are busy, but the true masters like Sam Okamoto can work with blazing speed while being entertaining an engaging.  Based on food and service alone this place is very much worth a try for any fans of sushi while in Vegas."

From the first step into Shibuya you are captivated by the sleek modern romanced ambiance! We were welcomed immediately being ushered to our night to remember! \n\nAries, my most admired server I have yet had, made the night an unforgettable one with his simple ease, knowledge, and truly one of a kind personality! We started our night off with a bottle of Perrier-Jou\u00ebt Grand Brut that I highly recommend and paired perfectly with our Nine Course Chefs Tasting Menu! \n\nThe Chefs Tasting Menu was a easy decision and something I had always wanted to experience! Where better than Shibuya! \n\nDish One | Zensai: A single sexy fresh Oyster with Ponzu Sauce then Garnished with Scallions! A perfect palate starter that awakens your tastebuds! \n\nDish Two | Raw: Hakkaido Scallop served Raw with Nasu and Jalape\u00f1o Ponzu! Soft-Buttery Deliciousness! First time having Raw Scallops and WOW my mouth is watering for more! \n\nDish Three | Sashimi: Shibuya Style Salmon \"Poke\" with Avocado/ Wasabi/ Sesame Ginger Soy/ Crispy Taro! Silky-Smooth with great texture and freshness! \n\nDish Four | Tataki: Iberico Pork Tataki Garnished with Candied Mustard Seed and Apple Cider Ponzu! Beautiful on the Inside and Out! Seared Very Briefly then Marinated in Vinegar for a Bold Statement!  \n\nDish Five | Fish: Black Cod Miso with Spinach and Hajikami! This dish stole my heart with the first luscious bite! Cooked to Perfection with an intense flavor profile! My favorite!\n\nDish Six | Meat: Australia Wagyu Skirt accompanied by fresh Kizami Wasbi Salsa! Grade A Beef/ Tender and Succulent! \n\nDish Seven | Sushi: Assortment of White Fish/ Salmon/ Yellowtail/ Tuna! We also wanted to try Uni for the first time which they will graciously add any sushi bar assortments to your meal! Excellent knife work all being very refreshing! \n\nDish Eight | Soup: Kyoto Miso Soup. Our least favorite dish as it was Extremely salty to the point we did not take more than one bite. \n\nSo by this point we are Overindulged with all these decadent dishes and tell Aries not to bring out our last beloved Dessert Tasting. However, of course he knows we MUST try their peerless desserts to finish out our night and WOW I am so glad he did! \n\nDish Nine | Dessert Tasting: Lychee Yogurt Parfait/ Matcha Choux/ Melon Mochi Ice Cream! Each Dessert Tasting was fantastic being the perfect conclusion to our meal! \n\nThe most artistic meal that I have consumed made with so much detail, passion, and execution! Everything was over the top and most desired minus the Miso Soup. Our night could not have gone any smoother and with Aries taking care of us we felt like the only ones in the restaurant! All of Shibuya's staff were outstanding and presented each dish to us with the name and contents! \n~~Fall in Love with the Best of the Best; Shibuya!"

They should be used to that!) and had to sit at the sushi bar (not great for conversation when you're with a group!).  We asked for the hibachi menu and were given it, and when we went to order the waiter said we couldn't order it b/c we were at the sushi bar (so why did you give us the menu!?!?!). Anyway, my husband got the scallops and lobster $35 and I got Miso $7 and a roll $20.  The scallops and lobster was a JOKE it was SOOOOO SMALL! My husband thought they messed up his order. It was a tiny bowl of red soup. My roll was OK, but NOT $20 good! Here in Tampa you can have your mind blown with a fresh $7 roll! We split one of those giant beers as we were already pretty drunk. Bill came to $88 before tip for 1 beer, 1 roll, 1 miso and 1 small bowl of red liquid that apparently had lobster chunks in it.  Needless to say, we stopped at McDonald's after to satisfy our drunk munchies!\n\n*Note, I have had the teppanyaki here before as well, and it didn't blow my mind.

Same with the large-ish portion of fois gras (yeah, you can't get it in Califrnia, but that doesn't mean I'm hankering for a large amount of such a potent product).  That's two stars down from 5.\n\nAs we make it to the home stretch, we get the nigiri course.  I trade a piece of hamachi (Betty's favorite) for her piece of maguro.  Never having had reason to doubt the skills of the sushi crew here, I popped a piece of tuna in my gob that was already shuffling off to its reward -- you get that sort of ammonia aftertaste effect.  Sure enough, we both sniff the remaining maguro, and it's whiffy.  AT A PLACE THIS GOOD, THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN.\n\nWe called this to the attention of our server (friendly, effective) and after a bit, a manager (?) comes by with another piece of tuna (large piece, by gar, beautiful to behold), but with that first bit already seeking repatriation with the real world, I just can't countenance another attempt.  I poke around the desert, but most of it remains; I just have zero appetite.\n\nNow, even at Starbucks, if something goes slightly wrong in prep, you don't pay for it, and you'll probably be graced by one of their \"have another on us\" cards.  That wasn't the case here... leaving an even worse impression by paying full boat for what should have been, but wasn't, a wonderful meal.\n\nThe saving grace is the excellent staff, those dishes that weren't truffle oil or fois gras based and a nice sake tasting flight.\n\nOne utterly unrelated positive thing, while we're sitting in the front of the place, staring at hordes of humanity wandering by, we spot Tom Calicchio (out of \"Top Chef\" and owner of Craftsteak next door) zipping by."

I recommend sharing food for teppanyaki because it's a lot of food if you order one protein per person especially if you're also getting rice. I ordered scallops and got like 9 and ate like 4.

So, I'll admit, my sushi palette is not as sophisticated as it used to. Lately, sushi for me has been more of a craving, and almost any place will do - hell, if Todai was still around, I'd be ok.\n\nSo, I got the responsibility of picking the dinner this evening with one condition - Sushi. Having not done any research before we came, this was a difficult task. I typed Sushi in my trusty dusty Yelp app, and looked for the place with most reviews and highest stars. Shibuya came up (although there's another place in the Wynn that looked amazing), so I OpenTable'd it and here we are. I frantically read through dozens of Yelp reviews trying to get recommendations, and I have to say, it was a most pleasing experience!\n\nKAMPACHI SASHIMI\nThis is very very thinly sliced tuna sashimi with Yuzu Juice and black truffle oil. What the hell is Yuzu juice and black truffle oil? I have no clue (see what I mean by \"not sophisticated anymore?\")! There was something of a sesame oil taste + ginger/garlic, and something sweet. The pieces were probably about a millimeter thick, if even that, so your chopstick work better be good. There are also what we mused \"balls o' fun\" on top which are these tiny ricecake balls, about the size of mustard seeds sprinkled on top that added a nice crackle with each bite. This thing was freaking incredible! The tuna was so fresh (not fishy) and the flavors and seasoning were just spot on. It was a little sweet, salty, and the texture of the sashimi was divine. I'm won't say it's \"melt in your mouth,\" because I'm saving that description for later... I swear, if I could have a small bowl of rice, and about 12 orders of these, I'd be in heaven! \n\nROLLS\nOur table of 4 got 5 rolls, but I don't remember what we got. Here is what I do know and remember, it was technically perfect! Maki to me needs to have the following things for technical perfection:\n- Rice should be a very thin layer just to hold it together. Sushi to rice ratio must be heavily on the sushi side.\n- Rice needs to be fresh (not hard), and have a noticeable but not overbearing hint of vinegar.\n- Sushi must be central to the roll. Avocado can't be bigger than sushi, etc.\n\nSo yeah, they were all technically perfect. \n\nOH TORO SUSHI\nI was feeling very charitable (you know, Las Vegas + 1 Sapporo Beer), so I offered to buy a piece of Oh Toro Nigiri for everyone. Other nigiris listed were like $20 for 2 pieces, so I was thinking, $40 total, no problem. Well, Oh Toro was market price and MP that day was $40, and suddenly, my wallet felt cavernous and empty. Well, I asked if I could order 1, but if they could split the 2 nigiris into 4 pieces, which they very kindly obliged. \n\nQuick lesson: The term \"Toro Sushi\" is for the fatty part of the tuna in the belly area. What I didn't know was that there is Chutoro, and Otoro. Chutoro is the leaner side of the belly meat, where Otoro is the fattiest portion, sometimes known to literally melt in your mouth!\n\nWell, that last part - is true! I bit half of it off without any rice or soysauce/wasabi, just to get the full effect. While I can't say much for flavor or seasoning, the texture was unbelievable! I mean, it literally melted in my mouth, or I'm sure it would have if I didn't start chewing...with the roof of my mouth and my tongue! It was so soft and buttery! The last bite I took with rice and soysauce, and again the texture was great, but it almost transformed the flavor! It wasn't just Otoro + rice & soysauce, it was some sort of new taste that was selectively pieced together. If I was a billionaire, yes, I'd eat this stuff everyday.........then get fat and die of heart disease. \n\nSHI BOO YAHH!\nI absolutely loved this experience. Everything was so delicious, and this was probably the best sushi I've had. I'm sure there are plenty others in the world that are better, but as far as I know now. This is sushi heaven!"

You can choose the regular dining experience, sushi bar, or teppanyaki.  The first two probably speak for themselves but not everyone may know what teppanyaki is.  The way the staff at Shibuya explained it to me was that it was similar to the dining experience at Benihana.  Make sense? Ok, great.  \n\nWe chose the regular dining experience.  Shibuya is dimly lit with an intricate interior design that is very unique.  It is somewhat similar to a dining experience in Japan where you are separated by shoji, paper like walls, except here they are vine like cut pieces of wood that run from the floor to the ceiling.  This creates an intimate experience for each dining party.  Tables and seating are very different as well.  Your seat is one long bench.  For a party of two you each get your own bench that are larger than chairs but are only meant for one.  \n\nThe service was outstanding here.  They were attentive and filled drinks for you as you ran low.  \n\nI had the hamachi kama which was broiled yellowtail that was complete with all of the bones still intact.  This could be difficult to eat for a chopstick novice but I was able to manage.  They did offer fork and knife in case I needed to use them.  This dish was good and the experience here was nice.\n\n* I used my open table dining check here without any issues"

I should have stuck to my first though and gone anywhere else.\n\nWe decided to get the Futari Omakase which runs $80 per person. This is the run down on the food:\n1) Cucumber Sunomono (AMUSE) - ya... the Japanese cucumbers covered in MSG is actually a dish and not just given to you like you would get artisan bread at an Italian place.\n2) Yellowtail Sashimi and a King, Snow and Dungeness Crab Salad - The sashimi was about average. It is comparable to something you can get at your average sushi joint around your home. They butchered the yellowtail. The salad was average.\n3) Shibaki Tuna Tartare and the Toban Spiced Albacore- On the albacore they put these... what I can only describe and probably is French's Onion all over the albacore. Although it was decent... there is probably a sushi chef rolling around in his grave. The tartare was bleh.\n4) Lobster and Scallop - this was actually very good and was probably the highlight of the meal\n5) Miso Soup - the Miso Soup was so awkwardly placed in the meal that I was actually getting sick from it. At this point in the meal we had gone through a couple of bottles of cold sake. Then they introduced this hot miso soup... it did not sit well with me the hot and cold liquid. Ewwwww. I felt like sh*t after this. Normally miso soup is one of, if not, the first things you get and not the last courses in the meal. Someone forgot to tell them that.\n6) Nigiri - Average.... same this as the sashimi. average at best.\n7) Dessert Trio (Yuzu Momo Parfait, Choco-Lychee Mousse, Mochi Ice Cream) - by this time I was feeling sick from the cold sake and the hot miso soup. I tried each of the desserts, but didn't care for them. I just needed to sit for a bit.\n\nOverall, this was a horrible experience. We easily dropped a few Benjamins on the meal and sake only to feel kind of sick after all was said and done. I wish I had gone anywhere else that night. No single dish was bad (most were average or better), but it just goes to show you that the intangible things like course order can totally screw up the experience."

My family definitely enjoyed themselves and particularly awestruck by their interior design (being designers themselves, go figure lol).\n\nFOOD:\nWe ordered two Miso Soups ($6.00 for original and add Mushroom +$1.00). Then ordered an array of of nigiri and sushi rolls: Yellowtail, Unagi, Tuna, Scallop, and Oh Toro ($8.00-$13.00 per order); Rolls: Spicy tuna ($12.00) and Dragon Roll ($19.00). Also ordered two warm plates: Spring Chicken Moromi Miso and a Black Cod Miso. Cannot say how the sushi were as I do not enjoy fish as much as my family does, but their Spring Chicken Moromi Miso was quite delicious. Very soft in nature, cooked in a method that gave it a very tender texture and the marinade of moromi miso was delectable!\n\nSERVICE:\nEverything at Vegas at these upscale restaurants are always up to par and always so delicately done. Everyone is so friendly and just very accommodating to every customers needs. The hostess was super gracious since we got there 30 minutes early and needed to wait outside for the restaurant to open. She made sure we were one of the first families to get in. Our waitress was very knowledgeable whenever we had questions about the dishes and the water waiter always made sure to keep our water filled.\n\nAMBIANCE:\nIt's a very chic vibe you walk in, the design aspect was beautiful. I loved their bar area with gradual changing LED lights with these clear box layer on top. Ugh! It's just gorgeous. The way it was done wasn't tacky like most places. The noise level here was also minimal with a rule of no rowdy kids under the age of 5 allowed. I loved it.\n\nDefinitely a place I would suggest to sushi lovers. :)"

We had to check with him about our food, and he was hurry to take away our plates (didn't they want us to order more?)\n\nThe tab wasn't too bad but i will come back for teppanyaki only.  Hopefully the service will be improved next time."

The crunchy shell made the pork very delightful to eat and the tofu on top made the display really pretty. And again being the well done meat eater that i am the wagyu beef was cooked perfectly and served deliciously with the maitake mushrooms and a light soy sauce...\n\nFor what you pay for, i really couldnt ask for more. Its a bit pricey but well worth the fresh fish and delicious warm plates..."

I always get the Black Angus Tenderloin- really tender meat and not too expensive!  Their tempura is also delicious.  \n\nDefinitely make reservations because it can get pretty crowded- especially if there's a MMA fight going on during the weekend."

It's so relaxed and sophisticated, I forgot I was in a casino hotel.\n\nMind you, we didn't have reservations, but the wait was only about 15 minutes. On a SATURDAY night!\n\nI didn't think I'd be able to eat much (I'm vegan), but I mentioned it to the waiter and he was super accommodating. Shibuya has a fairly simple-looking menu, seperated into hot dishes, cold dishes, and rolls. He knew off-hand what had what ingredients in it, and had the chef modify a dish for me. I ate the mushroom salad (5 or 6 different sauteed mushrooms in a savory sauce) and some sea salt edamame. Simple as the meal was, presentation was gorgeous, and the mushrooms were really filling for what the portion looked like. They have THE most extensive sake list I've ever seen/heard of, and the waiter even explained the different processes/types of rice grain/food pairings of whatever we asked about.\n\nGreat experience, I'd go back again. And eat the same exact thing, with a smile on my face."

Service is exceptional as it should be at a top tier Vegas restaurant. \n\nMiso black cod, great choice, but I have literally seen this same dish on over 20 different restaurants menus so I'm expecting a consistent product whether I dined at Nobu, or in this case, Shibuya. \n\nI had a seaweed sampler, which was great. And their shishito peppers were large, and also in a miso glaze, charred to perfection. \n\nNow why 3/5 ?\n\nI ordered Salmon sushi.\nAte the first piece right away, fish was excellent. \nThe rice? Here was my thought process:\n\"Great fish, wait -- is this rice actually hard?\"\nSecond piece of the order - even harder rice. \nI kind of wanted to cancel my meal at that point but my cod was about to arrive. \n\nI haven't EVER experienced hard sushi rice at any Asian restaurant let alone a $$$$ rating spot like Shibuya. \nI told the waiter, he mentioned to manager. Manager apologized. \n\nThey forgot to take it off the bill, so I had to remind them (and they would have definitely forgotten had I not caught it)\n\nI cannot recommend this restaurant without disclaimers regarding having hard sushi rice. \n\nIt's absolutely unacceptable in my opinion and the Chef should have known the quality of the rice was not up to even the most lenient of standards. \n\nA shame, because I was looking forward to coming back again to try their rolls, but after my rice experience here, I probably won't return despite everything else tasting great."

I had blue fin sashimi special that brought me back to my childhood instantly. Freshest and best oyster ever! The lobster roll is a tempura lobster tail, and has the best biggest mouthful of lobster bites you could ever hope for. Just eat here, it's so worth $100 per person It's not even funny. Oh, the service and decor are also top notch, making it worthy of five stars easy!!"

Quite trendy and inviting. \n\nThe selection of sashimi was extensive and his mouth was apparently having a party hehe.  His fave is hamachi but he ordered many other varieties.  \n\nBecause I'm still trying sashimi, I ordered from their 'warm plates'.  The jidori chicken was surprisingly tasty.  I have had my share of sushi restaurant cooked entrees and you really go to these places for the sushi/sashimi so I don't expect much.  This entree was made with love and sympathy for those who enjoy cooked goodies.  \n\nSo the hubs and I both enjoyed this dining experience.  He was happy for me since he can tell that I was elated with my entree decision.\n\nFor the dessert, I chose the berries warabi which was an assortment of mixed berries, ginger creme, green tea-dusted warabi, and soy milk gelato.  Hubs enjoyed the choco lychee that was a chocolate mousse cake, w/lychee vanilla jelly and chocolate soy milk ice cream.\n\nThis place is overall a delight for both sushi/sashimi and/or warm entrees. \n\nIt's a casual environment but the dress code description on MGM's link reads as 'business casual'.  We must have had the acceptable attire because the dress code was the last thing in our vacationing minds.  \n\nReservations are highly recommended but we dined there before the dinner rush so we just walked in."

Fair, quality of salmon not up to par with what I'm used to\n- Poached Lobster and Scallop in UMI butter. Lobster not cooked consistently, some overdone some perfect. Scallop also overdone. UMI butter was very rich, if you like that.\n- Ise Ibe roll: dry dry and more dry. Poached Maine Lobster, Kimchee Aioli and Asparagus inside Soy Paper topped with Tobiko and Crunchy Tempura. Like the idea of the soy paper, but even after dipping w/soy sauce (I don't like to overdip), I thought I was going to choke from the dryness. \n\nStaff was nice, but I won't be back."

They require the majority of the party to have teppanyaki but I was not about to separate my party into two tables. I think that is just ridiculous. Our waitor also seemed pissed when I told him that I wanted a sushi menu. \n\nWe were sat with a family with three children who were very misbehaved and the parents did little to aknoledge this behavior. Our server was awkward and forgot my miso soup. However, the server assistants were great. The teppanyaki chef wasn't very animated nor was his performance interesting to watch. \n\nThe sushi was good. I tried to torro scallion roll which was extremely good. I also really liked the Kho Haku specialty roll. Although these were good, it was nothing I couldn't get at the sushi place I frequent at home."

All i can say is OMG, so worth it!! \n\nThis was seriously some of the best food I've had in my life. I have a love affair with sushi and my bf and I agreed, this was the best sushi we've had yet. The yellowtail sashimi was so unexpectedly flavorful and extremely fresh. The spicy tuna roll was the most generously apportioned spicy tuna roll I've ever had and also the TASTIEST! The show stealer, however,  was the miso BLACK COD... it was just melt in your mouth good. Me and my bf laugh at people who tell stories about food being orgasmic (use to think they were all just fatties), but we have officially changed our ways after being blessed with that fish. It was so delicate and flavorful we gave it the name buttafish.\n\nQuick run down of the other dishes we tasted:\nMiso Salmon- Awesome\nBeef Tenderloin with Truflle Ponzu- Awesome\nSalmon and Avocado Roll- Awesome\nStarter Salad- Rather Subpar\nChilled Soup (can't remember exact name)- Very good but kinda reminded me of birds nest soup from bizarre foods so creeped me out a lil. \n\nI wanted to give this place five stars so bad but..... the drinks were weak and the dessert was blah. Had the lychee martini and it tasted like straight lychee juice. I def didn't plan to pay $12 for no darn lychee juice! From what I've read in other reviews, this is the norm. Dessert was the trio of mochi ice creams and, while not exactly the same as the trader joes variety, it was definitely far from gourmet. \n\nSo four stars for Shibuya for now until they step up their drink game and offer some better dessert on that tasting menu.  \n\nAnd oh yea, while we were falling in love with our buttafish, we look up and see Mr. Lebron James walking on by. Oh wait, he's now walking in and having teppenyaki. Should that then take this rating up to a five star??!! Heck no! Go Lakers!!"

Hopefully we go when we come back in two weeks :) I'd like to try some of their signature rolls."

Of course, if you have a shellfish allergy DO TELL them that so they can make adjustments.\n\nOne of my favorite flavor combinations is yuzu and truffle oil. I'm crave this and actually think of Shibuya each time I want to relive this taste experience.\n\nThe sake pairing is another $55 per person. However, we chose to go with 2 bottles of 300ml sake instead. These 2 bottles took us through the 8 courses. I started with the Demon Slayer and then moved to the Only Daughter ... or some name like that. The meats and rich flavors paired well with the \"Only Daughter.\" \n\nIf you ever want to treat yourself to some amazing sushi and money is no object, come here. It's sooooo good."
