Every time someone would tell me they liked this place, I just laughed inside thinking there's just no way I can take a place with such a name seriously.\nI came back here for a second try, since for my first try I wasn't in the right mind set at 3a.m. to be making any type of accurate judgement call. I just HAD to come back and double check. \n\nI went back here for lunch, and the broth is by far my favorite for pho in Vegas. My faith was in viet noodle bar when they first opened, but they've gone downhill for me over the past year. Annie pho is also popular, but I never enjoyed their pho broth much either.\n\nDON'T STOP, PHO KIM LONG, cuz you da bomb."

            "review": "Seriously, what a disgrace to pho!! If you want less than mediocre pho with awful service, this is definitely the place for you!  \n\nFirst of all, it's in a plaza with like 90 other stores. And they mostly cater to the Asian community. So imagine a tight parking lot filled with Asian drivers. Yeah, you get the picture. \n\nNext, it's always so busy in there. There's no room to wait while you get called for a table, so people are forced outside. Fine if it's spring time, crap if it's in the middle of summer or winter. \n\nThere's no warmth in the service. Idk, maybe it's just me, but if I'm going to sit down at a restaurant, I like the server to chat a little. Even just a smile, a \"how are you?\" would be nice. Nope not here. They hurdle you to the table, take your order, bring your food, then your check. Good luck trying to get someone's attention if you need something extra. On my last visit, it took about 10 minutes to waive someone down so I could put in another order to go. I see this place as a fancy fast food pho joint.\n\nNow the food. The egg rolls are pretty typical. They are fried so you can't really mess those up. Pho broth is on the oily side, like you can see the oil floating at the top of your bowl. Noodles are stuck together like they've been waiting in the bowl for broth to loosen them up. My last visit I ordered seafood pho and it was so gross. The seafood was not fresh at all and had a fishy taste. And the squid tasted like it was on the verge of expiring. Their smoothies are pretty tasty, but stay away from the boba. It's mushy at first and they get hard as it sits in your cold drink.\n\nThe only thing they have going for them is that they are open way late and can cater to the night crowd of Vegas. I don't eat here by choice, only by the choice of others. I'd much rather drive the few blocks down and eat at Kihn Do."

I always order their #14 Rare Steak Noodle Soup, great broth, but I am Mexican so I add a lot of lime and a few squirts of sriracha sauce and some jalapeno slices. But I can't just order only pho. I as well order their crispy eggrolls and crab ragoons, both very delicious and worth looking like a pig in front of everybody.\n\nThey are always busy no matter what, especially weekend nights that u might not find parking in the entire shopping center, it has happened to me before."

The great thing is the option to trade the rice noodles with egg noodles.  Ok, that fits the bill.  Broth is delicious.  I like the fact that it's opened 24/7.  If I ever have the late night munchies and need an Asian soup fix, I will think of this place."

Nice flowers and fish tanks\n- First ever Viet restaurant where a non-Asian was our waiter. Not saying its bad, but I appreciate the diversity! haha\n- Living in SoCal, the pho is pretty darn expensive. But compared to SanJo, it's a bit comparable. $8ish for a reg bowl of pho.\n- Pho was great. Not bland, not too salty. Beef was tender. Pretty comparable to the other Viet restaurants around the area. \n- Average tasting egg rolls. Crispy. pretty thick. \n- They serve food other than Viet. I'd be a bit pessimistic trying it. Pad Thai? I think I'll stick to a Thai restuarant. \n- Seasoned rice and chicken was delicious. Chicken was cooked well and crispy. Excellent flavoring for the rice. You don't need extra sauce to taste any flavor. Perfect! \n- Service was good. No complaints. \n- To call it the best, I'd have to disagree. But the presentation is a lot better than many other Viet restaurants. Great place to introduce your non-Asian friends to Viet cuisine."

I recommend eating here if you're not in the mood for buffets or if you had way too many drinks last night.\n\nThe rating for this place can fluctuate from 3 stars to 4 stars. It really depends on how fresh your bowl of pho comes out. I've had one great experience and one OK experience when visiting Las Vegas. The rule of thumb when eating Pho is to avoid going at night (the soup taste better in the morning / early afternoon).\n\nPho - 3.5 / 5 stars\n\nEgg Rolls are not that great. They're not fresh here.  The restaurant makes them in advance and re-fry them when they receive an order. \n2. 5 / 5 Stars"

Sweet and sour soup and carmelized catfish in clay pot. It is so delicious. I've eaten many Canh Chua Ca Kho and this place makes it the best. My bf who is not a fan of fish, enjoyed it very much. \n\nAnything you order here has good flavor. This is my go to place for asian food when I'm in Vegas.

It was delicious. It was the best bowl of Pho that I had ever in a restaurant. Their Pho has the taste of a homemade pho taste.\n-Portion size for the food was worth it. $9 for a bowl of pho that filled me up. Also, their $4 Thai tea also was worth the money! It was so good and was served in a huge portion. \n-Customer service was absolutely fantastic. They checked up on us periodically. We didn't have to waive them down, or ask them for anything, because they knew absolutely what we needed and wanted. They topped off our water, and even asked to top off my hydroflask. \n\nI absolutely do not have anything to complain about this establishment. This restaurant pho is delicious in taste, and serve in a bowl that will fill you up. The customer service was also great just like their food! \n\nI definitely recommend this place as a go to when you're in Vegas!"

Had the Beef tendon pho, it hit the spot. Aside from the pho, they're ong choy (water spinach) was sauteed well, great sauce. Fried Calamari, was probably the best i have had, I couldnt stop eating it. and the roast duck had a lot of flavor, and you could tell it was made fresh, not re-heated. I can't seem to get a grasp on what type of sauce it was. the salted fish fried rice was also flavor, and you could actually taste the salted fish unlike other places (sam woo). these items are some of the same dishes I get at several asian restaurants just to compare, and the version here are right up there to one of the best i have had. \n\nJust to comment on people talking about service and such, I don't mean to be harsh, or offend the asian culture, because I consider myself asian myself. But the bad service? first these types of places is not a pf changs or a pei wei. they're not here to ask you how your day is going. they're just not, some of them don't even speak english. yes when they bring out the food to you, sometimes they rush, or kind of pack all the dishes on the table, looking like they slam the plates on it., theyre a little rough and maybe your oolong tea spills a little from your cup. you know what thats a sign of? that it's authentic. Some of the best places I have eaten at in California were like this. actually my favorite place back home, was like this, won't exactly strike you as fine dining and not the most polite servers but best food hands down. I once went to a place in San Francisco, where you had to go down they're basement to go to the bathroom, a little scary, but what shocked me more was how good they're food was"

Its like the hangout for people that just went clubbing.  Girls stumble in drunk in short skirts and guys chatting about girls drunk in short skirts.\n\nService is very good. The Pho in my opinion are pretty good as well.  Sorry I can't really put much info on the menu bcause I've always ordered by numbers in a Pho Restaurant. But all the Pho are pretty Pho'king good.

I've gone to this restaurant and all those times we were able to do split checks and today they said they have never done spilt checks.\n\nThe guy charges my card without my consent and I see he charged me the whole bill when i asked him I was only going to pay for certain entrees and he said that it is IMPOSSIBLE to do my request. So I tell him to VOID the transaction and so my other friend comes to pay for it and we just all give her cash. I come home to check my bank statement and see that THEY HAVE BILLED ME FOR THE MEAL AS WELL! Im going to wait a few days to see if he really did void my transaction, but this is ridiculous! Usually when I void my order it shows in my bank statement right away.\n\nSo if you're coming in a big group, make sure everyone has cash because this place does not accept split checks! Better yet go elsewhere!\n\nFood quality is mehhh as well. Usually I LOVE pho and can eat the whole bowl but it just did not satisfy me as much as other restaurants. I will never come back to this place again. \n\nI will though if they don't give me my money back!! So frustrating!!!"

Everyone has heard of it. Its like an Asian mecca, every girl I meet goes here and late night its a stripper haven. One time I was waiting on Pho to go and a girl dropped a dub in front of me. My girl was sitting on my lap and she saw it first. Shes from Vegas so instead of doing something kind, she tapped me and let me be the moral judge (sorry XTI but we all know u aint readin this...) anyway, I grabbed it  and tapped the girl. She turned around and it was a stripper from my work in SF. (I actually got fired because of her and her amazing butt) We laughed embarassingly and said hi. After exchanging pleasantries I mentioned my life and nodded at the guamanian in my lap and the convo halted (still kicking myself for thatttt) Point is, this place holds it down and word spreads.

We were also seated immediately. We all sat down, thought about what we wanted to order... 10 minutes had gone by after we were seated and no one came up to us to ask us what we wanted to drink. A couple of minutes later, an older gentleman took our orders. My friend and I both ordered Pho Dat Biet (special combination tender beef noodle soup, $8.75), my boyfriend ordered half of the Ga Chien Gion (deep fried chicken with fried garlic, $13.95 for half chicken), and my other friend ordered Com Chien Tom (shrimp fried rice, $11.50). \n\nHere came the most disappointing part. I'm not exaggerating when I say that 30 minutes had literally gone by before the first dish came out, and that was my boyfriend's deep fried chicken dish. I thought that this dish was pretty good. It wasn't too salty and I loved the fried garlic. Do note that this dish didn't come with rice so you would need to order it on the side. At this point, I'm starting to look around the room hoping to catch the attention of the workers to see if they had brought out our dishes. 5 minutes after the fried chicken came out, both of the Pho Dat Biet came out. Honestly, I didn't think that it was too good. The broth wasn't anything spectacular and for the \"special\" bowl of Pho that we ordered, there was barely any beef, tripe, tendon, and all the other components that goes in the special. \n\nAt this point, my other friend who had ordered such a simple dish of fried rice STILL has not received has order. We started trying to track down the employees and finally managed to spoke to one about how we haven't received the last dish of fried rice. There was a couple who was sitting nearby us, who were seated way after we were seated and had managed to receive their food order BEFORE we even got ours! And how is it that the fried rice would be the last dish to come out? Makes no sense to me.... So about 10 minutes after both of the Pho dishes came out, my friend's fried rice finally came out. It didn't look too appealing either... He also mentioned that some of the parts in his fried rice were cold and not warm at all...\n\nI don't know what happened with our order honestly. Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours, which is great for people who want to grab a late meal after EDC, clubbing, etc ;]. Since Vegas is the city that never sleeps, I'm sure many people there appreciate how late Pho Kim Long is opened. It's possible that at night, they don't have as many cooks in the kitchen or they simply forgot our order... who knows! I most likely wouldn't visit Pho Kim Long to eat again unless I desperately needed some soup or Pho late at night!"

I selected #28, Hu Tieu (seafood pho); got egg noodles instead of the rice noodles that I requested. Broth was interesting as it had a strong ginger finish but that didn't make it good. The ingredients were WAY over-cooked to the point that I thought the squid were random pieces of wonton that had fallen into the pot, completely devoid of flavour and with a splatty texture. Shrimp were pink and white curly cues pared from superball material and the cheapy sort, very small sans tail. The sliced jalepe\u00f1os musta been prepped last week as they were brown around the edges and flaccid.\n\nLeft without the usual \"Pho FUPA\" that I've come to associate with consuming a bowl full of love due the small serving size and sub-par ingredients.\n\nThere are heaps of better Pho joints in Vegas- go to one of them."

Even for not walking in here for a month or so, they still remember who I am and what I love to order!\n\nSuper friendly and fast service. The servers always know that I like to order the pan-fried noodles, orange chicken, salt n pepper pork chops, steam rice and a side of the pho broth!!! Like I said, my favorite restaurant away from home (San Francisco). \n\nIt's a very clean and modern decor inside the restaurant. Nothing that you can complain about, especially I'm so used to the restaurants in the Chinatown area in San Francisco - this place seems upscale! On the side note, I have been to a few other chinese restaurants here in LV, but haven't found a place that beats Pho Kim Long. I think they beat all other competition since they are open 24hrs a day! Got that hangover, no problem have some pho and a coconut and rest it off... LOL \n\nThis is a short taxi cab ride away if you are staying on the strip, and if you have a rental car, super easy to get to! Don't be surprise to see the security guard at the door during late night hours...lol he's super friendly and cool once you get to converse with him a few times going there!"

Although after sitting down no one came to our table for a really long time until we clearly made hand signals for someone to come and take our order. The soup was good I suppose, but not amazing. I figured it was Vegas and you get what you get in a tourist city. The one thing that bugged me was that they charge you $1 if you want your rare steak on the side...NOT EXTRA just on the side which didn't make sense to me. I ordered the beef balls pho and the menu said it was $1 for an additional topping so I asked for rare steak on the side (not knowing there was an additional charge for having the meat on the side in the first place) It was a regular bowl and when the bill came it was $10 dollars. In the world of Pho that's pretty pricey for a small bowl. I mean this place looks a little more \"nice\" then regular pho joints, but it definitely wasn't upscale. It just looked like a fast pace late night pho restaurant."

Having been to one other Pho restaurant not too far from here which wasn't great.  The place had an updated interior and had lots of people coming in to eat.  Ordered my usual of Pho Dac Biet, basically all kinds of yummy tendon and tripe in it.   Strangely I think this was the best meal I had all weekend.  \n\nOne of my friends freaked out that he had tripe in his Pho when he ordered Tai Chin.  Really funny, cause I knew right away when he was asking wtf that meat in his bowl was.  He asked to have the problem fixed and they easily made it right.  From what i know, there are more mediocre or flat out horrible Pho restaurants in Las Vegas.  I can safely say that this was a pleasant departure from the mediocre."

At pho kim long the soup is a bit oily you can definitely see the bubbles floating around. The soup comes hot so be careful, it comes hot for a reason because the thin slices of meat have to cook in the soup. The regular size is more then enough for me so portions are good.\n\nEgg rolls: 2/5  I used to like their egg rolls until they decided to down size. Their egg rolls used to be fat and thick but ever since they changed their recipe they're friend super small and thin. The size of a lumpia basically, and they give you like 1 slice of lettuce. Everyone knows you wrap the egg roll inside the lettuce and dip it in that fish sauce they give you. \n\nService: 1/5 Even if your belligerently drunk service should still matter. This place is very fast paced and when your drunk you just want things to slow down at that point. The waiters are very pushy and they rush the heck out of you. Once you order and they bring your food out forget trying to get their attention later. Flagging down a waiter there just to get your check is a mission there."

(SO EMBARRASSED)\n\nbut i do recommend giving this place a try and you can be the judge yourself."

If you come in and theres a wait, you will not get a wait-time. Her response is pretty much we will seat you when we seat you - first come first serve. If a restaurant is busy thats great, however it would be nice to let your customers know if its going to be 5mins or an hour. I witnessed another guest waiting prior to me walked outside for a smoke or whatever and when he came back he asked how much longer the host told him she called his name and he got skip...Well if you wouldve told him how long he would've known to stay inside..thats where the lack of communication needs to be fixed. The whole first come first serve is bs. They will seat a bigger group before you if they need to. When it was time for my friends and I to get seated, the host \"pointed\" to the table for us to sit at, not walk us to the table- pointed. Okay, Sure.. Walking to the table another employee(who an earlier guest asked him how long the wait is said he didn't work at the restaurant- mind you this guy was wearing a \"Pho Kim Long\" shirt! LOL hmm.. WTF?!) anyways this guy stops us and told us not to sit at the table then the host saw us standing around and told us to sit.. its fine just sit.. its was back and forth for a minute. I finally just sat myself at an open table bc this was just beyond bad. So we sat waitress takes our order ( doesn't write anything down) order comes out and of course one of the dish was wrong, we told the a lady (the owner?) she came back with the right order she was very nice (thats the one star) the food was good (second star)UNTIL my sisters Pho had a bug in it (extra protein?) and my pho had a good size piece of plastic vinyl thing in it. So that completely ended our meals :)"

The spring rolls were so small and just most of the meals served are small. My girlfriend ordered a large bowl of pho and it was small! \nSecondly, my vermicelli I ordered was very greasy and I managed just to eat a quarter of it before I had to discard it. \nLastly, customer service is mediocre; could've been more better.

But getting down to the soup the Pho is what you'd expect from a Chinatown restaurant: a gianormous serving size, lots of beef, tripe and other goodies and that Vietnamese home-cooked taste. I can't comment on some of the other offerings although when it comes to variety of Pho you can spend a few min sifting through plenty of choices on the menu or just call it as you like since it is (for the most part) made to order.\nThe food is 4 stars but with the disclaimer to just not set your expectations too high with regards to the service."

One of the things that amazes me with this place is it is constantly upgrading subtle things within the restaurant the staff seamed happy for years but lately the natives are restless...  The staff almost seems stressed which I can understand because they have become too busy.   You can no longer walk in at anytime and sit down, they have a security guard at the door checking you in and taking you to the table.  The problem with this is he is not trained, at all.  We walked in and were ignored until another couple walked in and I spoke up and said \"oh we were next\"  he replied \"oh\"  I said \"do you have a check in list?\" he said \"ahh...\" I said \"why don't you write our names on that and keep track of all the people? :)\"  I am never mean and rarely rude or brash, this was getting close to my breaking point.\n\nSo anyhow he seats us and man things happen fast from there it has always been fast but this was crazy fast.  Kind of stressed me out a little bit!  No greeting from the waiter just \"are you ready to order?\" \"No but we will have a hot tea and a water\" \"ok be back\"  he comes backs and we felt we needed to be ready at this point, we ordered and the food was being served within minutes.   So a plus for fast food and a minus for somewhat unregarded service.\n\nI had the very tame but oh so good Charbroiled Pork & Egg Roll with Rice Vermicelli (a cool salad perfect for 112 degree weather that evening (boy we are having a hot summer! :() My pork was perfectly done chared to perfection, my egg rolls were also perfectly done (but you can't really mess that one up right) my salad was fresh and my sauce was good as usual, however my noodles were stuck together and really hard to get apart to eat and mix into the rest of my dish.  I think this is a sad casualty of a really big and really busy place at this point. \n\nI am totally ok with hardcore asian waiters/restaurants and what not but this place has TONS of young, hip and many races and no longer has the excuse of \"we are an old school chinese restaurant\".  You want your favorite places to get busy but not so busy they lose touch with what and who got them busy to begin with...\n\nSo I am giving stars for my food taking away for my stuck together noodles and taking away as well for the kind of crappy service from the front and the wait staff.  I will be back and will write about my next experience.  I hope this place can find the happy medium for making big bucks but remembering why and who you are making those big bucks from..."

After a quick car ride, we were here. \n\n24 hours is always a good sign to me because it means two things - the food is tasty, and it's probably not too pricey.  We were seated quickly and were asked if we knew what we wanted to order after a few minutes. Because I hadn't been there before, I needed more time to check out the extensive menu. \n\nPad Thai is kryptonite for me. I absolutely can't pass it up. The spicier, the better. I ordered the chicken pad thai and asked for it to be as spicy as possible. The waiter looked nervous when I said I really did want it as spicy as possible. I want my food to be \"sinus clearing spicy\" every time. Delicious. Beau ordered a beef pho and the Thai Tea.\n\nThe waiter brought me a fork and a spoon and Beau... nothing. I didn't catch what Beau meant when he said he liked how the waiter assumed he didn't need a fork and spoon but I did, until I thought about it the next day. Maybe white people tend to not know how to use chopsticks? I don't know, but I know how, and I obviously wasn't offended, so the fork and spoon were left untouched. \n\nThe waiter brought out our food fairly quickly and was giving me a look like they might need an EMT soon due to the spiciness of the food. I was actually a little scared based on how the waiter was acting. I took a bite.... MILD, borderline not spicy. Pssssh. Typical. Maybe it's because a girl, but regardless of what type of restaurant I'm at, when I order \"spiciest you can possibly make the dish\" apparently the waiters think I can't handle myself and it comes out mild. Wah. I doused my plate in chili sauce and Sriracha sauce to the point of ridiculousness. Perfect. The Pad Thai was killer and as usual eating things that aren't cut up, I'm sure I made a fool of myself trying to get it into my mouth semi-daintily. \n\nI liked that the waiters were on top of their stuff. My water glass was never left unfilled. One waiter even said he read my mind as he filled up my glass, and he was actually ahead of me. That's how it's supposed to be so not only was the food phenomenal, the service was great too.\n\nBeau made a fantastic choice bringing me here and I would gladly go out of my way to eat here again."

At the end of the day, they're not here to make friends and will probably throw you under the bus."

Little more expensive than other nearby places that are open late as well and equally if not more tasty. Also has smelled a bit funny in there when I take-out latenight boba (not the typical pho joint smell). Atmosphere is nicer than the majority of pho places in town. Kind of hip, swanky, dim lighting. Good for a date."

We visited one evening with a friend when our first choice in Chinatown had an hour wait. I should have trusted the instinct of not going to your last choice.\n\nWe ordered the Salt and Pepper Calamari to start. The batter was strange and oily, but still pretty tasty with the chopped chilies, garlic, and etc. Plus, the dipping sauce was good. Ruben ordered the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (charbroiled pork and egg roll with rice vermicelli noodles). The pork was flavorful, but the dish as a whole was not very cohesive and bland. I ordered the Drunken Noodles with the Vegetarian option. I really like the flat, thick rice noodles and lots of fresh vegetables, so I was immediately drawn to this dish, however, it lacked in flavor and depth. A bit of Sriracha sauce saved it toward the end, but any great dish wouldn't have to rely on a table condiment. Our friend, Juan, ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and it was okay.\n\nNeedless to say, I didn't enjoy the meal very much. The highlight was the Calamari and still, that was no where close to being the best calamari dish I've eaten. Obviously, I didn't try Pho and perhaps that may be something they do really well? I wouldn't count on it since everything else was so disappointing. Service was okay, no complaints. Anyway, there are so many other spots in town serving up better Thai food, Vietnamese food, and whatever else they're serving here and just steps away."

There was about 5 tablespoons of oil at the bottom of the plate. Too greasy for me. \n\nThe orange chicken looks delicious until you try to eat it. Some of the pieces of chicken had a really consistency. It's hard to describe. I'm scared it wasn't chicken at all. It was like no chicken I've ever had. Maybe it was old or frost bitten. The texture was not chicken. I could not get my around eating it at all. \n\nRice. How do you mess up rice?  The white rice was over cooked and somewhat mushy. The brown rice was undercooked and hard. \n\nService was initially very fast but we had to wait forever for our bill.   I was there on a Saturday night around 12a and the wait was short. \n\nWith all the places Vegas has to offer. I would never go back to this dump."

I asked one of the random servers to take it back after waiting over five minutes for someone to come check and see if I was satisfied.  I asked for a freshly prepared rice dish and again  I got mushy fried rice!   I stood up and walked to the cashier, the cashier is the manager, well this m*t*h*e*r%^&*#$, told me how this is how  traditional fried rice is made, and that this is the way they make the rice, and that he wasn't my servant, a comment he made after I told him how the customer is always right .  I proceeded to tell him how it wasn't traditional fried rice and that I wasn't  going to eat it or pay for something that I haven't eaten, he refused to give me my money back and told me to dispute it with my bank.  I came back to my table and the security guard asked me to step outside, I was embarrassed, cold, and my girl was left hungry.   I was treated like a drunk fool, and I wasn't even drunk.  The security guard tried to mediate the situation having me and my girl wait outside in the cold while he would go inside and talk to Ken the manager.  Well, the guard told me that Ken didn't want to deal with the situation anymore and that he was just going to make the fried rice (to go) one more time and that he was done bartering with me. \n\np.s.  food is overpriced and their quality doesn't match, spend your money elsewhere."

They get your food out pretty quickly but refills are slow moving, particulaly with water.  I start singing loudly when I have to wait more than five minutes and they show up pretty quickly after that.  After they drop your food off, they are gone for a good ten minutes.  \n\nThat previous reviewer isn't kidding - this place is hopping ALL the time!  You sometimes may have to wait a few minutes to get seated... rarely because there's a line but because the servers are booking it all over the place\n\nThe food is NOT spicy enough for me, generally.

I like noodle in my soup. I didn't like one of the greens they used. It had a light minty taste, but wasn't mint. Whatever it was (I think they also brought it out on the side for us to add into our soups), it distracted me in a bad way. The leaves look like basil, but definitely aren't basil. Anyway, if it wasn't for that, I think I would have become a bigger fan of Pho than I currently am. The meat was alright. Tasted too bland. But again, this was my first Pho experience.

I guess it's one of those places where food is decent but service is lacking - they take their time. My friend and I walk up to the counter and was greeted by a hostess. We wanted to order to go and she took our order, said it would take 15-20 minutes. Sure, it's a Sunday evening, restaurant wasn't full but it was getting there. This was 9:10pm. \n\n9:40pm rolls around. We've seen other people who ordered after us with orders fulfilled. So, we walk up to the counter further in where the register is at and talk to the guy behind the register who is clearly prepping orders to go and picking up phone orders. He says our order isn't in there; He can't find it. I clarified the hostess took down our order over half an hour ago, he calls her over, she says something in Vietnamese that, by the tone of it, she admitted she totally forgot. STRIKE 1. He apologizes to us and takes our order. which were repeated to him (once by my friend, second time by me just to make sure he has it), said it would be out in 10-15 minutes. Fine, I paid, wait again. \n\nHe walks over to hand us the food himself, again apologizing. We feel better, even though we were really hungry, as we felt he knew we deserved better service. We then check the food and there's an order missing, and a missing side rice. Checked the bag and we couldn't find the order receipt. We approach him and he says we didn't order what we claim are missing. He prints out our order receipt and shows us. Clearly, he didn't add them in. STRIKE 2. We make another payment.\n\nIt was really hard to enjoy the food after dealing with this kind of service but by this time I was so hungry I ate up the whole thing. Food was decent, but I can't say it was great. I will make an effort to give this restaurant another chance and hopefully I can follow up to this with a more positive review and not a Strike 3. Nonetheless, It was a very disappointing night."

I felt like I was being ripped off. I actually left angry because I could have gone to Saigon 8 like I originally wanted to."

The food is pretty mediocre so I don't really know what the hype is about or why they have been able to draw such a crowd. The last time I was here last year, I thought the food was still alright. But, this time it really wasn't anything exceptional and I had wished I just ate somewhere else after. I think my main issues is the poor customer service. Anytime if I ask a question or if we're low on the items at the table, they usually give me a dirty look and make it seem that I'm such an annoyance to them. I think the last straw for me was when my dad was asking about a dish and the guy was like if you're so worried about it then don't eat it. Ridiculously rude. Not even good enough food to even come off with poor customer service."

The boy ordered a combination bowl that had rice, egg rolls, veggies and sauce and was very delicious.  I ordered the duck noodle soup which had a flavorful broth and lots of good stuff in it.  The duck was very good and crispy.  We also ordered a long bean dish with ground pork.  This was my favorite thing by far.

With that being my family's background, it is hard to eat at some places and not say that one of my parents could make it better.\n\nIt has been forever since I went to a restaurant with the intention of getting pho. I came here with a group of friends to celebrate one of them getting a promotion. None of us ordered from the Vietnamese menu. It is probably for the best, because I am unforgiving most of the time. \n\nInstead we got items off of the Chinese menu and did it family style. The eggrolls and crab rangoons are nothing special. I would rather skip the appetizers and just order more entree dishes. The Pepper Beef is generous and comes with a beautiful array of broccoli. Mongolian Beef was tender and had a decent flavor to it, but it lacked the kick. Kung Pao Chicken had me searching out for the hot peppers to make up for the previous dish. The Singapore Noodles came in a mountain sized portion and had a subtle curry flavor to it. The stand out dish was the Honey Garlic Porkchops. They are phenomenal. Large pieces of boneless and bone in meat fried crisp, tossed in a lightly sweet sauce, and topped with fried chopped garlic. I was grabbing piece after piece.\n\nNot only is Pho Kim Long a place to sooth your hangover. It is a place to get it started. With a decent selection of mainly imported Asian beers and a few common domestics, you can begin the party. Add in some cold sake to do sake bombs and you have a party. With 2 apps, five entrees, and three rounds of drinks we paid $120. It is a deal."

Apparently they do not sell tripe there (said the waitress). But they did make up for it by giving us generous portions of brisket and additionally included meatballs (bo vien) which I typically do not see in combination pho at other restaurants. The broth was flavorful and not too oily so that was also a plus. But I do believe a bowl of pho for about $9 is on the expensive side. All in all I would give their pho 3.5 stars. \n- Spring rolls: I will post a picture of their spring rolls. They were composed of minimal elements for high-dollar. $5.50 for 2 spring rolls is super pricey in my book, especially because these spring rolls were far from anything special. Rice noodles, shredded lettuce, pork, and shrimp wrapped in rice paper (so basic!). They didn't even bother to add bean sprouts, mint leaves, or green onion to enhance the flavors. Also, their dipping sauce was a little too heavy on the peanut-side (some don't mind it but I prefer an equal balance). Never ordering spring rolls from them again (unless they actually read this post and start making better spring rolls and sauce). \n\nService: They took the pho (with plastic) and an order of spring rolls off our bill which was nice - but is expected when serving non-edible components in your food. When we notified our waitress about the plastic in my fiends bowl of pho, she quickly took it away and had another combination pho delivered to us pronto. The service is what saved this place from getting only 1-star. \n\nDecor: Pretty modern but tries to keep an authentic Asian feel with the bonsai trees and fish tanks. \n\nI suppose this place had a decent rep because it's open 24-hours and the name is catchy. I wanted to like this place but all-in-all, my experience was not one to bring me back. I can get better pho for cheaper at plenty of other places. Maybe if I was in desperate need of pho at a weird time of the night, I might settle for Pho Kim Long... Until then, Yelpers beware."

I don't like it when place don't rinse the starch off their noodles and makes the broth cloudy, none of that here. Good portions of noodle and meat, yes! Also, no crazy obvious msg taste, here we go baby! Path to recovering so you can go hard again!\n\nI used to take good pho for granted, but having experienced some bad ones lately, I really appreciate those that stay true to the craft! \n\nLOCATION: If you are staying around the wynn/venetian side of the strip, you just go right across spring mountain a few blocks and you are in chinatown, not too far of a drive to get some tasty vietnamese beef broth in your system."

I told the server that we JUST ordered and he was like \"yeah it comes out quick!\" Umm no, the server we ordered from was still punching in the order on their POS.\n\nThe boba in their drinks tends to be too hard/chewy, like it wasn't soaked long enough. The pho did not have that pungent aroma that I've experienced at other places, and the service the times I've been there have not been the greatest. The last time I went, the herbs/sprouts that came with the pho were not the freshest and even brown/wilting.\n\nWhy come here? Convenience. And a bowl of pho in the wee hours tends to \"hit the spot\"."

I got the chicken pho & @ first glance, it lacked EVERYTHING. I guess l get too spoiled living in Orange County, California with quality fresh cheap authentic pho on every corner.\n\nThey skimped on ALL veggies especially scallions, culantro, thai basil, & white onion. Broth was below average. At least I had the option to choose big rice noodles after I requested it. The measly dry chicken BITS were floating around in the murky water. At other places, when you order chicken pho, these are the questions the waiter would ask you (but this place didn't):\n\n-What bowl size?\n-What noodle size?\n-White or dark meat?\n-Do you want chicken skin on your meat?\n-Do you want gizzards? (Liver, Coagulated blood, heart, eggs, etc.)\n\nHOISIN SAUCE!!! Watered down, much? It was runny, light brown, and extra salty-like a teriyaki sauce! How can you even manage to eff that up too? Wow...\n\nOpt for elsewhere, please. We made the mistake of choosing that place because later after some driving around, we saw plenty of other pho restaurants on the same street. Cheaper too, albeit. Darnit-we originally were supposed to eat @ Kinh Do because they supposedly have better reviews..."

The broth and noodles were right on point with its flavor and wasn't too bland or strong like at some other spots. The meats were good, except for the meatballs which had a weird taste to it. \n\nThis is a fairly large restaurant and probably the biggest pho place I've seen.

Funny thing is there is also a \"Pho Kim Long\" where we are from, so we thought we'd give this place a chance. Hopped into a cab and asked the cab driver himself if he had a favorite Pho place. And right off the bat he named this place! \n\nThe restaurant itself is bigger than most pho restaurants I've been to, and definitely the NICEST looking. I'm used to cheap restaurants that look a bit dirty inside. This place actually has ambiance. Service wasn't too shabby as well, and honestly don't know if it was because I was super hungry (and slightly hungover) but I could say this was the best pho I've ever eaten... surprised it was in Vegas! Even my sister's vermicelli salad looked bomb and perfectly proportioned. Be warned as they only have one size and no \"larges\" for you hungry hippos. Or maybe they do, but it's not listed on the menu.\n\nDefinitely should open a location on the strip and they'd make so much money.

There's also house made sauces and spicy pepper sauces like Sriracha. \n\nAnd I guess you need to go stupid early, because A) Parking is a Nightmare and B) there's a 6 p.m. dinner rush which means you will be smushed in the doorway with a bunch of grumpy people for an hour. \n\nIt's also open 24 hours and located within Las Vegas's China Town. \n\nAll in all...I'm not recommending this place if you want good Pho or if you're not asian? I totally don't understand the reviews. Because apparently the clueless white folks are getting the crappy scraps or something."

I guess you can say it doesn't sound very nice to say, but the food here is my favorite Vietnamese cuisine. I'm not a huge fan of the pho but I'm a very big fan of their vermicelli noodle bowls! It's the perfect amount of food for someone with a middle sized appetite. They're open late night so if you're out on the strip with your friends or are looking for a late night snack (hardly the size for a snack), Mr. Pho Kim Long is your best bet to satisfy your Vietnamese craving.\n\nThe service isn't super because of the lack of personality their staff has but they bring your food out fairly quick. Does one base service on how quick you get to eat or how pleasant they make your visit? I say it depends on both but lucky for Pho Kim Long, their service is very fast and consistent.  It wouldn't hurt the staff to crack a smile or two, crack a joke, or laugh even. They don't have a problem splitting your checks as long as they get their money.  The atmosphere is very traditionally Asian and being of Asian descent, it doesn't do much for me.  In other words, you wont catch me with my iPhone in hand snapping shots like some tourist or something. Maybe, the food for Yelp but that's all ;)\n\nNever had a problem customer service-wise, always accommodated the big groups of friends I go everywhere with, and doesn't take log to bring what you ask for. That's a big thing for me when the server takes the detour to bring you something you've asked for. And having to ask for it twice really peeves me but as busy and as impersonable as their staff is, they go and get what you ask for right away. Maybe to get you to go faster? If I wanted to be In -n- Out of a joint, I'd go get a burger! Hahaha! Go for the pork vermicelli, add the sauce they give you with some of the oyster (brown) sauce and a bit of the hot sauce and you'll be good! Have some fun saying the restaurant when suggesting to eat here! Happy eating! :)"

The broth was even more amazing, and the won tons themselves were incredible!!

The Pho i got was amazing.  I loved adding the bean sprouts and other things they brought to the table for us to it, I especially loved adding the different sauces they  had at the table (mostly hot sauce was what i added since I'm sucker for spiciness). It was very filling and very delicious, i couldn't even finish it all and had to take it home!  The only food i didn't like was the spring rolls I think is what they were.  My friends had ordered them before I got to the restaurant so I didn't have a say in it, but seafood is not my thing and these had shrimp in them I believe so that pretty much killed it for me on them. Plus the dipping sauce was some kind of peanut based sauce......I've had other peanut based sauces at other places which I've liked, but this one was just too thick for my liking.  \n\nOtherwise I love this place and will definitely have to make it a priority to go here when I visit friends in Las Vegas."

I feel if a restaurant can't keep the floors, or bathrooms clean then the kitchen is not clean.  The Fish tanks were just awfully dirty.  Many people who need some place to eat at night go here. I would consider it drunk food since at night most every customer has been drinking and there is lots of noise."

Just about every trip to Vegas, We have made countless  stops here at Pho Kim Long, Not because their food is good( not when a diner compares the quanlity and quantity with a more populous Vietnamese community like Westminster CA, San Jose CA, or Houston TX...Their pho's taste seems ok but the size is like a small bowl in CA and is far away from being on the top notch. \nOnce in Vegas, when it comes to Vietnamese food, a diner does not have many choices. Even though there are better choices now( in compare with a few years back, thanks to the competition.)\nBut what really gets me to Stand Up:) and create a Yelp account to \"award\" the first so call negative review for Pho Kim Lonng is that I had a bad diarrhea in Vegas and really need a hot bowl of beef congee with green onions and ginger in it to wash down two caplets of loperamide HCL 2mg. So my wife called and ordered two bowls of the beef congee for me and for her too, since we were staying in a hotel room. \nBeing so exhausted at 3am, I had to drive up there to pick up the food. Ohh my God!!! When I opened it there was literally Almost noooooo meat! ( something My body really need to digest for recovery). When I said Almost it means that there was just a few very tiny pieces floating up and down to the point that I would rather don't see them so my mind can do a better job of persuading the so disappointed stomach that they have forgotten to put the meat in!\nI have done with my duty as a Yelp reviewer. There are not only Vietnamse diners but also many Americans and others. I wish the best for the consumers' community and hope that as a diner, you will make the best choice for yourself."

We were like oh its 137 degrees outside, a nice watermelon, or pineapple, or strawberry drink sounds amazing and refreshing, when we got it we all literally took one sip and didn't drink it after that.  Oh but they looked like they could glow in the dark, i guess that's kinda cool? \n\nOn top of that the pho took forever to come, maybe they forgot, but the ones who ordered rice plates pretty much finished it before the pho even came.  Pho should take no more than a few minutes to come out, not over 10 minutes.  I must say it's understandable for the ones including myself to finish our rice plates first because portion wise they were probably made for babies. I had one tiny porkchop and some rice, usually at Vietnamese restaurants you're not able to see the bottom of your plate because its filled with food, but this plate was very bare.  \n\nBottomline: food took forever, drinks sucked, and for 5 guys the bill came out to $80.

I do enjoy the calamari with fried garlic and jalape\u00f1os as this fresh preparation style is not seen elsewhere. Their vermicelli noodle bowl is pretty standard with other locations and won't disappoint. Spring rolls aren't too bad either. \n\nThey give you a filled water cup right away upon seated. They don't have pots of tea available; just a cup of hot water and a tea bag was presented upon ordering. Apparently they don't do that here, which is weird for this type of cuisine.

Service counts, and because its never been stellar per say (the waiters are quick but not friendly), any small change (like to speed lets say) can turn a great place, to just an ok place.  One thing I noticed was the overall disconnect from the workers and front of the house management.  The place wasn't that busy and we still had to put our name on a list to be seated for some reason.  In the past this place would be packed to the gills and we would be seated right away, no problem.  Tonight we waited to be seated for 15 minutes even when it was relatively empty.  This seemed to make the workers who were standing around looking helpless and angry.  At one point I could see them pointing and talking about the host, and probably not in a good way.  Once we did get seated the food did take a little bit longer to come out mostly, I believe, because they were busy talking about the host.  \n When the food did come it was great as usual, and in all truth is actually one of Vegas's great late night eats.  Now I understand you have to take a place based on what it is, and appreciate that.  What is Pho Kim Long?  Well it's great Pho when you're out late on a Vegas night.  If you keep that in the forefront of your mind, you will enjoy it and forget about its faults.   However if you are taking this eating establishment as a whole, as I am trying to right now, then its shortcomings become apparent.  The truth is Vegas does have a ton of Pho restaurants some with better tasting Pho, and others with better service.  In the end you can call Pho Kim Long average with room for improvement, and you would be fair in saying that.   Will I go back again most defiantly, but I will go there with the understanding that \"it is what it is\"."

Since chicken pho isn't all that popular most places simply have it as an after-thought. At PKL it is done well with a very good broth.\n\nThey must be doing something right to always be as busy as they are, but unless it 3am and you just got out of the club, I still think there are better options in the vicinity."

Some waiters are a little rude, but they get the job done.\n\nI usually order the rare beef and well done flank pho. They give a ton of meat. The small size is the perfect portion for me - big enough to warm me up inside and cure any headaches, but not too big where I feel like throwing it all up along with the alcohol I had the previous night.\n\nThey have many other options in addition to pho. A lot of Chinese dishes served family style. Sometimes I crave rice when I drink, so this place really covers all my drunk munchies."

Our server tended to our requests in a timely manner and did what we asked. The food came out on time, too. However, the quality of the food was mediocre at best.\n\nI started with the fried calamari. It was drenched in salt. All I could taste was salt. I was a little \"salty\" when they did this. The plate also had shells of fried batter that did not have calamari. In fact, half of the plate was fried calamari and the other half was fried batter. This plate is probably for people who REALLY enjoy salty foods and have a small craving for calamari.\n\nNow, onto the entree, the pho. I ordered the Pho Tai (rare thinly cut beef) Bo Vien (meat balls). The broth and noodles were average; they did not have me jumping out of my seat because it was delicious nor did it have me throwing up because it was awful. The Tai, on the other hand, was pretty good. It was what I expected it to be, easy to chew and flavorful with the hoisin and Sriracha sauces. I wish I could say the same about the Bo Vien. They were the worst meat balls I have ever had at a vietnamese restaurant. I ate one meat ball and put the rest of the meat balls on a separate dish to be thrown out later. It seemed like the meat was processed with plastic. It had no consistency and quickly broke in your mouth without even chewing. It was absolutely disgusting.\n\nAs a final thought, I think you would be best trying something else other than the Pho Bo Vien."

Those guys ALWAYS used to take me to the best pho spots, so I'm no pho newbie.\n\nI decided to try out Pho Kim Long with one of my boys right before he got married in Vegas, because it was quick, inexpensive, and let's face it, the name of the restaurant is awesome! Funny as hell!\n\nAfter taking some quick Myspace pics by the sign outside, we ventured in the restaurant and ordered our food. My homie ordered Pho Dac Biet, and I ordered Pho Tai, which is my favorite because I love the thin, rare, red slices of steak (tai) that they throw on top of your steaming soup with hot rice noodles. \n\nAs we waited for our food, I did my standard Vietnamese restaurant ritual of thoroughly wiping down my chopsticks and little condiment dishes with hot tea and napkins. You can never be too careful, especially since Pho Kim Long is located conveniently next to a platform shoes store for strippers.\n\nThe service was pretty good, I appreciated the fact that the waiter made an extra effort to hold our pho bowls on the outside! =) I've been to pho places before where they grab the bowl with their thumb on top, and the other fingers below the bowl... but I hate that, cause the soup splashes around, and the waiter's thumb often times goes into the soup! Aw heyllll NO!\n\nThe broth at Pho Kim Long was just \"aiight\" but I guess not bad for Las Vegas... I dont expect Vegas to have top quality pho anyways. Let's face it, people go to Vegas for buffets, gambling, parties, drinking, lap dances, and drive through weddings. Not pho. \n\nSo I'm rating PKL (FHL hehe) with 4 stars.

I am already use to doing this at a few places in Los Angeles, so no complaints there for me. Maybe for people who expect to be checked  once-in-a-while will complain. When you ask for a request, they come back quickly which is good. The ambiance was loud since there were a lot of people who showed up to dinner at the time. The decor was nice and fitting. The chairs were comfortable. This place is open 24 hours. Big plus there in my book! I will come here again."

But I'll have to give it to them for their 24/7 convenience and great tasting broth ."

I ordered the special (I forgot what it was called, but it had everything that was suppose to come in the pho). The bowl size on the special is the largest so the waiter won't ask which size you want. Price is whatever, some people say its high compared to other places in Vegas, I haven't been to any other, so basing it off from the prices in California, about a tad above average I guess.\nThe service wasn't bad, our drinks got refilled when we asked, we got our neccesary things."

Pho Kim Long definitely has more... hence the name... LOL\n\nI always, always get the claypot pork.  A perfect compliment to that is steamed rice and canh cua (hot n sour soup).

It doesn't make it any better that I reside by a Pho Kim Long in the San Jose area. But I digress. Now onto the review! This place is where my family and I go to when we need our pho fix. It's seems perpetually open and a convenient drive from the strip. The staff is surprisingly nice and upbeat on all my visits (something you don't really experience from any other pho restaurant no matter what time you go there.). Reasonably priced and good food. This restaurant sets the bar on Vietnamese restaurants. I will definitely go again if I'm ever in Vegas and want pho. I have even recommended people here."

Considering this place is the go to place for drunk munchies, I liked it. \n\nThere were tons of menu options from an array of noodle dishes, phos, and rice plates. It is open super late, so after you're done partying on the strip at like 4 am, you come here to eat! Came here with my gfs and our new found friends and we got the pho. YUM. It was really good! A little on the salty side but the meat was freshly pink and the noodles was yummmmy. \n\nThe fried rice was kinda gross though. It was pretty bland and tasteless. I felt like I was just eating it just to eat it. My gf got the drunken noodles, which are the wide flat rice noodles. Kind of too oily for me but it was really good. Tons of basil flavor in it too! \n\nEven though the rice was bad, I give this place 4 stars because it is cheap, open late, and fun place to go to after you club."

One of the friends ask for some condense milk. The response of the waiter was what do you need it for. That was unnecessary. Because it is open early we like to start our day early. We like to enjoy our precious day here in NV. Thanks Pho Kim Long for ruin our day. Just a friendly reminder for who is looking an enjoyable vacation please avoid this place at all cost.

When the lady asked who had a table of 16, we said that was us. She asked where everyone was and we let her know they were on the way. She then said she could not seat us if everyone wasn't there. We again said they were almost there and she told us she was going to give up our table. Luckily our friends ran in right then and there. They still missed a seat so our friend had to stand around for a couple of minutes. The pho was disgusting. It was so salty that no one at our table finished our bowls and I was only able to take two bites. One of my friends had to pour his water into the pho. Worst dining experience of my life. I would never recommend this place to anyone."

The pho is good enough to satisfy my craving; the broth is pretty good(before I add in all my extras) and the fixins are fresh. \n\nService has always been pretty good here, so no complaints there.  PKL can get pretty busy late night, so I expect service to take a step back due to the stress of the volume of people, more of them drunk and crazy, coming in and out during those times. \n\nParking can be pretty chaotic; so I would almost always opt for a cab if it's within your means. It's china town, so you know it'll be crazy, even during weekly lunches. Which is again why I would choose not driving if possible."

Since it's been a while, tho, I can't really remember each dish...but here goes:\n\nThere was a stir fried udon plate that was really realy good. Actually, it's one of the dishes that we took back to the hotel, to-go...and later had as a midnight snack. I know, gross right? But hey, it was perfectly fine!!! No tummy aches...\n\nWe ordered the pea shoots for our veggie dish, and it complemented all the other dishes so well. It really helps to have a veggie dish to go with the meat-y, rich dishes.\n\nThe calamari (or maybe it was fried squid?) was nice and crispy, with lots of extra crunchy flakes on top.

Take a tasty broth, add some expertly-sliced thin meat, scallions and rice noodles are offer the ingredients in a bowl.  Add some basil, bean sprouts and spicy peppers on the side (with an optional side of rooster sauce and other spicy, sweet and/or sour sauces).\n\nSimple enough, but get the right bowl of pho and your view of the world drastically improves.  Call it stomach psychiatry--a really tasty bowl of pho can directly stimulate serotonin levels in the brain (more serotonin = more happy).  \n\nBut all of that just speaks to the genius that is pho.  Here's why you should head to Pho Kim Long for your pho fix.  When I was there, I ordered the rare steak and brisket pho.  The beef broth was well-prepared and pretty rich.  Other reviewers seem to have complained about the quality of the broth, but during my lunch there it was spot on.  It was a very solid offering.  The side veggies were crisp and fresh and delicious.  \n\nAnd Pho Kim Long offers a well-stocked selection of sauces if you like to tinker with your food--making it spicier, sweeter, a dash of sour, etc.  It all made for the perfect pho lunch.  The other folks at my table had the beef vermicelli (\"bun\" in Vietnamese) and were very pleased, reporting that the bun was better than most.  All of which earns it about 3.5 stars (rounded up because of how popular the place seemed--gotta give some credence to the will of the people).\n\nGood enough that Pho Kim Long has become a standard in my list of Vietnamese places in town.  And the crowd there at lunch suggests that this place has become a go to lunch destination in Chinatown.  It has a big dining space and every table was packed when we were there.  That might explain why service was a little slow when we were there.  But, to the wait staff's credit, they didn't seem to mind when we stepped over to the cashier without a bill in order to settle up.  \n\nI haven't tried it late night, but the place is open 24 hrs so it might be worth a visit after a night out on the strip (put down the Jack in the Box, pick up the chopsticks)."

For months, we have seen a line out the door on Spring Mountain, but I guess, because you were right down the street from the entrance to CES, many of the people came, but they came because your dishes were so good. No one else went to the restaurants around you. We went to Lee's for sweet drinks of boba pearl fruit smoothies for the children, but never stood in line. Finally, we decided to stand in line. The wait was worth it. Now we have returned twice. The seafood dishes, noodle soups with shrimp - Lots of shrimp - the thick chow fun noodles in black bean sauce with grilled beef steak. Pho Kim Long has an extraordinary menu with curry flavors, beef noodles, excellent broth, shell fish, and the place is always packed. See for yourself. Leave the Las Vegas Strip to drive west on Spring Mountain. Pass Valley View. Pho Kim Long is right there in the Chinatown center on the left as you drive west. You will be glad you did. Plus the place is open 24 hours, but we usually try to get there before 6 pm after my son gets out of school. Sincerely, Thomas Chee"

So needless to say wasn't too thrilled about that Pho Kim Long wait for the wrong food.  \n\nThat is why they only get 3 stars from me, besides the place better be \"Pho King\" Amazing to deserve more stars. \nThat's a good name \"Pho King\", or \"Pho King Good\", hmmmn...\n(probably been done....Phok)\n\nWe are all so Phonny....not. (slapping my own face)\n\nThey are OPEN 24 hrs... duh...Vegas."

The facility was CLEAN!!  Now, that's something you don't see very often in pho joints.\nI also ordered the che ba mau (three-color dessert) and it was just okay.  It was in a small cup and I was charged $3.50.  Kinda pricey, but, meh, I've had better.  I took my parents here (who grew up in Vietnam and are self-proclaimed pho connoisseurs) and they really liked the food.  Score!  I pat myself in the back. The only downside was that it's a little pricier (by $1 or $2) than what my family and I were used to paying compared to pho in LA .  A couple dollars may not seem as much, but it'll add up.  That aside, come here and enjoy the pho."

So, off we trecked to the next Asian restaurant and landed in Pho Kim Long.\n\nOne thing about this place is that it's open 24 hours a day and I was informed that they are the only pho place that has these hours.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  It was my bf, and two of our friends who shared this experience with us.  I never really know what to order from here so I had our friend order for  me.  \n \nWhen the bowl came my way, I was very excited as I'd never had it before.  I believe it was pho with some kind of beef balls.  There were other meats in there but I forgot to ask what type it was.  The broth was good without the extra sauces that people normally put in there.  When adding the bean sprouts, mint, and jalapeno's the kick it gives is a whirlwind of pleasures in your tongue.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the fried rice.  The color was somewhat orangey-yellow.  We've never had anything like it.  Per our friend, the way it's made is the cook adds just the yolk to give it that sunshine color.  It's definitely different but I can't say I'd order it for myself in the future.  The other dish we had was a spicy tofu.  That was really addicting.  Normally, tofu doesn't blend well with anything because of how bland it is.  But, they added the right amount of spice to give it a pleasing taste.\n\nThe atmosphere of the whole restaurant was very relaxed.  Most people come here to sober up after a wild night at a club or bar.  It only makes sense."

The staff isn't all Vietnamese, but they were friendly and speedy. :)  Downside, I think they truly specialize in just Pho, but created at 'Vietnamese diner' style menu, meaning there was just about every Vietnamese dish on the menu and included some Thai dishes.  I don't judge a place for the variety, but it does make me ponder...\n\nLast unfortunate note, the chili container had LOTS of MOLD buildup...Pho Kim Long, please check up on that stuff!  Don't want to see you closed down because of poor handling of foods...\n\nIf I come back to town, I may dismiss this place; while it is ingrained in my memory for Thanksgiving dinner, it's not ingrained in my memory for stellar Viet food."

Right when we were seated, we were asked what we wanted to order FOUR TIMES within a 10 minute time period. Barely having any time to think, the manager asks after his second time, \"Ready to order? There are people waiting to eat so you guys should hurry and make a selection\". (He said something rude along the lines of that). They are basically just trying to get people in, take the money, and kick them out. This is definitely the worst customer service I've ever had in a restaurant. \n\nI ordered a #13 combination pho (the combo wasn't really a combo considering there was barely much variety in there)\nMy friend ordered the steak rice plate, which looked slapped on without nice plating presentation. It was not worth the amount paid for the quality. \n\nI don't think I've ever had such a poor experience at a Vietnamese Restaurant. I see some previous complaints about the manager below and it is certain that he hasn't changed at all. What a dick. Please take this evaluation into consideration before going here to eat."

Food is very good, prices are competitively reasonable, food delivery is quick but customer service sucks especially when they get busy which is usually most of the time. It's not the long wait that irked us but rather the disrespect when they serve. This happened to my family and guests of 7 just hours ago during dinner time. I'm in the service industry and my job emphasizes respect especially to customers. I've never seen anywhere that I've dined in where in the middle of the meal, they already served us the bill even though none of us asked for it. Maybe not a Vietnamese culture but rushing the bill to the guests is like telling them to \"eat fast, pay the bill, and get the hell out because there are other customers waiting to be served.\"  Then after serving the bill, they started to bus our plates and the worst part happened. I was still finishing my favorite dish when a waiter stood right behind me while extending his arm trying to reach my plate and asked me if I'm done?!? Was this f@&%ing guy serious or what? Not even a word of politeness like \"excuse me ....\". It was just plain rudeness. Sure enough, I got pissed off and hastily paid the bill and reported the incident to the bald-headed supervisor/manager over which, he offered a free replacement of the dish which I was finishing. The damage was done and turned down the freebie, told him that WE will write some negative reviews about our experience and just walked out. So this is my honest review of the place and probably my last too. And watch out for that automatic gratuity TIP that they charge which is usually around 15%-18%. These guys will be tongue-tied to tell about it and sucker any generous ignoramus into OVER tipping them."

PKL is a place I've been frequenting since moving to Las Vegas 6 years ago.  This 24 hour joint offers some of the best Pho I've tasted.  On my drive over, my mouth salivated with anticipation for what was about to happen!\n\nIt's located on Spring Mountain and Valley View in a super long Chinese themed strip mall.  To me, this building signifies the beginning of Chinatown.  It says, I have arrived in Las Vegas' Asian scene and makes me feel right at home!  When you get into the restaurant, there's a pretty tight seating area.  The idea, though, is to have a lot for tables for dining.  The place is decked out with different tones of brown, Vietnamese and other Asian inspired design and art.  Statues of elephants and Asian soldiers gives an extra accent to the place.  Our service was a little sub par.  The server wasn't the most personable.  Didn't greet us.  Just came over and asked if we were ready to order.  At the end of the night, we literally had to walk up to him to get our check.  Thank goodness the food was good...\n\nFor my meal, I always, get number 15:  Beef Pho Noodle Soup with rare steak and brisket for around $8.  This soup is on point!  The soup is packed with thin strips of brisket and rare steak.  The rareness continued to cook in the warm broth.  The noodles were thin but plentiful.  There was also green onions in the dish, served with bean sprouts, sliced jalapenos and basil stems on the side.  All components offer a different but pleasant texture and flavor.  All seemed to mesh very well together.  But let's talk about the star of the show: the broth.  The broth is what sealed the deal for the dish and real brought a flavorful effect.  It wasn't too salty or overpowering.  It's was just right.  Warm and packed with beef flavor.  SO GOOD!!!\n\nListen, if you haven't tried Pho Kim Long yet, you are definitely missing out!  Like mentioned before, this joint stays open all night.  Great for monsoon season, winter season and after a night at the clubs.  Look for the Chinese strip mall and stop by!"

He also ordered the honey walnut shrimp w/mayo. They were good but not as good as I remember. Also you have to eat them right away because as soon as they cool off the sauce leaves a film in your mouth.

We visited around 9pm on a Sunday night and the place was adequately busy for a 24-hour joint. We got waters quickly and our pho came out in a matter of minutes. The broth was ok; saltier and less flavorful than the pho I've ever had before. I'm partial to deep, hearty, anise-infused broths that don't need hoisin or sriracha for enhancement. Needless to say, I was let down. On the bright side, I was happy to find something 5 minutes away from the strip, even if it's located in a strip mall decorated by a fake Chinatown facade. \n\nTwo stars for the pho, but I thought the service was fine and the bathroom was surprisingly not filthy."

Their pho is probably the worst I have ever had, the broth is literally tasteless and has maybe a couple of scallions floating in it.  They give you the usual plate of veggies on the side, but their veggies are not fresh enough and the plate is almost entirely bean sprouts (not enough lime, jalapeno, thai basil, etc).  Their fresh spring rolls were not good, they fried the tofu in them and wilted the wrapper (ugh!).  Do not come here if you are vegetarian, they have literally nothing on the menu (no veggie pho, no broth that is not chicken or beef, tofu spring rolls were special order).  Also important to note, this place is not authentically Vietnamese- their hot and sour soup was not the clear vietnamese style with pineapple but the chinese style with dark broth.  What is up with that?  Thai tea was mediocre, doesnt compare to anywhere in the area.  Service here is off the charts bad, I am talking waiters that are actually rude (not just neutral).  With so many great options in the same area that are open equally late, I would never return here."

I've been their customer for about six and a half years now and probably visited this restaurant more than 80 times. Highly recommend their springs rolls (which is a bit over-priced but it's tasty so it's worth the extra few dollars $$), their fried egg rolls, lettuce wraps, and combination pho! They have other selections that aren't just Vietnamese cuisine but that of Chinese, Thai, Korean, and Japanese (very little but still present).\n\nTheir prices have increased over the years but their taste still gives them the huge reputation they have. Sometimes my visits vary a bit with them when it comes to their service; either they're really awesome and friendly OR they're lifeless and non-attentive.

Good enough for me! \n\nNo need to detail my visits to the curiously-named hot spot as all it comes down to is needing a place to fill the stomach + to sober up whether it's the wee hours or late morning. It's in a strip mall right along Spring Mountain Rd so parking is not a problem... just expect it to be a bit crowded during late hours. The selection on the menu is a decent variety of Vietnamese dishes, but the pho options are pretty limited. Regardless, somehow I find myself ordering a bowl of Pho Tai (rare beef) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=_jQ4QD84l_CUpsLD8L9LSg or something similar every time. A bowl of pho is about $7-8, which is on the pricey side compared to what I'm used to both in Northern or Southern California, but the portion size is good enough. Quality is okay... soup is filled nearly to the brim, but the broth could be more flavorful + the noodles/beef are whatever. Average at best. We got spring rolls once, which were equally not noteworthy in any way other than that they actually gave us 2 peanut sauce dipping bowls... for the 3 of us. o_O http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=n7M27mi6yD0uqDjCHP6VPw  Perhaps next time I'll try something other than pho since most of the more positive reviews here seem to be for other items on the menu. \n\nIn retrospect, I'm sure there's better late night eats of the soupy-noodley sort in the Chinatown area or elsewhere off the Strip, but Pho Kim Long does its job. I'd give 2.5 stars if I could... but I'm rounding up. 3 stars for a convenience of this 24-hour, clean place to chow down because sometimes there's just nothing more satisfying than a steaming bowl of noodles."

            "review": "I really wonder if they named this after Kim Long or they meant to Pho Kim Long Time. Either way, out of many many Pho restaurants I've tried in Atlanta, New York, San Diego and San Francisco, this one is one of my favorites. Only Pho I've tried in Vegas but they know what they're doing. \n\nYou'll be greeted by a huge Sea aquarium the type you see in MTV Cribs worth thousands of dollars. This place must be doing good business because the decorations inside are pretty hard core. They have another aquarium with a King fish and black and white Nemo's. Pretty awesome! \n\nThe staff at this place is excellent at serving the customers. I think everyone that was working at Pho Kim Long (I can't stop laughing at this name) came up to our table (except the cooks). We had a busy table so you know how it is when people like to add picky stuff to their Pho... garlic, limes, extra mint, chili paste, nguoc mum, sriracha... etc. \n\nI ordered the Bun with Egg Rolls (cho gio) and char-grilled BBQ pork. The bowl was a bit smaller than usual but it was very well made. This is a simple dish but the key item is the noodles. Sometimes they are too soggy or they can also be too dry and sticky. This place had perfect noodles for the Bun. \n\nThe servers gave us some Pho broth since it was so cold outside. Very nice gesture! Everyone had a small bowl of broth which was very good in flavor. However, if this is the Pho broth they use for every dish then I would avoid the Pho since it was a bit heavy in texture. I thought it should be more watered down. We had an additional order of fried egg rolls which was pretty decent, nothing fantastic but still good. \n\nSomething unique about this place is their variety of Asian cuisine. They are obviously mainly Vietnamese but you can also find Chinese dishes and even Pad Thai. Very unusual in my experience. One of my friends ordered combo #108 which was amazing. It was similar to Bo Luc Lac but with bigger meat pieces and with excellent steamed broccoli. I'm getting #108 next time. \n\nFound my hangover spot a couple of miles off the strip! Pho Kim Long Soon!"

But here's what I make of the place:\n\nNot too bad...was this placed called something else prior to being Pho Kim Long? I know we came here ages ago (my family and I) and I was sorely disappointed back then. This time around it wasn't too bad and it was actually quite good. The only problem was it was quite pricy for a bowl of Pho. I think it was 7 or 8 dollars for a average sized bowl. Trust me, coming from San Jose, CA you have places with an XL bowl costing you only 4 to 5 bucks. \n\nOverall, I give them 3/3.5 out of 5. It was better then before, food was YUM-O, and service was eh, and the atmosphere was also EH. Enjoy!"

I think due to the 24/7 hours, they've changed the way they make their food and it's no good. \n\nThe pho isn't good at all. The soup doesn't have the beef flavor in it at all, it just doesn't taste how pho should taste. \n\nThe service here sucks. You're already waiting in a long ass line just to finally get in and wait some more. Once you're seated, the waiter/waitress will just give you your menus and leave...not even dropping off water. Sometimes it'll take almost 30mins until they comeback to take the order. \n\nThe last two times I went were not good at all. \n\nI went with my friend and we were seated in a corner and completely forgotten about. \n\nAnother time, I went with my parents and sister.

The chicken was cut up into thin slices of white meat which was a bit chewy. The broth was pretty much a fail with very little flavor. At 8 or 9 bucks for this bowl of noodle soup, I definitely expected better. And since my food was unsatisfying, I took a few bites off of a friend's fried rice. That  was too oily for my taste. I was not feeling that either.\n\nSo aside from the very quick service (got our food in about 5 minutes after they took our order), the complimentary hot tea, open 24hrs., and the fact that the name does have a tendency to make people laugh and tell off colored jokes at 3 in the morning, it's just not the local spot for good Asian eats.\n\nIf you had the \"best\" of anything here.... you were drunkers, pho sure."

            "review": "My Recommendation: There are much better options for pho around town during regular business hours. This place is only good to satisfy an after-hours craving.\n\nWhen you walk into Pho Kim Long, the first thing you see in front of you is a hostess booth, which is very out of place considering they don't have a hostess. You have to wait for a busser to seat you. That system is very inconvenient when it's busy. You'd have to wait until one of the bussers frees up to even put you on the waiting list, so essentially, you have to wait in line before you get the chance to wait \"in line\".\n\nAlthough I have tried and liked other things on the menu, I mainly just order the Pho. For a place called Pho Kim Long, you'd assume they'd put their main focus into their pho dishes, unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case. The overall taste of the Pho is good, but it's the uneven portions that deduct from its rating. Too much meat and not nearly enough noodles. One visit, I ordered a large Rare Beef Pho, but the waiter gave me a small. I'm not upset about that. That's a simple mistake, but just out of curiosity, I reached into the bowl with my chopsticks and lifted up the noodles to get an idea of how much came in that order. It was pathetic. I was easily able to  hold every noodle up with one swipe. I thought \"maybe it's just because it's the small\". I then told the waiter about the size error and he came back almost immediately with the correct size, but when I checked to see what portions I was given this time, it was like deja vu. \nI received almost exactly the same amount. It's as if they just poured the small bowl from earlier into a larger bowl and added a few more scoops of broth. The lack of noodles is where the imbalance of noodle-to-meat ratio comes in. I was long done with all of my noodles before my meat. I had to resort to biting my noodles in an attempt to ration them so I had some for every new piece of meat, and this is a definite \"no-no\" in the noodle world. \n\nCustomer service is friendly, when present. This place often gets hit with a high volume of customers during the night (probably because they are one of the few Vietnamese restaurants that stay open 24 hours) so if you like places where the waiter is very attentive, this is not the place for you. Although I do commend them for being able to keep a friendly demeanor under stressful conditions, it's just sometimes I'd prefer a refill on my drink instead of a smile.\n\nThe restaurant itself is gorgeous. The walls are aligned with live aquariums and decorative flora and for such a high traffic restaurant, it is kept extremely clean. To be honest, it looks like a fine dining establishment.  \n\nAnother positive about this place, that I briefly mentioned before, is that it is open 24 hours and conveniently located just off of the strip. It's close enough to not be a hassle to get to after a long night of partying, but far enough to get away from all of the chaos of stereotypical Las Vegas. \n\nI have a strong suspicion that their pho dishes are premade. The wait time from point-of-order to point-of-arrival is very short. Extremely short if you take into consideration how busy it gets; that's most likely why they'd do that. If I had to wait as long as it would take to make every meal made-to-order, the wait would not even be worth it. \n\nIn short, I would probably never crave Pho Kim Long's pho specifically, but if it's after hours and I am craving pho in general, this would be the place to go only because there aren't many other options."

Whether you pronounce it correctly or not...it all sounds alike. \"PHO KIM LONG\" ... Yup that's the name of this fine restaurant.  Don't let the name fool you though.  The place has since been remodeled a while back with simple yet beautiful decor & backdrops that really make a difference and give you an ethnic feel to your Vietnamese dining experience.  Whenever one feels the crave for some luscious pho, this place will do justice.  They open early and close late practically open 24 hours...this place is great for lunch with family, a dinner date for two or a cure for your late night hang overs with friends.  In fact Pho Kim Long is great anytime to fill your tummy to satisfaction.  \n\nThis place can get packed, especially on a weekend at peak hours...so be prepared for the crowd.  A downfall to this is their small waiting area up front.  With very little seating and standing area, this can be and is a fire hazard. But when this happens you know they must be doing something right...to have such an audience of hungry on goers wait amongst each other.  \n\nWhen you do get seated, be excited for once you decide what to order, the food is prepared quick and comes right out.  My favorite Pho here is the combination.  This comes with chewy yet tender tendon that melts right when you chew, also has your usual thin sliced flank raw meat & other goodness...the broth is very soothing and comes packed with flavor.  Their Salt & Pepper Calamari is scrumptious, but eat it fresh and hot as it will get soggy after a while...but still a yummy snack even after.  For those non-pho PHOnatics...they do have rice and other dishes to get your palates tainted with flavor....from pork, to beef, to fish, to even pad thai noodles...they par up pretty well.  My favorite dessert drink here is their Avocado Shake Smoothie with tapioca boba!  They must have atleast 100 pieces of boba....sounds like fillers...but they do give a generous amount of avocado shake in it.  You can also request the shake without boba.\n\nAll in all...I may be too generous giving this place a high rating with 5 stars.  Others would disagree with me, as I can understand...I should be giving it only 4 stars because of the waiting area (but only an issue when it is packed) and also because prices here tend to be just a tad bit higher than some close rivals that are side by side comparable in quality,  I do give it 5 stars though because for some reason...I still keep coming back here for more ... rather than 2 others who are in my top 3 of Pho places in Las Vegas.\n\nDon't forget, you can also take out! and Pho Kim Long is very generous in portions!  You may pay a dollar or 2 more, but the portions are respectable and they wont rip you off like some other places:\n **COUGH-COUGH(PHO ROSE)COUGH-COUGH**"

Or even hangover food lol A little off the strip but that's cool. It's a pretty big place that seems be busy all the time. Last year, I came after clubbing around 2am and it was packed. This time, I went around 11:30am and there wasn't a line so we got seated right away. But by 12, there was a huge line out the door. For how packed it was, their service is pretty decent. Not too slow, but not exactly fast either.\n\nWe ordered egg rolls and lettuce wraps for appetizer. Both equally delicious and fresh. I got the pho combination and they fill the bowl to the very top. To the point where it's almost spilling. It was so good but I couldn't finish because the bowl was so huge! Overall, a great pho place to check out. And if you're not a huge fan of vietnamese food, just go for the name ;) hehe"

The wait was rather long for a party of 10 since everyone and their mom is hoping for some pho after a late Saturday night and when you've had too much to drink. The prices are obviously high for what is known especially if you're from the LA area. A regular small bowl of Pho is $7.95 but if you get the Pho Dac Biet it's $8.95. There was a good amount of meat but the broth just seemed like water and oil. Also for some reason each of the Pho broth soups had a different color. Some were more murky than others even though the only difference was the type of beef they had. The service however, is quite good. They refilled our waters appropriately probably because they know most people are hungover and need their best friend aka H20. The interior decor is not too bad but it does look Asian but at least not that old ghetto Asian style. The parking lot can be quite hectic so park carefully so your cars don't get scratched by Asian drivers. Also it's nice that it is near a Lee's Sandwiches because I needed that Ice Coffee for the ride back to LA!"

Food-wise though, I've has much better. I think it's because of the volume of business they get. There is so many people that the kitchen churns out food at top speeds, compromising the quality of it. \n\nThe portions are not bad noodle-wise but they are pretty stingy with the beef slices. It makes for a very incongruous looking bowl of pho- plenty of white noodles with 3 tiny thin strips of beef. Also, the spring rolls were just okay (at best) -I was not impressed for what was supposedly \"the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas\". I've had so much better in small mom-and-pop restaurants in Los Angeles.\n\nService is top-notch. The waiters/waitresses are very attentive and see to your needs really well. \n\nThe only reason I will return is that this place is open 24 hours.

We got to Pho Kim Long, and giggled like idiotic teenage boys, at around midnight. The place was slammed. Super busy. We were seated immediately, and the hostess was incredibly friendly. We call this \"Las Vegas\" friendly. Like they're so used to tourists, it's just second nature to make the assumption that we're not from the area and treat us kindly so as not to destroy our vacation. There's a lot of this over there, and for that we're super grateful, being earthy, awkward Portlandians. \n\nWe ordered our drinks (I just had water, my partner ordered a beer) and before my partner's beer even had the chance to arrive we were served our starter (the salad rolls), followed quickly by the two delicious orders of Pho. Their peanut sauce was splendid, and the pho makes this my second favorite of all pho places I've been to, ESPECIALLY at midnight! The beer, unfortunately, came toward the end of dinner which is a no-no as far as my partner is concerned. Given the volume of customers that night, and the wonderful food and friendly, quick service, it was forgivable enough for us to come back and order take away to take back to our room a couple nights later when we were actually craving that delicious soup! We cannot wait to order from them again, in house or take away, either way the food is just as wonderful!"

While I'm still no expert, I obviously know what I like. I've been meaning to return so that I can properly evaluate this restaurant.\n\nSimply put, PKL is A-OK. Their pho satiates the appetite. Their broth is pretty good and the rest of the ingredients complement the soup nicely. Unfortunately, they do not serve tripe, which for me is a bummer. However, they do have that \"home made\" style chili sauce that I strangely prefer over plain old Sriracha. There's nothing wrong with Sriracha of course; I'm just weird like that.\n\nOne thing that PKL has going for it is the decor. Places like Pho So 1 make better pho but are completely devoid of any personality. You would never confuse PKL with a diner. That's really not that important to me though.\n\nIn the end, it's all about the pho. In that case, PKL is good enough, especially when no other place is open."

That was stupid! Hainan chicken with rice.

One of the girls in the group literally had to walk up to one of the workers just so she could order another order of eggrolls since no one was going back to our table. That second order of eggrolls probably took about 30 minutes to get to the table, which made no sense at all considering the first order only took like 5 minutes. After we were all done and waiting there for a longtime for someone to give us our check, we had to go up and ask the cashier for it, so they finally dropped it off at our table. Even after we put the money down on it, we still had to walk up to the cashier to give it to him.\n\nI have no idea wth was up with this place.

The plethora of good / decent places to go like Lee's Sandwich, Fat Dumpling, Mr. Tofu and etc make parking here limited and in high demand. It is nearly difficult to find any parking here, even if you are willing to walk.\n\nb.  Reasons - That is because PKL is open 24 hours!  The food is darn decent at times.  \n\nc.  Late meals - Finished a movie and midnight and came here for noodles on Friday night. At 1:00 am, the place was packed.  Our team waited only ten minutes for a table in the back room, where it says \" Employees only\"  Looks to be a room that they will slowly expand into and perhaps was another restaurant before?  \n\nd.  Pho - Had Number 13, which has everything in it and also the Bun Bo Hue with Pho noodles instead of rice noodles (vermicelli).  OK, don't hate that!  I know it is traditional to have BBH with the rice noodles. It is just that the consistency of the Pho noodles is soooooo much better and the texture is amazing. The way the noodles drape over your chopsticks as you shovel a huge portion into your mouth is just what the doctor ordered.  Hard to do with the rice noodles as it is bigger and the consistency is such that you cannot pack a bunch into  your mouth.  Hey it is part of the noodle experience if you ask me.  Just watch any movie where you watch the Japanese salary-men at lunch slurping down a bowl of ramen and I think you will get my drift.  Noodles are meant to be hoovered!  \n\ne.  Pho Part II - Anyway, the Bun Bo Hue at 1:00 am is a very, very good. The broth is just right, they serve the spice separately so you can make the soup as hot as you want.  They serve all the bits of tendon, offal, pork hock and everything you can imagine that was eaten in the city of Hue due to well, the poor economy.  I finally learned that offal is the stuff in meats that you cook that most people don't eat.  The offal is awfully good!!! It is what makes the soup.  My son had number 13 which is nearly like BBH without the pork hock and the spice. He slurped that up, but I won because my BBH came first and I had a head start!\n\nf.  The Chicken - Yep, ordered once again the Salted Baked Chicken with Ginger sauce.  Why?  Because it is so good, nutritious and a very good measure of the chef and the restaurant.  Simple to cook, yet easy to over cook, the meat has to be so juicy and tender. It is either that or overcooked as the entire taste is from the chicken itself.  It has to be on the bone, and it has to make you caveman like to use your hands to gnaw at every morsel of meat on the bone!  The ginger onion sauce has to be so good that you are putting it on the chicken like you would butter and you have to ask for more.  This time, the chicken was great.  I went there two weeks ago at 8:00 am and it was absolutely horrible.   So, I think that the chefs know at 1:00 am they will have a ton, so they are making it and storing it just right. At 8:00 am, the last time, I probably had a heated up stored chicken and it was as if \"I made it myself.  just mehhhh\".  Fresh and hot is best and it was rocking at 1:00 am.\n\nOverall, great menu, many of other choices on there that you would find in a Chinese restaurant and a great place to end up!\n\nNow they serve brown rice for 1.50 more.  This Chinese people are so good at making money on rice!  Here is the dealio though. At 1:00 am most of the people there are drunk or buzzed and needing greasy fatty foods to recover. I don't think they are so worried about brown rice.... \n\n\nGK says, this is the late nite place to BE for sure!"

Noodles soft in the middle, crispy on edges (AWESOME).  Saucy, flavorful and lots of goodies like bok choy and shrimp.\n\n- The cubed beef with Chinese broccoli - Make sure you specifically ask for the cubed beef - they have regular beef and broccoli which is not so good.

We asked if we could barrow their calculator and he says we have to use our own and figure it ourselves and then he answers the phone and completely ignores us. We got upset at him, and he CAUSED us out! Of course we were causing back to depend ourselves but then he called security like we were some animals. This was the worse place I have ever been too."

I had the vermicelli noodles with BBQ pork and egg rolls. It was good but again, nothing amazing. We ordered egg rolls for appetizers too but I feel that they were a little expensive. It was 4 egg rolls for $6 or $7. \n\nThe service wasn't too great. It's the service you'd expect from an Asian restaurant. Impersonal and sometimes difficult to get the waiters' attention. They automatically charge a 18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more. That's a lot of tip for a small party. And I feel that they don't even do a lot to deserve that much tip. They take your order and serve your food. They don't refill your water automatically and they tend to ignore you if they can!"

So 5 min pass and everyone there is so good at not giving you eye contact so they don't have to walk over to you. Finally someone came and we asked for our condiments. My soup finally came and the egg noodles were overcooked  it was mushy and it felt gross.

Sometimes it was to feed post-clubbing munchies and at other times it was to nurse a post clubbing hangover.  Pho Kim Long was always one of the first Pho restaurants that popped up on Yelp when you searched it and in my less than 100% state I remember thinking it as pretty good.  But now that I'm a little bit older, wiser, and more sober when I eating here, it is more like 2.5 stars (I rounded up for the good blurry memories).\n\nA bowl of Pho is right around 7.50 which isn't cheap or crazy expensive.  You can pretty much order any combination of rare beef, tripe, tendon, meatball, etc. that suites your fancy.  They give you a very average portion of everything.  One of the things that stops me from giving them more stars is their broth.  I feel that it is all about the broth; it is what makes or breaks a bowl of Pho.  I just don't find their broth to have very much flavor like other places.\n\nAnother reason why I can't justify giving them more stars is because their service is on the slow side.  I've been there on more than one occasion and even though they have lots of room and should have figured out a way to handle to their customer flow, I still always find myself waiting for really long periods of time for my food.  I don't really order anything fancier than a bowl of Pho so it shouldn't take that long.\n\nI'm sorry Pho Kim Long. I want to like you more because of our history, but you are just another average Pho Joint and nothing special in my mind."

The broth was good but a little salty and not that rich.  Noodles were good but standard pho.  I've been getting spoiled with these fat noodle pho joints...Honestly, if it were 3am and I really wanted pho, I think it probably would be just perfect.\n\nThe FRESH SPRING ROLL and the FRIED SPRING ROLL were really good - the spring rolls were more of a hit than the pho.  Great peanut sauce and dipping sauce for the fried ones too.\n\nThe COCONUT was really tasty.  They give you a spoon and crack open the top as well, but just drinking the juice was so refreshing!\n\nThere is a clipboard with a waiting list at the front.  Not the friendliest service but just deal.\n\nSmall waiting area and crowded parking lot.  The restaurant is pretty big but it seems to fill up too.  It looks like the restaurant used to be a Chinese restaurant since the style doesn't look like your typical pho place.\n\nTo be fair, it's better than any other pho I've had on the strip, but that's not saying much.  So if you can get off the strip for pho, this one is definitely worth it."

I can't even begin to count the many drunk nights and hungover mornings spent sipping the miracle broth of Pho Tai, or the awkward dates spent loading it with all of the bean sprouts, lemon juice, and hoisin sauce it can hold to sidetrack myself from the shmuck on the other side of the table.\n\nI love this place. I'm a long time Pho-lover and have been to dozens of restaurants serving Vietnamese and Thai food, but Pho Kim Long is my favorite - and not just because of the daring name ;)\n\nFirst, they're open 24 hours. Meaning you can stumble in wasted at 3AM on a Saturday and they won't blink twice - as long as you don't stir trouble, or enjoy a lovely non-traditional Thanksgiving day brunch to avoid family members - which I haven't done but have certainly been tempted to. You can also order for pick up. \n\nI enjoy that the atmosphere feels fitting for a plethora of different occasions. The restaurant is always clean and has the kind of feel to it where you can easily come here to enjoy a nice date, or to end a night of partying in casual attire. Or call ahead to pick up food and eat it at home in your pajamas - you know, whatever.\n\nIn general I've stuck with my time tested favorite, Pho Tai - thinly sliced rare beef thrown into a tasty broth and loaded with bean sprouts, noodles, lemon, onions, and what else your heart desires as long as the kitchen has stock. Expect to pay $7-8 for a generously portioned bowl. However, the many times I've been here with friends everyone has been satisfied with their non-Pho choices. If your stomach can hold it, they also have spring rolls to die for and delicious boba smoothies. The quality of food has always been consistent.\n\nThey lose one star because, unlike the quality of their food, their service is inconsistent. I've never received truly terrible service there, and it is certainly light years above many other Chinatown joints, but you do get the feeling that some of the young waitstaff is only there because they're being forced by parents who likely share ownership.\n\nIf you're in the area and enjoy Vietnamese/Thai cuisine - check it out. You won't regret it."

Pho broth was very watered down and lacked a lot of real flavor. I will say that the meat was still on point, but the broth defines the meal. Other friends ordered a pan-fried noodle that was not crispy due to the amount of sauce penetrating the dish. Their honey walnut shrimp of $16 was laughable with the small portion size given.\n\nA couple strikes in and I have lost faith in this place.

The waiter seemed to rush us a bit but hey, I wasn't complaining since we were late anyway. \n\nI got the #15 - steak & brisket ($7.50) - and added meatballs on the side ($1). The broth is soo flavorful, it actually tasted worse once I doused my soup in sriracha & hoisin sauce (my usual routine) which is pretty crazy for a pho place if you ask me. The steak is cooked with a little pink in the middle and the noodles are chewy, not soggy like a lot of places. It is a bit pricey for a pho place, but the quality is what you're paying for.\n\nI honestly can't tell if this is one of the best phos I've ever had, or if I was just that hungry.

I searched Yelp, and voila! Pho Kim Long was only half a mile away.  \n\nI ordered my usual pho dac biet.  The prices were slightly higher than what I was used to in San Francisco, but it was well worth it. I'm not sure if it was because I was hungover or because I hadn't had pho in a long time, but I thought the broth was fantastic!  Everything else in the bowl was standard.  But my one gripe is that there was not tripe!  \n\nI've found my new go-to hangover spot in Vegas, and they're open 24 hours!"

They gave us the menu and came back a minute later to take our orders. It would take me at least 5 to decipher their menu. \n\nIn addition, one of my friends and I ordered similar pho but with slight differences in meat. One was large and the other was small.  After they brought out our food we started eating. 5 minutes later they came back to say that our bowls were mixed up.  For one thing, there is no noticeable differences between a large bowl and a small bowl. Well no use complaining about that anymore.\n\nThe pho quality was somewhat substandard, salty, and lacked effort.  I know its Vegas, but there are many pho restaurants in the area and I've tried one a few blocks down Spring Mountain that actually has tasty well made broth.  This place did not give a lot of meat either.  \n\nI can only tell you that I am not coming back here.  It does look clean and all, but you will not be satisfied, just like the many visitors of Vegas who gave this place a try."

Depending on the day/time, there can be a bit of a wait. But I have been here a couple of dozen times and can honestly say: big venue, lots of tables, quick service, consistently good food.\n\nTO START: Get the GOI CUON (SPRING ROLLS). Comes with four shrimp/pork/lettuce filled cold spring rolls with peanut sauce that is literally crack. Their recipe for it is so perfected, I can literally just eat it with a spoon. Also go for the CRAB RANGOONS. Eight perfectly fried wontons filled with cream cheese & crab, paired with sweet n' sour sauce. \n\nFOR HER: I ordered the SHRIMP PAD THAI once when I wasn't in the mood for pho... and was mind blown! Seriously the best pad thai I have ever had. Yes, at a Vietnamese place! How? I don't know. But it's so filled with flavor & perfectly seasoned & lots of noodles... I can never finish it on my own, meaning leftovers for later! Try the combination for a mixture of shrimp, beef & chicken too. Delish!\n\nFOR HIM: This place has great (and cheap!) pho. He always orders the RARE STEAK & WELL DONE FLANK NOODLE SOUP. Cheaply priced, a generous amount of soup, noodles & meat... with a side of sprouts, jalape\u00f1os and all that good stuff to add as you please. More than enough to share with someone too! Add a little hoisin sauce, maybe a little sriracha for a kick. So good! The ORANGE CHICKEN is also a fave!\n\nOnly bad thing I can say? They don't have any lemon for your water...

As with all food in the US it felt a little heavy on the sodium but it wasn't bad like the places that put tons of MSG in their soups for flavour meanwhile inducing days of thirst after consumption.\nOn the night that we went after the club I had the chicken fried rice and it was really good.

            "review": "I'll start off by saying I love Pho Kim Long! So you're probably thinking \"well, your two star rating doesn't really indicate that\". It doesn't. I love the pho and the food in general. It's great! I've had pho at a few other places and it's just not the same. I also love that this place is open like 24 hours (maybe they close at some point, but I'm pretty sure I've ended up here past two a.m) The chicken pad thai is pretty freaking bad ass too! \n\nSo the reason for my two star rating is because I've had pretty crappy customer service at this place. I like to rate food establishments based on a few standards....quality of food, cleanliness, and customer service! Quality of food gets an A+, however, the other two categories fail miserably. I've been here plenty of times, which gives this place a lot of chances to improve their customer service, and they just don't! \n\nOne time we had to wait forever (which you can usually expect if you're going on the weekend or anytime during the dinner rush) and our waiter was just generally unpleasant. Nothing specific, just a bad attitude. The most recent visit, the waitress brought over our water and said she'd give us a few minutes, which happened to be maybe twenty minutes (I'm indecisive, but I don't need twenty whole minutes to choose my dinner). The water had a very tiny bug in it, which I really didn't think was a huge deal. I don't get grossed out easily so I just asked for another one. What really kind of got me thinking was how calm and casually the waiter reacted to it. He just nonchalantly said \"Oh, sorry. I'll bring you another one\" and quietly walked away with my bug infested water. Not the worst part. While still enjoying my pho and chatting with my girlfriend I was asked TWICE if I was finished with my food and almost got my plate taken away if I didn't respond fast enough! That was the deal breaker for me. I like to take my time when I eat, especially if I'm having good company and good conversation. So that really irked me. I felt rushed and uncomfortable. I wasn't asked if I wanted a box for my leftover food (didn't really want one, but I feel like servers should always ask, specially if there's a lot of food left on the plate). There's been other occasions in which they just refuse to accommodate a simple request or just show absolutely no enthusiasm. Lame!\n\nSo, in conclusion, if you want good pho and shitty customer service. This is the spot!"

He said he would settle for a salad because he wasn't really hungry. \n\nWell just as a heads up to others that may be seeking salad ...there is none. He did find Beef and Broccoli which is kind of like salad. He ate almost all of it except the little bit I took to taste it. The amount that was given is easily a good amount for two to three people but he finished it even though he wasn't that hungry! The meat was well seasoned and the broccoli was nice and crispy. I hate soft broccoli! \n\nI ordered the chicken fried rice for lunch this week at work since I came in on late Sunday I had no time to cook. It was pretty basic the chicken pieces didn't have any fat on them which is a good thing. I spiced it up with some Sriracha. \n\nThe Pho was good it wasn't too salty the veggies that came with it were fresh but I was surprised that they served it with lemon. When I usually get Pho I 've always been given limes to go with it. I wasn't going to be picky about it though. My Pho had the beef strips in it but it also came with these round meatballs . I didn't try it though ...I was wondering what it was . I concentrated on the broth just so my throat would feel better by morning. The Pho did help my throat on Monday but had to call in sick on Tuesday."

I would rather starve myself than eating here and getting food poisoning and must-be-paying for it. Avoid this place at all cost!!!! For detail, please read the following. \n\nI came here with a few friends and ordered a bowl of pho. My pho came out with the smell of drugs or some sort of medicines. But I just convinced myself that maybe the smell came from a different place. I proceeded for a little bit and that smell was so strong that I couldn't continue. And the smell actually came from my bowl of pho. I told the waiters that my food smells funny and tastes a bit bitter. He asked if I want a new bowl but I said no because my stomach felt weird at the time. A few minutes later, I had to run to the restroom inside the restaurant and threw up. When I came out, they gave my friends the check that included the price of that bowl of pho. They didn't want to take that $10 off the check regardless my reasonings. I would have tipped them $10 anyway if the service was good. So at the end, I asked him to remake the pho for me and put in togo boxes. Apparently I wasn't gonna eat it. Who would eat something at the same restaurant that gave you food poisoning a few minutes earlier? \n\nI personally think it was ridiculous and unethical. Indeed, it was absurd to charge the customers the food that poisoned them. They should be grateful that I didn't sue their ass for making dirty and poisoned food. This restaurant is crowded because it's one of the places opening 24/7. But I would rather starve myself than eating here and paying to get poisoned food."

I had never tried the spring rolls which from my recollection are shrimp and chicken with veggies wrapped in a rice paper and paired with peanut sauce.

The broth for the pho is beefy, hearty, and will really warm your soul!

Little Rock to Honolulu, LA to Vegas... Okinawa all the same. This Japanese wife of mine loves Pho. \nSo of course, off we go..... \nI must say, it's hard for me to necessarily tell the difference between Pho (broth etc) but SOMETHING about this place just seemed slightly better. Now then that's not to say the others were subpar... Just this one is somehow ... BETTER. \nMy wife, whom is some kinda pho semi-pro-am taster expert, confirmed my suspicions by vocally stating over and over how GOOOOOD hers was. \nI don't know the names. I had pho something with brisket. Large. Dumped sriracha in it and went to town. No veggies (onions etc) just meat and noodles and I Jammed out. No hassle from\nWaitstaff. \nThe wife got Pho Ga. Loved it. Large size. Put it like this... Of all the restaurants I review, she has never actually finished her meal, ever.... She slammed that large bowl, totaled it. That is a testament of how good/legit it was. \nVegas can get expensive... This place was refreshingly cheap and super delicious. About 3 min drive from circus circus. Parking is a B***h but whatever, circle around until you find one. It's worth it. \nIf you're visiting Vegas or a local... Get some Vietnamese in ya life... That Pho FoSho!"

Unfortunately, the bowl of pho dac biet that I had today doesn't quite match the flavor of restaurants back home in San Jose. It seemed smaller in size than I would find at a typical San Jose pho restaurant, so the price is high, especially if you have a regular bowl (as opposed to the large or dac biet size, which is inexplicably #13 on the menu instead of #1). Even the Thai basil that they hand out is pretty skimpy compared to every decent or good place in California. The rest of my table wasn't too impressed with the food either.\n\nIt's unfortunate... I wanted to like this place after hearing from some locals, but I guess I'll keep looking for a go-to spot to satisfy the occasional pho craving."

There's an aquarium plus this section against the wall that almost looks like a greenhouse without the plastic coverings.  Then the wall works...  it's a WOW!\n\nThe interior decorating is attractive Asian art.  I couldn't help staring at their money tree while waiting to be seated.  So there is a plant called a money tree.  But this restaurant had like folded money art hanging from plant trees.  I believe that is some symbol for prosperity of their business.  That is actually true; evident in the numerous people waiting, the well kept well designed interior.\n\nWe had about a 15 minute wait, but when we were seated I saw several open tables toward the back.  Not sure what was going on with their table seating management cuz there were plenty people standing to wait.  Perhaps they lack servers as well and didn't have the manpower.  \n\nExcept that our food came out pretty quick.  After being seated and already eating, I can see the activity going on was fast paced.  The kitchen was full staffed it seems.  Our food was great nothing wrong with presentation, or overcooked or blandness.  I just didn't like all the tendons in my soup.\n\nI swear too our server would drop off food, very short or no interaction.  Only announced what the order was, set it down, and disappeared.  I get it they're extremely high volume.  But I'd like to be able to comment oh kind, friendly, or patient whatever... not enough interaction to mention.\n\nThe menu had great selections too for pho, rice plates, appetizers... A fast meal, good food, nice set up.  Just enjoy it for what you're there for - to eat."

It serves congee -- only 3 versions though. \nLocated along the strip mall in Chinatown, with plenty of parking & open 24 hours a day.\n\nWe ordered: \n4 orders of Congee with preserved egg & pork $9.95: watery congee, kinda salty with shredded pieces of pork meat & small pieces of egg, not the best I've had because the congee was too liquidy!\n\n5 orders of Chinese fried donut $2.95 - they cut up the donut into bite size pieces, perfect to dip into the congee\n\n2 orders of Combination Pho - husband & father in law ordered this, they said it was good\n\n1 order of Yangzhou fried rice - we all shared this dish, it was ok. Nice to see shrimp in there, good if you add some chili garlic paste sauce..\n\nOverall glad we could dine here at 7:30 am in the morning & walk away full"

It's like 15 dollars for a freaking bowl of pho!\n\nAnyways, Pho Kim Long has pretty solid pho. It's more expensive than your normal pho, but it's Vegas and when you had a little too much fun clubbing the night before, you can't complain. It's also open 24 hours, so it is quite convenient.\n\nI haven't tried their other food, but they have a huge variety on their menu, including sea food. So whenever you're hungover in Vegas, head over to Pho Kim Long."

Pho Kim Long is open 24/7, and both times I've dined after 1am. They were very busy both times. The Salt and Pepper Calamari was a suggestion from my waiter. It was the bomb! I decided to try the Pan Fried Cake with pork and shrimp. It comes with a heaping bowl of lettuce and fish sauce. I didn't know what to do with the lettuce. The bus boy was helpful and very friendly. We were never asked what we wanted to drink. At least we were given water. I had to call the waiter over to order a drink half way through the calamari. I ordered coconut juice which came in the coconut. I didn't have time to enjoy the generous portions of calamari and pan cake. The waiter rushed the two bowls of Pho (noodle soup) and condiments to our table. I wanted to order a dessert but the waiter dropped the check and ran off. We were seated for barely 20 minutes and were being rushed. When he came back to the table I was going to ask for dessert but he didn't give me a chance. He said abruptly, \"Sorry, please pay.\" RUDE He stood there as I dug my credit card from my purse. I felt uncomfortable. My friend asked for boxes for the food uneaten. on our way out the door I heard our waiter rushing another table of 6 people. He mentioned something about a shift change. Then it clicked. Was he more concerned with the tip? WTH? Unlike my soft spoken self, someone at that table didn't take kindly to being rushed. With other Pho restaurants open late to choose from, I think I'll try the other late night Pho restaurants from now on. This place is just not special enough to deal with an unpleasant experience."

Surprisingly the place was filled with a bunch of families, not hungover partiers that I expected.  \n\nThe pho selection is surprisingly small but you can customize it by requesting add-ons. I got a #15 and added tendon The pho came out quite quickly but somehow they made a mistake on half our orders. I got a large bowl of pho with no tendon at all even though I requested a small. They said that add-ons automatically upgrades it to a large which I wasn't even told. However when I looked inside the bowl, there wasn't even any tendon! I'm fairly sure they messed up my order and forced me to take a large. They finally came by with some tendon after multiple requests and it was terrible. The tendon was chewy, hard and tasted like cardboard...one of the worst tendon pieces I've ever had. \n\nMy friends said this is one of the best in Vegas but if this is the best...I don't want to know what's the worse. The soup was bland and flavorless. The only saving grace was the huge amount of meat. I am still not sure why this place is so popular, maybe people are looking at the yelp ratings only?

Turns out they didn't even start working on the wings until that moment, the SECOND time we had to ask them about it.\n\nSo because we're fed up of waiting and I'm tired from a whole day of driving, we tell them to just cancel the wings.\n\nSeconds later, guy comes out to my table with a plate of wings, so we figure since they're out, we'll just pay for them and take them to-go. Nope, cashier gets defensive and very RUDELY tells us we can't buy the wings anymore, tells his waiter to go grab the plate right as I'm about to grab a wing.\n\nNever coming here again, and definitely WOULD NOT recommend this place to anyone else.\n\nIf you're in the Las Vegas area and looking for some great Vietnamese cuisine (I would know, I'm Vietnamese), I'd recommend you SKIP this place, and take the time to drive a little further down the road (same street actually), and eat at Pho So 1 (literally translated as #1 Pho) instead.\n\n(Editing for formatting to make it easier to read)"

I told my server that hubby and my bowl did not have enough noodles and they said that's how it's served. So we each order another serving of noodles for $3.00. Spring rolls were puny...really puny for $5.00, about 30% smaller than what you would get in a typical food joint. The egg rolls were super greasy, so greasy I had to roll them into the napkins before I served them to my children. I asked for hot tea, the hot tea never came, but the ice water that I never ordered arrived. The bill came out to be $38 and some change with tip included. (You don't get a choice.) I voiced my disatisfaction with another server who I thought was a manager and then the owner. They just said sorry and did nothing to ameliorate the situation. Overall, the food is ok, but it's expensive considering Vegas is the most wasteful place on earth with all the buffets.

'He's just having one of those days...'\n\nNow, for starters, I'm in the culinary industry for a living and I know how the kitchen works, hospitality and understand how irritable it would be to have to change an order once it's already rung in and we started cooking it... We literally just took the order and the place was decently busy... \n\nIn the politest way possible I asked: \"Excuse me? If it's possible to change the pad thai to chicken instead of beef. We ordered beef by accident\" \n\nhe said \"chicken pad thai?! you ordered beef pad thai\"\nMe: \"I understand if it's too late to change that's fine\"\nHe points his finger at me as he said something angrily to where I didn't understand him because he was walking away and hits the wall... The people next to us on BOTH sides of us heard the whole conversation. \n\nHe literally points, walks away, smacks the wall as he turns the corner and comes back and tells me \"it's too late to change, you ordered beef and it's already ready\"\n\nJust watching him, his attitude and how fast we ordered, him walking to the kitchen to check and come back telling us our food is ready before our appetizers, I knew he was BS-ing... I then asked him \"if it's already ready, how come you didn't bring it out?\"\n\nHe walked away saying that we had to wait... I found the guy that ordered our food and asked nicely if it's too late to change it. \n\nOur server said \"yea that's ok, I just put the order in not too long ago... I'll go change it real quick before it is made\" As I was talking to the waiter, the other staff member who was rude to us, saw us talking to the server and came and started another scene, one which wasn't needed, I didn't mention the other server until he started the scene. He started yelling saying our food was ready and that we ordered beef. Luckily our server was very calm and spoke to him even though I didn't know what he was saying, I felt VERY uncomfortable not understanding what they're saying and him pointing his hand towards my BF and making my BF upset. \n\nOur server apologized for the fellow coworker but found it wrong for someone else apologizing for someone else's doings. \n\nI believe PKL is a bit overrated and lacks consistency. I don't know what kind of service I will walk into when I come here but like I said, for a 24/HR spot the food isn't too bad."

So not surprisingly, the pho is better than average.  My benchmark is the vermicelli with pork and egg rolls, and this one was good lean pork, and nicely crisp but not overly greasy egg rolls.  The young coconut drink is another benchmark for me, and they serve theirs in  the coconut, so you can scoop out the coconut meat and eat it afterwards.  Haven't had THAT since I was living in the Philippines.  Sure beats the version they serve at my local pho place in the sundae glass with the canned juice/meat.  Expect a short wait, but worth it!"

Well, they really aren't that as they are more of a Vietnamese restaurant with several Cantonese style Chinese dishes. But the food we ordered was pretty good nonetheless. I have been back many times, mostly for lunch and love their barbeque pork with Vietnamese eggrolls and vermicelli (number 23 on the lunch menu). I always ask for extra fish sauce which I really enjoy with this dish. The lettuce and shaved carrots are fresh and crisp, the pork is always done perfectly and the egg rolls are delicious. They add crushed peanuts on the top so beware if you have allergies. I have always found the service to be prompt, attentive and personable even though they are usually very busy at lunch time (particularly on Fridays). I enjoy Pho Kim Long and hope you will as well if you give them a try."

Until they were on dirty dining!  So I was kinda forced into going here just to see how it was and I checked snhd kitchen inspections beforehand,  they checked out with all A's,  perfect. The parking is kinda a hassle since the lot is so narrow but eh whatever, what do they have to do with that,  not their fault.  Walking in its very spacious and they have some nice big fish tanks to keep my toddler occupied.  However the wait to be seated was too long especially since their was no-one to say that they will be right with you. Once seated though the service was quick and friendly.  I ordered a spicy soup with beef and pigs feet, my husband ordered his typical pho with beef and we  had fried eggrolls to start. The eggrolls were really good, very crispy and flavorful,  my husband and I only got to share one since my toddler loved them he ate the other three. Our soups came and I must say I was pleasantly pleased with my soup, the broth had a lot of depth and was just right on the spicy. I added jalapenos and some garlic chili sauce they brought with my bowl. My husband's soup was just okay, nothing special,  but who cares that was his problem.  I finished it all!  Which never happens, I'm always bringing home leftovers. I'm happy to say that we'll be back and I'm very happy that I found a new place to get my pho fix.

They have a bunch of other stuff besides Pho too so if you're craving Asian/Viet this is your place. The Pho Ga (Chicken Noodles) weren't that great but that's my two cents."

They are open 24 hours so a friend and I came here during 3AM after the club. The place was busy during this time, but our food still came out in a timely fashion. Will definitely come back. This place did not get the full five stars despite all of the great things because I like my bun bo hue a little on the sweet and very spicy side. Add chili to the soup just doesn't do the trick..."

The convenience and price of the food is truly what makes up for my rating!!  I'd give it a 5, only sometimes the food isn't always consistent and service is just alright (although I don't expect much from a place with such inexpensive food).  \n\nAnyway, the food I usually eat is pho tai with the steak on the side.  Squeeze in some lime and you're good to go.  I also really like the stir fried beef cubes with seasoned rice.  That dish is always on point.  The grilled pork chops is something I used to always get, but i've noticed that this dish is sometimes poorly prepared (undercooked) so i rarely ever get this anymore.  Spring rolls you can't really go wrong with and the egg rolls are pretty yum too.  That is the extent of my menu knowledge, but i have also tried the  mongolian beef, walnut prawns and some of their vermicelli dishes through my friends.  \n\nOne thing I always get here is the pineapple shake!! YUM!  I've tried their other shakes and noticed them to be a tad bit powdery or artificial tasting.  The pineapple and avocado shakes are the only ones made with milk and fresh fruit, i think, and that's how i like it!!! I'd def recommend you try it."

One of the high points about this place is that it's open 24 hours. I have not yet discovered any other Vietnamese restaurant that is open for 24 hours, so this is a great place for those who are looking to have a filling, healthy dinner after your long night shift. \n\nI can understand why the quality of the pho might not be comparable to some other places (the broth is a little different here than others), but the reason why I gave this place 4 stars is because I would [highly] recommend anyone to be adventurous with the menu. It's typical to order spring rolls, eggrolls, and your pho, but really... there's so much more to the menu than you think, don't be afraid, trust me!\n\nWe ordered rice, the deep fried flounder, walnut shrimp, and coconut milk to go with the meal, and it was quite possibly one of the most flavorful seafood meals I've ever had in a Vietnamese restaurant. I'm usually hesitant with seafood when it comes to restaurants that are reasonably priced and are local establishments, but I have to say the seafood here was fresh, flavorful, and filling. \n\nThe dining area is spacious, not tightly packed together, and the ambience of the restaurant is nice and cultural. Might I add they also have a little selection of liquors from their drink menu too?"

The meat was okay, but there were pieces that did not look appealing.  The service was okay, they were nice.  They were very quick in seating 9 of us, but took forever in coming back to take our orders..We had to flag them down.

There are times I'm here three+ or more nights a week for dinner.  \n\nIt literally is THE BEST pho for the price in Vegas.  It is the closest to what my mother makes!! The broth is always nice and thick (like it should be in good pho).  I can tell they didn't skimp in bone marrow and beef when they cooked it.  The special always has an abundance of meat.  Perfectly sliced beef, not too many tendons, and one of the finer qualities of meatballs (yes there are different ones in the stores that are better in quality).  The meatballs, better in quality you will notice that when you bite into them do not have a lot of those little white fatty pieces (which are disgusting).\n\nThe Goi Cuon looks similarly and perfectly rolled like my aunt's.  They stay in shape bite after bite, without lacking in pork and shrimp on the inside.  Most I've tried around town are either poorly rolled, like they rolled the rice papers too tight so it rips when it dries (also an indicator of freshness).  Or...when you bite into one of these delicious appetizers, all you seem to taste is too much rice paper, then I'd feel ripped off because I feel like I got gipped out of pork and shrimp.\n\nNevertheless, with how big the restaurant is and how busy it is, the servers are attentive.  The service is fast (waiting more than 5 minutes for a bowl of pho is ridiculous since everything is pre-made and just needs to be put together).  There's never a ridiculously long wait for me when I go there for a table (please be respective of the number of people in your party and and what time you arrive)."

It seems that all the owner is thinking about now is maximizing profit. Such is apparent by the reduction in overall quality and waitstaff. Pho broth is bland, food is overpriced in accordance to the price and the service is negligible. I do have to say however their Chinese food isn't half bad. Although I'd rather go to K.J.

He ripped the place a new one over the food - spices were off, dishes were not done properly, etc.  I was genuinely disappointed as I love all kinds of Asian food and wanted to really like this place.  Unfortunately, I think they've gotten a little big for their britches, they know folks are going to show up no matter what and just are phoning it in now. \n\nNow when I want pho I go down a few doors to Fat Dumpling - great pho with all fresh ingredients, no ridiculously long lines, and better price."

As we were immediately seated, they took our order of pho and egg rolls. Like any pho restaurant, their food came out almost as soon as we ordered. The pho broth was light and flavorful. Even the GF that was dying said that there was so much different types of flavor going on in the broth. They also gave generous portions of meat in the pho as well. I would say that their meat to noodle ratio was almost 1:1 unlike the other Pho restaurants that I go to in L.A. \n\nThe price here isn't that inflated as well. A bowl of Pho ran 7-8$ depending on which one you got and the egg rolls were 6$. The egg rolls weren't anything special but they were skinnier than the ones I usually get. \n\nIf you're looking for some good pho (especially after those crazy nights), get off the strip (don't go to the one in TI) and come here.

The rare beef slices and beef brisket were soft and tender, while the beef balls had a nice chewy spring to it. The bean sprouts, basil, jalape\u00f1o and lime were fresh and were the perfect compliment to pho adding a nice crunch and freshness. \n\nMy only gripe is there were no tendons or tripe in the combo nor was there any pho options with them. \n\n*FRESH YOUNG COCONUT ($3.50): The SECRET Hangover Cure!!! Coconut water contains all five of the essential electrolytes: calcium, potassium, phosphorous, magnesium and sodium needed for effective rehydration and has 15 times the amount of potassium as most sports drinks. So this is a MUST order along with your pho if you want to effectively nurse your hangover.\n\nCoconut water taste a little but like metallic water with a very hint sweetness so you can add sugar to it but you should really drink it a la natural. Make sure to eat the creamy flesh of the coconut because it improves insulin secretion and utilization of blood glucose.\n\nS E R V I C E:\nThe staff is incredibly nice, attentive and fast which is rarity for Asian restaurants. Our food came out within 5 minutes which is typical of most pho restaurants and the manager (?) checked on us numerous times to make sure everything was ok. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nDark rich woods, granite tables, various Vietnamese and Chinese shrines, and elaborate fish tanks with exotic fishes create a very nice and upscale environment. \n\nThere are over 25 tables that are well-spaced out, so you don't have to worry about rubbing elbows with your neighbor. \n\nWith the festivities of drunken debauchery that occurred this weekend and the aforementioned scenario in my head, why do I feel like it WILL happen on my next trip to Vegas? *covers eyes*"

It doesn't matter if it's 2am, there is still decent amount of people.\n\nThey have great food. I've tried their appetizers like egg rolls or spring rolls, fried rice, chicken dishes, pad thai, and my personal favorite, their pho. None of them disappointed me ever. I could close my eyes and pick something random on the menu and I guarantee, I'll either love it or at least like it. \n\nI do have problem with their service once in awhile. Sometimes, the server didn't have a very good attitude and was very slow running the food or bringing the check. But besides that, the food is great, the place is great, and the name of the place is great. So go on and try, I guarantee that you won't be disappointed."

We noticed over time the food hasn't been as good, and the service is probably the worst I've ever had. But this visit was the last straw. A friend and I got to the restaurant to grab a table for our party of 7. The wait wasn't long at all. We were seated immediately, but it took our server 18 minutes before I could flag him down just for a drink order. I even timed it because the service there the last few times hasn't been its best. Mind you it wasn't busy compared to its usual hectic environment. We got our drinks and our friends arrived, we were finally ready to order and no one came back to our table for another 20 mins. We had to stop another server and ask him to take our order because apparently our server decided to clock out and was hanging out in the back of the restaurant in his wife beater watching everyone eat like a damn creep. Everyone ordered either an app or just an entree. Not too much food like we usually do. I ordered the chicken pad thai. Everyone got their food except for me. After everyone else got their food, no one else stopped by our table. I got up to tell someone to take what I ordered off the bill because I no longer wanted it. He said ok and walked to the back. A few mins later he came out with my order in a to go box. I told him AGAIN that I no longer wanted it because it took too long. We had to ask 3 different people for our check and that took over 10 mins to get. I honestly don't understand how management can allow such horrible service to their customers. We're no longer coming to this restaurant for any reason what so ever."

Whether it be day time or night or dawn, you can always expect decent portions and decent taste from this place. \n\nWhat really made me a fan was the customer service.

The pho was extremely unimpressive, with a cheap tasting, salty broth that rendered my friend and me overly thirsty for the next twelve hours.

Honestly, if it weren't for the dish's soft tripe, I would have given this place a one-star review. \n\nThe pork chop that my \"aunt\" ordered was greasy and dry at the same time. I didn't think that was possible. It seemed like it had been recooked twice over. \n\nTo add insult to injury, the basic tea was priced western-style at $1 per person. I'm sorry, but this place does not qualify as Asian due to that pricing structure. Tea is part of the dining experience at any formal Asian restaurant. \n\nThe service was cordial but average. \n\nAll of the above being said, if I were to give this restaurant some advice, it would be to remove that silly banner.

One of the things I loved was that they gladly made me a pho that wasn't on the menu:  my favorite combination of chicken and shrimp.  Some places won't do that at all, and others skimp on one or the other.  Not here; both the chicken and the shrimp were bountiful.  They also didn't balk when we asked for extra jalapeno.  In addition, the decor of the place is very appealing, with none of that garish lighting and wretched music that plagues too many Oriental restaurants.

The veggies are yummy too! Green beans, bok choy etc... if this place was closer to where I live I'd be there every few days guaranteed! Open one closer to Henderson pllllease!!! As far as the service goes, it's spotty. Everyone is very nice, it's just we always have to ask for our check and no one ever has checked on us to see if we needed anything. Regardless - I'll be back for the food cuz it's THAT good."

Plus the place was probably the cleanest Pho place I've ever been to. Will definitely go here again!"

(hence the name)  Gotta love a good name \"pho\" a restaurant!\n\nBrought some out of town friends here on Monday (Labor Day) around 1pm.  People were everywhere inside and outside waiting.  I almost gave up immediately but my inner gut & the \"best of RJ's\" on the windows made me stay.  When we finally made our way to the front to put our name in we asked the guy how long the wait was.  His reply, \"really fast\".  I couldn't help but chuckle but who are we to argue. LOL\n\nSurprisingly, our wait wasn't too long before our name was called.  With all the people everywhere I was halfway expecting to be waiting a while.  We were seated by a window.  Literally every table full.  A guy came to take our drink order.  While we checked out the menu every meal was numbered making it easy to order.  Each item had a detailed description underneath for white girls like me or at least I'd like to think. haha  BTW the menu is gigantic.  I'm often overwhelmed by such menus but I knew what I was looking for.  My BF and I decided we would share each of our orders so we could try a couple different dishes.  We had settled on two things to share until I heard my friend say...UDON Noodle!  I just discovered Udon Noodles when I was in Cali. I honestly cannot have enough of it.  To describe it to someone I would say its like a really thick soft spaghetti noodle.  Here is what we ordered:\n\n*Beef Udon Noodle - I thought it was fantastic.  The BF thought it was a little peppery (you could actually see the black pepper in it) but it was still our favorite.\n*Chicken Pho - A little bland broth flavor (I remember it being better), chunks of chicken, thin rice noodles.  We added a bunch of hot sauce to spice it up and give it a little more flavor. Pretty good even though it felt like it was the hottest/humid day of the summer.  We did only eat half the soup.  The bowl was as big as my head.\n*Our friends also got the Beef Udon and love it.  They also got the Teriyaki Chicken with Rice and it was a huge portion.  She only had half of it.\n\nWe waited a bit for the check.  The servers were running around like crazy but she eventually came.  Our bill came to around $70 I believe-our friends had bought.  Overall it was good.  Just super crazy busy.  This is definitely a popular spot.\n\nThe reviews say that its opened 24 hours.  I cant imagine really wanting a drunken night soup bowl at 3am but it sounds like a lot of people do.  (I secretly opt for a drunken night Fat Burger at that time-but that's just me) but if its your thang have at it!  Its there for your enjoyment!  24 hours."

I like the pho with thin sliced beef and brisket, it's really tasty and the veggies they put on the table for you to add are always super fresh.  The bean sprouts actually are fresh enough that you can hear a snap if you break them in half.  Good, fast service, decent prices, and a clean and busy restaurant make this a good choice if you're in the Chinatown area.  Big plus for being open 24/7."

The pho only comes in two sizes small or large. If you're from a state that has tons of pho restaurants (e.g colorado, Cali..) their large is like a medium at the restaurants in colorado. \n\nThe pho was okay. I guess I'm spoiled because the pho in Denver is just amazing. What I didn't like was their meatballs, it had a really weird taste, like it had just been thawed from the freezer or something. The veggies that were served with the pho were definitely old. I always eat basil with my pho, but I just couldn't bring myself to eat theirs. They also forgot to bring out our spring rolls, which we ended up canceling... i guess when you're that busy... it's bound to happen.\n\nService was quick and the servers were nice during the little interactions that we had.

And when I do crave for pho I am extremely picky since most places put way too much MSG. I am not a fan of pho kim long in the bay and I am still not a fan of it in Vegas. The broth to me is very medicore with too much MSG. Meh. We didn't have a chance to look around to see if there are other pho restaurants in the area since we wanted something to eat and then head back to the hotel to catch some ZZZzz."

            "review": "Okay... Vegas may not be San Jose or LA's Little Saigon when it comes to Vietnamese food. However, with that being said, this joint really isn't too shabby either.\n\nPho Kim Long (that name will never cease to get a chuckle out of me) is the go-to late night spot to get your drunk grub on. I've been here way too many times for my own good, as my state of sobriety while eating here is usually (although not always!) questionable. Regardless, the food is solid and the locals seem to love it.\n\nWhen I came to Vegas this past June for EDC (yep, as in the Electronic Daisy Carnival 2012 ---- suuuuch a crazy experience, btw), company preferred ordering family style dishes like shaking beef, ong choy, pork spare ribs etc. Everything was quite tasty and portions were ample, but I got the impression that this place catered more to American tastes. The dishes, while yummy in my tummy, were more like something you might find in a mainstream Chinese restaurant than authentic Viet food. Still, no real complaints as it was delicious nevertheless.\n\nDuring my last trip over Halloween weekend, though, I ordered more \"true\" Viet fare like seafood noodle soup and Bun Bo Hue. I was surprised that the taste and quality were above average. Definitely better than Tung Kee Noodlehouse and probably better than a good portion of pho spots back home! I can see why the locals took me here so often because if *I* was local, I'd probably become a regular too.\n\nHowever, here's the issue:\n\nNOT being a local, I'm on vacation. And should be eating Vegas-y thangs. Elsewhere. Thangs that are NOT pho. Since I can get plenty of it. Authentic, at that. At home.\n\nSo...... basically......\n\nEat it if you're a local, eat if you're drunk and broke, eat it if you want Viet food while in Vegas. Heck, I'd do the same. If none of these things apply, though? And you have a choice to eat something else? I would. Because dammit, it's called a vacation. Feed me fancy things. Because that's what I want. Hence.... 3 stars."

            "review": "You would think that a place like this would be the Mecca of late night grubbing in Chinatown, but sadly this place really isn't that good. The food quality isn't really the best, and the whole experience was just subpar.\n\nThe people working there, from the hostess to the waiter, were surly and gave attitude when seating us and taking our order. It wasn't really that busy inside because I think everything is a little slower in Vegas during this time of the year (people going back home from their vacations, the school year starting, etc.). I feel like at any dining establishment, the staff should at least try and be a little friendly... That's not the case here.\n\nAnyway, onto the food. My friend and I ordered their crab rangoons, shrimp udon dish, and their shrimp fried rice.\n\nWhen the crab rangoons came to our table, my initial thought was \"WHAT ARE THOSE?!\" because they didn't look like the conventional flower-shaped rangoons we are all (mostly) familiar with. They looked like they were made in a rush, but at least they retained the cheesy crab flavored filling. Fried to a golden-brown, these are a good appetizer to start off with.\n\nThe shrimp udon dish was basically filler (loads of green onions and bean sprouts) and a few sizeable shrimp. The noodles, which should be the main part of the dish, were lacking. The presentation wasn't too appealing, either. It literally looked like it was stirred and thrown onto the plate to go out to our table...\n\nThe shrimp fried rice was probably the only thing we really enjoyed out of everything we ordered. The shrimp seemed to be smaller in this dish compared to the shrimp in the udon, and even with the smaller sized shrimp, it was still sparing. The Sriracha sauce is the perfect thing to drizzle on top of the fried rice, I can't get enough of the unique spiciness it offers!\n\nAnyway, if we're talking about food quality and presentation, then Pho Kim Long is in the same league as any average Asian take-out place... which isn't saying much. Pho Kim Long misses the mark on so many things: friendly staff, decent food, presentation of said food, cleanliness, etc. \n\nOverall, I did not have an enjoyable experience. I think that maybe it's alright if you're on the hot mess express at 3 AM and want something to eat in the late hours of the night/early morning, but even that is a BIG maybe for me... Save your appetite for something better."

He was so rude asking what I ordered when I clearly did not know the exact numbers for my table. He ended up getting mad at ME because HE couldn't find my check.

Mostly lunch dates.\nService: I have been coming here since 2008ish and it has slowly just gotten worse over time. The wait staff is always rushing you. I think it is ridiculous to be asked 4 times by the same time if you are ready to order within a 7 minute span. It makes you feel like \"Hey we don't want to satisfy you, we just want your money and for you to leave.\" We got our food and halfway through our meal a lady came over and gave us our check, said thank you, and asked us are we done? My friend and I were both literally sitting with utensils in hand and half eaten plates of food. \"No... We aren't\" I commented to my friend under my breath about how rude that was and she must've heard because she came back and took the check away. It has been feeling this rushed since they underwent their makeover a while ago.\nFood: the pho is delicious, all the rice noodle/egg roll combination dishes are amazing. I mean I would walk on hot coals if their egg rolls were waiting for me on the other side. I have never had an issue with any food being bad. But I love their calamari and sometimes it is amazing and sometimes, well, it is just deep fried squid.\nCheck it out and decide for yourself.\nThe egg rolls are the only thing that stop me from giving it 3 stars."

There are lots of pho places around Vegas where he lives, So when he wants  this even at midnight, Pho Kim Long is his go to place. They also make some decent Chinese food. Some of the tables around us had your usual pan fried noodles, whole fried fish, and sweet and sour pork.  But most people had pho. \n\nAlthough more salty than I personally like, the simple broth and noodles has a light, nice aroma served in a large bowl.  Add meat, like rare steak slices, along with some condiments, like basil, bean sprouts, and onions ($7), it was an awesome meal in itself.  I was going to order the same thing, but for the same price, you can get a half rotisserie small chicken with rice.  It was crispy on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside ($7). So simple, yet so good.\n\nCustomers are mostly families during the day till early evening.  After that, they're the winners and mostly losers from the casinos, and sobering drunken clubbers and night shift workers. The inside is comofrtable and nicely appointed with ample booths or tables. During lunch dinner. no matter what day, it is crowded.  Finding a parking spot, however, is a war of patience and luck.  Fortunately, a guy was pulling out just as we walked inside, so we didn't have to exhibit our Type A parking lot Ninja tactics. While waiting to be seated, I enjoyed their relaxing goldfish tanks. \n\nThis place is so typical Vegas with a Vietnamese and Chinese twist. I'd go back to try a few more dishes.  Service was good, prompt with the soda ($2) refills and special requests, and making sure all was OK."

My take here are decor is ok, so is the food, service is unpredictable, and the prices are varied.\n     The dining room is buddhist-like temple  theme which is more of a cross between Chinese and Vietnamese.  There are lots of buddha figurines in different sizes.  The fresh water fish tank is nice with expensive variety of fishes. The plants need to be taken care of because they are covered with dust.  The restroom needs to be clean because toilet paper are all over the floor.  By the way they haven't upkept since the remodeling.  The place needs better ventilation because I can smell lot of pho flavors when first entered.  \n     The beef noodle soup here is reasonable.  First, the soup come out really fast.  The broth has a distinct cinnamon flavor, which is typical.  I prefer a balance flavor broth.  The price for the beef noodle soup is fair.  The seafood soup here is overpriced because the content in the soup are 3 pieces of shrimp, 2 fishballs, 3 slices of cuttlefish, and egg noodle in a blanched broth.  The BBQ duck is tasty which has a balance flavor of crispy skin, duck with fair amount of meat,  and good price.\n     The service is unpredictable.  They have all male servers with a serious look on their faces most of the time.  You have to ask for service. One upswing is  they give you the right utensil for your needs.  The 17% gratuity is added with five or more in your party.  Since there is not much service that seems rediculous.  You can't split check, boomer.\n  Their non-alcohol prices are more than their beers.  Might as well order a beer for your thirst.

They had HUGE signs of Live Crawfish posted everywhere and when we asked they said they didn't have it.  They really should have taken the banner and signs down.  Would I come back here?  Nahhhh... Was it bad?  Not really.  If you just want to satisfy your Vietnamese craving, then I guess this place wouldn't be too bad."

Fornicate him for an extended period of time. .. Comedy gold."

Comfort food = pho!  We stumbled upon Pho Kim Long after a little drive and our party of 6 was seated immediately!  I know Vegas is a city that doesn't sleep, but even at 12:30 am and 5 minutes away from the strip, this place was still pretty busy!  After eating here, I understand why!  The pho quality is so good!  The soup is delicious and the service is excellent!  Yes!  And actual pho establishment with great service!  Their portions are the perfect size and it comes out fast!  My taste buds were pleasantly surprised.  This place is so good, I plan on visiting again the next time I'm in Vegas.  In the meantime, if you are in Vegas and need some comfort food, come here and check it out!!  You won't be disappointed!"

There was a decent amount of customers even at this hour.  30 mins into our meal it got pretty crowded.  \n\nOn to the food. I had NO idea what to order.  I looked around me and the girl next to me had something that looked interesting.  She was sitting by herself and looked like she was really enjoying her meal.  I asked the waiter what is she eating.  He said Honey Garlic Pork Chop.  So hubby and I ordered that and shared it with two orders of rice.  OMG!!!! It was amazing.  It was probably one of the best things ever.  I highly recommend that you just TRY IT.  You got nothing to lose while in Vegas (foodwise).  Anyways, even hubby was skeptical and was like what the heck are you ordering just based on what the next table is eating.  He loved it.  We are foodies and have pretty good palates.  We loved it. \n\nOnly complaint is that they charge per serving of rice.  To me this is almost unheard of for a Viet restaurant.  I was very surprised but they give you a decent amount.  However, come on...it's like charging for bread at an Italian restaurant or salsa at a Mexican restaurant or pita at a Greek place or Naan at an Indian restaurant.  It's just not done.  So, one star off for this. \n\nHowever, I still highly recommend since the entree was so good and they are open 24 hrs."

This is one of the places where the broth is so good you'd clean the entire bowl out. It's addicting how good the pho is here. My equally just as good favorite dish to order here is the calamari. It's literally the best calamari I've ever had. They deep fry in a way that isn't super crispy but also is kind of soft in a way. I don't know how they do it but its the perfect deep fried texture. Also, the portion that they give is enormous! It was just two of us and we couldn't kill the entire plate of calamari.\n\nService:\nService here is okay. They seat you quickly if it's not busy and the food comes out quick. If you get pho, it always comes out before anything else does. The waiters were quick with the refills but if you're there for a while the service get slower and slower. It took us a while for them to realize I was trying to flag them down. Then it took even longer for them to get the check out to us. Service here is my only complaint.\n\nBest part to this restaurant is that it's open 24 hours so you can get your pho craving in anytime.\n\nTLDR; Good Pho and Calamari. Bad service."

This place has totally surpassed its name by remotely being called \"F**cking Long\" by many. It utterly appears to me as having one of the quickest service.. almost as fast as McDonalds.\n\nSince I first came to this place, the quality of the restaurant itself had changed dramatically.. only for the good though! Since the management changed a couple of times, the cleanliness of the environment had skyrocketed. There used to be an open area seafood, like the tanks you would see at 99 Ranch or any other Asian market, which was cool and all, but they got rid of it and added an extra table. The drinking water (thank god) was also one of the many things that they had switched around! Oh yea, I think they charge on soda refills, so beware!\n\nOf course, for food, you would most likely end up ordering the Pho whether it would be the soup or rice noodles, for example, the common  Pho Dac Biet (combination noodles). Sadly, they're kind of mean with the meatballs :( I would only see one floating around. On the other hand, also try the charbroiled pork chop, that one is pretty bomb as well. \n\nGirls, if you're looking for some Viet men or some late night attention, they would gladly tend to your needs and ignore majority of the customers. Don't forget, if there are other groups of girls who come in who, lets say, came back from clubbing, you would immediately become one of the rejectees and may have some difficulty getting employee attention. Real shit, they kind of flirt way too much. I know it's common elsewhere but sometimes.. I just want to eat my food and be treated equally! :\\"

But it makes me just as happy as it did when I was younger. The pho broth is pretty good. I always try my broth before I mix in any of the sauces and this broth tastes good by itself. guess it's not consistent because I hear bad things and there are times when the place is a lot busier.  I'm pretty sure if its a place my old folks and fam still love, then it isnt so bad!\n\nThe wait is always long on weekends for lunch, but I always see the servers moving quickly to clean tables and arrange the seating so that everyone can be seated faster.

Their rating on it is exactly why I took my girlfriend out to it after a night at a ballet.\n\nIt was a Saturday night, and we were promptly seated.  I was happy about this, but they sat us at a nearly 8 person round.  Kind of odd and peculiar, but we were hungry so the size of the table didn't bother us.  We started with spring rolls, a favorite appetizer of hers.  They were good.  Hard to mess those up, and I can say they didn't do that.\n\nOur waiter became the center of attention during our private conversation.  He didn't say much, just got our order and left.  He essentially threw our drinks and Pho down when he served it.  I know it was a busy night, but he just seemed completely disinterested in his job.  Several times he came to our table to fill supplies at other tables with customers.  He'd grab five or six spoons from our table, and put them on another table.  He took some chopstix and fill the empty holder on another.  Eventually we overheard others also noting his absent charm.  Where they found him to be a waiter is beyond me.  He should be retrained on how to do his job, or be demoted to customer.\n\nOur Pho was eventually served to us and we both began eating.  She ordered the chicken and I ordered the brisket.  As far as flavors went, I didn't notice anything out of the norm.  Neither did she.  I finished my Pho, and she asked for a to go container.  When she asked for it, the busser sarcastically joked and said it would be $5 and just for that I felt compelled to tip beyond the lack of service.\n\nShe got the container and we left.  She noted that the waiter, seemingly looking for a larger tip he didn't earn, when he picked up the bill flipped us off upon our exit.  Very classy for an establishment named after a sexual innuendo.\n\nWhen she went to have the remaining Pho at our home, SHE FOUND A WATER BUG FLOATING AND FLICKING ITS LEGS ACROSS THE PHO bouncing its body off of the container's inner foam walls.  To the trash her pho went....as well as their reputation in our household."

Pretty good.  I do not reccomend their bun bo hue: the meat had no flavor, it's kinda grey, as if it was merely boiled in water.  The chili does come separate though if you can't handle spiciness.  The pho was decent, it has the strong anise star aroma.  An order of eggrolls included 4 of them with veggies.  I'm not sure what the price was but they were small fast food type eggrolls.\n\nIf you eat here i recommend trying to be seated in the separate bar/lounge room.

It was pretty good, but just in general I don't like the water in Las Vegas, which didn't make this the best pho for me and I always feel queasy when I drink water outside of where I live, but it did its job of feeding me.\n\nOverall I had pretty good service, food came out fast and the dishes itself were pretty good.

If you're not after ambiance and you don't mind the rowdiness, go for it for the food and the fast service! Besides, how can you go wrong with the name!"

The broth was tasteful and still hot and they provide you with so much stuff to put in it and they didn't skimp on anything.\nEgg rolls - 4 stars typical fried egg rolls, but it was delicious!\nSpring Rolls - 3 stars - The roll was good but I didn't like the dipping sauce. :( which knocked off a star."

When it was our turn, she just led us to the table and threw the menu on the table and left. Waited some time before a server came to take order and haha... another one who's annoyed by overwhelmed traffic.\n\nWe ordered fried tofu, spring rolls, whole coconut and two Bun Bo Hue; food came out fairly quickly but the quality wasn't as good as I expected it, well, when I compare to what we usually have here in the South Bay. I did like the fried tofu and coconut and that's why I'm keeping two stars here; however, the spring rolls was not fresh and the soup base for their Bun Bo Hue was so bland, it didn't have pork blood or beef/brisket in them either. \n\nWill not recommended until you're dying of hunger."

Both times were at two extremes, but I know for certain that this place does get really packed during peak times. The restaurant is so big, so the wait time isn't nearly as bad as it feels with so many people around. The most recent time I was here, we counted a total of 25 parties ahead of our name, but our party of 7 got seated within 45 minutes, so all in all, pretty reasonable. We unfortunately got stuck sitting in the back room which seems like an extension of the restaurant with what looks to be like an old kitchen counter in the back. Not an ideal seating arrangement, but it was spacious so it worked.\n\nOur table got an order of eggrolls, which tasted pretty much like your average Vietnamese eggrolls. I ordered the #15 Pho Tai Chin, which was rare steak and brisket and was amazing. Perfect size portion and the broth was so soothing for the cold day. There is plenty of meat and noodles in the bowl and the whole thing was the perfect temperature and full of flavor. Highly recommend!"

Also, I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes to get seated here. Not only is this place open till the wee hours of night, long after you've consumed multiple shots of alcohol and danced your booty off, but there's nothing better to cure a typical Vegas hangover than some MORNING-AFTER PHO!! I know there's now places to get pho on the Strip, but Pho Kim Long tastes authentic and you can get a decent meal for under 10 bucks. \n\nI love this place. And it's a cult favorite. Literally every time I go I unintentionally run into someone I either know from 1) my sorority, 2) Los Angeles, or 3) other random people.\n\nVirtually everyone who's a Vegas regular knows about this place and has been here.\n\nAnd FYI - I have also had pho here when I was NOT drunk, and enjoyed it!\n\nRecently they've had a restaurant makeover, making the place more classy. Yes, you can expect to see people there of all ages - from seniors, to children, to under dressed club hos.\n\nParking is easy as it is located in a small Asian strip mall. It's also about a 10-15 minute drive from the Strip, which is not exactly pedestrian friendly but definitely worth the trip if you have a car."

The menu is visual and multiple pages so you can actually get lost trying to make a decision.  It can be pretty packed in the evening,  and nearly impossible to get a seat in under 30 minutes in the early am after the clubs let out.  The staff is pretty attentive and gets food out in about 15-20 minutes after its ordered.  The dishes are served family style,  meant to be shared,  but i often eat an entire dish to myself.  I usually order the delicious spring rolls (cold),  the deep fried tofu pillows,  and either the seafood phad thai,  or the honey walnut shrimp,  which melts in your mouth.  I highly recommend pho kim long.  The fact that it is 24 hours, makes this a super useful spot to get your Vietnamese good fix anytime of the day or night!\n\nCheers! \n\n-MikeB"

It was surprisingly very nice and clean for a Vietnamese restaurant, but maybe I'm too used to 'the dirtier, the better' mentality of Viet restaurants in Little Saigon. \n\nThey had a huge selection to satisfy all of your Vietnamese and Chinese cravings, not just pho. However, I just got my usual Pho Ga (I loove dipping chicken in the ginger sauce). Definitely DE-LISH!\n\nIt definitely had the whole Vietnamese-people-running-around-busy atmosphere. They were too busy running around that they forgot to bring one of our friend's bowls... and she was the only one sitting there without any food when everyone else had ordered the exact same thing. Goodness.\n\nBut I'm glad to know that I can always satisfy my late-night-after-clubbing pho craves. YAYY~"

The wait time has been about 20 minutes each time I've gone. You can get pho to go which is awesome, and they definitely don't skimp on the amount they give you--I almost never finish it all. I go back and forth between the 14 (rare beef pho) and 15 (rare beef and brisket). Both are amazing. Great flavor and is consistently good. I read some reviews saying the calamari wasn't good, but I have to disagree. I think it's great. A little greasy, but great flavor. I love the seasoning they use on top. I will continue to come here when I visit, and would recommend it to friends. It is Pho Kim awesome."

I know what you're saying right this minute, uhhhh how are you a pescetarian then? Well, my friend ordered it I ate one  of the green beans with my rice and immediately had a culinary orgasm. (whoa girl!) I ended up eating like all of them, but she said the steak was tender and juicy and whatever makes red meat good (that's what she said), not into it but those accompaniments were the business! The Thai iced tea doesn't come with refills and that sucks because I can drink like 8 of those. right now. Let's go. Woman vs Drink.

The Male waiter was short and unfriendly too, got our order and disappeared , forgot the spoons. \n\nThe food was ok but ruined by RUDE service and the following: My guest (which happens to run a million dollar restaurant)  requested carbonated water from the soda tap (gas bubbles and water).... when we got the bill they charged it as a full flavored soda \n\n3 dollars for carbonated water! \nwe questioned it since nowhere else in AMERICA they charge for Co2 and water, they went to get the manager (which claimed to be the owner). That younger male with an attitude of a major jerk, leaned on the table with both \"fists\" on the table, leaned over into our personal space and asked: whats your problem! \n\nThe question of why in the name of everything that is 100% free anywhere in America he was charging 3 dollars for carbonated water and with a major attitude and tone of voice he said: \n\n\"I don't care if I lose a customer that doesn't want to pay for carbonated water, Its 2.99 and I will not remove it from the bill\" .\n\nNeedless to say the rude waiters did not get tip and I will never go back and I will never suggest this hole again.

I'd never been before and while the parking lot can be a bit of a challenge, once inside it's rather spacious and well-decorated.\n\nOur party of 8 got sat quickly even with several names before us on the list.  It took a bit for the ordering and the food, but nothing awful.  What was kind of a bummer is we ordered boba, appetizers and entrees - the appetizers and entrees came at appropriate times but the boba came halfway through the entree.  I don't know if that was on purpose or not, but everyone in my group thought it would have arrived first.\n\nSpring rolls were a bit chewy but the overall taste was ok. The peanut dipping sauce was good.\n\nTheir bun thit nuong cha gio (grilled sliced pork & fried egg rolls over cold vermicelli and vegetables) is actually better than some of the other places I've tried in town, but I felt it was more expensive with less food.  Chalk that up to the 24-hour convenience, I suppose.\n\nCoconut milk slush boba was pretty good, especially for a place that isn't a standalone boba shop.\n\nMy friend let me try some of his pho broth and I do have to say it's pretty darn tasty.\n\nSeveral people at my table ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and said it had some sort of a weird/bad aftertaste.  I didn't try it, but considering half the table did and that was their response it was worth mentioning.\n\nIf I was in the area, it'd be a toss-up if I came back.  I'd probably just order take-out and hope it doesn't get cold on my drive back to Green Valley."

Yeah yeah this place is full of Michelin 5-Star places, but oh lordy lord is this place good. I think it's one of the best vietnamese spots in the U.S and I'm comparing it to hubs in LA/Little Saigon/Dallas/Boston and other major vietnamese hubs. I tell everyone I know in the Boston area to come here and they agree that this place rocks.\n\nI will say the one thing I don't enjoy is the service for it is a typical asian restaurant experience - sub par. Also, the spring rolls aren't so great, but everything else from pho, com tam, mi xao don, cha gio and the drinks are worth it!\n\nPS - though this place is open 24/7, they will deny service if they can't handle it. Happened to me during EDC last year. I just left to change some clothes and came back in like 20 mins."

I can't taste the beef broth that is supposed to be cooked for hours to develop this deep flavor, added with the specific spice that gives pho this mouthwatering aroma. And that's unacceptable for a place that is opened 24/7. You should be able to monitor and develop the flavor of your broth. The beef is cut so thinly, I was expecting soft and flavorful. Nope, I assume you have to freeze your beef in order to cut it this thinly and somehow they've manage to lose all the flavor from the meat. I felt like I was eating \"soggy meat\". Did that sound nasty to you? Yes? It was. My fatty flank, there were two pieces with decent fat on it that gave my one spoon of noodle flavor because I scarcely used any soup. The rest of my fatty flank was chewy. The meatball? NEVER. Like no. The taste was not utterly unbearable, but the texture was wrong. \n\nPs. My bf says the restroom is disgusting. I'm more of a germaphobe, so this coming from him holds more accuracy."

But when I got there after 1 HOUR  the manager will say that it's NOT YET READY, that I have to WAIT ANOTHER 20 minutes for them to get me the soup.

You can't go wrong with picking this restaurant if you're craving Asian food and can't pick between soup, noodles, or stir fried. They have a variety of food.

Sometimes the service is quick and on point. They kind of rush you so the next group of people can sit down, though. But, if the wait is 15-20 minutes long, at least let us sit down and enjoy our food for that long. Other times, even if business is slow, the service is slow and poor. Every time I've gone, my food always comes before my drink surely. My drink seems to always come when I'm half way done with my food whether I order a smoothie, tea, specialty drink, or coffee."

The service was so bad I was tempted to just walk out. The food was ok at best. Then, the best part happened. This young waiter/cashier started yelling at a customer, getting all up in his face and his girl's face. It was crazy! I don't know what the customer did but I'm pretty sure you're not suppose to threaten them if you work there. After all that, we waited for 20 min for our check without ever getting refills. Then, these 2 Asian girls walked in. They clearly know the waiter guy. They got seated right away with 5 plates of food on their table PLUS the fucking check within 10min. So in conclusion, fuck that place, there's always white castle."

The hostess in the front desk was pretty cool, but not the rest of the staff.  Sadly that is about the only good thing I can say about this place.  Now on to the rest of the review.\n\nI visited this place because I was in the mood for some pho and happen noticed this place while driving by.  Dropped in and the first thing was the massive waiting line to be seated.  There were lots of people waiting outside too.  Waiting outside on a HOT summer day is not fun.  After 30 minutes of waiting, we were finally called and seated.  This is where everything started to go down hill from here.\n\nWe were seated and we knew what we wanted because we were looking over the menu while we were waiting, so we ordered a coconut drink, the regular pho bowl and spring rolls.  The server wrote that down on his notepad and just disappeared.  We waited for at least 30 minutes and not one single item we ordered arrive on our table.  We then started to notice people that were seated after us got their order and they were chomping away.  After about 40 minutes of wait time I was wondering how long it takes to make just a simple coconut drink.  Are they sending a monkey to climb up a coconut tree to retrieve the coconut or something?\n\nWe finally saw our waiter and asked him to check on our order and he returned back to us to let us know they were out of spring rolls, therefore they did not make the pho or the coconut drink.  The thing was, the server said it in a way where it was OUR fault that we ordered something they ran out of and that's why they couldn't complete our order.  I just don't understand how when they ran out of one item that is no way related to the other items on the order could prevent the entire order to be made.  It's not like it was a combo or something.  I understand if I ordered a #1 at Mc Donalds and they tell me they ran out of fries, then I would order something else, not make me wait 30 minutes and tell me they are out of fries therefore they can't make the burger.  I really wanted to tell the server to GTFO here cause there is no way you run out of spring rolls in a Vietnamese pho restaurant.  It's the second most popular dish right after pho.  Its like a chinese restaurant running out of rice.  This is a MEGA CATASTROPHIC EPIC FAIL.  \n\nThe food finally arrived after putting in our order the second time, but the coconut drink did not.  I was about to take off my shoes and go out back to get the coconut down from the tree myself.  The pho dish was OK to average at best!  After waiting 45 minutes of waiting I have the right to have high expectations.  The size of the bowl was really small.  I wonder if they gave us the kids size bowl by mistake.  I can't believe they charge $8 for this kid size bowl of pho.  I can get a bowl of pho that is twice the size for $5-$6 at home!  The coconut drink finally arrived about halfway into finishing our food.  The drink was meh.  \n\nIn the end, the food was average, but the customer service just left a really bitter taste in my mind.  People think it is a good thing that they are open 24 hours.  No guys, that is not a good thing, they are there to FAIL 24 hrs a day.  Would you like to go to a place that fails 8-10 hrs a day or 24 hrs?  I personally would rather go to a place that FAILS less."

Opened 24 hours  and on Spring Mountain Rd, this place is great for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the late night hang over snack. But be warned, normal wait time can be  anywhere between 30 min to over an  hour as this place is busy as ever.\n\nWe ordered  Pho Tai (rare beef), Bun bo hue (it's like a vermicelli noodle soup with different types of beef and you can add this spicy sauce to it), and the Cam bo luc lac (diced tender beef with steamed rice).  The Pho soup has amazing flavors and is rich in texture, but their small and large isn't much of  a difference in bowl size so I'd recommend opting for the large. I can't say much about comparing bun bo  hue to other restaurants as it was my first time, but I'm a fan! My only grip is that I wish they had given more meat for the bo  luc lac dish...it seemed on the skimpier side but the flavors were really delicious.\n\nStaff is very attentive for refills, taking empty plates away, and utensil requests. Ambience is clean,  surprisingly  spacious, and constantly busy. Next time I return to Vegas, I can't wait to return to Pho Kim Long!"

The regular bowl was a good size. It had just enough noodles and soup. Though it would've been better if they added more brisket and steak. Gotta love that extra meat! Waiters seemed funny here probably because I couldn't fully understand their jokes but I guess it made up for the o-k service. The extra star really belonged to the desserts I tried on my recent visit. There were these ice cream balls called exotic bomba and bomba. (Filipinos, don't get any dirty ideas!) Both were actually pretty good. The exotic bomba had a fruitier taste coated with white chocolate and the bomba had a coffee taste coated with milk chocolate.

I was hesitant at first to pick this spot.  Many of the previous reviews had mentioned about the waiters being rude.  We are from New York, we know what rude is!! We didn't have any problem here.  \n\nDeco:  it was very simple, many big family tables.  My bf and I were seated at a table that fits 6 people.  We had the entire table to ourselves, even though there were people waiting for a seat.  In NY Viet restaurants, they would easy make you share a table with total strangers!  Overall, the restaurants and waiters seems somewhat clean.\n\nFood:  I had the pho with sliced raw beef.  The broth was very tasty.  I very much enjoyed it.  I have to say that it was comparable to the pho in NY.  It tasted just as good but cleaner.  It sounds strange but if had the pho from pho bang in ny, you would know what I mean.  \n\nService: the waiter was attentive and quick.  I'm there for the food, not to make friends.  I just got out of airport security, 5 hrs flight, 1 hr car rental line, I just want quick good food!  This Viet pho spot definitely satisfied my taste buds and made the trip well worth it."

After years and years of experiencing a multitude of underground culinary gems to the most decadent restaurants, I've come across a restaurant that was the catalyst to my finally making an account. And hey, I have 4 hours to kill before I'm back in Cali ;-) Unfortunately, though it was an appalling experience that lead me to officially being here, it'll certainly open the floodgates to my culinary soap box for the good experiences as well :)\n\nAnyway, I digress.. I've been to PKL several times over the years, and it truly has topped itself in the degradation of service each time. I came here with my in laws, parents, fianc\u00e9, aunt and uncle, to complete our Vegas Christmas gift to them filled with cirque shows, spas, and enough slot machine pulling to make my mom grow a baby bicep. It was 830 am on Sunday, and the restaurant couldn't have been filled more than a quarter capacity. The PKL gentlemen in the front didn't even look at us and started walking us to the back where he threw a few menus down. I immediately thought it was rude, but figured he may have been having a bad morning. Moving on... \n\nWhen we were seated Raymond our server stopped by to bring some glasses of water. My uncle, who was tickled to be here, asked him what the gentlemen next to our table was eating, since it looked delicious. Raymond didn't even glance at the other table, and immediately responded \"I don't know.\". So in jest my uncle says \"if you walk over a couple feet, you may have a better idea\". He tells us it's pho, walks away, and is no where to be found for the next 15 min. Finally I flag James/Jason, the older server with  spikey hair, that we're ready to order. Agitated, he walks over to collect our order. Each dish we named, he responded with disdain and contempt. My little old mommy didn't know that one of the broken rice orders came with a choice of 2 meats, and he begins yelling at her \"which one do you want?!!!? I can do double meat!!!! Just let me know!!!\". Which was totally unnecessary since she must've been confused for no more than 5 seconds. I would've walked out right there and hopped over to lee's, but a couple of the parents wanted to stay since we already ordered most of the food. Needless to say the food was delivered by the same disgruntled James/Jason. The food (pho, broken rice, clams, water spinach, tofu and pad thai) was served cold and they forgot two of the orders until we reminded them.  Annoyed that large parties get automatically charged 17% for gratuity.\n\nAnyway, won't ever be back and suspect their sign that says \"voted best pho in Vegas\" was just something the owner thought of printing while he was on the can... Because it sure isn't true :)"

Nobody at my table cared and our conversation moved on to gambling talk. Then, the bus boy strolled up to our table and instead of asking if everything was alright, rudely said \"how do you know my fiance, and why are you talking about her\". I almost started laughing because a thought it was a joke, but the guy was mad. \n\nI walked up to the manager and expressed my concern, then I asked the girl why her fiance was bugging us. She said she is not engaged, and definitely not to the bus boy, lol. Then mysteriously the bus boy became silent and disappeared. The kitchen cleared out like there was going to be a fight, in fact the waiter called them up front like an old kung fu movie. It was disrespectful to all the customers, my table, the girl, and embarrassing to mgmt and the bus boy. \n\nWhat a weird place, I also think he might have thought we were talking about the girl because my fiend's name is genny and maybe that was her name, but what a bunch of foolishness. \n\nEither way, if you are not trying out for a kung fu movie where you have to fight the whole staff, I suggest going elsewhere. This is not the best pho, and they are not the best listeners. They are quick to judge. It smells and has bugs. \n\nI will be sure to only stop here if I have to take a dump."

Vegas, you really do have something for everyone!\n\nAfter a night of enthusiastic fist pumping to Armin van Buurin at Marquee, our arms were sore, our feet were hurting, and our stomachs were empty. My friends had already gone the night before (in a limo, no less -- we do it big in Vegas), but pho just really seemed to be a really good idea. \n\nThe taxi line was monstrous but we managed to squeeze into a 5-person taxi and off we went to pho heaven! The small bowls were big, the broth was brothy, the noodles were noodly, and the meat was definitely meaty. The basil was so basily my friend couldn't help putting several branches in his mouth like a koala. Pho really is the best drunk/hangover food ever.\n\nIn the words of one of my dear EAP friends... \"MM, this really hits the SPOT! I'm not sure which spot it is, but it's hitting it!\"\n\nAlso, I love that they have a large man standing in the front who opens the door for you. Is he a bouncer? A door-opener? Who knows??"

Waiting for a table has never taken long, but forget getting refills on your drinks or checking on how the food is. Your order is taken, your food is brought out, and good luck finding somebody to bring you the check.

There was no one at the front desk so I couldn't even ask how long the wait would be. Finally once a large group got seated I was able to see that there was a sign in sheet. After that we waited about 10 min to be seated. Once we were seated no one seemed to want to take our order. For the amount of people there, you would think there would be more workers. We sat there for a good 10 min before anyone even came to ask us if we would like anything to drink. The only good thing was that the food came out pretty quickly. Which isn't too surprising considering it was just soup. We had the steak pho. Super good and the portion was huge. my BF and I could have literally ordered one to share. We also ordered the chicken fried rice which was really bland and didn't have a flavor at all. The pho was good enough to maybe come back But for the lack of customer service I might try a different pho spot next time."

You leave the place leaving with the smell of Pho on you, but then again, I love pho so that's really not a problem.\n\nThe food was great and came out quickly, which is the best thing after drinking and clubbing at 5am and walking around in the cold. \n\nIf I have to be honest, the main reason why I even wanted to try the place was because of the name. I'd go anywhere where the name is a sexual pun...or if this was just a Vietnamese name and it was done without any bit of irony, then my apologies... Other wise, pho kim long? Yes please!"

The good thing is that the waits are never usually that long; service is quick and efficient. \n\nMy go to items: \n- Kim Long Fried egg rolls; comes with a dipping fish sauce, lettuce to wrap the egg roll in, and pickled veggies to top it off \n- Pho with brisket only; tender and delicious\n\nI've also tried and enjoyed:\n- Rice Vermicelli with charbroiled chicken or pork + egg rolls; rice noodle topped with fresh chopped lettuce, fresh veggies, charbroiled meat and sliced egg rolls, also comes with fish sauce to add in\n- Crispy calamari; salt and pepper, very flavorful, comes with a Mozzarella dipping sauce\n- Mongolian beef; add spice to your liking, very tasty and comes with white or brown rice\n \nPho Kim Long is convenient and a restaurant my friends and I go to at least once a month. Fast service, good prices, and filling dishes!"

That being said, the food/ service was a little haphazard. \n\nI ordered the combination pho and it came out very quickly.  In my mind pho is all about the broth. Broth is a make or break thing and a good pho will have those amazing multiple layers of anise, coriander, fish sauce etc. this broth was missing something. Couldn't put my finger on it, but the broth did not have the flavor explosion I am accustomed to in pho. I wasn't bad per se, but I've had waaaay better pho. Bland. \n\nThe service on the other hand was terrible. I almost walked out of the restaurant because the server helped two other tables that came in after me and still had me sit there for 5 minutes after. He failed to bring out my spring rolls and then hassled me when I asked to have my nonexistent spring rolls removed from the bill. \n\nKudos for them being open 24/7, but there are at least 5 better pho joints with .5 miles. Go there."

It's not that I don't think pho is good food. It's just that I have so many other favorites that rank above it, so sue me hehe. That said, I have tried pho at alot of places but I've been here the most. That partly is due to its proximity to the Strip and being open 24hrs. Who am I kidding, those ARE the main reasons I've patronized this pho establishment more than any other pho spot. Friends visiting out of town, want late night eats nearby after gambling and/or partying all day/night. \nI remember when it wasn't open late. Then it seemed like every year or 2 the closing time became 1hr later, next thing I know it's 24hrs! Pho spots are notorious for their horrible service. Although the last time I went recently the service was horrible. The pho came with a lemon wedge instead of limes and I got exactly one basil thai stem. And we could never find our waiter and ended up having 3 separate waiters help us. Besides that, the service has been pretty decent here. The broth doesn't taste noticeably better or worse than any of the other pho's I've had. I do get a little annoyed everytime I get my pho, the rare steak on top is already fully cooked from the heat of the broth. I should probably follow my one friend's lead and ask for the meat on the side so that doesn't happen but I always forget.\nIf you eat at the hours I do, there probably is not many other options but during normal times when people eat, there are alot of pho choices scattered along Spring Mountain Road in Chinatown. I think it's a decent place for pho and it helps that you never have to worry if it's closed."

I always check Yelp! prior to visiting places but we didn't have much time to read reviews this am so we just decided to give this place a try. \nThe food was actually decent and would probably have gotten a much higher review if the service was not so horrible.\nFirst, I asked for a high chair when we walked in and the server kind of rolled his eyes at me.  Then, prior to ordering, we asked if we can split the check two ways between 6 people and he gave us a face and flatly said \"this is one table, you only get one check!\" Then he said \"talk to the cashier when you pay\". This is supposed to be a sit down restaurant and our server is asking us to talk to the cashier? Huh?! Was this the first time someone's ever asked to split a check in this place? Their menu even said \"may only split check five ways\" or something like that. \nI didn't think we were being unreasonable for splitting the check TWO ways.  So I walked over to the cashier after our meal to ask if we can split the check and he said \"No... talk to your server\", then he came over and handed us our check. Needless to say, we ended up just splitting the check ourselves. It's not really a big deal, but I'm kind of peeved since it was such a simple and routine request as a patron that they couldn't grant. \nAnyway, there are so many other Vietnamese places around  to check out for Pho... not bothering to go back to  this one!"

I can't put into words how the service sucks.\n\nThe first time I was here, my family and I were seated in the back corner. Workers and waiters went back and forth our table but never paid attention. I mean we were obviously in the corner, but seriously.. what the hell? We got our food and all and then my sister felt sick. Instantly, she blacked out and my mom hurried and ordered a lemon soda to help her. It took forever to come and none of the waiters cared. I mean, even customers walking by the go to the restroom saw her unconscious and asked if she was okay. Such workers.. \n\nFood wasn't even great. The pho was watery and the bun bo hue was bland. I did enjoy my Rotisserie Chicken though but it's so not worth my time waiting and not worth my time dealing with the workers. \n\nSecond time I came here, and OH MY GOSH... bad bad bad. My family was separated into two tables. I mean that's fine with us. The other table had 4 adults and were seated and served immediately. Like I mean they got the food before my table ordered fast.. In my table had 3 adults and 4 kids. I guess we looked like teenagers and so this was where the service began sucking. We flagged down at least 4 workers to take our orders. While taking our orders, the man was being so fucking rude. Excuse my language but I'm pretty sure it's because we looked young. Our food took awhile to get to us too.. the other table were done eating and my cousin didn't even get her food yet. It was reallllly bad. They also gave the other table their check too. I'm sure everyone knows what it means when the restaurant gives you your check right? It's the universal language to LEAVE. Uhhh why would they pay and leave if more than half their party was still eating? Like what? Then they got mad because my aunt questioned it. I can't express how rude and uncomfortable we felt. I knew they were annoyed so honestly one more gesture or request would result in them spitting into our food. \n\nIT TOOK FOREVER TO GET OUR CHANGE BACK. I am one to never leave less tip but I can't help but tip them bad. Honestly, this place needs a reality check. I'm really curious why they're so packed all the time.\n\nParking can be a bitch as the parking is shared amongst several other restaurants and stores.\n\nSAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE."

It's nice to get some decent non-expensive food when you're hungry after partying on the strip. \n\nHad their pho with rare steak and it was similar in quality to other pho places.\n\nNice that this place is huge and pretty clean as well."

            "review": "This is one of my most favorite places here in Las Vegas. At any given time, this place is always packed - we even had a 20-min wait one time at close to 11pm!  But we endure the wait, which turned out to be not as long as we anticipated. \nMy favorite is their Rare Steak and Brisket soup. The broth is full of flavor. I've tried a lot of different places around Las Vegas but no one has broth like they serve here. \nI also like ordering their spring rolls. It comes with sides of bean sprouts, mint leaves and lime and you wrap it with lettuce leaves. Yummy! \nOn our latest visit, we ordered the Japanese noodles. We keep forgetting to order it every-time we come here and finally this time we remembered it before we were already full. It was really scrumptious. No wonder why almost every table we saw had ordered this as well. \nThe fish stew was also delightful. The fish was tender and not overcooked. It was saut\u00e9ed with ginger, which gave it a clean flavor. It was so good, I was conflicted whether I wanted to make more room for that or the rare steak pho that I usually order. I ended up eating the former and took the rest of the latter home. \nAs for my 4 star rating, as good as their food is, I take away a star bec of their service. The staff isn't very friendly and most of the time, their service is lousy. Lousy service won't keep me from coming back to this place though - I would just ignore it and look at my bowl of soup and it completely makes up for it."

My was right and my friend's was wrong.  We had to get servers attention where no utemcil, chopsticks, nor soup spoon were offered.  Pleaded for their attention and got slightly flustered telling them we couldn't eat with our hand and his order was wrong.  Took it back and finally his Bun Bo Hue came and it looked strange because there is no lemongrass chili sauce and it is the exactly the same with Pho.   Called the server  and gave us a dirty look saying the sauce were on the side and we got to mix it ourselves (first time ever in Vietnamese rest and my buddy is a owner of Viet rest).  Broth is decent, food was decent, the service was as rude as one can be.  I really should raise the issues with the manager but my friend told me NOT to do so.  No apology was given for all the mistakes.  Typical rude Las Vegas service that this city is famous for."

The appearance on the inside looks very nice. Very comfortable place to sit down and have a nice meal. We got to sit next to one of their two aquarium. We enjoyed the company of the fishes. \n\nNow for the food part. We got their pho, bum bo hue, this beef with rice, and wonton noodle soup. Overall they were good, but not to the point that made us go \"wow\". We had much better Viet/Chinese food, but the service+ environment makes up for it. The best part though was their Thai tea. THE BEST I had so far after trying many places that serves this beverage. \n\nFinally, it was nice that they open 24/7. I read a lot of yelpers liking pho for hangovers. But as a person who isn't big on drinking, it it's still nice to know there is a nice pho restaurant that will serve well any time of the day. Can't go wrong with this place."

My miserable, hungover soul is so grateful.\n\nI rode the struggle bus (Lyft) here on a Saturday night around 10pm after suffering from a dreadful day club hangover. I found my cure in the wonton egg noodle soup and the fresh young coconut. (I know, I know. Who orders wonton soup at a pho restaurant?) But the egg noodle soup was surprisingly pretty good! Coming from San Francisco and one of the largest Chinatowns in the country, I can definitely say that I've had better, but for what it was, it hit the spot. I was craving a lighter soup than beef-based pho broth anyway. \n\nBut the light at the end of the hangover tunnel was the fresh young coconut. SOO GOOD AND SO REFRESHING. Comes served in a coconut, and they give you a spoon so you can scrape off the pulp inside to eat. I felt like a brand new woman afterwards! Okay, not really, my head still hurt, but the coconut/soup really did help.\n\nService was friendly and made sure our water cups were filled. I look forward to curing future hangovers here."

Parking was a pain but we managed to get one (not like there's a lot of space in Chinatown). Walked in and the place was pretty busy, about a 10 minute wait, not so bad.\n\nOnce we were seated the waiter took our order. We got the flank and brisket pho with an order of combination fried rice. Since I had never eaten pho before my boyfriend made my bowl for me. It came with a plate covered with greens to brighten up the dark brothed soup. I did add everything to it and also added a few dashes of chili sauce to have a kick. My goodness, this soup was uh mazing. The broth was hot but not lava and they are not stingy with meat. The bowl is big enough for my boyfriend and I to share and so was the rice. The rice was nice also, had plenty of chicken and shrimp the order is huge. \n\nThe check with both the rice and soup (drinks also) was under $25 how can you go wrong. Left stuffed but satisfied. Been here a few times more because no other pho joint has been this good. The only reason I took off one star is because the service is very slow and sometimes you have to call for someone to seat you or take your order. I understand you're busy but they need to become more organized."

As your seated you will have a server rush up to you within a few short minutes trying to rush you for an order and if your not ready they won't came back for it for the longest time. Once ordered if you did order any soups such as pho than they will have it out within a few minutes because it's the easiest to serve. So half the table will have their food and the other half won't for a good wait. After the food is dropped off you will not get any attention at all from the servers for refills or anything at all. Expect to constantly ask for whatever you need. The pho is a hit or miss, there's days that it's okay other days it's just flat out too oily. Very busy place , but way over hyped!

The thai tea was probably biggest disappointment for me since it nearly half ice as I drank the whole thing so quickly and saw there so much ice, so I'd recommend asking for little or no ice if you get thai tea. Pho was $9 for large bowl which seemed more like a regular bowl at other places and pad thai was $12. Definitely come here for the late hours, but I suggest elsewhere for better Vietnamese food."

As I lay here feeling full of regret and in disbelief of how disgusting our dinner was here, my stomach is extra tender and sore and my mouth is numb and dehydrated. \n\nI'm full Vietnamese and this place is such a huge embarrassment and a disgrace to real authentic Vietnamese food. \n\nFirst offense - the goi cuon (shrimp and pork spring rolls/ summer rolls) were tiny and barely had any filling inside. A piece of lettuce, a tiny bit of noodles, a sliver of meat and 3 slivers of shrimp. Oh, and that so called dipping sauce was so gross! Super watered down. What a ripoff. \n\nSecond offense - Msg was never really an issue for me and it never really caused me any problems, until I ate here. Also, my uncle is really sensitive to it and he had a lot of issues with his pho. He didn't drink any of his pho broth because it had too much MSG and by the end of dinner he started to feel sick. \n\nThird offense - the nuoc cham (fish sauce/dipping sauce) was so watered down, that I ended up asking them for 3 bowls for my meal - but even 3 bowls was not enough and I finally gave up. It was disgustingly bland. I was pretty much pouring sugar water onto my rice. \n\nFourth offense - my pork chop was dry and the marinade was bland. The charring on the pork chop tasted artificial. \n\nFifth offense - our tongue is all sorts of numb and shriveled up after eating here. I guess MSG does that to you. We're extremely weak, thirsty and dehydrated now. \n\nSixth offense - the chow fun beef noodles in gravy (hu tieu xao bo) was so unappetizing and unappealing, I was in disbelief they served it to us. They overcooked the chow fun noodles so they broke up into a billion of small pieces when you tried to pick them up with chopsticks, the gravy was all watery and goopy.

They didn't understand a word I said and gave me the wrong type of pho. And the thing that pissed me off the most is that the cashier expects you to know how much your meal was. If you go up and tell them you don't know, they stand there and tell you to calculate it. And in the customer point of view, THAT IS THE EMPLOYEE'S JOB. Then they just throw out a random number if you don't know what it is. \n\nSecond, the soup to noodle ratio is inefficient. They provide more soup and less noodles. I'd rather pay for more noodles, I mean that's what pho is right, A NOODLE SOUP. I want to get my money's worth. Also, they aren't careful with how they handle their bowls. Since their is too much soup, it spills over the edge. And they don't even clean it up for you. I also tried my cousin's boba, and it was garbage.\n\nOverall. This was enough to influence my decision that I'm never going here again. The employees need to learn how to do their jobs and learn to have better customer service skills. I do not recommend Pho Kim Long for pho lovers."

Although they were a bit stingy with the pork, there was enough tofu to take back for a second meal.\n\nI thought the service was fine, the restaurant attractive; all in all a good place to eat."

I'm no expert at being a food critic, but I honestly can't find a complaint for this place. The most amazing thing that really gets me is that the meat they put in the broth isn't even fully cooked when it's served. It cooks while the broth is still steamin' hot. \n\nPersonally, I can find myself going here over and over again. There's nothing wrong with this place at all. Except for the parking. It's a total drag during the busy hours, which is usually night time-ish. However, Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours, which is just amazing."

Since I work more normal hours, I rarely meet him -- but when I can, it's always a treat...\n\nLast night, since I had the day off today, we went -- and it was yummy!  \n\nBen was there and in addition to my usual can't miss dish (the salt and pepper calamari -- with jalapeno, green onions and crispy garlic), he suggested the Vietnamese salad with chicken -- it was brilliant!  Crispy cabbage, crunchy crushed peanuts, fried shallot rings, crispy garlic , tender pulled chicken, cilantro and a miso/ginger dressing that was perfect -- I love salads that are balanced in flavor, texture and acidity... he said they make it with duck, beef, shrimp, calamari, just about every protein they have in house...  \n\nThen he suggested we try the lamb -- I know...lamb at Pho?  It was phenomenal -- tender lamb chops with Chinese spices, grilled to medium rare...over a cold, crispy romaine salad -- again another great dressing -- not sure about ingredients in this one though...\n\nThen he told us they had venison...but by the time he got back with sauces it was 86d, so he ordered the beef for us.  Out came a large, smoking hot black river rock -- a plate of sliced beef, with chunks of butter and limes.   He melted the butter on the stone, then put the beef on it and we cooked it to our degree of doneness -- squeeze of lime -- a dip in the sauce, and it was tender and delicious and took seconds.   That rock wasn't going to cool down anytime soon...\n\nLast night, the spring rolls weren't that great, and the dumplings were tough -- so I'll avoid them next time.  Hey, I can't eat everything...so it's fine with me -- but I'm still looking for Vegas' best potstickers... \n\nBut for a chef to come, and when he's in the mood, for the experience to be totally different -- that many think is just same ol, same ol --  and for us to be treated like royalty (uh, we're not Asian...), is a real treat.  \n\nI've been in a few times by myself for a quick lunch -- and they always remember me.

My friends and I had breakfast here,and ordered the pho dac bi\u00e8t and b\u00fan t\u00ect n\u00fa\u00f3ng. One friend wanted the pho ga as well as the pho dac bi\u00e8t, so she ended up asking if she could have the pho dac bi\u00e8t with the t\u00ect ga in it and they were more than obliged to do so! My other friend ordered the bun t\u00ect n\u00fa\u00f3ng but they gave her chicken instead of the beef. My friend not being so picky ended up eating the dish, which turned out to be pretty good.  The table adjacent to us ended up getting her dish instead. The waiters knew they made a mistake as did we and surprisingly acknowledged their mistake, which is always great and rare for any pho restaurant to do. Good thing we're not picky eaters, plus we were on a time crunch so we were more interested in eating and going.  Our food came with a good amount of meat so it turned out to be very filling.  I do believe the dishes are priced a little high but since I did not see too many other pho restaurants I guess competition is scarce.  All in all a good place for Vietnamese food, almost like home cooking.  I enjoy eating off the Vegas strip."

I am definitely a pho lover by far the best pho I've had. Nice and hot when it's served but not to hot which is prefect for me atleast. I always order the taro boba always taste exactly how I remember it an the smoothie is never to watery or too thick. \n\nOverall I am a pretty satisfied customer, My only issue is the restrooms otherwise I do recommend this restaurant."

It's different; hard to explain.\n\nI like to come here for the fried chicken appetizer, the spring rolls, fried egg rolls, and of course the Vermicelli bowls; you can never go wrong with Vermecelli because you pour the fish sauce in for taste!  I like the significant amount of vegetables they put in their vermecelli bowls - I like to think it's healthy!  \n\nI have a few friends that frequent this place and love it, but they never had Pho from my hometown, so they're missing out.\n\nLooking for a quick, decent Asian meal?

I've been here a bunch of times already and I'll admit it's my favorite place to go FOR THE FOOD only. Rarely ever do I get greeted upon arrival or when I leave. This place is always packed considering the fact that it is open 24/7, and the wait time for a table always varies between 20-30 min during peak hours. Trust me, if you visit this place during peak hours, good luck finding a seat to wait or a place to stand cause there's not much space to do so. The servers don't really seem like they care about their customers, they're just there to pretty much \"serve\" you your food. They all look like they hate their jobs and don't wanna be there, and at times it's so busy that they're all just running around and rushing to get a table vacant asap for the next party. \n\nUnfortunately, I come here so often that I started not caring about the customer service I receive either bc the food makes up for it. My boyfriend and I always get their pho, spring rolls, and calamari, which we loooooove! Their chicken pad Thai is also bomb. The price is pretty reasonable for the portions they give. I really wish they improve on their customer service soon, business seems to be booming here so it's no excuse to lack good customer service."

I had pan fried noodles and I received a plate that was drenched in sauce.

Teriyaki Madness makes just as good of a chicken teriyaki as Pho Kim Long.\n\nI notice this place is voted best in Vegas, however it must be voted by non asian people as this restaurant is full of non asians and even the asians that review this place don't give it a good review."

They only started offering this shellfish in June, weekends only.\n\nMy luck that the Sunday I choose to come in, they weren't offering it. We still sat down for dinner and this is what we got: \n\n* Hu Tieu Hoac Mi Bo Kho (Beef Stew Egg Noodle) - $7.95: The Big F enjoyed his noodle soup.  I was too busy with my plate to eat much of his.\n\n* Dau Dua Xao XO Sauce (Stir fried String Beans with XO Sauce) - $9.95: Tasty string beans, a bit on the pricey side though.  A nice spice kick as well.\n\n* Com Ga Hai Nam (Hai Nam Style Chicken with Seasoned Rice) $8.50: I've always liked Hainamese chicken since my friend's mom made it for me, along with the seasoned rice.  It's good here, but definitely not as good as my friend's mom's version.\n\nPho Kim Long II is a huge restaurant with lots of big tables for large parties.  A great place for families to eat and friends to gather after a late night.  Their menu is pretty extensive so there's plenty of choices for everyone.  And portions seem pretty decent-sized too.  (I wish they would get a bigger fish tank though because there are way too many fish in that tiny thing up front!)\n\nFrom this experience, I give it a FOUR stars.\n\nI love Hot N Juicy Crawfish up the road, and I definitely believe in some healthy competition.  So, last Friday we decided to finally check out their crawfish and see if it's worthy.\n\nWe decided to start off with two pounds and see where we went for there.     We noticed a neighboring table with their order of crawfish and was definitely excited.  It came in a large bowl with red potatoes, corn on the cob and sausage.  They also brought extra bowls for the shells and a plate for us to eat on.  The Big F requested limes, salt and pepper to make a dipping concoction.\n\nI dove right in and noticed the big difference...the crawfish was not fresh.  It was old or way overcooked.  The tail meat didn't come off the shell easily and was broken up.  I thought it was just the first one and continued eating.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  There was little to no head juice either, which was very disappointing to me.  The Big F was easily disgusted with the crawfish and we were glad that we only ordered two pounds to start.  (We usually go for two pounds each!)  The corn, potatoes, and sausage were good though, but it didn't make up for the bad crawfish.  Since it comes in a bowl, there's no sauce on the bottom for you to dip your crawfish in after you shell it.  No bibs were provided, which explains all the stains on my shirt.\n\nWhen I'm craving crawfish, I'll drive up the road and spring the extra cash over at Hot N Juicy.\n\nFor this experience, I give it a TWO stars.\n\nOverall, a four stars for their Vietnamese food, and a two stars for their bad crawfish.  I'm giving Pho Kim Long II a THREE star.\n\n(Pics are posted!)"

This restaurant is located in Chinatown just a short drive from the strip. Pho is certainly a healthy choice and a great way to keep hydrated out in the desert here. It  will also help warm you up on a cold day. If you have never eaten Pho get the traditional Rare Steak Pho (it starts out rare but is cooked via the hot broth) or get my personal favorite Rare Steak & Brisket Pho.

The pho portion was tiny. The broth had absolutely no flavors or aroma, it was pretty much MSG loaded. The service was non existant because the server never came by once and ask if we need anything. None of our pho had side vegetables. My bowl had no onions/clitrantro when I didnt specify for them to do so. Worst part was when we checked out to pay, they circle gratutity suggesting we give that amount. Anyhow, this place is just not good. First time here and will never be back."

I love and am very critical about the taste of pho that I eat, but I can honestly say that this place has some pretty good pho, even compared to the many places I've been to in the past. Not only that, but they also give you a decent sized portion for a large. \n\nI was with two Viet friends who often get homemade pho from their parents, and they both said that the pho was good. That should DEFINITELY count for something.\n\nThe moral of this review? I'm going to continue going to this restaurant every Vegas trip, and you should too."

There were no other local Vietnamese restaurants nearby while visiting with friends for three days so I dined here twice. \n\nFirst off, their Pho Dac Biet was bland with no flavour. It seems as if they underestimated their peak hour business and so they must have ran out of broth and created some lame pho base. I can tell because it was diluted and also growing up eating so much Pho, one can tell what the broth consists of. \n\nSecond day of dining, their dumpling broth was sour, meaning that this probably went bad. I turned it back and headed on over to Lee's sandwich for some edible food. Of course they credited the overall bill from a party of 12.\n\nThe only dish that looked appetising was their thit nuong cam tam. It looked very delicious from what my friend told me and also it tasted on par to normal thit nuong dishes here.\n\nWould I come back? Probably not since Vegas is a hit or miss in terms of food."

They're 24 hours and one of the few affordable restaurants close to the strip. But seriously though, food is supposed to taste better when your drunk, isn't it?\n\nPHO: Sometimes my soup comes a little greasy. On occasion, noodles are under-cooked and I feel like their beef and other fillings could use some improvement. Also, pho is served with \"rare steak.\" So why is my beef tai 100% cooked when it gets to the table?\n\nCHINESE: I came here a lot with someone who didn't like Vietnamese food. He ordered off the Chinese menu because lets face it, who doesn't like Chinese food? The seafood combination pan-fried noodles and the beef stir fry with broccoli are pretty good. Entrees are usually served with steamed rice. The fried rice here is flavorless and not worth the $8. If you like Mapo Tofu, skip the mapo tofu here, it tastes strange!\n\nAPPETIZERS: Spring rolls are pretty good. But they're raw and  you drench them in peanut sauce--can't mess those up. Egg Rolls taste good but they're unusually small... For the same price, I can get decent size ones down the street at my favorite pho joint. \n\nCREDIT CARD FRAUD: A day or two after one visit, I realized I never got my card back from the server. When numerous fraudulent charges came up, I had to assume a shady server swiped my card. They ordered things online and sent them to a local address. PAY CASH. Can't trust shady asians.\n\nSERVICE: The service sucks. It's god awful and when you really need water, don't expect them to give it to you on their own. Don't be shy, flag someone down and demand what you need.\n\nNothing to rave about but not a bad place to eat when your wasted and in desperate need of food.\n\nDon't forget to RATE & FOLLOW! ;)"

I enjoyed my Pho, it was what I expected it to be, my wife said she did not like the egg in her meal because it was not cooked in the way that she is used to.  The inside of Pho Kim Long was decorated nicely, with vibrant colors and flowers, and also the quintessential fish tank.  I would recommend Pho Kim Long for the late night eater in Vegas."

I enjoy it fairly regularly and have no hesitation driving from Green Valley to Chinatown to get my late night pho fix."

At first I wasn't very impressed, but after trying a few different things I have kind of come around.\n\nFirst of let me say that I work overnights, so when I get off at 5am my options are extremely limited. Pho Kim Long is probably the healthiest option if i want to eat out. The place is always clean but the service is lacking. Usually one person takes your order, another brings you the drink (a lot of the time after receiving food), another brings you the food.\n\nThe food always comes out in random order. Sometimes the Pho comes out first, sometimes the entrees. Sometimes it takes forever and sometimes its quick.\n\nBecause I've been there at least 20 times I've tried a lot on the menu, but not everything (the menu is extensive). \n\nThe combination pho is good, it's not the best I've had but its consistently good. no complaints.\n\nThe spring rolls are fresh, but they are small. A lot smaller than any other place I've been.\n\nSome of the entrees I've had we're just mediocre including Kung pao chicken, mongolian beef, curry chicken, and walnut shrimp. They weren't bad, just nothing stood out.\n\nOne dish that did stand out was the Honey garlic pork chops. I don't know if these are Vietnamese or Chinese or what, but they are some of the best food I've had at an asian restaurant. So tasty!\n\nAll in all, with the exception of slow service I don't have any major complaints for Pho Kim Long. I'll continue to go there, just usually late night because during the day I feel like there are better options."

My guess is they took out whatever business was next door.\n\nSince this place IS open 24/7, it's the perfect spot when you are craving Pho after a big night out.\n\nFunny side note....at 3:30am, the guy that seats you, is a cop.

Most Vietnamese restaurants serve Tomato Flavored rice with their beef, this place just had plain ol steamed rice which was a bit bland and dry for me. \n\nAlso i had one of their lemonade drinks, it was warm and only had a few pieces of ice in it.

We waited, because Asians cannot go a week without some Pho or rice. When we got to our table, it was a little sticky (well, almost ALL pho restaurants have those) but we didn't care. \n\nThe pho was a little pricy, but they came out fabulous! Totally worth your money. It's not like Pho Kim Long is the Gucci of pho places, but definitely it's great. Pour some of dat Sriracha and hoisin sauce into your big bowl of pho, add some bean sprouts and jalape\u00f1o, and squeeze in some of dat lime. Delishussss. \n\nOkay, maybe the service was a little slow, but this is the only good and authentic pho place in town. And how to know the pho is authentic? The broth must have this layer of fat on top, but it's no big deal. I mean, if you have never tried pho before, shame on you. As I said before, delishussss.\n\nAnd parking...meh. Service...meh.

And by the way, the restaurant was half empty so it wasn't busy. \n\n2. We ordered pho and bun bo hue. This is the saddest part. Just a giant bowl of soup. Each of our bowl had 4 slices of meat, that was so small it was probably shredded from one piece of meat. \n\n3. That wasn't the worst part with our food, that the meat was almost non-existent. Worst part was when we couldn't find the noodles in the giant bowl of soup. We almost called them over that they forgot to put noodles in there before my wife said she found it, the barely 3-4 fully chopstick grip full of noodles. With so little noodles swimming in a giant bowl of soup, it was quite annoying because you only get a few strands with each grab. So annoying.\n\nThere are many other great pho restaurants around the area now a days. For cheaper. Skip pho Kim long. This place went to shit."

We stood there waiting at the cash register as he completely ignored us while he was playing around with some receipts. When he finally looks up he rudely tells us he cannot split the check. When I asked why, he said because it was Sunday, enunciating every word he spoke as though I was an idiot. I said ok. SO we scanned the check to see what each one of us owed as he huffed and puffed. Then he grabbed the check and literally guesstimated what each one of us owed. I'm sure he overcharged more than $20 but no problem since we're NEVER returning to this joint."

You get to add the spice to it yourself, so the broth is to your liking.  Each bite had meat, tendon and they also included the pig knuckle (which I like in my Bun Bo Hue.)  I would order it again.  The noodles were thick and cooked right.  It was a good bowl of Spicy noodles, but for $9, it better be good.\n\nThe total bill was $15, a bit overpriced for an underwhelming experience.

The HORRIBLE part was on the way out. My husband was carrying my son out first (while the rest of the party was gathering their belongings) when a waiter said to him in a very rude way, \"Move out of the way\". Come on now, you can at least say excuse me. That was the final straw for my husband, he told the waiter that he was extremely rude, and he would like to speak to the owner of the establishment. Turns out he was the son of the owner and the owner was not there. We asked for his dad's number so we can call him but he of course wouldn't give it to us. We probably would have been okay if he had just apologized and said he was in a rush or something but he didn't seem to care. I guess if the son of the owner doesn't care about how he treats the customers, there's no reason for the other workers to care either! Needless to say, we won't be going back."

I've been to a good amount of pho restaurants here in Las Vegas and if you have too then you know that pho & drinks are served to you pretty fast.\n\nNow before I go on to my little rant, I must add that their pho is never a disappointment. What I always get is number 13 which is the combination pho which has a little bit of most things & the steak is flavorful. So good job Pho Kim Long for yummy pho ! But BOO for the lack of service you offer ! \n\nMy boyfriend and I went and we ordered two #13 combination phos and I also ordered a tai tea boba. About 3 minutes later our pho is served to us but not my drink. You would of thought my drink came first, right? Well, I thought, \"Oh, maybe they're still making it\" so about another good 5 minutes passes by & my boba is still not served to me & I started to question my thoughts about this place. So we asked one of the waiters where my boba was and he just walked off without any acknowledgement or reassurance that it was coming. So we waited another 10 minutes and my boyfriend and I are just about done with our pho and still....no....tai tea boba. I asked another waiter, \"Hi excuse me, I've been waiting for about 10 minutes for my tai tea boba now and I still haven't gotten it.\" & he got the job done but he didn't even apologize for the long wait. \n\nI got my boba just in time we paid for the check and the boba was great but ugh the service is whack. I need I add that we did go there during graveyard hours but still, you can't lack on a job especially if it runs 24/7 and stays busy."

Frankly, it looked more like a Chinese restaurant rather than a Vietnamese joint inside. And the menu reflected this to a certain extent, where the offering was well beyond what you'd find at a pho place, with dishes that readily reminds you of a Chinese joint in the 626. The waiter / server was helpful, pointing us in the right direction. The pho broth was hot and tasty. Saw a lot of other people eating what looked like stir fried dishes. Definitely going to have to delve into that side of the menu the next time I'm in Vegas. Highly recommended."

This place was recommended by a fellow parent that was there for the same tournament as us, so a bunch of us went. \nThat was actually my first time ordering a bowl of Pho for myself. I usually just order rice and some other meat. My husband is the Ph\u00f4 lover and eats it on a weekly basis. \nMy bowl of Pho was really good and for that bowl alone, I'd give 5 stars. My husband of course enjoyed his and so did everyone else in our group. \nThe low stars are because the service was just terrible. To be fair, we were a large group, however, we did split up into 3 separate groups to make it easier on the staff. Or so we thought. \nFood came out sporadically and we were ignored by the staff. One guy dropped off two bowls and walked away, and when we were trying to tell him it wasn't ours, he ignored us and continued to walk away. We had to stop another waiter and let him know it was someone else's food. \nAs our food was coming out (sporadically) the same rude guy would stand so close to me that he almost hit the side of my head with a plate. And later, as we were eating, he reaches right between my husband and me to fill up the spoons that are in the middle of the table! Could he not wait? Or could he not ask us to hand the thing over? And as he was passing through behind our table, I heard him say \"behind you, move out of the way\" to a customer! He was horrible and seemed miserable to be there. \nWould I go back? Probably not, there are many good Pho places out there. But I did enjoy my Pho."

Some people prefer lots of bean sprouts & chili paste or sriracha in it. It's all about preference. The last time I ate it, I was a little bummed that I ran out of noodles.\n\nA good thing to take note of, is that you can order pho in a small or large size.

With my most recent trip to Vegas being a bit longer of a stay.... finally, I had enough time to make it out to this 24/7 pho joint. I'm glad I did!! \nFirst off, the Crab Rangoon was so good that I ordered a second order... (don't worry, I was sharing haha). So definitely try that!  \nFor my main dish, I ordered the beef and flank pho... sooooo delicious! I think I'm getting the hang of how to eat pho! I'm still quite the novice pho eater, so I don't have a bunch to compare to... but the pho I had in Hawaii was on par with this establishment. \nTo be honest, this place was a lot bigger than I imagined and a lot nicer, too. For a place thats open 24hrs a day, I figured it'd be a little hole in the wall... but there is ample seating and the ambience is surprisingly a slight step above casual. (Though you can stroll in here casual, dont worry)."

Anyway, I've been going here since I hit 21 with my friends. The prices are so reasonable and their food is absolutely amazing and hits the point everytime. One of my friend who was craving for it this past weekend when we were in Vegas, woke up from her nap and seriously drove there just to pick up the togo order, with a two hour time frame to get ready before going to Marquee. That is how good it is! Haha and she's not even Asian! Pho does the body good. I always get Pho Tai Chin, which is well done steak and rare steak. Their Roasted Chicken plate with seasonal rice is bombdotcom! \n\nI'm Vietnamese and I know how pho should taste like. Go here if you crave for some pho while your visit in Vegas!

This place is always packed with drunken guests or tourists looking for a quick lunch after their Vegas trip (which defines the exact two moments I came here, after the club and on the way home) it's off the strip in Vegas' little china town and the pho is pretty on point. \n\nThe broth is good, I don't like super sweet pho broth, and it had a nice savory taste. They didn't give a lot of noodles, but it didn't really matter to me, I go for the soup. Warm soup after cold nights  and drunken clubbing? It hits the spot. I always get my beef on the side so that I can cook it myself in the soup, if you love pho tai, you should definitely try it this way! The meat stays nice and tender instead of getting overcooked. I tried it one day on the side and one day the normal way and surprisingly it wasn't super dry like most places, the meat was still pretty soft! \n\nIf you have a large party, chances are you will get split up, the most they usually seat is a party of 7-8. And prepare for a wait because this place is crackin'."

I mean, the fact alone that this place is called what it is (hahaha), plus being chock full of young Asian patrons at 2am (we'd just cruised over from midnight Christmas mass, lol), they have to be doing something right.\n\nPrice was perfect.

The place was busy, but no so busy at that time that people should have been waiting very long. I could see open tables from where we were standing. The guy said a 10 minute wait, it was at least 20.\n\nWe were brought water and weren't asked if we wanted anything else to drink. They barely gave us time to look before we were being asked if we had decided. My friend is a vegetarian so he needed a moment more and said so. Not even seconds after telling the first waiter, a second one comes over and wants to know if we were ready...i said yes and ordered while my friend asked if they had a vegetarian option available. This is where the service got bad, because the guy got nasty and was like \"Number 21! That what I was just telling you, 21 only vegetarian option for soup\". My friend wasn't asking about soup, he was just asking if they had other options since the menu is ridiculously large and the vegetarian options were all over the place. There was no need for him to get snotty. \n\nSoup wise, it came fast, and the vegetarian soup was good. Mine was honestly lacking in flavor and I needed to add a lot of hoisen and siracha, which I usually do anyway but compared to Saigon 8 where I usually get my pho, it was still kind of lacking in flavor. I could also tell they ignored my request for completely cooked beef since they didnt have an option for one that wasnt paired with raw. My stomach is really sensitive so thankfully I didnt get sick.\n\nOver all, the place is ok if you dont mind shit service, a long wait, and semi decent food late at night, but I will stick with Saigon as their service is at least nice and the soup has flavor.

The price listed is for SMALL, but they don't tell you that. It's $7.25 for SMALL. You can't get steak with beef balls.  You have to get one or the other. But if you want both, it's an extra $1.00.

The ice cream could have been served a little but it was still great.\n\nTo top it all off our server was one of the most friendly servers I've had. I believe he said it was only his second day working there. He did an outstanding job and was very personable. The whole family left very satisfied!"

We didn't even ask for rice and they brought it out for no reason and refused to refund us the money until we argued with them.\n\nI would never come back and I would not recommend this place to anyone.

It may be that I just don't care much for pho in general, so I'm hard to please when it comes to the subject. \n\nBased on the outrageous line that exists nearly every time I've been there, be it 8pm or 4am, this is a definitely a hot spot in town. Fortunately, there were only two of us so we were sat quickly. The hostess seemed annoyed at the amount of ppl waiting for tables and was just wanting to get everyone out of the waiting area, so she barely made eye contact, and a smile was entirely out of the question. \n\nThe server possessed the same quality of indifference toward us. I realize this place is probably quantity-driven versus quality-driven, so I tried not to let the poor service bother me too much. He only came by when it was time to order, and we had to flag him down for a refill on soda. Honestly, the \"water-refill guy\" was more attentive than our server. \n\nThe food was mediocre, but again, that could be because I don't have much of an affinity for pho. The broth was pretty bland, so I found myself continuously adding to it throughout the meal. Even though I ordered my pho with rare steak, I only had about 3 pieces of meat in my entire bowl. Incredibly disappointing. I will say the shrimp and pork spring rolls we had as an appetizer were delicious, however. Better than the soup, in my opinion. \n\nIt took awhile for us to get our credit card slips back after giving them to the server to pay. A tad annoying since we were in a hurry. \n\nOverall, I don't plan on returning here anytime soon, BUT if you are a pho lover who doesn't mind bad service and are just there for the food, this might be the place for you! Again, I know it's one of the most popular places in the city, and there must be a reason for that, right?"

I've experienced pho at many other restuarants and can say Pho Kim Long is just about average.  \n\nMy most recent visit was yesterday. As it was hot, i didn't feel like ordering something too hot like a soup or rather pho. I wasn't too hungry either, so i ordered Pan friend udon, yes I know, a Pho place wouldn't specialize in it, but another place i've been to had superb udon.\n\nIt was around 3pm when i arrived and there was a good amount of people. Glad to see they're still getting service. I walked in and it took me 10 minutes just to get seated. Like i said there was a good amount of people, it wasn't packed or very busy. Once i got a table i browsed the menu, already knowing what i wanted, udon. I eye'd the waiter down or rather signaled him to come over and he looked away, but he did eventually come around after 15 minutes of waiting. I ordered my chicken pan fried udon and he went on his merry way. \n\nThe order came faster than i expected took about 3 to 5 minutes aha. Not bad. I tasted my first mouthfull. Not bad, but not good either. It was very tasteless. I put some sauce on there, it made it better but i could still taste that blandness in the noodles. Nearing the end of the dish, I noticed a lot of bean sprouts leftover. I like beansprouts and i tend to eat those first but there was still a lot and it watered down the sauce so much that it just tasted like water after eating most of the udon.\n\nAgain, I suppose having udon at a pho place isn't ideal, but i wasn't feeling up to having a hot soup on a hot noon day. Perhaps at dinner? \n\nThis was an average day, i was full after eating, but wasn't satisfied with how it tasted. Eat anything but the udon!"

I ordered tai on the side, they gave me tai with an extra order of tai on the side. It's okay, though! It was really THE hangover cure. The broth wasn't too shabby, a bit too much sodium for my taste, but I don't inhale the broth so it was okay.\n\nThe smoothies are packed with powders, but still delicious. I'd get the avocado one over the mango one, though. The avocado powder is at least masked by the creaminess of the milk and had a better aftertaste. \n\nThe decor is extremely modern! I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure why I was expecting something more rundown with 70s decor, haha. Maybe I'm just used to frequenting those types of joints.

I usually get the combination, of tripe, tendon, and the rare beef . Lastly, the quality of, what I call the extras, i.e. Thai basil, white onions, bean sprouts, jalapenos, &etc. \n\nThe second dish I usually judge a Pho joint is by the quality of the spring rolls. Now, I've been to many places where the spring roll just plain sucked! It's hard to find a place that has all the elements of a good spring roll. i.e. the shrimp, not too over cooked. The pork, is it flavorful? Is the vegetables mushy? and the overall quality of the flavor, not too much vinegar, a slight touch of mirin, and of course the quality of the peanut sauce. Makes me hungry as I write this! This place hit all the mark! \n\nNow, let me say this, when a place is called Pho Kim Long...Pho soup is the way to go! Enjoy what they are known for! With that being said, the bowls of delectable Pho has to be one of the better ones in Vegas. It's not to say that the Banh Mi sandwiches are not bad, to be exact, it's actually pretty good! \n\nService is very prompted, friendly, and professional!

Same for the eggrolls and the clear roll.\n\nGood decor, clean restaurant and the service was good."

Vermicelli noodles, rice dishes (not com tam/broken rice though), ph, soup, etc. \nI've been here twice because my dad only enjoys viet food.\nMy first visit I tried their mi xoa Kim long (crispy egg noodle house stir-fry) . It wasn't that good. Too sweet and not enough savory. Oily and most of the noodles where already soggy by the time it got to me. And a small variety of vegetables too.\nThis morning I tried com bo luc lac(shaking beef and rice). It completely lacked flavor and the rice tasted dirty. It's presentation did not look like it was worth $12.50 either. Plus I ordered an egg which came out fully cooked(I wanted sunny side up), broken (I'm a perfectionist), in a pool of oil(plain nasty), and 7 minutes after my rice plate came out(wtf?).\nMy parents order one of Kim Long's more popular dishes. Canh chua (sour soup) and ca kho do(braised fish clay pot). \nThe soup was sour as expected, the fish tasted fresh and clean so this was good\nThe fish clay pot as overly seasoned with oyster sauce so I wasn't a fan.\n\nService was mediocre.

Pretty much every dish is under $10.\n\nAs far as the quality goes, its pretty good! i'm from San Jose so I'm pretty familiar with Vietnamese food, and Pho Kim Long can hold it's own. No complaints with the pho, rice plates, or vercimelli bowls!\n\nOnly downfall is that it gets super busy around 3am.

The server would come to our table when we just sat down and wait until we decide. \n\nThe pho does not have a clear sweet broth with a full load of complex spiced flavor. There was a cloudiness to the soup. The bo vien (meatball) has a consistency of an Italian meatball but it has no flavor at  all. Usually the bo vien has a bounciness when I bite into it. The brisket and rare flank tasted fine. \n\nThe vermicelli w/ grilled pork and egg roll was not the best I've tasted. However if I was craving for this after all the buffet I went to, this will do. \n      --The grilled pork is lean and nicely charred, but not too mind-blowing of a flavor. \n       It's missing the sweet crusted part of the pork.

Came here late night after a mingling event that didn't have enough food. So we decided to pig out here.  \n\nSince we came here so late, we opted for dishes that weren't so carb heavy, which meant more of the Chinese dishes (ie no pho, rice, or vermicelli). We ordered the chicken lettuce wrap appetizer, crispy sweet pork ribs, and ong choy with bean curd sauce. I have to admit I was a bit hesitant because with \"pho\" in the title, I'd assume you'd have to get a bowl of noodles or at least something Vietnamese to get the best food. And all 3 dishes we ordered were Chinese. Yet they were all surprisingly good. \n\nThe chicken lettuce wrap - the chicken saute was very well seasoned. It wasn't served the authentic way with little bowls of sauces and green onion. But it was still very tasty. Only con is that the portion is much smaller than what you'd usually get at a Chinese restaurant.\n\nThe pork dish - I was most surprised with this one. This is a classic Cantonese dish, and it's so easy to mess up by using bad meat. But here the meat tasted fresh and was thinly cut (that's a good thing) with very little fat. The flavors were amazing. Sweet sauce. Crispy pork. I loved it.\n\nThe vegetable dish - Ong choy is also known as Chinese spinach or Chinese watercress. It was prepared the Cantonese way, ie with a bean curd sauce. Nothing out of the world - tasted like what I would expect ong choy to taste like. \n\nThe wait staff are very nice. The food came out suspiciously fast. It was crazy how quickly it came out as soon as we ordered. And yet the dishes were delicious. The venue is busy and happening at all times of the day it seems, and there's ample seating. Every time I've passed by here, the restaurant has always had people in it. My only con is that the dishes are somewhat expensive. You can easily get all 3 dishes we ordered here in SoCal for roughly $20-30, but here it was $40. The food is good though, and they're open late. I'd come here again. But most likely not for another pho kim long time. Okay, I know I probably killed it the first time. :P"

My table only had a total of 3 orders (I shared with another and one of us wasn't hungry, but just wanted to hang out). Anyways, in the end they combined our orders (even though we were at separate tables and weren't able to talk to each other). As a result, the imposed gratuity was much more expensive. I walked up and complained that they should split up the order into two separate transactions. They gave me attitude since I was adamant about it. WHEN MY TABLE GOT OUR RECEIPT OF JUST 3 ORDERS, THEY STILL CHARGED US GRATUITY!!!! I was at my breaking point but my friends persuaded me to let them go. \n\nOther nuisances:\n- Some people at the table ate there before. They have always had pickled onions. This time when we asked for them, the waiters claimed that the restaurant never had them. Liars.\n- My cousin asked if they had different sizes and they said, \"No.\" Later on, he found out that his friend was able to order a small. Liars.\n\nI reside in Little Saigon, California. All I can say is that the food is mediocre for the price offered (around $6-8). Here, a delicious bowl of pho could sell for $4 for a large.\n\nAs a result, for mediocre food that's a little bit too pricey compared to other pho places, the disgraceful service just tops it all for being BLACKLISTED on my list of \"Restaurants That Aren't Worth It.\""

The broth was lacking in flavor cmon it's all about the broth. The meat quality were poor especially the meatballs wtf you could taste the dryness after every chew it was like chewing on a gum that had the flavor sucked all out of it already. \n\nI looked over the menu and it was all over the place. They serve many varieties of dishes from noodle soup, rice dishes, duck, fishes to family meal that offer several courses. Seems like the large variety of food options that are offered is causing less attention to what's really important QUALITY! \n\nI will not be returning! Quality over everything!"

To me, it's not the best broth but it'll do.\n\nThe flavor has been okay every time I come back and with appetizers being ordered that taste kind of bland, it doesn't allow me to give more stars.\n\nThe broth is what makes the soup. The noodles are basically the same at every pho spot. The added protein, white onions, green onions, thai basil, lime and sprouts are all additions to the pho. The broth flavor has to define itself and that's how I decide which place is better than another and it's just okay over here. Actually better when you're super faded - lol!\n\nI love the customer service here as they are super fast, very attentive and want to make you happy so you come back.\n\nAnyways...

After a 30-4 min wait we were seated and ordered the regular pho. Within a few minutes our order comes out. I think they have everything premade because of the amount of people coming to eat.\nThe food was on the salty side. I like a little bit of salty flavor but this was over the top. Not sure if its salt or msg. \nI would rate the food maybe 3-4 stars even with it being salty. But it drops to a 2 because of the service and environment. The servers dont even look at you and are so hurried because they have so many people. Either hire more servers or get management to organize the system better because I had about 3 different people come to me. \n\nOverall this restaurant is like an awesome movie poster to a terrible movie"

I have been here numerous times but don't really appreciate the standard customer service given at this place. This place I normally don't refer to friends but I decided to give this place one more shot due to my close friends wanting to eat this last night. Last night was the final draw for this place never have I ever felt violated, disrespected, and degraded in my life. We go here about 2:30 am after a night of long work and studying. It took the waiter 40 mins to take our order. We didn't get our compliment water, napkins, and utensils till all orders arrived. Numerous times have we tried to call a waiter over and cater to us all we got was stares and shut downs. They ignored for about 5 times, as they walked over and looked at us. As we finished up and was ready to pay, we waited at the cashier table for about 20 mins. The so called manager/owner comes through a young skinny Asian boy. He tell him that we are going to split the check into two my friend will pay first and I'll pay second. We have a group of four people and two people on one check the other two on the next check. He tells us we have to figure it our ourselves. We ask for a calculator right in front of him he tells us no you figure it our yourselves. The phones rings as we were try to talk to him he ignores is the whole time. At this point I  furious poor service, and now dealing with an ass of an owner. He tells me to \"shut the fuck up\" \"stop giving him attitude\" he also calls me a \"bitch\". At this point I'm ready to knock his ass out but I have to keep it collective, no one ever talks to me this way I was raised to knock bitches out if I was dissected especially in the way he treated me last night. I tell him \"bitch\" you do not know me don't you ever talk to me in that tone ever again. He then tells me to \"fuck off\" I don't care. I pay give no tip. As we were leaving he then runs outside trying to find security to kick me and my friends out saying we were trespassing when clearly I have to stay to pay the bill unless you want me to have a free meal. I leave he then tells me to \"get the fuck out\". I don't know about you but customer service and being a manager yourself customers are always right and never have I ever in my 25 years of living experience a manager/ owner swear at me. Do not I suggest do no! Ever go to this place ever!!!!!!"

It's primarily a Vietnamese spot but they have a wide variety of dishes but the quality of food doesn't falter. Their hours make it a go-to spot for late night cravings or for sobering up. \n\nFood:  As noted, they have a wide-variety of food despite being a Vietnamese restaurant. Besides the Pho and other dishes they are known for, they can happily serve up delicious selection that are more Chinese or Thai in style. Personally, though I did venture into their Singapore Street Noodles once and was satisfied....I typically stick with their trusty Pho....beef ball to be specific. Once you load that bowl with peppers, mint, sprouts and lime juice (which it's served with)....be ready to enter a fit of delicious rage only to come to your senses when the bowl is empty and you're left wondering what just happened. Seriously, what I inflict on their bowls of Pho could probably be described as a crime of passion in a court of law.....but I digress.\n\nI have tried other peoples' dishes and they are all also amazing. So I doubt you can go wrong.\n\nAtmosphere/Service:\n\nThis place is usually packed but that usually doesn't deter seating time or service. Unless you're rolling up 12 deep after a night of clubbing at XS or something, I doubt you will honestly wait more than 10 minutes to be sat...maybe 20 minutes if people have dignity and can resist eating their food like beasts in a blood rage or they're talking/visiting too long.\n\nAlways, despite what you order....service is usually pretty damn fast. There have seriously been time where I have received my Pho before my drink....and I am ok with that. The only downside to their service is, it may take sometime to get your bill...so if you're going during lunch....start flagging down your server early. \n\n\nOverall, this restaurant is akin to a trusty sidekick: it's always there for you, it welcomes you in with loving arms and it won't judge you when you scarf your food down without shame (like me) or if you rolled in after night of hard partying, possibly with disheveled club clothes (like others)."

One perk is that this place is open 24 hours. It can cure anyone's hangover from a whirlwind night of drinking and partying hard. \n\nThe menu was probably comparable to the expensive las vegas area. The bowls of pho were a little on the pricier end in my opinion. \n\nI thought that since this was supposedly the best rated pho restaurant, I would have very good pho broth. There were limited options for pho since they serve other things on the menu. You only had 5-6 pho combinations to choose from. Although, I did not bother asking whether they would change anything on the menu to your taste. \n\nI was very disappointed that the pho broth was VERY VERY watered down. I felt like I was just drinking a bowl of salted water with MSG in. The broth was pretty much almost clear and without color in the bowl. Must be because they couldn't keep up with the supply and demand of pho and watered it all down or this might just be the quality of the pho broth they had. \n\nI was so disappointed that by the time I got home, I went home to make a gigantic pot of pho broth. I'm Chinese and I feel like my pho broth was even better than theirs. At least it looked like pho broth by appearance. It may make you reconsider going out to eat pho ever again or especially at this place!"

Ironically I put the slices in the broth a little too late, and my last few pieces wouldn't properly cook because the broth was no longer hot enough. I asked for a little more broth too cook those pieces, and they happily obliged (probably with a chuckle, knowing the amateur mistake I made). This pho tasted better usual; to be fair, it could've been because of the previous night that I had, but it was delicious.\n\nI also recommend ordering a fresh young coconut to drink. They give you a coconut with the top cut off, and with a straw to drink and spoon to scrape off some of the meat.

This was my go to pho place when i first moves to Vegas over 10 years ago. Since its been a long I thought I would come back and try it again. But things have changed all lot and not for the better. The soup was a decent size cause when I eat pho I love a lot of soup and a large dish. But there was not much meat or noodles in the bowl. Also the soup was not pipping hot at all. This was the first time ever that I didn't drip one drop of sweat eating my pho. It didn't even cook my raw meat all the way...it was still pink! Also ordered the shrimp spring rolls and too my disappointment they were TINY compared to a lot of other places and a little more pricey. Completely disappointing and definitely not going back there again! Save yourself your money and time and go to another pho place instead. Too many places put there. I am so disappointed in my most recent experience here."

However, I was sharing with a friend who was too afraid to order flank and tripe in the soup, so the absence of these delicious meats might have led to the unfavorable comparison.\n\nAnother thing about my friend, she won't eat flank/tripe, but she'll order an avocado smoothie...as if that's not weird. \nNonetheless, the smoothie was great. Just don't let it get warm, because then you start feeling like you're downing a cup of sweet guacamole."

I have to say I love the pho here...maybe since it was my first pho experience and I compare all others to it. The broth is very clean and flavorful. I like mine with egg noodle instead of rice noodle, which makes it more substantial. I've tried various other dishes and haven't had one I didn't liike yet. My only complaint is rice does not come with many dishes...wtf!, this is an Asian restaurtant how could it not. Having to pay extra for rice seems a little nickle and dimey, but I guess you're at their mercy since it is impossible not to eat rice with your meal here.

STAY AWAY FROM THE HONEY WALNUT SHRIMP. $16.00 and you get a few shrimps that weren't even thoroughly cooked along with poor presentation. The batter covering the shrimp was soft and soggy, you could still taste the powdery batter mix. The portion wasn't even worth $16. The honey walnut shrimp from Panda Express would be a better option. The spring rolls weren't good either. Prices are too high for such bad tasting/mediocre dishes. I've been here a few times before in the past, hoping that each time it would be a better experience than last time but it just gets worse and worse. Honestly, Kim Long is only busy because they have a good location and its open 24/7. You want good Vietnamese food? Go to Pho So 1 or Pho Saigon 8."

The Roast Duck I really wasn't that impressed, but it was after 1am so sometimes that's not a wise choice. I had a cubed beef dish in black pepper sauce, this was the hit of the night! Tender beef cubes with a lot of flavor and very satisfying. Prices weren't too bad & they are open late so after drinks it's a great choice. I will definitely be back soon to experiment with more menu items, but that beef dish is worth the price of admission on it's own :)"

BOY WAS I WRONG!\n\nWe were told it'd be a 20 minute wait so we just took a quick walk down the strip mall. We came back not 5 minutes later and waited another 20 minutes. I eventually go up and ask him when our table will be ready and he said that our names were called like 20 minutes ago. Say what? So apparently a 20 minute wait means 5 minutes now? Get your timing right! So i asked to be put back on the list and there was probably another 4-5 groups that came after me. Well, he sat all of them first. We  only needed a 3-top and all those other groups were pretty much the same size if not larger. I reminded him and he barely even gave me any attention. Eventually we got seated. The service sucked, the food was horrid (none of us finished), and we definitely didn't tip. I know the table next to us was also very unhappy and also didn't tip. You'd be lucky to get anyone's attention since they zip by you at warp speed. \n\nIt was past 3am and I was unfulfilled. I will NEVER be back here. Yelpers, this is fair warning."

Items that were $4-5 or $9-12 are now in the range of $8-12 and $13-18. This is just absurd for some chicken and broccoli. Chinatown is lined with good Vietnamese restaurants and same cold service without the wait. \n\nPho Kim's food is delicious with a much bigger menu, but I'll rather take my business elsewhere since they have gotten so greedy and have forgotten the locals who have kept them in business for the last 15 years or so. Side note: I ordered chicken and string beans (which was always on the menu, now showing as chicken and greens) and there was a $3 up charge for the beans. REALLY? The cashier was so rude, saying how expensive the beans are and that otherwise I'll get bok choy. The order cost me $20 -- $20 for a dish that is $8,75 at ANY amazing Chinese restaurant. This was the last time I paid Pho Kim a visit. I was infuriated with the drive, the wait, the rudeness and extortion. \n\nOn another note, a server was asked about MSG content and it was divulged that they use Massive amounts of MSG in all of their food. If you feel super bloated or tired after eating at their restaurant, know that it is due to this nerve impulse transmitter that has been known to cause brain nerve damage in lab animals (unfortunately, for those little beings). This is one of the reasons why their food is so tasty and addicting. Take away the MSG and it's just plain ol' cup of noodles. \n\nI'm happy taking it up the street when the cravings hit and saving a bunch of money while I am at it."

I would have to say my friends and I were very disappointed with what we ordered.  I couldn't describe the flavor in the broth.  It seem like they just bought the cubes you buy at supermarket to make pho and stuck in the pot.  The egg rolls were thin and barely had any meat.  One of my friends ordered Hu Tieu and didn't finish it because it wasn't good.

It's as if the chef had to rush out so many dishes that he forgets to throw in any key ingredients.  On top of that, service was horrible to say the least.  We asked for a tea refill from 4 different servers and each and every single time we asked... the server would pass it down to another server... and then just moved on about their business to try and seat as many new customers as possible.

No need to go to bed on a stomach of noodles; you need protein to repair your party body!\n\nWhy didn't the pho impress me? Good question. The pho did not impress me because the broth lacked complexity. My favorite thing about pho is the deep sweet but savory flavor of a good broth-- the magic of anise, cloves and beefy bits-- but at Kim Long, the broth had the taste of a glorified, salty chicken broth. Without the broth, you might as well get the chicken noodle soup at Marie Callender's.\n\nI think that Pho Kim Long gets overrated by hungry, sometimes drunkish visitors because it is close to the strip. I love visitors, I do, but we should try to get you some different late night dining options."

When I left I completely forgot about the stroller and immediately called and they said they would put it aside so I could pick it up tomorrow. \nThe next day I come to pick up my stroller they said that someone has already came in to pick it up and that it's not there fault the stroller was left there and it was out of there hands. The manager Ken was very rude and said sorry but there's nothing he can or will do about it.\nBe advise make sure do not leave your personal belongings because even if they do find or have it there big chance you may not get it back."

But I stand by my statement that this is probably the best Pho I've had.\n\nI try to come here at least once every other vegas trip, once me and my buddies came here twice in 1 day, before and after clubbing, its just good.\n\nOne word of advice, the XL bowl is really that, EXTRA large, I normally finish my bowl or my rice dish and the rest of my gf's bowl, but man, I couldn't finish the XL bowl.\n\nThe broken rice dish here is ok, nothing crazy special, same with the egg rolls, the wait is pretty long on Sundays in the 11-12 time, I guess its a good hang over food before you head back home.  This place is also open 24 hours so you can come here at 4am and get the goods, its also a nice pick me up after losing a bunch of money on the tables."

That was my first impression of their Pho Dac Biet (#13 in the menu) a delicious bowl of thinly sliced rare beef, green onions, basil, bean sprouts, fresh basil, jalapeno slices and rice noodles swimming in this AMAZING broth! A dash of Sriracha, Hoisin sauce and a squeeze of lime slivers and you got yourself a bowl of Pho that is simply hard to forget! In an armada of buffets and pretentious eateries in \"Viva Las Vegas\" it is refreshing to find places like this! The best part is...They are open \"almost\" all the time! ( please see hours of operation )\n\nThe place is nice, roomy and clean, the servers are attentive and does their job well. There is plenty of parking as it is located in some sort of a strip mall but don't let the location fool you as this place serves some really well prepared dishes. Try their freshly made spring rolls while waiting for your order, it makes my mouth water just writing this review about it!\n\nAll in all, I have no complaints, I highly recommend Pho Kim Long especially after a hard night of partying in the city that never sleep! \n\nEnjoy!"

They have a wait for a reason specially on weekends when everyone is tried of partying, you'll see some lovely looking people all dressed up and exhausted. Despite the wait, their service is fairly quick as they have many staff that takes care of everyone. The food is quick to your table too.\n\nIf you want the quickest service, stick to their pho. I do believe that they've already have everything pre-made as it's their generating revenue. Speaking of sticking to pho, I've tried some of their food like egg rolls, pad thai, and many more, but nothing special. They are good at making pho and that is all. \n\nI usually get the combination of everything because I hate missing out on the yummiest meat with my soup. The base is oh so delicious because it's quite flavourful. I haven't tasted anything with the right combination of ingredients in any other restaurants. It's not too salty but not too bland either. \n\nMy other concern about this place is that sometimes my soup isn't as hot as I would have imagined. You'd think that they want to serve you hot soup because meat is still cook right before your eyes. Also, every time I go there, it's always too cold. What's up with that? Am I the only one that feels this? \n\nThis place is always bustling with my customers, so if you're not comfortable in crowded places, I suggest going at times when they're not as busy. You'll always get the best service at those times as they're always watching over you. Overall, I think this restaurant is a must try. I do believe there's a better pho place out there, still looking for it!"

It was also served with plain tomato paste as \"dipping sauce\".. Once this was told to the waitress, her respond was \"it's okay\".. and she took the plate away. About 30 seconds later, the manager comes over in a places the plate back on our table. We politely tell him that we did not want it, so we sent it back. The he says, \"I was told that you said it doesn't look like the picture. Please tell me what's different about it.\" I responded by saying that it looked NOTHING like the picture.. however, more importantly, it did NOT taste good. He continues to press the issue stating he disagrees and wanted me to point out exactly how it was different. I again stated to him that the dish did not look AT ALL like the picture, but that wasn't the issue. The calamari did NOT taste good. Plain and simple... Then he said.. \"Well, I cannot take it back just because you don't like how the food looks.\" (Although we kept saying that it was just plain nasty). THEN he says \"You have already eaten most of it, so I cannot take it back.\" Seriously?? We had only eaten 2-3 pieces of it. I called the waitress over who agreed with me saying that the plate looked pretty much the same as it did when she brought it over.. I asked the guy, are you really trying to force me to accept this plate even though I'm telling you this is nasty? Are you guys really doing that bad??? He then responds by saying \"If you won't want to pay for the food you can leave!\" SMH... I've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant in my life. I can't give a review of the restaurant as a whole since we were not allowed to have the full experience; however, I can say that this manager should be fired..."

Also, when i called her out and asked why we were all waiting longer than other people, she had the audacity to tell me off by saying to eat somewhere else. Oh and not to mention that she didn't even give the family seated next to us any menus whatsoever. Talk about lazy service. What a shame. I've been going here faithfully for years and service is going down the drain. Did I forget to say how it took me FIVE times to call a waiter to get boxes for my leftovers? And don't expect anybody checking you frequently to see if your dining experience. They clearly made eye contact with me and ignored me, particularly the ones whom the hostess would be talking to. She's turning this restaurant into a high school vibe with all the rude and immature employees. it's ridiculous. The one star is only for the nice lady who checked on our waters and my family enjoyed their pho.\nBest vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas, what a lie. Go to any other pho place but this! The service gets worse and worse and i finally can't take coming here anymore! I hate this place with a passion now!\nIf you are one of the employees and you read this, remember: we customers pay your pay check. No respect, no money. no customers. You lost 4 faithful families of customers tonight. And earned a visit from a health inspector for the bad quality food you  gave my family. Hope you like That Visit as your early Christmas present."

Overall the egg roll and dumpling we ordered was really good. The server didn't really check if we needed anything. Then the server comes and ask if we ordered fried rice, he realize it was the wrong table of guests. We had to ask the server for more water and for our check. We had a group of 6 people, they even messed up on our check so I had to tell them to refund me for paying something I didn't order. I think I'll stick to Lee's sandwich next door."

Two words you cannot put together for any other Vietnamese restaurants ;D\nThe only downside is that it is off the strip, so getting a cab back is...... IMPOSSIBLE. But still worth it.\nI came her in the afternoon after three consecutive nights of partying until 6am. I was sober and not hungover, so I know the food was good!\nA quick cab ride away from Aria, roughly about $12-13 or so without tip. Located in a plaza or square, but we didn't look around and went straight for business. The windows/doors were darkened so you couldn't peep inside. Once you walk in you will realized this place is rather big, and set like a Chinese seafood/dim sum restaurant.\nHad to use the restroom, and they have automatic flush. I don't believe I have seen this at any Asian restaurants before! And the bathroom had many stalls and was actually clean. BIG BIG PLUS!\nFood came pretty quickly. I ordered cha gio (egg rolls), 4 stars. Sorry no pix as it was far from me since we had a large group. It was mighty tasty with a variety of fillings. \nPho bo vien (beef ball pho) - 4.5 stars! I think that was about $7, so it is a little more pricey than your ghetto places, but I think I would rather spend extra money for clean, good food. Soup tasted yummy and authentic, and the regular bowl was actually not too big for me for once. They gave you plenty of bean sprouts, basil, limes, and jalepenos so you don't have to fight your friends...... PLUS!\nI tried my friend's potstickers, they were crunchy with a pork and veggie filling. It was juicy and tender on the inside. The sauce that accompanied it was well seasoned. It was seasoned soy sauce or something with spring onions. YUMMMMMM.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA?select=EGVRX4BXHP6Vm10J6JrTJA\nI ordered a coconut juice as well, that crap was expensive! I think $5 or something, but it tasted so good :)\nEveryone seemed pretty happy with their food. And I would say the dishes all looked yummy.\nI will be back..... if I decide to stand outside for 20-30 minutes trying to catch a cab again. We'll see........"

This place makes great Chinese food, definitely worth leaving the strip for.\n\nThe pho is supposed to be awesome and I plan on having that next time."

And we waited another 20 mins for our order to be taken. We came in with a large group and even after waiting an hour we didn't get to sit together cause I guess It's too difficult to push tables together. And they were so pushy about separating us from each other. Everyone who works here looks so miserable while they're working like they hate their life. The service here is so rude that it just ruins the meal for you. Also the tables who were sat after us received their food and water way after us. Pho Kim Long is so dysfunctional, unorganized, and has one of the work customer service I have ever received. I'm sure there are other pho places in Vegas that are way better than this."

Hated it.\nWe ordered some beef entree and they didn't give it to us until near the end of the meal. Even after several reminders. Idk how the rest of the food was because I was too busy trying to eat the horrible calamari.\nMy water was only refilled once. 20 minutes after it's been sitting at the edge of the table completely empty.

We stayed at the Rio this time so this place was literally down the street. Decided we wanted to try this place out cause we didn't want to pay $20 for buffet at the casino. This place is pretty good. I ordered a bowl of pho dac biet which was like almost $8 and my hubby ordered the vermicelli with egg rolls and charbroiled beef for around $8. Our meal combined was less than $20.\n\nLater that night my friend wanted pho so I came back with her and this time I ordered the vermicelli with egg roll and charbroiled beef and she ordered the pho. It was equally yummy. I like how they have so much choices of pho, rice plates, vermicelli, etc.  \n\nA lot of people come here so this place does get packed. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll most likely come back here cause their food is so yummy. I like how it's open really late so you can go anytime like after clubbing. Pho is a good hangover remedy :)"

Quic Tip: If it's packed, and you don't want to wait for a table, you can order your food to go, it's faster! Also you can even call ahead and they can have your order ready for you by the time you get there. Oh and if you are planning to go there on Sunday for dinner, be prepared to wait!  I always recommend this place to out of town friends who are looking for after hours grub, especially after drinking... and they never fail to impress. I think that they are a little bit pricey for a vietnamese restaurant, and the customer service could be a bit better on some days, especially when packed... but overall, i still like going here. My fave dishes are the grilled pork chop, salted fish fried rice, calamari and wonton noodle soup."

It seemed there was a prefixed menu negotiated for our large party, and it consisted of the typical Vietnamese family-style menu items you would see standard in any restaurant worth their salt.\n\nFor a pho restaurant, this is probably one of the nicer looking ones I've seen... of course, this is targeted towards the touristy crowds, but still a breath of fresh air compared to all of the hole-in-the-walls I've been to.  I asked around about Vietnamese restaurants, and even the cab driver [local native Vietnamese] recommended this place, and it did not disappoint.  We had canh chua, ca kho, fried rice, fried shrimp, etc... and it was so nice to have home style food to end our weekend of debauchery and make us miss home even more.  [5 days in Vegas is overkill... 3 IS MORE than enough for me!]\n\nThe part that made me happiest?  The had fresh coconut juice there, and when you order it, they serve you nothing else but a coconut straight up.  I had oodles of fun scraping at the meaty flesh to round out my meal, and we all left stuffed.  If I remember right, we had at least 4-5 tables and I don't remember the cost, but I do know it was quite cheap because I heard no one complaining... haha.\n\nAlso, for not having any reservations, the food came out promptly and steaming hot.

It seemed kind of bland and flavorless. \nThe portions are big enough to share and prices are beyond reasonable. Service was fast and friendly. AND I noticed they're opened 24hrs, YAS! All in all, I'm definitely coming back!"

She felt the need to come tell US to keep our baby laughter down :-/ REALLY?? The people that had the children RUNNING around didn't have a word said to them. Plus this restaurant is not a quiet place at all so I have no idea what got up her butt :-/ This kept us away for awhile then we decided to pop back in and we haven't seen that girl since so we happily came back :-) I actually would give this place 5 stars if the workers are a little friendlier and the service was better. If your a thirsty person plan on staying that way because its hard to get the workers attention for another beverage."

Four stars for the Pho which was very good, though the flavor was not as strong or authentic as places like LA or New York. One star for the service. Server was a little rude and took until almost the end of our meal to bring our drinks. I had the mango smoothie, thinking it would have actual mango in it, but no. It was sickly sweet and very artificial tasting, I couldn't even drink it but also couldn't find my server to send it back, so ended up paying for it even though I didn't like or drink it. Our server disappeared after hurriedly dropping off our drinks, and 45 minutes after we were done eating and obviously waiting were we finally able to flag down another server to bring our check. We might be back because the Pho was tasty and they are open late, but hopefully the service will be better at normal dinner hours. Not a great first experience."

The restaurant is located in the Chinatown area on Spring Mountain.  It does get very crowded and busy during lunch hours and parking can be tough sometimes.  Expect a wait when you come during lunch hours.  They have a full menu of dishes, including rice, bun, and chow fun.  But I always order pho every time I come.  The broth is tasty and super hot (just the way I like it).  The service can sometimes be slow or lacking because they are so busy.  They do take the major credit cards, including Mastercard, Visa, and Discover, but NOT American Express.  Anyways, when we are in Vegas and need our Pho fix, this is the place I like to go."

I decided to come here after looking through yelp reviews for the most reviewed pho restaurants in China town. \n\nDefinitely 5 stars for cleanliness and promptness in their service for an Asian restaurant. This was probably the most clean Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. Decor was modern and restaurant was big - great for big group gatherings or late night munching. They seemed fully staffed so whatever you asked for was done quickly. \n\nPho Kim Long serves many other dishes, both Vietnamese and Chinese food, so there's a lot to choose from. I ordered Beef Pho and was very satisfied with my selection. The beef slices were very tender! The portion of beef was generous in the size \"small\" bowl. I have to compliment them on their soup - I know every pho restaurant uses MSG but this place seemed to use it sparingly. I wasn't super thirsty after eating and did not have a problem slurping up the soup either =) \n\nThis will definitely be my go-to spot if I'm ever back to visit! Come hungry, leave satisfied...especially after a long night of partying =D \n\nHappy Eating yelpers!"

My mother and I had gone right now and had ordered some food and one of the many foods we ordered was Chicken Pad Thai. When our dish came out and we ate couple chopstick full & looked at this so called \"chicken\" that was thinly sliced, chewy and what seemed and look like fat attached was simply \"pork\". \n\nLike any customers would, we called over our waiter, he took it back unsure as well than ANOTHER waiter aggressively came back with the dish and claimed it was chicken. We argued about this for several mins & because we didn't want to make a bigger scene we told him to take the dish back. \n\nNOW, this next part gets better. As we continue to eat our rest of the food, the waiter and his other employees gather around near by we were sitting and have the nerves to talk about our situation and laugh about it. So, as a customer I was furious. Asked for the manager to let him be aware of his employees behavior. Of course -_- manager isn't any better with his behavior so possibly that's why his employees aren't any better either -_- so anyways, manager comes to our table, not making any eye contact with me and fights for his employees (which is understandable defending his employees). Finally got an apology and ended the conversation. \n\nThis gets even better, once the check arrives, we were charged for Chicken Pad Thai (in most case in other restaurants, the dish is taken off the check) so we only paid for what we only ate and with that kind of a crappy service, we didn't leave tip. As we were leaving, the manager came out to our car and told us we didn't pay enough. This is how the conversation went:\n\nManager: \"you didn't pay enough!\"\nMe: \"no, we paid for what we ate.\"\nManager: \"shut up!\"\n\nSo at this point, I was beyond furious and got out of our car and went up to him and he had the nerve to say he didn't tell me to shut up. So now I'm apparently gone crazy and hearing things -_- then he aggressively argues with me that I didn't pay enough, so I had to RE-EXPLAIN to him that we ONLY paid for what we actually ate and not what was taken back (since we didn't eat it!). \n\nThis is where he failed miserably as a manager...not only did he verbally fight back, tell me to shut up, but he had his biggest nerves to tell me my service was unwanted there and for me to \"go to hell\". \n\nUhm, are you serious right now?! How in the world can a restaurant manager say all that to a customer?????!!!!!! My mind was so blown away. Un-freaking-believe-able! For sure NEVER going back there and it is such a disappointment cause I been going there for many years now. I seriously think they are so full of it!     \n\nThis doesn't even deserve a (1) star but I have to give something to leave a review...FML -_-"

He rolled his eyes and laughed at me while I was talking to him about our service & food.\nI used to enjoy coming to this place but I will NEVER be back & make sure to let everyone know they're very unprofessional & treat their customers like shit."

Every restaurant has a bad night and I have been going to Pho Kim Long since before moving to Las Vegas. The service is efficient and the food always delivers, whether you are there at 7pm or 4 in the morning. But recently I had an experience that has put me off of my beloved go-to spot possibly forever. \n\nIt all started on a busy Friday night around 3am. I had a craving for some Pho after work. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table because they were jam packed, slammed, crazy busy. No problem. I get it. Not the end of the world. \nHowever, once we were finally sat all the way in the back in a corner, nobody came to take our order. There were servers, bussers and runners all scurrying around us too busy to even take a beverage order. The first 10 or so minutes I can forgive but when I actively am trying to flag someone down and literally every employee refuses to make eye contact, even I start to get frustrated. We became the table that time forgot. \n\n15 minutes...20 minutes go by.\n25 minutes in and we still don't even have a glass of water. We have now been at Pho Kim Long for a total of 40 minutes with nothing to show for it. But I refuse to be that person who makes a scene and leaves, so I wait it out. \nI FINALLY flag down the guy bussing the table next to ours and he brings us some waters and promises to send the server over. She comes over looking rather (understandably) bedraggled and we very politely put in our order after explaining our situation. She offers no apology and acts as if it's not a big deal. So I'm a little peeved at the lack of reaction. But my pho is on the way and my stomach is growling. \nMy beautiful bowl of soup is placed before me and I turn my attention away from the negative experience and grab my chopsticks. And then I see it...gently floating amongst my rice noodles, swimming in my delicious broth without a care in the world is...a...\nCOCKROACH. \n\nI stand up, push my bowl away and just point in astonishment and horror. My confused dinner companion sees what I am pointing at and flags down the nearest employee who proceeds to whisk the dish away before I have a chance to gather my wits and take a picture. So now we are both standing at the table trying to figure out what to do. NOBODY comes back over to inquire about us or make amends. So we look at each other, nod and start walking towards the front door. On the way I find our server and take her aside to calmly explain the entire situation and inform her that we are leaving. And I again get a complete non reaction. No apology, no manager. Just an ok and a bewildered stare.\n\nI'm done."

Thank goodness for Pho Kim Long. Walking in there the Pho smell is pretty much hugging you like a warm blanket. The place is huge and not fancy by any means. The service was fast and without frills. We had the fresh spring rolls and pot stickers. I always eat Pho Ga (chicken Pho), it was delicious! For all you folks that suffer like me from the unexplainable cilantro-phobia I asked them if they could leave it out. They actually did. That's not common, often they say they do, but if e.g. the chicken is prepared in advance en masse, they try to take it out, more or less successful. And if you are like me, even if you can't see it and you bite into one little piece of cilantro-that's it. I can't eat the dish. The broth was so flavorful, the chicken not dry, the condiments were plenty and fresh. We will be back!"

I was asked to be seated inside and spot a long table that enough for my family.  The waiter was refuse and said if we want to sit inside then we have to split into 3 corners.  What the F?  I understand if the restaurant is full.  But it is quite emply on that day.  I screwed at them and walk out and NEVER come back to this restaurant again.   WORST WORST AND WORST EXPERIENCE EVER HAD!"

And the few pieces of tendon I did find had no flavor.\n\nThe 45 minute wait (12 person party) really had me thinking about going next door for banh mi. The disappointing pho made me wish that I did.\n\nAlso everyone ordered small bowls and one person ordered a large. The gave everyone large bowls and the one person a small order..."

They made it nice and little a bit elegant. \nEven though it is more like casual menus, it can make it seem like a dine-in good restaurant with fun environment. not too serious.\n\ngood to hang with friends, date. Maybe not with your family. No quite time. \nLooking for more of elegant, quite, serious, romantic place, I don't recommend.\n\n\nFood is about 3.9. They are above average but not craving Their food."
