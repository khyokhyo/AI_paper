            "review": "Seems each visit here tops the last. Enjoyed dinner here the other night and let me start by saying our server, Lance was quite impressive. He was on point in every way. From the first hello to the very last thank you and good bye he was super attentive, touched the table just the right amount of times and made sure we were truely enjoying our experience. The guests that were with me all commented on how great a server he was as well. \n\nWe all enjoyed different dishes and were all very satisfied. I was able to enjoy the mini tacos (listed as an appetizer but more than enough to fill in as a meal). The 3 bite tacos were topped with a mayo like sauce which added tons of flavor. Another guest had the ahi salad and was warned that the ponzu sauce can be a salty so don't pour it all on at once and FYI...That was a VERY good warning. Salad was good but be careful not to pour it all on. Kids were able to share a foot long hot dog and mini burgers, they enjoyed it. \n\nEnded with a frozen Oreo hot chocolate! So Goooodddd!!! \nAgain..left a satisfied customer."

Sounds heavy, but it was mighty refreshing. And two other good things.\n1.) You can buy it at the express window. \n2.) You can sip it under a covered outdoor tent that is constantly spraying mist to cool down the temperature. \n\nIf you can't fly to NY, this place is pretty good place to try Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, especially cause the weather is sooooooooo hot."

            "review": "I dinned here for the frozen hot chocolate, I was intrigued on how this would taste and was pleasantly surprised at how yummy this really was. It was not overly sweet and tasted like hot chocolate frozen. The decor is nice and the restaurant is clean. My husband ordered the club sandwich, it tasted fresh like the meat was just sliced and the portion was the right size for the price. I ordered the taco salad, it came out neat with taqitos sticking out. The taco salad was good, not the best ive had but good. The staff was friendly and attentive which sets the tone for my meals, I am big on customer service and feel other than the quality of food the type of service is what is going to aid into weather i would go again. This is defiantly a place i would go back to, not sure if i would order the taco salad again, but there is other stuff on the menu id like to try."

Upon walking in, we didn't have to wait for a table considering it's a Friday night. The decor had a very candy vibe. You know when you watch the Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory? It was like that. \n\nOnce we were seated, we were given these huge menus to look at. It's like the size of a 4 year old baby. \nI ordered the Portobello Mushroom Burger and my lovely girlfriend decided on Penne Vodka Pasta With Sausage.   For dessert, we settled on a Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate. \n\nOur waiter Carlos, was very kind and recommended me to get the combo of a burger and hot chocolate since it was cheaper. He also was very attentive and told us the food would be coming out shortly. \n\nThe food service comes out fast. Once I dove in my burger like how Trey Songz dives in, it tasted very good. The meat was cooked perfectly. The burger was very large and it couldn't fit in my mouth. LOL\nIt also came with a side of fries, which were crispier than your pair of Jordan's. \n\nMy girlfriend enjoyed her Penne Vodka Pasta with toasted bread on top. The vodka sauce tasted just right like how I asked my girl to be my girlfriend. \nIt was a huge plate so we took most of it to go. \n\nFrozen hot chocolate was good. It actually was a resemblance of a slushy. But overall, a nice experience to try it out since it was our first time here. \n\nPrices here are worth the money if you actually know what you're gonna get. \n\nComing back here again."

Also probably the most expensive hot dog I ever had. But at the same time, it was one of the tastiest hot dogs I ever had. I just loved it. This homemade bun had a rich buttery flavor. I couldn't get enough.\n\nI also ordered \"Can't Say No sundae\" $14 (Humble pie, vanilla ice cream, coffee ice cream, banana, peanuts, hot fudge, topped with whipped cream), and it was a little too rich for me. I'm the person who's not so crazy about fudge or whipped cream."

It came with a side of sweet potato fries which were cooked to the perfect texture to my liking.  Then my friends and I shared the Traditional Frozen Hot Chocolate.  Umm..it was slightly disappointing because it was more like a melting ice cream.  But at least I can say that I tried it.  \n\nThe atmosphere of this place is super cute!  It's very pink!  They sell Serendipity t-shirts, chocolates, Hello Kitty items, and a bunch of other cute things.  \n\nSuggestion:  Call at least 2 hours in advance to make a reservation if you plan to eat there.  They have a nice patio overlooking the strip so if it's nice out, I suggest reserving a table to eat outside!"

            "review": "We only came for dessert, so what looked like a very generic American menu, was something we didn't have to suffer through.  We stuck with their renowned frozen hot chocolate dessert.  It was great.  I got the peanut butter variation and it was like sucking a Reese's peanut butter cup through a straw - this could become an addiction.  The standard frozen hot chocolate my wife ordered was also excellent.  Our friends ordered the cheesecake - which was gargantuan.  Normally, a dessert that size is a warning size, but they said it was actually very good.  Thumbs up for this Vegas reincarnation of Serendipity."

The bartender gave me an average drink with three little anorexic olives on a pick.  Later in the day it was hot and we wanted to stop for cocktails again.  We sort of stumbled upon Serendipity.   The a/c was going and the Dodgers game was on TV so we chose to sit at the bar.  Jesse was our bartender and I placed my usual order.  His Bloody Mary was top notch!  Full of flavor, fresh delicious and he by the way heard my request for extra olives.  I got six firm extra large olives (2 picks of 3 BIG olives!)!!!!!  I asked how did he get so much flavor in there.   He said their vodka is infused with peppers, onions & celery and pointed to the large decanter with fresh veggies floating inside. Delish!  Great job Jesse, we will be back!!!!"

            "review": "I wouldn't really recommend this place... although the restaurant looks really cute and nice to dine in, you can find better food elsewhere. I find that they completely overpriced their food and it wasn't worth it at all. My group ordered mac and cheese, Margarita pizza, and a salad. I know those things are pretty usual items, but I was completely disappointed by it. So many add ons with charges-- which I didn't mind, but it just sucked how unworthy it was. I got the mac and cheese and added grilled chicken to it. ~$25 dollars. I thought it was fine because I was expecting something tasty but I was so so disappointed. It was soooo bland and literally had 3 pieces of DICED chicken. Take in mind your paying $5 more, you should be given more than 3 pieces of cubes. Anyways, food is mediocre. You can find better food for a better piece elsewhere.\n\nI'm giving this place a 3 star because my server was really good and the frozen mint hot chocolate was pretty amazing. Super tasty, no overly iced, and a large portion. My server was attentive and quick on getting our orders. \n\nI'll probably come back for hot chocolates but not food anymore."

(I know I know it's pink it's cute but not worth it) \n\n- the employees all look like they are tired of their lives and everyone else!(service sucks) \n- the outside has no mist spray so when it's hot out its unbearable \n- the pink cover of the restaurant gives you a major headache ( sit inside) \n- took an hour to get our food after ordering\n- the chef sucks!! Food is bland nothing special\n- the hot frozen chocolate is stupid $10- to $15 worth of chocolate powder and whip cream \n- my veggie burger patty was gross!! The fries tasted like jack in the box\nDrive thru\n-we had to keep asking for our food\nBecause the chefs took so long an hour if not more ( I was super hungry) \n- the menus are cute but too freaking big!!! \n-overpriced for bland food id rather go to the wicked spoon buffet in Cosmo.\n\nTake my advice serendipity 3 executives\nAnd chef.. Simplify your menu and hire a whole new kitchen crew in addition to the one you already have.. It shouldn't take so long for food to arrive on each table.. People are paying and when they pay they demand and you unfortunately don't supply. Just because you're busy and have a bunch of people coming in through ur doors everyday doesn't mean you don't need to change.. Everybody is leaving disappointed so take time to listen to your customers needs."

The wait was definitely doable, especially since the hostess takes your phone number and online updates are texted to you informing you how many parties are ahead of you. Once we were seated, our server was quick to take our orders and make us feel welcome. I ordered the LV burger and my boyfriend ordered the ABC burger - both were delicious. Finally, we had our frozen hot chocolate, and this treat alone made the high prices tolerable. This was definitely an awesome experience and is a must-do for people visiting Vegas."

We got seated 5 minutes upon arrival - which wasn't bad. However, it was after we got seated when things started to turn downhill.\n\nIt took them 10 minutes to get our drink orders (when all we wanted was ice cold water). Took them another 15 minutes on top of that to take our food orders. & the worse part? It took about 45 minutes for our food to come out! Service is not even worth the 2 stars, but I will give it to them just for the food being mediocre and for the delicious Frrrozen Hot Chocolate!"

Unfortunately, I love the NYC location WAY more. This one is much larger and the service is great, but I just didn't have the exact same feeling walking into this one in comparison with the NYC one.\n\nThe wait was significantly shorter though I must say. In NYC, we waited like 30-45 minutes for a table and the place is cramped. This location we waited only 10 minutes. But still, it just lacked a certain charm to it all.\n\nThe menu is very extensive and very large! Literally!\nBut the most famous thing to order is their Frozen Hot Chocolate. Luckily, my boyfriend and I shared. I was tempted to get my own but I just couldn't do it. It's HUGE! It was pretty yummy and not overly sweet. My boyfriend normally doesn't like chocolate desserts but he seemed to like this one. \n\nOverall, come here for the dessert and ambiance...it's very cute and makes you feel like a kid again!"

I loved the theme they have going on, their decorations and I even thought their way-over-sized menus were cool.  The service started off really well.  We were seated immediately and our server was very friendly and peppy.  I think she knew it was our first time so she helped to hype things up for us.  However, the service slowly went downhill as she failed to check on us.  We had to get her attention and not the other way around.  I know it got busy while we were there and maybe she had a few too many tables to wait on but it took forever to get her to come back to the table and also took forever for her to give us our bill.  \n\nI had the Peanut Butter Frozen Hot Chocolate which was really yummy but deceiving.  The portion looks huge and comes in a large glass bowl but there was seriously more whipped cream than hot chocolate in the serving.  It was also a little pricey-a little over $10.  It would be worth it if I had gotten more frozen hot chocolate than whipped cream.  \n\nMy friend had the frozen hot chocolate as well and noticed the same thing-way too much whipped cream.  She also ordered the chili, which in my opinion was very good but also very spicy.  She didn't enjoy it at all and barely touched it because of the spiciness.  Nowhere on the menu did it mention that the chili was spicy.  Again, deceiving.  Even though the chili was good, the menu should have specified that it's spicy because not all patrons enjoy spicy food.  We complained to our server and she did have it taken off the bill.    \n\nI would definitely return to Serendipity and try other things on their menu.  I would also ask for light whipped cream, or maybe hold the whipped cream altogether just to see if they will give more frozen hot chocolate that way.  Maybe our server had an off day which is why service turned out to be slow, who knows?  I think they're worth the second chance.  \n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate:  4/5\nVery delicious but too much whipped cream and not enough frozen hot chocolate.\n\nCustomer Service:  3/5\nStarted off well but ended up being really slow.  They earned extra point for removing a food item from our bill.\n\nPrice:  3/5\nWe paid for more than what we got.  \n\nLocation:  5/5\nWho doesn't want a nice view of Caesars Palace and the Las Vegas Strip while sipping on frozen hot chocolate?!"

It is bit small for what looks to be a bigger space, at least on the inside.  It's nice and pink in here for the ladies and a nice looking bar area for the men.  They have a nice outdoor seating area, but too cold during December.  It would probably be really nice in the april-june months when it is not so unbearably hot.  \n\nThis is a good place to get desserts with you girlfriends that's if you are having a weekend in Vegas.\n\nI had the Summer Bries. It is an open face sandwich.  Presentation is a definite plus with the cone wise fries. The Brie was not melted enough. There was a whole lot of turkey. Good cranberry cheese spread. Overall fair. Sweet potato fries good.  \n\nMy boyfriend got The Full Monty and the ciabatta bread was so good!\nThe Hangover omelet was so big and looks very filling.\nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate was fair.

Warning: reliving Fear & Loathing here could get you arrested or you will never leave! \n\nService: Friendly and helpful, a little overzealous with table cleanup. Where'd my napkin go? \n\nFood: Serendipity 3 is a great dessert stop without a doubt, and with the new location next to Caesar's in the prime crossroads where Paris is just across the street, the location couldn't be better. Hit it big at the craps table? Reward yourself with the $1000 Golden Opulence Sundae, then drive away in a new Ferrari! \n\nOkay, reality time, the dice game just wasn't in my favor, but I did enjoy my meal here. We got seated immediately with a party of 8 on a Thursday night. First course: Spinny Dippin' spinach artichoke dip with freshly-made tortilla chips and real bits of good-quality Reggiano cheese that melted before your eyes, so tasty! I also got to sample the Madras Mojito with cranberries muddled within the mint, it was very flavorful and went down smoothly. Dinner course consisted of an ABC Burger: avocado, brie, and caramelized onions all combined within a single bite that harmonizes the sweetness of the perfectly-cooked, golden-brown onions, blended with the tang of the brie, and mildness of the avocado performed a symphony of Beethoven-like proportions and encored perfectly with sweet potato fries. Excellent indeed! Finally dessert was served, a Peanut Butter Frrrrrrozen Hot Chocolate finished off a perfect meal. Sure there are more dressy establishments with big name chefs to be found on The Strip, but Serendipity 3 delivers not only for your sweet cravings, but a main course too. As always, leave room for dessert!"

When we were seated, the hostess took us to a table that was still dirty and didn't have setups. We wiped the crumbs off ourselves since the hostess didn't seem to notice/care that it was still dirty and then waited over 5 minutes for our waitress. She was friendly, but we had to ask her twice for setups. We ordered salads which took over 30 minutes to bring to the table, and when they came out, 2/3 of them were wrong. \nThey had to remake my dad's which took 15 minutes and the rest of us just waited for him. My brother and I split a salad and we had to ask 3 different people for an extra plate, despite already telling the waitress we were going to split. My mom ordered her salad with no croutons, and it came out with croutons and she's gluten-free. We spoke to the manager who then delivered my dad's salad minutes later, and his salad was comped, but to be honest the entire experience was unpleasant. The food wasn't that great and it didn't come out quickly for being literally lettuce and heated up meat. \n\nOverall, we decided we had no interest in coming back."

Outdoor and indoor seating available. Also have counter service; other side of the restaurant. Full bar.  It's located right outside of Caesars Palace!!\n\nGo if it's slow, but I would not wait in line for the food, there are plenty of places to eat and drink on the strip.\n\nA sundae can run you 13.00 and up!!"

For dessert we had the cookie sunday - again amazing. This place is known for their desserts so they def delivered.\n\nThe reason I give it 3 stars (and im assuming this is also why the place only is rated at 3 stars) is that they are so super freakin SLOWWWW! We had to wait an hour for brunch. And we went for brunch cuz I heard the dinnertime wait can go up to as long as 2 hours! No freakin way I was waiting 2 hours. Then after we were seated our waiter took forever in between serving us. After he brought us our sandwich we literally didn't see him again for another 30 min. I asked him for a refill on coffee which he never brought. Then after we finished our dessert, we were waiting for awhile again to get our check so my hubby just got up and went and found him to pay.\n\nThis place has great food but their slow service is really wat kills it."

Ice cream is supposed to be their thing, so they really need to bring up the standard here because it was NOTHING special at all, and was in fact substandard.  It's in a good location and it's good to see the site right on the strip of Ceasar's being utilized but the decorating could use some oomph and you have to go outside the restaurant to a public bathroom that was like a parking garage bathroom and it was very cold out there.  I'll go to one of the gelato places next time instead."

Honestly, we would have been better off going to the food court inside of caesar's. The only safe thing to order there is the frozen hot chocolate and maybe sundaes. Don't waste your money on the hot dogs/burgers/salads."

I mean lines wrapping around and everything!  That means it must be good, right? So on one of my recent trips, I decided to brave the sun and the long line and tried me some Serendipity.\n\nI only tried one thing on the menu so this review will be a short one.  I had the much talked about Frozen Hot Chocolate.  It was decent, the serving size was overkill, and it was a truly decadent and rich treat.  It was just a little too sweet and powdery for my liking and I think it had more whipped cream than actual frozen hot chocolate.  I think I would much rather spend my money inside Caesar's Palace at a delicious dessert shop with the best macarons ever.  For a frozen hot chocolate though, I think I'll stick with San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square.\n\nThis ice cream shop is sickeningly cute.  Like every other place on The Strip, the theme is rampant and the atmosphere is worth a few selfies for Instagram.  Stop by if you're an ice cream fanatic.  I hope you don't mind the wait and the obvious tourist trap that makes up Serendipity."

You can walk up to a counter and order to go or you can dine inside or on the outside patio. When you walk into the dining room with it's pink walls and oversized lamps hanging from the ceiling, you literally feel like you've fallen through the rabbit hole... but not a good one, because I really like Alice in Wonderland/Through The Looking Glass, and that concept would be fascinating... This was maybe more like a prairie dog hole... or a meerkat or something. This is the second time I've been here. \n\nService: We asked to move to a booth and were graciously reseated at one. However, the new server was not very attentive. One of my friends asked for green tea and the server stated that she wasn't sure if they had run out and she would check. She didn't follow up until I asked her about it, to which she replied \"Oh, we ran out\". I am always kind to servers and I understand that it's not easy to run around at people's command, but the dining room was not busy (unless she had diners outside on the patio). We waiting some time for a menu to order dessert and also for the check. ONe of my friends told me that the last few times she'd been there, she had not great service as well. \n\nFood: I ordered fish tacos, my friends ordered the BLT, vodka Penne and chicken sandwich. Everyone's food was alright, but nothing to blow your socks off. I think soft shells would have been better for the tacos, but that's a matter of preference. We got the some crazy hot fudge brownie sundae to share which was DELICIOUS! I've gotten the frozen hot chocolate in the past and it was pretty rad too. \n\nOverall: I think the service being subpar and the food being mediocre led me to subtracting 2 stars. That dessert though... I think they should just specialize in dessert!"

We were completely star struck due to the fact that she was sitting at the table right next to us! Anyways, back to the food..\n\nI ordered the TBLT (Turkey bacon lettuce and tomato) sandwich with the Sweet potato fries. The portion was pretty big and I was unable to finish my sandwich and fries. The Sweet potato fries were the best that I've ever had. They were crunchy and also had some sort of brown sugar on top of it, to give it a much sweeter taste. By the time I was finished with half of my sandwich and fries, my friend Jenn and I shared a Frozen Hot Chocolate. When it arrived, there was some chocolate drowning at the bottom of the plate. It was good and very filling. I was stuffed by the end of that meal. \n\nThe service was good considering the fact that we were surrounded by paparazzi. Our waiter was very attentive and quick. This place was a little pricey, but it's on the strip so nothing is really cheap."

Don't bother going if you aren't going to order the hot chocolate.\n\nWe came here for dinner on our final full day of Vegas. My friend wanted to go here because she loves their frozen hot chocolates. It was only about a five minute walk from our hotel (The Flamingo). When we put our name down, the hostess told us we'd have to wait around 20-25 minutes for a table, even though there were empty tables and no wait list at the time. Weirdly, exactly 25 minutes passed when we received our text that our table was ready. We went in and were seated at the table (that was definitely empty when we first went in). \n\nMy BF and I were Kind of sugared out at this point in our Vegas trip so we decided not to get the hot chocolate. He got a pizza and I got the Ahi Tuna salad because I wanted something light. When the did cane out, evening looked great. The color contrast and arrangement of my salad was beautiful. On closer inspection though, I noticed that the tuna was a lot redder than most so that I've seen. I brushed it off and we all dug in.\n\nZthe fist but was not bad, but as I ate more of my salad it tasted worse and worse. I started to notice an overly fishy taste to the ahi, and the sauce that was both on the side and drizzled all over the salad got more and more overwhelmingly sweet. In the end, I couldn't even finish it because it was so drenched in sweet sauce. My BF was also having trouble eating his pizza, and he's the type that always eats everything. He couldn't handle the overwhelming amount of cheese on his pizza (equal parts cheese and crust) and ending up just eating the toppings.\n\nI don't think I would come back here again unless it was to try the hot chocolate, and even then, I'd be hesitant."

I could have made this at home for $2.  I want my 45 minutes of life back so I can spend it throwing money at strippers.\n\nService was super nice and friendly and the store was cute in the over colored circus kind of way.

I was in Vegas on vacation and was excited to try the Nevada version of my favorite restaurant.  My friend and I got there and waited about 30 minutes to be seated.  Not too bad considering I once waited 2 hours for a table in NYC.  We looked at the menu and were ready to order, but unfortunately, no waitress showed up for at least 20-25 minutes.  Once the expression on my face showed I was slightly annoyed, a waitress came over and asked if we were being helped.  We weren't.  Strike one.\n\nWe had a coupon for a free Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, one of my favorite treats.  Well....they brought it out and the first thing I noticed was that they did not use fresh whipped cream, it was Reddi-Wip.  Also, it was a much smaller portion than Serendipity in New York.  The Frrrozen Hot Chocolate wasn't made correctly..very watery.  We didn't really drink it.  Strike two.\n\nThe food was alright.  I won't give them any strikes for that.  I enjoyed my grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup.  \n\nWe ordered our favorite New York desserts and again were slightly disappointed.   I ordered the Coward's Portion Banana Split and the lady was in such a hurry, I didn't get to tell her which ice cream and toppings I wanted.  The original location always asks me if I want to customize.  Strike three. \n\nOverall, the Las Vegas location is OKAY.  It's not terrible, but if you LOVE Serendipity 3 in New York, I wouldn't recommend it.  You'll just be disappointed.  If you have never eaten at the original Serendipity 3, I'd say go for it!  You probably won't know the difference and you'll have a good meal.  Unfortunately, I found myself comparing the two locations the entire night.  Again, it might be unfair to do so, but I simply don't believe this location lives up to that famous Serendipity 3 name."

However I really wanted carrot cake (which he said was huge) he recommended the carrot cake sundae and to just have the carrot cake (a slice that's smaller than the order) on the side. We went with the sundae and 1 order of frozen hot chocolate. The sundae came out and it was massive and my slice of carrot cake was huge, I couldn't even finish it. I'm so glad he told us about the portions because it would have gone to waste."

The restaurant is apart of the Caesar Palace Casino but stays on the outside along side the strip so its easy to find and see. Its a restaurant that has a to go section outside for customers who don't want to dine in. The d\u00e9cor is very 50's cute diner with a Greek twist on the outside.\n\nWhen your inside you can even find the movie poster to the movies Serendipity. This time around visiting I took time to get some quick pictures of what everyone at my table was having. My cousin got a burger and some fries and I decided to share meals with my boyfriend and sister. I chose sweet potatoes fries, chicken Alfredo pasta and a BBQ chicken pizza on a flatbread. The sweet potatoes friends were delicious but I was not a fan of the dipping sauce they had along with it. The dipping sauce was chipotle with melted marshmallow, honestly all you can taste is the marshmallow and that I wasn't into much. I have to be honest and tell you that I cannot tell you how that burger taste because it was my cousins but I CAN Tell you that he did finish it all. The pasta was really good I love that the noodles were covered in sauce and that there were big pieces of chicken and broccoli. After a couple bites though, it became very heavy for me to handle and I got full to quick. Also, I didn't have the pizza but the last time I was there I had the same kind and it was great as well.\n\nI always leave happy, full and sad only because I get so full that I can't try the famous frozen hot chocolate. Maybe on my next trip? What do you think."

The veggie burger completely fell apart and had a bland taste, the meatball pizza was ok but hardly any meat on it. The waiter never refilled our water and he hardly came by our table. We even saw two groups of people get up and walk out because of lack of service. All together it was an experience but not one I wish to repeat.

Knowing how good the original is I couldn't wait to take them there for dessert. It held their end as being stellar in amazing desserts. We liked it so much that we came back for dinner and dessert a second time while we were in Vegas and yes they have a nice menu. My only complaint and why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because they have two entrances/exists to the restaurant. If you are seated by the either one prepared to be freezing you know what off. It seems worse with the doors opening and closing. The second time we went we had the pleasure of experiencing it. The hostesses who pulling tables and chairs together for a party of 8, kept going in and out of the door - bringing in chairs and tables from the outside area, then the party didn't show up and they began their slow process once more. It was annoying and one of the hostesses was downright rude. So in that case, if you are visiting during the not so warm months - try to get a table in the middle away from the two entrances/exists. Other than that - game on."

Too bad I can't remember our server's name, otherwise I would totally recommend him! \n\nThe food was actually pretty damn good. I would recommend the grilled cheese with tomato basil soup and the crab cake sandwich. Those were the winners at our table. My dad had a steak sandwich which he really enjoyed except he said it needed some kind of sauce. You can't have a steak sandwich with no horseradish sauce! All they had in their kitchen was A1, so that was a bit disappointing but he did say the meat was cooked perfectly and very tender. The desserts were epic, of course, and we could only eat about a fourth of the portions (out of the five of us, we ordered 4 desserts). BUT, they were all delicious so I would definitely come back here JUST for the world famous desserts. \n\nI gave three stars because of the seemingly shoddy service that we, luckily, weren't apart of and also because they really need better ventilation inside.

Little did we know what we had in store for us.  The frozen hot chocolate was a treat, especially with the almonds.  A rich, sweet and satisfying drink.\n\nHowever the real page turner was when the cheesecake came out.  As the cheesecake approached us - 3 jaws dropped.  I thought to myself - are you sure that's for me and not that table of 10 across the way?  This thing could have been its own cake!  \n\nBecause of its massiveness, I was afraid this hunk of cake would suffer the restaurant chain rule and be either (1) yucky/inedible or (2) generic tasting.  I was actually wrong.  The cake wasn't too sweet, not too creamy or gelatinous, but simple and most importantly, it didn't taste like it came from the freezer section at Costco.  Score!  I gave it my best shot, along with my 2 other dining companions, and at most we got through half of it.  I would definitely eat their desserts here again but next time bring more people!"

No fresh tomatoes and only about 10 measly shreds of basil. \n\nWe also ordered the frozen hot chocolate for 2 at $14. Tasted like a plain chocolate shake... I enjoyed it  but it wasn't anything new. I also could have finished the whole thing by myself. I walked away from this place hungry and disappointed :("

It's a long ways from the Serendipity in NYC.\n\nWhile the inside is cute in some ways and what you come to expect from a traditional ice cream parlor, it seriously lacks ambiance. It is just a little too bright, a little too sparse, not quite clean enough, way too busy, and too many screaming children.\n\nThe wait here can be insanely ridiculous at times. And the wait isn't really worth it. Come back when it's not so busy.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to dine outside. While service always seems to be slower outside, it is good people-watching and just a better experience overall.\n\nThe food is good. I've never had anything bad. I've also never had anything crave-worthy or exceptional.\n\nOne of the best things here is the wings. Definitely one of the better places in Vegas for hot wings. Very meaty and good quality wings. Lots of sauce with just the right thickness and spice (sauce has a hint of cinnamon too). Excellent blue cheese sauce for dipping.\n\nThe hot dog, mac 'n' cheese, etc. are all good. Again, never had anything bad. But none of it really stands out either. And while one could justify the prices because the portions are huge, it still just all seems way over-priced.\n\nThey have a great list of sundaes and other desserts. And all have been good. But there's nothing great about any of them. The ice cream isn't anything great, their hot fudge sauce isn't anything different from anywhere else, etc.\n\nSkip the cocktails. While they mostly all sound good, none of them are actually good.\n\nMediocre. Everything is just fine, but nothing is great. That specialness and uniqueness and sense of magic that you experience at Serendipity in NYC just isn't here in Serendipity Vegas."

They don't take reservations, which is kind of annoying, but oh well, plenty of people watching to entertain you while you wait...\n\nI have been twice, (sit on the balcony for people watching!)\n\nFor the first time: we got just dessert. We ordered 2 sundaes for 6 people and there were still left overs!! We had the fried Oreo sundae (which i have no recollection of) and another called \"can't say no sundae,\" not my favorite because of my disliking for peanut butter. \n\nSecond time: appetizers, drinks, and dessert. Macaroni and cheese, artichoke dip, and WAFFLE FRIES. These were all good, but nothing extraordinary... Drinks: peanut butter frozen hot chocolate (again, peanut butter mixed with dessert isn't my fave) and a Pina Colada because they were out of some root-beer drink that is supposed to be tasty. For the finale, it was a banana split that was equally huge as it was cliche. \n\nGood place to come for fun and groups. You will spend some extra for food that is average, but it's Vegas baby!!"

However, since most of it was left after we were finished the waitress decided to take it off our tab.  That was considerate.  \n\nThe wait is pretty insane though.  And, I wish they would just serve desserts instead of a full menu.  They do have this neat \"text you when your table is ready\" though.  However, after a 45 minute wait or so is it really worth it?

The nachos had about 30 peices of chips with a spoonful of cheese and beans. I literally wasted half of the nachos because they just didn't have any cheese on them. The spudniks were ok. They can compare to Jack in the box cheddar potato wedges. And the other sundaes aren't worth describing. Everything here was just decent. It wasn't worth the 1 hour wait at all.

And no other food items, unless you do the to go order outside. Another thing was this place was totally empty on one side (few people sitting) but they make you wait for like 20-30 minutes! There wasn't anybody in the restro! \n\nFood was okay although I've been here for dessert and it's definitely better than their mediocre food. And service. Service was extremely weird. Like our server was sooo very attentive in the beginning when we didn't need her. We didn't even have a bite of our food when she'll come around and ask how was everything. Then when we needed a box and the check she was no where to be found. Actually we saw her checking out her nails and tried to wave her down. It was so hard to get her around when we needed her. \n\nFor reals, this isn't like the real serendipity. Don't bother or waste your time in the restaurant. The to go line and food looked better and easier. Also be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for a breakfast."

            "review": "Since moving to Vegas, I tend to avoid the \"tourist\" places but of course when my sister came to visit, she wanted to venture to all places I didn't.  I agreed and we ended up at Serendipity.  I am always willing to try a new restaurant, especially when they have frozen hot chocolates.  \n\nWhen we arrived, we fought the line to get our name on the waiting list for a late lunch.  We only had to wait about 15 minutes before being seated.  There were large groups all around us and I was actually surprised at how small this location is.  We were greeted pretty quickly and our server returned with our drinks.  She took the time to go over a few popular menu items but had to excuse herself to larger tables that were calling her.  We decided what we wanted to eat and had to wait a few minutes before our server returned to get our order.  But because we were sitting at a table beside the window/door we were able to people watch.  \n\nConsidering the amount of people in the restaurant, we didn't have to wait very long for our food to arrive.  Of course, I ordered the Ultimate BLT which looked mouth watering!!  My sister had some type of chicken ciabatta sandwich.  We split the sandwiches so we could try a little of both.  I have to admit that thought the BLT was tasty, it was a little dry.  I'm not sure if it is supposed to come with sauce, but mine did not.  I was still overall pleased with the size and taste of my BLT.  The chicken sandwich did NOT disappoint.  Probably one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while.  Nothing about that sandwich was disappointing!!  \n\nWe decided to finish off our meal with a frozen hot chocolate.  How could you come to Serendipity and not have one of these??  It was definitely a great treat to end our meal but not the over the top taste that I had built myself up for.  \n\nOverall, I will probably visit again but my expectations have changed.  Great location, fun atmosphere, friendly staff, good food and tasty desserts.  Serendipity's would have received 5 stars from me if the tables were a little bigger, prices were lower and if they would have threw some mayo or honey mustard on my ultimate BLT."

Man, I was wrong. Food servings here are heaping. Get a sandwich and it's literally 1.5 feet long. The mac and cheese my friend had was thick and creamy...yum. But my absolute favorite of this restaurant was the Frozen Hot Chocolate. Yeah, I know I called them crappy 2 sentences ago---but that was New York's Serendipity: It's just a watered down Frosty. -- But the LV location has different variations of the Frozen Hot Chocolate -- we got the Oreo one with Almond slivers....omg delicious.

Hot chocolate that's frozen and served with whipped cream on top. It might not be worth the $11, but then again you are in Vegas and nothing is cheap. Just relax and pay the price. It's worth it when you're craving something cold and sweet on a hot day. I've also tried the jalape\u00f1o bacon pretzel. It was huge, but it didn't taste that great.

            "review": "I went here with 9 other people for Memorial Day weekend.  I've been to the NY one which I absolutely loved and was really excited to know that there's a Serendipity much closer to me now.  First thing I noticed was that they have a window by the side of the building from which you can order to go.  I found it really interesting and convenient that they did that.  Although there were long lines, they seemed to be moving rather quickly.\n\nI have to say though, I was really disappointed by my experience with the Vegas Serendipity.  Their service sucks.  When I went to get a table, they told me the wait would be about an hour.  That's understandable and fine.  After 50 minutes of waiting, my friend suggested that we check to see how far along we were.  We go up to the bitchy hostess and she informed us that they had called us.  But our beeper never rang!  And we were waiting right outside their door the whole time.  Another server then explained to us that some of their beepers were broken and said that they'd clear a table for us immediately.  Which was nice except the extra little comment she had to add which was \"You guys are lucky we'll clear a table for you now\".  My friend and I just looked at each other astonished.  WTF?!  The beeper issue is not our problem, it's the restaurant's.  They shouldn't be so cheap and use beepers that are broken.\n\nStill, we didn't let that damper our mood.  We went on our merry ways and ordered a load of food.  (Their menu, compared to the NY branch, is not as long and may differ a bit)  I shared an omelette with a friend and ordered the Forbidden Broadway Sundae for myself.  \n\nThe omelette was plain but decent.  Nothing worth talking about.  The sweet potatoe fries that came with it were really good but not so much after you take it home as leftovers.  When our waiter was taking down our orders, he had made it a point to ask me whether I had wanted my dessert after or with my entree to which I replied after since I didn't want to the ice cream to melt.  For some reason, my dessert was brought out with my entree.  When I told the guy that brought it out, he proceeded to give me attitude and told me \"Well it's already here.  If I were to bring it back, it'll take another 20 minutes.  But I mean... I could bring it back if you really want.\"  I told him it was ok and he just rushed off.  No apology, no empathy, nothing.  Whatever.  I had a great dessert piled with whip cream that I had asked to be left out.  Oh well.  What could I have done at that point?\n\nOverall, it wasn't worth it.  The food for the most part is mediocre (my friend told me the One-Eyed Jack was bad and that the bread was so hard it was inedible) and the prices are high.  If you want to go just to say you went, then go.  Otherwise, avoid it.  There are a bunch of great buffets (Wynn!) you can hit up in Vegas."

The pizza was also good but there wasn't anything special about it.  Prices are a bit high but it's Vegas so who cares if you pay $11 bucks for a dessert drink.  I would return here for their Frozen Hot Chocolate only if I fail at my near-future attempt at mimicking their Frozen Hot Chocolate.

Still just a weird drink to me, but tasty nonetheless. \n\nLet's just say we waited so long for our wagyu sliders, it was just getting awkward. For how empty it was, you would think you'd get an appetizer quicker than we actually did. By the time we got our sliders, they were cold and just not good. The first one i bit into was burnt and had a weird taste to the bun. All 3 were extremely dry that you couldn't even tell it was wagyu. We couldnt even finish half and there were only 3 tiny sliders. It was just too sad. \n\nWaiting for our waitress to bring us our check and then bring us our change topped off the experience, making it overall awful. \n\nWe waited so long, we started to take notice of other diners and you would think we all just experienced a national tragedy. Long, awkward waiting time for simple menu items that can't even be cooked right consumed us and we left depressed in a city where we should be UP. \n\nManagement needs to step in and do something."

My husband and I valeted the car at Caesar's Palace and walked to Serendipity 3 with our four children. \n\nI stood in a short line to put our name on a waiting list. The lady told me it would be about 30 minutes. It didn't seem like a long time to wait at first. Then we noticed that everyone in front of us had been seated immediately. Then everyone behind us started to be seated. I asked the hostess if maybe they overlooked us. She said that there was another large party of five ahead of us then we were next. Large party of five? Since when is that large?\n\nI looked in the restaurant to see mostly four tops. I noticed about 5 more four tops were seated before us. That's when I asked to speak with a manager. I asked him why all these four tops were seated ahead of us. He said there were only a few tables that accommodated more than four. It was against company policy to move tables around due to fire hazards. What??? I've never heard something so ridiculous before. They then told us our table was almost ready. I wanted to leave, but I knew I would have to wait everywhere so we waited ten more minutes then we were seated. Btw...the day before 17 of us were seated together at The Sugar Factory in less time!\n\nThe food: way over priced, like most things on the strip. My macaroni was ok but $15 for a 8 oz bowl! My daughter loved the sliders. The meatball pizza was interestingly good. Another daughter had the kids macaroni which wasn't the best but was bigger than mine. My third daughter had cheesy eggs which were full of cheese and pretty yummy. My baby boy shared with all of us. \n\nDessert: the Frozen Mint Hot Chocolate was pretty extraordinary however!  It was $14 since I got the drink for two. We also ordered a chocolate milkshake and a strawberry milkshake. They were good, but I've had the same milkshake for less than half the $10 we paid. \n\nThe redeeming qualities: our server was good, they offered a kids menu to sort of soften the blow of the bill, and the valet was free!"

Delicious strip steak, on crusty garlic bread, thick crispy bacon, cheese, and to finish it off, three over-easy eggs, dripping and oozing their amazing sauce all over the sandwich. You will want to share this with someone, or three. I ate mine with a fork and I am not ashamed. Even the waitress winked knowingly when we said we were sharing. It was awesome!"

When my wife and I talked about it afterwards we wondered if our waiter even put our money in the register or if he was just keeping it since there was no printed proof given to us that he did or not.

If there's one thing that totally irks me it's when customers aren't acknowledged, a simple \"I'll be with you in a second\" would have done wonders. I started to assume we just were suppose to seat ourselves after awhile. When the hostess finally got off the phone do you think we got a \"sorry for the wait\"? Nope she asked how many and someone else took is to our seats...I don't even remember her making eye contact with us to be honest. Who ever the hostess was on Sunday November 20th at around 3 , idk if you were having a bad day but you're a HOSTESS so HOST!\nOn to the food...ridiculously mediocre.

We ordered the fried oreos which comes with about 6 pieces of deep fried oreos, vanilla and cookies n cream ice cream, whipped cream, chocoate and a cherry on top. I'm not a huge fan of oreos but my friends said it was reallly gooood!! i enjoyed the just the ice cream. I'm not sure where they get their ice cream from but their vanilla ice cream was AMAZING! i would be satisfied with just getting a regular chocolate sundae from this place! but the dessert portions are HUGE!! \n\nWe also ordered their famous frozen hot chocolate. This thing was HUGE!! Definately enough for 3 people to finish. It was very sweet. maybe a little too sweeet. More on the icy side than the creamy side though. My friends enjoyed the fried oreos and ice cream better than the frozen hot chocolate. I enjoyd both but im just a huge chocolate fan so im a bit biased (:  I would DEFINATELY come back here for some more dessert!! \n\nThe inside is very cute. Guys testosterone levels might go down just a tad bit tho (;  haha..its very girly inside but like i said, cute. They have a little souvenir stand where you can buy shirts and accessories too. \n\nI had a great time here! i'm definately stopping by here everytime i take a trip over to vegas! hopefully i'll be able to try the food here next time too. The chicken wings loooked reallly goood! wasn't all covered with sauce. I'm excited to go and try it (:\n\nBut if youre looking for a cool place to visit and craving some dessert in vegas, try out serendipty.

We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated inside (30 mins or longer for outside seating), but it wasn't too bad of a wait. The decorations inside were really pretty and very colorful (a little different from the one in NYC). We all shared plates because they were too big for us: chicken pasta alfredo with foccacia bread, thai beef salad, chicken fingers, and a huge omelet with sweet potato fries. \n\nThe pasta was a little heavy but delicious! It was a perfect meal for after clubbing. I enjoyed the thai beef salad because there were a variety of different flavors that blended perfectly. There were also different textures (bits of crispy noodles, coconut shaving, and tender beef) that were a great mix together. \n\nTo top off the night, we shared the frrrozen hot chocolate. It hit our chocolate craving spot so we loved it. Since it was our friend's birthday, we told our wonderful waitress and she and her other coworkers sang to our friend and brought out another frozen hot chocolate. \n\nThe service was pretty good, especially since there were a lot of people there. We didn't wait 30 minutes for our food (I don't know how long we waited but it seemed as though it was only for 10 minutes)."

I ordered the steak sandwich topped with eggs, bacon, and cheese. Yes, it sounds over the top like all things Vegas, but it was delicious. It's an open faced sandwich. It was like eating steak and eggs but with more bread. However, that was not the best dish in the house. My friend ordered a steak sandwich as well, but it was topped with lump crab, asparagus, and a velvety hollandaise sauce instead. I ordered a good dish, but this one better. I was jealous after she was kind enough to offer me a bite. If I were her, I would have pretended it was not good and ate it all for myself.

I was hoping that after the long wait, at least our food would be good, but it seemed like it had just been sitting out forever. \n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate: \nMy best advice would be to skip their frozen hot chocolate and instead, go to Godiva and get their frozen Dark Chocolate Decadence shake. It tastes better and costs less than half the price. We got the frozen hot chocolate to go because we wanted to get out of the place. The frozen hot chocolate is good, but definitely not worth $11. Each of us took a few sips and that was all we needed before throwing it away. And trust me, it was not because we were full. \n\nThis was the closest I have ever come to walking out of a restaurant. Our server, Robert or something like that, was probably one of the worst servers I have ever had. My entire family works or has worked in the restaurant/service industry so we usually give servers the benefit of the doubt, but this guy was unacceptable even to our standards. He gave us a bunch of attitude and was not attentive at all. At one point, it was taking so long for our food to come out that my mom asked him to cancel our order. But he told us, \"Oh, but it's right there, I can see it\". I had a direct view of the kitchen and there was nothing on the counter... but we decided to be nice and say ok. Fast forward 15 minutes later... still no food. He intentionally avoided our table during that entire time and was not apologetic at all. I think he may have said sorry once but it was the least genuine and most condescending \"sorry\" I have ever heard. \n\nTo end on a happy note, the decor is really cute.

Yes the dining seemed all white, pink, and cutesy, but to me it just felt another big name restaurant with too much to offer at a high price.  Service was good, which pretty much guaranteed a second star.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n~ Double Frrrozen Hot Chocolate for two ($18):  Yes, eighteen bucks!  Meh, a lot for whipped cream and coffee beans.  It was good, but personally too sweet to me.  Nothing spectacular as advertised.\n~ Deep Fried Twinkie Sundae ($16):  Now this was heavenly!  The ice cream and crunchiness of that twinkie, mmm mmm mmm!  You've got to try it for yourself.  Okay share it, because you won't finish it alone.  But still, ice cream and twinkies... eh!\n~ Triple Decker Grilled Cheese ($19):  Toasty, buttery, and a cheese lover's dream!  One bite into this and you'll feel the fat go straight to your butt.  Well, for men, it'll be your gut.  But $19 for cheese and bread, ha!  They could at least put tuna in it.  Or maybe they have a tuna melt that I'm unaware of.  \n~ Ahi Tuna Salad ($23):  My friend had this.  She loved it, but bit her lip not once but twice while eating it.  I guess that's what happens with you eat something healthy here.  \n\nAnyways, I'll probably give this place a second chance, but not anytime soon.

Deep Fried Oreos and Ice Cream... but this isnt your average fried oreo obsession... no sir... it is covered in what looks (and tastes) like corn flakes!!! it adds a crunch to the dessert that is simply amazing!\n\nI will come back over and over when i come to Vegas - but just for Dessert :)"

We happened to be in Vegas this past weekend and we happened to see it while we were driving.  We had to stop by.  We had an appointment to have a late lunch with his family, so we didn't order any food, however, everyone's food looked so good.  I decided on ordering their Signature Frozen Hot chocolate.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's not as rich as I thought it was going to be, and it's actually very refreshing, especially made just right for that Las Vegas weather.  The size for one is actually perfect for two.  The price was okay and the server we had was nice.  They weren't too personable though.  I'm not sure if had to do with them being so busy.  I tried to buy some souvenirs and they seemed very confused up front.  Also, when my boyfriend tried to ask them some questions, they seemed sort of stand-offish, which was not very cool.  I'll right up another review when we actually go back to eat some of their food.  Hopefully some of the help up front wont have the same attitude."

I called and had to leave a voicemail but never received a return phone call so we went to the restaurant and the wait was an hour for 15 people.  Since we were in a hurry, decided to order our food to go and sit on the outside tables to eat.  The hostess said they do not take to go orders.  Then we decided to order food from the outside part of Serendipity, it's called something like \"quick bite and run\".  We had 15 girls with us, it was a challenge in itself to get everyone's order and have one person go up to the window to order.  Came up to the window and started reading off our order.  The employee said \"we only serve pastries and drinks until noon\".  No where on the signs or menu did it indicate serving times.  She recommended we order to go from the restaurant since they have a more extensive menu.  I told her we asked the hostess and were told to go is not offered.  She said to go back and ask another person.  By this time, believe it or not, it was 50 min later and our table was ready so we decided to dine at the restaurant.  The hostess showed us to the table.  We had to add 2 more chairs so were rearranging chairs when the server walks up and said \"Whoa, is this your table? Who said this was your table?\"  When we told him the hostess, he said \"Are you sure?\"  Very rude.  I think his name was Ryan.  The food:  I ordered chicken and waffles.  The waffles were crispy and hard, the chicken was over cooked.  And at $4 a cup, the orange juice was not even freshly squeezed!!!!  I was so pumped  to eat here and it was a total disappointment.  Poor customer service and horrible food."

The food was not good.  Not good is an understatement.  My Flintstone size ribs were dry and lacked any flavor of BBQ sauce.  I had to ask for an additional side and that wasn't good either.  I would have preferred Heinz in a cup.  I barely touched anything, but the cole slaw.  The beef in the sliders were overcooked and dry.  The frozen hot chocolate was enormous.  I took one sip but that's about all I could tolerate.  \n\nNo restroom in the restaurant.  You have to walk outside and down a ways to the left under the stairs where you will find restrooms that are equivalent to a rest stop bathroom.\n\nPositive:  Cool menu and cool space.

SOOOO big and stuffed with all different kinds of ingredients. Even the sides were pretty good. \n\nFor the drinks, we tried the oreo frozen hot chocolate and the regular frozen hot chocolate. The oreo one was alright, but I really liked the regular chocolate. It had more flavor in my opinion because the oreo one tasted kinda watered down with too much ice. It's like $14 or $15 for a size for two and like $10 or something for a size for one, so it's pretty much a way better deal to just get the bigger size.\n\nThe desserts looked REALLY good, especially the sundaes!!

You can either order it to go outside at their window or dine inside. The wait wasn't as bad as expected, only about 10 minutes.\n\nThe interior decor was very interesting. Mostly pink and white. They had painted clocks that were all showing as 3:00. At first I started to flip out because I thought they were real. I coulda sworn we got there around 12! Anyway, their menus are freaking huge. You'd have to be as blind as a bat to not be able to read it.\n\nBetween me and my friend, we ordered the frozen hot chocolate and the pizza with spinach and mushroom toppings. They have special pizzas like the mac and cheese, but if you're not into that stuff, you can make your own at an additional $1 for each topping. After waiting for what felt like an eternity, our food came out. My friends were getting annoyed because the food took ages to come out and when you have 6 hungover and starving ladies, time is money!\n\nI couldn't even begin to describe how excited I was to try their infamous frozen hot chocolate. It was the first thing that came out, and I immediately latched my mouth onto my straw. Utter disappointment! It reminded me of a frappuccino from Starbucks! It wasn't bad or nasty, but it definitely wasn't living up to it's hype. It was topped with whipped cream and sprinkled with milk and white chocolate shavings. I'm not sure what the big deal is. It was literally like a blended chocolate milk!\n\nTheir pizza, however, was a lot better. The crust was light, thin, and soft. I easily folded it so that I could stuff as much as I could in my mouth. It was served on a wooden platter which was probably what it was baked on. The pizza was light but filling. I walked out completely satisfied. \n\nI'm not sure what the hype is all about, but I'm curious to see how the NY location will turn out. The prices are fair considering how massive the portions are. If you're hungry, try their foot long hot dog. Freaking massive!!"

It was terrible and disappointing.\n\nI don't know if this place once was famous for product quality, but every dish I walked by looked quite unremarkable at best.

It happened so often that trying this thing became an item on my bucket list. Finally ordered the large size for two people to share with my friend. As soon as we took a sip she and I looked at each other right away and made a face. Something was really off in it. There was a strong lingering aftertaste of spoiled milk. I didn't react right away because I wasn't sure if maybe that was an intentional taste although my friend felt the same way. After a few more sips I had to tell the waitress it just wasn't drinkable. She assured me they went through milk so quickly it couldn't be spoiled and offered to have it remade. It made sense that a place like this couldn't serve spoiled milk, so I agreed to try again and have it remade. This time someone who I believe was part of management brought it out. But even after the second time that after taste was still there. I tried to ignore it and tell myself maybe it's just an acquired taste, but it was just not drinkable. We ended up just leaving the thing. $20 down the drain. I know I'm pretty good at detecting bad milk, but I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. But the car ride home confirmed my suspicions when my stomach started cramping. I wish the waitress or management would have tried it to be sure it wasn't spoiled. I know it sounds unlikely for milk to be spoiled but things can happen (bad shipment maybe) and it would have been nice if someone looked into it first or tasted it before dismissing it as something that could never happen. Very disappointing. The money, the time, the expectations... All down the drain. The waitress was otherwise very nice and the nachos were good, thus the extra star. :/"

It took about 2 minutes before they asked us \"2?\" \n\nSat down, ordered our food, server didn't give a shit either. He never once came back to check on us. Actually he was no where to be found, he came out, but didn't stop by our table when we were ready to leave. I had to ask for a togo box from another server. \n\nThe food here, like in New York isn't all that great. Food you can get at TGIFridays or any other joint. Seared Ahi Salad was meh, the seared ahi was completely crusted in sesame/black seeds and it was somewhat disgusting. The salad part was good though, how do you go wrong throwing a bunch of lettuce and toppings on a plate. The Buffalo Chicken Pizza was a little overwhelming. It said that blue cheese crumbles, but it was more like blue cheese glops in a few spots of the pizza. \n\nReally, the only reason to come here are the frozen hot chocolates and because it was in the movie Serendipity and you want to experience that nice romantic moment John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale shared on that cold winter night, well going here is definitely far from that experience."

Came here because most of the buffets in Vegas had already cut off their lines and my friends have been wanting to give it a try. The dining wait was about 45 minutes and by this time, we were all already too hangry to wait so we ordered in the outside togo/patio area instead. \n\nI got myself a bacon cheeseburger and fries. My burger was very bland and had no flavor at all. The meat wasn't even juicy, just dry. :( The fries were mediocre at best. I did try some of my friend's frozen hot chocolate (which is what they're famous for), and it was probably the best thing I had. \n\nProbably best to only grab the frozen hot chocolates here!"

Secondly, when it was finally ready, the kid at the counter called out a frozen Oreo hot chocolate. Normally, I would not say anything, but since I paid $11 for a blended frozen beverage and went out of my way to try this place, I wanted exactly what I ordered. The kid at the counter (who also took my order) then starts arguing with me, claiming I ordered the \"Oreo\". He then proceeded to call the attention of his manager, also a kid, and she also gave me a hard time about my order although she was relying entirely on the kid who took my order. \n\nAll in all, I felt berated and unnecessarily confronted over re-making my drink that probably costs them less than $.50 to produce.

Bright, fun, busy. I am glad I took a twelve-year old because it is also loud and definitely a place for the kiddies. I would have been disappointed if I craved any type of sophistication or intimate dining. My BBQ and Blue cheeseburger was pre-formed patty okay, but not anywhere near worth the $20 price tag. Ava's pulled pork sandwich on a pretzel bun was much better. The $25 desserts are definitely the draw here, and by the looks, a family of four could easily share one. I found myself having order envy as a diner next to me tackled a foot-long hot dog, and some others a tray of tacos. My three main complaints: A floor so dirty, I somewhat lost my appetite; the fries were cold and tasted like they shared the same oil as the fish; and service was choppy. Still, if Ava and a friend wanted dinner before the Five Seconds of Summer concert, I would be inclined to take them here."

I prepaid nearly $600 for an a la carte menu, and signed a contract beforehand with all the T&Cs. While I read this carefully, I didn't think too much of the statement: \"Seating is up to the manager's discretion.\" I should have paid more attention because it was 100F -- even at night -- when we arrived. And my party of 13 was placed on the patio outside in this sweltering heat while the dining room remained half filled. When I requested to be reseated, the management promised me that they'd move us as soon as 5 more seats became available, yet we watched as walk-ups were continually seated instead. \n\nWhile the food was indeed great, it was hard to appreciate as no one was in the mood for eating in that uncomfortable heat. More than half the food and drink ordered went unconsumed. To add insult to injury, someone had the ingenious idea of putting misting fans on the patio to try and cool down the patrons, which just resulted in ruining all 13 girls' hairdos which had been carefully done for the night out.\n\nMaybe it sounds like I'm being finicky, but when you pay this much money for dinner (inclusive of a 21% service charge!!!), you expect things to go right and to be treated as VIP. This was a complete bait and switch."

Do yourself a favor and make a reservation.\n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate is something your should definitely try if you this is your first time here. Its what everyone comes here for. It's essentially a hot chocolate frappacino. I really liked it the first time I tried it.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate is not the only thing they serve, oh no, the actually have a very large menu of other delectable goodies. Our server, Karen mad cool and told us she had tried everything on the menu at least twice and here favorites were the 4 cheese mac & cheese with chicken and japalenos added and the crab cake salad. How could we not take the advice of someone that had tried the gigantic menu more than twice over? \n\n4 Cheese Mac & Cheese + chicken and Japalenos - WOW! Superbly well made Mac & Cheese, but adding the chicken and jalapenos, send it to another level. I dare say its one of the best Mac & Cheeses I have ever had and I get that dish almost everywhere I go.\n\nCrab Cake Salad - Excellent hot crab cakes served of a mixed green salad. The heat from the crab cakes slightly wilts the greens and makes for a very pleasing blend of textures and temperatures.\n\nDeep Fried Oreo Sundae - What! Deep Fried Oreos! In a Sundae! Yes please! I don't think I really have to say any more since these items by themselves would be pretty good. Put them together and you have a winner! Also, another recommendation from Karen. Haha, she is totally awesome! \n\nSince the menu has so much on it, its tough to say anything in general, but if you get what I got, I don't think you will be disappointed."

Picked up a canister of the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate mix to take home, which includes prep. instructions.  Staff member ( can't remember his name) told us to make it into \"double hot chocolate\": combine 2 scoops of choc. ice cream,  2+ Tablespoons (preferrably dark-- Ghiradelli, etc.) chocolate syrup and 1 to 1 1/2 cups ice in blender...good luck!"

Don't order the frozen hot chocolate to go if you're outside because it's not worth it. My girlfriend and I got on the waitlist and saw there was a \"to go\" area outside and by the time we got the frozen hot chocolate we were called to go inside. So what did we do? We ended up ordering another frozen hot chocolate inside so that it was in the glass which is a better experience than a to go cup. The frozen hot chocolate was pretty good. We are such fatties and it was breakfast time too. We also ordered the \"I Thought I Saw a Wabbit\" which has Vanilla & Butter Pecan Ice Cream, Heavenly Carrot Cake, Maple Walnut & White Chocolate Fudge, Topped with Whipped Cream. This was surprisingly good. I wasn't a huge fan of the butter pecan ice cream but the cake was moist and all the toppings and ice cream that went along with it was like a heart attack. The overall menu is extremely pricey. There's some things on there that I would not pay over $15."

What could I say that would make you trust or consider my opinion over others?\n\nWell first of all, I don't really have a big sweet tooth. I always say \"no\" to desserts and I think therefore am fortunate enough to never have braces *knock on wood*. So when I say that the frozen hot chocolate ($9 for the small) was actually pretty good, that must mean it is heaven to those dessert lovers. The chocolate chip flakes were so yummy with the whipped cream and cold \"hot chocolate\" flavor. Here's a pic, which reminds me of how delicious it was: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=_LMf6cTfbNqv6zSn6nUY6g#lbKzskj0SKkZ5Ej18VA6_Q\n\nI also had big expectations for this place given that it's so popular, so giving 4 stars after those expectations mean that they have pretty much met them. The dessert was good, and even \"The 'Hangover'\" omelette I had was delicious. French fries, cheese, and mushrooms in an omelette? Consider my hangover cured!! I added onions which they charged an extra $1.00. I thought even the potato wedges were really good and well seasoned. But one thing I gotta mention... it was HUMONGOUS! I couldn't even finish half. I know I'm a small girl but my guy friend said he couldn't even finish it. This was about $12 so that's pretty good considering the huge portion. Pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=_LMf6cTfbNqv6zSn6nUY6g#FVqYvZZwtpc_O5L7LAsolQ\n\nMy friend had the fried egg benedict, which I didn't really like so much. I thought it had a weird taste, but my friend said it was ok. He thought it was really small at first, given only two pieces: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=_LMf6cTfbNqv6zSn6nUY6g#b4-wUWO8-XQgzuklUl7V3Q. But those biscuits are heavy and sauce is so rich that he got full and couldn't help me finish my giant omelette when he said he would damnit haha. Oh well, had lunch the next day figured out! =P\n\nThe wait was an hour for two people, so I suggest walking to Caesar's Palace and grabbing a Fat Tuesday while you're waiting which was what we did :) \n\nand PS. if you order the frozen hot chocolate with your meals, the dessert comes first. So if you want it later, order it after you get your food! \n\nHope this review was FUC (funny useful and/or cool) to add to the other 1500 reviews ;)"

It's going down, or rather, it went down. \n\nBeing from \"The Bay\" I've had my fair share of Ghirardelli chocolate sundaes in Monterey, CA and at the flagship shop at Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco. For around $9, and rarely a long wait, you can get a killer sundae that's big enough to split. Contrast this with the New York institution that is Serendipity - $14+ for a sundae!!! You've got to be kiddin' me!\n\nAfter eating at Hofbr\u00e4uhaus last night, my sister and I headed on over to Serendipity 3 for my birthday dessert. Somehow it took nearly an hour to get over to S3, but once we got to the building, we were able to walk right in and get seated. \n\nI'm too cool and too poor to pay $10-$15 for powdered milk and cocoa power blended with ice (Frozen Hot Chocolate.) Forget about it! I chose the $14 Strawberry Fields Sundae. Seriously, strawberry ice cream PLUS cheesecake - PSSSSH, as if there was another option out there for me to chose! Granted, I've always been the girl to choose gummy worms and jolly ranchers over chocolate and would never try to rip somebody's eyes out for a Hershey's bar during \"that time of the month.\" \n\nWe waited a good 20 minutes for the sundae to arrive. Just as I was telling my sister that \"this was the kind of stuff that makes me rate a place 2 stars\" our waiter waltzed in with this HUGE strawberry sundae - definitely enough for at least four people to share. We had a TON left over to take home. \n\nThe sundae was divine but the long wait time, coupled with the ridiculous prices (seriously, +$1 for sprinkles?!)  makes for a 2 star experience. This sundae could EASILY be recreated at home with a slice of NY cheesecake from any supermarket, a pint of strawberry H\u00e4agen-Dazs and a ton of strawberry sauce and whipped cream for a mere fraction of the cost of this sundae. \n\nThere is no way that this would be an affordable place to eat out at if you were #1 not sharing, #2 eating a meal as well as a dessert. I think I'd rather skip the high prices and make a copy-cat at home."

We walked up to the window and we ordered 4 iced hot chocolates and it was exactly as I remember it to be from New York's location. Just not in a cool glass goblet.

Not only did it come out cold, but my friend ordered a rare steak, came out medium well! \nI give it 2 stars because our server was fantastic. He let us know right away that the food would be slow to come out. When we complained about our food he was able to get some of it comped and he brought us free dessert! We all felt really bad for him because he kept apologizing for everything when clearly it was not his fault! \nIf you want a good brunch, skip this place, not worth it."

The frozen hot chocolate was a bit pricey as we got the $15 one for 2 which didn't seem that big to me. The decor was a bit mixed, although I do understand they are going through construction right now. The pizza I ordered was good but nothing to go crazy about. I might come back just for the frozen hot chocolate."

They were lightly battered with tempura and they were moist and came with about 5 dipping sauces.  I had the white pizza - great!  My boyfriend had the bbq cheeseburger - he said it was very good.  So big he couldn't finish, perhaps having the frozen hot chocolate and chicken strips first, filled us.  I would definitely go back for the food, it was delish!

We waited another five minutes and finally went to the window to ask. They'd forgotten to make it.  FAIL. Also, they charge a whole dollar for tap water.

I remember this experience quite vividly because it was one of my more memorable nights in Vegas.\n\nThat same year, I discovered the original Serendipity 3 in NYC and sure, I wasn't head-over-heels crazy about it, but like any other trip, I always try compare and contrast and search for exclusive items. Sadly, there was nothing different--at least on the more affordable side--that reflected Las Vegas' charm.\nSo, it actually took me two tries to finally get something from this location, and it didn't end up as ideal. The first time, they were closing at around 11--I mean, who closes at 11 PM in Vegas?! \n\nI finally got to try this place on New Year's Eve, moments away from their closing, through their take-out station outside. I had a Strawberry Supreme and fries and both were mediocre; the fries were soggy and were almost inedible. I was looking forward to the drink because, let's face it: if you paid $10 for a cup, you better have very high expectations. It was bad. Real bad. It was overly sweet, flavored (it tasted like cheap juice) and blended with milk and cream. The whipped cream did not help, but I give them some props for at least some effort for festivity with the rainbow sprinkles. I'm reading and seeing that it shoud have been a velvety red color--mine looked like a strawberry milkshake, meaning cream was added to it. Still, I felt as if it was rushed since it was one of the very few \"cheaper\" and quick food options on the bustling Strip that night and businesses skyrocketed. It didn't help at all that I was eating and drinking this in 30-degree weather in their outdoor seating. I have only gone back Serendipity 3 once since and I'm not a much of a fan with the drinks.\n\nWow, I can't believe I pulled this from the back of my head like nothing!"

Anyway, I had Serendipity 3 in Las Vegas for brunch this morning and I was definitely not impressed.\n\nFirst of all, the price of everything is ridiculous. Umm $17 for an omelette? Seriously? Granted, yes, when it came out, it was HUGE. Probably 2 meals worth of food. But so extremely pricey for not even being that good. It was nothing special. It did not \"hit the spot\" or anything. My friends ordered sandwiches and salads for lunch and just as the omelette, the portion sizes were incredibly huge (but also pricey).\n\nFor all you out of town folks who've heard about Serendipity, my advice is to visit the location for some frozen hot chocolate or just a sundae (and share it with like 10 of your friends). Their desserts are definitely amazing and beautifully prepared.\n\nIf you're in search of a brunch spot in Vegas after a night of fireball shots (just as I was), don't expect to feel satisfied after Serendipity. Their food isn't that great and paying over $20 (with tax/tip) for a mediocre meal didn't make me feel so great either."

If you have a TotalRewards membership through the Caesar's Palace family you not only get rewards here but also discounts! Only about a dollar or two a plate cheaper but when burgers are $17 and $18 it's worth it! They don't skimp on portions and if you aren't starved I would maybe share an entree. The burgers are to die for! My husband had one with brie on it and he was very impressed. The drinks are crazy expensive, $14 each? Nuts, but a pitcher of beer is only $17 so if you are trying to save money for the slots go that route. The location of Serendipity is perfect if you are seeing \"Absinthe\" which is mere steps outside the restaurant so it worked out for us. Save room for dessert, we tried two different ones during our trip and preferred the Sundae's over the frozen hot chocolate which is really a glorified $11 milkshake...the sundae however was amazing! We got the Broadway one and it said it had 'chocolate cake' in it, what we didn't realize was that it came with a literal piece of chocolate cake on top of the Sundae! No joke! We could barely eat half. We had a great server who was attentive and friendly. We will be visiting Serendipity again next time we are in town for sure!"

Yeah it looks pretty, but way to rip off your customers. Once in a while, OKAY.. but I mean once in a blue moon because the walks ridiculously far unless you're already walking the strip and it's really only enjoyable for dessert.

It was very satisfying for my sweet tooth; however, I think I could've shared it with my sister since it was really big & filling. As for my entree, I ordered the mac & cheese. That was filling as well as the portions are big. Our server was great! Unfortunately, I forgot his name. My only complaint were the hostesses because they were a little rude & unwelcoming."

Comes with side of potatoes which was delicious. Thir frozen hot choclare is yummy :) great to share a size small with the familym ive had their mimosas before. its pretty good. Prices are a bit high however its like that in all places in vegas. \n\nRestaurant sits literally on the strip in front of Cesears Palace. I recommend outdoor sitting If the weather permits. Not too hot or not too cold weather, you should take advantage of the outdoor seating. Its great to people watch and just enjoy the Vegas atmosphere while waiting for your food!\n\nI recommend making reservations because it can get packed! and be on time because they cancel your reservation If you dont show up 10 mins after your reservation time."

It was a warm day outside and I decided that I HAD to try the frozen hot chocolate and fulfill my list of things to do before I left Vegas (trying THIS drink was one of the things on my list). I'm glad I did, because now I know. After reading Yelp reviews about this place, I realized that I did not have time and money to waste to dine in, so I ordered a frozen hot chocolate at their To Go window located in the back (other side not facing the main street). I believe it was  around $8.50 (?) for a regular sized cup that looked like a grande chocolate chip frapp from Starbucks. I'll have to admit that it did taste pretty refreshing and similar to a chocolate frosty from Wendys with whipped cream and chocolate chips like frapps at Starbucks (price difference exerts Vegas lifestyle). I liked it, but would not go out of my way to get this again. At least I left Vegas happy, because I finally tried a frozen hot chocolate that everyone raved about at Serendipity's. \n\nP.S. To Go window does not have as many things that you can order compared to their regular menu, but it's faster if you are on a time crunch."

And I was standing right by the host table and I noticed the two hosts were telling literally every party that the wait is 40 min. Lolol.\n\nMy party and I had been waiting for 40+ minutes. Half the time in the freezing cold outside cuz they told us to wait outside then the other half inside because it was way too cold and wasn't going to stay outside any longer. Then all of a sudden a party of 2 shows up saying they have reservations at 5pm (Note: it was 4pm). The host picks up 2 menu and seats them right away. This was right after i was told id be seated next. Wth?!?  They made reservation for 5pm... not 4pm. Without hesitation the dumb host didn't think to consider the people who had been waiting and just seated those people. So of course I complained to the other host. And she said yeah I just realized that.. I'll tell her. But yeah nothing could be done because they had already seated them. I was hungry, cold, cranky, and not having it.\n\nPlus the food was not worth it and overpriced but it's vegas so it's expected. But just as people expect vegas to be overpriced simply because it's vegas.. we expect the service to be at least decent because it's vegas. You know?\n\nThe only thing I enjoyed was the macchiato  frozen hot chocolate.. \n\nI will never be going there again unless I was craving their frozen hot chocolate and the wait is 10 min max cuz like I said earlier it's not worth it.\n\nTheir management is so unprofessional. The 2 hosts were talking badly about the manager and how he/she comes in whenever he/she wants.. I mean that's your opinion and you have the right to say what you want but c'mon... you have customers.. like 15 of them standing in the front waiting to be seated and you're talking badly about your manager? So unprofessional. Hosts are the face of a restaurant.. the first impression and i have to say they were the worst. \n\nThe server was nice but dumb as well. I noticed total reward members receive discount.. so I asked him if I could just give my total rewards # to be used towards the bill and he said he'll get it from it after the meal when he brings me bill. Well.... yeah its my fault I forgot to mention it or remind him when I received the bill but if he's the one that told me he'll do it after.. thenn shouldn't he be responsible for asking for it again when he gives me the bill? I could've saved around $10 but ... nope. \n\nI would expect more from a restaurant that is associated with Caesars palace."

Second, we had to wait 20 minutes and it wasn't full. The only good thing about that is that they don't give you a pager, they text you. There were numerous tables that we could have sat at and there was a large number of people taking ice cream to go and sitting under the large shade tent that was nearby. I think there is a bit of Studio 54 going on here as evidenced by our experience and the other reviews. It wasn't cute then and it isn't now.\n\nWe did have a bubbly waitress (but she didn't give us our TR discount). I had a classic hot fudge sundae and my sister had the famed Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. I could have made the sundae better at home and that's not something I should be able to say for something I paid $13 (I have the Total Rewards card, which was supposed to give me a  $1 discount, but she didn't apply it although I gave her my card) for. It was vanilla ice cream, fudge, (a LOT of ) whipped cream and chocolate chips (their overuse of whipped cream has been spoken of in other reviews). There was just as much fudge around the base of my glass as there was in it. I am not sure if that was just sloppiness or they thought it was cute. I've had amazing hot fudge sundaes with the same ingredients, so it's all in what you choose. They seem to throw chocolate chips on everything ice cream here as they were on my sisters Frrrozen Chocolate as well. \n\nOn to that. She didn't think it lived up to the hype at all, especially for $13. I didn't taste it. But again, you shouldn't be charging this kind of money for things that are just, \"Meh\". The decor inside is old and needs a rehaul. It's cute when you first walk in (and I LOVE the color pink), but upon closer inspection, it's ratty.\n\nI live half the year in NYC and will try the one there before writing this company off. But this wasn't a good start."

She was a little rushed & not personable.\n\nAlthough I do have to say that the 2 gals I dealt with at the front counter were excellent in getting our party of 5 seated in 5 mins instead of the 30 mins we were told to begin with. At a 114 degree weather today we probably could've gone for inside seating, but THAT probably would have been the 30 min wait. The fan misters were OK if you were directly in its path. \n\nOur drinks came out fairly quick, along with the baby's kid meal which were the 2 burger sliders that could have easily been devoured in one bite by any starved adult--they were so microscopic! I guess perfect for a child of 21 months.\n\nThai Salad was pretty good, the Nachos appetizer @ $14 was shabby, only thing good about it was the condiments it came with:  sour cream, real guacamole & fresh salsa. The Buffalo Wings were nothing special, just your ordinary batch that came with sticks of carrots & celery & ranch dressing.\n\nWhat wowed me was the White Cholocate Frozen Hot Chocolate. I think we got gipped because we ordered a Large to share, but it looked exactly like a Regular single serving of the Oreo Frozen that someone in my party ordered. Banana Split, I was told, was good, along with the Caramel Sundae that someone else got.\n\nAll in all, this is not a place to go if youre Starvin Marvin for food, but I wasn't let down w/my dessert choice since I am a true White Choco lover. They need to re-train staff, but I gave the girl a full tip only because I want to believe she was just tired from the heat & was just probably not having a great day. Whatever. Overpriced. 3 stars because I enjoyed my company."

Upset to say it was ruined by an\nextremely rude server, Izzy. Perhaps it was the fact that I ordered water instead of a drink that it made him think I wasn't a \"worthy\" guest? Or was it also because I requested my dessert first, the cowardly portion($16 versus the $24 for a full-size)? Or, is the initial reason behind your sour attitude towards us because I requested a booth for a party of 2 when you could've been sat a table of 4?\n\nFirst off, I ordered water because I've been walking around Vegas all day in the 106 degree weather. Secondly, I requested my dessert first because I've always wanted to try Serendipity 3 for their sundaes (I wanted to make sure I had room for my dessert over my dinner). When I placed my dessert request, I specifically told him I'm going to order dinner after this. His attitude to that was whatever. I shook it off; I didn't mind his doubt because it does sound like an excuse. That was my first hint. The second hint was when he rudely dropped off my sundae- not one glance at us, i heard the thud on the table, didn't even bother to ask if I was ready to order dinner. Okay, that's fine... Maybe he was busy. Now this is the part that infuriated me: he checked on his other table, cleared their dishes, made sure they didn't need anything else, didn't even bother to stop by, left somewhere, and another server stopped by to announce that she was his \"break\" server. Needless to say, my mood went sour, my appetite was ruined because at this point, it was now obvious he didn't give a sh*t about us.\n\nIt's a very cute sundae parlor atmosphere with friendly servers (e.g. His \"break\" server) which had the potential of a great experience.... I wish I had his \"break\" server or any other server with a better attitude than what Izzy had treated me and my sister just because we had water, sat in his booth, and ordered our dessert first."

My bf and I got the burger & frozen hot chocolate deal for $32. That is pretty pricey but we are in Vegas and nothing is really cheap. Also, the portion size is quite big and I couldn't even finish my burger. I got the avocado club burger I think? It came with fries too but I could only eat half, ate some fries, and finished my frozen hot chocolate. I would just come here for the frozen hot chocolate drink though. There is a to-go option outside next to the restaurant itself."

I will say some of it is a little pricey, but I don't mind paying it. Also, there is ALWAYS a wait here...which is kind of annoying because there are also always empty tables.

It's basically a poorly done chocolate milk shake. All I got was chunks of ice in my milk shake that wasn't blended well and lot of whip with a few speckles of chocolate chips on top. Would I come here again? Probably not. I was sorely disappointed. And someone said it wasn't overly sweet ..... Lies. Although diluted by chunky ice, it still felt sickenly sweet. I guess it's good for people with a major sweet tooth. My waitress also wasn't entirely friendly when all I ordered was the frozen hot chocolate.

They do make an absolutely awesome sundae that is a must treat while in Vegas. however, you can plan on a wait and the service is honestly less than stellar. The prices are a bit over the top - but you come to expect that when you are dining on the strip these days. It's still an experience and if we are on the strip - the kids always want to go.

She took a taste of the peanut butter version, though, and quickly feel in love. How could you not? Chocolatey peanut buttery goodness covered in whipped cream? Yes, please! \n\nWe actually went for breakfast on our last day in town. They were busy, but got steadily more so as we sat there. Our waitress was friendly but distracted; she might have had too many tables to worry about. \n\nI wasn't particularly hungry, but I knew that the portion sizes were large. Knowing, as well, that we'd be in a car for five hours, I decided to order the Fresh Bread Basket, in the hopes that whatever wasn't consumed at the table could be available for munching during the road trip home. My husband ordered the oatmeal and coffee, and my cousin got the Benedict. \n\nI admit to being more than a little disappointed in the bead basket. The items - biscuit, croissant, muffin and cinnamon roll - were anything but fresh. They weren't even warm. The biscuit, which my cousin was raving about (it was the base of her Benedict) was hard and crumbly and ice box cold. Crumbly I can handle. Cold and hard, not so much. I had to wash every bite down with a sip of water. The croissant was the best thing in the basket, and also the smallest, and the last thing I ate there. The muffin, half of the biscuit and cinnamon roll came with us for the trip. The muffin was the only thing consumed at a later date (my breakfast the following morning). The croissant and the muffin were definitely the best things on that plate. \n\nMy husband enjoyed the oatmeal, but thought it was overpriced for what he got. I mean, it was oatmeal, after all, and even an apple crisp garnish can't fancy it up enough to justify the cost. \n\nMy cousin, meanwhile, loved her Benedict. I guess that counts for something. \n\nI'd definitely want to go back, if just for the chocolate alone. I may want to give the food another shot, but it wouldn't be my first dining choice when in Vegas."

They were out of glazed during this visit so we had chocolate.  I don't care for chocolate donuts much but this one was good. $5 ($4 for me since I have a Total Rewards card) but well worth it, which is a surprise since every thing's grossly overpriced on the Strip anyway.  We did a midnight run 2 days later - he had glazed this time. My nephew's motto is \"Donuts make me happy\" -  I had to agree this time.  So if you like donuts - check this place out."

My coffee cup had a VISIBLE hot pink lipstick mark on the cup and thank goodness my friend noticed so we sent it back. The waitress said \"oh\" and took it back and came back within a minute and the mark was clearly rubbed off but still there. I knew she was probably going to spit in my coffee but asked her again to put it in a clean cup. She took a couple minutes this time and the coffee was spilled ALL over the side and still had the mark. Sent it back again and it finally seemed like it was in a clean cup though I'm sure she did something to my coffee. \n\nWould SHE be okay with someone else's disgusting lipstick mark and drinking off of that? I don't understand how Serendipity trains their staff that they don't even provide the basic, elementary service of providing customers with clean mugs. Didn't help that the waitress never cracked a smile, and looked like a coked out ratchet ho who couldn't wait to get off to go back to the streets to feed her nasty habit."

So after lunch at Enoteca, we headed down the strip and went to give this place a shot.\n\nWe grabbed a table outside and went to order our treats from the outside window.

Another couple of friends got one too, and a giant doughnut.\n\nWe got our giant cup of fro-ho-cho and dug in.  Effectively, it's like a milk shake with a slightly grainier texture.

The doughnut looked really good and astonishingly massive, but it was still an average doughnut.\n\nUnfortunately, that's all we really got from Serendipity 3, but here's the limited assessment I can make...\n\nSummary: Lots of treats.  Kind of expensive but large portions/sizes.  Frozen Hot Chocolate (fro-ho-cho, anyone?) is like a milkshake with a little bit of a grainy texture.  Good and sweet but not amazing.  Doughnuts are massive.  No parking other than Caesar's valet to get here, so I recommend walking to it if you are nearby.  Overall, good but need to try more to get a really good perspective."

My bf got the reuben and it was one of the best we've had! The meat is so tender and so delish. I had the high heel pump proscuitto. That too was really fresh and tasteful, serving was huge, so I took the rest to go. We shared a single oreo frozen hott chocolate rather than the one 'for 2' and it was just right! Super sweet, but what dessert isn't? It was good for what it was and I would try it again."

Our bartendar suggested we add Jameson to our Frozen Hot Chocolate. It was surely an alcoholic's delight as the sweet drink hid the bite of the liquor. This drink made my boyfriend buzzed afterwards.

When my family came to Las Vegas last summer we came here three times in the course of a week.  I love all of the sundaes and the deep fried oreos are the bomb diggity.  I'd say if you want to try something besides the frozen hot chocolate get the deep fried oreo sundae.  The frozen hot chocolate is also awesome.  Both times I had it I shared with my boyfriend, but I could've had it all to myself and I'm talking about the double portion.  I'd say it's a little small, but I love shake-like confections.  I think no matter what time I come here I'll always get dessert and not something else, because when I think about Serendipity 3 I think about dessert.  In that respect my review is a little biased for just desserts.  That's all I've had.  I've been trying to coax my university friends to come here instead of going to happy hour. It's that good. :D"

I was like, \"How is anything frozen & hot? Stoooopid.\"  But my friends were soooo excited about it and so I got it.  Dang. They really don't have to bring it out in a salad bowl-sized cup.  I mean, it's good... but not THAT good.  \n\nWhat I would prefer to order is the fried oreo sundae.  It's uber sweet and huge so make sure that you share with other people.  But I'm all about texture, so the crunchy & crispiness of the warm fried oreos accompanied by the cold vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup is a better option than the cold, chocolate slush.\n\nThe only other thing I ordered there were their nachos, which was good, but it's nothing that I'll crave.\n\nWhat they have going for them is their (1) reputation, (2) optimal location: middle of the strip in front of Cesar's palace, (3) the novelty of the restaurant (there being only three other locations), and (4) it's cute and fun diner-like decor.  However, with all the other amazing palaces to eat in Vegas, I'm not sure that Serendipity's would make it on my list of \"must-eats\". \n\nIf it's convenient to drop in and the wait isn't very long, I'd say it's worth a visit...maybe even get something from their to-go window.  BUT if you have to wait for more than 30 minutes, especially in the Vegas heat, then I don't think you'd be missing out if you passed on this place."

When asked which frozen hot chocolate she recommended, her response lacked any interest and service. Not impressed at all.\n\nFood: Ordered the regular frozen hot chocolate. Not a sweet tooth kind of person. So it was a bit overrated in my opinion. Tastes like a melted super rich chocolate malt that you will need to workout for the next 5 days to burn those crazy calories. If you like that sort of dessert, then go for it. \n\nAlso ordered the Thai Beef Salad. DO NOT ORDER THIS. \n\nfor $17 you get the cheap cabbage/lettuce, 4-5 tiny slices of fatty beef, and tons of fried noodles and other colorful garnish on the plate. \n\nMy overall recommendation... is just go get some regular RIte Aid ice cream and take a picture of the place. For the ridiculous cost of the items of the menu and the half decent service.. this place has a lot to learn about maintaining the quality and standards of a notable establishment. Save the extra workout and calories... Overrated."

There's gotta be something unsanitary about that, right? Some sort of health code violation? Not sure how to prevent that, maybe just better cleanup of the food that dumb children (or dumb adults, let's be honest) might have thrown on the ground for them.\n\nAs for the food, it is hard to find anything on the menu under 12 bucks. Even appetizers. I opted for the 16 dollar burger which was cooked exactly the way I wanted it, medium rare (plus!). While both burger and fries were good, they were not worth 16 bucks and were certainly not anything I would rave about. Dessert = also expensive. My boyfriend and I split a simple sundae with butterscotch and hot fudge. Tasty...but not 13-14 dollar tasty.\n\nI don't feel the need to ever come back here, honestly.

With all the fancy desserts to choose from in this town (each one trying to out-do the next), sometimes the simplicity of just good ice cream coupled with quality chocolate, rich whipped cream, and a cherry top, becomes the most attractive and sadly, the hardest to find.  But if that's what your heart is desiring, then look no further because Serendipity 3 is where you need to be. \n\nParking was challenging getting into Caesar's Palace on a Friday night, but I'm glad we didn't give up the fight against a ton of traffic to get to the large lot located at the back of the casino, or working our way back towards the front of the casino to S3 once we parked.\n\nUpon arrival, we were met and seated quickly by a friendly waiter, and our orders were taken within just a few minutes. A short time later, we were pleasantly greeted by his return carrying a large tray of various ice cream dishes, of which mine was the \"Classic Chocolate Sundae.\"  Served in an extra-large sundae cup, this over-the-top, bomb-liciousness of pure ice cream grandeur is something to behold.  Flowing over the rim w/ premium vanilla ice cream drenched in hot fudge, and then finished w/ a mound of perfectly stacked and swirled whipped cream, the visual impact of this sundae suggested that this night was going to end wonderfully.\n\nAnd after polishing it off in entirety, it sure as shit-fire did!  (Lactose intolerant pun intended--that too being serendipitous and worth every cramp thereafter).   Without a doubt, one of the best hot fudge sundaes I've had in a long long time.\n\nWill I be back again?

Were you too intoxicated on arrival to recognize your surroundings?  Of course there's going to be a bit of a line and the prices are a bit high - you're right there on one of the most prime pieces of high traffic real estate in the world!  You pay for what you get sometimes, so come in with the right mind set and you'll be very pleased.  The portions are huge, the whole concept is whimsy and fun, and if you can't eat it all it's okay.  Think of all the buffet food you passed up earlier in the trip and enjoy what you want on your terms.  It's frickin Vegas.  These sundaes are as good as you'll get anywhere, the food is casual, delicious-not-trancendent and exactly what I expected, and to be able to walk right into Absinthe (the best show in LV period) and walk then right into the old school icon that is Caesars Palace all right there - it's perfect.  Get a beer to wash down the chill pill and accept the strip for what it is, and what it isn't.  Viva!"

And that's coming from a former waitress-I know how difficult this job can be.\n\nDespite the fact that the restaurant was not very busy (there were other patrons, but the majority of them already had their food), we still waited 20 minutes for a server to even take our drink orders. When we told him we were also ready to order our food, he said that he did not take dinner requests; he would have to get our waitress. My boyfriend asked if we could tell him what we wanted anyway, and he was nice enough to just say yes and said he'd pass it on to the girl who would wait on us. I thought this was an odd division of labor, and while we were waiting for our food, I noticed that the restaurant seemed to have one person who took food orders, one person who did drinks (and by drinks I mean even bringing you a Pepsi), one person who bussed tables, and one person who actually brought the food over. Yikes.\n\nTen minutes later, the waitress came to the table: they were sorry, but the kitchen had run out of the spaghetti and meatballs my boyfriend had ordered. He changed his order, and we waited another 15 minutes. To make a long story short, after all this, the kid who brought the food out of the kitchen gave our dinner to the wrong table. The chef came out and apologized. He brought us a free dessert, and said he would re-cook the food, but the experience did not improve much despite this. We still had to wait at least another 20 minutes, and our waitress was no more available to us than she had been when we arrived-we barely saw her and ended up having to flag someone else down to ask for our check. \n\nWhat a mess. We weren't the only ones with this issue; the group of ladies behind us also waited a long time for no reason and also received the wrong food. And to add insult to injury, shortly after our food arrived, my boyfriend spotted a family who had sat down after us receiving the spaghetti and meatballs they'd told him they didn't have.\n\nThis might have been just one bad night, but I certainly wouldn't take the chance by coming here again. I don't want my dinner with a side of Trying Not To Get Aggravated."

The only down side is that ordering to go means smaller portion but it's still worth it and I should probably prevent myself from striking diabetus this early on. A little downside is the last time I ordered a frozen hot chocolate, it was a little too chalky to taste. There are a handful of flavors to choose from but I always stick with the original!!\n\nWhat I just recently found out, is if you eat in the food court at Caesar's, the receipt from your food provides you with a BOGO frozen hot chocolate at serendipity!

My friend and I also split a side of fries, which were meh. Average. But who doesn't love french fries?

It's pretty darn cold outside, and lots of the heat lamps were broken.  The lines were crazy long for ordering at the window, too. I think it would've taken just as long to order it from the window versus waiting for a table at the restaurant and getting seated. Service was pretty good here, too...

We went at about 11:00 am and were told that lunch wasn't served until 1:00, which we all found to be a little bit odd. We did decide to stay, though, just so we could try their famed \"frozen hot chocolate.\" We also ordered drinks, as our visit happened to be during the summer and it was extremely hot out. The service was terrible; it took almost an hour for our drinks to be delivered and almost forty-five more minutes for our frozen hot chocolate to arrive. The real kicker was that it wasn't even crowded- there were at least thirty tables open and all of the waitstaff were just standing around talking. As for the frozen hot chocolate, we deemed it sub-par and overpriced. You can get frozen hot chocolate from Dunkin' Donuts that is just as good as or better than Serendipity's for a much more affordable price. Sure, I understand that you're also paying for the atmosphere, but based upon the service and the quality of the food, I don't think my family will be returning to Serendipity 3 any time soon. Overall, this place is overpriced and overhyped. My advice is to skip it!"

So if you're a hungry-beast, don't go here. \n\nNot only that, their service is S-L-O-W. Took at least 20-30 minutes before we got our appetizers and another 20-30 minutes for the main meal.

Crabcake & artichoke dip was so different, yet good, and the beef sliders were quite tasty too.

You have to go the Rewards Center (in the Forum Shops) to redeem the coupon though, but if you have the time, go! It'll save you $11 on a frozen hot chocolate!!!

Frozen hot chocolate came, and it was alright. Not as good as I remember. \nNachos were good, and the portion was huge. Thanks for that, since my Mac & Cheese was so salty I had to send it back. Not before being chastised by the waiter complaining about it. \n\nThis place could be so good with some decent servers and a little updating. The people watching is great, and the location is great, but the experience was terrible."

We made our way through Caesar's Palace and finally made it to serendipity.  The inside was full, and quite frankly, looked uncomfortable, so we decided to go the takeout window instead.  I ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two and almost had a brain aneurysm when I was told my beverage would cost $16 dollars.  I know its vegas but $16 dollars is pretty ridiculous.  After a five minute wait we got the drink and began our trek back to the car.  The drink was plenty big for three people and tasted exactly how you think frozen hot chocolate would.  I can see this being especially good on a hot summer day but unless I was in hell I would never pay $16 for a cool beverage."

There was a bunch of open tables while they were telling people there was a 45 min wait. Thank goodness we had a reservation. Our waiter was honest in telling our visitor that they are not known for food as they are for sweet treats but made his recommendations. What he should've done is tell us to go somewhere else in exchange for his tip upfront for saving us from this disappointment.\n\n2) Food: They ran out of that Las Vegas Strip Steak sandwich. Ummm it's a wknd and they're not adequately stocked with one of their most popular dishes? So that already ticked me off. My second choice was the crab cake sandwich only because it was about half the price of just the jumbo lump crab cake. It was good the first couple bites, but then I guess the grease finally got the best of me. And the high heel pump sandwich was just whatever as well.  \n\n3) Dessert: While the frozen hot chocolate was pretty good, at $10 for a reg sz (compared to just a grande at starbucks) I can never really see making it a point to get again or recommend. Oh and the banana split had soooo much whipped cream, I still could've used all the excess that wasn't eaten as a whipped cream bikini!\n\nIt's great for location and a fun ambiance if you're a girly girl, but for the price and the the wait, go anywhere else."

By the way, you'd want to order the small since the order for 2 is large enough to feed 4 adults unless you want a sugar high.  My recommendation is a 3/5.\n\nThe entrees sampled are the crispy chicken salad and the crab cake sandwiches.  The crispy chicken salad is your regular old green salad with dressing of your choice.  What's different about it is the large fried chicken pieces that comes with it.  If you want to order a salad just to be conservative on the calories, you might want to eat less of the chicken and more of the greens.  Overall, the crispy chicken salad is 3/5 but the chicken gives it a +1 so it turns out to be 4/5.  The crab cake sandwich is just a plain old crab cake sandwich with an inflated price.  That's a 3/5.\n\nOverall, this place is between 3 and 4 stars with more leaning towards 3 stars.  Still, it's a nice place to go for a cold dessert on a hot desert summer day."

We agreed to that! \n\nHe worked with urgency, and even though he was waiting on someone else who arrived before us, he made sure we had enough time to eat. Bam! Nachos with waters came in about 10 minutes... not kidding. When I saw the nachos, I gasped because they were HUGE... easily 3 people can eat off these nachos and still be full. Even though my mother and I were in a hurry... we finished on time all because of Carlos. Yes, this place can be a bit pricey, but I assure you that you should always try to split the food as the portions are huge! \n\nOur nachos came with both meat and chicken meat, which I thought was pretty amazing.

Being the coffee addict that I am, I ordered the frozen mocccchachino hot chocolate and my sister was craving onion rings.  \n\nFrozen mochachino ($11): We ordered the regular size and I must say this was pretty tasty butttt not worth the money.  I feel that I can make a mocha drink, pop it in the freezer, and then take it out and it would taste just the same.  Delicious but way overpriced\n\nOnion rings ($9): these were big FAT onion rings!  I thought these were pretty tasty.  The only way I will eat an onion is if it is fried!!!  They sprinkled some parmesan cheese on it which I thought was kind of odd but I tolerated it by dunking it in ranch and BBQ sauce.\n\nOverall, its a cute place with great service, but the food was just mediocre to me.  I wanted to experience it but this place was just had to much hype.  I MIGHT come back to try their other food items..maybeee....\n\nNOTE:\n-Outdoor/Indoor seating (heaters available outside)\n-Right by Caesars Palace Hotel"

Well the wait wasn't bad at all in the LV location so we decided to go check it out.\n\nI really do not know how this place is getting all the 5 star reviews! The decor fit with pink and white ceilings and oversized lamps somewhat like a venue where you would host a little girl's princess themed birthday party.  We shared a $14 BLT and it had too much mayo but was still BLAND BLAND BLAND. Thumbs down. The \"highlight\" of the meal was their sweet potato fries tossed in a salt and sugar mix which was quite tasty even though it was pretty dry. \n\nExpensive and food is subpar. Sorry, but I'm gonna have to say skip it!"

The place was very hopping and we waited anxiously to order dinner. All of the food looked great coming out of the kitchen and we were starving. After our drink order, we were ready to order the main course. My Wifey and I ordered the ABC burger (Brie, Avocado, and Caramelized onions) with Sweet Potatoes Fries. My son ordered the Big Mac N Cheese with Bacon. There was Loaded Potato Skins and Chicken pizza ordered. All of the food was delicious and they were very large portions.

I had the hangover omelet and was full from only a quarter of the portion.  truly a mix of goodness: fries, cheese, mushrooms, and bacon wrapped in an egg.  genius.  \n\nthe  menu had clever names and a wide variety, so it takes about 10  minutes to read what exactly is in everything.  it's probably good to get an idea before you go.. from what i've read before we went, sometimes service is slow [which i'm assuming is based on how busy it is..] luckily we went on a not so busy day. \n\nhusband had the ahi which was also excellent.  the serving of tuna filled him up, and the plate was majority rice pilaf mixed with sweet onions.  sweet potato fries are also a must try... which is served with most plates.\n\nso getting to the point.. I had a black and white sundae.  half chocolate half vanilla.. whipped cream with white chocolate shavings.. chocolate syrup, and a strawberry tuxedo.. [chocolate made to look like a tux] covered strawberry.. best part.  otherwise, it's a big ass bowl of ice cream.  big deal.  \n\nBUT I also had a bite of the deep fried oreos which was pleasantly not so much oreo-e then I thought. I don't know everything in that.. but the Oreo was dope. \n\nso the main main point.. food food is good.  :) deserts were typical... you can make crazier things at home [which i have] .. or at  yogo bar for cheaper."

We showed up at lunch time and we were lucky since everyone would prefer to sit inside we were seated immediately outside facing the strip.\n\nThe decor is very bright and \"carnival like?\".  Think of an old school soda shop with very bright pink and orange seats.  The seats were comfortable and the environment was very fun.\n\nBefore we could even snuggle into our seats, our server was there with a big smile on his face and a welcoming attitude.  He took our drink orders with enthusiasm and not long afterwards they were in front of us.  The menu is expansive and has so many different food options.  We did not know the history of this restaurant and just ordered what sounded good to us.\n\nWe ordered an Asian Chicken Salad to start with.  They had it split for us in the kitchen without us even asking for that.  The two halves came beautifully plated and tasted even better in our mouth.  The chicken was moist (dry chick pet peeve of mine), flavorful and the salad and dressing delicious.  Even though we shared a salad, we could have been satisfied with that half.  But being us and the need to try other flavors we also ordered entrees.  I was smart and ordered an appetizer as my meal, the Wagyu Beef Sliders.  I made one adjustment and replaced the American cheese with Blue Cheese.  They were delicious, juicy and again too much for me to finish.  Hubby ordered the The One & Only Las Vegas Strip Steak Sandwich.  His plate came out and I couldn't stop laughing.  We needed 3 people just to eat that sandwich.  It was FULL with steak, eggs and just mouth watering ingredients.  As predicted he couldn't finish it, but he wants to go back and not have any starters so he can really make a dent in this sandwich.\n\nWe did not have any room for desserts, so we will have to go back and give them another go just for sweets.  \n\n***Here's a trick for all of you.  If you want to sit on the Strip side and do not mind sitting at a bar.  Go directly to the back bar and take a seat.  It's first come first serve and you do not have to wait to be seated.  They have the same menu and the bartenders and awesome"

They did look good, but that wasn't what I came for. Side note -- We were stuft from our dinner at Carnevino and I skipped their desert menu on purpose so I can go to Serendipity.

One of the places she suggested was Serendipity 3, which is located at Caesars Palace. The New York restaurant is one of my personal bookmarked businesses. Until she mentioned it, I didn't know there was also one in Las Vegas. \n\nSo after I dropped off my luggage at my stay at the Platinum Hotel, which is only a \"long\" block away from Caesars Palace and the lively Las Vegas strip, I was excited and hurried my ass to Serendipity at Caesars Palace. \n\nThe restaurant is cute and crowded, but the bar was empty and had the crazy football game between the Green Bay Packers and Arizona Cardinals showing on their huge television. Looking at the huge menu, the restaurant serves your typical American food. But my main target was definitely-the Frozen Hot Chocolate with chopped peanut butter cups and clouds of whipped cream for $10.00. Since I was at the bar, the popular frozen treat was prepared at the bar and came really fast and presented in front of my face. I was shocked on how my treat was made with the pretty design and the liquid flooded all over my dish. One sip of my first Frozen Hot Chocolate, I was blown-away on how sinful this treat was. I was enjoying my frosty treat while watching the football game and watching the agile waitresses and gifted chefs working hard in the kitchen. \n\nMy treat: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?userid=HYQoxBC1y1DGPq6pGP09Tw\n\nThe treat may contain 10,000 calories, but you'll need it after burning off all those calories walking on the overpass to get across the street and into the next casino\n\nRemember, get the popular frozen treat at the bar. You'll get it quicker. \n\nMy Visa was accepted here and picked the right time of the day to enjoy my treat. Serendipity is the \"Real Deal!\""

The wait was over 30 minutes for a table which I could understand but why wait another 30+ minutes to receive your food?! I'm sorry but that is not acceptable. \n\nI give this place 2 stars only because the waffles we ordered tasted good.  But it could have been because they starved us to death waiting for our food.  At any rate, I would not return here.  The server even gave us an attitude because we made a mistake on how we were splitting our bill within our group.  \n\nI don't understand what all hype is about this place."

That's all I had there so I can't really judge the other stuff, but just based on that, it was alright!  Maybe it was just too hyped up for me.  Or maybe it was due to the fact that I was tired, sticky and sweaty from the Vegas heat, and just kind of exhausted from the day (it was late).  Perhaps the OG New York location would be more exciting... I would try it there.  The atmosphere/ambiance is probably different there."

The decor has been Vegas-ified; it's the cheap knock off version of the real thing. \n\nWe came in right before closing & the wait was only about 10-15 minutes. Our waiter wasn't completely unfriendly but it was obviously the end if a very long, busy shift. \n\nOur order was small & simple but still completely gluttonous:\n--  nachos: a humongous portion of chips (yellow corn & red-colored ones) covered with cheese, beans, tomatoes, onions & chicken. Tasty comfort food, but I can't say I'd ever get it again. We ordered it b/c you have to eat *something* before you can have dessert. \n-- banana split: even shared amongst three people, this was a sickeningly gigantic portion of vanilla, strawberry & chocolate ice cream topped with traditional toppings & 2 bananas. If you don't control yourself, this dessert has the potential to give you a serious tummy ache. \n\nBeen there, ate that. I only needed to experience Sependipity 3 in Vegas once. The food is average, which can be said for the NYC location as well, but at least they've got the ambiance & quirky atmosphere to justify the visit."

But if you love desserts as much as I do, I believe you can finish it all by yourself, like I have ;] \n\n#2: T he Forbidden Broadway sundae: It has a chocolate blackout cake with  Chocolate & Vanilla Ice Cream that includes hot Fudge & whipped cream.  Reason I love this sundae because it has hot fudge. mmmmmhhh.  The chocolate cake is a little too sweet for me, but the vanilla ice cream compliments it very well.  If you love chocolate this would be the one for you. \n\n\nAnother Sundae I have tried is the  Grasshopper Marshmallow Mint Explosion \nWhich includes a mint chocolate chip ice creams with  Marshmallow Sauce & Hot Fudge & it is topped off with whipped cream & chocolate mints.  When I first saw this sundae it looked like grass and I would think it tasted like those wheat-grass shots you would take at a gym or some health store.. With that being said, I liked it but the way they made it was very much like a milkshake for some reason? \n\nOverall, the food there is okay I dont really recommend eating there.  The prices are overprice for the average food they serve.  The serve is a hit or miss and usually you have long wait times to get a seating."

This is the most unfriendly and unprofessional environment!  We heard such great reviews but this ruined the experience, very disappointed! They need to train their hostesses better."

            "review": "Now is it an act of serendipity to find a Serendipity 3 in Vegas? Not particularly since this spot has been open for quite some time in a prime spot right in front of Caesar's Palace. I've been to the original Serendipity 3 on East 60th in New York way before the dawn of Yelp, and more recently, patronized the one at Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach (which appears to have since shuttered). For the longest time, I kept wondering where Serendipity 1 and 2 were but finally realized the 3 refers to a trio of legendary princes from Sri Lanka. Jamie W. and I were just sauntering on the Strip when I cajoled him to come inside for a \"snack\".\n\nIt's quite a cavernous place with \"Happy Birthday\" apparently sung every ten minutes. The pink trim and animated design was befitting for an old-fashioned ice cream parlor which they were attempting to evoke. I already knew what I was getting, but Jamie spent a good amount of time studying the rather comprehensive, text-heavy menu. He settled on the $15 Deep Fried Snickers Sundae, which, you guessed it, contained chunks of deep-fried Snickers nestled between the scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream ladled liberally with hot fudge, caramel and peanut butter sauce. It was topped with peanuts and whipped cream, but they were superfluous to this decadent creation (photo: http://bit.ly/1T9YoB8).\n\nAs tempting as that gloppy mountain of sweetness was, I ordered the $16 Frrrozen Hot Chocolate with Mochaccino and Chocolate Chips. I was asked if I wanted a 'Large', but what that technically meant was a serving for two since there were two straws. It's the classic 'Serendipity 3' order that Marilyn Monroe and Jackie O. loved though probably didn't share at the same time given Jack's open door policy. I had no trouble downing it as it's sweetly tasty with plenty of whipped cream and chips for contrast (photo: http://bit.ly/1poDzWh). We noticed other tables had actual food like club sandwiches and Cobb salads. But not for us when we visit this place. Somebody sing \"Happy Birthday\" to me... even if it isn't my birthday.\n\nCONFECTIONS - 3 stars...monstrous but also pricey and sundaes that are frankly too decadently sweet\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...it's like a Malibu Barbie cafe come to life\nSERVICE - 3 stars...front desk staff was quite terse but the waiter was nice and cheery - even got me a free Diet Pepsi to go when he forgot I ordered one\nTOTAL  - 3 stars...not really serendipity, just a calorific detour on the road to hell"

The reservationist is in a awkward place outside that you would normally walk by. I saw every person walk by her in fact and they walk back outside to get on the wait list.

I understood because not everyone in Vegas wants pot pie in the summer. Still sad.\n\nI do have to say the Mac n cheese and spaghetti are good. I've tried other dishes here and those were the better ones. \n\nNow a days, I skip the meals and dig right into dessert. I really don't know which are my favorites now because my favorite sundaes are now gone. I loved the Strawberry Fields or the Humble Pie sundae. Again, I asked why and they mentioned that they weren't really selling and they like to try new things. I'm really afraid of loving another sundae here because it may disappear. It's like dating men over and over who have intimacy issues. \n\nI come here when guests are in town, so maybe 4-5 times a year. This place has always been a hit with my guests.\n\nSo here is my Serendipity tip: Make reservations especially in the summer. It's the Strip, reservations by phone or Opentable are very helpful."

We were just expecting overpriced, normal sized food. \n\nAll in Nachos: Meh. Nothing special. You should probably ask for the cheese to be a little more melted, otherwise you're not really getting what you're asking for. They served it to us a little cold which made everything taste...not so great.\n\nLV Steak Sandwich: Skip this. It's really not worth it. The \"steak\" is super chewy and tastes extremely bland. They could've at least marinated it or made it a little more tender. Soo disappointed with this dish. It had so much potential.\n\nI think we all know people come here for their frozen hot chocolate. I now know there's a reason for that. Everything else on their menu is just not up to par. Maybe if you're drunk though?"

Well.. after trying it out first hand, I conclude that it was a total waste of my $12 (for just a to go cup size)! It was simply a thick powdery super sweet cold chocolate drink! I rather have a glass of chocolate milk ):\n\nI later found out that this other place called sugar factory also has frozen hot chocolate on their menu- for just $6-7. If any of my friends insist on trying it in the future, I would take them to this place instead. I wonder what big of a diff it will be."

Despite the cold, I slurped every bit of that hot chocolate concoction.  SO SWEET!  My mom suggested fries for a snack bite, and I thought it was an odd combo, but what a great suggestion!

And $1 for a cup of tap water.  Thank you, shall I just leave my wallet here?  Ok.\n\nBut was it good?  Yes, but it was also pretty much on par with an ice-blended drink from Coffee Bean.  So many times we have asked people to describe a Frozen Hot Chocolate and it's always like \"You have to try it to find out\" no, shut up, it's like an ice-blended chocolate shake, stop being all mysterious this isn't a club.\n\nThis is another legacy that is underserving, and the current average review is starting to show that.  \"You just have to go here when you're in Vegas\".  I don't think so.  Also frozen hot chocolate is an oxymoron and you can't convince me that it makes sense.  We cannot have Boiling Ice Cream...because that's just cream, isn't it?\n\nAlso, just a note to Serendipty 3, but your outside window menu lists one of the items as being more expensive for Total Rewards members.

We both ordered pastas and I got the wings for an appetizer. The wings were really good. Flavorful. But both of our pastas were more on the bland side and had no taste really. My boyfriend kept putting salt and crushed red pepper but it just didn't do any justice. His brother and his girlfriend shared a pizza and nachos. The pizza came out and they forgot to put chicken on it. So they had to wait a good 15 minutes to even eat the pizza because it didn't come out until then. The nachos only had a bunch of stuff on one side and didn't have enough meat. It was basically more chips and just a little bit of toppings. \n\nThe dessert on the other hand was amazing! We got two sundaes fit for the four of us. Huge and yummy. I couldn't decide because there were so many choices. \n\nThe waiter was nice and always refilled our water.

Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is a must-have though - but again, it's meant to be shared.\n\nFor their savory items, I've tried their Ahi Tuna Salad (wishing it had negative calories to lower my caloric intake from the hot chocolate!

I was severely disappointed in my experience.\nFirst, the atmosphere is not the same, although there is still that whimsical feel it just felt off for some reason. \nSecondly, the frrrozen hot chocolate here is a poor, poor copy of the one you would get in New York. We got the mint frrozen hot chocolate for 2 and the size, although still big, seemed much smaller than the portion at Serendipity NY. But my biggest gripe is that it was lacking the fine ice crystals that I feel make frrrozen hot chocolate so unique. The drink wasn't nearly as cold as it should have been and since it lacked any ice it felt more like a melting chocolate milkshake and felt very rich and heavy as opposed to rich yet still refreshing.\n\nThe menu is also limited so there are some items missing such as the frrozen pink lemonade which is delicious and would be perfect in the Las Vegas heat. If you love Serendipity and find yourself unable to make a visit anytime soon to New York, Serendipity 3 might be a good option but if you've been to the others and are looking for the same experience I think you'll end up disappointed."

You can save $1-$2 on entrees. \n\nIf you have to use the restroom, do it before you go in. It's located outside a little ways away from the restaurant.\n\nI was here in early November around 3pm and there was no wait, no lines, no problems. The service was pleasant and I have no complaints about anything. We did not eat here, so I cannot comment on the food, but we did have two frrrozen hot chocolates. I'd never had one and I was interested to know what all the hype was about. It really does taste like frozen hot chocolate. It's chocolaty, a hint of salt, a lot of crushed ice and yes--it does resemble a Swiss Miss packet covered with a mound of whipped cream, but it's Vegas! Of COURSE it's overpriced! It's on The Strip--what do you expect? But $15 is a totally reasonable price for a large goblet full of frrrozen, chocolatly, creamy goodness (for two)."

            "review": "Quickie: Service is whack. Frozen hot chocolate tastes like a slightly better version of a Wendy's Frosty (perhaps this is because it felt like a thousand degrees in Vegas...). \n\nThree of my friends and I decided to stop by to try the famous frozen hot chocolate on a late Sunday afternoon. I scoped the place out and saw at more than a dozen empty tables. Sweet, the wait was going to be nonexistent....NOT. The wait turned out to be 35-40 minutes. Why they refuse to seat people when they have plenty of open tables is beyond me!  I asked the snooty hostess why this was so and she said that it was the top of the hour so they had to seat everyone who was already on the list...that didn't even make sense. If there are open tables, shouldn't you seat guests?? The hostesses proceeded to seat two other groups before us in a span of 20 minutes...really?!\n\nWhen we were finally shown to one of the many open tables we took a quick glance at the menu and chose the sliders and a regular frozen hot chocolate for two. We closed our menus and waited for our waitress to come around, which probably seemed longer than it actually was due to the heat. She unpleasantly took our order then came out 5 minutes later and abruptly placed dishes on our table without saying a word to us. She must hate her job... \n\nThe sliders were decent and again, the frozen hot chocolate tasted like a frosty. I definitely was not worth $12.  \n\nIf I ever come back I will make a reservation and only to try the other appetizers/omelettes."

The frozen hot cocoa was OK, all it is is hot cocoa mix and crushed ice.

I guess all that's gone downhill now, because he was one of the most disappointed guests at our table.\n\nFood--\nThe food at our table, as described by myself and my friends, ranged all the way from \"Mmmmm!\" to \"I regret wasting an hour of my life waiting for this.\" The people at our table who ordered the strawberry cream waffles, fried eggs benedict, and breakfast quesadilla seemed happy with their meal.\nTwo of us (including myself) ordered The Hangover Omelet. On both dishes, the potatoes were BURNED to a CRISP. AND they weren't even hot!!! I'm talking dry, black, LUKEWARM potatoes. Simply not edible however I tried. The French fries, which were put into the omelet itself, were soggy and rubbery enough to confirm that the dish had been sitting out for a while before being brought to our table.\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered a side of black beans with his dish. The beans came out late, after he asked where they were. And they came out COLD. We notified the server, who then MICROWAVED them. Are you kidding me? We ALWAYS try our best to be good and friendly customers when we go out, but this was beyond disappointing.\nThe only part of the meal that I actually enjoyed was the Caf\u00e9 Serendip. It wasn't bad. I'm starting to think the only thing anyone should order from this place is dessert.\n\nService--\nAfter waiting about 30 minutes to be seated, we had to wait another 15 or so for the attention of a server. After our order was taken, it took yet another 30-45 minutes until we asked where our food was. Our waitress was not friendly and spoke very quietly (which is not good in a relatively loud environment). I can only guess that she was having a bad day.\nThe kicker came when we got the check and saw that the cold beans, which were then microwaved, cost $7. $7 for a little itty bitty 8oz cup of beans that weren't even made properly. In most establishments, staff will at LEAST tell you how much a side dish of something will cost when you order it. On the bright side -- the only reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is that the waitress did offer to take the beans off the check, which we gratefully accepted.\n\nI would not come back here again."

            "review": "So FINALLY I got to eat here and I can give a legitimate review. We mentioned we were Diamond Club members and supposedly our wait was reduced to half the time but we still waited a good 30-40 minutes for our party of 4 to be seated for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Still, I will take that compared to the hour and half plus waits I've seen here in the past. I gotta say being hungry and watching the other parties food come out as we were waiting for a table was a really big tease. \nOf course, I had to try their world famous frozen hot chocolate. It was about 105 outside the day we were there so I was especially looking forward to it. I didn't realize that it came in 2 sizes, one a smaller one seemingly meant for one person and a larger one to be shared with several people. Good to know you don't have to get the gigantic one if you just want to try it. I gotta say my expectations were pretty low on it. I just expected a slightly sweeter than normal frappucino. Perhaps because my expectations were so low, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Sweet chocolaty goodness but doesn't quite cross the threshold of too sweet. I wouldn't say its one my favorite desserts ever but definitely worth trying if you are a chocolate lover like me. \nAs far as the rest of the food, we all had a hard time deciding since everything on the menu sounded really good and looked really good as it was being brought out to the other tables. I was surprised that the menu did look that good since as I had mentioned in a previous review, all I saw people eating before was prepackaged salads. Well that must have been from the takeout menu because the restaurant food looked much more desirable. I ended up getting the summer brie turkey sandwich and everyone else got burgers. I thought my sandwich as well as the accompanying sweet potato fries (again...they are everywhere now!) were really good. But melted brie on almost anything is bound to be good. Everyone was pretty happy with their burgers as well. \nWhy the 3 star rating then? First, the service was pretty bad. Very slow and almost rude at times. Unfortunately, I can't remember any specific incidents but I know all of us were pretty unhappy with the service we received. \nSecond, this spot has arguably the best location on the Vegas strip. Unfortunately, the facilities are not built to accommodate the traffic it receives. The location the way its set up would be prefect if perhaps it was tucked away in the back of a casino. But being right on the center of the strip at one of the busiest hotels- no way! The small and quaint feel as well as the always ridiculous wait just doesn't work for me. It just seems too contrived. Too bad they don't have another more low key location in Vegas. The food was good enough for me to go again. Too  bad the rest of the experience didn't make up for it."

My gfs and I shared the Macaroni and Cheese, the Hangover Omelette and their signature Frozen Hot Chocolate. \n\nDid not like the Mac & Cheese. I think it was because it was WAYYY to cheesy to the point where I can smell the warm cheese which sorta grossed me out. I did like the top of Mac & Cheese though when it first came out!

Let me tell you, it's worth it. Everytime I bring someone here, we won't order anything else. \n\nThey have a full bar inside and they're also known for their mojitos, which are very good. I recommend the blueberry peach mojito!! Be careful though, they tend to use so much mint that it can get stuck in your straw. \n\nThe reason why I did not give this place the full five stars is because the service is a hit or miss.

While this feature is really cool here's where it goes all wrong.  Only one hostess behind the stand [not good]. She's on the phone....there's a long line of people waiting to give their information to her...we walk to the front of the line to claim our much anticipated table.  Guy in line starts yelling out us for cutting the line!!!  So it sure does appear we were doing that, how would he know that the table is on my phone and it's indeed our turn to sit, not a good way to start the meal after long wait time already.\n\nWe sit down. We ask for the Las Vegas Dining Menu.  Which is difft from what's on the site, but OK no biggie.  It also wasn't offered to us???  boooooo   PS- We are spending a fixed cost of $30.12 for lunch that's how this deal works so we aren't expecting to have a 'cheap meal' here.  \n\nThey mess this all up from there on out.  Meals came out before apps, apps came out 1.5 mins before meals, there wasn't enough room on the table, the place is cramped so people keep knocking into our chairs, purses are falling on floor, waitress is blaming kitchen b/c this promo just started [which she thinks we are dumb b/c it hadn't just started], too much food on the table, blah blah blah. This list goes on and on and on.\n\nAppies were fine, nothing exciting.  Tomato & Mozz salad had the blandest dang dressing I've ever tasted and HELLO this type of salad needs kick b/c it's very bland to begin with.  Chicken Sandwich was soggie and the bread was ALL wrong. I dissected it like my science project frog and ate parts of it somehow.  Chicken Salad Sandwich got the 'wouldn't order it again' from my boss.  \n\nThe best part of the meal was ---Ding Ding--Dessert!  it was by and LARGE the best part of our experience. SO, if you eat here [I have pix that I posted] only get dessert.   But if you don't have to eat here HEAD OVER TO SUGAR FACTORY, you'll be happier :)"

I had the chili cheese hot dog which was dry, not juicy at all, barely had any cheese and the bun tasted old. The portions are huge so I recommend sharing to save on costs. The desserts are why this place stays in business. We had the fried Oreo sundae ($15) which can easily be shared by 4 people. Safety in numbers! Spent $85 for 2 people. A hot dog, a burger, lemonade, 1 cocktail and dessert."

She was not friendly nor helpful. (Ex: when we asked if we could get a menu to look over while we waited, she pointed to the wall and said \"this is our menu\").  People that came after us were seated before us and when we finally got a table our waitress was also rude and unfriendly. (Ex: When she brought my friend her tea we commented on how cute the tea pot was and she snapped back \"it's hot, don't touch it!\").  Needless to say we asked for the check shortly after that! For me, the service is just as (if not more) important than the quality of food for a restaurant to be successful. I was so turned off by the staff personal that I wasn't willing to sit through an entire meal. If you do decide to try this place, I hope you have a better experience! ( But if your experience turns south there is a great Italian restaurant in cesars palace called Raos that has great food and staff! (That's were we ended up eating!) Good luck to all!!"

I was given what I now know to be their stock answer...\"about 45 minutes\". \n\nWe decided to order some ice cream at the to-go window and sit outside. The woman at the counter was snippy and rude. When my friend asked if she could get whipped cream on top of her waffle-coned scoop of ice cream, the woman snapped back in a rude way, \"no\".  How about just putting some whipped cream on top and charging us an extra buck and a half and call it a day instead of being rude about it.\n\nAfter ordering I went to the pick-up window to get our stuff. The simple order for four people was screwed up and I had to wait more than ten minutes to get my scoop of ice cream in a cup. Of course my friends were pretty much done with theirs, so I was even more annoyed. \n\nHonestly I think this place is highly overrated and the staff were rude.

We got the mac & cheese with chicken, as well as the steak. The mac & cheese had a mixture of cheese, which just didn't smell very pleasant and so I couldn't get through much of it. I'm a big smell person so stinky cheese just doesn't do it for me. The steak was very fatty and you couldn't get through a bite without having to pull some fat and grizzle out of your mouth. Thankfully we got an appetizer, the nachos, which were decent, otherwise we would have walked out hungry with an $97 bill just for two lunches. Way overpriced for the quality... Also, just to mention, the bathrooms are located outside of the restaurant, kind of around the corner. It seemed to be more of a \"Strip\" community bathroom, and was the equivalent of a bathroom you might find at a park and smelled like a porta potty. I recommend that this place get an indoor bathroom of their own as my trip to the bathroom to wash my hands before my meal might have been what set off my disappointment with this place as it was pretty gross. I will say, that although I did not get any desserts, they did look pretty amazing. We just didn't want to add another $20 for a dessert to our bill when we didn't know for sure if it was going to be."

So my rating is more like a 4.5 because the ice cream absolutely out weights the service.\n\nDish: Audrey's can't say no sundae\nI loved this combo of ice cream! the coffee was not TOO coffee tasting and sweet enough to my likely. The vanilla was creamy and tasteful, not airy at all! They gave just the right amount of toppings and banana as well.

The Chorizo quiche was delicious. The greens are fresh and evenly dressed lightly. The quiche was perfectly baked. Eggs were fluffy and the crust was flakey. The chorizo can use a little more 'chorizo' flavor. The highlight of our breakfast was the Frozen White Hot Chocolate. So delicious!!!"

I had the Central Park Omelette, which is an egg white omelette with spinach, avocado, and swiss cheese. It was really boring and flavorless. I thought it'd be good because I usually love everything that was in it. But..fail. If I ever come back again, it would only be for the dessert."

            "review": "As a newcomer in the US, the size of dishes keep surprising me wherever I go. I try to follow my Mediterrenean diet but it backlashes quiet frequently. Seems like one country's Tortilla Espa\u00f1ola is another country's monster-sized Spanish omlette stuffed with veggy accompanied by sour cream n salsa with couple of Texas toasts on the sides. I'm not saying the food is not delicious. Quite often they are. Yet bigger is not always the better. \n\nThen you go to Serendipity... All the notions of healthy eating fade away.  Next thing I know I was tucked into the 'Forbidden Broadway Sundae' which is a MOUNTAINOUS chocolate blackout cake topped with chocolate vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, and hot fudge goodness embedded in the core. \n\nEating dessert to me is what it means to shopping to most of the women. And I can affirm that each ingredient was carefully made and each were at the right consistency. Very very very DELICIOUS. But still it wasn't until I found serendipity when the hot chocolate fudge started leaking out from where it was hidden.  \n\nThe size of the desert was so BIG that my boyfriend lifted it up to see if it measures up to his head in size. I haven't eaten burgers, salads etc. but I saw on the other tables people eating and those dishes do not fall short of the desserts.  A portion of anything is definitely for 2 people.Whoever says the opposite, not true. Otherwise the half will get wasted just like lot of ppl did at the restaurant we saw.  \n\nOn the other hand, if you have a big mouth and stomach for food then go ahead!! But make sure you save a room for dessert. In fact, ''Life is Uncertain, Eat Dessert First''. (That would be a perfect motto for Serendipity)"

Yes, it's a little bit pricey... but it is everything a Yelper would love! It's a COOL spot and it is FUN!\n\nSerendipity 3 is strip side with a large outdoor patio (stripside), a small interior dining room, and little walk-up window for to-go orders. The place is spacious and clean. The portion sizes are large and good for sharing (which I recommend).\n\nNow, let's get down to business... And by business I mean FROZZZEN HOT CHOCOLATE. Yum! My favorite is the Peanutbutter Frozzzen Hot Chocolate and it's garnished with mini Reeses! \n\nMy favorite burger is the ABC Burger (Avacado, Brie, and Caramalized onions). It's such a tasty burger topping trio (say that 3 times fast). My sister is a fan of their Ruben, even declaring that it has some of the best corned beef, ever, on it. Sandwiches and burgers are accompined by choice of traditional or sweet potato fries.\n\nThere are some pretty stellar desserts. Sundaes, cakes, and shakes! I have always been too full to try some. I may just have to plan a dessert trip before my next outing to Caesars.\n\nSerendipity 3 is like a really nice McDonald's. It's hip, it's fun, and it's tasty. Great for a quick bite or a refuel while galavanting around The Strip.\n\nTo be noted: The walkup window serves all varities of the tasty FROZZZEN HOT CHOCOLATE, sandwichs, hot dogs, salads, and a few other items.So in case you don't have time to dine in you can pick up some Serendipity 3 while you're on the move.\n\nOn hot Vegas days and nights, FROZZZEN HOT CHOCOLATE is a delectable way to cool down."

I couldn't decide what to eat first, nothing spoke to me. I wanted veggies - so I  went for a salad. The Thai Beef Salad was refreshing and had a cute presentation, must of been the coconut half that served as a garnish. It was smokin' spicy - the chef went overboard on the thai chili, but overall it was good. There was more beef in the salad that I was able to consume. Hubby ordered clam chowder, he said it was average. \n\nNow for the main event - the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate hit the spot. It was rich and chocolatey. The ice or sugar flakes, whatever the heck it was took a while to get used to, but overall we enjoyed. The brother was out in Vegas last week....so we asked him to pick up a packet for us. So we are going to try and make our own at home.\n\nService was so-so, for being as busy as it was our server was waaaay overperky and checked up on us several times. When in Vegas - there are so many options to get your grub on, so I'll pass on the entrees and stick with dessert."

With all the hype surrounding it  I thought they might have used some crazy liquid nitrogen machine to give it some crazy textures and bring out different flavors in the chocolate.\n\nNo, it's just a very sweet milkshake which is dressed up with whip cream and chocolate shavings. It tastes good, very sweet and basically is what you expect after reading the ingredients and the preparation process.\n\nI'd give it a 2.5 after all is said and done, and bump it to a 3 for location. Caesar's palace can be quite the adventure, I'm glad Serendipity is right int he front and easy to find."

I ordered the French toast with berries, bacon and egg.  The French toast was burnt, but everything else was good.  The berries were fresh, the bacon was almost strangely good, the breakfast potatoes were a little oily but had a good flavor, and the egg was fine.

            "review": "Let me preface the following review by saying that if I didn't absolutely have a terrible experience, I wouldn't have said anything.  This review is also concerning their window ONLY.  I really wanted to go to their restaurant the next time we go to New York, but if this window is a representation of Serendipity 3's brand and values, I am NEVER eating their food again. \n\nOur experience at the window was THAT bad!\n\nWe were only in Las Vegas for one day and wanted to do all the fun stuff instead of gambling.  I had always wanted to go to Serendipity 3 but we just never got around to it during other trips so we decided to try it.  I was really, REALLY excited about the frozen hot chocolate because I had heard about it so many times from people like Whoopie Goldberg, Jessica Simpson and of course from the movie Serendipity.\n\nHere is my warning to you, head it if you will: DO NOT ORDER FROM THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD EXPERIENCE!!  I say this after an hour of waiting in their line for below average food.  There was a long wait for the restaurant so silly us thought the window would be faster.  We stood in that line for an HOUR and then once we ordered our food, it took us 20 minutes to actually get a very simple order, which was a chili cheese hot dog, fries and 2 frozen hot chocolates.  Apparently, there was only 2 people working the window for a line of about 50 people.  One girl, who I actually need to commend for keeping her cool.  She was very nice and it didn't seem like the pressure was stressing her out.  The cook on the other hand, was a complete jerk.  It seemed like he was just hanging out back there, not concerned about the line or even caring that people get their food in a timely manner.  He even took off for 20 minutes which is why it took our food so long to actually get to us.  When he came back, he took a sip of his drink and ate some chili, COMPLETELY unconcerned that he had a job to do and maybe needed to do it quite urgently.  Perhaps these are the wrong employees to be working this window.  I suggest getting maybe 4 people who have a deep sense of urgency.  These two lackluster employees are not going to cut it.  I could hear people crumbling behind us about how long the wait was and why were simple orders taking so long.  I felt inclined to get out of the line a few times and didn't because of what I thought I was getting, which was SUPPOSED to be an amazing meal and the rumored delicious frozen hot chocolate.\n\nThis did not happen.  The food arrived to us cold.  This is because nothing is fresh in this poor excuse for a kitchen.  Everything is just sitting there.  The chili was cold (and too sweet by the way,) the cheese was half frozen and not melted, which means the chili wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese, the wiener was overcooked but cold on the inside and the bun wasn't toasted, the fries were soggy and cold, and the frozen hot chocolates, ohhh.....\n\nThe frozen hot chocolates were a HUGE disappointment!  The drink itself was pre-made and had been sitting on the counters the whole time we were in line because I could see inside the window.  The whipped cream was good and I guess the drink tasted ok but it was warm because it had been sitting there and it was melted.  The actual idea of the \"frozen hot chocolate\" is just ridiculous.  It's basically a glorified shake.  I THOUGHT it was hot chocolate with a scoop of ice cream in it! THAT would have been MUCH better!  Instead, I got a watered down shake I could have gotten at Baskin Robbins.  I don't really like Baskin Robbins but in this case, it would have been WAY better than what we were served.  It would have been fresh too.\n\nThe prices are also really outrageous.  $12 for a glorified shake?!?!  After an hour and 20 minutes, we were able to sit down.  The food was completely inedible.  My husband, who normally keeps his cool and tells me to let things go, was outraged.  This coming from a guy who will eat ANYTHING!  We discussed how we would handle this and the possible ramifications and decided that we NEEDED to say something. \n\nI went to the restaurant and asked for the manager and saw that the inside of the restaurant was WAY better than the window.  It was like a completely different restaurant.  The manager came out and was really helpful.  I told her of our experience and dissatisfaction and let her know that I normally wouldn't ask for a refund because it's more about letting them know so they can improve but our experience was so negative that I was demanding a refund at this point.  She was very nice and said she completely agreed and rushed to get me a refund.  That made the situation slightly better and I appreciate that there are at least people in the main restaurant that know what good customer service is.\n\nI am really sad that this experience has tainted my want to try this restaurant again.  Even if I go to New York.  Stay away from the window in Las Vegas and I am sure that their food is actually good."

I didn't really see why since there were 3-4 open tables and maybe 2 parties waiting to be seated.\n\nThe waitress didn't even bother helping us move our drinks to the other table, not that I couldn't pick up my cup and move it, but they had already brought plates and utensils out.

The most important thing that you should know is that the Double Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is soooo much better than the regular one, so please order accordingly.  Only the Vegas location has this.   It's a few dollars more but after all the effort you've put into getting there (to Serendipity AND to Vegas) I think you'd deserve it! \n\nIt's heaven in an overflowing glass, and so good that when the waiter isn't looking you will surreptitiously take your straw from the glass and stick it into the plate to suck up the overflow.  Don't worry, everyone does it. The main difference between the regular one and the Double is the much more chocolate-y taste in the Double, I think it even has dark chocolate in it. \n\nThe Broadway Sundae is also a must-try, it's the most decadent sundae I've ever had and almost better than the Double Frrrozen Hot Chocolate!  So delicious, we actually considered going back for more the very next day.   Thank God I'm a local.   \n\nThe easiest and quickest  way to get there is just to leave your car with the valet at Caesar's, since the restaurant is right on the strip in front of the hotel.  Otherwise you can walk, and by walk I mean hike, from either Caesar's parking lot at the other end of the hotel, or Bellagio's across from Caesar's.  Wait time for a table is usually 20 to 40 minutes."

I had been to this location once before about 3 months ago and it was a decent experience: nothing outstanding or overwhelming. The frozen hot chocolates are a great novelty to try, but it's heavy even for someone with a sweet tooth like me. \n\nFast forward to Labor Day Monday, 9/1/2014. My boyfriend and I checked in at the hostess stand and then waited 15 minutes for our table. It all went downhill after we were seated. After being seated for about 5-7 minutes, we looked around to see if there was a server around our area - our table and the table next to us seemed to be the only ones without a server coming around. After we'd hit that 10 minute mark, I managed to flag down a server walking by and asked her if she was the server for our table. She said no and pointed at another woman who she thought was serving our section, and she proceeded to go over and ask her to come over. I saw the other woman shake her head and continue with her business. \n\nThe server I talked to then came over and reluctantly said she'll be taking our orders now if we're ready. (No apology for the wait - it may not have been her fault, but the gesture would have been nice.) I appreciate that she was going to be serving us, but she seemed like we had totally ruined her afternoon and it just became more of an unpleasant experience. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and she had her own assigned tables to take care of - but if she didn't want to help us, she could have found a manager or talked to the hostess about who the proper server should have been.\n\nThe waters and food came out at appropriate wait times. The Meat Madness Pizza was extremely salty and my boyfriend found it inedible after eating 1/3 of it. I got the alfredo with chicken, it was edible but for the price I had expected better flavor. Portion was large and I didn't finish more than half. The garlic bread that came with the dish was hard and the spread was rubbery. \n\nBy the time we stopped eating our food, we were no longer in the mood to order a frozen hot chocolate. We got our check, mentioned to our server that the food wasn't great and she sorta gave us a nervous smile and walked away. \n\nI'm not sure where the mis-communication happened with our table and the server assignment, but I kind of wish I had gotten up and left when the idea was on the table. The frozen hot chocolate was good when I had it, but I won't be returning to this establishment again unless someone dragged me here."

And although there were awesome finds on the menu, there were a few disppointments as well. \n\nWhat you can definitely tell from their menu is that Serendipity 3 aims to please.  Their options for food and beverages are deliberately decadent, pushing the limits of comfort food beyond counting calories into a happy place close to Willy Wonka's chocolate river.  The place also envelopes you in a quirky pink atmosphere.\n\nWe had the $30 jumbo lump crab entree for appetizers, and though steep, was worth every dollar.  Huge chunks of (what tasted like fresh) crab in a good mustard seed sauce.  The onion rings were huge (and that's about it), I've had better, way better.  The ahi tuna salad would've really rocked if the ahi was larger and of better quality.  The ABC burger with brie cheese, avocado and caramelized onions seemed so great in theory, and I don't know if we just received a bad execution.  The burger was dry, inspite of the luscious toppings.  \n\nAnd finally, the frozen hot chocolate came to our table. My eyes and my mouth were drooling.  I closed my eyes as I took my first sip and... and it tastes like a regular chocolate milkshake.  Sigh, the pitfalls of having high expectations.  I dunno, I was expecting something more.. frozen? More chocolate goodness? But what I had was a melted version of a milkshake.. that came in a larger, prettier package.\n\nSo all in all, we enjoyed and perhaps this review really suffered from high expectations.  Oh, and the fact that they didn't have rest room in the restaurant.  My husband said he had to share the public toilet with some bums shaving their beards.  Will we go back?  Maybe when we're really parched and in the mood for crab cakes.  I'll invest  my $12 in other chocolate milkshakes.  Or a martini."

I took a few sips, didn't think it was worth the calories, so I just threw it in the trash. I was sad. Wasted drink. I'll know better next time."

I'd thought I'd yelp it anyway to help with the ambiance because you may have visions of the new york serendipity as shown in movies, reality shows, etc.\nAfter getting into Vegas- I had to hit up this place. It was 9pm or so and really was in the mood for one thing that's shareable and not a drink. \n\nWe got the Forbidden Broadway Sundae which consisted of chocolate Blackout cake, ice cream, hot fudge topped with whipped cream. The cake was really thick- like brick thick and I think I needed more vanilla ice cream. If I just go by she said, my mom, sister and nieces had lunch there and shared a mac and cheese, blt, and frozen hot chocolate and thought the servings were HUGE. No kids menu so share.  My sister felt the water was g-ross.\n\nAs far as service- our little waitress girl was attentive enough, though I heard a table yell for her a few times. We were served by someone else and we had no napkins which gets gooey after awhile. \n\nI'll go back for the frozen hot choc.\n\nAlso- there is a window outside where you can order and eat out...but in the heat- eat/drink fast before your ice cream melts. And...kinda weird seeing pre-clubbers in mini-dresses down tons of food....but hey they can work it out."

Though they were ecstatic to be out of the sun and to drink something cold that isn't soda, water, or frozen daiquiris, I wasn't impress at all. The drink was presented in a glass crystal-like cup topped off with a huge dollop of whipped cream. The frozen hot chocolate was basically ice blended together with hot coco mix, milk, sugar, and shaved chocolate; nothing special at all. \n\nIt's a small place, yet people go crazy over a poorly executed concept, which is a lost to me. Another commercially gimmick for wandering tourists who want relief from the Las Vegas heat, I won't be returning any time soon."

We had a party of 8 the first time and the interior is brightly decorated with a lot of pink.\n\nWe were seated and then proceeded to order drinks.  We came around noon so they still had the breakfast menu.  It goes until 2pm.  Anyhow, some of the people in my party ordered a few alcoholic drinks which they seemed to enjoy.  The real winner was the food.  The orders I remember were the steak sandwich and the waffles topped with all sorts of berries.  \n\nThe steak sandwich wasn't of the greatest quality but none the less, the size and presentation was impressive.  The bread was a little hard and hard to bite and hurt the roof of my mouth a little.  It also came with egg, bacon and of course, the steak.  All in all, it was an enjoyable and tasty dish which was big enough to feed at least two people.  That's not even including the french fries that came with it. \n\nI also ordered waffles with berries on top along with caramel and whipped cream i believe.   As for that, they were decent waffles.  Not the best I've had, but similar to the steak sandwich, they were of large quantity.\n\nService was great.  Our waitress was very polite, had a great sense of humor, and very prompt.  I think her name was Candace.\n\nAs for my second experience, it was pretty lousy in comparison.  3 of my friends and I went to the to-go window and ordered a few frozen drinks, hot dogs, and nachos.  We ordered the chili cheese hot dog, hot dog with sour kraut, frozen hot chocolate, and a berry smoothie.  The hot dogs were very disappointing because both the quality and the presentation were not to the level of what we'd expect.  I'd rather go to Pink's Hot Dog stand which had a more delicious hot dog at a lower price.  The smoothie I had tasted fine but didn't justify the $10 price that came with it.  \n\nAnyhow, if you go here, don't expect the best quality food.  Expect decent food with a large quantity.  Avoid the to-go window at all costs.  Its not worth the price in my opinion."

It was packed, but we were seated almost immediately during each visit. Their food is less than average, but I've concluded a lot of places in Vegas are overhyped. \n\nI had a burger and it was wayyy too big. I tried squishing it down, cutting pieces out of it, eating it without the bun. Whatever I tried to deconstruct it, I just ended up eating the fries until I was full. The flavor was average for the burger. My friend got a salad and it was a hefty sized salad, but she said it was just whatever and she's had better.\n\nNow to the best part, the dessert! The Mint Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is one of my favorites! I visit in the summer and it's so refreshing. I tried a couple of the drugstore sundaes as well. My favorite would be the Red Velvet Sundae. The Deep Fried Oreos & Ice Cream Sundae was good as well, but not great. The Oreos are uniquely battered and coated with cornflakes. It did offer a crunch, but that wasn't really something that was appealing. For me, I wasn't a fan of this. I'm more use to the simple pancake battered fried Oreos. Definitely plan on sharing. \n\nThe staff here is extremely nice. Even though they might seem a little rushed, it's just because of the crowd. Once it starts calming down, everyone is really nice and just wants you to have a good experience."

You can always to-go your stuff at the window next door, but my friends have told me the frozen hot chocolate tastes better ordering it in the restaurant.\n\nEverything seems to be in big portions here & the HUGE menu (literally) is cute.\n\nFrozen hot chocolate for 2 - For my first visit my bf & I shared this. It was DELICIOUS! I was really mind blown that it wasn't overly sweet. The drink does is supposed to be 17 oz when you order the \"for 2 size\" the for 1 is 10 oz. I think it's cheaper to order frozen hot choco for 1 b/c the rest of the 5 oz in the for 2 seemed like it was just extra whipped cream. I love the chocolate shavings topped on the drink. It's fun to scoop and sip at the same time. Definite must try! Hard to describe the consistency, but it's icy and not too thick (for those that think it's a milkshake)\n\nHangover omelette - This is the perfect omelette that sounds delicious when you have a hangover so the name suits the food. Bacon, fries, mushrooms, and cheese inside an omelette yumm. My friend ordered this and it looked really good, I took a bite and it was a great combo of all the ingredients.\n\nCrab Cake Sandwich - I got this protein style. The nice crab cakes are wrapped in soft butter lettuce. I liked the crab cakes, it wasn't too oily and stuffed with a good amount of crab.The beefsteak tomatoes, bacon, and spinach accompanied the sandwich well. \n\nMint frozen hot chocolate - On my recent vegas trip 10/18/13, we decided to order this 'cause I'm a big mint chip ice cream fan. My bf & I agreed this was a lot better than their original frozen hot chocolate and usually he's not a big fan of mint chip. Basically it's their original frozen hot chocolate, but they blend it w/ a scoop of mint ice cream! I guess it sort of tasted like the Andes mint candy\n\nMake sure you get a total rewards card at one of the casinos (Caesar, PH) so that you can get the total rewards discount pricing on the food & Points! A lot of the reviews here say the service isn't good, but we've always had great friendly service the past couple times we've been here. Food comes out pretty quick. One day I hope I hit the jackpot to try the Golden Opulence Sundae here ($1000 sundae!?)\n\nBTW if it's your first time I suggest you check around what other tables are ordering to see what you'd like. I saw a couple of tables get the can't say no sundae and other sundaes that looked sooo good!!! Will be back to try their other menu items. I swear you can get fat just looking with your eyes"

I'm usually not a fan of ice cream, but Serendipity's sundaes got me hooked! I definitely left the place feeling a few pounds heavier, but it was well worth the price.\n\nMy friends and I ventured to Vegas and decided to come here since it was 100+ degrees outside. We ordered:\n\nFrrrozen Hot Chocolate (~$10): Awesome. It really does taste like hot chocolate, albeit cold. This is probably the best dessert to get if you're really watching your budget but still want a taste of Serendipity's goodness. My friends finished this super quick, and they don't normally have sweet tooths.\n\nAudrey's \"Can't Say No\" Sundae (~$14): Oh, my gosh. I think I had a heart attack while eating this since there was so much sweetness, but it was super tasty! It includes humble pie with peanut butter cream on graham cracker crust. I tried super hard to finish this, but the sizes for all the sundaes are gigantic. It's got enough ice cream to feed 3 people, but you may not want to share after having a bite.\n\nStrawberry Fields Sundae (~$14): Wow, I don't think any other strawberry dessert I've had hits the spot as much as this one. The cheesecake definitely compliments the strawberry ice cream, and overall it just works. Definitely flavorful and a great option if you like fruity flavors.\n\nBlack and White Sundae (~$14): Chocolate and vanilla ice cream with whipped cream, topped with a tuxedo chocolate-covered strawberry. Super delicious, too. The flavors are basic, but it's a great classical twist nonetheless!\n\nI can understand why people would complain about the price, but this place is the home of the freaking $1000 dessert! Why expect anything less than expensive from here? Plus, it's on The Strip! It's a well-known fact that restaurants in Vegas, let alone on The Strip, are pretty costly.\n\nAnyways, I will definitely come here again when I'm in Vegas. But, if you plan on eating sundaes, be sure to have a group of hungry people to share it with! Trust me, there's enough for everyone."

I rolled up for one thing, THE WORLD FAMOUS FRRRROZEN Hot Chocolate. So after paying $10 for this magical drink I was unpleasantly surprised with some bullshit powdery tasting milkshake with a half pound of whipped cream on top. Now mind you the whipped cream and chocolate shavings on top are the best part and taste great. The chocolate part not so much.....you can literally taste the powder in every sip and its quite off putting. Three sips and into the garbage can you go!

It's almost always a dessert trip here so I don't have any advice on the food.  I did have the Fried Oreo Cookie Sundae which is just about one of the best dessert's I've eaten from a restaurant.  They don't do the classic County Fair fried oreo... Here they \"bread it\" with Corn Flakes and when it melts the ice cream a little... its like dunking your oreo cookie in milk when you are eating it together with the ice cream.  \n\nMy wife has always been a fan of the frooozen hot chocolate and now they have many different flavors.  I think we ended up with the classic one for everyone to try.  We had gotten the apple cobbler ala mode also to share with the group and it was a pleasant change to the other dishes being that it didn't feel like a complete sugar overload.  The apples had a perfect tart contrast with the cobbler and ice cream and it created a nice addition to the mix.\n\nI'm a fan... are you?"

One original and one cookies and cream. The original was good! Everyone says it is a chocolate milkshake but I beg to differ. It has a totally different texture and it is perfectly sweetened. As for the cookies and creams one it was good, but I would rather just stick to the original and not worth the additional $2 or so. \n\nService was a little slow and it was really hard to get all the waitresses attention. However, they were all very nice and were very good when asked to refill our water and taking orders. \n\nFinal Verdict: The wait is long but I have waited longer for other restaurants, and this is the only serendipity in the west coast so I would come back to get me a cup/bowl of chocolate goodness. As a person who isn't too fond of chocolate that is saying a lot."

However, they do offer the option of ordering at the to-go window if you're fine with enjoying your dessert al fresco!\n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate [$10]\n\nOver the years, I've been dulled to all that is the frozen hot chocolate. Overrated and overpriced in my opinion, this features chilled \"hot\" chocolate. You can essentially taste the texture from the crystallized sugar from the hot chocolate packet mix, with a huge dollop of whipped cream on top.\n\nRed Velvet Sundae [$12 / $10 Total Rewards]\n\nIf you have your Caesars Palace Total Rewards card, there are quite a few offerings that offer bargain prices. The red velvet sundae offers rich red velvet cake with a great cream cheese frosting, paired with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge.\n\nDeep Fried Oreos & Ice Cream [$12 / $10 Total Rewards] \n\nIf you're looking for a gut bomb, check out the deep fried oreos, which had a crisp surrounding batter, revealing gooey Oreos within. The vanilla ice cream was a nice cooling base for each bite. \n\nSo if you're looking for sweet treats, I'd personally recommend skipping the frozen hot chocolate and trying out the other options on Serendipity's dessert menu."

Who are you kidding? Extremely dry chicken dijon pizza for $14? Don't even think about it...you're better off buying frozen pizza and sticking it in the oven yourself. \n\nLike I said, people come here for the experience and for that, it gets 3 stars! There's just something so 'cool' about the ambiance. It makes us ladies feel special! :)"

Me and hubby shared the footlong chili cheese dog, steak fries, and Mac and cheese. The dog was huge! I feel like it was more like 18' plus 1 1/4 inches in diameter. But at $16, it better be! It was served on a full baguette in lieu of a bun. The chili was a bit sweet and there was shredded cheddar sprinkled on top. I thought more cheese was in order; plus I would have like it melted and not as an afterthought garnish. The steak fries were surprisingly good. The Mac and cheese was delectable. Truffley and cheesy yum. $14. \n\nWarning: they charge you for sharing but you get an additional side. So, not a bad way to go. Portions are large. \n\n6 of us shared one \"can't so no sundae.\" Even with 6 people,  no contest. It was man vs. food and food won! The sundae was incredibly rich and sweet. Legit fudge and whipped cream. \n\nFood was good.  No dissapointments there. Just be prepared to pay for the brand and location, location, location."

He looked like he wanted to say more to us as he was very upset but then he walked away. Then we finally hot the bill!!!!!!!!! So overpriced for horrible tasting food!!!! Even drinks were $5 each.  We started to settled up the bill and my friend took out her Rewards card and it was denied!!!! Really--we were told the bill was already complete and they would add the points but not take off the 10%!!! By then it was after midnight and thus manager just wanted us out---wrong move Shawn!!!!  My friend and I  got our 10% off and he cont to have smart ass comments for us.\nI told him thanks for ruining m sons Birthday and he said --\" like I ruined it,\".

For my most recent visit to Vegas, Serendipity was most definitely in my radar.\n\nWe landed at 9:15 PM and we rushed to Caesar's Palace with one mission in mind: Frrrozen Hot Chocolate should be the first thing to touch our lips in Las Vegas. 9:50 PM and we were there, the restaurant was already closing down so we ran to their takeout window. Perhaps sensing my desperation, the manager was kind enough to give our party The Paddle. He who holds the paddle is the last customer of the day and gets a free Frrrozen Hot Chocolate! Our responsibility was to tell people who would come after us that they should not bother and we get a free drink. Free dessert with a side of bossing strangers around with a license? Sounds like a great deal to me!\n\nWe got the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, Oreo Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, and the White Chocolate Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. While all are delicious, the original one was the best. We also got a giant doughnut that is as big as my head for $5.

We decided to grab our lunch at serendipity3 while visiting the various hotels in Las Vegas. We wanted to sit in the sheltered outdoor area and so we ordered our food as take-outs. There was a huge menu placed directly beside the store and it is intuitive for new customers like me to look at the menu. However when it was my turn to order, I was told by the lady at the cashier in a very harsh tone that that was not the menu and I MUST order from the menu as shown above the store.  I menu placed beside the store was only applicable if you are dining in the restaurant. I was extremely unhappy with the tone of the lady at the cashier, and I was not the only one. She used the same harsh tone to talk to a few customers in front and behind me who made the same mistake as I did. I believe this is not the Iraq day that you have experienced this issue. So for goodness sake, just place the in-house dining menu far away from the take-out cashier if you have different menu. Also, to the lady at the cashier: if you aren't keen in helping the customer, then please quit your job and not work In any service industry."

For $10 I was expecting a bowl of chili that would satisfy even a child's appetite. What came out was a shallow saucer with maybe 1  1/2 cup of chili and a huge glob of sour cream on top. Also to my disappointment, there was no cornbread! Serving chili with no cornbread is like getting a bowl of milk with no cereal...  The one thing I can say about this chili was that it was flavored well. The richness of the seasonings really came through and wasn't masked behind the ground beef and kidney beans.\n\nAfter a scorching afternoon in the Vegas sun, I was in the mood for something cool, refreshing and even a little healthier. Enter the Serendipity 3 Chopped Chicken Salad. If I could sum up this salad in one word, it would be: forgettable. Putting price aside ($16) what was presented was some chopped romaine lettuce mixed with some tomatoes, cucumbers and frozen chicken breast chunks tossed in ranch. The tomatoes did seem fresh, but the chicken breast was definitely of the frozen variety in which you could find at your local Coscto. I am still wondering how anyone could justify charging $16 dollars for this kind of salad.\n\nMy Complaint\n\n It is not unusual to have people in a large party order various things off the menu as their main dish - appetizers, entr\u00e9es, soups, salads etc. We had a few people order soup with a side salad as their meal and even a person who ordered a sundae as his meal! With that said, its not unreasonable to expect that everyone's order come out together so everyone can eat at the same time. I guess that expectation was too much for the staff at S3. One person got her soup before anything else came out... finished it, and then got her salad after while everyone else was still waiting for their food! Another friend ordered the Dinosaur Beef Ribs with a side of steamed broccoli. They're steamer must have been out-of-order because she didn't get her steamed broccoli until she was half way done with her ribs! Not only did everyone's food come out at different times, sides of an entr\u00e9e even  came out separately! I generally try to write positive reviews and tend to post on places I feel other people would enjoy. However, wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't share the horrible service at S3."

It was by far the worst service I have ever had and what makes it so bad is we only had dessert. First off, we waited about 20 minutes for our waiter to take our drink order, then another 10 for that to be served to us and then another 30 minutes for our desserts to come out. To top it off the dessert wasn't even that amazing. But what made it such a bad experience, I mean enough for me to write a review because I don't ever write reviews but this one I couldn't let go. The wait staff, they were horrible, no customer service skills what so ever. As we're sitting there waiting for our bill, the waiter finally comes to give it to us. Then sitting there waiting for him to take it, we see him clearing off other tables and taking dishes to the back and he doesn't come back out. So I flag a waiter down and ask him if he could get out waiter, which he said he would. Still no sign of him. So I finally walk up front to the hostess and ask him can we please pay our bill, we've been sitting there waiting for 30 minutes. He says he will get our waiter. Still no sign. Then we ask another waiter and finally he takes our bill to the back and gives it to our server. Finally 10 minutes he walks out with our credit card slips. Guess what bud no tip for you!! That was by far the worst experience in a restaurant that I have ever had!!! Never again will I go there or allow any of my family or friends to go there either"

The great service and fun environment lived up to the hype -- the food, not so much."

All it was, was some mediocre ice cream with a ton of half-melted whipped cream oozing off of it to make it look appealing. The burger was good, but next time we'd go to the burger place right next door at Caesar's. Maybe the frozen hot chocolate would have been better, but I don't think we'll go back to find out.

It has a cute little whimsical vibe that simply makes me happy every time I come here. \n\nSerendipity is known for desserts, including frozen hot chocolate and the $1,000 golden opulence sundae. (Yes, $1,000... don't think I'll ever try that one unless I hit it big in the casino.) The frozen hot chocolate is very rich and tasty, and definitely a good thing to try while in the hot desert. During my most recent trip, my husband and I spilt the cookie sundae. The two of us together couldn't even finish it! Cookie dough ice cream mixed with three fresh baked cookies and topped with whipped cream and hot fudge... yum!\n\nAll of the food I've ever had here has been pretty solid as well. The triple decker grilled cheese is my favorite. It's so flippin' cheesy and gooey! I love it! The portions are all very large and can easily be split between two... especially if you're planning on dessert. \n\nI always look forward to my next trip to Vegas, and Serendipity has become one of those staples for me that make the trip so great and fun."

The first time I came, I thought the Oreo frozen hot chocolate was good.The second time however, I made the mistake of ordering Vanilla. Avoid this flavor at all costs -  My tolerance for sweets are high enough, but this one was unbearably sweet. \n\nThe food is far too mediocre for their hefty prices. The dishes were unimpressive to the point where none of us finished them. If their prices had been lower, then I wouldn't have complaints about the quality of food.\n\nWhat prompts me to write a two star review was the poor customer service in my most recent visit. The restaurant wasn't too busy on a Wednesday afternoon, but everything about our experience was both slow and full of errors. To start, water took approximately 30 minutes to come, after having to flag the servers down a couple of times. The iced coffee came, not with our waters, but after our incorrect orders of food came. (And I had to ask her twice to bring the coffee) Receiving the wrong orders wasn't the problem, but I had to repeatedly ask our server to give us the correct ones. It was as if once she walked away from the table, she had already forgotten what we asked for. \n\nIf I had only had the frozen hot chocolate, I would've given Serendipity three stars."

To start, we had to wait at least 15 minutes on a weekday at 2pm for two people. There were plenty of empty tables inside and outside. The problem seemed to be that they lacked enough staff to actually clear and clean the tables as soon as patrons left.\n\nWhile we waited for our table, we stood outside and perished the menu posted on the wall. Was looking forward to trying their sundae with the humble pie. As soon as we sit down inside and look at the menu, we realize the menu isn't the same. I asked the waiter where the sundae was on the menu and he tells me that they don't make humble pie anymore and that the menu outside is old and they haven't bothered to change it.\n\nDisappointed, I order a cookie sundae and my friend orders the frozen hot chocolate - something she had been looking to try the whole trip.\n\nThe deserts come quickly. Her dessert is much smaller than the one they have in NYC. My sundae is mediocre. Basically just cookie dough ice cream and a cookie. 5 minutes after serving our desserts, our waiter comes and drops off the bill basically preventing us from ordering anything else.\n\nNeedless to say I won't be frequenting this location again.

We've been several times and will be back each time we are in Vegas.\n\nThat being said I can take my \"fan\" hat off long enough to offer an objective review ;)\n\nPrice Point?:  Moderate.  OK I sorta feel like the famous \"Frozzzen Hot Chocolate\" is seriously over-priced @ $15, but everything else is moderately priced.\n\nServing Sizes?: Huge!\n\nFood:  I really like it, though I can see why some people comment the food is not overly flavorful.  For me, I like subtle flavors so I'm generally happy with it.  Those who like an abundance of flavor may be a little disappointed.\n\nService?:  So-So.  I couldn't complain about the service levels, though there really is nothing special about them either.  We were there Christmas morning and the hostess wasn't dealing so well with being busy though - something that should be a given for a hostess but oh well.  If the service levels were better I'd give this restaurant a 5 all day long.\n\nSo what have I tried?!  Here's a quick list of some of the things my husband and I have tried when visiting:\n\nAlfredo:  I'm a pasta fan, I just can't resist.  I have to say this was the most enjoyable Alfredo I've had in, wow ages!  The pasta was not thick and starchy, the sauce was creamy yet amazingly light.  Flavors were spot on also.  This is my fav dish - haha obviously.  Serving size is quite big, It's more than enough for two meals for me and yup I take a doggie bag!\n\nSide Ceasar:  Generous portion of salad as a side, we shared it :)  They don't skimp on what's in it either.\n\nFoot-long Hot Dog with Chilli:  So this went down a treat with my husband.  Yes, it's huge!  He loved it though :)\n\nMeatball Sandwich: Hubby's choice, again he loved it!  Huge serving, he didn't get through it all but he truly enjoyed every bite he had.\n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate:  Yum :)  I couldn't finish mine, but I'm a light eater. OK this is obviously a signature drink, but as above in my mind it is over-priced.  I'd never order again - half of it is a seriously thick whipped cream.  Cream lovers rejoice, I couldn't get through even half of the cream though :P \n\nKobe Sliders:  These were just OK.  I'd not order them again though nor did the leave any lingering memories of their awesomeness.  If you want something smaller and lighter off the menu though, this is a plus.\n\nBanana Split:  Cowards Serving.  This is just decadent!!!  Banana, Chocolate Ice Cream, Strawberry Ice Cream, Vanilla Ice Cream, Chocolate Syrup, Caramel Syrup, Strawberry & Raspberry Syrup all topped off with whipped cream and Cherries.  This is just wow .... Seriously I ordered the cowards portion knowing I am a light eater and the server said it was great for one when really it would be good for 2 or 3.  If you have kids, let them share this size - I'd hate to see how big the $22/$24 serving is!!!!  It was great ... just wow a lot of food and no way I could get through more than 1/4 of it.\n\nPink Lemonade:  Err it wasn't pink but it tasted good.  Not sure if they offered free refills, part of the service lacking is the noticeably absent follow-up on trivial things like empty glasses.\n\nCheesecake:  HUGE!!!  2-4 people could share this.  I don't know if 1 person could realistically finish it.  Layers of Cheesecake with cream in-between served on a bed of Raspberry Syrup.  Saying this sat 5-6\" high is no exaggeration :P"

Parking is a pain, though, since you have to park at Caesar's and the walk is pretty far.  The best thing is to valet if you can because the walk from the valet is short.\n\nHowever, the food is hit or miss.  The first time I went I had the veggie burger.  It was okay, but not the tastiest.  The next time I had the chicken caesar salad, which I would not order again.  I love croutons and think they're one of the best things about caesar salad, but the ones they serve are huge (like a Rubik's cube almost!) and not crunchy.  This last time, I had a pizza and it was delicious.  So from now on, I'm pretty sure I'll stick to the pizza.  The sweet potato fries and the spinach artichoke dip are also really good.\n\nAnd then of course, there's the famous frozen hot chocolate.  Serendipity is one of my favorite movies so I really wanted to love the frozen hot chocolate.  It's good, but to be honest, it tastes pretty much like a chocolate frosty from Wendy's.  Just my opinion.  I'll still order it to share, though, just because it's fun."

The menu had a few good things on it, but we decided to go with the Steakhouse sandwich that was HUGE and TASTY! The frozen hot chocolate was pretty good too, but nothing to ga ga about.\n\nOverall, if you're in Vegas and can't figure out where to eat...do yourself a favor and try this place out."

What's really cool is that the hostess ask for one of our cell phone number and she texted us a msg to tell us to keep an eye out when she text us to tell us the seats are ready. More places need to implement this function! Instead of waiting an hour in front of the restaurants like dummies, we were able to walk around and sit down comfortably to chat in another area. \n\nI got the Frrrozen Hot Choco. Why is it over $10? It's not really that different than any other blended mocha that I had... in fact, I think Coffee Bean's is actually richer... The only thing that got the Frrozen Hot Choco going was the delicious whipped cream... that I told myself I would not finish... but ended up finishing anyways.\n\nIt makes a lot more sense to just go to the to-go window and grab it to go. But honestly, why even bother? It's just a really fancy place for a date with overpriced food that is not justifiable."

Our waitress made it a point to say, \"See, wasn't that quick service...?\"  Um, sweetie, NO.  There was a couple next to our table that walked out after being ignored by the staff.

Most seem to agree that this cold and chocolate delight is so tasty! The actual restaurant is another story though...\n\nI had been to window where you just order your frozen hot chocolate and don't have to worry about the insane crowded-ness of the restaurant. But when I was in Vegas last month, my group of girlfriends decided to be brave and take the longgggg wait. We lucked out with a 30-40 minute wait (pretty short by Serendipity standards). It's loud inside, and after sitting for about 10 minutes waiting for at least a drink order, my friend went up to a waiter and let him know that no one had come to our table. When our waiter finally did arrive, and another waiter swoops in out of nowhere and starts holding onto my shoulders (yikes!) and cheesily says \"ohhh this guy gets nervous around beautiful ladies. he was probably afraid\" and then flashes a weird smile. Yuck! Well after that weird moment ends we get some waters and look over the menu.\n\nMy friend and I decided to split the truffle pizza (post-Italy truffle obsession). Another friend orders a burger, and another pair of friends split the brie and turkey sandwich. Our pizza was big and retangular shaped. It was pretty good, nothing too memorable. My friends also enjoyed their food, but said it was nothing to rave about. We closed with the wonderful hot chocolate. \n\nThe setting it adorable and loud, the food is okay, the service is bizarre, and the frozen hot chocolate is to die for.

We were struggling to find breakfast places close by (we were staying at The Mirage).  The reviews we read said the portions were HUGE.  We were really hungry so we figured it would be perfect.  There was a short wait but we went and explored Caesars while we waited.\n\nWe first ordered the Frozen Oreo Hot Chocolate.  After a while it finally came out and it was HUGE.  We could have shared one.  By the time we had finished the whipped cream part we were full.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the bigger than your head pancakes.  He was very pleased with them but the review was right - they were HUGE! He only got through about 1/2 a stack before giving up.\n\nI ordered the Lucky 7s breakfast which came with 3 eggs, 2 sausage, 2 pancakes, and potatoes.  Coming from Jersey, I eat that kind of meal all the time at the local diners so I figured I could handle it.  I was wrong.  It was so big I barely made a dent. It was really good but I wasted a lot of food that morning.\n\nAs for the service, our waiter was average.  Many previous reviews complain about slow service- from what I noticed Las Vegas as a whole is EXTREMELY slow.  I am used to a fast paced Jersey/ NY atmosphere so everywhere we went was torturous.  It should never take 30-45 minutes to bring out a stack of pancakes and eggs.\n\nWe were satisfied with our meal but it took too long, portions were too big and price was too expensive."

I ate at the LV location 1.5 years ago and had a great experience, but this time ruined its reputation for me. I also am a frequent diner at the original NY restaurant, so it's upsetting that this establishment shares the same quality name.\n\nCame to eat a late lunch here last Saturday around 3pm. I was meeting up with some friends and was the first one to arrive, so I put my name down. We had a party of 7, so when she said it would be an hour wait, that seemed reasonable since the place was packed. However, then she said that they ran out of buzzers and that I should just wait in the area for my name to be called. Wait around for a HOUR? When I can walk around Cesar's Palace instead?? I wasn't happy but I complied and the waiting began.\n\nSince it was 3pm, and I hadn't eaten much that day and I had to wait around the restaurant, I decided to order a snack at the take-out window. Figured I would split a hot dog with my boyfriend while we waited since I was starving, and then when we were seated in a hour, I would order something lighter to complete my lunch. The take out window was super slow and inefficient but they guy serving us at the window provided good conversation. As I was waiting for my hot dog at the pick-up window, I hear my name called at the restaurant. WTF??? It had only been 20 minutes.\n\nThe hostess gave me attitude because she had been calling me name. Hey lady, what do you expect when you don't give me a buzzer!!! I explained to her that my party was ready but that I had just ordered a hot dog at Serendipity Take-Out and asked if I could bring it into the restaurant. She said NO and that she could seat the rest of my party but that she couldn't seat me if I wanted to bring in a hot dog. Even though my friends hadn't ordered any food yet and I had bought the hot dog from Serendipity, she wouldn't budge. So I canceled the whole table and my friends and I just ordered more food from Take-Out. \n\nThe whole ordeal just makes no sense. (1) Why would the hostess say the wait was an hour and then be able to seat us in 20 minutes?, (2) Why can't you bring Serendipity take-out into the restaurant if you are still going to buy food at the restaurant? And it's ALL THE SAME PLACE!,  (3) Serendipity is not some pretentious nightclub."

The 2 stars is based on the extra delicious frozen hot chocolate (that we had a coupon for, making it free), and the hot dog that ended up tasting pretty good. \n\nOk, so my husband and I got to Serendipity 3 at a decently off time. Didn't look too busy, so we put our names on the list and took a seat outside. We overheard someone say that if you sit at the bar you'll get served faster and you don't have to put your name on the list, so we tried that....didn't work. There are 4 or so chairs at the bar, so there went that idea. More waiting, waited so long that we had to eat a snack bar I had in my bag....before we ate lunch! I think our wait totaled about an hour for just the 2 of us. We were seated and it took our waiter 10 minutes before he came over to greet us and take our drink orders. Found out a few of the items that were on the menu were not supposed to be on there any longer (one of the items I was going to order, figures), so my husband ordered the grilled cheese with tomato soup and I ordered the mac & cheese. Simple enough. Our free frozen hot chocolate came out in this giant sundae glass,it was amazing! So good! We were expecting a tiny glass since it was free, but this could have fed a family of 4! Our food came out 35 or so minutes later, and my mac & cheese tasted like lighter fluid! It was so gross that even thinking about it right now makes me gag a bit. My husband's grilled cheese was gross too, same lighter fluid taste. Even his soup tasted like lighter fluid! I assumed it was the way they were cooking things so we brought this to the waiter's attention. He took my food back and came back to tell us that the cooks had no idea why it tasted like that and that no one else had complained. He offered to replace my gross food with something else, so I ordered a hot dog. Figured it would be safe since it wasn't covered in whatever gross cheese they were using. \n\nWe waited for my hot dog for 30 minutes!  A HOT DOG! I'm kind of hypoglycemic so by this point I was feeling pretty weak. I started spacing out, feeling nauseated, it was all I could to stay calm. My hot dog FINALLY came and I was at that point in my 'episode' where I was super nauseated, so I took a few bites and got a to-go box, which took another 10 minutes. It was just annoying how much time we spent waiting and the food wasn't even good. I ate my hot dog an hour or so later after I was feeling better and it was pretty good. If I ever went there again i'd go straight for that and a frozen hot chocolate, that's it. And i'd get it from the to-go window, not even bother going inside. My husband is curious about this giant donut we saw in the to-go window, so we might check that out next time. Not going out of our way though."

You'd think it's the same potatoes you get with other breakfast entrees...you know, the kind that you slather on tons of ketchup because it'd be bland otherwise. But nooo, not these potatoes. These were crisp like chicken nuggets and had seasoning, so it was yummy by itself. Pair that with a bite of the omelet and I was on my way to food coma. \n\nBut wait! You can't leave Serendipity without an order of their ice cream sundae. They all looked good, but I settled on the deep fried Oreo and cream sundae. Five deep fried Oreos sitting on a mountain of cookies and cream ice cream, whipped cream, marshmallow fluff, more bits of normal Oreos, with a cherry on top. OMG, so much sugar. The deep fried Oreos are enough to do you in. By this point, water refills were a life saver. Sadly, I couldn't finish the sundae after having two deep fried Oreos and a lot of spoonful of the ice cream, but I would not hesitate to return to try some of the other less decadent sundaes. Their strawberry sundaes look just as mouthwatering."

Surprisingly, this burger can give In-N-Out the runs for its money.  This burger is huge. You can feed two people with this burger.  The price $15 buck for this burger (with lettuce, tomato, red onions) along with fries and a slice of pickle.\n\nege benedict: no no\n\nbacon burger: same as above\n\nchocolate cake: awesome! you probably can become a diabetic and get a heart attack with this cake. huge proportion, but very tasty. very chocolatty (they are famous for chocolate after all)\n\nFood: 4/5  with large proportion. ( I saw a fat man (politically correct: horizontal over proportion man) who could not finish his plate)\n\nAmbiance: 4/5 cheesy for my taste, but white/pinkish dainty for everybody else. The waiters dress in black uniform. \n\nCleanlyness: 5\n\nService: 3/5 we wait for 10 minutes for the waiter to come around. we wait another 20-30 min for the food.  Granted, we came at lunch time, but the waiters are busy. the waiting time for a table is 45 min to 1 hour. \n\nCost: 3/5 (average $12-20 per dish)\n\nOverall: 3.5/5.  I really like the burgers.  I would give it a four if either cost was better or the waiters are better. \n\nOn the side note, while we were eating, Chef Ramsey Gordon, walks in.  Suddenly all hell broke loose!  All the chefs came out of the kitchen to talk to Ramsey and the waiters just freeze.  The whole place suddenly hush as if the pope was in the building.  This becomes a celebrity sighting and you see some customers jump out of their seats to greet him.  Nobody ask him for autographs, but Ramsey was nice and courteous and went to the patio/verranda to have his lunch with a group of friends.  I bet you his service was much better than my."

Secondly, it just tasted like chocolate, like the regular chocolate shake you can get from IN-N-OUT.  Didn't taste like no hot chocolate flavor I was expecting.

I think she was having a bad day or just hated her job. Nonetheless, her service was terrible. She made it seemed like we were wasting her time. \n\nMy husband ordered a margherita pizza. It came with just cheese. If you want to add toppings, it's a dollar each. We ended up paying $18 for a soggy pizza with no flavor. I ordered a breakfast burger and asked for it medium rare. It came out well one and greasy. It was basically a cheeseburger with an over easy egg. It also came with some sort of home fries but it was so dry and hard. We had to order the frozen hot chocolate.

When we finally did get into the restaurant, I ordered the steak and egg sandwich, again very pricey. I have to admit that the sandwich itself was not THAT great. The yolk from the egg was in that kind of coagulated state where it's not really runny and not really solidified either. Also, the skirt steak was a bit dry for my liking. The size of it was really large though. My mom ordered an almond frozen hot chocolate, with my suggestion, and it was not nearly as good as my sister's. The almond one was like little bits of ice floating around in a slight almond flavor with whipped cream and almonds on top. Not the kind of sensation I would expect for an $8-$10 signature drink.

I would have cried!) \n\nAnyways, on to the food..\nI ordered the Fried Eggs Benedict which was amazing!! I'm not sure how they bread the egg and fry it but however they figured that out, it works! The plates are huge, be warned! I could only finish one out of my two benedicts but it was one of the best eggs benedict I've had. \nMy boyfriend got the fried chicken and waffles, which he has been wanting to try forever and he was in heaven. He kept going on and on, and is still going on about how good they were! Which I won't disagree with because the chicken was perfectly crispy along with the potatoes and the waffles were melt-in-your-mouth fluffy. \n\nOverall, I'm happy we skipped the buffet and found Serendipity. Next time I am going to have to try one of those deep fried Oreo milkshakes!"

The waitress recommended the mushroom quiche so I went for it.  Everything was going fine, it's not the best food but you know, it will do.  I found a baked long piece of blonde hair in my quiche.  It made me want to barf.  They had a manager walk over and apologize.  They then took it off the menu but didn't comp our meal at all.  Now, if you're in the middle of eating your food and you find a hair, but not just a hair, a baked long hair, wouldn't that be grounds to walk away and say \"this bill's on us?\"  \n\nGROSS!

The place in NYC was made famous in the movie serendipity but from what I read on yelp, the place gets so busy crowded where an hour wait is the norm.  Well I never did head out to NYC to try it but since I was in Vegas early feb, I made it a point to go.\n\nFirst off, the decor of the place was so sugary sweet w/ vintage chandeliers against pink walls.  We didn't even have to wait long & was seated right away. You can order the frozen hot chocolate in two sizes & oh my goodness, so delish.  We ordered the big size to share btw three.  If I wasn't being polite at the time, u best believe I would've taken the whole bowl & ate it all up - Yumm!\n\nI may just need hit up NYC one day just to say I've gone & been there and  I wouldn't mind having the frozen hot chocolate while I'm at it, of course. :P"

We were seated pretty quickly which was nice, but that was the only nice thing.  After being seated, a server never even came to our table to ask if we wanted drinks.  We sat there for 30 minutes waiting without even getting acknowledged by the two waiters working the area even when we tried to get their attention.  3 groups were seated after us and received service.  I could understand if it was busy and they didn't have enough staff to cover the outside, but from the looks of it, the 2 servers outside were just plain pissed off about something and it wasn't that busy.  30 minutes is an inexcusable amount of time to wait to even have a server take a drink order.\n\nIt's too bad because the food sounded good."

Well what do you know, as I was browsing through a booklet of coupons from the hotel, the coupon just magically jumped out and screamed. Free frozen hot chocolate with a $10 purchase.\n\nSince the coupon was only valid for dine-in, we had no choice but to sit inside. The minute we sat down, it just felt weird to me. Everything was so girly and pink. Pastel colors everywhere. I immediately wanted to go to some grimy, hole-in-a-wall sports bar for some much needed \"cleansing.\" But hey, I was gonna stick it out.\n\nWe looked up and down the ridiculously overpriced menu, searching for something fairly inexpensive to share. We settled on the chicken strips for a whopping $12. There were 6 strips, so $2 each, which is absurd. As expected, they were bad. Terribly dry, bland, and too thick of a crust. If they want a lesson on making good chicken strips, they need to hit up Raising Canes.\n\nOn to the frozen hot chocolate, which was surprisingly good, in my opinion. It did it's job. It was essentially a giant chocolate slushee with whipped cream on top. I'm a sucker for slurpees and slushees and icees, especially on a hot day. And it was free. Call me a fan. Would I order it again, though? Probably not. 4 stars for the frozen hot chocolate. 2 stars for the chicken strips."

They were crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. With the ice cream it was a great combination.\nBe warned, watch the sizes. They don't mess around here. A small is huge and a huge is insane. Between me and my girlfriend we could not finish a small of either one.\nNow this is an ice cream parlor. Yes they serve food but it is just ok. It is good don't get me wrong but their thing is ice cream and that is what you came for anyway. We got the nachos. I love the big chips. Again they don't do small here. They had lots of cheese and meat. It was warm and gooey and good but not great. Again ice cream place. I have said it before if you go to the burger place you don't order tacos or go to a steakhouse and order fish. You came to an ice cream parlor for ice cream.\nDo yourself a favor and get the Frozen Hot Chocolate if you have never had it. If you have I don't need to tell you because you already ordered it. It is something that they came up with and is one of the best ideas ever.\nWe will be back for sure. This is a great place for dessert. Really is the best ice cream around."

Came in on a Tuesday morning so wasn't a wait at all. The other breakfast food items looked good but massive as the servers brought them out to adjacent tables. \n\nMy friend and I both independently decided on the Mint Frrrozen Hot Chocolate and reasoned that it was cheaper to order the \"For Two\" sized portion of the same flavor. It was a huge glass/bowl, and about 1/3 was just whipped cream. The frozen hot chocolate itself was very minty, and I did like the touch of Andes mints on top. It was refreshing, cool especially after walking around the Strip in 80 degree weather, and not too frozen that it was hard to drink through the straw. The spoons provided we mostly used to tackle the whipped cream, haha. \n\nThat was the only item we got off the menu since I had to get to the airport soon after, and all I can say is wowzers...calorie-wise that was pretty much my breakfast and lunch allocation in one sitting. Seriously, 850 calories in a \"for one\" serving! Gosh. Maybe next time I'll try Max Brenner since I missed that chance in Boston as well."

After that we tried their all famous frrrozen hot chocolate for two. for the price of 15 it was well worth it. just imagine hot chocolate but in a mocha form. all  of their frrrozen hot chocolates cost the same. they have a variety of different kinds so we got the white chocolate one. it was damn good. the next time i come here im trying something different.\n\nservice: is damn excellent. i mean every time i would ask for something such as more water or a knife or something i would always get the \"right away boss\" \"here you go boss\" its nice to hear that but i gotta give it to them because not every restaurant does that. Our waiter was nice. cleaned our tables. picked up our empty plates. etc... there were times when the place would be crowded so they would forget  what i asked for but its understandable.\n\nLocation: this is vegas by the way so i can really say anything about where its placed. i mean shoot lucky we stayed at ceasers cause i gotta say parking was a bitch. i mean pedestrians not caring about traffic walk signs is one thing but having everyone turn into the same place is hell enough. as i stated, luckily we stayed at Caesar's palace. we just walked over .\n\nSide note: we were seated rather quickly, but this is random cause there are times when there are a couple of tables open and there are times when every table is occupied.\n- they also have a wide range of desserts too. From gigantic sundaes that can feed a family of four to a banana split where the bowl or whatever that hold it all together can be barely seen."

I came here with a friend who's been here a numerous amounts of times.  The decor and ambiance of this place was actually fantastic. It reminded me of the bubblegum candy land and a little bit of sexy hip at the same time. \n\nThe wait was about 25minutes, not bad for dinner on a weekday, and we were seated promptly inside with a view of the strip. That night we saw Penn & Teller eating dinner on the outside balcony, poor guys couldn't even enjoy their night being bothered by tourists and fans, let the men eat!! **My little highlight for the night!**\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad with homemade Garlic Parmesan Croutons that cost almost close to $20 (but it was a huge mixing  bowl portion) While the size might have given you your money's worth, the fish was too fishy and half cooked, the lettuce was drowning in a mayonnaise based Caesar dressing so It was soggy. The only good thing was the Garlic bread/over sized croutons. The disappointment of my night. \n\nAfter my not-so-appetizing dinner, i was sort of looking forward to a dessert called the Frozen Hot Chocolate, but didn't get the chance to because they ran out of ingredients, so they suggested the hot chocolate sundae. What? isn't it chocolate and ice that you need to make this dessert? Ugh So we opted for the Strawberry Fields Sundae, cheesecake, strawberry ice cream, strawberry topping with whipped cream all for $15.00!!! SERIOUSLY? There was two scoops of ice cream on the bottom of a goblet topped with strawberry compote and LOADS of whip cream. Really is that necessary? \n\nIn the end, I made a note to myself that I will never come here again, nor will I suggest this place to anybody. Chili's or Apple-bees in my opinion makes better quality foods at a decent-not-so-overrated price! \n\nNever again."

In order to cut costs (we are all poor students!), we decided to split everything. It worked out perfectly! We had appetizer, entree, and two desserts! I paid about $18, which included tax and gratuity. I was full, but not overstuffed and I thought it was well worth it. We didn't try their famous frozen hot chocolate, but did have the banana split and got a red velvet chocolate sundae on the house. Both were delicious and totally satisfied my chocolate craving! Yummy yum yum.\n\nThe onion rings weren't bad either. They were nice and crunchy. A friend and I shared the pesto italian pizza. It's a flatbread style pizza that's a decent size. If I were really hungry, I would've wanted it all to myself. The wait was about 30 mins. for a party of 8. Not bad."

I wanted a frozen hot chocolate and was lucky to get there when the lines weren't too long. I didn't go to the window outside. I was able to go up to the bartender inside and ordered my beverage. It cost about $12 and, to be completely honest, it was almost exactly the same as the chocolate chip frappe at McDonald's. Food looked good, but I didn't partake."

The manager was super rude when we were trying to be helpful with giving up one of our chairs we didn't need.   The only bonus was our server who never frowned or was rude  he was completely upbeat and knew  the menu.   The corn beef hash had no flavor and the the eggs were over cooked.   The potatoes my friend got were the last crumbs and she didn't get any real potato.  The saving grace was the amazing server and dessert."

            "review": "This restaurant was definitely quite pricey for the quality of food they serve. The food was mediocre at best, with the highlight being the free hot fudge sundae (we had a coupon). The food was incredibly heavy and honestly, didn't feel much better than your local Olive Garden/Cheesecake Factory. This place is kind of crowded, especially on weekends and you definitely have to make reservation at least a day ahead of time (don't know why, nothing so great here).\n\nThe service was also very odd. Our waitress changed her attitude very clearly after we decided to not order alcoholic drinks. Not only that, she was serving a table next to us and she was definitely speaking to them inappropriately about something, telling the other table that they should not be doing certain things due to the fact that she will get in trouble for it (waiters should not be saying this to customers). She also went into a long-winded story with them about how she got into trouble. She spoke incredibly loudly and even in the loud restaurant, I could hear her from when she was serving the other table near us. This definitely made us feel very uncomfortable there.\n\nProbably won't come back again, since there's plenty of other awesome restaurants in Vegas."

            "review": "So I finally tried this place that is oh-so popular in NYC, but you can now find it in Las Vegas. It's right off the strip, in front of Caesars Forums called Serendipity 3. They are known for their signature Frozen Hot Chocolate. My friend and I had the Alfredo pasta and macaroni and cheese. At first we were like \"this is amazing!\". That was only because we were hungry, after the first few bites we realized the food was okay and not that great. Prices were pricey and it seems like the food is large portioned. My mac & cheese didn't seem so big but when I realized when I was done eating, I still had enough to feed another person. Prices average between $14.00 to $1,000.00 (if you decide to get one of their Golden Opulence Sundaes). I wasn't going to let my disappointing dinner get to me! I was there for their Frozen Hot Chocolate. It's about $9.00 and for the double frozen hot chocolate, I think it's about $11.00. My friend and I shared the regular frozen hot chocolate. Was I disappointed? Actually no! It tastes just like what it's called. If you ever had hot chocolate, its just like that, but served cold with thin ice chips in it, sooooo yummy. I would definitely come back, but probably only for desert. Don't care much to spend an arm and a leg for the food. Definitely a place to splurge on desert!"

            "review": "The Serendipity 3 at Caesars is a decent enough place serving mostly diner food dressed up with clever names.  It's a place people visit for the novelty, so expect it to be crowded and busy during meal times and weekends.  A more efficient and professional wait staff would make the experience more pleasurable, but with a line of people waiting to get in, the servers don't seem to feel the need to impress anyone.  It's an \"alright\" spot to hang out, grab some food, and people watch - if you're not in a hurry to get anywhere.\n\nPros:\nAverage food\nPeople watching\nStrip location\n\nCons:\nService\nFood Quality\n\nOver the past few years, I have been to the Serendipity a handful of times, most recently in late August of 2011.  My wife has this \"thing\" about visiting this place, but she's assured me that she's completely over the novelty/fascination.  One look around and you'll know that everyone is here for the same reason - it's kind of funny/cute...hey, it's Vegas.  Make sure you walk around and take in some of the sites and eclectic surroundings.  You can always get your food to go and eat outside, although it does get pretty hot during the daytime.\n\nThe food is average: stay with the sandwiches and burgers - you can't go wrong, the other items are hit and miss, for example, the crab cakes were fishy and gross.  Everyone gets the frozen hot chocolate or some other dessert - nothing special and not much different from what you'd get at your local ice cream parlor.  \n\nYMMV depending on your expectations, taste in food, and luck: although I've always had poor service, if you are a group of very cute girls and you get a male server, you will get good service...know what I mean?  Unfortunately, it's \"that kind of place\" where the servers aren't professional and are easily distracted from their duties.  If they screw up your order, I suggest that you make the best of the situation and eat it because it will take an hour or two for the replacement dish to come out.\n\nIn my opinion, the Serendipity 3 in Vegas relies on the draw of their name and offers little more than an average dining experience on the Strip.  A few minor tweaks to the service and quality control of the food, and this place would actually be ok.  Keep in mind that there are places with worse food and poorer service, so don't be afraid to give it a shot if it's on your \"Vegas Do List.\""

Loved loved loved the frozen hot chocolate, and the ambience of the NYC Serendipity was cozy and charming.  Haven't been to NY in a while, so I was excited to see that they opened a Serendipity in Las Vegas!!   You know... it's just not the same. Everything is Vegas is BIG... every one does everything BIG... Serendipity 3 just felt like a big, regular restaurant on the strip.  Nothing charming... just a restaurant.  I can't complain about the food.  We went for lunch.  Two of us had an omelette, another the Nachos.  The food was good, the portions were nice (and FYI... their breakfast potatoes that come with the omelettes are AWESOME!!!!).   What I didn't like is the crazy wait.  We checked in at 12:30pm.  Yeah, sure, it's peak lunch time.  It took us about an hour and a half to be seated.  Not the most pleasant experience.  And it was a bit frustrating cause I could see them calling and taking people behind us on the list... not sure what type of system they use.  Our waitress though was fab!  Great service!  But if you're looking for that same NY experience, and wanting to re-live that Serendipity movie scene.... aside from the gigantic frozen hot chocolate... that's where the similarity ends."

For those who are interested in coming here for the \"frozen hot chocolate\" they have two sizes available, the 10 ounce (for one)  for $10 and 16 ounce (for two) for $14, I decided to go with the 16 ounce which was more than enough for me. Our waitress was really nice, and got our order in real quick, and when they brought my drink I couldn't wait to dive in. I started drinking it through the straw and could only taste the frozen chocolate, a tip to those first timers, the hot chocolate is on top so it's best to use a spoon to scoop from the bottom so you can get the combination of both hot and cold. The \"frozen hot chocolate\" was good, I don't think it exceeded my expectations but was definitely good and I would have it again. \n\nI browsed through their menu and they also offer many other deserts that look just as delicious, everything from banana splits to a $1000 Opulence Sundae. The food here also looks good, it's your normal American restaurant with burgers, sandwiches and french fries."

The friendly hostess took our names and told us the wait would be around 45 minutes - and 45 minutes later we were being seated at our table.\n\nWow we had a great time. My kids were entertained by Kyle our happy and friendly server. We ordered the Empire State Onion Ring Tower to start - it came sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and two dipping sauces.\n\nMy wife then ordered the Serendipity Chicken Salad - the \"signature\" salad - dressing on the side because it is very saucy. I ordered the chicken pot pie, and the kids ordered a $15 (about a dollar an inch) hot dog to split. It was all very good. My son was psyched when Kyle delivered the relish tray with 5 different toppings and sauces. \n\nThe Salad - crunchy and fresh with red and yellow grape tomatoes, hearts of palm, chicken, and fresh corn cut from the cob. 5 Stars - very large and good enough to eat without the salad dressing.\n\nThe chicken pot pie. It was hot and fresh. The pie shell was cooked to perfection and fluffy. It was filled with large chunks of chicken, peas, carrots, and potatoes. Very tasty - 4 stars.... a little small - put good for the health conscious that don't want the \"hungry man\" portions.\n\nThe hot dog was a long as my son's whole arm. He loved it and dug into the relish and onion toppings. My daughter loved her portion of the hot dog as well. The homemade bun was toasted perfectly - and the hot dog was all beef with no mystery meat. I tried a bite and was very impressed. 4.5 stars.\n\nOn to dessert - first the New York Brownie Sundae - excellent and divine with a huge three layer fudge cake in the middle of an huge scoop of chocolate ice cream. 5 Stars. \n\nThe Double Frozzzen Hot Chocolate - it lived up to the hype - it was really good and came with 4 straws. My kids loved the whipped cream and the frozen chocolate goodness. 5+ Stars.\n\nOverall the bill was a little less than 100 - with a 20% tip for our excellent waiter.\n\nIn conclusion - great service, great food, great atmosphere. It was worth the wait and the price. For those of you with \"Baskin and Robbins\" comments - those are in the food court at the outlet mall and  in every town in America - splurge a little it's VEGAS! Save the $1 Whopper and a water budget or 1.49 Big Gulp / Big Bite combo adventure for your own home town.\n\nP.S. - the high prices keep out the \"riff raff\" - which makes a more pleasant dining experience."

We started off with the spudkins (potato skins) for an appetizer, which were really good and a big portion. My boyfriend got the steak sandwich, which he thought was okay/good. I ordered the high heel pump sandwich (prosciutto, mozzarella, arugula, tomatoes, etc). It had great flavor, but was piled with so many tomatoes, I had to take the majority of them out just so I could taste something other than tomatoes. Both sandwiches were huge and came with fries, which I thought was good for the price. We also ordered the frozen hot chocolate for dessert since so many people seem to love it and recommend it. I love all types of sweets but my boyfriend and I both agreed the frozen hot chocolate was definitely nothing special. While we enjoyed most of the food, we were sooo disappointed by the service. About two minutes into receiving our appetizer, the waiter brought out our sandwiches (this is something that realllly annoys me). Then, we went through the entire meal without our waiter checking on us once, which meant no drink refills when we needed it. After about a half hour, our waiter finally came over to refill our drinks which we then waited about another 15 minutes for him to do so. We also noticed that his other tables were not being waited on as well..(Not to mention, the place was not busy by any means) Once our dessert came, our waiter asked us how we liked the frozen hot chocolate... twice... within a couple minutes of each other. We both came to the conclusion that he seemed to be a little drunk!  Overall, the food has good flavor and comes in very generous portions for the price you're paying. However, the service is definitely not the best."

I wasn't expecting stellar service, but some service would have been nice. We were seated and apparently there aren't sections bc we had a few servers come to our table attempting to take our order. \n\nOur food came out 30 min later - we ordered hot wings and 2 frozen hot chocolates. The wings were standard. The frozen hot chocolate came out a nasty soupy mess. It is essentially an overpriced iced down chocolate milk shake w gobs of whipped cream. I really wanted to like it here, but they failed. 2 stars because the actual restaurant is really cute."

I waited about 40 minutes for ONE very simple, yet expensive dessert. I expected the quality to at least be great, but it was sightly above average at best. Nobody in my group was impressed.\n\nIn addition, a few of my friends recently received melted ice cream from this place. For a restaurant that is known for its desserts, that is unacceptable. Never mind, that should be unacceptable everywhere!\n\nSatisfy your sweet tooth somewhere else."

Lucky for me I was in the area and decided that I must have their frozen hot chocolate & being a fan of foot long hotdogs, I decided to try that as well. Although I shared the frozen hot chocolate with my date, I could only get through 3/4 of my foot long. I even had the waiter cheering me on to finish it but I just couldn't. The combination is extremely filling. Everything was great and liked how attentive the staff was. I especially enjoyed the decor, very fun and inviting.

Our waiter seemed like he was always in a hurry, my friend an I ordered the Oreo frozen hit chocolate but I guess he didn't hear it correctly cause we got a regular/original one for two...I didn't care but just seemed like he wasn't listening. The food was decent, I got the full monty which was good and my friend got the crab cake salad (The crab cake wasn't that great and they didn't slice the grapefruit segments very nicely so it wasn't that easy to eat. When we  were about to leave we couldn't find our waiter half the time but overall it was still a cute experience. \n\nOh the frozen hot chocolate did taste like hot chocolate but in a somewhat slushy-like consistency haha.

            "review": "A bit delayed on my reviews but finally getting around to it as I went to Vegas two months ago. BUT I still remember the taste of the Famous Frozen Hot Chocolate so don't think my review wont count because as a food junkie, I keep notes on my iPhone and I remember ^.^\n\nSo like some of my friends reviews would say, it IS a bit hyped up AND pricey for a Chocolate shake. However, I think its not too terrible. To me, a milkshake is thick, rich and creamy. However, this didn't have the texture of a traditional milkshake so its not quite the same. I had the Peanut Butter Frozen Hot Chocolate. I thought it was really good but was it worth the 13 bucks? Maybe its more worth 8 bucks in my opinion.\n\nI would definitely recommend my friends to check it out but I wouldn't hype it up for them because when something is hyped, we create this huge expectation that it should be fabulous. Overall I give Serendipity 3 a solid 3 stars. We waited a good 45 minutes to be seated and for 3 of my friends to share a small chip appetizer and having a shake to ourselves each, we spent about $22 each including the gratuity and for the wait and price, I didn't think it was quite worth it...but worth it in a sense to try something new and different and \"hyped\" about, one should check it out."

I luckily found a groupon which was even better.  First the service was sub par.  They had 3 hostesses that stand around. They also do not have bathrooms in the restaurant.  You have to go outside walk around and then go down into this \"cave\".   Then the public restroom was gross and reminded me of nasty public park toilets (they are metal toilets). It took about 20-30 minutes once seated just to get our water! The house salad was mediocre.  Their balsamic was ok.  My friend and I both got burgers.  I got the ABC burger because that is what the waiter said was their good one and it was the blandest thing ever.  I didn't even eat half of it.  The burger had no seasoning, the had no seasoning, and they didn't put condiments on it.   They have a lot of fries already made up so they were not the best and luke warm.  We did have their romano cheese onion rings.  Those were WONDERFUL.  I would totally eat those again.  My friend and I also shared a frozen hot chocolate.  It was ok.  I make them at home with real chocolate but the one here tasted like it had a slight powder taste.  I probably would have liked it better if I never had made my own to get that true delicious chocolate taste.  All in all I will not be back to eat, but maybe grab the onion rings to go."

My sister and I literally let out squeals of delight and started screaming \"we gotta come here for dessert!!!\" yes, we did, in a bus full of strangers and we were possibly jumping up and down in the process. Did i mention, I'm 29 and my sister is 26.. and yes we still get excited for ice cream. \n\nWhat we didn't realize, was there was this Buddhist shrine that's been donated to Cesare's and was placed right in front of Serendipity (super random right?) It was incredibly gorgeous with sand pits for incense, and they even provided incense and matches for prayers! Being the Buddhist we are, my sister, mommy and i promptly lit up and did some prayers. Was funny because there were all these people passing by us and they started taking pictures of us during our prayer. YEA US! \n\n\nWhat I Thought: We got there around 9:30pm on a weds night and the wait was only 25 mins. We were seated indoors (thank god, even at night it was bloody hot) I've heard so much about Serendipity (blame food network) i was extremely excited we found time in our schedule to stop by. And yes, i realize the \"frozen hot chocolate\" is really just glorified chocolate milk, but the point is.. I REALLY WANTED ONE!!! (damn you perky Rachel Ray for putting the thought in my head) \n\nWho I Dragged Along: Ros and our Mommy \n\nAtmosphere: Uber cute!, very sweet candy shop feel. \n\nPrice: For the 3 of us, the total was $50-something including tax and tip. \n\nWhat We Ate: We decided to share a meal since we knew we wanted to make room for dessert. \nSpinach/Artichoke dip - serious yum with huge pieces of shaved parm on top, my mom adored this \n3 cheese omelet with waffle fries - oomg FLUFFIEST OMELET EVER!!! It was seriously huge, I'm thinking..maybe 6 eggs went into it? It was soft, fluffy, filled with goooey cheese and was seriously.. perfect! \nVanilla/coffee hot fudge sundae - my sister's choice, it was good as far as sundae's go, but.. $14 for ice cream and chocolate sauce? ummm... \nFrozen hot chocolate - Ok.. so $11 for basically... chocolate milk blended with ice and a load of whipped cream on top, and don't get me wrong, it was rich, creamy and delish! I drank nearly the entire thing and it was great for a 1 time thing to do. But really.. i was.. i dunno, underwhelmed? \n\nParking: ride the deuce baby!! \n\nWould I Come Back: yes and i want the omelet when i do! seriously, yummiest omelet ever! \n\nDid i miss anything?: Did i mention the omelet? I gotta mention our waitress, she was awesome, attentive and took great care of us.\nMy mom is fantastic, but like a typical Asian Mom, she complains a bit... nothing was said about this place, so if it pleases Mom, it makes our night a Lil happier!"

He will sign up every year for as long as he can run & I will attend all events associated with the Rock N Roll Las Vegas for how ever long they will offer the VIP Spectator option. During this day the restaurant is closed to the public & only the VIPs are allowed in. To help the staff differentiate the VIP from regular patrons, we are asked to wear bracelets. \n\nSerendipity 3 is a great location as it is on the strip & located right in front of Ceasars Palace where both the marathon & half marathon races finish.\n\nThe set up at this location is beautiful & it gets better each year. There is a covered outdoor patio with tables covered in table cloths & center pieces of roses & hydrangeas. There are also comfortable sofas, plush chairs & pillows. The patio can be cold but there are heaters above to keep you warm. I advise all to bring jackets/coats & scarves as this is the dessert & when it's not hot, it's usually cold. Today it is cold, windy & starting to sprinkle. \n\nThey have a number of different dishes, platters of food, drink, dessert & even a pasta station. Oh, and all of it is free because that is included in the price for the VIP status. \n\nThe food is phenomenal! You can eat until you can not eat anymore! The staff is super friendly & accommodating. \n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE VIP POST RACE DINNER HERE & THE RESTAURANT IN GENERAL! \n\nI am biased as I get special treatment at the VIP event, so please take that into consideration. \n\nPics to follow shortly after & a few edits..."

High heel pump sandwich ($16) is HUGE, but it's also a got so much going on in it it that it becomes a big sloppy mess to eat.

The restaurant is small but plenty of tables outside where you can have better view. The Food , it was great especially if it's made by very friendly chef who came over to our table and made us a dessert that we requested. You better try the chicken wings , it's the bomb and the pasta with vodka ummm. Over all I enjoyed coming here and will definitely come back when I visit LV again. Love love love it"

White chocolate frozen hot choco was too sweet and the carrot cake sundae was mediocre. I went again last night in hopes that they were just having a bad night when I went the first time. But I was let down again. The chocolate blackout cake sundae was overwhelmingly sweet once again with no depth to the flavors what so ever. I would have gotten the same effect if I made my own at home with Hershey's chocolate sauce. When I am charged over $20 for cake and ice cream, I expect it to be pretty outstanding which Serendipity 3 just can't seem to do."

The side salad was very nice with a bunch of different vegetables, and it was very large, but unfortunately overdressed - which was too bad because it was otherwise pretty tasty.  I should've asked for dressing on the side.\n\nI really enjoyed the sliders - there were 4 of them, and I only ate two since I was saving room for dessert.  I think for the average person, this is an adequate sized meal.  The burgers were cooked more on the medium rare side, which is what I like.  They were juicy and tasty.  The bacon and the aioli were great.\n\nOf course, I had to try the frozen hot chocolate for dessert.  It is way too huge for one person, but I managed to finish about 3/4 of it.  I'm not sure I'd rush back to order it, but I'm glad I at least tried it once, and it was good.  Too bad it melts so fast though.  I ordered the original, but if I go back again, I think I'd try another one (sounds like the Frozen Oreo is popular)."

I was really hoping that I would be able to find at the very least two or three different options what I found was a scoop of sorbet was my only option. Even though I was kind of heart broken that I couldn't fully experience this cute little place, I went ahead and ordered my sorbet ... Well, my waitress forgot to bring it out. She brought out everyones food ( which I couldn't order anything) and then when she brought out dessert mine was missing. By the time she came back my friends were done with their meals and desserts that I had to tell her to forget about it. The place is really cute, the view of the strip is nice ( outside patio) but the service wasn't great and their aren't really options for us Gluten free and Vegan people. Want to go for the decor?

Remember all those women on the Titanic who waved off the dessert cart.\"  ~Erma Bombeck\n\nHaha I love that quote! : ) Well here's my review of Serendipity 3. I think you're going to like reading it! : ) I had as much fun writing it as I did eating here. : ) Enjoy : ) Henry\n\n\nTHE FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE!\n\n     It was SO GREAT I'm just going to list my top ten ways I'd describe it to a friend. Here goes, they are the following: \n\n1. Greek God Worthy\n2. HolyHotChocolateBatman\n3. The Facebook of Desserts\n4. Nothing On Earth Like It on Earth\n5. #Dessert Hashtag Warranted\n6. A Get out of Diet Jail Free Card\n7. Yummy in My Tummy\n8. A Full Body Massage in a Cup\n9. 112 Points on Words With Friends\n10. 14 out 10 people will like this, trust me\n\nYou're going to love it as much as I did for sure! Let me know what you think! :D\n\n\nTHE FRIED OREO SUNDAE!\n\n     If you come in with at least 1 person with you, you have to order something like this. Just from a standpoint of picture taking and memories, it's an unforgettable moment that you will remember forever. It's a priceless food fun photo opp, followed by an EPIC journey for sure for any DESSERT LOVER! It was soooo much fun to attempt to make it through as much of the bowl as I could. Deep breathing techniques and stretching in my chair was not enough to overpower and complete this Colossal Sundae... As I stared it square in the face I decided my best bet about half way through was to finish off the FRIED OREOS! YES They are so delicious and if you haven't had them, then you need to order this one just to try em! They are that GREAT! \n\n\nENTREE - CRAB CAKE SALAD\n\n     I was soooooo impressed by how great the food was here! I ordered a CRAB CAKE SALAD which I can say with certainty was one of the BEST CRAB CAKES in Vegas. Bar none. It looked perfect (check out my picture of it in their photos) ... it tasted perfect! and it was surrounded by a fantastic salad made up of an awesome blend of greens tossed with a light and delicious dressing. \n\n\nENTREE -         was \"BEST OF MY LIFE\"\n\n     I also have to quote one more plate I had here, and it's something I thought i'd never be stating a had a \"BEST OF MY LIFE\" of ... because it's something I've had, and you reading this, have probably had a million times in your life. CHICKEN FINGERS! I swear to you that I was challenged they would be some of the best I'd ever eaten... Well let me tell you if you just wanted to try a food that someone has truly mastered, I mean really, cannot get any better then they were, then order these. (You'll see a picture of them as well I posted in their photos). The breading is absolutely the precise amount, somewhere between Southern Fried thickness and Tempura style crispness. And furthermore, they are so tender you will wonder what in the world they do to them to get them this way... If you're a meat eater, think \"kobe\" tenders, that's what these are. : ) They are truly done that well! A test of all the willpower you have in your entire body would be to order these and just eat 1. Have fun and definitely try them when you go! : ) \n\n\nMy Final Thought... \n     Totally have fun and enjoy this restaurant! It's a great time, the people there are so friendly, and the experience you'll have there is one you'll never forget, no matter how many times you visit back. :D  \n\nEnjoy, \nHenry : ) \n\n\n\nP.S.\n\n\"If you're ever caught not listening to someone and called out for it, just respond by saying, \"Chocolate\"... at that point everything they were talking about becomes irrelevant and you've just surreptitiously avoided all confrontation that could have occurred.\" ~Henry"

The portions are large but not quite worth the price. \n\nSerendipity 3 is located right in the front street of ceasers palace. Its location is very central on the strip and cannot be easily missed when walking by. Reservations are easy online via opentable. No hassles there.\n\nOnce seated the waiter seemed nice. He was very polite but seemed rushed. Looking around this place is really busy. Its bustling and for my mid weekday visit the patio was full and the restaurant was filling up fast. \n\nPersonally I think you should stick to the frozen hot chocolates when you eat here. Its what they are known for and are really filling. Its basically a chocolate slushie. For $13 its good for sharing for 2 people. I almost always order one but can never finish it!\n\nIve had the mint chocolate, white chocolate and the regular chocolate. My favourite was the the regular out of all three. Ive found the added flavours made the dessert overwhelmingly sweet. I barely could down my white chocolate one bc it tasted like pure frozen sugar. It is the simple things that make some dosjes fabulous. Amd thats why this place is fabulous. The frozen hot chocolate is a must on every visit I make to the las vegas strip. Its something about frozen desserts in the dessert that are sooooo satisfying. After a long day of sightseeing this dessert is awesome.\n\nAs for the other items on the menu...well they are all fillers if you ask me. Just typical burgers or hot dogs or quick food which will fill you up and leave little to no impression on you. Ive had the kobe beef sliders which were 3 small sliders that were nothing fancier than your average mini burger. I minused a star bc it was just too plain. The fancy meat was just flat out boring. The accompaniments were boring too. It was so average I thought  who knew these big prices would lead to such plain boring food. \n\nPrice wise. Im sure there are better deals for desserts in vegas. $13 a pop for dessert is pretty pricy considering its mostly ice. So I minused a star for the inflated prices leaving a poor impression on me. My kobe beef sliders were boring and I would not order them again. So my advice....skip the food menu. And go straight for dessert!"

A touristy restaurant from NYC (land of ridiculous prices) lands on the Vegas strip (one of the most pricey and touristy places on earth), what did you expect? I have 0 sympathy for those that thought this overly cute place on the strip would be a place to get a good deal. It is what it is. A cute tourist trap that's fun to take the kids to (or kids at heart!). \n\nMy fiance and I dined at the bar - not wanting to endure the 30 minute wait on a Tuesday night or dine outside in the 109 degree weather. We met some lovely people and loved our dining experience. Margaritas were buy 1 get 1 free (grab a coupon from the pink hair chicks outside) and were pretty good tasting and relatively strong. Service was attentive. The atmosphere doesn't suit me much (all the pink and flowers), but it's cute if youre into that sort of thing.\n\nNow on to the food! Fiance had the shortrib pot pie and I had the ABC burger. The burger appeared to be on a pretzel like bun so i was disappointed to find sesame seeds and not salt on top (I'm a salt whore!). The burger was very tasty, but I wouldn't get it again. Next time I want a burger I'll stick to the burger specialty places on the strip (BLT, Strip Burger, Burger Bar) instead. Waffle fries were yummy. I'm rounding this up to 4 stars because my fiance adored his pot pie. Shortrib was awesome and the crust was flaky buttery goodness. \n\nI complained to the bartender I was too full to try the famous frozen hot chocolate so he made me a mini one for free! It was very tasty, but honestly if you order this you need to know you're drinking a freaking $10 milkshake. It's on the strip.. it's an experience.. it tastes good, but honestly I have yet to try a milkshake in my life that's worth $10. Being the alcoholic that I am.. I noticed they also have frozen hot chocolate concoctions with freaking booze in them! These were priced around $12 and seemed like a better deal (for some reason getting gauged on alcoholic drinks seems normal and totally ok!). Next time my eye is on one of those."

It was pretty disorganized with the clumps of people idling around, so you couldnt really make out the seating situation. Just as we were closing in on this one table for safety (totally ready to move if it was taken), this waitress comes out of nowhere and loudly barks at us, \"This table is for these folks over here! You have to go to the hostess to check in!\" And she does this terrific side eye. Wtf that's just what we were doing. We're irked, but okay we look for the hostess (again, he-llo crowds of people, disorganized main entrance/lobby area). Then the same waitress approaches, condescendingly leans in and points to the hostess with her finger, telling us loudly, \"There, the hostess is that woman over there. With the computer in front of her.\" We're so turned off at this point, so we just turned around in her face and exited. \n\nExcuse you, miss, people who come in your store may be tourists/travelers, but don't insult our intelligence just because we're new to the place. We've probably traveled much more than you and know more about the world. So yes, we DO know what a ~hostess~ actually looks like. So not worth eating here with this kind of \"service.\""

So I went back the next day around 9. The carry out section was closed even though there site says they open at 830; but it's actually only the restaurant that opens at 830, the carry out opens at 11.  Soooo,  I say to the hostess, the carry out doesn't open till 11, half the stuff on the menu is for breakfast and breakfast stops being served at 11, which means half the menu is inaccessible to customers.

The Safe at Home Kobe sliders were cooked way too much spoiling the potentially delicious meat.  The Spud-Ntks were inedible.  As for the Sundaes, they were passable.  As Serendipity's decline has begun, Monkey will look for other dessert places in the desert."

They have multiple TVs through out their restaurant, so you wont miss a beat. You can enjoy a great meal while catching your game that is either crucial to you as a fan, and as a fantasy football participant. They have tons to select from, whether you are hungry or just looking for a sugary treat to try. We did both, ordered a entree and ordered a dessert. For the entees we tried chicken and waffle, and chocolate chip pancakes. For the sugary treat we tried our first time experience with their mocha and white chocolate cold drinks. From the food to the drinks we tried, everything met our expectations, and with each bite we understood why they always had a line outside the door. This place is worth the wait, and the prices for the items are decent as well. Definitely a must try, when in town."

We ended up sharing a frozen hot chocolate to join the bandwagon of reviews AND their strawberry shortcake sundae. The frozen chocolate hits the spot if you're a chocolate lover on a hot day, but nothing too crazy. The strawberry shortcake sundae on the other hand, was massive! The cheesecake in the sundae made it too rich to eat the sundae in my opinion. I like cheesecake and I like strawberry shortcake, but together? Too intense. Too overwhelmed by the sugar overload, I didn't even notice it when I left my atm card behind after paying for our desserts. =/"

I'm not sure if this was because we are locals, we were ordering from Restaurant Week menu, or that was really the last and ONLY table. This process had already taken longer than necessary so we did not fight it. Since we knew what we wanted we ordered immediately, the mixed berry smoothie, cinnamon bun hot chocolate french toast, and the hangover omelette. We waited for around 20 minutes to get our smoothies and another 45 to get our meals. The omelette was luke-warm in the middle and the french toast was good but soggy.

I think little girls and women in general can appreciate the whimsical decor, but on the flipside I watched my husbands testosterone gain fairy wings and fly away leaving a trail of pixie dust. It's that kind of place. \n\nSeeing that we came here on a spontaneous dessert run, we didn't spend too much time looking at the food menu. The food on other people's plates looked good, albeit huge. The portions here are Cheesecake Factory sized.\n\nA little weary of what we saw size wise and the fact that there was a special 'cowards portion' on the menu we decided to go with that one. I am glad we did, since that was pretty large by itself. It was huge, sticky, sweet and delicious. \n\nWe paired our banana split with two glasses of water (with sex matching straws, pink and blue - butwhatifIidentifymyselfdifferently..) and an extra long session of people watching. If you come here make sure to get a table on the patio, the people watching in Vegas is prime and this is a great spot for it."

Our experience started off on the wrong foot when we were seated outside in a corner in the blazing sun when there was plenty of seating inside and outside that weren't in the sun. I asked if we can move to a table at least out of the sub and the hostess told us the rest of the tables were for bigger parties than 2.....shortly after we sat down the hostess brought parties of 2 to those tables that I asked about. I was disgusted at this type of treatment and after my meal I went to ask her.  She said that those tables had been reserved. I can definitely understand that but why didn't she say that in the beginning rather than say it's for bigger parties? She also had an aloof attitude that I didn't appreciate. I asked to speak to the manager and she offered to take 20% off the bill AFTER I had to ask for it some sort of rectification. I've always been impressed with the establishments on the Caesars property so I was surprised I was treated that way here. \n\nAs for the food it was decent but really overpriced.  You are paying for the novelty."

We dropped by here for a weekday lunch and it was tolerable. We were seated in the smallest 2-person booth ever and the server was a bit disinterested, but nice. In that, when she bought out coffee, she did not offer any milks or sugars, but when asked, she was like: Of course! And went to get the items. This was a recurring theme.\n\nWe shared a BBQ chicken pizza which was enough to fill our bellies. However, the flavor of the pizza was lacking. I asked for parmesan cheese and red chili flakes when the pizza was brought out (normally, those items are brought out as soon as you place your order). She came back with just the chili flakes. I wasn't even about to ask for Sriracha, since they probably didn't have it (they did not have sugar in the raw for our coffees). My hot water tasted weird.\n\nSo yeah, the dining-in experience was just eh and due to that I wasn't interested in ordering their famous frozen hot chocolate and having to endure sitting any longer. I ordered my frozen hot chocolate drink at their take-out window which was also another lacking experience, but by design, as it was a take-out window only. However it was also my mistake for getting the white chocolate version of the drink which was just kind of oily tasting. \n\nTheir restrooms are outside the restaurant past the take-out window and winding underneath the building. It kind of looked sketch, but the restrooms themselves were clean for being so public.\n\nJust a lacking visit, but I'm glad I'm no longer left wondering, so there's that!"

Located just off Las Vegas Blvd, right in front of Caesar's Palace, Serendipity offers an extensive menu comprised from delightful variations of traditional American dishes and desserts.  \n\nThe d\u00e9cor transmits a retro odds and ends type of style, channeling themes of Alice in Wonderland & Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.\n\nAfter walking up and down the strip under the blistering desert sun I was parched and in dire need of something refreshing. I took a quick gander at the mobile yelp app and I decided to check out Serendipity's infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate. \n\nI was quickly seated during the early afternoon (2pm Wednesday). My friend and I decided to share a Frozen Hot Chocolate for Two. We also desired something piquant that would enhance the sweetness of the chocolate, so we happily ordered a side of Sweet Potato Fries.   \n\nThe food was magnificent, simple and very delicious. The Frozen Hot Chocolate is essentially Nestl\u00e9's instant hot chocolate dry mix blended with ice and garnished with whip cream & bits of chocolate. For whatever reason I was anticipating a malty texture similar to a milk shake, boy was I wrong. The texture is something like a slush, very icy and rich, drinking it does not require much effort. (very sweet) \n\nThe chocolate and sweet potato fries complimented each other perfectly. (Something salty with something sweet). Maybe a little bit more salty than I would have liked, but still very delicious. \n\nSince we did not order anything too elaborate (due to the mixed yelp reviews) I glanced around the room to see what the other patrons had ordered. I noticed tea tray towers filled with dishes such as sandwiches and various types of finger foods, also very charming tableware brandishing the Serendipity name which occupied savory looking salads, pizzas, burgers, sundaes, ribs, cakes, deep fried oreos and everything else that screams America.  \n\nAll in all I had a really good experience here. This is definitely a cute place to come with your girlfriend or your wife & kids. I loved it I was in good company and it kept me out of the sun. \n\nWord of advice order a water.. you will need it! \n\nYour average dish here is between $10-$20\nAny dessert (preferably ice cream) can be topped with a selection of candies, nuts, and sauces for an additional $1/each. \n\nCheck them out at: http://www.caesarspalace.com/casinos/caesars-palace/restaurants-dining/serendipity-3-detail.html"

Armed with their own giant root beer float and fried Oreo sundae, none of my dining companions wanted to help me out. \n\nThe chocolate was good. But I am not sure if \"good\" is good enough to justify its fame. I don't foresee myself craving it anytime soon, and definitely cannot fathom how people would wait for hours in NYC for a table at Serendipity. If I want to go to a touristy spot that serves enormous ice cream dishes, I would go line up at Ghiradelli (another place that is strangely popular)."

But after reading other comments on Yelp, I was pretty skeptic (like all other reviews) because it's all relevant as what's good for you or not as everyone has different taste.  \n\nBut when the hostess and server doesn't really seem like they have any interest in serving you in anyway, I just want to get out ASAP.  I understand with a huge line that they must be tired or cranky as the line didn't seem to die down a bit but boy the look and the tone of voice they use were not friendly at all.  \n\nSo going back to the food, my friend and I ordered one sundae as I was told they were big, and it was pretty good as well as I love sweets.  But the deserts weren't anything mouth watering as it tasted similar to any sundaes I had.  For $15 bucks, I can't really say it was worth it.  \n\nNow, going back to the waiter who served me, at first he seemed super nice as when I asked about what he recommanded, he seemed very determined to help me.  It was when I was paying, he took my check and cash but when he gave it to me, just threw the check holder right front of my face...my friend looking all shocked.  So I took the change and since my seat was right next to the computer where he was working at, he just looked away doing something...no \"Have a great day,\"  or \"thanks, hope to see you soon..\" Nothing.  \n\nI get better service at any local teriyaki stores that has one server that does everything.  =P"

I was incredibly disappointed on various levels of my experience here.\n\nFirst, it had been raining the day we went and while we were seated in a nice area to get a view of the fountain it turned into a puddle as soon as the rains picked up again.  One would think that they would have asked us if we wanted to move to another table that wasn't being affected by the rain?  However, that wasn't the case at all.  Instead, a few of the servers came by and laid down additional towels to soak up the water while we tried to eat our food.  This not only presented a horrible smell but really, it could have been a potential risk to the restaurant should myself or someone in party happen to slip because of the water or towels.  \n\nSecond, the service.  Well, there was a lack of it to be honest.  While they were changing shifts the young lady laying down the towels began to complain about the fact that she always had the ethnic tables and upset that she had to work the side that was being damaged by the water and worse yet that she even had to work.  Mind you this was all in Spanish.  Low and behold, the \"sweet\" smile that came to fill our water glasses was the same young lady complaining in Spanish.  At this point, I was starting to become irritable.  I work in the retail and service industry, while I expect the best out of my staff, I usually expect the worse when going to a restaurant but this was starting to draw the line.\n\nFinally, the food.  We went for lunch and let me tell you, I could have had a better lunch at the local Denny's.  The food was soo below average.  We ordered the steak sandwich and hot dog.  I would only recommend eating a real meal at any other place and then coming here for desert.  The food here was so lack luster.

It's a limited menu but again, we were there strictly for dessert.\n\nWe were in line for 45 minutes.  I don't understand why there was a long wait when the orders consisted of ice cream.  I passed on the frozen hot chocolate - why do I need to spend $15 on a milkshake?  I went with the huge chocolate donut and the Forbidden Sundae which consisted of chocolate cake, chocolate and vanilla cream, whip cream, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top.  I waited another 15 minutes for my order to be prepared.  I saw my sundae sitting on the counter underneath an air vent that was melting my ice cream. It took another 10 minutes for the server to grab my donut.  By the time I was handed my sundae, the whip cream turned into milk and spilled over the cheesy cup.  The cake was hard and chewy.  The ice cream underneath and had already turned into mush.  It was the MESSIEST sundae I have ever dealt with.  It was sooo messy, that it got me angry and I just wanted to throw it away! The donut was nothing special....just  big.\n\nThis was the worst experience ever! Everyone wants to eat here because of the movie; well, I'm hear to tell you that the service and food is below standard!  WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!  If you want real ice cream, come over to the bay area and hit up MITCHELL'S!  Mitchell's is worth standing in line for!"

I read a few other reviews about it being slow and hard to get a table but we were greeted as soon as we walked in and got seated immediately.  Our waitress was attentive and the food came out fast.\n\nWe got the Peanut butter frozen hot chocolate for two ($15) which was insanely good.  The hot chocolate was tasty but as soon as you sucked up the chunks of peanut butter, the flavor-meter went through the roof.  I highly recommend it.  \n\nWe also go the Crab Artichoke Dip ($12) and the Summer Bries sandwich ($16).  The dip was really tasty with big chunks of crab.  The only downside was the bread was kind of too hard.  Softer bread would have been better.  The sandwich was tasty with a large mound of turkey.  It was enough for two.  We saw another table with a fettuccine pasta dish that looked very tasty.  Will probably try that next time we go.\n\nIn total we spent $56 which was pretty good considering the quality of the food.  I'll definitely go back to this place next time I'm in vegas."

I decided to get the 32oz for $15 since our sweet tooth was really buggin' out.  What I got was instant hot chocolate powder blended with milk and ice, which I could have made myself for about $0.75.  \n\nI don't know how good the food is but based on one of their signature dessert items, this place is a joke.  Do yourself a favor and grab an ice-blended mocha from the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf at Lake Mead and Tenaya, that's what frozen hot chocolate should taste like."

Asked for bloody mary to not be too spicy and I was blowing flames with mine.  Frozen hot chocolate ( which is what they are known for) was completely watery and disappointing.  I wanted huevos rancheros but with flour tortilla instead of tostada and was told \"no\".  So I ordered the breakfast quesadilla but with an overeasy egg.  Mauricio came out and told me that they couldn't do it with the egg in it that they could only put the egg on the side.  I was completely baffled by this but agreed.  Overall not impressed!!!!"

The egg white was a bit hardened and the outside of the egg was kinda soggy.\n\nChocolate French Toast - Not a big fan of chocolate, but I'm a fan of french toast. Sweeeeeeeeetttttt.

Our server, Jason was amazing and so attentive. I also loved the atmosphere with its chic decor and great music. However, other than the delicious frozen hot chocolate, the food was mediocre at best. In fact, the soup was pretty bad and I do not recommend getting the omelet or the sweet potato fries. If you're just looking for a good dessert it's a great place to go, but I'd recommend trying another spot for an actual meal."

The link is to be determined as my other party members were ok.\n\nThe wait for non-reservations was an hour to an hour and a half, steady, and that was at 9 PM. We made a reservation in advance, but they jotted us down for two instead of four. They corrected it quickly and sat our party efficiently. \n\nOur waiter started off as nice. He brought waters without our asking and came by timely the get our order. Then when we weren't ready and told him, a few more minutes, he multiplied that by a factor of three.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had the chicken pot pie and sweet potato fries. My friend had pasta and a frozen hot white chocolate milk. His girlfriend got a chicken salad. Instead they brought her a crab cake salad. She had to go through the hostess to get the waiter as he essentially disappeared. He argued with her about what she ordered then took it back and brought the correct dish about five plus minutes later. They never brought her a new fork and since service was so evasive, it was hard to flag anybody. I gave her mine.\n\nThe food was mixed. The frozen hot chocolate tasted good, but boy are those expensive. My friends girlfriend said the chicken didn't taste right. The pot pie was good. The fries were sweet but got cold very quickly.  I don't know if the pot pie made me ill or not. \n\nThe waiter came by and asked if we wanted dessert menus. We said sure and I told him I didn't like the fries. He asked if I wanted something different. I said no and he said he'd remove them from the bill.\n\nAbout ten minutes plus goes by. He comes back to our table and asks us if we want to see the dessert menus. My friends girlfriend says he asked that fifteen minutes ago but never brought them. He rolled his eyes and gave us our check.  He rung up our cards quickly and we got out of there.\n\nThe breakdown:\nFood: 2.5 stars\nService: 2.5 stars\nAtmosphere: 4 stars"

They only take RSVP 2 hrs. in advance at the earliest.  It was very windy the day my group and I went & everyone who waits, has to wait outside.  There was only 1 heat lamp next to the outdoor hostess (which you're not able to stand next to, but that doesn't matter b/c you can barely feel the heat since there is a tube around the stream of fire - probably for the drunkards who might decide to actually touch the flame).  \n\nANYWAYS,  once we got seated indoors, the atmosphere seemed very open and whimsical-like.  The menus were HUGE & I was having a hard time trying to decide on what to chow down on.  Our waiter helped me with that and I went with the Crab Cake Burger.  Once it arrived it looked AMAZING and it tasted just that.  It came with a side of fries (I ordered steak) & a really yummy dipping sauce.  The burger came with arugula and bacon, too!  YUM!  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough room for the Frozen Hot Chocolate :/  But I did manage to try a spoonful from my friend and it just reminded me of chocolate ice cream or chocolate ensure.  EH.  However, I'm willing to give the frozen hot chocolate another try... one day.  I would definitely come back for their Crab Cake Burger though!  \n\nFood my friends ordered - The Hangover Omelet (HUGE), The Sliders (comes w/ 3 of them & they look like nothing, but they apparently filled her up, but she had to order a side of fries), The Grilled Cheese which came with a side of tomato soup w/ goldfish sprinkled on top - cute (she said the sandwich was REALLY GOOD), and The Chicken Strips (comes w/ 3 dipping sauces).\n\nThe food IS on the pricey side, but the portions are huge."

Complete disappointment!!!! Guys.. It's rare that I get this mad over food.. But we literally sat down and waited 20 mins for a server to come by and ask what we'd like to drink.. (And she wasn't even our server for the section!) this girl who we finally were able to wave down.. Had said she would go get our server... 10 mins later.. She came back and said \"you still haven't been helped?\" And decided to just help us.. We over heard her asking another server where the server for our table was... That right there... Biiiig red flag for bad experience waiting to happen.. \n\nAnyway. We finally got to order.. We decided to share the steak sandwich.. That I see everyone getting... And the frozen hot chocolate as dessert... After ordering we waited what seemed like forever for our food to come out.. They bring us.. The frozen hot chocolate first.. (That's dessert.. What in the world?!) at this point I was so hungry I didn't care anymore., we downed that frozen hot chocolate in less then 5 mins! Our steak sandwich finally came out.. It's really big.. So plan on sharing. But after reading this.. Hopefully you don't even bother to waste your money! This steak sandwich is served on a long baguette that is cut in half.. Then it has two pieces of steak, bacon and an over easy egg on top. Now.. If you the plate looks pretty darn good. But when you eat it.. Your opinion will go south pretty quick! It was like biting into rubber! We couldn't even bite the sandwich. The baguette was hard as a rock.. And the steak was so chewy and rubber.. It was ridiculous.. We had to start using a knife to cut it into small pieces just to eat... And not only that.. We asked for a Medium well steak... My piece came out MOO-ing to me! It was so bloody.. I felt like a vampire .. The blood started dripping and made my bread look all bloody.. I couldn't even eat it! My bf had to switch with me cause his piece was actually cooked correctly.. Ugh! Such a bad experience...\n\nThe service here is horrible.. If you read a review on bad service.. It's cause it is! They run around looking so busy.. But I seriously don't see them doing anything.. And the food here is just plain horrible! Forgot to mention this is my 3rd time here... Everytime their food just gets more & more disappointing... STICK TO DESSERT HERE! It's also super pricey! The steak sandwich and frozen hot chocolate came out to be $40.. Nooooo thank you! Never coming back again!! \n\n\n*quick tip..if you must.. Just order the frozen hot chocolate to go.. Don't waste your time in the restaurant!*"

We did have to wait like 45 minutes for a table and about 20 minutes for an order of onion rings but considering this everything was just perfectly sub par.\n\nWith all of the hype surrounding this popular NY/LV eatery my friends and I just haddd to go there. After the 45 minute wait we finally were sat down and the one person who had been there and was dying for their waffle fries asked where it went on the menu. He LAUGHED and said they don't serve them anymore. (liiil rude esp since he just had gotten started as our server).\n\nAnyhoo we ordered the onion rings. They took a good 20 minutes to come out and uhhh they tasted like onion rings. It's cute how everybody thinks something is so amazing off of a gimmick such as making it into a tower, but try putting them on a plate y'all. They're plain cheese dusted onion rings.\n\nEntrees: no one was particularly blown away by anything in particular. I did like my chicken pot pie but the flavor was nothing different than one I could have gotten out of the frozen food section. (maybe hit it up with some herbs?) my friend did like and actually finish her summer bries sandwich and the other 2 girls liked their burgers but our last friends veggie burger got a great big ol YUCKO all around. It was house made/some non boca burger version which we appreciated but the gratitude ends there. It tasted like it was made from chopped up al dente garbanzo beans (al dente garbanzos are not looked upon highly in the bean world) and just flat out had no flavor. Even the massive chunk of avocado couldn't save it. She wept.\n\nAfter the tears were gone we tried to alleviate her pain with their faaaamous frozen hot chocolate. To our servers dismay we split the single serving between 5 girls. We received the whip cream tower that was the frozen hot chocolate and dug in. It was perfectly boring. Every single person that raved about this dessert needs to go out and have an actual decadent chocolate dessert experience. Only then will you understand how terribly non chocolatey and boring this rip off of a dessert was. It made us reminisce to the rich thick mousse like creaminess that was cravings @ mirage's chocolate pudding. We all wept. \n\nOverall it was okay but I'd def want to try any and every other restaurant on the strip before I came back."

Their selling point is their \"Frozen Hot Chocolate\", which looked way too big and a waste of calories drinking down what essentially seems like a chocolate milkshake to me.  So while it looked appealing, it was 8:30 pm at night and my friends & I were just looking for dinner at that point.  \n\nThere was absolutely no space that night (Sunday night) and so they suggested we ordered in their outside stand.  We therefore proceeded to do that and by the time we got there, they sold NOTHING.  There were no hotdogs, no sandwiches, no salads, no anything.  Anything we asked for on the menu, they said, \"we don't have it\".  Finally, frustrated, we ordered a bbq chicken pizza and some nachos.  Everything was just average.  The pizza actually had way too much bbq sauce it was a bit overbearing and the crust was way too doughy.  The nachos were just drizzled in cheese whiz and something I could have totally made myself.  \n\nI'm now looking at their real restaurant menu and it appears as though they may have more variety inside the shop.  Maybe I'd give it another try the next time I go to Vegas, but likely not as there are lots of other good things to eat in Vegas.  \n\nThe restaurant itself looked pretty cute...lots of Hello Kitty."

It reminded me of a high school cafeteria. I was with two other people who have also been to the one in New York and we all agreed that, that serendipity felt cozy and comfortable. The food was great, but they could have replicated the New York set up and it would have been more enjoyable. I was also upset when I found out that the gum ball  fish tank was gone. I really wanted to see it as I am an aquarium hobbyist.   Our waiter was charming and he explained to me why they had to remove it."

When we first arrived, I was immediately taken away by the d\u00e9cor, very whimsical at first but then you notice that a couple of the pieces just don't belong. Think Alice in Wonderland meets Hello Kitty, with a touch of a college sports fan...yeah. The restaurant is not very big inside, but there is a nice wrap around patio that actually has more seating than what is  offered inside.  This worked out perfect for us as it was a gorgeous day. While waiting to be seated we checked out the menu. Not impressed. With the exception of omelets, nothing brunchy about this place. Typical American fare. We considered leaving when our buzzer went off to be seated. Our host decided to seat several parties at once, I get what she was doing- but she did not execute it properly. For starters, we had the nachos- AWESOME. And between the 3 of us, we ordered a veggie burger, the crab cake sandwich, and the buffalo pizza. EVERYTHING was fantastic!!!! Best buffalo pizza I have ever had! I know there are a couple of these around the country (NY, Miami, DC) I would most definitely go again!!!!"

Waited around for about 10 minutes then got buzzed and seated. The place was totally NOT packed. There were probably 5 open tables and no one being seated. A few of the tables still had a bunch of trash on and i didn't see anyone going to clean it. \n\nOnce we were seated we took a look at the menu. We decided to just stick with water for our drinks since we were getting a sundae. We opted for the Jackpot Sundae at 14 bucks because it was a combo of chocolate (which my boyfriend likes) and strawberry (which I like). \n\nWaited waited waited. It literally took them 15 to 20 minutes to come to us and they never even took our drink orders yet. We were seriously on the verge of leaving. There was a table of 3 next to us that came in 10 minutes after we did and we could tell they were waiting too. We decided that if they took their orders first, we were just going to up and leave.Tthey didn't, so they got us to stay for a while longer, but they did take their order RIGHT AFTER ours. \n\nWe were never asked if we needed anything or how we were doing, the waitress never even refilled our waters. \n\nWe waited about 20 more minutes for the sundae. It was freakin' ridiculous! I have a feeling they must be like this all the time. We noticed 4 cups of french fries in the kitchen that was just sitting there for 10 minutes, I hope they don't just give that to people when it gets ordered. \n\nThe sundae finally came. Half melted. Of course, they brought out everyone else's order at the same time. Are they really that lazy? They just had to wait to finish everyone's order from different tables to bring it out at the same time instead of making a few trips? The sundae's were seriously dripping because they must've been sitting and melting for a while. \n\nThe only thing they managed to bring in a very speedy manner was the check, of course. She pretty much gave that to us right after she handed over the sundae. So annoying. I should've ordered a soda or something just so she'd have to take it back and change it. \n\nThe sundae was good, but it definitely doesn't make up for the horrendous service. It sucks that they have such an awesome location and awesome theme, but the service just ruins it all. They should really be more selective with their staff, I honestly don't know what they were thinking. \n\nI am NOT coming back."

We also opted to sit indoors, because despite their fans outside, I was not about to sit in the 105 degree weather.\n\nTheir brunch menu looked pretty amazing.. super tasty breakfast items, and some super tasty lunch items. We decided to mix a little of both and ordered the french toast log and a cheeseburger to share among the 3 of us. When the french toast arrived, we were in awe. It was definitely a LOG, and it was huge! On one end were some breakfast potatoes and 2 sunny side eggs with bacon, and on the other end were some fresh berries with whipped cream. It was definitely a true breakfast meal! The cheeseburger was very good too. Everything was super tasty, but we were really waiting for the frrrrozen hot chocolate at the end! We got a coupon for a free one with our stay at Paris, so that just made it extra delicous. Nothing beats that cool dessert on a hot Vegas day! The bill only came out to $32!!"

I got the grilled cheese and tomato soup.\n\nNow, I am not a fan of the tomato in general, so don't ask why I got the tomato soup, but I don't regret!! That was some of the best soup I have ever consumed, we've spent the past year and a half attempting to duplicate it, but was never able to!! The serving size is pretty big too.\n\nSo lets get to the real why we went to this place, the desserts. We couldn't decide so we asked for a recommendation. Fried Oreo Sundae!!! It was SOOOOOO good, and sooo gluttoness. We probably cracked half of it, after awhile, it just wasn't possible to continue.\n\nThis place was great :) Will definitely return next time I'm in Vegas."

Soooo yeah. \n\nWe showed up to wait for a table (mind you there are about 45 tables open outside and we were okay with eating outside). The hostess said it would be a 15 minute wait anyway (why? I don't know). So we're sitting outside by the door and near a fan. We've been waiting for a while and I get up to go check to see if they called our name. Apparently the hostess did (inside? she knew we were outside) and since we weren't there crossed us off the list and moved us to the bottom. She was also very rude to us about it. \n\nWhatever, no big deal. I'll take your attitude, just seat me, I'm starving. \n\nFinally after waiting for a few minutes (this time I stood near their hostess station so they knew I was in existence) and my party was seated. Naturally it was uncomfortably hot but we were seated in probably the worst area. It was so hot, I was disgustingly (and embarrassingly) taking ice out of my drink and letting it melt on my legs. :hangs head in shame:\n\nOur waiter was very nice and made up for the hostess. I wanted lunch and asked for something \"small.\" Apparently their tuna salad was the smallest salad but this thing was massive!!! It was very good, but I'm still cautious about getting fish in the middle of the desert. \n\nAnyway, no dessert. I think if I was back in Vegas and wasty face, I'd make a stop to try the dessert. Otherwise, I probably could get bitched at by a hostess at a snootier restaurant and feel less bad about it."

Not worth the wait- nor the price at about $17 a sandwich! I only ate half of the gross sandwich because I was starving. After leaving, my husband and I were still left wondering why so many people loved this place, and since there was a lot of hype about their frozen hot chocolates, we agreed we would visit once more just to try their dessert, and hoped we would get better service the second time around. We came back the same night at about 11, this time we waited at the order window rather than a table inside. After waiting 40 minutes (they are awfully slow!!!)

We saw people at the pick up line waiting 15 minutes AFTER they put in their order for their drinks, and they were all in small cups. $16 for a small plastic cup of frozen hot chocolate and an hour of wait time?! No thanks! I am wondering WHY people choose to wait here, with all the delicious cafe's along the strip, it is just not worth it. Don't waste your time here."

Just about right. However, the staff were telling me that they will be permanenly closed this January. So, anyone want to have a taste of it, you better go now.\n\nFood is good, though, i do think it's a little pricey. $15 for grill foot long hotdog. Omelet is between $15-$20. Pepsi $5. Worth it? Maybe it's just Vegas pricing."

I ordered the buffet sandwich which was ok, it really was massively large.  My wife had the brie open faced sandwich which again was excellent, it included stuffing and cranberry mayo.   Our friends ordered a Caesar salad which was also large and had massive croutons.   My other friend ordered a turkey club which was incredibly massive!   \n\nAll of the food was excellent and presented nicely.   The best thing here however was the frozen hot chocolate.   I am not even the biggest fan of hot chocolate or chocolate in general but that was some really good stuff.   I could drink that all day...amazing."

What do you want now\" attitude no matter what you ask. I get how they must be getting a lot of drunk tourists, but we were not even drunk. Yet we made the bad decision of ordering two huge sundaes and a piece of cake ;), go figure! The desserts are huge, the slice of red velvet cake was humongous!! You could easily split it with two other people. So the $14 price tag is quite alright given the sheer size of that thing. Same with the sundaes, you wont be disappointed with the food at all. If you are a little buzzed, your experience might just be a little better since you wont care about the service and wont likely feel guilty to chow down the giant desserts"

It is crazy that they charge $20 for a basic cheese burger with a side of fries. I get that this place is on the strip in front of Caesars, but to charge these prices is absolutely crazy. For 5 of us to eat there the bill was $205 with the tip. I can get the same food at a red robin or similar place. No one had anything fancy 2 cheese burgers, grilled cheese with tomato soup, chicken sandwich, 2 beers, 1 frozen hot chocolate and deep fried Oreos with some ice cream. Again the staff was great we had a really cool waiter that had a great personality. The issue is with their prices for some average bar food that you can get anywhere around town for much less. I don't see myself going back to this place and would not recommend it to anyone."

The lady told us 20-30 minutes! Like are you kidding me? There's no one even outside and its freakin 105 degrees that makes me grumpy. \n\nFinally 30 minutes later we get seated. I eye balled the frozen hot chocolate but the strawberry supreme was more appealing to me! And it was really good.. I didn't pay much attention to the customer service because I was too tired and too hot to even pay attention or care. I just wanted to cool down! \n\nI would come back but I hope I don't ever have to wait that long to be seated when there isn't even that many people sitting down."

Being a little quirky about my meals - I skipped past the crazy waffle concoctions and discovered a shrimp and asparagus frittata served with a green salad on top?  Really?  Could it get any more perfect for me?  Everyone at the table ordered something different - banana waffles, eggs benedict, breakfast quesadilla and everyone was very happy.  The portions are massive - so be prepared and come with an appetite or bring home leftovers.  I LOVED my frittata.  I think egg whites are a waste and asked if it could be made with the whole eggs, which is not a problem.  When the food arrived it all looked so pretty.  I was delighted with my frittata.  The salad on top was fresh and the dressing flavorful.  The frittata itself was full of big pieces of asparagus and shrimp... and had some asparagus and shrimp on top.  VERY filling.  Very good.  I was stuffed until dinner... and even then, could barely eat.  We also had a coupon for a free 10 oz. frozen hot chocolate.  This was a total score!  Plenty for two and very rich.  If you're a chocolate person - this is not to be missed.  Even without a coupon, I would get this to share with someone... worth the money for a very sweet treat.  The service was good.  Drinks were never empty.  Food was timely as was follow-up.  We weren't hassled about our freebie coupons (in fact, she didn't even pick them up with the bill!)... All in all a very pleasant dining experience with friends.  I'd definitely like to come back to try lunch... by the time we left, the lunch orders were coming out and those nachos looked darn good!"

My 12 yr old and her friends loved their frozen hot chocolates but didn't finish them because it was too sweet and a bit pricey. My second experience was not a good experience at all. If it wasn't my hubby's friends who wanted to try this restaurant, I would've pick somewhere else. The place was dirty and it seemed like the staff didn't really like working there. My friend had ask to have her burger cut in half when she placed the order and was not cut so when the food came she told the waiter that she asked to have the burger cut in half. The waiter rudely said he'll get a knife (his demeanor was so rude like we were asking for the world), also same waiter, when he came to bring my order which was the worst pasta I've ever tasted (shrimp pesto pasta $20), he handed the plate to me and said it's hot. Yes, it was very hot since he had a  linen cloth to hold the plate and I didn't. It seemed like it just came out from the microwave oven. My pasta was not good at all, I wanted to throw up and not \"fresh\" like it said on the menu. Yes, I should've known, it's a desert place, but I was hungry and it was dinner time and didn't want the pizza or burger. So I ended up taking some of my hubby's cheeseburger which was good. I should've changed my order to something else but didn't want my food to get spit at. Anyway, if you come to experience this place, I suggest only order the frozen hot chocolates since it's what they're famous for and the cheeseburger."

The lines are long and the prices high. But if you are able to get a table on the Strip-facing patio, it's a great place to people watch! This alone makes it worth all the other crap. You're up high enough from the street that you can harass people without fear of repercussion -- the other comparable Strip-side patio, at Mon Ami Gabi, is a little too within striking distance of the hoi polloi for my taste.\n\nFoodwise, I had nachos and an alcoholic root beer float. Both were great, though not groundbreaking. I refused to try the frrrozen hot chocolate because, as mentioned, anything that needs to be pimped out THAT hardcore probably sucks!!!\n\nSummary: worth it for the excellent people watching...just make a reservation or check in at the hostess stand WAY in advance!

It's probably because I'm so in love with the movie Serendipity... :-) \n\nThe wait for Serendipity is always very long, but it's less ridiculous if you agree to sit outside. During late winter/early spring, sitting outside is quite chilly though not uncomfortable with all the heat lamps. I loved the frozen hot chocolate which was quite unique. You can share a small frozen hot chocolate amongst three girls--it's that big. Also, the mushroom quiche with fresh greens on top was amazing and very filling, and can be shared amongst two people. I would definitely go back but try to go earlier in the morning to beat the touristy crowds."

Thinking it would be a bit on the sweet side, I ordered a pot of tea to share, also. It took forever for the drinks to come out, and it was quite comical when they ran out of tea pots and had to scramble for it. The frozen hot chocolate sucked. It was too watered down and half of it was whipped cream. For around 25 bucks total, I would much rather get drunk on something from Fat Tuesday or gamble some more (and get free drinks + tip) than drink a crap \"hot chocolate\" and stay sober...Never again."

One was their trademark frozen hot chocolate and the other was a cookie sundae.  Both were massive.  The sundae was easily big enough for three to share, possibly four.  But, if you have a sweet tooth, this was not a bad way to go.  It  was loaded with fudge, three types but f cookies, and whipped cream.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate was just that.  It tasted like what you would expect hot chocolate to taste like frozen.   Not quite the same treat as the sundae. I would have gladly taken a Wendy's frosty over that."

Having never tried it straight from Serendipity's I didn't know what to expect but according to them it definitely tastes the same.  I thought it tasted pretty good but yes, it did sort of remind me of a frosty from Wendy's-- a sort of gourmet version of it.  It still hope to try it here or in NY one day, but as many of the reviews have noted---if you don't want to wait long, get the mix and make it anytime you want.  Wait time is only as long as it takes you to whip it up in the blender.  I mean if it taste the same as buying it directly from them why not?! They even sell it at Williams Sonoma."

Hostess wasn't as nice, and got seated by the door inside. Since we're inside and by the door, every time somebody opens the door, you get really cold. A few tables opened up. I went to the hostesses inside, and they ignored me for a good 3 minutes because they were busy gossiping. After I finally got their attention, they said they can't transfer me to another table once I'm already seated. Even though I was annoyed by the impoliteness of the hostesses inside and outside, I tried to go on with my dinner. \n   Our server (White male) was nice, and gave some recommendations on how to eat our meal. Another server (Asian male) was also nice enough to talk to us and gave recommendations. The food is off the New Year's Eve menu so it is not regularly served there. Their bacon gruyere Mac cheese sticks is awesome, but the onion rings with it is sub par. I had the seafood risotto, which was excellent; I was bummed I didn't finish it because I was too full. My boyfriend's prime rib was juicy and tender. We were too full for sundae so we got the molten chocolate cake, which was delicious. Boyfriend and I were both happy. NYE meal came up to $100 excluding tip. \n\nREGULAR DAY - 1 star\n   I went here again because I was bummed that I was too full to try their famous Can't Say No Sundae, which is not available in their take-out section. I made reservations via OpenTable/Yelp. I got there on time, and I was told to wait. The hostess was impolite and dressed like she's going to workout. I am surprised because that's the first time I was asked to wait when I have a reservation. After 10 minutes of waiting, she had me sit outside. I thought I would get priority of getting seated inside since I made a reservation. I also thought their heater is on since it's getting cold already but it wasn't on. The server was ok, but I didn't like how the server and the hostess fought in front of us because the hostess is having a big party sit in a table the hostess is not done fixing yet. I thought the table is clean; it just needs utensils. Why don't the hostess get it since all she does is stand and look like a snob dressed in sweats anyway. The server was not also being professional in sort of shouting at the hostess. She should've pulled her aside, and talked to her; not announce to all the customers that they're a mess. Ok, so service is bad on regular days. Got it. \n   So the food finally came after waiting too long. The CRAB ARTICHOKE DIP is not good; I forced myself to eat it since I'm hungry and we paid $13 for it. My boyfriend's LAS VEGAS PHILLY CHEESE STEAK SANDWICH ($22) was delicious; hence, my 1 star. Then after a while, we had the CAN'T SAY NO SUNDAE. It's not as awesome as the hype goes. It tastes like regular drugstore sundae. The cake in it was not as good; tastes like cake you'd get in the grocery store. The ice cream itself is just regular ice cream. I would've been better off getting gelato. I was disappointed. \n   Even if I live in Vegas, I won't go out of my way now just to eat here, considering there's a ton of places to eat here. \n\n\nMy recommendation: DO NOT EAT INSIDE the restaurant, unless they have a holiday menu. JUST GO TO THEIR TO-GO SECTION OUTSIDE. They also have sundaes there as well as their famous frozen hot chocolate. All the Yelp reviews are right; service is horrible."

Caesars Palace has always been one of my favorite Casinos/Hotels but it looks like they crammed every square foot of there lot outside with a variety of bars, kiosks, eateries & so on.

A few people at my work were headed to Caesar's Palace's Cheesecake Factory when someone suggested we try Serendipity 3 instead. Because we were on The Strip, I knew that we would be treated like tourists and pay tourists prices. No shocker there:-) \n\nI was pleasantly surprised that our group was seated right away in their patio area. Our waiter was pleasant and even joked around with us a bit. He was quick with drink orders and recommendations on the menu. \n\nThe menu was extensive. There were plenty of food options as well as a ton of choices for desserts. We were there for dinner, and I wasn't feeling all that hungry, and I asked the waiter what he'd recommend; he stated that The Vegas Dog was one of his favorite items. I went with that. \n\nThe Vegas Dog is a foot-long hotdog with nacho cheese and jalape\u00f1os. When the dog came out, I was surprised by the awkward shape of the dish that seemed to reach the middle of the table and disturb my fellow diners. This thing is so massive that picking it up and eating it with your hands would have been challenging! I forked and knifed it. The bun to meat ratio was way off. Towards the middle of the meal, I got sick of how much bread there was and decided to eat just the dog from there on out. Although the meat was cooked thoroughly and there was a good amount of cheese on top, I couldn't get over the canned jalape\u00f1os. There were only a few slices of jalape\u00f1os, and it was surprised to learn that for $17 you weren't getting a freshly chopped topping. The taste of the peppers was mild and soggy. Also, the meat isn't flavored well. Besides the shear size of the dog, it tasted like any basic-brand hotdog you can find in your local grocery store. I would stick to Hebrew National or even BallPark Franks if you want some flavor in the meat. \n\nAs a local, I was glad to have good service at a tourist restaurant, but if I do return to this place, I'll be sure to stick with ice cream."

Food and drinks came out in reasonable time.  (We were in and out in under an hour.)  I mentioned a nut allergy, and there were no problems.

The desserts are verrry good. Serendipity is also a novelty so I had to check it out (saw the $1,000 sundae on TV one day- stupid expensive for a freaking sundae). I tried to go to the one in NY and the wait was too long. We came at a bit of an off time time I believe around 3 so my husband and I didn't have to wait long for a table for two.\nI wouldn't go back now that I have finally tried it, but I might check out the NY one one day."

Right off the bat, people talk about the service here,  so I will write about that first. \nThe service is fairly lousy.  But, I am guessing that they are constantly beyond busy, that something has to suffer a bit....and it's certainly not the food.  We did have to wait the two times we vistied Serendipity3 during our stay.  The girls taking your name down act more like bouncers than friendly hostesses.  They are not friendly or nice at all.  Both times we went they treated us poorly.  The first time, we had just gotten married and I was in a wedding dress.  Still, not so much as a congratulation....they looked at us and rolled their eyes.  So, they girls at the front are not sweet, nice or friendly. \nOnce you get passed all that and are actually allowed to sit in this confectionary heaven, you will quickly forget the teeny bopper hostesses and dream about your order.  \nI ordered a blueberry mojito, which was beyond delicious.  I will seriously dream about that drink....not too sweet....very fresh, with muddled mint and fresh blueberries throughout.  \nWe ordered the buffalo chicken wings.......also fantastic.  Not too hot, just a good amount of spice...and fried first, so they are a little crispy.  Perfect! \nWe had the Summer sandwich, with the pumpernickel raisen bread, cranberry mayo, turkey breast, apple slices, melted brie and topped with sprouts......sooooooooooooooooooooo yummy!   \nFor dessert, we had the chocolate cake...which I think was called forbidden chocolate cake sundae.  Gorgeous chocolate cake with a ganache frosting, vanilla and chocolate icecream, miles of homemade whip cream, chocolate shavings and a cherry on top.  It was huge, incredible, not too sweet, but ulta indulgent.  Just pure dessert heaven. \nWe also ordered a frozen hot chocolate.  We had to try it.  It was very good........again, not too sweet.  It sort of tasted like a hot chocolate slurpee with whip cream.   It doesn't taste like a chocolate slurpee, but more like swiss miss frozen.........That doesn't really do it justice, but the flavor is unique and quite scrumptious! \n\ni would go back in a heartbeat.  Who cares about the wait.  There is a wait everywhere in Vegas.  The food is what you are there for and it's all crazy good.  You won't be disappointed...........you'll dream about the next time you can go!!!!"

The service was slow (took hours to get seated and get food), they were telling us that there was no seating and the wait would be an hour even tho the inside was half empty and the outside had several open tables, once seated the waitress was never around, the food was bland (had the breakfast quesadilla which had no flavor and the chicken and waffles which was very greasy), the value wasn't worth the price ($50), and to top it off my sister and I both got food poisoning! We spent our last day in Vegas in the bathroom and laying on random benches because we had already checked out of our hotel and didn't feel well enough to do anything. It's been 2 days and I still feel nauseous from the chicken. \n\nAnother thing that put me off is that an owner or someone looking to start another location was sitting next to us. The staff was too busy catering to them that the customers were neglected. We arrived and ordered before them but yet they received multiple desserts, appetizers, entrees and cake (of which they would take 1 bite and throw away) before our meal ever arrived. If I was an owner I would want my customers to be well taken care of because that means repeat business. \n\nAlso this restaurant does not have a bathroom. You have to use the public restroom outside the building which was extremely nasty. Very poor dining experience. However, this place might be okay for the dessert only."

I mean honestly, who the hell can imagine a \"Frozen\" hot chocolate?\n\nAnd then you remember there are things such as fried ice cream in this world, as well as the insane level of heat in the Vegas dessert that makes all of these preconceived notions go away.\n\nAlas, Serendipity has helped me combat my drunken state with some very tasty desserts.  The actual restaurant inside looks far too expensive for what you get, but the express booth outside will do just fine.  Clearly the most popular item here are these frozen hot chocolates, which is mostly an iced chocolate smoothie to soothe your dehydrated self.\n\nIt'll set you back about $10, but I'd say it's worth it!  The chocolate goodness of the drink definitely cools you down, at least long enough for you to head into one of the air conditioned casinos.  Don't forget to also order a side of fries.  Ice cream goes SO well with frozen desserts such as this, and you can't hate it til you've tried it.\n\nThe only gripe I have about Serendipity's express-lane is that it's also another contradiction... the wait is LONG!  You're looking at a 30 minute wait as it is before getting your order in, even when the line seems short.  Then you're expected to wait another 10-15 minutes before the actual drink comes out.  A bit ridiculous if you ask me.\n\nBut despite it all, I'm sure I'll be sipping on another one of these again soon.  Note for next time- grab some kahlua or bailey's and mix it into the drink.  Get twice the fun!"

Last year I remember when we went to the express window, they had two sizes of the frozen hot chocolates; regular and large.  I think the regular was around $8 maybe and when I went recently, I couldn't believe how expensive they've gotten!  Now at the express window they charge $11 for the smaller size!!  They don't have large anymore; just one tiny cup of frozen hot chocolate at a ridiculous price.  I don't remember ever buying a single serving size drink for $11 before...just CRAZY.  \n\nAnyways we've eaten here before too and food is nothing special but I do admit, the frozen hot chocolate is really good.  We tried the strawberry this year and I think that one's my new favorite....SO GOOD.  We usually just do the express window because dining in takes so long.  I don't know why the wait is always forever and the hostesses are all grumpy from being constantly busy.  I also came in to buy a package of the frozen hot chocolate mix for $6...and really, I'm pretty sure the mix is just your typical hot chocolate powder.  I'm gonna try making this frozen hot chocolate with just regular hot chocolate mix and see how it goes.  \n\nBottom Line: Love the frozen hot chocolate, hate the price."

At first we wanted to eat inside but it was such a cluster trying to figure out who to see about a table, who was waiting to be seated, who was waiting just to leave their name for a seat. I realize that Saturday nights on the Vegas strip are busy no matter where you go but it just seemed like there was no structure or organization here. Servers and bussers were running around, the hostess was nowhere to be found and after standing there for a good 5 minutes without so much as a hello from anyone, we decided to just go to the outside window and order. \n\nThe line was long but moved pretty quickly. We each got a frozen hot chocolate. All I can say is that although it was good, in no way, shape or form was it worth $12. I suppose you go for the ambiance so had we been able to get properly noticed inside and had been able to enjoy it there, it may have been worth the cost. However, being completely ignored by the employees and having to wait outside in the cold for a $12 drink that I'm quite certain I could have made just as well at home is NOT my idea of a hit out of the park. Save your money, time and hassle by going somewhere else or at the very least check this place out at a less crowded time."

Its a really cute place, although the wait is kinda long, but I expected it so it didn't bug me much.  Our waiter was extremely friendly -- he even offered to sing happy birthday. Two things that are a must get, the mac and cheese (OMG SO GOOD) and frozen hot chocolate!"

We opted to sit outdoors since we wouldn't have to hurry to catch our flight.  There were heat lamps, so we figured we could deal with the cold.  One of our heat lamps wasn't on at all, and when we told one of the workers, they said...\"oh no..its on\"...and then walked away.  Ummm...if we can touch it, its not on.  They finally came out to check it when someone else complained.\n\nI wanted their famous frozen hot chocolate, but since I was sitting outside in the cold, I figured a regular hot chocolate would be better( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/UVGh4r1nVItdL2eqcm8sXQ/l ).  And then I ordered a cheeseburger with waffle fries( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/ayHA76-OUgfSRC6mHswuMA/l ) to fill up my hungry belly.  The portions here are quite large!  I ate about half my burger and then started picking it apart to eat the meat.  The bun was fluffy and fresh, and the fries were nice and crispy.  \n\nExcept for the minor heat lamp incident, the service was really good. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  I'll have to come back again for that famous frozen hot chocolate!"

We waited about 30+ min for an outdoor table (we were told it'd be another at least 15, so I had to start the commotion), and when we got to the outdoor seating area, half the tables were empty!  We were starving and have studied the menu so we were ready to order pretty much right away, yet the waitress told us SHE needs a minute.....which turned into 20.  The appetizers took forever to come out and the 2 omelets even longer. \n\nThe cherry on top is when 2 more people wanted to join our party of six, the waitress told us it's not allowed as it's considered fire hazard....makes me think people leave their logic at home before coming to work.  After speaking to the manager, he was able to \"eliminate\" the fire hazard and seated our 2 friends.  Which by that time, we were all done eating.\n\nI certainly won't be coming back."

We had high hopes. \n\nFirst, we should have made a reservation (not even sure that is possible).  We waited one hour to be seated.  The restaurant was not seating people in the side patio when we arrived, but began doing so immediately before seating us.  The music was extremely loud.  I asked that it be turned down and was told that because the kitchen was \"open\" they couldn't hear it.  I stated that I believed the patrons should be accomodated, not the kitchen staff (sorry everyone - I know you work very hard, but it should be pleasant for those of us eating and paying the bill).  The music volume changed twice while we were there - down, up, (complained again), then down again.\n\nSecond, we waited for 35 minutes for the breakfast which consists of a long thick piece of bread - nothing special, not flavored or seasoned that I could tell, was supposed to have 4 slices of bacon, but only had 3 1/3!.  In addition, the server started to pick up the plate from her tray and dropped 1/3 of the whipped cream on the tray.  She did not offer nor did she bring more to replace it.  The maple syrup is enough for a normal sized french toast and should have been more - the server never returned in time to request more.  The berries were fresh.  The worst, however, was the so-called \"sunnyside-up\" eggs.  Yes, the sunnyside was up, but the eggs were completely cooked through and rubbery - I had to use a knife to saw through the edges - the worst eggs I have ever had in a restaurant! Finally, I ordered the cappucinno. I should have gone to Starbucks!  It was in a very small cup and while tasty, was not satisfying - for the price it should have been twice the amount of coffee. The restaurant does not refill coffee. They brought my husband a large mugof coffee and that was all he got for his \"bottomless coffee.\""

First we tried to be seated, and had to walk to the back of the restaurant and thru all the tables only to walk back to the front. A little strange but OK.  Our server was really nice and helpful while he was at our table but once he left it was hard to get his attention about something. I ordered a burger because i was indecisive about what to get, and figured it was hard to mess up. Boy was I wrong. Meat was almost inedible. My boyfriend also ordered a burger but double but it didn't come with a bun? So we had to pay extra for one? He was find with his but he eats anything so that doesn't say much. Needless to say I didn't eat my burger so naturally there was room for dessert. Deep fried Oreo sundae! OMG! I see why this place is known for their desserts, it was really good, very creative and decadent!  Could only eat about 25% between me and my boyfriend. I wouldn't go back to that specific location or maybe try the NYC location and just stick to the desserts."

It was a little scary eating it at first. Their famous frozen hot chocolate was nothing but cold chocolate. I didn't think anything was spectacular about it. However I did like their food. Their chicken salad, their cheeseburger, their French toast log, was all great. I wouldn't wait in line just to eat here though. The only reason why we came here was because my cousin went crazy at the though of frozen hot chocolate, boy was we disappointed that it is nothing more than what it is.

FYI; they text you when your table is ready which I thought was really cool & an option that most restaurants should use.\n\nThe first time we sat inside. I ordered the White House Pizza whicvh is a sauceless white pie with ricotta, mozzerlla and parmasean, topped with fresh basil & truffle oil.

We stood there for literally 30 mins which wasn't bad because the guy at the front window provided us with a complimentary Frozen Hot Chocolate while we waited.

I found out Las Vegas is a hustle bustle busy type of town with a small town \"Ill give you service when I feel like it\" attitude for anywhere on The Strip...and ths was no exception.\n\nHad reservations for an outside table at 8pm on a Wednesday.  We arrived around 7:30 and told the hostess we were early and would take a table ahead of time if one opened up.  She told us that wouldnt happen and to check back in at 8pm for our table.  The inside portion was filled but definitely not swamped, we could not see what the outside seating area looked like.\n\nWe went to the bar which was able to seat 10-15 people, and had about 6 of us sitting there.  The girlfriend and I ordered a fish bowl to pass the time.  10 mins later no fishbowl.  15 mins later bartender tells us hes going to get 'The master bartender' to make our drinks.  Not sure if it was a joke or he meant the female bartender working with him who's shift must have ended the same time as he said that as she grabbed her backpack and left.  30 mins lapsed aand it was time for our table, no fishbowl, countless others had mixers served to them in the meantime.\n\nIt was now 8pm aand our table should be ready.  Checked w the hostess who told us that we needed to wait to see if any tables were open.  10 mins later they brought us to our table.\n\nThe outside seating area had 3 other tables with people and the other 7 or so were empty.  What?  No one walked out before us and the tables werent dirty?  Why the wait?  Waiter came over and asked how we were doing.  We told him we had waited for our fishbowls and they never came.  More or less deadpan expression and said 'Well do you still want it?'  No good sir, we want the delicious food we heard about.  Waiter took our drink orders, 2 sodas.\n\n........10 mins later no sodas.  20 minutes later no sodas.  No one else was seated around us minus a table directly behind which had a family of 3 apparently in the same position as us because the one younger guy was sleeping on the table.\n\nWe left after the 20 minute mark without being served our drinks.  We had some lacking service in Vegas but this place takes the cake.  Overpriced menu which would have been forgotten, but lack of service on top of an overpriced menu is just a thumb in the eye with a squirt of lemon juice."

The frozen hot chocolate is honestly comparable to some good chocolate milkshake...It was good at first but after a while it became too sweet for my taste. This occurred after finishing about half of the to-go cup. This is definitely something you want to share, unless you LOOOOVE chocolate. Another downside was that there was a 2 hour wait to actually sit in the restaurant!! My friends and I opted for the to-go option instead, which was definitely our savior. I'd say that this a place you should check out once for the experience but not really somewhere I am dying to return to."

They looked short handed, but no one was in any hurry, including the cooks. It took over half an hour to get our food, and after getting the food, we were ignored for another 30 minutes. When we asked for water at the waiter kiosk, which we had to approach to ask, a hostess offered to give us water, and another waiter stood there and made fun of her instead of helping. We wanted dessert, but after waiting for 2 1/2 hours to get to this point, we gave up. Then we had to wait 15 minutes for our change!

We were there on a little vacay last week, and ate there twice.  The first time Kevin was our server.  The hostess promptly sat us with no wait, even though there was one, because we are diamond members.  She was super nice and so was Kevin.  They both remembered us when we came back 2 days later, and made a point to come over and ask us about our stay and activites we did.  The second time I think our server's name was Mylin.  She was super nice, and even though she was busy she took good care of us.  In fact we had to rush out to catch our flight, and even though the table next to us asked her to split a check about 38 different ways, she still got us our bill promptly.   The food both times was amazing.  I'm not big on the frozen hot chocolate, but cold stuff isn't my thing.  I did have an AMAZING mochachino.  And the Mac N Cheese is TO DIE FOR.  I'm pretty amused at all the people who docked them points for being expensive.  Um, hello?  this is Vegas, on the Strip, at Ceasars Palace.  These are probably the same people that have no problem shelling out $30 to get into the Night Club du jour, and then pay $15 per drink while there.  Please.  You aren't going to find Denny's prices (or taste, for that matter) on the strip."

It was pretty crowded when we arrived around 10 AM so we were told we would have to wait for 20-30 minutes. I really liked how the hostess was using an ipad that would message my iphone when our table was ready =) You are given the option of sitting inside or out but we wanted inside because it was getting really hot outside already. Thankfully we only had to wait 10 or so minutes before I received a text saying our table was ready. \n\nWhen we sat down our table was pretty wet since they just cleaned it. We ordered really quickly since we had looked at the menu while we were waiting and we figured it shouldn't take that long to get our food. Unfortunately, we waited 30-40 minutes for our breakfast -___- I was getting REALLY HUNGRY since we were seeing all the people around us receive food and we weren't getting squat... FINALLY our food came over and we were amazed by how big the portions were. My pancakes were ginormous, my mom's steak sandwich was an entire baguette, and my boyfriend's waffles were the size of your head. \n\nBlueberry pancakes: Super nom. They put a good amount of blueberries in there and they don't drown the pancakes in butter like normal places do. Syrup was great and on the side.\n\nSteak Sandwich: MASSIVE. The steak was very good and they add bacon and three fried eggs to the sandwich. The bread is an entire baguette aka way too much for one person to finish. The potatoes on the side were over seasoned (too salty) and they burned the first batch so we made them make some more. \n\nCorned Beef Hash and Eggs: NOM. The hash here is super fresh and meaty, WOW!! I was jealous of my dad's plate after he gave me a bite of the hash. They give you 4 pieces of bread though which was kind of overkill.\n\nBanana Cream Waffles: Satisfy your sweet tooth. Two waffles with bananas, cream, raspberries, blackberries and chocolate sauce. Not for the faint of heart.\n\nAll in all the food was DELICIOUS but our server forgot about us and it's VERY difficult to get the server's attention since there is so much going on here."

I'm sad to say that it was a huge disappointment. \n-We got the peanut butter frozen hot chocolate and it was just chocolate milk with a few chunks of ice and a bunch of whipped cream and peanut butter sauce. Not worth the price.\n-We also got the fried snickers sundae. Again, hugely disappointing. the ice cream was good quality but thats all I enjoyed. The snickers were previously fried and I think refrigerated because they were hard as rocks and burnt."

I had a Turkey club and sweet potato fries. They were decent, but I probably should have just ordered a Sundae as the desserts looked great. The service was very slow. The place is very loud and I would say not cheap for what you get. The atmosphere is nice, but probably better geared for kids. The bathroom is also about 5 minutes away from the dining room. OK I am exaggerating, but it is outside the restaurant and a bit of a hassle to get there. All in all the experience was just OK."

Wait was too long. This only made me all the more psyched to get my hands on that frozen hot chocolate. It must be hella good to take this long, right?! Ahhh no. It was tasty but nothing spectacular. Velvety rich and nicely frozen. Good to share w/ someone but melts pretty fast. Kinda didn't hit the spot for me. That foot long hot dog we got was ok. I think I was more excited about that than my chocolate.\n\nMaybe the NYC one is better. Who knows? I shall save myself for that."

So, on Saturday night after the CES show we decided to go to Serendipity for dinner and frozen hot chocolate. \nI have to agree with with my co-worker, the foods at Serendipity were delicious specially the Mocha frozen hot chocolate. I had the crab cake salad and my co-worker had the Thai beef salad. Both salads were good and right portion size that save us enough stomach space to enjoy our frozen hot chocolate. \nHowever, the service was sorta slow, it took then 30 min to serve us the salad that's why I took off one star from the rating. Otherwise, this a good place to eat at Vegas where they serve\" normal\" food beside steaks and expensive food I believe. I will definitely go back again to try the frozen hot chocolate =)"

The main reason for our late lunch was to get the frozen hot chocolate! This is their main attraction, similar to the movie. The Frozen Hot Chocolate was amazing! Just the right amount of chocolate, whip cream, hot chocolate, frozen chocolate, and topped with chocolate chips! It's a chocolate overload. You have the option of individual frozen hot chocolate ($12.00) or shared frozen hot chocolate ($15.00-presentaiton is so adorbs!).

We requested a booth and the hostess said no booths are available, so we chose outside. As we walked by we saw booths open and questioned her. She said \"we have other reservations before yours, sorry\" ok first off at least act like you care and don't get snotty.

Jeff our server was very nice he suggested a few things. We decided on the onion rings for an app, she had the meat pizza and I had the pulled pork. \n\nAll the food looked yummy. The tower of onion rings looked good until we each cut one open to dip into the sauce. They were not cooked all the way there was raw batter inside. Jeff asked if would like another batch and we asked him if it was supposed to be like that. He said no. We said no thanks.  Nothing like under cooked food to really turn your stomach.  Already she said this is not going well for a second chance. And I agreed. Her pizza $21 looked good and tasted ok. Nothing to write home about. It had no outstanding flavor. My pulled pork sandwich barely warm came with cold fries $19. Which I didn't mind me that much (didn't want to seem like a bitch and send them back) and the pork was so dry. Not yummy juicy saucy pulled pork. The pineapple on top was good and grilled. \n\nFor one soda, one iced tea and two entrees our bill would have been $48 plus tax and tip. We still left a tip, btw. Like I said we were on a comp. the manager shawn never came by to say hello even after our server Jeff said he knows about the onion rings. I am huge on customer service!!!! I've worked customer service and hospitality for 20 years. If one of my customers/guests had a bad experience and I invited them back  to give us another chance.  You can bet there will be one of the managers there to visit them and make sure that they had a good visit!!!! \n\nThis place is not cheap. It's not cooked well. It's obvious that managers do not care and the hostesses need training on how to give good customer service. \n\nI spend a lot of my free time as a diamond member enjoying everything that Caesars Entertainment's properties has to offer. I think they should rethink having this place carry their name or do some serious training. \n\nNo need for management to contact me. I won't waste my time coming here again. Not looking for comps or any kind of freebies or discounts. \n\nMy opinion this place would not have any stars if it wasn't for Jeff."

The place is on the strip and very popular and I understand why. The staff are awesome. The last guy server was funny. \n\nYou have to order the chicken and waffles but be warned, this is a serving for at least 3 people or unless you are a big 6footer dude with an appetite like a football player! =) The Benedict's plates are good. I like also the strawberry waffles! I only ate 1/4 of it as it was huge. Even the order of just pancakes are meant for sharing! You have to get the Frrrozen hot chocolate! Very good! The banana split is good too. My daughter ordered French toast but it was ok. I guess because I am not really a French toast kind of person. Hehe\n\nI suggest before ordering, look around you and what they order as you will see this place is not for dieting. Prices are pricy but goes with the portion. I will be back!"

I let our server know who brought out the avocado on a side plate.

It happened to also be an unusually cold day in May so when we were seated on the balcony, we weren't too happy...especially when we were in the direct path of where the wind blew strongest.  We spoke to a server who called the manager over and moved us against the wall, which helped tremendously.  But seriously?  I wish they used a little more common sense when they saw that I was with a 10 year old and a friend who didn't have a jacket.  \n\nThe food itself was decent but Vegas has a lot more places to eat that have delicious food so unless you're coming here to eat AND get yourself some frrrrrrozen hot chocolate (or in our case, an Oreo flavored one), save yourself the trouble, the time and the money.

See the pics? I took them right as it placed in front of us. Gloppy whipped cream, a part of it already landslid, ice cream never has those freshly scooped nooks and crannies. NEVER. Sundaes here never come to you looking like it was just scooped. It looks like it was made 20 minutes ago, but the mystery is, it's not like we waited that long for it. So I don't know what it is with this place, but it's one of the only options on the strip that is an ice cream parlor. And honestly, once you get past the hot (or I guess in this case, cold) mess, it still tastes good. Just not pretty.

But as soon as we sat down, the table next to us ordered the largest, most beautiful plate of nachos. So we ended up ordering one of those as well. One plate of nachos and one Deep Fried Snickers Sundae. \n\nThe nachos had two kinds of meat - chicken on one side and beef on the other. It was like getting two dishes with completely different flavors in one. I kept going back and forth between them because I couldn't possibly decide which one I liked better!\n\nWhen my sundae arrived in its huge goblet, it was sitting on a plate due to all the over-flowing - they really fill that thing up so you get your money's worth! The waiter warned me that this sundae melts faster than any other due to the hot fried Snickers. But that didn't bother me! I love my ice cream super melty. So I dug in and took my time. I'd swapped out a scoop of vanilla for a scoop of Oreo. And I probably should've done the same with the chocolate, too. There's so much hot fudge on this thing that having chocolate ice cream just doesn't make sense - hot fudge and Oreo would've been perfect! My only minor disappointment with this dish was how surprisingly hard the Snickers were. I was looking forward to them being hot and melty from the fryer. But I guess they might freeze them beforehand to avoid a mess?\n\nI didn't visit this place in NY for years because I thought it was all hype. (Also because all people talk about is the Frozen Hot Chocolate, which just doesn't sound as amazing as these sundaes.) But now I'm completely and totally in love! I cannot wait to return again and try another gigantic ice cream creation! Like the Deep Fried Oreo Sunday?! Or maybe the Carrot Cake Sundae?! How could you go wrong?!?"

I've been to the NY location but was always off put by the long wait so have never actually been there.\n\nWe were walking around LV and saw this place.  It was nice to see it here!  There was a line for the sit down restaurant but there's a take out window that sells a subset of their regular menu.  Basically, large donuts, drinks, etc.  We shared a large frozen hot chocolate.  The menu said it's meant to be shared by 2 but 4 of us shared it and we didn't even finish it.  Yes, it's really really big!  I think it was $15.\n\nIt was good but not great.  It's just a fancy chocolate milk chocolate with tons of whipped cream and shaved chocolate.  Hit the spot for the day and wasn't compelled to come back for more."

The atmosphere is really cute (reminds me of Candyland/Disneyland) and the outdoor seating on the Vegas strip is great as well. I ordered the veggie burger without bread as all their bread has egg in it. It came with lettuce, avocado and a creamy, spicy sauce that was great! Unfortunately, I broke out the next day so I feel sure that creamy sauce had dairy in it. It came with sweet potato fries. They tasted like they'd been sitting out for five days. They replaced them with waffle fries that were hot and tasty. Based on the food and atmosphere, this would be a five star restaurant (minus the $4 soda - whatever it's tourist land) however, the waitstaff were beyond inattentive. I was clear about not eating dairy. I think either the waiter didn't listen or didn't care because when I spoke to the chef about the bread he was very attentive. We ate our entire meal without any of the $4 soda we ordered and the waiter finally brought a refill when we had finished our meal. He took so long to bring us the bill, we paid in cash to avoid having to wait any longer."

The food came pretty quickly, and the service was alright - not terrible but not amazing. The frozen hot chocolate is pretty big, but a little bit deceptive since half the order is whip cream, so MEH on the portion size. I'd share this with friends as its way too much sugar for one person, so split between three people its OK. The fries were alright - nothing amazing, also not worth $7. I thought burger king fries taste about the same at a fraction of the cost. Most of the items on the menu seemed overpriced for what they were ($20+ for burger etc...) Our bill ended up being around $28 for a frozen hot chocolate and a side order of fries, what a ripoff! I would not come here again, as the prices were quite high for mediocre food. \n\nOn a side note, if you order on the walk up window its about 80% cheaper, seems like price discrimination -but hey its Vegas. There are other places to eat which are much tastier on the strip, save your money and spend it on drinks."

It's a shame that they can even manage to mess THAT up. How hard is it to use a blender? I'd like to not sip on cubes of ice in my slushy, thanks. Granted, they do have more flavors of the frozen hot chocolate here (Oreo, peanut butter, mint, etc.). If you want to keep it strictly Vegas-style, the bartender will even throw in a shot of rum for that extra umph. Of course, for an extra $10, I'd rather gamble away at the tables and order a few cocktails there instead...\n\nI can't say I'm able to compare the actual food to the NYC location since I've only tried desserts, but the mac n' cheese here was pretty legit. However, for $14?? I can buy 14 boxes of Kraft for that and be just as satisfied."

For the price of $20.11 for all three courses, it was a bargain (since a breakfast entree by itself averages $15+/plate).\n\nFIRST COURSE\nChocolaccino (Frothy Cappucino, Fresh Whipped Cream & Shaved French Chocolate):\n-For some reason I thought this was a cold drink, similar to that of a Starbucks' Frappucino. I was not expecting this to be a hot drink when the waitress brought it out. Luckily she was kind enough for me to switch it out for the Mixed Berry Smoothie. (Took a few sips of it before sending it back. It was nothing spectacular.)\n\nMixed Berry Smoothie (Blackberry, Blueberry & Rasberry Blended with Yogurt):\n-Lots of seeds from the fruits! So if you dont mind getting a few stuck in between your teeth, then definitely get this. It's a richer version of Jamba Juice. \n\nSECOND COURSE\nBreakfast Quesadilla (Scrambled Eggs, Potatoes & Bacon Quesadilla served with Sour Cream, Guacamole & Pico de Gallo):\n-Extremely hearty! There are big wedges of potato in the quesadilla itself. Very tasty!\n\nTHIRD COURSE\nCheesecake Lollipop & Frrrozen Hot Chocolate Shot (Sample Shot of Serendipity's Trademark Frrrozen Hot Chocolate & Cheesecake Lollipop):\n-Dessert presentation, the desserts were decoratively served on a white plate with chocolate syrup and sprinkles. \n-The Cheesecake Lollipop, meh. I didnt think it was that great. It was soft cheesecake on the inside, with a coating of chocolate and crushed pistachios on the outside. This dessert actually tasty rather salty, when I was expecting it to be sweet.\n-The Frrrozen Hot Chocolate tastes exactly like the name. Imagine hot chocolate, except served cold.\n\nThis place has both quality and quantity covered. Definitely consider sharing a meal so that you can have room for dessert!"

First of all, it's Vegas and why would a place like this, located literally right on the strip, smack dab in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd close at midnight?  That seems ridiculous, but we made it with plenty of time to spare. Apparently this place is a full service restaurant with a bar inside, and not just a dessert joint.  The hostess inside informed us that since we had a large party, that it would be quicker if we ordered from the window and sat outside.  Cool, that sounded easy enough.  So we perused the menu posted right outside, next to the window that you have to order from.  After a good 15 minute wait, we get to the window, and order...But wait!  Not all the items we wanted were available at the window. What?  The menu is right there!  Apparently, cakes are not available at the window.  So, the guy at the window told us all we had to do was go back inside and order at the bar.  Then take our food outside again.  Ok, here we go again.  \n\nI order at the bar, and the bartender seemed a bit peeved that we were doing that, but lightened up at the end.  He was, after all, trying to serve the patrons at the bar too, and it seemed weird to order all this food at the bar.  Whatever.  What made things worse was that one of my friends wanted a big pretzel, and when I ordered it, the bartender told me that I had to order it OUTSIDE because it was only available at the window.  WTF!  The food all comes from the same kitchen, right?  So, I sent my friend outside and by this time, they were closing up the window, so they told her she couldn't order.  Oh HELL NO!  She wasn't having that, so she very sternly told them that she would be getting her pretzel and that they would be serving her.  And they did.\n\nEnough of all that.  The ordering system could use some help.  That's obvious.\n\nThe desserts were all huge and were meant to be shared amongst 2 or more people.  Did we?  Hell no!  This is of course Vegas and we were living a life of excess...if only for one weekend. \n\nI'm happy to report that the carrot cake, all 12 inches plus of it, was delicious...according to my friends.  The humble pie, a peanut butter pie with graham cracker crust, was a bit too overwhelming in the peanut butter taste.  The same goes for the \"Can't say no\" Sundae...too much peanut butter and not enough everything else.  The pretzel was an epic fail!  Epic!  The frozen hot chocolate was a disappointment.  Perhaps if I didn't have it served \"to-go\" it would've had a better presentation, then a better taste.  For me, it was an overpriced Frappachino.\n\nThe best dessert in this place, hands down, was the deep fried oreo sundae.  It's huge, it's messy, and it's delicious.  Yes, that's still the sundae that I'm talking about.\n\nThe cakes and pie slices run about $7-$10 and can easily feed 2-3 people.  The sundaes are $15 and also feed 2-3.  If they could figure out a more efficient ordering system, they'd certainly have my business again...without the pretzel!\n\nShould be more like 2 stars...but it's VEGAS BABY...VEGAS!"

Although I've been to Vegas a couple times before, I hadn't had the opportunity to try Serendipity, but this time we made it a point to go.  It was an unusually cold and rainy afternoon (somewhere in the low 50s) and after the hostess told us that the wait would be upwards of an hour, we almost turned our heads down in defeat.  Then, in the corner of my eye, I saw the Serendipity-to-go! Suddenly, I had images of sitting in our hotel room overlooking the bellagio fountain with dark clouds and rainfall, snuggled up while sipping their famous frozen hot chocolate.  It sounded like a dream! We ordered the Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate for Two.  It was made quickly and topped with a generous dollop of whipped cream with 2 long straws.  The size of the frozen treat was likened to that of a Big Gulp than that of a milkshake.  But with the expensive price tag, we were satisfied with the gargantuan portion.  The first sip was light, frothy, creamy, with just the right amount of oreo embedded into each slurp.  We enjoyed the drink all the way back to our hotel room and did not get sick of it even as we reached the bottom of the cup.  I would definitely go back to Serendipity's next time around!"

I've been to the original NYC location several times, and looked forward to seeing how this west coast location compared to the east coast OG one. My partner in crime for the weekend, Li, had never been to either location, so was more than happy to accompany her. \n\nSlightly hungover, we needed sustenance before diving into the famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. I was shocked to find out that the wait was only 20 minutes. The interior doesn't quite have the charm and coziness of the NYC location, but is open and spacious. There is also outdoor seating available. The music was an eclectic mix of 80s, 90s, and current tunes, which I appreciate, but the volume was a bit loud for my liking. \n\nSo, we ordered: \n- Cup of Tomato Soup: The flavor and texture were perfect, and one of my best I've ever had. I loved how it was accented with goldfish crackers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=Hni3DAqO9NXPth8mNsK5eA \n\n- ABC Burger: Avocado, Brie Cheese burger. Li and I were intrigued with this unique combo, and decided to split this and it was wonderful. Juicy burger and toasty buns, and ginormous portions of avo and brie. This was accompanied by crisp, sweet potato fries. \n\n- Frozen Hot Chocolate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=85Ev04Z-UaQksArEs2ZVNg The grand finale! It didn't disappoint and was super thick and chocolatey. It's better than a chocolate malt/milkshake, as the consistency is icy, yet creamy. This was topped with a huge dollop of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Talk about choco heaven! Oh Mylanta! We sipped and slurped as much as our stomachs could handle, but failed to finish it. \n\nOverall, a decent Serendipity experience. Our server wasn't the friendliest nor super attentive. It took some time for my Diet Coke refills, food, and bill  to arrive at our table. Ambiance isn't as quaint and lovely as the NYC location, but it's still fun place to bring your friends and family. Be warned that the prices are a bit high, food portions are large, music is loud, and service can be spotty. There's a lil' retail area for the t-shirts, frozen hot choco packets, etc., Also, unlike the NYC location, there is a take-out window where you can order from a limited menu (some snacks like pretzels, donuts, etc.,as well as frozen hot chocolate) to enjoy in front of the patio tables in front of Caesar's Hotel or to take along while you walk the strip."

However, since I am doing the whole Serendipity experience I have to knock off a few stars.  \n\nThis location sits in front of Caesar's right off the Strip.  It is not very big inside and there are limited seats (inside and out) and that translates to long lines.  It is cute - all white with pink and orange accents.  However, the way around the lines are just heading to the window outside the sit down restaurant to get your sweet treats.  This too can result in a long line, but it moves!  \n\nMy hubby and I ordered a couple 16oz Fro Ho's and found a ledge to sit to drink them, since the limited outside seating was all full!  It is a huge outside space and they fill less than half of it with seating, which results in people plunking themselves everywhere!?  Duh, put out more seats!  You have the room!!!  Anyways, we sampled out Fro Hos and enjoyed the people watching opportunity that this section of Caesar's gives us.  \n\nThe Fro Ho tasted exactly how you would expect - an icy version of the winter treat.  It was yummy and just as good in the sun on a ledge as it would be inside - maybe not as pretty, but I loved it all the same.  \n\nIt is a fun stop.  Next time I am getting the donut that is as big as my head.  It is calling to me!!!"

Our service was TERRIBLE, it took probably about an hour and a half to get our food (and we went in between the breakfast and lunch crowds) and one of the meals was sent back.  The prices are astronomical, which I'm sure is because of the name and not because of the quality.  My egg-white omelette was not good enough to be $14, I'm sorry.  The mother/daughter duo that I went with ordered the shrimp fritatta ($18) and on their plate was a small egg-white omelette, one large shrimp cut in two, one asparagus spear and covered in a huge helping of arugula lettuce.  They ended up sending it back because, well, it had one shrimp and one spear of asparagus.  When they asked to order something else because it wasn't what they thought it was, we received a snotty response from the server.  Let's just say our 9% gratuity was about 4% more than he should have received.  The best item our group received was the kid's fruit bowl for the 3-year old in our group."

Service was a bit slow but the waitress was obviously very busy and when she did come around she did her best to make sure we have everything we needed.\n\nThe food however, left a lot to be desired. My friend had the chicken Cesar salad which for $21 had only three strips of chicken and two gigantic croutons that were impossible to eat. Lettuce looked old and wilted. I had the chicken fingers buffalo style, and although the portion was generous, the wings were so soaked in sauce they were soggy and difficult to enjoy. Next time I'll order the sauce on the side.\n\nWanted to give 2 stars but we ordered a frozen hot chocolate for dessert and it was delicious and we ordered the \"single\" portion but it was plenty for two! That alone would bring me back!\n\nOverall I recommend the desserts, but suggest you eat dinner somewhere else first."

Definitely worth the experience, but I hope I won't wait so long next time. The only flaw, was waiting for a glass of water. I had to ask 3 people, and wait an unusually long time for it. I was so tempted in helping myself at the staff station, but decided I better not. So for that I give Serendipity 3if I'm paying $12 for a drink, water should magically appear when asked."

I ordered the Bloody Mary, which was biting and peppery just how I like it. But if you like it like soup, you would need to mention non-spicy. \n\nI got the Orchard Salad. It's tossed with vinaigrette, cubes of chicken breast, spinach, pecans, dried cherries, apples, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, feta crumbles and apple slices. \nHubby got an omelette, forgot which one, but it was huge, beautifully fluffy and not greasy at all and it came with their crispy yummy seasoned fries.  It was the perfect lunch after a late night of gambling and drinking.  A bit pricey tab at $46, but not at all out of the ordinary in Vegas and at Caesar's.  \n\nOh! and the bartender was so nice! We were so stuffed from our meal and said we didn't have room to order the FHC but he poured us each half a glassful just so my hubby can try it anyway.  Loved that!  \n\nWe are definately coming back."

One would think that the ingredients of blue cheese and bacon could save the dish, apparently not!! The meat was dry and over cooked. For a place that charges that much, I would've liked them to ask me how I wanted my burger cooked! The fries on the side however, were well seasoned and the right amount of crisp.\n\nNow the drinks ....\n\nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate lived up to it's expectations! Rich, thick and wonderful, topped with whipped cream. It's definitely worth the try.\n\nA boozy milkshake with peanut butter and a liquor that I cannot remember. YUM!! Served in tall glass with whipped cream and a cherry on top! It was really, really good. \n\nMimosas were fresh and crisp and we let the raspberry dropped into it soak up all the alcohol before eating it.\n\nAll in all, A VERY AVERAGE experience. I would only go there was drinks and desserts. The food is over priced and an absolute waste of money. The staff are unfriendly and disinterested.

They were not that busy but had severabl people waiting outside and empty tables inside.  The check in person asked for a cell phone to text us when the table was ready, yet called out names for others.  People that came after us were seated before us since we did not have our cell phone in hand to know they text us and called names for others. When we were going to be seated outside and asked if we could take one of the EMPTY tables under the umbrella, we were told they were not being waited on.  We asked for an EMPTY table in the corner that was BETWEEN 2 tables that had patrons at (would assume the waitress that was serving those tables could serve the EMPTY table) but were told we would have to wait 5 minutes before they could assing a waitress to our table.  We asked if we could wait while sitting at the EMPTY table.  That bothered the hostess but she allowed us to sit there.  And...YES... we waited... longer than 5 minutes as waitresses passed up our table to wait on the tables around us.  After ordering, the coffee took forever to come--- in paper cups because they ran out of actual coffee cups...with a LESS than packed house....guess that means if they are full at breakfast time...EXPECT TO GET YOUR COFFEE IN PAPER CUPS. The food was delivered...3 of the 4 of us had food.  I tasted my food while we waited...it was COLD.  The food would have been good if it has at least been warm.\nCustomer service of check in and seating, service at the table, food prep and delivery all need attention."

Maybe it was or was not, so I went back during the day (sobered up) to make sure it was real. \n\nThe night before I had frozen hot chocolate, chilli cheese dog with sauerkraut, and a jalape\u00f1o-bacon pretzel. At the time, all of them were solid five and six stars. Unfortunately, now that I'm back with a clear mind, and a six star rating only exists through inebriated eyes, the frozen hot choco and chilli cheese dog were just ordinary.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate was wasted the second time when I realized it was just a chocolate shake topped with hot cocoa powder. The chili cheese dog, although a decent foot long, was your normal chilli cheese dog. \n\nOn the bright side, I did have a winner with the jalape\u00f1o-bacon pretzel. I don't like pretzels, but in this type of combination that was served with a side bacon horseradish, I can eat them all day.\n\nOverall: a decent place to eat when you're hungry after a late night on the strip, but a hit-or-miss during the day. 3 stars for the dogs and drinks. 4 stars for the pretzel, and that is what I'll be back for next time."

While he went out gambling one night, I treated myself to dinner.\n\nAfter being seated at a two-top by myself, I waited for approximately fifteen minutes before ANYONE stopped. No menu, no drink order, nothing. His first words to me were \"Oh, are you here by yourself?!\" He was apologetic and said he was just sure I was waiting for someone. Finally, he said he'd be my date for the night.\n\nI love banter, and normally this would have been great, but something upset me about him constantly insinuating that there was something wrong with me for eating alone. Surely that can't be that uncommon in Vegas.\n\nMy dinner was lackluster. I ordered a chicken and pasta dish and was not even remotely impressed. This is not to say it was bad by any means! I just expected it to taste better than the Olive Garden. I understand this is a restaurant geared towards dessert, so that's fine. \n\nI had a drink called something like \"Alcoholic Girl Scout Cookie\" and it was good. I never would have guessed that there was alcohol in it, because I couldn't taste it and it did nothing for me. Oh well.\n\nI remember dessert being fine. Nothing that wowed me, as I can't even remember what I had.\n\nOverall? You're definitely paying for the experience and being able to tell your friends you've eaten here. I still think it's a fun restaurant to stop into, but don't waste your money on dinner, focus on booze and sugar.\n\nAnd if you're eating by yourself, you should probably just order your drink straight from the bar."

I had to go, and when I found out they opened one in Vegas, it was perfect!  I stared at the place as we walked up and down the strip and I decided that we should go there on our last day in Vegas.  \n\nI was super excited watching people taking their Frozen Hot Chocolate on-the-go.  People just seemed to enjoy it so much!  I didn't expect the place to look so....pink.  We went  inside and asked for a table for 4.  The girl looked at us, and said it would take about 25 minutes.  I looked around and saw that it was about 60%, it was only 2pm.  The tables that were empty just needed to be bused and we would've gotten seated right away.  Anyway, we agreed and she said, \"Okay table for 2, your name?\"  We looked at her confused, and I said no, for 4.  Maybe an Asian, Middle Easterner, and two Mexicans weren't the \"ideal\" group, but c'mon!!!  Don't look at us all confused when clearly we said for 4 less than 30 seconds ago!  After about 20 minutes, we got seated and we looked at the crazy, fun menu and tried to decide what we wanted to grub on.  I looked around the restaurant to see what others have ordered, and everyone either just finished or they didn't have anything at the table.  So it was up to us to just pick something and hope that it was a decent size and delicious!  \n\nWe decided for 2 regular Frozen Hot Chocolates, Chocolate Cake, and Carrot Cake.  Our food came out in no time and the cakes were huge!  I was so excited to take the 1st sip!  Okay, I give you this....I'm not a big fan of chocolate, and I hate anything that comes from a powder mix.  Yes, why did I want to try the Frozen Hot Chocolate??  Just because, it's one of those things you just HAVE to try.  Anyway, it wasn't the greatest thing I've ever drank.  It was good, but because I can taste the powder mix of the drink, I wasn't a fan.  Everyone else liked it though!  Chocolate Cake and Carrot Cake, delicious!  It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, and it was moist and smooth.\n\nAfter reading other reviews and said that the original in New York is way better, I still have to try it.  I can't say I'm disappointed.  It was good, but I still want to go where the original is.  Maybe when it's not 100 degrees outside, and more like 30 degrees in the snow would make this place a wonderful experience.  And you know what they say, service is A LOT faster as you move East!"

I am thinking if we went there for desert I would have been in love with the place.\n\nBasically our breakfasts were just ok, the service was, blaaaa, ok, nothing exciting. \n\nWhat stood out to me is the lack of team work or caring at the front desk. Someone had broke a glass and so shards of glass were all over the front near the door and the check in stand. One of the 3 hostesses basically kicked some of the glass over to the hostess stand and that was about it, so everyone that walked in automatically walked into a pile of glass. \n\nI just kept watching and watching thinking a manager would do something when they came up. Nothing happened. So finally one of the servers (wait staff) walked by that had not been in the area for awhile. She saw the mess, looked around, kinda shook her head (you could tell she was thinking WTF), then ran off got a broom, dustpan, etc and cleaned it up. \n\nI was just so surprised that 3 hostesses and a manager stood around and did nothing but kick the big shards into a pile, then left it there. It was just amazing people were walking all over the glass."

Loved the movie Serendipity and the outdoor pink patio looked so cool and fun that they suckered us into coming.\n\nOur story.... we came in for a late lunch.  We ordered and the waitress mentioned that it will be a while before we get our food because they are busy.  Once she left, I looked around only to notice that they were only half filled to capacity (since the majority of their seating is outside and half of the outdoor tables were empty)  Go figure.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer, salad, and we were going to split the hamburger.\nThe appetizer arrived, and the hamburger arrived.... salad never made it.  Once we finished eating, we finally caught the waitress and asked about our salad... she apologized and said she would take it off the bill.  Take it off the bill????  Wow.... how generous of her considering we never received it!  \n\nIt was comical because when she said that, she was acting as if she was going to do us a huge favor by not charging us for that salad.\n\nIn addition, she had no sense of personal space....not sure if she was hard of hearing or what, but when we were ordering, she was leaning down right in our faces.... It was very annoying.\n\nAbout the food.... bland!  Our hamburger was dry, the soda was flat and seriously, the cookie dough sundae could be made at home and it would have tasted much better than theirs.  Seriously overpriced.  Months before, I tried the Carl's Jr. hamburger version of what we ordered here and let me tell you, Carl's Jr. was a 10 on a 1 to 10 scale and this was a 1.\n\nThere are so many delicious restaurants to choose from in Vegas so I am shocked as to how little they care about good service and food here.\n\nI think it is a good idea to look at Yelp before going into a restaurant because if you see the average is 3 out of 5 stars, its safe to assume that nearly half the people weren't satisfied.  That's huge.  Most of my favorite restaurants have 4 or 5 stars... figures this isn't one of them."

If I boycott a place I don't care if I'm starving I won't do it. But the louder of opinions in the group won and I have no say since it isn't my vacation. So the BF and I kept them company while they ate their over priced and over rated items. \n\nThere wasn't anything that was gonna get us to order something or even taste what people are ordering so I have nothing much to say on food and will just quote what people said at the table. \n\nMy one brother who's definitely a foodie wasn't happy with his frozen chocolate what he said was \"a melted milkshake\" and he would have been better off \"with a In N Out milkshake\". Then I found out he wanted to come with me instead to Max Brenner. *sigh* (And we did go the next day while family shopped). Another brother got coffee and it was nothing special. The kids liked their desserts, but they're KIDS. I can put sugar on roaches and they'd think it's a crunchy goodtime. My sister had a sundae and it was fairly standard. My cousin had a cake that was super in size and had a lot of leftovers but he said it was good. \n\nService wasn't rude this time, but it wasn't really hitting service standards. It was more like- take the order, bring it, and if you need the check go find them. Desserts took about 35 minutes to come. One person came late and ordered after everyone else. They got a slice of cake and that didn't come around until way later when most people had their desserts done....Cake doesn't even need to be prepared so it shouldnt take 50 minutes to receive it! Just put it on a fucking plate and add whip cream and a strawberry.\n\nWell, just confirms to me- I wasn't just \"hating\" in my first review, this place isn't that great with service nor expediting orders.  Dessert shouldn't take almost 2 hours specially since we're one of the last reservations of the night. \n\nStop buying into brand names. Serendipity lost the charm that made it sucessful in the first location decades ago. Serendipity doesn't live to its name and is just bad misfortune with each visit. \n\nAVOID."

Serendipity... sound like you are getting dipped in chocolate or something,..lol.. just based on this cute name alone I would have totally checked out this place! \n\nUnfortunately my experience was not as cute at the name... the restaurant was not busy at all but after we got seated.. it took a loooong time for the server to come to our table. To the point where i told my husband, if they dont come in the next minutes let just go...\n\nand of course, she comes...\nI ordered the hot chocolate ( since i was freezing) and this big cup full of ice cream, chocolate fudge and whip cream, my husband ordered a martini. Ive been with my husband long enough to know that he likes his martini shaken hard so there are bits of ice in the glass.. and i guess that makes the martini taste really good..for him. But at the same time.. you have to take the martini to him right when it is done, because the ice will melt and get the drink all watery.. no one likes that.. Yes kind of picky.. but everyone has their preferences when it comes to drinks...\n\nI saw the bartender make the drink... or rather heard him..shake it hard and there it sat on the counter waiting and waiting once again for our server who was M.I.A.. It was sooo long that i decided to get the drink myself from the bar counter. The bartender i think also knew it was a while because he kept moving the drink forward for someone to take it..\nwhen i went up, he was nice enough to apologize and bring the drink. Right after that the server comes in and brings the hot chocolate and the ice cream. \n\nIm not sure if my taste buds were off by then because of the bad service that we got.. but everything was just sweet... hot cholocate was like the one from the package that you add water..and ice cream was ice cream...\n\nNot asking for a whole lot.. just be attentive to your tables... expecially if it aint that busy!"

I usually don't write reviews because I generally feel like each persons experience is always different. Sometimes it can be the waiter or just a bad thing you ordered and some people want to give the place one star for it. Well this isn't that. This place is genuinely the worst restaurant I've ever been in. And I've been to A LOT. It was my wife and I's 5th year anniversary and we picked this place out of any other in Vegas because it sounded fun and like it had a huge variety. We wanted a place somewhere around 25-30 a plate so that we knew it'd be good food but still affordable. We had a reservation for 9 which means that each person had to spend a minimum of $25 dollars as well as a mandatory 18% gratuity added to the bill. We get there and have to wait an hour to be seated. We told them it was our 5 year anniversary and wanted it to be special. I guess special to them is a small table with 9 seats around it right by the front door when they have parties of about 4 taking up giant booths. Anyways, I finally order and get their $23 fried chicken meal - it was worse than literally a fried chicken made in a TV dinner. The mashed potatoes had the viscosity of water with a little bit of sand in it. HORRIBLE. We tell them our displeasure with our experience and are told \"were sorry you feel that way\", the end. I would never suggest this place to anyone in my life and I hope this place goes under and everyone that works there can never find a job in the food service industry again."

We had to scoop off most of the whip cream but it was delicious! We ordered that and a burger. The burger wasn't anything fancy really but the meat was thick and they used a big slice of real cheese. Yum. Their French fries were really good. Nice and salty and crisp. I want to go back for their brunch menu and try the omelet and of course, another frozen hot chocolate! It was amazing! Prices are a little steep so it's not going to become a regular stop for us but it would be nice for special occasions. Our server was nice. I was hesitant because of other reviews but we had Patty and she was great. Took a little long to get our check but I knew she was busy. I think the worst part of the entire experience was the hostesses. They seemed bugged with me when I asked a question and were a little rude. Bad day maybe? Advice for locals...do valet at Caesars. It took us forever to get there and I didn't know where to park so I called and she said do valet. I'm so glad we did because it wasn't a bad walk from there. Valet was full but I told him we were going to Serendipity and he said they will always take cars going there. Pay the few extra bucks to have the car valeted. It's so worth it.

I was instantly intrigued and felt I had to stop in and try this little gem. \nThe location is right on the strip. The ambiance is very bright. Orange and pink galore! It sort of has a diner feel but a little more upscale than the typical diner. \nThe menu has a nice variety. First off is the frozen hot chocolates. They have a lot of different flavors. I got the chocolate peanut butter. My friend got the white chocolate. Both were delicious. Huge portions! The small one was plenty enough to share. It was super rich, pilled high with whipping cream and drizzled with peanut butter. Very sugary of course but still delicious. \nThe main courses include pastas, pizzas, burgers, salads, and sandwiches. A nice spread of choices. I had the spaghetti and meatballs. The portion size was nice. The taste was just alright. Meatballs were a little dry and the sauce was okay but not too spectacular. The price was little high but everything on the strip seems to be pretty expensive so nothing different from other spots close by. \nI recommend the outside seating. It is great for people watching :)"

In fact, I have never had such amazing steak as I did that night!! the steak was marinated? or drizzled with? some amazing sauce. OMG to die for. the reason for the 4/5 stars is only because we loved it so much that we went back the next day for some frozen hot chocolate from their to-go window! ..unfortunately, however, it was NOTHING like the one we had the night before (dine-in). it had a different texture and no chocolate shavings. My friend had the strawberry frozen hot chocolate and said it tasted like cheap syrup. this surprised her because the night before when we had the frozen hot chocolate, it did not seem like they used a cheap chocolate syrup.

I can honestly say that it was the worst service I've ever had, and the first time I've genuinely been upset over a meal out.

We eventually did speak to the manager, who was extremely apologetic, but the damage was already done at that point. \n\nThe only thing this place has going for it is its marketing.

Points start to drop...\n\nWe are told waiting time is 30 which becomes an hour, and thus we decide to try the long outdoor takeout line, which proved to be quicker. Now the problem with the takeout line, is your orders become limited and instead of wanting to try maybe 6 different things on the menu, we ended up getting 3 kinds of desserts. (Yes, Serendipity, think of all the extra orders you could have gotten by letting us chill on a proper table). \n\nSo was the wait worth it? Well, if an establishment is going to make people wait long, they better make it worth it! I spent over $50 on 3 different desserts and I I wish I had gone to a Haagan Daz or even McDonalds instead! The only thing worth trying was the frozen hot chocolate. But then again, it's really not worth queueing for. Do yourself a favour and go to Jean-Philippe's in Bellagio/Aria. Everything there is perfect and worth every penny."

I came with 1 friend and it was 6pm on a Wednesday. \nI was not very impressed with the hostess who seems very cavalier and flippant. Also she that told us there were no booths available, but walked us right by one. After asking, she said it was for a reservation. \nI asked to sit outside, which is pretty want, because you can watch all the people walking up and down the strip. It was a nice night too, so not unbearably hot, like usual on July evenings. They do have the misting machines, so if you're worried about your hair, don't sit outside. But if you don't mind, so worth sitting on the strip. People are so entertaining. LOL! \nI very much liked my server, Jeff, who was so much more friendly and attentive than the first time we came here. \nWe ordered some onion rings for an appetizer, which looked fabulous, but were undercooked and doughy in the middle, so we sent them back. \nI did really enjoy the meat lovers pizza, suggested by Jeff. He said it was all house made, and you could tell. It was on a thin crust, with lots of cheese and different Italian meats. The flavor was pretty good. I took the leftovers home, because it was a lot for 1 person. \nMy friend ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich, which she said was not very good. She said it was dry and the cole slaw had no flavor, but my pizza was good. Seems like their food is hit or miss. Some things yummy, others not so much. \nSo, in the end, I will bump my review up, because Theresa is a devoted, patient manager who really tried to make a difference; Jeff was a good waiter; and my Pizza was good. \nHowever, they still have some work to do to earn any more stars."

Obviously the frozen hot chocolate was excellent, but my meal this trip fell very short from what one would expect with such prices. 30 minute wait for an inside seat OR 10-15 min wait for a table outside. 100 degrees in the shade on a hot patio with fan/mist machines that don't quite reach the tables didn't help the dining experience much. Basically leaving us an even shorter timeframe to enjoy that frozen hot chocolate. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs which was a huge disappointment. The meatballs were more raw than cooked. The outer layer was brown and looked cooked but the center was still pink and squishy. I realized this after eating half of one. Possibly why I felt sick the rest of the afternoon. Both of my meatballs were the same and my friends plate was exactly the same way. $130 for 4 people and I couldn't even eat my meal lol."

The sundaes they were bringing out to other customers looked awesome.

I try to flag one of them down for a condiment and refill. Nope they are too engaged with their convo so i wait. Mind u im sitting at the closest table. Finally 3 mins later they disperse and two of them are still chattering about their relationship or w/e and the older blonde waitress notices me and quickly comes over. Ask for a refill and gives me this attitude like shes talking down to me, and saids she will get the my waiter  to bring it out. Also ask for the condiment and cant really pass it off so grabs it from the station where she was chatting to my table 8ft away. \n\nIMO if everyone on yelp is complaining about the service. There is a reason. Go hire and train ur staff to be more professional, hire more for busy seasons instead of overworking ur current staff, balance out the female to male ratio, pay ur staff more so they put more effort and provide better service, hire one busboy will clean up and reduce service time, get rid of employees who come to work to socialize. \n\nsit there for 3 mins time 3 people is 9 mins of stuff something had to be done but got pushed back to be done later and provided slower service. Ive worked in an efficient sushi restaurant and so much stuff can be done in 9 mins.

They were not spicy at all but had a great favor. The wife had nachos and she enjoyed them. Neither of us could finish our meal, especially her Nachos. Huge Tray of Nachos.

My friend kept dropping her fork so when I told him \"sorry we can't take her anywhere, she keeps dropping her fork\" after the second time. He said, \"Well that's too bad because I don't give a fork,\" came back with a hand full of forks, drop them on the table causing us all to laugh hysterically! We are a very sarcastic group and he went right along for the ride. Giving as good as he was getting from us.  \n \nHis food suggestions were spot on and delicious. He suggested the steak and egg sandwich on garlic bread, we all split. The steak was tender, the eggs cooked perfect, the garlic roll it was server on was nice and crusty, and who can say more about bacon! Saw the hotdog and just had to have one. He warned me it was a foot long which made laugh because of the suggestive nature of a foot long weiner. So I changed my order to the chili dog, realizing, laughing at myself, as it came out that it too  was a foot long! The French fries were great, the kind that stay crispy forever. \n\nThe prices were high, but the portions were huge. So it kind of evens out. Just sad that I don't have a triple stomach so we could have the ice cream they are famous for. So next visit we will just go for the ice cream!  And Izzy of course!"

From the extremely slow service, the inflated prices, or the below par frozen hot chocolate?!\n\nIt was about 11pm at night and I just came from Mon Ami Gabi over at Paris hotel. I thought I would try serendipity for dessert since it is quite popular and the idea of a frozen hot chocolate is interesting. So me and my cousin arrived at Serendipity and we see a long line outside as well as an empty seating area. I was informed that inside sitting is for people eating in, and the line outside is for take out or basically drink orders. I got in line thinking \"this should be fast\", \"I'm sure they have plenty of staff considering it is summer and the weather is 105 degrees\". Boy was I wrong! It took forever due to shortage of staff!! It was finally our turn to order and I got the Amaretto Almond Frrrozen Hot Chocolate because a friend of mine recommended it. It was quite convenient of them not to have the prices on the menu. Not that I am cheap with food, but I would like to know what it is I am forking over for this drink. hahaha. So the total comes out to be $11.82 for the smaller size. Holy Moly!! I was shocked! but too late to back out now, after waiting for at least half an hour to order. Then I had to wait another 10-15 minutes for them to make the drink. I am thinking to myself \"this better be the best drink ever!\" Again I was greatly disappointed. It tasted like iced down flavored Almond slush. I've had much better almond slushes in OC. Needless to say, I am never coming back here! It was such a waste of time and money! Don't buy into the hype like I did!"

The glamorous fair food comes with mediocre quality.\n\nAt best, you can say you've been to Serendipity 3.

And I got to watch everybody elses alcohol and hot chocolate creations being made. I tried a cotton candy martini just because it sounds cute and he said there is actual cotton candy in it. Cool! I picked the apple flavor and He shoved a big chunk of cotton candy in the glass. Cute! But it just melt away as soon as the alcohol hits it and it tasted just like an oversweet apple martini. Meh.

So I appreciate that they had a \"Fun on the run menu\" which is basically a way to grab something quick. The service was definitely faster, our drink was ready right after we paid!\nHalf star because the place was pink and cute. Half star because it tasted good. Minus four stars because the price was ridiculous and this place is seriously over-rated! \n\n$10- Frozen Hot Chocolate: For taste, I thought this was chocolate goodness. However, my friend says it tasted like his protein powder mixture.\n\n$11- Mochacino Coffee Frozen Hot Chocolate:  This was pretty tasty.  The mocha was rich in flavor and blended well with the chocolate.  I liked the espresso chocolate on top.  Although it was delicious, the Costco's version of Mocha Latte comes pretty close.\n\n\nWould you pay $12 (after tax) for a regular size (16 oz. maybe) of iced hot chocolate topped with whipped cream?  Why do you call it Frozen hot chocolate when it wasn't even frozen or icy?"

The place was pretty cozy and you couldn't help but look at everyones tables at what kind of dessert they chose. OMG everything looked amazing and the smiles on peoples faces when the waiter would come with their goodies. We wanted that smile haha.  Probably the only downfall of the place was it took forever forever and ever to get our food. We ordered the nachos, fettuccine, asian salad and mac n cheese with bacon bits and jalapenos. The portions were huge my goodness. When we were done eating we were soo full that we thought couldn't fit dessert in sooo we just ordered a frozen hot chocolate to go. So glad we did because it was amazing. People always ask what does a frozen hot chocolate taste like? I always say it taste likes deliciousness go try it.  I really want to try the white chocolate next time."

But on to focusing on the LV location today:\n\nWent on Christmas Eve for lunch at 12pm with my mom and my friend\n\n- Service: Hostesses were stuck up. However, they did do their job. Their told us it would be a 20 min wait and it was about a 20 min wait. When we came back we got seated. So can't complain too much. Our waitress was pretty bad. It took her forever to come greet us and asks if we wanted any drinks - only to realize that the hostess forgot to give us food menus and only gave us the menus for the alcoholic drinks. My mom ordered hot tea and it took her 2 trips back to remember to give it to her. It wasn't even that busy when we went. Since my mom and I were sharing a meal, she told us she'd come back with extra plates. \"Oh, well that's good...\" I thought. Nope, she came back with plates - dirty plates. \"Whoops,\" she said, \"let me get you cleaner ones.\" Came back and the \"cleaner\" ones still had some dry food stuck on it.\n\n- Food: I ordered the Las Vegas steak strip sandwich... the size of it was fantastic BUT the taste was very mediocre and quite bland. The worst part was that it was super oily. I ate about 1/5 of the sandwich and got full due to the greasiness of it. Got pretty nausceous for the next few hours and didn't get hungry again until midnight. That's pretty bad. The sweet potato fries were okay. The frozen hot chocolate was worse than the NY one because the cup was pretty much 1/4 frozen hot chocolate and 3/4 whipped cream. And I had to pay like $10+ for the stuff. Disappointment.\n\nBleh. Never coming back unless they give me a free meal."

Of course for a getaway weekend we'd spend one of our meals there.\n\nWe get there and there is a 30 min wait, but we're down for it as there is a quick stop bar where the ladies partook in a frozen hot chocolate to wait out the line. Out front there are also shaded tables to wait by.\n\nWhen we finally got in we were seated on their outside deck, close to one of the mist fans that was partially broken. It kept dripping water on one of my friends. \n\nWe quickly decided and tried to flag down our waitress.  It was incredibly hot outside and we wanted something to drink. Water took a while to come out and when we were ready to order our waitress took her time getting to us, giving us the index finger \"one minute\" signal while she continued to gab away with a coworker. \n\nEventually we got our orders in, and I ordered the french toast log. I think it took close to 40 mins for our food to arrive. By that time we were seriously pondering leaving and just paying for the drinks. But when we got our food it was all tasty, every plate was gi-huge-o. My log of french toast was ridiculous. \n\nTrying to get our waitress to come bring us the check was another ordeal. Good food, but ultimately disappointing service, combined with a dripping fan and sitting on the hot patio. I think I'll just stick to going to Serendipity when I'm in NYC again, at least that time proved worthy of the wait."

The last time I visited and most recent we got the Banana Split. For it being about $15ish dollars was WELL WORTH IT!\n\nIt was HUGE! Like 4 scoops of ice cream, maybe even two bananas and strawberries w/ lots of caramel and chocolate on top. It was byfar the best one I've ever tasted. What I loved was when asking the person taking our orders which would be best, he did not try to upsell us to get the more expensive item. He told us the TRUTH and even checked on us everytime he walked by even though it was super busy inside. I didn't get anything else that day, since the split was definitely more than enough, but can't wait to go again next time and actually try the food."

At last hubby and His sister decided on a place to eat before a show, we were close by so we said.. 'What the heck..' Wish we hadn't.... Will explain why shortly.  \n\nFirst, the staff was unfriendly and rude(the hostess in particular, in fact I noticed that about a lot of the other places this time). Upon arrival we requested our table for 10   Four adults and 6 children... They wanted to separate tables or charge the minimum 20% gratuity(which was fine), but we wanted to sit together. They separated us while having two tables side by side by the same waiter. I was disappointed at this time already. \nSecondly, we sat at our table for a good ten minutes before even getting water brought to us. \nThird, the waiter seemed to no interest in answering questions about the menus. He address with such answers: \" u don't know what type of food you like\", \"if you like burgers\" I almost felt like had revisited DICKS LAST RESORT..... \nFurther, the food was your average cafe food priced as American bistro... Lame! \nFinally, the only appealing thing seemed to be their sweets menu--- it was exactly that.... Too sweet, I also thought that the \"frozen hot chocolate\" was a contradictory term, for which I disliked the place even more. Don't try to sell me on the idea of a frozen hot chocolate. It's simply a blended iced chocolate drink. \nWill never visit again..... I should just be so blessed to have soooooooo many other options to dine in Vegas."

A giant bowl of white chocolate shake is filled to the brim and topped with whip cream to match and sprinkled with white chocolate shavings.  It's on the rich side, but worth splurging. \n\nThe food itself is on the pricey side, but why come here just for dessert.  I had the sliders, a good portion.  What makes it is the sauce.  If you have to take it to go, don't forget to ask for a side of the sauce.  Delicious."

We spent our ONE night stay at serendipity for TWO hours. Ridiculous. By the end we hated being there we just wanted to leave. The waiter was a total buzzkill. We didn't even finish the dessert that looked good cause we wanted to go see the rest of Vegas. Not going back!"

But Serendipity 3's frozen hot chocolate could use some work.  It just tasted like chocolate milk from the carton that had been in the fridge.\n\nWhat I did enjoy was the carrot cake.  Yes, it's expensive but it's also enough to feed 6 people and it is actually moist and delicious without being too cloying.  The cream cheese frosting was also fantastic!  I wish I knew the recipe because it would go so well with red velvet cupcakes!\n\nSo while I'd give the carrot cake 4 or 5 stars and the frozen hot chocolate about 3, the service is a 1.  The waiter we had was so rude.  My boyfriend and I wanted to share the small 10 oz frozen hot chocolate and the waiter would not stop insisting that we order the larger one.  Even after I told him *repeatedly* that that was what we wanted, he would not let it go.  Seriously?  Funny how he didn't bother mentioning how ridiculously large the carrot cake was!

The restaurant itself is adorable, really colorful, girly, pink and just plain cute. \n\nAs far as the service, we got our food in a reasonable amount of time, given that they were really busy. Our server was really nice and cheerful; I appreciate that because the last thing you want is a grumpy server. With the reception though, there were issues with one of the hostesses (err she ticked me off) but I won't go into that because she later apologized.\n\nI ordered the three cheese grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup. This has got to be one of the cutest presentations I've seen in a while because it had goldfish crackers in the soup. SO ADORABLE! Even with three layers of bread, I still could taste mostly cheese which was really yummy. I kind of wish there was a little less brie because there was a little too much of it. The soup was good too, not the best I've ever had but not the worst, that's for sure. \n\nOkay... here we go... I think I read one too many reviews of  the Frrozen Hot Chocolate. Everyone (not just Yelpers but everyone period) has hyped it up to the point where I expected it would taste like how D'Angelo looked in the \"How Does it Feel\" music video... just good all over. (Nice visual, right? LOL) I wish nobody told me anything because I would've liked it a lot more. Honestly, in my opinion, it was a chocolate milkshake with halo-halo* ice mixed in with a bunch of whipped cream on it.  Good but not good enough for me to pay $10 again, which I really didn't because my friends and I split it because it was huge.\n\n*Don't know what it is?

One cannot come here without trying the frozen hot chocolate. I have always associated Serendipity with frozen hot chocolates, but their other desserts are worthy of experiencing, too.\n\nThe only thing(s) I did not quite enjoy which most will think I am absolutely crazy are the fans blowing in the outside seating area. I chose to sit outside because the AC was on full blast inside and it was uncomfortably too cold for me, yet it was just as cold outside with the fan blowing a cool mist across the dining area.

The bread was garlicky and I looove bacon but the steak didnt have much flavor, it was not worth the mula. I basically paid 25 bucks for bread and bacon, thanks guys."

We had the frozen PEANUT BUTTER hot chocolate, because that is their signature item, and my bf had never been there before. The PB HC was amazing! We followed that up with the Blackout cake sundae chaser. It was HUGE! 2 scoops of ice cream on top of a mound of chocolate cake, hot fudge, whipped cream. OMG. I didnt find it pricey because thats the same prices we pay here in Nyc. And it was huge and delicious. Cant wait to go back. There is also a take out window if you dont want to wait for a table."

And I fell in love with the sundae-shaped topiary covered in lights that was outside. And the curvy, womanly torso-shaped hostess stand.\n\nDefinitely try the frozen hot chocolate. I would recommend splitting it with someone, unless you are serious about your frozen drinks. I ordered the Raspberry Truffle, which was a frozen hot chocolate the size of my head, with alcohol, and piled high with whipped cream. Add in the chocolate shavings and raspberries, and I did not need dessert.\n\nFor dinner, I picked the foot-long chili cheese dog. Looking at the menu, there were quite a few things I would have picked. But I had a burger that morning at 5 (long night) and had pizza for lunch, so I went with the hot dog. Bad choice. It was huge (I'm talking circumference). There was no way I was picking that thing up to take a bite. Which is probably why they serve it with a big knife. The hot dog was also really salty. I couldn't eat more than 3 or 4 bites. The waffle fries are a must, though. The sweet potato fries are also good, but the waffle fries win in my book. One friend ordered a cheeseburger and enjoyed it. Another friend had the grilled cheese with tomato soup and also liked her food. So, I'd just stay away from the foot-longs.\n\nThe food and drinks were a little pricey, but not when you consider you're eating in Vegas, right on the strip. \n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely go back for dessert. And maybe to share a frozen hot chocolate."

            "review": "Well, the time has come for me to write my very first review on Yelp. More specifically, that time has come because people are sick of hearing me talk about places and what I thought of them in real life. So: off to the internet!\n\nThere's no better place to cut my reviewing teeth on than Serendipity3. There's good! There's bad! There's drama and intrigu-- truthfully, there's not much intrigue.\n\nThe thing that gets me the most about Serendipity3 is that there is just so much *potential*, but, man, potential's hard to live up to, right? The food is more than serviceable, but just shy of great. We went this past weekend and were informed that they'd started a seasonal menu, which means the things that transcend, individually, to great, might not be available. In my opinion, one of those dishes is the ~*Mac & Cheese Pizza*~ (the punctuation shows you how highly I regard it). This is apparently now a \"winter\" food, so look out if you'd like it in, oh, say, May. That said, this most recent trip, our waitress, a woman named Phoenix, went the extra mile in making sure I got what I came for (ifyouknowwhatimean). \n\nMy dining companion (so fancy when you say it that way! It's really just my boyfriend Al, but if I can't be fancy on the internet, I can't be fancy anywhere) ordered one of the seasonal items, a sandwich called A Summer Bries, with turkey, brie, apples, cranberry mayo on raisin pumpernickel bread. Because Al has resigned himself to a lot of things in our relationship, I eventually ended up with some of that sandwich. And here's the thing: it was a good sandwich, but for a restaurant where we dropped $80 on a meal at 4 p.m., it wasn't what it could've been. \n\nThe accompanying waffle fries (because sweet potato fries are for people who hate freedom) were like if Arby's curly fries and Chick-Fil-A's waffle fries had a baby, but also in that baby was some gourmet blood, like from a grandparent, so that they didn't immediately remind you of a drive thru and oil-soaked cardboard. Let's be clear: that means they were DELICIOUS.\n\nWe got the requisite frozen hot chocolate, which has either a.) shrunk or b.) we ordered, on accident, an individual one. I was still trying to get Phoenix at the time it came out, so I didn't want to ask. It was good, it always is. But is it as good as the amount of money it cost? I think that probably depends on several factors, like the temperature outside, the time of year, and whether I'd won $20 on penny slots in Caesars. Your factors probably vary, especially if you're, like, allergic to chocolate or you'd rather spend the money on booze. Doing the frozen hot chocolate and alcohol and pop easily bumps your bill up to the next price point.\n\nThis past trip was also our first time sitting on the patio, mostly because it's always so busy and we never wanted to wait. The patio is nice, and, for someone who gets sudden and random fits of why-are-all-these-people-so-damn-close-to-me?!, like myself, it gives you a little bit more space around you. The inside can sometimes feel like you're right on top of the table next to you, which: imagine how awful that could be for a Cavs fan seated next to a bunch of people in Garnett jerseys.\n\nPhoenix was, far and away, our best waitress (or waiter!) ever. The service there can get a little slow, especially in really, really busy times (but since they're always really, really busy, this is pretty much a constant) and on last year's birthday trip, we waited 45 minutes for food without any sort of acknowledgment from management OR our waiter. I was in a pretty easygoing mood that trip, but I can imagine that happening on a different day and the rage blackout that may have followed.\n\nThe last thing I think worth mentioning is: KIDS. This is the perfect restaurant for parents looking to throw down just a little coin for something vaguely fancy, but not at the risk of getting glares from a hundred stuffy, be-blazered diners. Where you fall on that is obviously your call. On our most recent trip, I watched a boy squirm so much his chair fell over and then he cried for the next five minutes, but I also watched a baby happily blow spit bubbles in a way that made me want to sing songs about rainbows while skipping through a meadow. My heart was that light."

Worried about being full after as well as the crab came being a beaded deep fried mess. WAS NOT THE CASE AT ALL. The salad was huge, I forced it all down, it contained a variety of mixed greens, grapefruit slices and the vinegarette was great,  very healthy as well. The crab cake surprised me. It was a very good size and contained more crab then bread and not greasy a plus in my book. I also indulged in a MOJITO I believe was mango (don't remember) but I was satisfied.

My friends got the original and mint ones which were a lot thicker in  consistency and stronger in taste. I liked the mint one personally because it had little bits of mint that tasted like Andes mints. What makes these drinks different was the consistency of the drink, it had a more creamy taste rather than a Starbucks Frappuchino. I think the original was a little bit too sweet for my personal tastebuds. I think this drink is made for two people because it comes with two straws in each drink.

There's not much of a bar and you won't find Sportscenter on any TV.  You are at Serendipity because your wife/girlfriend/girl-you-want-to-impress dragged you out here.  Just resign yourself to the fact that you will be dining in a big, pink restaurant and you may actually enjoy yourself.  That being said, the food is actually quite good, if you can get over the cutesy dish names (Spinny Dip vs. Spinach Dip).\n\nAside from the menu, you'll find very few similarities between Serendipity Las Vegas and Serendipity New York.  The NY location is small little cozy restaurant tucked away on a side street in the middle of a big city.  It's been made famous by the John Cusack movie of the same name and guest appearances on Sex and the City. The Las Vegas location is smack dab in the middle of the brightest, tackiest, loudest spot on the Las Vegas strip.  When I say it's on the Las Vegas Strip, it's literally on the strip.  If you spill your drink while dining on one of the patio tables, you'll most likely hit a tourist walking by.  The Vegas location is large and open.  It loses a lot of the intimate atmosphere of the original Serendipity.\n\nThe food is surprisingly good.  It's typical American food, except with a cute, girly name and a not-so-cute price tag.  You've got a large selection of sandwiches and burgers, and a smaller selection of pizzas, pastas, and salads.  But you're not here for the entrees.  You're here for the Frozen Hot Chocolate.  Well, maybe not you, but your female dining companion certainly is.  It's chocolate, it's sweet, it's cute, and it's really expensive.  It's what every girl loves, wrapped up in a delicious calorie-laden dessert.\n\nI'm going to reserve judgement on their service as they just opened up a few days ago.  We made reservations the day before we arrived but when we got there, we were told that the reservation system doesn't work and they don't get any updates.  We had to wait an additional 30 minutes for our seat.  We requested an indoor table but got a patio table instead.  Weather was mild but just a tad chilly so the restaurant had some gas-powered heaters going.  Unfortunately, the heaters were brand-spanking new and created a noxious odor that burned your nostrils and made your eyes water.  We requested that the burner next to us be turned off, but there was nothing we could do about the burners upwind from us.  The table there liked the heat.  There were two parties that sat next to us who left because they couldn't stand the fumes emanating from the heaters.  We were starving so we sat through the smell.\n\nPros: Great location on the strip - excellent view.  Wide variety of food.  Surprisingly edible.\nCons: Pricey ($8 for a small bowl of chili, $20 for a sandwich), spotty service\nSuggested attire: Guys - United Colors of Benetton, Girls - tight leggings\nParting Words:  Is Hooters still open?"

It is super heavenly and the presentation is magnificient.  I wouldn't share this with anyone if I had the choice."

We went with the Peanut Butter version and it was awesome, its pretty much a milkshake of sorts but the peanut butter gives it a special kick.  Highly recommended.  The reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because of the service and the pretzel.  We placed our order at the pick up counter and had to wait and wait and wait.  I'm not sure why during New Year's weekend you have only staffed one person to make your world famous frozen hot chocolate??  Also the pretzel really disappointed, it was very large in size but served luke warm at best.  Needless to say it was a hard piece of bread with nothing special about it.  I have to give props to the decor though, the Christmas decorations were super cute with pink and orange lights.  Overall I will dream of the drink for time to come, I'm already wondering where the heck I can find something similar in these neck of the woods!"

When I was in Vegas a few weeks ago, my group of four went to the restaurant at about 10:15pm on a Friday night. When I walked in there were many tables open in the main dining room and on the outdoor patio. When I asked how long the wait was for my party I was told forty minutes. I wasn't sure I heard the hostess correctly so I asked \"I'm sorry, did you say forty minutes?\" To my question the hostess rudely replied \"YES, I DID. Just wait outside and we'll call you when we have a table available\". Once outside we encountered a couple also waiting for a table and they said they had already been there twenty minutes and they had seen many diners leaving but they still had not been seated. \n\nAfter waiting about ten minutes (the couple still had not been called in) my group and I decided to just go to their walk up window. We ordered one large frozen peanut butter hot chocolate, one regular frozen hot chocolate and a chocolate cake sundae. The large frozen PBHC was huge and pretty damn tasty but I was so disappointed I didn't get to try it in one of their big glass mugs topped with mounds of whipped cream. The regular frozen HC was decent sized too and equally as tasty. Honestly though, I felt they charged too much for their to-go drinks. The price for the to-go drinks are the same as if you were to get them in the restaurant. Since you're not getting the true Serendipity experience I thought they'd at least cut back the $13 price tag for the large drink ($10 for the regular). \n\nThe sundae wasn't very good. The piece of cake in the sundae seemed like it had been setting out a while. The cake itself was a tad stale and slightly crunchy. At least the guys running the to-go window were friendly. \n\nI'm still not sure why the wait was so long when they had so many open tables. I saw a bunch of servers when I was putting my name in so I don't think they were understaffed or anything like that. After looking over the many reviews on Yelp I see a lot of people complaining about the bad service they received. Maybe Serendipity thinks because they are so popular they can treat people like garbage because they will never be hurting for business. If that's the case, which I'm assuming it is, then they can take their big frozen hot chocolates and shove it up their behinds. \n\nBesides, Max Brenner is only five minutes away from here and I know from experience that they truly care about their customers and that their products, especially their shakes, are top notch. I wouldn't return to Serendipity's now if you paid me. They suck."

Other disappointments:\n\n- Insane wait. 45 minutes for a table of 5\n- Frozen hot chocolate. It was good, but not $15 good\n- The food. Though tasty, so greasy and made me feel sick for the rest of the night\n- The presentation of the food. I think they're trying to come off as boutique, but it's just inconvenient and inefficient to eat your food from one large dish when you have six other small dishes of individual condiments around you. It's fine if you're by yourself, but when you're at a table with 4 other people and they also have 4 other dishes besides their main dish, you fight for elbow space\n- The scary baby. This isn't S3's fault, but there was a baby who was staring straight at us with no expression. It was freaky, man\n\nI mean, come on now. $15 for a foot-long hot dog? I don't care how awesome that hot dog was (it wasn't that great) or that we're in Las Vegas or if you serve it on a foot-long dish that holds it perfectly. No hot dog is worth more than a $1 per inch. It's a hot dog, aka, blended leftover parts from animals. I'd rather buy two hot dogs from Costco AND get two drinks!"

It's a bit more touristy than some other locales since it is one of the family/kid friendly spots. Avoid prime eating times to get the shortest wait. It's a bit unavoidable during the summer but you can call ahead for a reservation or just pick up something to go and enjoy the AC inside. Their to-go menu offers most of the items on the regular menu! and for those complaining..you're in Vegas, you should be prepared to spend anyhow.\n\nThe decor of this place is a bit vintage with some really cute touches like the giant sundae by the stairs and the Tiffany's lamps. If it's a really hot day, try to get indoor seating... which will probably bump up your wait. The patio has the water misters and is ventilated but you'll still feel the summer heat. \n\nService isn't bad. They get their food out in a reasonable time but at times it can be hard to get a hold of your server. If you get thirsty while waiting for your table, head over to the bar counter inside and you can get tall cups of ice water.\n\nThe food is in good sized portions, so you're not overpaying too much; its like any designer item, there's a cost for that label. I've tried a bunch of things on the menu but here are some that I can remember well... Kobe Sliders are delicious if you're looking to get something on the smaller side. The foot long hotdog comes with alot of condiments and you can add toppings. The Mac n Cheese was really good. Try the Ahi Salad and the Hangover Omelette! \n\nOrder the Frozen Hot Chocolate. it's probably what you came here for. Don't gripe about the cost because you shouldn't be in Vegas if you're not willing to spend some money. If you don't like it, at least you can say you've tried it. Personally it's a must order when I come. Why? It's different. Some of my friends have pointed out it kinda tastes like Hershey's chocolate but it's a nice alternative to soda and alcohol.\n\nOne day I'm gonna order the Golden Opulence Sundae just to say I've tried it ;) And a trip to their New York location is on my checklist as well !\n\n- jenn"

Indoors was a 30-45 min wait, with an emphasis on minimum of 30 min so we opted for the front patio area. We asked if they could turn on the heat lamps but they were completely out of propane per the hostess and manager. Ok. We endured the slight chill. If we asked if we could also put our name in for a table indoors, the hostess told us in a very condescending tone that if we wanted indoors, then we had to get out of our seats and wait in the waiting area.... And that we had to make up our minds as there was another party that could use our seats. Lovely. So we stayed outside. Five minutes later we see them light up the heat lamp that was next to the hostess and by the other large party.  Propane shortage over? No, just for them. Fantastic. Anyway so our party of 8 ordered and still enjoyed our time together. The food took over 20-30 min. The desserts came out first. By the end of our meal, we left a standard tip and went back to gambling. The next day as i was thinking about how much I paid, I realized that the total and subtotal has a $40 difference and tax isn't THAT much. They automatically added the gratuity. Ugh. While I realize this is somewhat standard, I wish the waitress would have been nice enough to remind/inform us. If the management says \"well it's written on the menu\", have you seen the size of their giant menu packed with choices and illustrations and tidbits??? Suffice to say, we clearly did not intend to give her  such a nice tip. Hope she and the staff there pay it forward. \n\nAll in all, it's an experience. Try it at least once but don't expect great service. There are a ton of choices and everything is big enough to share. Grilled cheese with a side of tomato bisque is great for cheese lovers."

The indoor seating area was pretty packed when we went so we went to the bar/patio area outside that is facing the strip. \n\nThe bartender was very nice and had our frozen hot chocolate out in a jiffy. Needless to say, the cold drink hit the spot on that scorching day. However, while the coldness of the drink cooled me down, I realized that the hot chocolate powder doesn't really dissolve leaving a kind of gritty and super sugary taste. Also, in the outdoor seating area, they spray water mist, which was both great and a little uncomfortable at the same time while I was trying to enjoy my drink. The mist was starting to form a layer of water on my skin, I could only imagine what it could do to my food. It was $17 for a double size frozen hot chocolate which was also a little pricey in my opinion. All together, if you have a big sweet tooth and are looking to have something on a hot day, this might be the place (and treat) for you if you are willing to spend money.

The desserts likely live up to their hype but come for dessert only...you can get better and cheaper food at chilis or something. We did get the \"party like it's your birthday\" cake and it was good. My husband and daughter loved it but I just thought it was ok... it was worth the price as it was huge. Cool experience but meals were so over priced"

She said its supposed to be hot but it's cold because of the ice cream and the hot chocolate. She couldn't really describe it to me until I try it. \n\nSo now I took my friend here since it was her birthday. Our service was nice but I could have better service at Ihop. We ordered just the appetizers and the hot frozen sundae. Few minutes later he gave us our desserts before our food came. We ask him we wanted the desserts last after our meal. So he took it back. The place wasn't busy as I thought it would be. When our meal came. The nachos and the onion ring was good. As I said I could have better. When we were done with the meal, our desserts came and when we tried it. It wasn't hot as they describe it to be. It was very disappointment. After it was recommend. I won't wanna go back here again."

Even after hearing that few years later the health department had shut 'em down, it didn't tarnish my memories of that delicious drink.  I was hoping to relive that moment when visiting LV.   I hate to say it, but it just wasn't the same as NY.  It wasn't as \"slushy\" as I remembered.  It was just way overly melted and I only half way enjoyed it.  Maybe it was because we were sitting outside, but it really wasn't that hot out.  My grilled cheese sandwich on the other hand was fresh and cheesy-gooy.  Yum!"

I ordered a chicken salad sandwich, my friend ordered a reuben sandwich and my other friend ordered the chicken pot pie. They didn't tell us they didn't have any more chicken pot pie until she gave us our sandwiches. My friend then ordered the chicken parm, but it took them 40 minutes to have it ready. It was ridiculous. I couldn't eat my sandwich slower.\n\nWe waited so long that we were hungry again, so we ordered dessert. My friend got the frozen hot chocolate and I got the cookie sundae. The frozen hot chocolate is delicious and covered in whip cream (heaven, am I right?). The cookie sundae was also really good, but there were too many cookies in my opinion. They gave me 3 huge ones to eat with one scoop of ice cream. Also, it was HUGE.

It's just a cold chocolate drink. The fried oreos was really good though. It was covered in like some sort of frosted flake cereal and then they fried it after. A good combination with the chocolate fudge and ice cream. This portion is pretty big depending on your appetite and cravings. I was with 2 of my cousins and we couldn't finish it.

My initial visit was to meet fellow Yelper, Michael U. We ordered the strawberry balsamic waffle and the hot chocolate french toast. Then, we complete the meal with carrot cake! \n\nOf the three, my favorite was the strawberry balsamic waffle. The waffles were fresh, tender, and had some good malt flavor that I love. The balsamic syrup was a prefect compliment to the fresh berries and cream. It required no additional syrup, which should tell you it was REALLY good because I usually drown everything in syrup at breakfast.\n\nThe hot chocolate french toast had potential, but the bread was cut SO thick that the custard was unable to penetrate the entire slice of bread leaving a very dry piece of stale hot chocolate bread. Not ideal, however, about 1/3 of the dish was very good.\n\nThe carrot cake was pretty standard in my book. Very dense, lots of gooey cream cheese icing, served cold, sundae style with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. A solid carrot cake!\n\nMy next visit was two mornings later with my boyfriend, who missed the breakfast with Michael U. due to the previous night's outing. He ordered the huevos rancheros and I had the sinners and saints french toast. The huevos rancheros were Napolian stack style and just OK. A little greasy from the chorizo with a basic green sauce. The Saints and sinner french toast was nothing like I'd imagined and was so good! One side is savory with an over easy egg and bacon, the other side is sweet with berries and whipped cream served with supper crispy 'breakfast potatoes'. I enjoyed both sides of this super moist, buttery french toast with syrup and ate as much as I could leaving the untopped middle for the birds (figuratively).\n\nService both times was efficient, but not memorable. The staff doesn't seem to be overly passionate about service. However, it sufficed, and both times we didn't have to wait for a seat and only had to wait for refills on one occasion during each sitting. I've had worse service for sure. \n\nPrices are on par with other restaurants in the area. Think: resort pricing. \n\nI'd rank Serendipity with Hash House for a very good breakfast on the strip, but not even close to ranking near the Griddle Cafe (LA) or Skillet RUF (Cbus)."

Mint frozen hot chocolate to be exact. Definitely a recommend on a hot day in Vegas!\n\nTheir lunch foods were typical American dishes with slight twists, although I would say that most of whatever originality you see is derived from presentation alone. I wouldn't say lunch is why you should come here, but definitely not an avoid!\n\nOh, and texting you when your table is ready...absolutely awesome feature."

He huffed and puffed when we asked him to come back to take our orders because one person from our party was in the restroom (note that it was not busy at all). He proceeded to give us attitude throughout our meal. When one of us asked for a side of toast, he told her he would have to charge her. I don't know why he assumed she was looking for a giveaway. You think he'd be more patient from working in such a high traffic restaurant. Thanks for nothing, Nick!"

Decided on the \"can't say no\" sundae....all because I wanted to try a slice of their humble pie.\n\nTheir sundaes are ENORMOUS...definitely meant for sharing. So while my friends did split plates of the openfaced pesto sandwich and meat pie, I chowed down on the good stuff. The humble (peanut butter) pie is smackingly scrumptious, but the crust is hard to navigate with your spoon. The real kicker was the coffee ice cream...sooo good! Who knew coffee & banana flavors melded so well?? Of course we topped it all off with the frozen hot chocolate. Little did I know it tastes almost about as good when you make it with the packet at home.\n\nOverall it's gimmicky, but then again, what isn't gimmicky on the strip?"

But when my friend and his GF suggested we meet up there for lunch, I thought, 'sure why not' after hearing their food menu is actually quite good.\n\nSo cut to a sunny Sat afternoon in front to Caesars Palace and we had to wait about 30 min for our table to open up, chilling (literally) in the mist enhanced sunshade tent which was a nice service to offer.  For those who didn't want to wait for a table there is an outdoor 'to go' window althought I suspect some of them had to wait almost as long for their food, and by that time their frozen hot chocolates were probably halfway melted (more on that later).\n\nWhat can I say, aside from the glaringly obvious presence of a fully lit LA style martini bar in the corner of the dining area (for the men who are desperately trying to salvage the last shreds of their masculinity) with sports on the plasma tvs, the decor is as cute and pink as one would expect.  And the dining crowd by my visual estimate was at least 70-80% female, complete with GFs, wives, kids, grandmas, all in all and very kid friendly place.\n\nAll 3 of us decided to go for their brunch menu items, altho the burgers and other non breakfast items looked equally mouth watering, but I wanted to save my stomach for another burger place.  I opted for the Hangover's Omelette which was a light and fluffy yet massive mega-omelette complete with cheese, sausage, bacon and french fries INSIDE the egg wrap.  Other items on the table included eggs benedict which I thought was quite good and the monster sized 'french toast log' complete with breakfast potatos, ice cream, fruit and bacon on the side.  The log was big enough to feed all of us, to be honest.\n\nNow the frozen hot chocolate, yes I've heard all about it and no, I never paid attn to the yelp photos.  I was expecting something the size of a Starbucks frappucino but my god this was huge.  They come in 2 sizes and while my friends got the classic hot choc, I wanted to try the white chocolate version to change things up.  Coming in 2 sizes I wisely chose the 'one man' size and when I got it....it looked no smaller than the portion for 2, and while normally I wouldn't complain about getting more for my money, this was too much for me and I couldnt even finish what I took to go.  Honestly, there should be a 'baby bear' size to go with the momma and poppa bear sizes.  I know I'm in the minority in this, but that's ok.\n\nFor those who try to get into the famed flagship NY store with their supposed 3 hr waits, you honestly might save a little time flying into vegas hop over to the Vegas one and fly back.  No i'm not serious but if you happen to be in LV, definitely try it out."

Expect the service to be a bit slow because of the heavy traffic.\n\nMy main complaint is about the seating inside. The chairs were sooooooo uncomfortable. I found myself shifting around just to try to enjoy my meal. They seriously look and feel like they came out of a McDonald's. My ass hurt at the end of our dinner.

So the verdict? simply meh. It did kinda taste like a chocolate milkshake but with a more chocolaty rich flavor. Was it worth the 10.00? Absolutely not. I only got through about a quarter of it before I got tired of it, said F this and threw it away. \nSo a few weeks later, I was talking to a friend who asked about my recent trip to Vegas. Told her I tried the frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity. She got all excited and told me she had tried it too but at Dunkin Doughnuts. We both agreed that it was good but really rich. Then I said \"I didn't feel it was worth the 10.00. I think she felt bad telling me that she had only paid... get this... 2.00 for hers! Trying to make me feel better, she insisted that mine was probably better to which I replied \"Nope, I am pretty sure they were the same.\" Haha, so there you have it, even though I have not tried the one from Dunkin Doughnuts, I would say to try theirs if you really feel you must try \"frozen hot chocolate\" aka \"The more chocolaty milkshake.\" No milkshake is ever worth 10.00!!! I just wish, I had come to this conclusion before basically giving my money away. Well ya live ya learn   :)\n\nNote to self: When at Dunkin Doughnuts, try the Frozen Hot Chocolate to determine if it is not as good as, as good as, or better then Serendipities version. Then post the review on Yelp so others will not have the misfortune of spending too much if Dunkins is as good as or better. \nKeep an eye on my profile if you are interested in the results. I have a feeling this study will be conducted within the next few weeks as I have been jonsing for a chocolaty fix lately   :O"

It's a popular stop for tourists because it literally sits right on the Strip and is easily accessed by foot. I could spend hours talking about how much I hate the set up of Caesar's Palace, but I won't. Bottom line, when visiting Serendipity, park valet or else you will earn the calories you eat hiking not only through Caesar's but then following the breadcrumb trail to Serendipity outside.\n\nThere is always a wait, particularly on date nights (Fri/Sat) and if you're not interested in dining in there's a walk-up counter where you can order to-go. It's not their full menu, but has their staple items. The wait is long, but you can get some great people watching in.\n\nI'm not big on sweets, so their signature frozen hot chocolate was never a highlight for me although it is yummy and when spiked packs a dangerously delicious punch! However it was a little to sweet for me and true to the Serendipity theme of heart-stopping portion sizes. In a nutshell, it's instant diabetes, but likely worth it if you have a sweet tooth.\n\nMy favorite at Serendipity is the Caesar salad which I believe comes in two sizes: appetizer and King Kong. I was having as dinner so I got the larger size and wasn't able to finish it and I blame that partly on the amazing croutons that the salad is \"garnished\" with. Usually, croutons do just serve as a garnish, sitting humbly on top of a salad and delicately scattered throughout. On the Serendipity Caesar, the croutons take the main stage as they are not only enormous but the best damn croutons I've ever eaten. I can't even believe I just spent three minutes writing about them, but they are that good! They're buttery, garlicky and toasty (perfect combo!) on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside and I can't put my finger on what kind of bread they used as I've tried to replicate them at home and they never turn out like this. The dressing was perfect, and evenly distributed throughout the salad. Towards the end things got a little soggy as I tried to power through and not fall face first in food coma into the plate, but any salad will start to do that if it sits there long enough.\n\nThe staff and service is for the most part forgettable. The couple times I've been the staff has either been neglectful or incompetent with attitude which I guess is expected of a place that more often than not deals with walk-ins off the Strip who have been grossly over-served and are now trying to order a sandwich while belligerently drunk.\n\nYes, prices border on the outrageous, but the restaurant is on prime real estate and again, the place has no sense of portion control. All in all, a nice place to take hungry out of town friends."

I had thought they would mix in the carrot cake with the ice cream but it was simply a smack dab piece of carrot cake balanced on top of the sundae. It tasted good but I felt as if I could make it at home. \n\nOverall our service was good, but one thing I was surprised about was how the interior of the restaurant seemed \"cafeteria-ish\". Painted concrete floor. Very echo-ey so it was hard to hear when conversing. \n\nI'm glad I tried this place but it's a one time thing."

Because of all the pink, I thought Victoria Secret or Miss Piggy of the Muppet Babies had a hand in establishing the joint.\n\nThe place was busy and there was a wait list that lasted anywhere from 10-25 minutes. We just took refuge at the bar which worked out anyways because we just wanted to try one thing on the menu.\n\nWe only stopped by to try that infamous frozen hot chocolate drink ($10). It's big enough to feed two people. After a few sips, I felt my blood sugar maxing out. Soon after I would have the jitters like crack head Tyrone on the Chappelle Show. \"Red Balls!\" It was okay, but I had much better sweets elsewhere.\n\nJust another place to say that I have sampled something from them. A tad bit overrated but I can totally see Serendipity being blasted on Food Network type shows and getting a lot of attention and hype."

My friends & I were in town for memorial day weekend & decided to come here for breakfast. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated which was fine because it was early Sunday morning. After being seated our waiter Alex came to our table & asked for our drink orders. I ordered water & an orange juice & my two friends ordered water & espressos & we also ordered our food at the same time. Twenty minutes have gone by & our food comes, but we did not have our drinks. No water, nothing. We flag down a waitress because in that twenty minute time frame our waiter was no where to be found. The waitress' name was Laura we had her the last time we had been there she was wonderful. We told her we had just gotten our food but we never received our water or coffee. She was very apologetic & asked who our waiter was & said she would go get our water for us & see what was going on. My friends said they no longer wanted their coffee drinks since the food had already came. Five minutes later our waiter comes over &  says \"They said you don't want your coffee anymore?\" We explained well since we have been sitting here for at this point now for a half an hour without our drinks but our food has come no, we don't want our giant coffee drinks. His response \"Well they are making it right now.....\" Really? After that he never apologized for taking so long to get us our drinks which he never actually got us. He never asked how our food was, Laura, the waitress who wasn't even responsible for our table did however. He never said anything when he gave us our check or filled up my water glass. All we wanted was an apology from him & it would have been fine, but apparently customer service isn't his strong point. To say the least our tip went straight to Laura & I will probably never go back here unless she is our server because she was absolutely wonderful & he was absolutely terrible."

This was definitely designed to be in the middle of the strip of Las Vegas. Spacious, busy, and a To Go counter, the place is alive and bustling. We surprisingly didn't have to wait long for a group of five. The service itself was a little slow, and one of my friend's order was messed up. The guy was apologetic though, and it wasn't a big deal.  \n\nThe food itself was good! I got the hangover omelet and barely made a dent. In Vegas fashion, the portions are meant for a giant. We went back again the next day to the to go counter for some frozen hot chocolate. Sadly, it seemed like a way smaller portion than the one at the sit down restaurant.\n\nFun place for a group and definitely a try if you haven't been there before! But if you have been there or the NY location, I'd think about trying some place else in Vegas."

We got seated directly next to the kitchen, it seems like they moved a table there just to get us seated but it really didn't fit so we were completely in the walkway and awkwardly positioned. It made it difficult to enjoy the meal because we had to keep moving our chairs to let people get by or staff was coming out of the kitchen with food and we had to shift our chairs to let them by. We were able to see right into the kitchen because there is nothing separating it from the walkway we were seated in - we literally timed people's food sitting under lamp warmers after being prepared for 15-20 minutes. What's worse is that when our food arrived after waiting for about 35-40 minutes for it to be prepared...it was cold...I mean cold like it came from a fridge and were some leftovers you're about to eat the next morning with a hangover  type cold...I guess all of the heating lamps were being used!! To make it worse, the server was one of the worst I've ever had - he wasn't familiar with the menu and when we asked him any questions regarding options he got irritated and rude. We had a party of 5 people and dined for about 1 hour and 20 minutes around 5 PM and our server only checked on us twice: when he took the order and when he dropped off the checks. It was so bad that we had to get up from our table and go to the hot chocolate bar for refills on our beverages (soda and water)...once at the bar no one was there to assist us or even offer their services so we actually had one person in our group get behind the counter and refill our drinks for us! After over an priced, undercooked and neglected meal I think they actually owe my friend for having to get behind their counter and work!"

I ordered the carrot cake and smores hot chocolate. The carrot cake was nothing special at all. HUGE, yes - tasty NO. The smores hot chocolate was pretty good the toasted marshmallows were good, but I LOVE marshmallows so that's an easy to please right there. The graham crackers were good and sort of smushy in the cup and I think it had chocolate kisses in it. It was ok. I also shared a frozen Oreo hot chocolate with me friend. It's not something I ever need to try again. The decor of this place is also awful in my opinion. It was about 30 degrees outside so the thing Serendipity did have going was the heat - it felt about 100 degrees in there.

It came with a slice of red velvet cake and then it was a whole lot of chocolate after that! I didn't think it was possible for me to get sick of chocolate, but while eating this it happened haha. Also, it's pretty pricey for desserts. You'd have to have one ridiculous sweet tooth for this place."

Delicious!! Such simple ingredients, but everything just went soo well together!! This was big enough for us 2 girls to share. \n\nit was very busy, but our server did manage to refill our waters. \n\nOf course, we ended our late lunch with the famous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate.

            "review": "Food is great, but service is pretty crappy, unfortunately.\n\nWe had saw this place on TV and wanted to try it while staying in Vegas one night for dinner.  I assumed we'd be dining in but my boyfriend thought we were just going to get food to go (which is what we should have done).  He followed with my assumption instead and we ended up waiting for a table.  \n\nFirst of all we walked in not knowing whether it was a place where you seat yourselves or not.  The cashier probably saw our confused faces then told us that the host was outside.  The host was probably in one of the most awkward places.  The host podium was by the wall behind the \"dinner special\" sign.  While we waited for our table we noticed people kept doing the same thing we did:  walking by the host podium looking confused as to whether they should seat themselves or not.  This should have been the first clue that this place was completely unorganized.\n\nWhen we finally got seated (after more than 15 minutes, but that's ok), we knew what we wanted and our server took our order very quickly.  I noticed there were quite a few empty tables, about half of the room in fact.  This made me wonder why we even had to wait in the first place.  Our chicken tender appetizer was very good and a bigger helping than we had previously expected.  Both of our entrees were just about the same:  I had a Thai steak salad and my boyfriend had spaghetti and meatballs.  By the time we had gotten halfway done with our entree part of the meal was when things started to go downhill.\n\nOur server was pretty good in the beginning.  He was nice and never really forgot about us until after our entrees were dropped off.  We needed boxes for our leftovers and were starting to worry about making our shuttle back to our hotel in time.  It took our server so long to get us our boxes that we ended up ordering our frozen hot chocolate for dessert \"to-go\" instead of enjoying it at the restaurant.  I think our server got overwhelmed with guests because the dining room was full at this point.  \n\nIt took us forever to get the frozen hot chocolate but at least he dropped off the bill at the same time.  We figured we'd just leave cash so we didn't have to wait for him to run a credit card.  The only problem was we needed some change so I thought I could easily walk over to the cashier and get two 10's for a 20.  Wrong.  I walked over to the cashier and asked for change.  She replied that she didn't have access to the register but I could ask the bartender if she had change.  So i did that and guess what? I couldn't get the bartender's attention because she was too busy talking. So I walked over to a different cashier who also didn't have access to the register. Who has access to the cash register then? I then tried to find our server, but he was running around the dining room helping his new guests. Finally I found a different server and asked for change.  She said she \"thinks\" she did but she took forever and a day to sift through her bills to find enough for me.  At this point I was completely irritated.  What kind of place has a customer running around the dining room looking for change?  \n\nSeriously, never again.  If we ever visit this place again, we'll just get our food to-go because this place seriously doesn't understand the definition of customer service.  They obviously don't know how to run an organized business."

The entire reason why people come here in the first place. Anyways... With that said, moving on.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came in here on a whim since he has never been (not even in DC or NYC). Please note that we were visiting Vegas for Mr. Olympia, and, therefore, we had to behave and take our bodies into consideration when ordering (ain't no one got time for bloating when your meeting world-famous bodybuilders). To drink he had some weird beer and I ordered the Cool Cucumber Melon Mojito (picture attached), so SO so good! Loved the color too! To eat I ordered the Hangover Omelet which came with sweet potato fries. The omelet was so freaking huge that I was unable to finish it and only ate a few sweet potato fries, seriously woOoOah portion control. The egg was fluffy and fresh as were the veggies and cheese inside. \n\nTake footnote that you may want to save this on your to-do-list when you want to strictly order dessert. I would go somewhere else for food since there are more prominent establishments around, however, you don't want to miss dessert here. Please, don't skip out on it like I always do."

There were many problems I had with my last experience there a while back.\n1.  Prices are ridiculously expensive for majority of the food and drinks I remember when the Deep Fried Oreos used to be 14 dollars and now it's 18 IF you are a total rewards member\n2.  The ice cream I received for the Black and White Sundae was old.  The waiter tried telling me that they get \"Fresh\" ice cream every day, but I'm a local who used to be a regular and I KNOW for a FACT how the ice cream is supposed to be like.  I'm pretty sure most of you know that when you put your spoon through ice cream it should be smooth and creamy, there SHOULD NOT BE ANY ice crystals inside of the ice cream making it a bit hard and chunky.  I mean its sad that the Ice cream at McDonald's is a lot more fresh than this place gave me for their Black N White Sundae.  Not only that but the Strawberry was pretty lazy to me if they raised the prices.  The reason why it's called a black and white sundae isn't because chocolate and vanilla ice cream, they used to have the strawberries in tuxedos now it's just half dipped in chocolate and white chocolate. I was dissatisfied with this and this was the first time I ever had to RETURN AN ORDER OF ICE CREAM\n3.  The LV Burger was OK wasn't really worth the price to me at all.  If the price was lowered a bit it would have been a lot better.\n4.  The people gave us the grasshopper in exchange for the horrible Black N White Sundae and it wasn't that great it was mediocre at best.  It was OK, but not anything too phenomenal at all.\n\nI would recommend just going here once now just to say you've been here or get like a Frozen Hot Chocolate to go, but other than that you can find something better"

Lots of flash, not much in delivery. The food, typical American-style sandwiches and the like, are o-k-a-y. Nothing to write home about, but good enough to satisfy your hunger.

Yes, it's that good... I know a lot of people sit and wonder how hot chocolate can be put into a slushy, frozen form... Well, it can, and Serendipity has done it. It's like a packet of Swiss Miss blended into a perfect slushy state, with tons of whip cream and chocolate shavings. \n\nMy friends & I ordered it, and as soon as it hit the table, we were quiet for a good five minutes as we all just sipped and sipped, until it was all gone.\n\nSo, so good, and definitely a must for any Vegas trip.\n\nJUST DO IT. :)"

A waiter also worked the kitchen and I saw some fries touch his hand and some salad as well for another meal, but he just let it go and served it. Then he takes a rag those wet rags on the counter and wipes off what he spilled without washing his hand and serves the plates...I should have said something, but they might do something to our food.

Came here after walking by it the day before, but saw a delicious add in one of the local magazines.  We were drawn to the strange thing called Frozen Hot Chocolate, the hot dog, and pretzel bun for their hamburgers!\n\nIt was hot in Vegas the week for us (high 90's) and waited 5 minutes for a table inside for some a/c, which helped a little, only a little, because all the doors are open.  We met our waiter quickly and put soon put in our orders for a hot dog ($11.50 !!!) and cheeseburger (I think it was around $14).  I opted for the criss-cut fries while my husband opted for the sweet potato (I'm pretty sure that's what they said) fries - it was really yummy.  We also ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate ($5 - not bad considering it really does need to be shared by at least one other person), which was a yummy treat for such a hot day.  We had it before our meal though, otherwise, I'm not sure that we would've been able to finish it.  \n\nAfter we had our frozen hot chocolate and finished it, the waiting game began. It was at least 40 minutes before we even saw our waiter again. He was super nice, but we never saw him out and about checking on his table.  Same goes for a table next to us.  They had the look of ultimate boredom just waiting for the check!  It got to the point that we were ready to leave before even getting the food. But of course, the food came out just as we were talking to the waiter.  So-we stayed and my hot dog was SOOO long...I swear, they say foot long but I'm positive it's longer.  It's on a toasted roll cut in half (think baguette like) so it's kinda like a sandwich with a hog dog inside.  It came with it's own dish, just as long full of all the dressing you could want on the hot dog, though I only optioned to put cheese on it.  My husband's burger was delicious.  We're happy at this point, but after waiting a little while longer for the check, we ended up just asking someone else to get the check for us and took off.  Service - not so great, but I really really like my hot dog."

The line to sit inside was lengthy so we chose to sit at the bar on the patio. \n\nI ordered the infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate and my guest ordered an Oreo Milk Shake. The milkshake was thick and malty! The frozen hot chocolate was everything I expected it to be and I didn't have an ounce of remorse after indulging in all of the whipped cream they topped it with! \n\nOn average, including tip, the bill was $30. Yes, Vegas Strip prices will get ya! The reason I give this review only 3 stars isn't bc of poor service or poor desserts, it's because of the lack of cleanliness. Sticky floors, sticky tables, sticky counter top. This place needed a deep clean! None the less glad I can finally cross off a frozen hot coco from my bucket list!

Thank goodness it was Feb and not burning hot outside.  I don't know if I will return to this location for actual dining..."

Basically, they take over 16 powders to make hot chocolate. Then, they freeze it. Then, they throw it in a blender with two scoops of Ben and Jerry's chocolate ice cream. Pour it into a glass and add whipped cream/chocolate shavings. Done. \n\nIt's actually very tasty and the portions are generous. My sister and I shared a small, and we could barely finish it.

Although you get a thick cut of beef patty, someone needs to tell them that quantity does not beat quality. The bread tasted old and it was soggy.

Instead, I ordered their chocolate french toast and my boyfriend ordered the One and Only Vegas Strip Sandwich.

The sandwich stretched for miles and the french toast was a mountain high. Definitely be cautious of the big portion and plan to share, too much of one plate gets boring. The food was good, I enjoyed my french toast, but it was too much chocolate for me to handle so after a slice and a half. I had to call it quits and packed the rest to go (which I didn't even tried to finish).\n\nOver all, it was a decent experience, but I can't really make up my mind if it was worth the long wait.

But doubt me not, the fried chicken here was OFF THE CHARTS.\n\nWhen arriving, it may be a bit confusing to navigate but it's tucked away on the outside of Ceasar's Palace. They have a to-go window with a separate menu, and if you keep walking past that window, you'll see the entrance to the restaurant. \n\nI came here on a Tuesday night around 8pm and there was a fifteen minute wait for 2 people. You give them your phone number and they'll text you when the table is ready. They give you five minutes from the time they send the text, so you can easily roam around the courtyard outside and come back in time.\n\nThe portions here are HUGE, and that is not an overstatement. We ordered the fried chicken to share, which came with mashed potatoes and gravy. I could have done without the gravy, because the mashed potatoes and fried chicken alone were the best combination. AH-MA-ZING. For something as simple as fried chicken to make such a large impression on me is surprising. Needless to say, I'll definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas just for this.\n\nNow for dessert - The Frozen Hot Chocolate was phenomenal and definitely lives up to the hype! Order to share, you won't finish it all (unless it's the only thing you order, then go for it!) \n\nThey close pretty early for a restaurant in Vegas, around 10 pm so come here early if you want to dine-in! Otherwise the to-go window outside is open later."

The wait both times was always 30-40 minutes which I could understand considering its right smack in the middle of the LV strip.  The thing I liked though was you could give them your cell number and they text you a link to tell you how many parties and how long of a wait you still had so you could wander to a near by bar or the casino to play some slots until you are texted your table is ready.  \n\nOk on to the food.  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs thinking that it's pretty complicated to mess something as simple but I was wrong.  The sauce was bland and the meatballs had no flavor at all either.  Not to mention they don't even serve it with a piece of garlic bread.  Instead a cold piece of regular white bread that was probably sitting out for a while.  The noodles were some kind of fat version of spaghetti noodle which was kind of odd.  \n\nMy date had their cheeseburger which I don't know how they could mess up but they still managed to.  She ordered it medium but it came out more like well done and left there for a couple minutes extra.  The outside was burnt and crispy and the juiciness of the burger was lacking.  At least the French Fries were good though.\n\nOn to the dessert.  We ordered the deep fried Oreos with cookies and cream ice cream.  It looked a lot better than it tasted.  When I think deep fried Oreos I think of cake batter on the outsides but they used corn flakes which made it taste awful.  The corn flakes are way too crunchy.  ended up just tossing the rest of the Oreos and just eating the ice cream which was ok.  Definitely not worth the $17 at all.\n\nIf you ever come here I recommend eating prior and just coming for the dessert."

My husband tried to order an Oreo sundae, but they were out of Oreos, and just about everything else on the menu other than a couple items. Must be good, you think? Not so much. They charged us $1 each for tap water and $12+ for the sundae. I had to wait so long for the ice cream that my tap water was empty by the time my food was ready. I asked them for a refill of tap water, and they said they can't do that; I must have given the eyebrow because she agreed to do it this once... For a mediocre $12 sundae and $3 worth of tap water, one would hope they could refill a TAP WATER. The ice cream wasn't even good enough to hold my five-year-old's interest.

For the past two years, I've been eyeing Serendipity as I passed it driving down the strip; the exterior is cute and decorated with huge frozen hot chocolates. I finally got around to trying the famous Serendipity and my experience was not at all what I had expected.. in a not so great way.\n\nMy good friend and I arrived a little after 9PM. We were given a wait time for 30-40 minutes. We were having such good conversation that I failed to even keep track of how long it had been. When our pager finally buzzed, we were led to the outdoor seating overlooking the strip. What I first noticed was the many empty tables. I guess they were just understaffed? Anyway, we sat down at an average looking table. For some reason I had pictured this place to be extremely cute and a lot more.. New York-ish? \n\nOur server took what felt like ages to even take our order and when he finally arrived at our table, he didn't seem enthusiastic at all. We ordered the large frozen hot chocolate for 2, which was $15. We both took a sip of the frozen hot chocolate at the same time and probably had the same surprised look on our faces. We were very disappointed with the quality of the ever so famous drink. It tasted no more like melted ice cream or even a super icy milkshake. My friend ordered what I believe was some sort of turkey sandwich, which was $17. The portion was decent. I didn't try the sandwich but the sweet potato fries weren't anything great.\n\nI will definitely be back in Vegas but definitely not returning to Serendipity. Hype is hype but sometimes you gotta see it to believe it and in this case, don't believe the hype. Save your time and $15 and get a milkshake from Coldstone."

Stick & the pretty lamp on the table had old marshmellow on it. NASTY! \n\nLeme tell you a secret. if you have water, blender, instant drink mix, and ice you can make these \"FROZZEN HOT CHOCOLATES.\"\nTake two-three heaping table spoons of any of your instant coffee or hot chocolate mix. Maybe add 1 tbsp of sugar if you want it sweeter. Put in blender. Add 8 oz water. Blend. Get a 16 oz cup. Fill with ice. Put in blender. Blend until smooth. TAR-DAR! You just saved $10-11 dollars."

What everyone has failed so far to mention is that this is not frozen anything. This is a richly watered down chocolate malt. It doesn't qualify as malt because it would have to have body to be that. This is like cold hot chocolate. \n\nI asked the waitress where my FROZEN hot chocolate was and she looked at me like I was an alien and said 'do you know what frozen is?' I refrained from sarcasm and told her I was well aware of the term 'frozen' having lived in NYC for years. She said that I wouldn't be able to eat it if it were frozen. I held myself back, barely, from explaining ice cream's properties. Suffice it to say that this is a dessert that is a lot of money for a lot of nothing. \n\nMy guests and I also had the carrot cake which was divine, but it was still carrot cake and not worth the $11 price tag. We also had this very strange 'Forbidden Broadway Sundae.' I'll demystify it for you: it's chocolate ice cream with a LOT of whipped cream and a small slice of dark chocolate cake. For $11. You're welcome, I hope I've just saved you the money you would have spent on that. Buy me a drink when we meet, I promise your money's worth, which is more than I can say for this place. \n\nWhen I lived in NYC I always tried to tell my friends to stay away from the touristy areas, they are MADE to rip money from your hands with a paltry return.

This place is excellent for getting your ice cream fix. The corn flake batter on the oreos was a nice touch! All of the sundaes are perfect for sharing because everything is super sweet and seems physically impossible to finish alone.\n\nIf you are coming for dessert, it's probably best to order outside because the lines are much shorter and faster. The con with this is that during the winter, it is extremely cold outside and you are forced to eat your ice cream under the heated tables, which makes it melt faster. We were also told that in order to sit indoors, we had to dine-in and order something more than dessert.

I understand waiting in line to get in (small space by the way).  But why did we have to wait once we were notified that our table was ready? We waited with five other families for another 5 minutes after being texted that our table was ready. Is that bad planning, or careful design? It was hard to tell. \n\nTHE SERVICE: The hostess and wait staff were strong. They were attentive and polite in spite of being incredibly busy. BUT I don't understand why a hostess would be tasked with busing tables. I am hoping they were short-handed and need to \"make it work.\" That doesn't explain why she kept leaving the cleaning rag behind the podium. If you can, avoid being seated by the hostess stand. It seemed uncomfortable for the two groups forced to sit there. There was a food expediter in full view making sure the dishes looked good (correct, clean plates). It was nice to see his process as he carefully attended to each plate.  \n\nAMBIANCE: Serendipity 3 is serving visual \"CHARM\" and \"WHIMSY\" in droves. From the decor to the menus to the food. While it's gimmicky, it works. It looks like a young girl's tea party fantasy.  \n\nSAVORY DISHES: They were tasty. Everything was visually appealing and massive. We had the grilled  cheese with soup, the potato bites, the chicken satay wraps, and the Ahi salad.  It wasn't earth shattering, but we didn't expect it to be. We all liked our food well enough, but I would have been happy with a regular portion that had better flavor. I suppose the super-sized portions were a nod to the aforementioned WHIMSY.  \n\nBut no one goes to Serendipity 3 for the savory dishes, right? \n\nDESSERT: Among us we had the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, Red Velvet Sundae, and a Black and White Sundae.  Everything was good. It was sweet, and gooey (when appropriate), and rich. And massive.  \n\nI have no complaints about Serendipity 3. But I also have no compliments. I don't think it's fair to compare the Vegas location to the one in NY.  The purpose here is to have a tasty meal to accompany a decadent dessert in a carefully planned \"WHIMSICAL\" location. This place is about creating a feeling through decor, location (on strip), lovely food, and massive desserts. And to Serendipity 3's credit, they are successful."

Without the long line perception, I bet this place would lose much of their business.\n\nTheir quintessential \"frrrrrrrozen hot chocolate\" tastes like something I can duplicate by making Swiss Cocoa Mix, freezing it, then putting it through my Ninja blender and viola!  I got frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrozen hot chocolate for about 25 cents!\n\nI also got the deep fried oreo with cookies n cream ice cream.  While it sounds delicious and the deep fried oreos were as expected, who thinks of deeply inserting their oily, hot deep friend oreos into ice cream??  There's a temperature difference going on here, who do you think will win?  Yep, the hot ass oreos!  So there I am eating my deep fried oreos and \"drinking\" my ice cream.  C'mon, you gotta think up of a better platting design for this dish!\n\nEat somewhere else with a shorter wait time.  I'd probably be disappointed with their $1000 dessert as well."

When we went it was absolutely packed to the rafters, complete with a 30 minute wait for a table.\n\nThe food wasn't bad - my bacon burger was decent, as was my wife's triple decker grilled cheese (with variety of cheeses). Both tasty (not amazing), without being worth anywhere close to the hefty price tag.\n\nWhere Serendipity 3 fell apart for me was in the atmosphere. The place is tiny, overcrowded and the wait staff are impatient, harried and DO NOT LISTEN. I tried to explain something specific that I wanted and our waitress seemed to be on complete autopilot as she tried to finish my thought for me without having any idea what I was talking about. Eventually I just gave up and hoped for the best (I didn't get what I had asked for).  Wife's Grilled Cheese was supposed to come with soup and a choice of chips or fries. Waitress insisted she couldn't have both, despite the menu clearly listing soup as coming with the grilled cheese (most likely so they can justify their price for what is, after all, just a grilled cheese) by default and an \"all burgers and sandwiches are served with chips or fries\" note at the top of the section.\n\nPerhaps we should have tried some of the things that people rave about here like the frozen hot chocolate, but our experience was one of mediocrity."

Inside was much like outside, a homage to a perceived idea of what an old fashioned soda pop store would look like with white chairs, small white tables, checkered floor, striped wallpaper and old fashioned designed signs on the walls. Visually it is a stunning place. \n\nOur server was cheerful, but rarely present. She had a rushed sense about her even though it didn't appear overly crowded or understaffed. She would rush to our table, take our order, rush away. There always seemed like she needed to go somewhere. \n\nThe breakfast menu read of sugary sweet items with a few classic egg dishes. My friends ordered the frozen hot chocolate which promptly came out first. It was served in a giant glass cup, or perhaps a small bowl, heaping with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles. I'm sure they served it in glass to convince the skeptic that indeed there was chocolate in there. Theirs was a peanut butter chocolate concoction and one that distinctly tasted like peanut butter hot chocolate. \n\nI ordered the cinnamon bun French toast. It came out on a long narrow plate with three pieces, each the size of my hand. Kinda wished they offered two size options because three was a little much. They were crunchy on the edges, but gooey soft in the center. The maple syrup was classic and unremarkable. \n\nOverall, the atmosphere was the driver while everything else was ok. I wouldn't go here and wait in a line, they aren't that good, but with no wait it's a fine place for a bite to eat."

We asked the waitress if they could add some more cocoa or if there was anything they could do and she explained twice to us that they use powder, and ice. Ok great so I know that but maybe they could add some more powder or whatever.  Instead of making it seem like we don't know what we're talking about, maybe that waitress could have responded differently.  $15 down the drain for one cup of ice blended powder!!!\n\nWe also ordered a side caesar salad ($6) which came out soggy.  WTH? I could have bought a supermarket salad for half of the cost and it would have definitely been fresher.  If an easy salad could be botched, I'm thankful we didn't order anything else, especially because this place is expensive."

(As my friend pointed out, they always said, \"Welcome to Serendipity 3!\") It was a cold, windy night in Vegas, but we still wanted to try their signature Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. We decided to sit outside, because it was really cramped inside--our 15 minute wait lasted for 2 minutes. Outside they have two types of heaters--these giant industrial flat heaters and the flaming towers of fire. Pick the flat heaters--they're stronger and provide wider heat.\n\nMint Frrrozen Hot Chocolate- 3-stars- I've always been a fan of mint chocolate, ever since eating a failed mint chocolate cookie in New York City (not related to Serendipity), but I've always been undecided with hot chocolate flavors. So now, I get mint chocolate whenever I see it--to understand the subtle differences each version makes. This huge cup/bowl is covered with whipped cream. It has a rich chocolate flavor, but the mint is very light. The dish on the bottom acting like a reservoir is very helpful, because you'll find chocolate seeping over the edges constantly. It was very busy, as the waiter told us about three times, while we waited for our hot chocolates--he said the blenders were working as fast as possible. It was funny, since we ended up waiting about as long as we were told to wait for a table. Still, with all things considered, I don't know if the final product was worth the cost.\n\nAmbiance- Being on the Strip, being able to sit above people and look down on them, that's grand. Sitting at night, with a mixture of 40-degree wind and flaming towers, with the lights of Vegas in the background--priceless. The decor and look of the place is great. I really wanted the lounge corner with all the pillows and seats under those great big heaters.\n\nService- Seemed a little disappointed we only ordered frozen hot chocolate, but those babies are not cheap either. My friend got the Espresso, asking for beans, but they said the beans are included in that one--but when she got it, they said they just ran out of beans. Sadness for her. Still, it wasn't too late--about 8 p.m. So they still had a few more hours, and with the popularity of coffee, I assume a lot more espresso orders. So that's a little weird.\n\nConclusion- Go for the notoriety and bragging rights to say, \"I went to Serendipity 3!\" Go ahead and get the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, any season since they got good heaters--especially if you're a chocolate lover. But be aware of the popularity, the wait, and time you'll take for your frozen treat. Hey, at least you can look at people on the Strip and when they back you can wave at them! I'm above you! Yay!"

But as soon as you walk inside, Serendipity was underwhelming, boxy, and nothing special!  So we were glad to sit outside on the patio, even though it was your typical 100 degree day in Vegas!\n\nThe Food\nThe menu options were plentiful - a little something for everyone.  We were all in a burger mood - Carrie (yours truly :P) ordered the veggie burger (I only ate half, that says it all!),  and Miranda had the crab cake burger (which she let me taste - now THAT was worth looking a little bulgy in your Vegas clubbing dress for!)  Charlotte and Samantha both ordered a traditional burger that they both inhaled (they were quiet for a good ten minutes lol!)  Not that I could blame them, we all didn't have a bite to eat since 5am that morning coming home from Surrender! ;)\n\nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate\nSigh.  Serendipity's trademark drink was nothing but hot chocolate served cold with whipped cream, literally.  No \"how did they do that?!?\" reaction like when I ordered deep-fried ice cream for the first time.   I envisioned some kind of chocolate slushy!\n\nThe Serendipitous Moment\nSo the four girlfriends sat around their table, chatting, laughing, and devising grandiose plans for the night ahead, while picking at their French fries.  The food might've been just OK (maybe we should've just done dessert here instead of dinner!)  but we all agreed it was great place to spend some quality time with each other (outside of all the drinking & dancing the last two nights away.)   That was a nice, accidental discovery....that was Serendipity :)"

Although I do think that the frozen hot chocolate is tasty idea, there is no way that it merits the exorbitant price the establishment demands. I realize that it is smack-dab in the middle of the strip, but if it makes me think that a fifteen dollar martini is reasonable by comparison, then something is straight up ILL. \n\nTo boot, the food is not that great - bowling alley fare at best, and even that is a stretch considering some of the good bar food I've eaten in some of the local bowling alleys - Did I just undermine my credibility there? Haha - what can I say? I do love the ghetto fab grub as much as the next gourmet meal!"

We were only there for their ever so popular sundaes so we didn't have to look at the menu for so long. It took them another 15 minutes or so to come back and ask for our orders. We just wanted a banana split.\n\nFortunately, the sundae didn't take too long to come out. It was really good. The ice cream was very creamy and not too sweet at all. Usually I hate sundaes because the ice cream is already so overwhelming without all the toppings, but this place made it just right. \n\nOverall, I really liked this place. It was very colorful and bright. Very cute. The ice cream was actually really good. The food was pricey, but for a fun experience is was worth it. My only complaint is that long waits.

            "review": "Came to Caesars Palace to go shopping at the Forum shops and stopped by here for lunch on a recent visit to Vegas. This place is a major tourist trap. I guess it was alright for a one time kitschy/novelty thing, but I won't be coming back anytime soon and here's why:\n\n- The food was way overpriced and there was nothing different or impressive about it at all. Had the frozen hot chocolate for 2 ($14), chicken not so little soup ($10) and cheeseburger with steak fries ($16). The frozen hot chocolate is just like iced hot chocolate with whipped cream and slivers of chocolate sprinkled on top...you can get something very similar or even better at starbucks (chocolate chip frappuccino) or jamba juice (chocolate moo'd) for less than half the cost, or just go to 7-Eleven and buy a bottle of yoo-hoo. The soup portion was tiny, like the size of a regular coffee mug. The cheeseburger was slightly burnt, although the steak fries was probably the best part of the whole meal. To be fair, I guess prices are standard for this part of the strip but the food was just so mediocre...Kinda like a crappier version of Cheesecake Factory food with less variety to choose from. I will give them credit for coming up with creative names for menu items, but that's just another part of the marketing gimmick.\n\n- Wait time to get seated took forever. We were originally told wait time would be an hour and a half. After waiting for about 45 minutes, we overheard the hostess telling another couple that outside seating on the patio was available immediately. Outdoor seating was not originally offered to us and we wasted 45 minutes of precious gambling/shopping time! Tip: if hostess tells you a ridiculously long wait time to get a table, ask to sit at the bar (for smaller parties) or an outdoor table (although it can get cold even with the heat lamps).\n\n- Service time took forever again. Come on...an order of soup and a cheeseburger...how basic can you get? It really shouldn't take over half an hour.\n\nSave yourself 2+ hours and $50+...Don't get sucked into the hype! This place is popular only because their cutesy name is still riding the coat tail fame of a 9 year old movie...sad!"

And yes I have to admit we came here because we did want to try their frozen hot chocolate but decided not to get it and got a frozen hot Oreo chocolate Instead (close enough).\n\nAfter spending $100 I'd have to say I'm pretty upset. Our server Phoenix had the personality of a ..of a.. Doorknob. Yes it's mean but when you have  a server that doesn't even greet you, and first words out of her mouth was, \"what do you guys want to drink?\". No introduction whatsoever.  Found her name on our receipt. \n\nHubby ordered the steak and eggs for $27. The steak was about 1 centimeter thick, heavily seasoned with pepper. He asked for egg whites for his scramble and Phoenix said they don't do egg whites... What kind of a breakfast/brunch restaurant doesn't have egg whites?  \n\nI ordered the corn beef hash, I preferred the sour dough toast that went along with it. 3 bites of my hash and I was done. Salty, watery for some reason and it had a very sour note to it, not corn beef hash sour but lemon sour for some reason. \n\nNote* we both received our food lukewarm. \n\nI ordered the caffe serendip, a coffee with cinnamon. Don't waste your money on it.  $5 on the menu but was charged $6. Hubby wanted to leave so I didn't even bring it up to the server. Also I only use brown sugar in my coffee and so I asked Phoenix for brown sugar.. She came back after 15 minutes when my coffee was cold and said \"we ran out of brown sugar..\" Okaaaay, again a breakfast spot that runs out of brown sugar and no egg whites. \n\nOrdered off the kids menu for my daughter, french toast 2 slices  halved for $8.95, no sides so I Added some scrambled eggs for another $3. At least my daughter enjoyed the eggs. Oh and another $3 for a glass of whole milk. \n\n\n\nNeedless to say we aren't coming back."

Service was not up to par with the majority of the strip but the atmospher, especially if you sit outside makes it better.  I Got the Challah French toast which would be good if you have never had French toast made with delicious Jewish holiday egg bread but was mediocre for what it is.  I probably could make one better(and it would be stuffed with cookie butter from Trader Joe's :D ) \n\nI was craving lunch as well so I ordered the summer brie's which is a pumpernickel raisin bread sandwich with turkey, alfalfa sprouts, sliced apples and the overall decision maker for me, melted brie.  The sandwich  was good, but not great and I always have high hopes for a sandwich that has such promise and all the neccessary components of a perfectly balanced sandwich.  \n\nDuring my 2nd visit, I had a much better experience.  My friend Dindi told me how amazing the frozen hot chocolate was and I did not hesitate to find out for myself.\nI was unaware of how EPIC Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate is.  Got two different flavors: a white chocolate frooooozen and a Peanut Butter frooooozen.  \n\nAll I could think was HOLY COW......I am going to convert to Hinduism.  \n\nTastes just like hot chocolate, the other flavors in the drink only make it better, and I will DEFINITELY stop at the walk up counter outside when I am entering or leaving Ceasar's Palace.  \n\nAs for the food this time around...much better all around.  \n\nI got the crab cake sandwich and not anything about this sandwich was on point.  The crab cake tasted fresh, was not fishy, had a perfect amount of sauce and toppings and was definitely not skimpy with the crab cakes.  \n\nMy favorite dish that I have had thus far from Serendipity was their steak sandwich.  Came on footlong Italian bread, mayo, lettuce, tomato, basically two separate cuts of steak and three sunny side up eggs.  MUAH!\nWashed this monster of a sandwich down with a root beer, Death Valley Root Beer to be exact, which is even tastier, creamier, and richer since they have it on draught.  \n\nEnded my 2nd visit to Serendipity and my weekend in Las Vegas with a bang, with a carrot cake sundae.  BOMB...ORDER THIS.  ***Just note this dessert is ridiculously rich, so for those not the mood for dessert or are not much on sweets, I would not recommend***"

Reading the menus posted on the outside was giving me a headache, with its hard to read fonts and lack of prices posted.\n\nThe fare is very typical American/Italian fare - pizza, pasta, burgers, etc. Their signature seems to be the frozen hot chocolate. The frozen hot chocolate was large and tasty but it was a rather hefty $13 for one.\n\nThe wagyu sliders were a bit dry. The creamy tomato soup was in fact rather chunky. It was good but definitely not worth the $9 or whatever it was that we paid. The penne ala vodka pasta looked decent but once again, super overpriced. The bacon lettuce tomato (BLT) actually had turkey in the sandwich, and it was a rather large sandwich.\n\nService was fine."

I heard they are opening on in Washington soon. We sat inside and ordered the T-BLT and a frrrozen hot choco ($10). They realy piled on the turkey. It was real good. We didn't get to finish the sweet potato fries but they were good. Frrrozen hot choco was really good. I am not a big choco person, but this was yum!\nP.S. I think the frrrozen hot choco is bigger in NYC."

If you don't have time to sit and enjoy the experience, def. do the to-go line outside, but I won't lie, you will probably find yourself waiting/spending the same time outside as you would have to be seated and served indoors. \n\nThis place reminds me of a real life Mary Poppin's extravaganza. The food is fun, whimsical, and overly delicious. The Frozen Hot Chocolate is HUGE and to die for: served with two straws for sharing (awwwwweeee) and a big pile of whip cream on top! #winning \n\nCome hungry and bring money - while it is delish, it is also overpriced, but hey!

I also tried one of their frozen hot chocolates for dessert. Now that was GOOD! Our waiter was awesome. His name was David. They forgot to bring out our milkshake so he took it off the bill as well as the frozen hot chocolate. We thought that was really nice of him so we gave him a very good tip. He had great customer service skills. I think this is a great place for dessert and not so much to eat, its possible their other food is better."

Another waitress accidentally bumped her and our waitress gave her the dirtiest look and I swear was about to punch her in the face. She acted more like a biker chick then waitress. The other blonde waitress practically ran for her life. Next, she only came to take our order, deliver our food and give the bill. Never came to check on us or anything. When she did silver the food she was looking at another table and switched our orders.\n\n2. The ice cream was mediocre. Nothing special really. Yes, large portions and the raspberry sauce was tasty but def not worth the large $14 dollar price. I'd rather go to cold stone. \n\n3. The frozen hot chocolate, their original hit  was okay, just wasn't a big fan of it. Maybe it's cause I'm not a big fan of hot chocolate I begin with.\n\n4. The food was horrible! Of course I didn't get a meal myself but I did try my daughters. Leilah downed it but I base that on the fact she didn't eat breakfast and her favorite dish is spaghetti. My friend and I both tried it an swore Chef boyardee was better."

We had called to make reservations and they sounded like it was hard to make them.  However when we arrived it was pretty empty.  A sad sight really.  Once seated, we went for their Onion Rings ($10), Nachos ($12), and Frozen Hot Chocolate ($15) off their cute little menus.  We wanted to order more food to share but the waiter stopped us and said the portions are huge.  We were glad because when the food came out we were shocked.  The onion ring tower was massive.  It came with BBQ sauce and ranch on the side.  It was perfectly crispy on the outside and super hot and good in the inside.  The nachos were a little disappointing to me.  It contained chips, guac, barely any salsa, sour cream, japalenos, shredded beef and chicken, nacho cheese, and green onions.  Our nachos looked different compared to other people's Yelp nachos photos.  I did not like that all the ingredients were spread out.  For example, the sour cream was a scoop on one side, the chicken was on one side, and the salsa was a small scoop.  Everything was also dried the **** out.  Yes it was big, but quality over quantity.  However, I did like that the tortilla chips were seasoned and flavored.  As, for the frozen hot chocolate, we got their original 16 oz one.  It was the perfect size to share.  It was delicious and we would get it again.  I loved the delicious chocolate flakes on top.  \n\nOur total was about $35.  The portions were HUGE and we had a lot of left overs that we didn't care to take back to our hotel.  I thought the pricing was cheap for the portions.  I think the desserts here are amazing but the food is whatever.  Other items for food on the menu include salads, burgers, hot dogs, pizzas and pastas.  Other dessert items include milk shakes, sundaes, pies and cakes.  Their popular frozen hot chocolate come in many options including peanut butter, mint chocolate, and strawberry.  They also have a brunch menu, kids menu, and full bar.  \n\nThe inside of this place is cute but it looks like it needs to be renovated.  The diner/pink vibe is cute but those hideous colorful lights needs to go.  It definitely looks cuter in photos then in person.  Everything also looks old and worn down.  We sat inside but they have outdoor seating as well.  As for service, the guy who waited on us was nice and gave great recommendation.  However, since the game was on, he was fixated on that with his co-workers instead of checking on us so service was slow.  The food came out pretty fast though.  Overall, it was a good first experience.  I would come back to try their hot dogs but other dessert items but that's about it.  Also be fine not coming back."

One of the visits was less than great with a very long wait for lukewarm food.  On this last trip we went for dinner twice.  The first night I had the heirloom tomato salad and my friend ordered the chicken strips.  The salad is amazing! Huge, ripe tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and the best honey mustard dressing.  It also had some sort of nuts on it that tasted like pine nuts.  Fresh basil was sprinkled on top.  The chicken strips were really good.  The batter is tempura so it was light and crispy. The chicken was juicy and there was a lot of it.  On the second trip, I had the same salad and we tried the \"can't say no\" sundae.  Peanut butter pie with vanilla and coffee ice cream, bananas, whipped cream and chocolate sauce.  It was so good and 2 of us were only able to finish half of one sundae.  I love this place and will stop by each time we go to vegas.  The service is great sometimes and less than great sometimes.....but that is true for most restaurants in Vegas.  The frozen hot chocolate is just so-so.  Nothing exciting...but the sundaes are great! And the apple pie dessert is wonderful.  I always request to sit on the patio because inside is very loud and feels like a cafeteria.  The patio is less crowded and has a great view of either ceasars or the strip."

Based on their fun menu, I thought we'd be blown away by their dishes. Wrong.\n\nI had their chicken and waffles. Should have skipped it. The portion itself was a good size. The waffles were quartered and was pretty good. Touch of sweetness and light and fluffy. But the chicken, boy was I hoping for more. It had good flavor but the skin was not the crispy, crackling skin you'd hoped for. I could tell it was sitting under a heat lamp as it started to have that stale bite.\n\nYou'll notice my operative word: good. That's just how I can best describe Serendipity. It was good, not great. BUT if I was basing it on their desserts, then yes, they deserve an additional star. They come in these heaping bowls that are big enough for 4...maybe even more depending on your love of sweets.  I'll pass on the frozen hot chocolate as it wasn't amazing like everyone says. So if you plan on giving into the calories, get the Can't Say No sundae. It's just that, you can't deny the peanut butter pie slice plopped atop a mountain of ice cream and whipped cream that is so satisfying.\n\nThis review pretty much did a 360 but hope it all made sense. Go for the dessert, not the food. Plain and simple."

I was starving and it was literally one of the first places besides Margaritaville that I saw. It was way too early, at 11:30am, for margaritas (although I know it's Vegas--I had my share the night before), so we went to Serendipity. It looked cute and I thought they were serving brunch (it was Friday). \n\nAnyway, we go in and the front is packed, but when we came through the back way there seemed to be a ton of seating available. We were told that the wait would be 30 to 40 minutes. We decided to wait. Anywho, about an hour later we were pretty annoyed so we went inside to check our status. We were told we were coming up next, yet about four other parties or so were seated ahead of us. We basically waited another 20 minutes. At this point I'm beyond annoyed (did I mention it was my 30 bday and I was nursing a slight headache so the fact that I had no food was turning me into a beast?). We are finally seated and it takes a little while to order our food, and then forever to get it. Turns out that they didn't have brunch so I had to order from the lunch menu. \n\nI ordered a burger that had avocado and caramelized onions. I think it might have had some cheese on it as well...this immediately tells you how I felt about the burger. It was so tasteless and forgettable. I mean, I tried to put salt on it to bring out some flavor and it just went nowhere. \n\nI don't recommend this place. There has to be other spots that have way better food, with less wait time."

Luckily, there weren't many people there at the time and the service was very fast. \n\nFirst, we started with the nachos for the appetizer.  They were huge.  We could have eaten this and then left.  They were pretty good and they were loaded.  Lots of cheese, beef, and even had guac and sour cream.  For nachos, they were definitely acceptable.\n\nShe got a burger and I had the hangover omelet.  A few bites in and we were stuffed.  There was no way we could finish it all.  If we did, I expected to be comped my meal for completing the challenge.\n\nHer burger was ok. Nothing special but not bad as well.  My omelet was the same.  Not much to report here expect again that they were huge.  \n\nIf you want something right on the strip, you are extremely hungry, or want to share a meal, go to this place.  The food is good, not great, not bad, and they have a very diverse menu.  Variety and excess portions are the spice of life right?"

I was only 11 when I watched the movie but I vowed to travel to New York one day just to try it! So when I heard Serendipity was on The Strip, I knew I just had to stop by.\n\nThe wait would have been about 15-30 minutes but the hostess claimed that we \"missed\" our call, even though our party walked right over when she called my name. Not only did she make us wait an additional 15 minutes while she let two parties walk up without a wait and were seated right away, GREAT. So I sucked it up and put a smile on my face and continued to wait.\n\nFrom the over-sized menus, I ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two and the onion rings (they're ginormous!) My boyfriend got the high heel pumps, an Italian style sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. The food wasn't anything special but we had a nice lunch.\n\nOur hostess was very friendly and we enjoyed her until she had taken away our onion rings without asking. Of course, I complained and they were quite accommodating to the matter. \n\nOverall, I wasn't happy with my experience here. I'm disappointed that they did not live up to my childhood dreams. I probably wouldn't come back unless I have a hankering for frozen hot chocolate, which btw was guilty delicious! And even at that, I'd probably just head to the to-go window"

After a weekend of endless walking, buffets, and sight-seeing, I was ready to end my Vegas trip with a simple, light lunch. Even though this place was probably one of the cheapest places that I ate at in Vegas, the experience wasn't worth this price.\n\nWe arrived at Serendipity 3 around noon and it was packed outside and inside. Choosing to sit inside, we got immediate seating. However, no server came to us at all for the first 15 minutes. Needing to catch a flight within 2 hours, I flagged down any random waitress nearby to take down our orders. She was incredibly polite and apologetic for our long wait (it took 30 minutes for our food to come out). I appreciated that she made a great effort to make sure we were satisfied with our experience. My boyfriend and I had a coupon that allowed us to get a free frozen hot chocolate as long as we ordered an entree. He ordered an \"A.B.C.\" burger (avocado, brie, and caramelized onions) with steak as the meat (the other option is chicken) and his choice of steak fries for the side; I ordered a mac and cheese. Our total came out to be roughly $33 (without tip), which is unfortunately as cheap as it's going to get for a simple meal in Vegas (unless you choose something from Chinatown or McDonalds).\n\nA.B.C. Burger + Steak Fries\nI normally would never touch steak or any other beef item, but wow this burger was delicious. I had a nibble of my boyfriend's medium rare steak topped with melted brie and fresh avocado and loved the combination of A, B, & C in this burger. However, I'd say the BEST thing I ate for this lunch was the steak fries. They were meaty yet crunchy and salty but not thirst-inducing. I don't even know how to describe how wonderful the steak fries were. My boyfriend describes these fries as the best he ever had (next to the fries that he ate on one of his Celebrity cruise line cruises, which tasted incredibly similar). \n\nMac & Cheese\nI don't know how or why Las Vegas activated my cheese addiction, but I couldn't resist ordering this simple comfort-food staple. The macaroni used for this dish was perfect: large tender shells that held the fluid, creamy cheese and slightly crusted on top. The metal pot that the mac and cheese was served in looked small, but, to my own surprise, this was the first time I didn't finish a cheese dish! I wish i had though (just writing about it right now is making my mouth water)! \n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate\nI was somewhat amused by the oxymoron in the name when I first heard about Serendipity's famous trademarked dessert. Contrary to its name, this dessert isn't actually frozen. But it truly is somewhat of a contradiction. It's frozen enough to be eaten with a spoon but melted enough to be drunk with a straw; it's cold enough to enjoy as a dessert but warm enough to enjoy as a sweet, creamy smoothie. My boyfriend claimed this dessert for himself, and even though it couldn't beat out the steak fries for best part of our meal, it came incredibly close. It's definitely a must-try if you're anywhere near Caesar's Palace and crave a unique dessert!"

For those that want take out... they also have windows that you can order from on the side.\n\nThe service was great!  Our waitress was very friendly.  She took the time to go over the menu with us when we asked for a recommendation.  And when we ordered our food... we ordered something on the side, but when it arrived it wasn't exactly how we asked.  She took notice and immediately made the change before we could say anything.\n\nThe food was great and the portions were definitely filling.  We even had enough to take back to the hotel for a later snack.  We had the rock shrimp appetizer (can't go wrong with shrimp) and ordered a single chili cheese dog to share.  This thing was no regular sized hot dog in a regular sized bun.  It was pretty big... (that's what she said).  But really... this chili dog with a side of fries definitely does the job.  Let's not get too carried away on the portions 'cause what good is a lot of food if it tastes like crap?  No worries here.  It was definitely good.  Toward the end of our meal we had the frrrozen hot chocolate (for free, courtesy of The Flamingo).  Imagine a \"hot\" chocolate on ice, with whipped cream and sprinkled bits of chocolate, topped with a bit of awesomeness.  If this drink isn't slap-you-in-the-face good, I will gladly do it for you.\n\nFor the good service, good food, and nice atmosphere... I give Serendipity five stars."

            "review": "Just returned from a Vegas weekend and this restaurant and service was just terrible. The layout of the restaurant should have been better to accommodate size and demands of tourists and visitors instead of only being able to service the basic size of a mom & pop shop. It has a great area for outdoor seating but the shade and covering or cooling was not enough for Nevada 104+ F demands. The host and service was NOT great at all and good luck trying to find a seat and service with a party greater than 3. We were forced to wait an hour and a half in 104 F when we just had to give up because although we confronted the host as to why several parties were being let in (parties of 1 & 2), our party of 5 is just too big for them and it's easier to let people with smaller parties in. So very rude and not worth the wait.\n\nMy highest recommendations to you, if you're willing to pay the same amount for Serendipity 3 go inside Caesars with A/C and comfy seating and shade. Find a bakery called Payard's Patisserie and get their drinks and pastries, just the same price (perhaps portions are smaller regarding pastries but they are in French style-size, drinks are huge) and BONUS they give free samples.\n\nWill fly to NYC for the original shop and avoid this mock."

We waited for an outdoor table on a beautiful afternoon - 12:30 pm on Monday (4/09).  \n\nWe got seated About 45 minutes later at a great table facing the boulevard.  For such a long wait I wasn't sure why their were multiple empty tables outside.  This place could turn over much more money if they filled them.  Their profit isn't my problem though.  We soon figured out why the tables weren't full.  They were most likely severely short staffed.  Although, since there were three hostesses to seat, one wouldn't have assumed so.  \n\nWe sat and sat and sat. No acknowledgement.  No water.  No \"I'll be right with you\".  20 minutes and nothing.  Not a word.  Perhaps, they thought the view was enough.  One waitress passed us and we tried to get her attention, but she looked in the opposite direction as she passed.  So, 20 minutes going onto 25 minutes and this is added to the 45 min wait for a table.  We ended up walking out.  Why are we going to pay our hard earned dollars for food plus tip when there was a clear problem here.  \nWho knows how long the food would have taken to arrive.  \n\nWe went elsewhere and then came back for that frozen hot chocolate to-go.  The short, it wasn't anything special.  It was good.  But we truly are the dummies for paying an absurd ($15) amount for a humdrum to-go milkshake.  \n  \nHow upsetting that for as often as I go to Vegas I can neither recommend not go back."

We were there early and still weren't seated until about 30 minutes later o Ly to be informed they had a table ready the entire time but never sent anyone to get us....\n\nThe food- the food selection looked really good on the menu. Everything is a tad on the pricey side, but oh well, this place is famous right? It kind of took a while to bring our food out and I have some gripes about that. They forgot one meal, one breakfast came out super cold like it's been sitting for a whiiiile, and my omelet was like super-cooked hard and dry. So 3 misses out of about 14 people, I guess I'll let it slide?\n\nBUT, and this is a big but. They quickly resolved this issue by comping the meal they forgot and the meal that came out cold (and brought out a brand new one) (I didn't complain about my meal bc I don't like complaining at restaurants), and on top of that, gave us 2 frrrozen hot chocolates and a bloody Mary for our meal that was cold. \n\nSo all in all, the food was ok, the desserts and sweets are yummy, and the service ended up being great since they fixed everything they messed up. \n\nI will come here again and update my review and hopefully I'll have a 5-star experience next time!"

It's located just outside of Caesar's Palace, and is considered one of the more \"affordable\" restaurants in Vegas.  I put affordable in quotes, because it's obviously a relative term.  It's still not exactly cheap, but the food and desserts are both really good.  First off, the portion size of the sandwiches and burgers are huge.  I had a burger on our first visit, It had bacon and blue cheese on it, and came with a ton of fries.   Their sandwiches could most definitely be split between two people if you aren't starving hungry.  If you eat a whole sandwich or burger by yourself, trust me you won't have room for dessert.  My wife and I learned this on our second trip, as we simply spilt a chicken sandwich and fries, which was more than plenty for the both of us.\n\nWe splurged and got this cookie sundae for dessert.  It was huge!  It came with a few scoops of cookie dough ice cream, and had a few homemade cookies on top, along with hot fudge and whipped cream.  Makes me hungry just thinking about it now.  If you split a meal and a dessert, you can walk out of here for less than $40 including tip.  Some folks may consider that expensive.  Again, affordable is a relative term. :)  \n\nI'm a big fan of this place, and would go back here anytime.  I have to thank my wife for helping discover this place.  Check it out if you're in Vegas!"

Most of their items come in HUGE portions, so I guess it kind of makes up for the price. \n\nThe wait for seating in the restaurant is pretty bad, but the nice thing is that you can put your name down and they text you when your table is ready.  This enables you to go walk around inside Cesar's palace and explore and play while waiting.  This also enabled me to grab a few drinks at their \"to-go\" counter at the front.  They ran out of whatever they use to make smoothies--and whenever someplace can't get a handle on their inventory I dock stars.  I got the hot chocolate and it was pretty good and filled me up enough to last until we were called for brunch.\n\nService is SO slow here, which is definitely a downer when you've been waiting so long for your table in the first place.  I could have sworn there was only one server in charge of the whole patio area on Sunday brunch.\n\nI got the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs and my boyfriend got the Crab Cake Benedict.  I really liked the corned beef hash, because you could tell they had cured and prepared the meat themselves so it was definitely fresh. The Crab Cake Benedict was also very good, but was a smaller portion compared to everything else and much higher priced--but I guess that should be expected for seafood during brunch.\n\nI do want to try their $90+ treasure chest dessert someday though.\n\nOverall, the food is good but not mindblowing, and the portions are huge. But with all the amazing restaurants in Vegas, you can get a better deal for your money elsewhere."

To his credit he did not charge me for the sliders (they were a health hazard) and gave us a 20% discount for the poor kitchen performance. \n- Speed of the kitchen:  The restaurant was not terribly busy, yet still our order took more than 30 minutes to arrive.  \n- Drink quality:  Mixed drinks were weak and expensive.  My wife had a $14 basic, frozen margarita and she couldn't taste the tequila.  I had a $10 basic bourbon & water, and it was weak, too.  \n- Prices: You pay for convenient location on the strip, in front of Caesar's Palace.  A $14 house frozen margarita?  Come on.   \n\nOverall:  \nMy whole family was deeply disappointed in this experience.  We paid $102 for a basic dinner for a family of five, and that includes no charge for the raw slider hamburgers, a 20% discount for the rest of the bill, and a 20% tip for the waiter for his terrific service.  The manager was nice, and did not push back at all once he saw the raw sliders, so I appreciate his response.   I have had worse.  Still, I was disappointed.  So was my family."

That girl sucked. She was one of those servers that just goes through the motions and truly doesn't give a crap about any part of the experience. I ordered a diet coke, hoping to get some caffeine in my veins to wake me up after a day at the pool, and she didn't deliver it until she brought the food. Over half an hour had gone by so I figured she forgot and I was okay with just giving up on it. I was shocked when she did bring it, but it was obvious this was some sort of \"do less work\" strategy so she didn't want to have to keep refilling it for me, so instead I paid $5 for one little glass of diet coke. Awesome. She never smiled once and completely disappeared when it was time to give us our check, take our credit card, and return it to us. It took so long I was standing there with my purse on my shoulder for a really long time, trying to send her a message that we were more than ready to stop inconveniencing her by being her table. We always tip whichever is greater between $10 flat and 20%, and it broke my heart to not be able to leave her anywhere near that, but she didn't deserve the 15% we did give her. \n\nIf you do dine at this restaurant, ask for Laura M.!

It sounded good, so we decided to return for breakfast the following day.\n\nLittle did we know how busy it would be the next morning! This sure is a popular spot! We gave our cell phone number to the hostess who said it'd be a good 15-20 minute wait and she'd text us when our table is ready. We went outside (it was FREEZING out, as it was a cold December morning with a bitter wind). The family ordered some coffees and hot chocolates at their \"To Go\" window on the outside of the place, at the rear of the restaurant (not facing the Strip). The Coffee \"Serendip\" was a hit with my teen kid with its undertones of nutmeg and other wintry spices. \n\nWe got the hostess' text after a 20 minute wait and were seated at a table inside. Our waitress was pleasant and gave us menus soon after, but it took another 10 minutes for her to return to take our orders, and then it took 37 minutes for us to get our orders! That's a long time for a hungry family to wait. \n\nWhen the food came, it was good. Hubby and one kid had the hot wings, which they really liked. The plates were quite large; large enough to feed two people per plate, easy. My other kid ordered the \"Bigger than your Head\" pancakes. They were humongous and she could barely eat one (let alone two). She said it was \"okay, but rather doughy\". I just ordered a poached egg, which was fine (hard to mess that up, though, I guess!). All in all, I'd say the food is average to perhaps a bit above average, but the portions are so so big and that can be a bit of a turn-off for some (best to be prepared to share dishes, I think). I'd also recommend coming here at off-times, between meal times, perhaps, as the lines and the wait can be pretty dang long."

The staff has been generally friendly and I'll get to the food in a minute... \n\nIt's been a minute..If you can get past the wacky setup (and the fact you have to walk outside, around the building and through a deserted hallway to use the restroom), you have your pick of enormous eats on this joint's menu! \n\nTHE NACHOS ARE OUTSTANDING! I did venture away from my nacho comfort zone and ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza but...stick to CPK for that little diddy. The pizza was ALL crust, little cheese & toppings..nuff said. \n\nDesert. If you are looking to live on the edge and you want to partake in a desert for dinner evening, this would be your place! DELICIOUS, FATTENING, and FANTASTIC!!! \n\nSo, I give this place 3 stars mainly for their bangin nachos, and decent staff, but it loses the last two stars for layout, location, and well, everything except the food, drinks and staff, haha!"

Once I had the desserts at the NY location I see why, it was worth the wait!\n\nThe Vegas location had a 1-hour long wait, we opted to go to the express line and that went fairly quick. Go to the pick-up window if you are short on time.\n\nWe had the On the Go Banana Split, some huge foot-long hot dog and some frozen hot chocolate drink.\n\nThe food is pretty good it fills the bill, desserts are their forte. Would I come back yes, it a novelty thing.\n\nThe portions for the frozen hot-chocolate are big enough for 3 to 4 people.\n\nI recommend making reservation if you like to eat inside. If you eat outside there is a big tent so have somebody in your group stake out a table while somebody places the order. My point, it gets crowded here fast.\n\nKid-friendly - yes.\nFun with groups - yes\n\nParking - at one near by casinos. If you park at the Caesars self-park you will have to navigate through the casino, just ask one of the staff members on how to get to this place.\n\nIf you are in the mood for this type of food and you are unable to get in this place, just further up is a placed called \"Shake Shack\". I have not been to the Vegas location but I know the one in NYC is a home-run!"

I thought that this place must be amazing.\nOur hostess had no personality and did not make us feel welcomed. We sat down in 35 and got a patio seating. I was thrilled. This is when it went down hill. Our server apparently touched our table and said she would be there in a minute . I didn't even know who she was. 25 min went by and still no server. This place obviously doesn't have team work because NO ONE came by. My friend pointed out our server and she just kept walking circles around us. I had to ask te host to find our server for us ( where she said yes but felt is necessary to keep setting tables). GUEST ARE YOUR 1st PRIORITY!! We asked to see a mgr. Who kindly expedited our food out quickly. Our runner ( older blonde) was friendly and and made sure we had everything thing. Our server never came by to check on us . O refills. Never smiled. Ugh! It just made the whole experience aggravation! I was irritated and never wanted to come back here again. Then , she had the nerves to put a 18% grat. F' her! Why should I reward terrible service . The only reason she got a tip is because 1 of my friends felt bad. I left 0 tip on my share and same withe others around me! Older middle aged lady with brown hair!

Hoping that Serendipity would live up to it's bragging rights as a great dessert shop, and at a really good location, I was slightly disappointed.\n\nNow, first, lets just talk about the positives about the shop. I think the frozen hot chocolates does live up to its expectation. It is amazing, and delicious! We had the classic Serendipity regular hot chocolate, and the amaretto hot chocolate. My favorite was the amaretto. I would definitely go back to try it again, and I can almost be sure that sometime soon I will crave for it (come spring or summer time). Judging by the price comparison that was described on the photo captions on their yelp page, and their menu, it looks like the prices have gone up. We paid $13  for the hot chocolate size that fits for two. The portion is big and it was good enough for three people to feel satisfied, and less guilty. The onion ring tower was ok. It is seasoned with grated Parmesan, and it comes with a BBQ and Ranch as dipping sauces. We also had the lobster and artichoke dip with bruschetta slices. That was about $13, and felt really robbed. 8 small pieces of bread and  miniature cup of dipping? I wanted to cause a scene for that ridiculousness! \n\nNow the bad side, the service is freaking horrible. I mean, seriously seriously bad. I'm pretty easy going and it's very hard to let me down, but on the day of my birthday when everything was going great the one thing that slightly destroyed it all was the service. The hostesses weren't really doing their job. We had no welcoming greet, no small talk, and I even saw frowns on their faces! Then, our server Jessie didn't really tend to us very much. She asked us only ONCE if we wanted more water and that was AFTER she gave us the check? She never even checked up on us, and the place was freaking slow! Her \"have a nice day\" just seemed so insincere and animated. I just felt like I was completely disregarded, and that I was some person who didn't deserve some decent service because I didn't \"look\" the part or something. I just felt so bad..i mean this is the second worst service I've ever had and the first was McDonald's! But I can't even blame them because they are probably slaving in the kitchen at a low paying wage! \n\nWork at McDonald's flipping burgers if you aren't gonna even TRY to give good service! For the price I fork up for freaking frozen hot chocolate I should at least get decent service."

I pretty much could have stood there all day long as no one took the time to acknowledge me until at least a good ten minutes. Clearly lacking in customer service skills people.

No real reason for that, we have noticed the long lines for the restaurant on many occasions.  We went there on Monday at 11:30 am for lunch.  We had made reservations after reading Yelp reviews talking about having to frequently wait for a table.  At no time did we incur rude service.  Everybody was friendly.  We are used to Strip prices, so we weren't shocked by $15 sandwiches.  They did come with fries or for a $1 more, sweet potato fries.  \n\nWe were starving.  We ordered a Hawaiian pizza as other people nearby had them and they looked good.  It was quite good, didn't realize it was made with BBQ sauce but there was plenty of cheese and the crust was very good.  \n\nThe wife had a chicken sandwich and said it was very good.  It was good sized.  The sweet potato fries were probably the best we have ever had.  They were cooked long enough where they were crisp.  Plus, they put cinnamon on them.  I had the Rueben sandwich.  The corn beef was exceptionally lean and the rye bread was very good.  I wish it would have had a little more sauerkraut on it, but that was minor.  \n\nFor dessert, we got a piece of red velvet cake to go.  It was $14, way too much for my taste.  It was very good.  We did take a little more than half of our food home with us in the best carry-out containers we have ever seen.  \n \nWe didn't have the frozen hot chocolate, just because paying $11 seemed like an excess we couldn't take.  I wish I hadn't paid the $4 upcharge to get four onion rings instead of the fries.  The rings are heavily coated with parmesan cheese.  We love onion rings, but these just didn't cut the mustard.  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  The food was very good.  The wait person was very friendly.  Unfortunately, you can't be in a hurry to get your food.  Our wait person was working hard, but it took an extremely long time to get our meal.  The follow-up wasn't great, but not terrible.  Perhaps they should consider having some food runners.  The food was served at a good temperature, it just took forever.  All desserts that we saw were MASSIVE!"

It's the same as the regular frozen hot chocolate, only they add a scoop of chocolate ice cream.  Ahhhh I'm salivating just thinking about it...\n\nMake a reservation for a table outside against the railing and you can people watch while you eat your meal :)  Vegas definitely draws an eclectic crowd!"

When we got seated, there were plenty of tables......so what was the problem? \n\nI guess we got seated at a weird time because we couldn't order from the lunch menu because it was \"brunch\" still, even though \"lunch\" started 10 min later?  Whatever.  \n\nThe service was soooooooooooo slow -- it wasn't even busy.  The waiters were rude.  The food was not worth the wait or price.  The frozen hot chocolate tasted watered down, so I don't get why people rave about it.  \n\nIf you want food, go elsewhere.  If you want desserts, order from the takeout/to-go window I guess.

So about a month ago I made a reservation for Easter weekend and finally satisfied my craving/curiosity. I decided to get the smaller size of mint chocolate in a to go cup and could not finish it by myself! Delicious but definitely sweet. It tasted just like I thought it would but was a bit runnier than I expected; it's easier to sip it through the straws rather than use a spoon while walking. My friends' green tea one didn't resemble green tea at all, it was just over sugared. \n\nI arrived fifteen minutes early for my six person reservation at 5pm. I ended up changing it for three and we were seated under the burning sun, so we asked our waiter, Jason, if we could move to the one under some umbrellas. He quickly cleaned up the table and we ended up ordering an Asian chicken salad, ahi tuna salad, and chicken lettuce wraps. Notice it's all forms of greenery because we hit the buffet for brunch ... The Asian chicken salad dressing was yummy and not sour/spicy, had plenty of warm white meat chicken, and the chopsticks were a nice touch. The ahi tuna I snuck from my friends' plate was chilled on the inside and warm/chewy on the outside. I poured some of my Asian dressing on a chicken lettuce cup and don't regret it one bit. Their lettuce cups are fresh and such a healthy green color; the filling stayed on the inside because of the multiple cup layers holding it in. \n\nFood is good, l'll try the macaroni and cheese pizza next time. \n\n*Remember to show your gold Total Rewards card before paying to get one dollar off each entree you order."

The food and service here is excellent; I don't understand the mere three star overall rating. We made a dinner reservation a few days ahead and were seated almost immediately.  I ordered lettuce wraps with chicken and fried crispy noodles, which came with 3 different sauces: 1) chimi churro, 2) red Thai slightly spicy sauce, and 3) a peanut sauce, all of which were absolutely delicious. Mom ordered the burger without cheese and loved it, and also loved the saltiness of the fries. Sister and her bf ordered something else but not sure what... they enjoyed whatever they ordered though. Also tried the double frozen hot chocolate, which was nothing special... tasted just like a chocolate shake. However, it was still a tasty end to a delicious meal.\nMost surprising was the waitress's (can't remember her name, sadly) ability to remember all of our orders without even having to write them down.

As for sizing, order 1 up if you plan on sharing, unless you have a sweet tooth don't over spoil your experience with one. 4.25/5\n\nFrench Toast Logs: These sweet things were tailored fluffy and thick to allow for the syrup to be absorbed just right. Add their whipped cream that does not taste like your lucerne canned option at Ralph's, squeeze in a sweet berry and the bites taste like something you'd get at a breakfast cafe on Sunset (LA) or Coast Village Road (Santa Barbara). Oh and it comes with eggs and your choice of whatever choice breakfast spots always give you. 4.25/5\n\nService\n\nWhen you're on a light hangover you pay no attention to detail unless the service is so bad that it would not be a detail.

The food here is your typical american fare but with their own twists on it...and the portions are good enough for 2-3 people.  Lets get to the real nitty gritty of what makes this place so AMAZING ....Desserts!  The frozen hot chocolate is a goblet filled to the brim with coco goodness topped with home made whipped cream, the perfect antedote to a hot day in the desert.  Try also the Fried Oreo Sundae.  It has scoops of mocha ice cream topped with fudge and fried oreos hugging the ice cream into place.

We thought we'd grow old and die before being seated, so we checked out their other options: 1) the to-go line outside of the restaurant and 2) order to-go at the bar.\n\nIf you order to-go outside, you use a menu with limited options (but some of the same items are slightly cheaper than on the regular menu).  We don't go to Vegas often, so we decided to order at the bar and to just take our food to the tables outside of the hotel.  It was a nice option since the line was considerably shorter.\n\nWe ordered the black and white sundae ($15ish), a frozen hot chocolate ($9ish), and a grilled cheese sandwich ($15ish).  The prices were a bit of a kick in the pocketbook, but it all tasted great.  The grilled cheese sandwich had swiss, american, cheddar (I think?), and brie, and it was AMAZING.  It also came with yummy tomato soup.  I know they're famous for their frozen hot chocolate (which tastes exactly like how it sounds), but I actually enjoyed the black and white sundae more.\n\nThe seating sucked though. I know the area doesn't belong specifically to Serendipity 3, but c'mon, Ceasar's Palace!  Invest in a bus boy to clean up the tables at least once a century!  Especially if those tables sit right between your glitzy hotel and an expensive eatery!  It kind of ruined the ambiance eating our expensive, delicious food while sitting at sticky, filthy tables.

Either my drink had been sitting out too long before it got handed to me or she didn't blend it enough because it was more watery than thick. Seriously, I paid $10 for something that comes in a 16 oz. cup?!  I know better than to complain about prices when I'm in Vegas, but in my opinion, this one isn't worth it. \n\nThe worst part was the wait. It was a 30 min. wait just to get a table inside, so take out was the best option for us on the go. I wanted to munch on a cool Chinese Chicken salad since it was so hot outside, but it took 30 mins. just to get my food!  I followed up twice and waited right in front of the take out window so the lady handing out the food wouldn't have to search for me. Every time she catches my eyes, she says, \"oh, it's coming.\"  Really, it takes THIS long to get a salad?!? what are you guys doing? growing my lettuce?  The guy who placed his order after I did got his two Caesar salads and a whole pizza first. WTF. I was actually sorry that I even tipped her when she took my order in the beginning.\n\nNow I can say, been there, done that. Not going back unless someone else drags me here and pays for it."

We found out that it was in Cesar's palace and parked in the structure for free. We looked at a map to find the restaurant and got lost somewhere in the hotel. It was very confusing and a huge hotel but we finally found it outside on the other side of the courtyard area. We got there and there were a few tables full, so no need for the reservations. We ordered the frozen hot chocolate and an abc burger to split. We decided to get dessert to us first and that thing was pretty good! The flavor of the hot chocolate was rich and creamy. The ice was just enough to sip and spoon from. There was WAY to much whipped cream and I had to scoop it off. We got our burger which I asked for well done and it definitely came out pink. It was good for the burger not the meat which was cooked in some places and not others. I would have sent it back had I not eaten half of it and realized that it kept getting more raw the further i bite into it. It got to the point where I took the meat out and just ate everything else. We didn't see our server for most of the dinner. It my friend and I were talking so much and catching up that I didn't know if he was being nice and letting us chat or just a shitty waiter that never comes back to check up his guests. I would come back here just for the frozen hot chocolate but maybe try something different because $21 for a burger and fries is ridiculous!! Especially when they can't even cook it right!"

The fries met expectations, though the tartar sauce (?), I assume, had an aftertaste because of the metallic containment it was in. \n\nEven though the food was good and the prices were cheaper than I had expected since it is on the strip, my server wasn't up to par. If you sit inside, depending on where they seat you, you could possibly see the kitchen. I was disappointed that my server was touching her hair and face in the back of house area without washing her hands before handling our food. Though hair wasn't found on our plates, The lack of cleanliness was disappointing. Being in the f&b industry, and super anal about maintaining my professional, cleanly appearance, this was a definite turn-off. She wasn't personable at all, and treated my friend and I as if we were just young girls, as is familiar. She brought us water with apparent melted ice that indicated it was sitting there for a while. We asked for ice in the water for both of us, she brought us two new cups with ice filled to the rim. As I finished my food, she took away my plate and presented us with a check when my friend wasn't even half-way done with the meal; we might as well have ordered to-go! I still tipped her 20% just because I know tips are what we work for, but she definitely didn't deserve it. A meal is less appreciated when the service sucks.\n\nAlso, by all the other reviews I get from this place, by Yelpers, friends and family alike, I expected a better surrounding. The decor didn't live up Caesars palace. It was confusing figuring out whether the hostess was outside or inside. It was very awkward.\n\nI would still eat here again. And I'm sad I didn't try the frozen hot chocolate. Or the 1000$ gold sundae. Kidding. :P"

We weren't greeted or welcomed and he didn't even give us his name. Not even a smile and barely any eye contact whatsoever during the entire night. We tell him we were here for Restaurant Week (because there is a separate menu) and he had no idea what we were talking about and made that very clear in a rude manner. We were somewhat familiar with the menu items from viewing it online and asked if this or that was part of it and he would just reply \"yes\" or \"no\" and finally brought out the different menu.\n\nOur server never asked for our drink orders and had us choose all three courses right away and just brought out water afterwards. We only saw our server when he brought out the food or there were plates to be cleared. Getting a refill was nearly impossible. I had to get the attention of a hostess. I watched the server's interaction with his other tables and they were just as poor. We were hesitant to speak with a manager because we didn't want to risk our food being tampered with and waited until the end of our meal.\n\nThe manager was great and showed appreciation of the feedback but replied that our specific server had received numerous complaints. My concern then is why is this server still doing a bad job and why is he still employed? It looked as if he was angry or having a bad day but once you come to work, you leave that at the door. If it wasn't for the manager handling the situation the way he did, I would have never thought of coming back."

I always thought that service is excellent in LV, especially at higher-end places (and I would imagine that Caesar's falls into one of them).  Serendipity3 managed to break my bubble in this respect.\n\nBut you know, maybe that's because this place is actually not in Caesar's.  It's outside in a \"box\", as my friend described it.  Aside from the menu, the place doesn't really do a good job in copying the original.

I sat at the end of the bar where the staff would place the frozen hot chocolate (or any other items) that are ready to be delivered to the guests.  I have to tell you... they sat there really, really, really long time.  They pushed the food so close to me that I probably accidently spit in some of them while talking.  Sorry!\n\n#2.  Bartender actually made a wrong drink for one of the guests!  Now, you would think that they would toss that one out and make a new correct one.  What did they do instead?  They fudged that wrong drink by adding some elements (juice or whatever) to make it look like the one that the guest ordered.  How do I know all this?  Because they actually conversed loudly enough for me to hear it.\n\nI thought about giving 1 star, but just for the original sake, I am giving this a 2."

Serendipity!\n\nFrom Mandalay Bay, this was a long walk considering I was a little sore and tired.  The cafe is located just outside of Caesar's Palace and we took the tram to Excalibur, hopped over a few bridges, and arrived to discover there's a 30 minute wait.  Boo!\n\nIt was cold so we stayed inside and took in the decor.  It's a candy striped wall, plenty of pinks and girly stuff.  The girl inside of you will squeal in delight or be annoyed by all the pink stuff.  I didn't mind it too much.  \n\nWe got the pasta dish and the bacon cheeseburger. Our food wasn't bad but the pasta was overwhelming.  Having pasta the night before and having it again probably wasn't such a good idea.  It tastes good at first when it's nice and hot but as it starts to cool and the cheese starts to congeal, it gets boring and overwhelming.  I don't think I'll eat pasta again until another race.  \n\nWe didn't have room for dessert but we did order the hot chocolate.  This is a yummy, rich, and delicious drink with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and orange zest.  It was the perfect drink for a cold day in Vegas."

I love them all but the kobe sliders are always a must have for me.They are so cute and remind me of crabby patties off of Sponge Bob. The crab cake salad is my favorite of them all, the crab cake is really moist and creamy. Another one of my must have appetizer is their ahi tuna tacos, but they're only seasonal. It's raw chunks of tuna with a sweet salsa on mini hard shell tacos. \n\nEvery time I come to Vegas, I have to stop by. The restaurant is super cute and makes me feel like I'm in my dream play house. The service is always great. The only bad thing about Serendipity 3 is the wait to be seated and the prices are a bit pricey, but hey you're in Vegas."

Without the crushed ice, its not really frozen, so it definitely doesn't really quench your thirst. Their portions were also a bit smaller, not that I could have finished mine, it got too sweet towards the middle.  \n\nI came here for nostalgia and I'll never be coming back to this serendipity.

Perhaps I was comparing it too much to the one in New York- intimate, quaint, cute.  This Serendipity definitely has the cute and dainty aesthetics but the service definitely does not live up to what is fabulous on the outside.\n\nSame delicious signature frrroooozen hot chocolate and fun to enjoy on a hot day while people watching from the patio overlooking the Strip.  Food is good, you pay for the presentation more than the taste of it.\n\nWe came on a Sunday around 11 am.  We didn't get seated until 11:35.  Once seated it took 15 minutes for the waiter to take our order.  Then another 30 minutes for our food to make it's way on to our table and into our stomachs.  Too much time wasted just to get a \"quick bite to eat\".  \n\nI think the reason why they have such GINORMOUS menus is so they can occupy your attention  while they take they sweet time getting your order out.  \n\nDesserts are fab but not really worth the wait.  Even if you order from their take out side (which we attempted the next weekend).  A banana split took 20 minutes!!).  They definitely need to work on their service.  And if they want to uphold the essence of the NYC Serendipity, they might want to steer away from playing hip-hop music.

Ok, understandable. It's a Friday night & it's Vegas. I look into the place and half the tables were empty. Umm, ok. The cool thing about the wait is that they send you a text to your phone when your table is ready. Pretty innovative compared to those annoying buzzers that have a limited amount of distance that you can walk away from the place.\n\nAnyhoo, this place is great for late night grubs. Or if you have a sweet tooth like me, it's great for any time of day.  I highly recommend the frozen hot chocolate. Which is actually a glorified chocolate milk with whipped cream. Perfect for taking a break from drinking all those Fat Tuesdays and sandwiches from Earl's."

Then my sister told me its just made from hot cocoa powder, so essentially, its kind of just a milk shake.\n\nIts fun to come here to get some late night dessert if you're craving some sweets! There is a window on the side where you can order Grab 'n' Go if they don't have seats inside. We ordered from the to go window and the girl behind the counter took a blender full of leftover stuff from the last order, simply added stuff to it and made it our order. That's just lazy! It tasted chocolatey, but slushly like because I think there's too much crushed ice. \n\nIts probably a hit or miss here and the night I went was a miss. I'm willing to go back to try the other desserts they have."

I felt like I can go somewhere else and order the same but a better version of it.\n\nOn the other hand, after ordering the Mint Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, I forgot what I had for brunch and just fell in love with the dessert. It was so good that we literally sipped and it was gone in 30 seconds. Lol\n\nI will highly recommend this place just for desserts. I can't wait to go back and try the other desserts on their menu. \n\nMy next goal is to visit the serendipity in New York. Hopefully soon! \n\n#happytummy #serendipity3 #lasvegas"

They were busy! Having waitresses stand on the strip begging people to come in does work. *Keep in mind the theme is pink and orange. Very girly - men don't be scared embrace it as 1/2 of the restaurant was single women grabbing a bite to eat before heading out on a Friday night!* \n\nWe sat at the bar/counter which gave a nice view of the strip and kitchen. After much debate -( the menu is a story in itself) - I had the majas mojito and High Heeled Pump. \n\nThe mojito are made fresh upon order! There is no simple syrup no mixes just pure limes, cranberries, mint and liquor. Delicious - more than 2 could be trouble. \n\nHigh Heeled Pump is the sandwich composed of fresh mozz, tomato, pesto mayo, & basil on a baguette served open faced. DELICIOUS! It also comes with sweet potato fries. \n\nWe were too full to order dessert but they were serving frozen hot chocolate faster than the runners could get it to the table. \n\nI had no idea where I was until I looked at the back of the menu & saw the $1,000 golden sundae.

You walk in to this awesome colorful room filled with a ton of people trying all of Serendipity's creations. After about a 10 minute wait we were escorted to the patio overlooking the strip. Although it was freezing they have fire heaters which helped.\n\nThey handed us this huge menu and gave us the challenge of picking just a few items (when really I wanted to try it all!) I ordered the obvious frozen hot chocolate, thanks to some show on the Food Network or Travel Channel. My husband got a chocolate cake sundae, which could have fed at least two people. We also ordered crab spinach dip which was alright. Just when I thought I had enough the waiter brought out cotton candy martini's for another table. After starring down the martini hoping it would levitate to my table, I ordered one as well. I think the fun of seeing the puffy sugar turn into liquid was more entertaining then drinking it, but maybe mine was made a little strong. \n\nOverall we had an awesome experience. Thanks to Deon, our waiter. He did a great job! I almost didn't want to leave! That was until we saw the check. The place is not cheap! Cant wait for our next trip!"

The first time we went, we had good service that turned bad once our waiter found out we weren't eating, just having the frozen hot chocolate ($15). (We were no longer worth his time.) Then the 2nd time we went in a group, all eating and drinking. Well first of all, one in our group tried to order a Cherry Limeade, and the waitress said \"no, we don't have those\". I suggested to her that perhaps her bartender could make one since it's only soda water, lime juice and cherry syrup. She looked at me like I was nuts, and didn't even offer to ask the bartender. We sat there in awkward silence until the person who tried to order it said, that's ok, I'll have a Cherry Pepsi instead. THEN I noticed that each time any of us got up from our table to walk the LONG journey to the disgusting outdoor/public bathrooms, whenever there was a clogged/crowded walkway through the restaurant, the STAFF would push through first and not let the customer walk through first. It's common courtesy to let others walk through a small space before you, and when you're the staff and a customer is waiting to get through, you should let the customer through first. I found many of the staff to be very rude in this way. They would even drop doors on the faces of their customers when going out to the patio. I have really never seen so many rude staff members in one establishment before. We also waited forever for our food which was served one person/plate at a time, and then waited forever for our waitress to deal with our check. She was also very rude about us splitting the bill on different credit cards. I was really disappointed in this experience because I really love the food there. I'm now not sure I'd go back."

The poached eggs were probably the only thing done right. I also got the Tiffany expresso. It was literally a shot of expresso top with a small dollop of whipped cream and exactly (yes, I counted) seven jimmies. That's it. For 6 dollars.

The outdoor appeal and girly decor drew me in for lunch. \n\nIt was around 4 PM and it was super busy. It took a while for our waitress to finally reach us to take our order. For an appetizer, we ordered the Grilled Globe Artichokes, which was a big mistake. The artichokes we were served were quite small, dry and burnt, and we could barely salvage anything from them. We only got a couple leaves from each piece (three in total) and for $15, it wasn't worth it. We asked if we could order something else. The waitress let us know that the artichoke is suppose to be like that, but will gladly give us something different. We ordered chicken quesadillas. They were very average. Almost microwave quality.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Chop Chop salad, which is basically like a garbage salad (not literally) and I didn't care for it at all. The chicken quality wasn't good and the salad was overall very bland. It reminded me of a cafeteria salad. My friend ordered The Full Monty Chicken Sandwich and she didn't care for hers either. \n\nAt this point we came to the conclusion that this place is probably better known for their sundaes and not their food, as just about every table was enjoying a big sundae. I'm a sucker for Red Velvet Cake, so when I spotted Red Velvet Sundae on the menu, I didn't have to do any other reading. The sundae was huge and contained loads of chocolate ice cream, a slice of red velvet cake and whipped cream and sprinkles. The cake was mediocre and frankly didn't have much flavor. The chocolate ice cream was super good and creamy - almost like a rich, chocolate frozen custard or gelato. The mix of red velvet doesn't go smoothly with chocolate ice cream (yes I know Red Velvet Cake is technically chocolate cake).. it's a bit overpowering to where you can't taste the cake. It'd probably be better with vanilla ice cream. It was good, but not good enough to OD on. \n\nUnfortunately not impressed and probably wouldn't recommend. Also, no restrooms in the restaurant. Thankfully, there is one nearby."

But even this was only okay, which sucks because bacon and french fries is almost like cheating! Overall it was just really ...eggy. \n\nCorned Beef Reuben - Pretty damn good. Thick slices of corned beef. But this isn't supposed to be a jewish deli. Still a good sandwich though.\n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate - Just as good as NY. It was amazing. \n\nCome here for dessert. don't eat here for lunch/dinner unless you want to shell out 12 + bucks for mediocre food. Bring your date here though and watch as the freaking Godzilla-sized sundaes are brought out!"

I do wish they had booths or a more intimate setting but it is just ice cream joint. Hubby and I only go for ice cream after dinner. The food is good there but nothing special. A little over priced but maybe because it's on the strip and it's known from the movie. You can get a burger, reuben sandwich, chili cheese fries, etc.. elsewhere. I thought the \"to-go\" outside ordering area is pretty neat but I never ordered from there. We always dined in. All I'm saying is you can't beat the ice cream/dessert there cause it's so yummy but dinner-wise not worth it. We've learned to share an appetizer and share one ice cream! I personally like the one with the fried oreos!!! nom nom nom!!! We never finish the ice cream anyway. Maybe it's good to share with 3 people to actually finish it all.\n\nI guess everyone has to try the Frozen Hot Chocolate once in their lifetime cause of all the hooplah. I actually enjoy the frozen hot chocolate but others say it's not all that great. I can see where they're coming from on that. HAHA \n\nThey have the 1k or 2k ice cream with gold flakes on the menu.

The full size is easily shared between 3 people, and it's quite satisfying when your sweet tooth is aching (hah pun intended) for something chocolatey and covered in unhealthy amounts of whipped cream. I tried the ice cream here though, and I seriously couldn't finish them because I kind of got over it. I wanted a light sorbet for the hot weather during the summer. Nope, got a super thick mango... thing. I think it was too mango+tons of sugar for my liking. The other flavors taste like a typical grocery ice cream, so nothing too special there either.

We looked across the street and the newly opened Serendipity was calling the names of the ladies in the group; with its bright pink sign and memories of the darling movie which bears the same name. So we sauntered over and were told there was a 20 minute wait. For a Friday night in Vegas, 20 minutes is a blink of an eye. We were called in less than half that time and taken in to be seated. The inside of the restaurant is a little girls dream; pink and blue recessed ceilings, huge colorful light fixtures, and a giant bright pink clock. The menu is fairly extensive for a place that I would have considered more of a dessert spot. The actual food items are MASSIVE. I kid you not, some of the largest items of food I have ever seen given to one person. The sweet potato fries that accompany the entrees are to die for. If you like them even in the slightest, I urge you to give these a shot. They are sprinkled with some sort of cinnamon/sugar/salt combo that is just divine. I ordered the chicken strips (lame I know) because I wasn't feeling all that well and wanted something I could trust. They were actually wonderful and came with three sauces for dipping. My tablemates ordered the worlds largest hot dog California style, a Turkey club that was the size of a VW Bug and a take on a caprese sandwich that weighed as much as a newborn baby. Everything was truly delicious. The drinks from the bar that we ordered (a cranberry mojito) were a little on the weak side, but I think that's what I've come to expect in this fair city. All in all, we had a great meal. The service was great until the waitress dropped a dish down my back. Luckily it was empty and only left crumbs and small food smear. Could have been much worse. I would dine here again for more than one reason, but the biggest one being - we didn't have dessert!! Shameful, trust me, I know. But we were all so stuffed from the massive portions.

The Frozen hot Chocolate in its various incarnations is a staple here which is decent but the hype is a bit extreme over it.  Beware of brainfreeze as you slurp it down!  I go for the Deep Fried Oreos with cookies and creme ice-cream.  Yes, it is a bit over the top, Food porny, crossing the line of decency obscene, but its Vegas right?   Since its on the strip as we all know you are paying out the nose for just about anything.  Also, since its on the strip, the wait can be pretty long as well.  They do have a walk up window that has a limited menu.  I also wish they wouldn't blast the crappy teen pop so loud!  I am sure the wait staff would be happier without it!  Check it out for dessert while on the strip!"

We had the original flavor, oreo, and strawberry. I have to say the original frozen hot chocolate tasted the best!\n\nIt's 10$ for a small cup which is pretty pricy but it was alright for the novlety of it. They have outdoor seating and everything is sherbet  colored so it was a nice place to chill and rest. \n\nI'd say the frozen hot chocolate tastes like a hot chocolate powder milkshake. The oreo flavor tastes more like the creme insides than the cookie and the strawberry tastes kind of like a powdery strawberry milkshake. \n\nBeing a girl, I'm a sucker for cute things. : )"

I'm so happy it wasn't over-hyped. Tasted like ... creamy, slushy Ovaltine. With real whip cream. If I had enough room, I would've wanted another one. \n\nIt's way expensive ($16.50 for a burger!), but it's Vegas. At least the portions are HUGE. The boy ordered the steak sandwich and it was as long as his arm (it was really good, too). I had the uber juicy burger with avocado, brie (my favorite cheese on a burger - you don't see it often as an option), and caramelized onions. The onion rings were crispy and the batter was tasty, but I didn't think it went with the parmesan that was dusted on top. Big con was that the french fries were OVERLY salted. AND because it was sea salt there were huge chunks of salt everywhere. \n\nThe outdoor area is nice, the indoors is fun and flirty, and the fried oreos are ... sin. Try one. And one is pretty much enough."

Thanks to the success of that awful movie of the same name, I remember having to wait hours just to get into the tourist-famous NY original. And so yes, I did get excited upon discovery a Las Vegas location has opened up. I wanted to relive the Frozen Hot Chocolate experience again... yeah I'm lame.\n\nBut this Serendipity is unlike the charming lil shop 'round the corner found in NY. For one, it's made bigger to accommodate the people walking through Caesar's, and it seems the menu has swelled to a myriad of food options. It's also eccentrically...pink throughout. This is what happens when you take a popular dessert shop and go Hollywood - you milk the name and turn it into a more accessible, tourist-friendly location (read: Instant $$ generator).\n\nOf course, while here you have to get their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate, which is really just a iced chilled chocolate smoothie to share.  At $8.50 it's not cheap, but hey you're in Vegas; that's only one less hand of blackjack to play. And man is it good... 108 degree summer weather good. I even came back the next day and got it to-go from their outside take-out window. Sure some may find it overhyped, but I like it so shut up. If you're not impressed, there's a Fat Tuesday around the corner to get wasted...\n\nThe prices for food may be tad high, but the portions are big to go along with it. The foot long NY hotdog is, indeed, a foot long and for $11, it comes with waffle fries and a line of condiments to sprinkle on top. The steak sandwich (~$20) can be shared between 2. It's huge...that's what she said.\n\nSo for pure convenience, Serendipity is a easy destination to check out while you're on the Strip. You won't get the true experience of the original, but who cares? Chances are you'll be too drunk already to care. Plus I hated the movie!"

This time on our 24-trip to Vegas back on 3/4 to 3/5, we decided to finally hit this place up!  \n\nWe came by a little too early, (they opened at 11am, we had gotten up extra early-- so killed some time by walking around Caesar's Palace.)  When we finally got in, we were seated immediately and got a look at the menu.  I love the layout---it's a little bit antique and 1920's vibe.  I loved the caricatures of ladies drinking from huge \"jugs\" of ice cream bowls.  Silly silly silly!  I was hungry and decided to order the chicken pot pie.  It had better  be good considering the size... 10.95 for a pot pie! Wow.  The crust was ample, flakey, and just the right buttery goodness.  The cream sauce, chunks of potato, carrots, and peas were just the right size to spoon up and chew.  The chicken was nice and tender... and thankfully this pot pie didn't feel like I was eating coagulated barf stew. (I'll tell y'all about my pot pie craving and run to Marie Calendar's  another day.)  So the pot pie was delish! \n\nMy friend got the spinach, tomato, and egg omelet topped w/ mozzarella cheese.  It was a huge omelet, and she barely had enough space to finished her criss-cut fries.  Waitress was very helpful and quick.  We definitely did not have space for dessert (even though that was the whole point of going there in the first place!) so we told her we'd  come back later!--- That we did!---\n\nWe came back and took forever to decide over so many different choices.  I forgot the name of the one we got... but it was so chock full of whip cream, vanilla syrup and chocolate syrup... that humongous sundae was enough to feed 3 ppl.  Mind you--- we had to share this treat  between just the two of us!  I'll post up pics soon on this delish treat---  but before we left--- the same waitress from before thanked us for coming back.  A check off my list for trying out this place.  Now I'm gonna go pop the movie in my dvd player and dream up serendipitous chances to find love again. haha."

It's like a chocolate shake basically that's rich and tastes like it has frozen micro ice in it... the flavor is just that \"hot chocolate\"..... The mojito however.. OMG, yum!

I told myself to be ready to be disappointed by all the hype but since I'm such a tourist and have never made it to the Serendipity in NY, I had to go!!! The wait for a table was 30 minutes so we opted for seats at the bar. The bartender who made our frozen hot chocolate was very friendly  which is always a plus. We ordered a frozen hot chocolate, serving size for one, cost about $10. It was huge. Size of my head.. okay not quite because I have a big cabeza but pretty big. I was so excited because it looked scrumptious and. it. was. The whipped cream was silky and didnt taste canned and cheap. The chopped chocolate pieces on top were good quality and just the right amount.. the frozen hot chocolate was brimming over the sides into the plate.. you bet I slurped it up!\n\nI WANT MOREEEEEEE!\n\nA little pricey, too long of a wait for a table but overall I was really happy we went :). My honey even liked it!"

Ever since I saw Rachel Ray visit the NYC location, I've been wanting to try the frozen hot chocolate.\n\nI only wanted a little snack to go with my Frozen Hot Chocolate, but everything was way overpriced...sandwiches $14, app's were $9 and up.  I settled for the potato skins, Spudniks about $9, really?  The frozen Hot Chocolate was around $14.  \n\nThe skins were tasty, but for that price, I could get the same food at TGIF for less.  The Frozen Hot Chocolate was basically a chocolate milkshake. Yes, it was yummy.  Yes, it was huge.  BUT, it really wasn't to die for, thus the high price is not justified.\n\nThe place is decorated cute with the Tiffany style lamps on the tables. The location is good, on the front exterior of Caesar's Palace.  The service was way too sloooooow.  It took forever for our waiter to get our drink order and it took awhile to get our food.  \n\nIt was good to try and I'd probably check out the one in NYC, but I don't think I will be coming back to this location."

I had that super sexy hot chocolate!!! The frozen version of it! I've been wanting to try this place forever.  I went in New York awhile back, but the nearly 3 hour wait caused me to leave.  So, I tried it in Las Vegas! Situated on the strip, in front of Caesar's Palace, it's a great location.  Excellent people watching opportunities.  We had dinner elsewhere, so we only opted for dessert here.  They are pretty pricey, but the servings are massive.  More than enough to share.  We sat at the bar, the server was friendly and poured us glasses of iced water as soon as we sat down.  My husband and I decided to share the frrozen hot chocolate, ($16) and our friend got the banana split.  The server told him that he should probably get the smaller size of the banana split, since the one he opted for was massive.  He was right! When he got the small size, it was still the biggest banana split ever.  Everything was incredibly delicious. \n\nThe only reason I'm docking a star is because our friends wanted coffee, but were told they would need to go inside themselves and order coffee as he can't make it in that area.  So, they went inside and were told by the employee inside that the server should have actually gone in and ordered it for them. Hmm. Also, about halfway through our visit, there was suddenly an odd smell at the outside area.. The place is right on the strip so it could have been coming from there, but regardless..it was kind of gross, and I'm glad we were pretty much done by the time it appeared."

We were hungry and figured the wait would probably be about the same everywhere we go. \n\nWe put our names down and waited about 10mins or so and saw that a group that had came after us taken to sit at the bar! My friend asked how come they got seated before us. The hostess informed us we could jump right in there if we see any avail seats! Well, that would have been nice to know!!! Lucky for us not long after, a couple were leaving so my friend and i hopped on it like flies to poop!\n\nI ordered the Frrrrozen hot chocolate ($10) while my friend ordered the Frrrozen oreo hot chocolate ($14). We planned on eating at a different place after so we decided to share a BLT sandwich w.fries ($16). \n\nIt was nice to sit at the bar as our frozen hot chocolate was made right in front of us. It consisted of cocoa, milk, ice, and i believe sugar was mixed in there also. It gets nicely blended and topped with a ginormous amount of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. My friend's frozen oreo hot chocolate was topped with pieces of oreos and a piece of chocolate egg roll on each side. I guess that's what an extra $4 gets you. \n\nAs soon as i took a sip, I literally jizzed in my pants. Ok, not really. But it was damn good! It was not too sweet - just the perfect amount of sweetness, just perfect. I took a sip of the frozen oreo hot chocolate and it was just as good maybe even a tad bit better! It was a little more on the sweeter side though...so I prefer the original over the oreo.\n\nMoments later, our sandwich comes out and my goodness i was not expecting the BLT to be so huge! - probably a 6 x 6 cut in half...or even bigger! There were thinnly slices of turkey which was stacked to about 3 inches thick (I'm not even kidding), topped with crispy, smoked bacon (sooo good), lettuce, tomatos, the usual...everything tasted so fresh and just soooo good! \n\nI'm so glad we stayed and waited.

The reviews of Serendipity have a common theme, which is that most people say the food is just fair if not lousy, but come for the desserts.  I agree with these people.  They are absolutely right. A couple of weeks ago, while famished and ready for a huge breakfast, my group walked over from The Venetian and got in line with the hordes.  This was a good sign, so I thought.  With all these pleading throngs just begging for their chance at a table, I was thinking this is going to be good.  The feeling intensifed when reading the menu posted outside on the walls, with many items entertainingly described.  Anyway, when we got seated, and the food came, reality set in.  The food was mediocre.  Picture Denny's or an I-Hop on steroids.  Huge omelettes, a French Toast brick that literally was the size of a brick, that sort of thing.  And a problem was that the French Toast brick actually tasted like a brick.  Then there was the foot long steak sandwich that you eat about an inch of, and then you go, \"Done.\"   All this changes with the desserts.  Amazing.  Huge.  Good.  Satisfying.  Fun.   The oxymoronically named \"Frozen Hot Chocolate\" was actually damn good.  So If you are in the area and wandering the strip like the Israelites did in biblical times and you want a \"stuff your face\" fun dessert experience, Serendipity is probably worth a trip."

I guess kids must have lower standards ? Anyway I like  to grade my dinning reviews on a few things. \n\nService; we didn't experience any wait time apparently that's the norm for this time of season so walked starlight in. We we're meet promptly and seated straight away. (Forgot to mention my parents joined us so we were a party of 5).  That was all good but we were seated between the front door the front desk and the kitchen. With plenty of other options I thought this was poor choice. Our server was polite but surly to start with, she warmed up during our stay ( Aussie accent helps sometimes). Kitchen staff were excellent, my son is dairy and gluten free and they went out of there way to make hi something to eat which was great but sadly no one else got this good a food.\n\nFood; being a beef farmer I like to eat steak just about everywhere I go and the steak and fries I ordered arrived in good time but the fries were cold and the steak ordinary. My daughter got the mini cheese burgers which she ate half of one and passed on the rest. I bit into the second one and could see why, the meat was bland and all you could taste was old grease from the grill, yuk.\n\nDad went safe with a sundae and was happy enough but then nothing much phases him when it has whipped cream.\n\nMum just had some fries which also arrived cold and no flavour at all.\n\nSo in summary the food was below expectation and the service average."

Just a late lunch snack consisting of a chicken quesadilla and a frozen hot chocolate for two. The quesadilla was just okay, I've had better at Chevy's. The frozen hot chocolate, however, was delicious. I want to make something clear, though, just so there is no confusion. The infamous frozen hot chocolate from Serendipity is not a hot/cold sundae (which is what I thought it was), but it is the hot chocolate that we all love and know so much in an icy, cold form. Perhaps they should rename it to a hot chocolate slushy?\n\nSerendipity, I will be back!"

Desserts are the main draw here, with plenty of frozen hot chocolate and sundae options available. Portion sizes for desserts and all other food are huge, so sharing is the best option.\n\nDessert was the main reason my son and I stopped by, but we knew we had to eat some real food for dinner before indulging in sweets. The crab cake sandwich ($19) was massive.  A jumbo lump crab cake with a tolerable amount of filler was topped with beefsteak tomatoes, avocado, and an orange aioli. Those savory items with hints of sweetness sat in between an unusually large bun. The only ways to eat it are to smash it down to fit in your mouth or grab a knife and fork and eat it one small piece at a time. An order of the kid's chicken strips ($8.95) come 3 per order with a honey mustard sauce and ranch, along with carrot and celery sticks that my son avoided like the plague. He wasn't crazy about the chicken either. Suffering from a hard breading covering dry meat, he barely finished half his meal. \n\nMoving on to what we both viewed as the \"main course\" we quickly agreed on the red velvet sundae ($14). Substituting chocolate for the vanilla ice cream listed on the menu, the massive dessert served in a goblet had a large chunk of moist and dense cake stuck to one side with hot fudge, whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles topping it all. It was plenty satisfying, but far from refined. The quality doesn't warrant the hefty price tag as it's a dessert that one can replicate at home for far less.\n\n2.5 Stars"

Daughter spoke with the hostess, we had a party of 5 and wanted to sit inside.  The hostess said about an hour wait, then asked if it was my daughters birthday (she was wearing a tiara), the hostess stepped inside for a minute and came back and said don't go far.  We were called for our table about 5 minutes later!  \n\nThe place is cute inside!  The waitress asked my daughters name and they brought her frozen hot chocolate out first with toppings and a candle and the staff announced her birthday and sang to her.  \n\nWe all wanted frozen hot chocolates or milk shakes so we only ordered appetizers.  The frozen hot chocolates are very big and could easily be shared (if we didn't want different flavors).  They were very good but around $11 so beware of that.  We had potato skins, sliders, onion rings and artichoke dip.  The food was all very good.   \n\nI'd go back for the frozen hot chocolate or the appetizers.... maybe both!"

We were a large party, 8 people, and we were celebrating a birthday, the menu looked fantastic and I wanted to try EVERYTHING. I ended up getting a burger, an ABC burger (Avocado, Brie cheese, and Caramelized onions) OMG yummmmyy. I had a choice between steak fries or sweet potato, and though I love me some steak fries, I took the advice of my waitress (who by the way, was AWESOME) and got the sweet potato fries, definitely didn't steer me wrong. The fries portion was HUGE, so I made the rest of the party eat some. They weren't fighting me on that, even with their help I couldn't finish 'em. I would have taken them home, but taking left overs to an airport in a rank taxi isn't the best idea.\nLet me just get this out there, the waitress we had, was AWESOME. She was hilarious, she was personable, and she told us about the restaurant. We even took a picture with her, half of us want to go back just for her.\n\n4 stars for: long wait, small dining room, pretty busy, but nice ambiance (though a full corner was dedicated to merchandise.

Unfortunately, they didn't have the donut that day I came and ate. SAD FACE x 10!!!! No worries, I made due with what was on the menu and got the donut later on in the week.\n\nOkay, moving on from my story to the review of this restaurant. We came in around 11ish on a Tuesday morning to grab some lunch. We were greeted and seated and looking through the menu. I already knew I was going to get a frozen hot chocolate and I decided to try their ABC burger. This was the avocado, brie and caramelized onion burger...(Can you say YUMMMM!!!). I was a huge burger and I had to break the burger up because it was so huge! I was in love with the bun! It was a one of a kind bun with a very soft texture and sweet taste. I never really thought of ever putting brie on my burger but I guess I will now!!! \n\nThe serve was a hit. Our waitress made sure we were taking care of, was uberly nice and made recommendation. I enjoyed having her as my waitress. \n\nYou would think that from the sound of my review they should be receiving 5 stars but what knocked it down was my donut! So I was happy on tuesday but when I came back friday to get a donut (I am not asking for much....just a big giant donut!) I was welcome by an unfriendlier staff members that didn't really seem to want to help me until I was finally helped by the bartender. Everyone kept telling me to go outside the to go bar to get it but...it was 11:10 and they were still not opened....not cool! Luckily the bartender grab me the donut form the back.  \n\nOverall, depending on the day, the service can be either a hit or a miss. The food was pretty good for me to return. If you're a chocolate lover...go try the frozen hot chocolate!"

The plates looked amazing as they went out of the expo window and into the dining room.  But we weren't there for that, we wanted dessert!\n\nDessert - I settled on the Party Like It's Your Birthday Cake and my gosh am I so happy I did.  Everything I wanted combined into a dessert.  Think Neapolitan Ice cream stuffed between multiple layers of fun birthday cake and topped with a wonderful whipped cream icing and topped with dip-n-dots?  It was heaven in my mouth.  The slices of cake are $16 which might sound absurd except for the fact that it's really 3 slices in one and enough for about 4 normal people to share.  \n\nIf you've just hit the jackpot in Vegas, you can also get the $1,000 Golden Opulence Sundae...sadly I was not in that position.  \n\nCons - It would have been a 5 star experience for me if not for the fact that no one seemed to want to help us order and sit where we wanted.  It was a Wednesday night, so not a crazy crowd by there standards and we wanted to sit outside on the patio.  Front patio was closed for the night which was understandable since it was 11:00PM.  They said there was no service on the back patio and to order at the pickup window outside if we wanted to eat there.  Okay.  So we went to the pickup window and were told we can only order cake from inside.  Okay, so we went back in and told the hostess who then said we had to order at the bar for take out.  Fine.  I asked the bar tender if we could have it plated instead of boxed up because I enjoy the experience of the way things look in store as opposed to a plastic container.  She said they couldn't do that if we were sitting outside.  If this was a different establishment in a different city I would knock 2 stars off but it's Vegas and for as many people as they deal with, I respect there are certain rules to follow.    \n\nOn any note, I will definitely go back for their $99 \"Treasure Chest\" dessert that is their version of a \"Kitchen Sink\""

My husband couldn't get enough of the peanut butter frozen hot chocolate, so we were really excited to see this place open for business and much closer to home.\n\nCan you really compare it to the original? Not so much. It lacks the ambiance and character, and the menu is not the same...but neither is the wait time, which scores points with anyone who has waited the standard 2 hours at the original for just a frozen hot chocolate. Cool that they have a take-out window as well.\n\nThe inside dining room is just one big open room, a little crowded and awkward especially since there isn't really a waiting area, so people  were just hovering around by the door. Though we didn't dine on the patio I think this would be more fun, especially since it sits right on The Strip. \n\nThe menu was not the same - seems like they made it more commercial or fast food-ish, but let's be honest, you should be going here for the desserts anyway. We had both the sweet potato fries and the waffle fries, both were good, standard fries. Don't order the nachos - they are awkward to eat and I had to pick off all the unseasoned ground beef that was not appetizing at all. The clam chowder was good though, had a little spice to it. \n\nMy husband claimed the peanut butter frozen hot chocolate wasn't as \"peanut buttery\" as from the original, but he downed it anyway. I couldn't tell the difference. \n\nOverall I would say there are much better dining options in Vegas, but this would be a good place to end the night and splurge on dessert."

You should always try the Original first if you've never had it and then venture out to all the different varieties. So good. I haven't had the hot chocolate here for many years. One friend who didn't want to share, got the peanut butter frozen hot chocolate. I got to try a sip of it and it's pretty good. They have the chunks of peanut butter blended in pretty smoothly but you're still able to decipher the difference between chocolate and peanut butter. Pricey at $11 for a large cup. And I'm not sure but the to-go cup seems a lot smaller than the giant goblet you get if you dine in there. Good for a little sweet splurge every once in a while. There's also a seating area under a tent just beyond the takeout window. There were also heat lamps shining down on us to keep us warm.

The bad news - It was totally watered down. \n\nI was disappointed with the Frozen Hot Chocolate; I was really expecting it to taste like chocolate - rich and luscious. Can you blame me? Unfortunately, it was overly icy and the chocolate flavor was super mellow, watered down with a slight hint of sweetness. The massive amount of whipped cream on top was the sweetest part of the entire drink, but that's not saying much since the ratio of ice overpowered every other flavor we tasted. \n\nThe \"regular\" $13 sized original frozen hot chocolate was shared between my boyfriend and I just fine. For us, it was the right amount. They also had a size \"for two\" $17, but I'm glad we didn't opt for the larger size. It was bland, watery and not memorable. \n\nI would say the best part of the experience  was sipping the same cup as my date, it was really cute and romantic. So if you're not looking to be wow'ed by flavor or quality, I would suggest taking your date here for some cute ol' romance and that's about it - I don't see myself making my way out there for any other reason. \n\nThey also serve appetizers, lunch, dinner, shakes, splits, sundaes, coffee and other desserts which all looked average to me. \n\nPro tip: they sell hello kitty mini beanie babies here for about $10 (and change) each"

My husband said \"put one leg on each side of the entrance door and [expletive deleted]\".  You get the picture.  I personally feel that someone took Barbie, let her drink a shroom shake, smoke a joint, drop acid and gave her some XTC and let her loose in this place.  I personally hate frilly and girly decor, so to each his own.\n\nThe service is fair, but when busy it seems they forget you exist for a few minutes.  When we finally did get our order in and receive our food (burger and fries), I was disappointed.  I expect more from this place, for some reason, and to have mediocre food that isn't even pleasant to my palette, i get depressed.  The food depressed me.  The only happy ending was having a frozen hot chocolate to share before leaving.\n\nI will never step into this pink nightmare again.  Given that people love this place, I personally cannot bring myself to eat their mediocre food and pay hotel restaurant prices for it.  Although the service deserves a 3, the food, alas, deserves nothing more than 2 stars at best.\n\nLet's hope that Serendipity's improves the quality of their food.  I assume that this is the late night place for people to go where they don't really taste anything but will swear up and down that it's the best thing they've ever tried.  Other than that type of justification, I cannot fathom as to why this place is famous other than their dessert and frozen delights.\n\nCome here for the sweets, perhaps, but avoid the menu.  If you do order their food you will leave slightly hunched over and morose at how blah their food is. \n\nDessert: 3.5\nService: maybe a 3\nMenu food: 2 [being nice]"

Considered making reservations but its awfully hard to keep track of time in Vegas. But on the occasions that I do drop by, I've purchased things from the take-out window. Line takes 20 minutes more or less, pray to the desert gods that you're in the shade if it's the summer. I absolutely loved their double frozen hot chocolate, I loved it the first, second, and third time. The flavor and refreshing chills never disappoints. I decided to spice it up and get the green tea frozen hot chocolate, because, you know, we asian and we like our green tea. Boy was I wrong, it was like drinking a watered-down, non-fat, anorexic-slim milk, with matcha powder. It was literally a diet milk. I mean, I still drank it, I'm not going to throw an $11 beverage away. Let me repeat that - $11 for diet milk."

The portions are huge, so if you don't have a fridge in your hotel room, I suggest splitting.\n\nif you have  a Total Rewards card, you get a couple bucks off. Also, you can make reservations via Open Table online. I made a reservation for 2 around 8:30am for breakfast at 10am, and it was a breeze. So you can def do it the same day, even an  hour and half before. No long wait for us."

The pizza is also a fail and the nachos were cold. If you are for some reason still wanting to order food here just go with the chicken tenders, it was about the only edible thing our group ordered. \n\n3) The dessert? Okay its hard to mess up ice cream so I dont get what the hype is about. You can get a large sundae at most Ice Cream places so them putting a brownie with some chocolate and vanilla ice cream together is not life changing. \n\nI guess I just set the bar way too high for this place.

If I remember right theres only 3 locations worldwide and lucky for Las Vegas, one is here. Located on the grounds of Caesar's Palace. A stand alone building that can easily be seen from the street. It sits on the corner of LV Blvd & Flamingo. If you feel like indulging yourself, look up their $1000 sundae(yes 1000, not a typo). For all us mortal folk, they have a regular menu to satisfy our gustatory needs. The location has a very hip & trendy feel, not a very large dining room so the wait can be killer at times, especially for larger groups. If you're fortunate enough to have someone with a Harrah's loyalty card, Total Rewards Diamond or 7star card, your party can get priority seating. If not for that on all my visits I don't think I could have waited 30min plus sometimes just to get seated. I believe they do take reservations but don't quote me on that.\nService has always been good, even when we had problems. One visit, my fries tasted like they were dunked in salt. Our waitress apologized and quickly had a fresh batch brought out.  Their signature frozen hot chocolate is crazy good. A must try at least once if one is a fan of chocolate! The menu has a wide variety of foods from burgers, entrees and a selection of desserts.  Prices are on par with similar eateries on the strip in Vegas(excluding that insane sundae). Some of their items I've tried weren't the greatest and some were good.\nThe one big con I have about this place is that for a spot where I'd think alot of people would go to eat on the strip for late night grub, S3 closes at 10pm, even on the weekends!\nIf you can avoid a long wait to be seated, it's not a bad place to try if you're nearby and don't wanna get TOO gouged on the higher priced places on the strip."

            "review": "[Sorry in advance, my review is a tad long...!]\n\n\n\nWhen I first tried this place back in March, I had a VERY good first impression-- the ambiance, the food, and most of all, the service made me leave this restaurant as one happy customer.\n\nI went at around 5 or 6pm on a Friday night. My two cousins and I were seated the moment we stepped into the place. Our waiter was very friendly and didn't take too long to bring us our drinks and take our order. We ordered the Crab & Artichoke Dip, a High Heel Pump for my cousin and I to share, and a Full Monty for my other cousin.\n\nAlthough it did take a while for them to serve us our orders (about 20-25 min), it was all worth it. Our appetizer and our 2 sandwiches arrived at the same time.\n\nOur order did get a little messed up-- Instead of my cousin and I getting the High Heel Pump, they gave us another Full Monty by mistake. We told the waiter that we received the wrong order. He walked to the cooks and discussed the error with them, came right back to us and said that if we'd like to keep the Full Monty that they made for us, then he would take it out of our tab. :-) DEAL! We said YES with no hesitation. I mean, who WOULDN'T take a free sandwich?!\n\nThe sandwich was flavorful and filling. As I was eating it, I kept telling myself that it was the BEST sandwich I've ever tasted (probably because the thought of it being free made it 10x better). ;-)\n\nThe Crab & Artichoke dip was tasty. It was full of crab meat rather than the actual mayo dip mix, which is a plus. Since we couldn't finish it all, we took the rest of the dip back to our hotel-- I had some for breakfast the morning after (with some bread and crackers we kept in the room), and it still tasted good. Next time I go there, I'll probably order this again, but as my meal instead of an appetizer.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered their infamous Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. Before we ordered it, we asked our waiter if it was okay for us to use a Frrrozen Hot Chocolate coupon that we got from PH. He told us that our coupon wouldn't be valid unless we ordered more than a certain amount, but said that he'll try to work it out for us. At this moment, I was very happy with our waiter and his great service (although I wish I remembered his name)!\n\nThe Frrrozen Hot Chocolate was not too sweet and not too thick. It had a light consistency, which didn't make us too full. I would compare it to a soft, smooth chocolate milkshake. \n\nOnce we received our tab, our Frrrozen Hot Chocolate ended up being FREE! Which meant, 2 free orders in one night! HELL YEAH. Our total was around $35. Rare for me to say this, but our waiter definitely deserved that very generous tip we gave him. :-)"

Good thing we made reservations because there was quite a bunch of people waiting. \n\nOur server was very friendly and nice. He gave great suggestions. \n\nDecor is cute. Makes you feel cheery. \n\nI ordered the Tropical smoothie, which was good. I wanted something refreshing, and it hit the spot. \n\nFor lunch, I ordered the Huevos Rancheros. Delicious. Crispy tortilla layers with black beans, tomatillo sauce, chopped chorizo, cheese and 3 over easy eggs. No clean way to eat it. Just dig in and mix everything around. The flavors are wonderful together. \n\nMy friend got the Cinnamon French Toast, which is GINORMOUS. HUGE, but very good. You're definitely getting your money's worth with that order. The toast is really fluffy and thick, and you might not even need the syrup. It tastes great on its own. \n\nWe, of course, ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate. It was my first time getting it. The only complaint... they brought it out with all of our food, so we didn't try it until after we ate. By that time, it was melted, and just pretty much chocolate milk. Very chocolatey and thick, but I would've preferred it slushed. The whipped cream and chocolate slush would've been delicious together. \n\nI think Serendipity is a great place to go for lunch. Nothing fancy, just good food. :) Go with friends."

Most tables still had leftover dirty dishes from the previous guests....and I got the sense they had been there for quite some time.

It was tasty and fresh. It came in a huge cup big enough to share with 3 people.\n\nI wasn't impressed by their food and they didn't have much of a selection. The food menu was pretty minimal. I ordered the pump sandwich and I didn't like it. The sandwich fell apart on me and the meat tasted weird. Maybe it's all about personal preference when it comes to the food because the quality wasn't bad. Everything here was pretty pricey so this place ain't cheap. Prepare to spend some cash when you come here.\n\nThe dining area is pretty big. I was comfortable where I was sitting. The servers were nice and accommodating.

However, the ice cream sundaes looked so good, I had to reconsider my choice. \n\nI ended up ordering the deep-friend Oreo extravaganza, which included cookies and cream ice cream, whip cream, and that marshmelo sauce. My server wisely advised me to order the marshmello sauce on the side, because it is way to sweet in any sort of normal dose. The deep-friend Oreos were awesome, the seemed to be breaded in corn flakes. Seriously, it put the OC Fair to shame, and that is not easy to do in the deep frying department. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the \"Can't Say No\" sundae, which included humble pie (peanut butter on a graham cracker crust), peanut butter ice cream, coffee ice cream, and a banana. It was freaking awesome, and that humble pie stuff was great. \n\nI must say, the decor was a bit weird. It had sort of an Alice In Wonderland thing going on, including a clock painted on the wall the showed three-o-clock at all times. I suppose that is because this is Serendipity \"3,\" but I am such a stickler about time that it annoyed me. They also had like signs on the wall from old gas stations and stuff. It just didn't match, and it didn't work. Maybe there was a point to it all, but if there was I missed it. \n\nSo, this place is close to five stars (for desert anyway, we didn't order any other food) but not quite there. I would go back though."

I had the lemon chicken but wasn't spectacular.\n\nIf anything, I think this place is a great go-to place for desserts as I am in love with their frozen hot chocolate is what they're famous for.  It is delicious!  \n\nProbably will stop in again for desserts again but not for main course eating."

We started out the the Chicken Nachos, I ordered the One-Eyed Jack and we finished with the Outrageous Banana Split (Coward's Portion). All was awesome. I loved them each. The Nachos were huge and the Sandwich was even bigger and extra tasty the Banana Split was everything you can hope for and the Cowards portion was big enough for my wife and I. Next time I'm in Vegas I will be sure to come back here for more. \n\nMy advice to those who want to try this place is DO NOT GO ON A BUDGET... DON'T CHEAT YOUR SELF TREAT YOUR SELF"

We received a text message within about 10 minutes that the table was ready! Sweet!! \nThe waiter was fast, and friendly. He didn't really do a whole lot of chit chat which I am perfectly okay with! \n\nFOOD: EXCELLENT!! \nI ordered the Ahi Tuna salad. This was so refreshing!! The tuna was superb, and the avocado was just the right texture! I could not finish the salad because the portion was huge which is why I think the 17 dollar price tag was fair and the tuna was so good! \n\nMy husband ordered the ABC burger. It comes with avocado, brie cheese and caramelized onions. I watched him cut it down the middle and the cheese was melted on there just the right way! It looked really delicious and came with sweet potato fries. He really enjoyed his meal.\n\nWe also ordered a frozen hot chocolate of course.. peanut butter cup flavor. It was 11 dollars so high, but worth it! We did not order alcohol. In fact, you really should only order alcohol in a Casino because anywhere else in Vegas you go there is a 500 percent mark up!! But we really are not drinkers and it was way too hot that weekend!! \n\nATMOSPHERE: The decor is super cool in Serendipity 3, and I love the look of the menu! The dishes were pretty neat! You have great views all around you. With the Flamingo right across so you can see the Vegas lights and then on the other side you can see Caesar's Palace and there is a little courtyard area with a bar in the middle. I personally feel like one of the best parts about Vegas is all the people watching. If you sit near the courtyard section of the restaurant you can see a ton of people walking by! \n\nIf you are like us and not necessarily poor but Craft Steakhouse is not an option,  this is a really decent restaurant where you can spend roughly 50 bucks for 2 people."

It's not hard to miss with it's pink and innocent looking exterior. Ambiance wise, it reminds of me an old fashioned ice cream parlor with a tinge of 1920's burlesque. The name and it's looks are very misleading; it's is like a lady in the street, but a freak under the sheets. LOL. \n\nThe wait for an empty restaurant on a Monday afternoon was 30-45 minutes. They did offer immediate bar seating, so I took advantage of that. Sorry star-crossed lover.\n\nTHE FRRROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE\n- \"Original and outrageously divine\" \n- Created around the 1950s\n- For $12, you get one giant whipped cream, chocolate slushie.\n- Oprah said \"I want to dance on the chandeliers!\" as she coined this as one of her favorite items in 2006. \n- First Lady, Jackie Kennedy tried to buy the recipe, and was denied it. \n- About 50 years later, the recipe became available on the internet\n- If you even consider \"6 half-ounce pieces of a variety of YOUR favorite chocolates and 2 teaspoons of STORE BOUGHT hot chocolate mix\" a recipe.\n- You might as well buy the pre-made mix; they sell those too.\n\nOverall, I felt like I was enjoying a Starbucks frappuccino, minus the coffee. I don't think this place was meant for anything else but desserts. Food wasn't the greatest, but the dessert menu did look pretty good. Next time I will definitely try something else... like the Guinness World Record holder as the most expensive dessert, the Golden Opulence Sundae! If someone else pays of course. ;)\n\nGOLDEN OPULENCE SUNDAE\n- For a measly $1000\n- Requires a 48 hour reservation advance so ingredients can be flown in from different parts of the world.\n- Three to five scoops of rich Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream infused with Madagascar vanilla and covered in 23k edible gold leaf. \n- Chocolate syrup from melted Amedei Porcelana, one of the world's most expensive chocolates; and covered with chunks of rare Chuao chocolate, which is from cocoa beans harvested by the Caribbean Sea on Venezuela's coast.\n- Exotic candied fruits from Paris, gold covered almonds/dragets, chocolate truffles and marzipan cherries.\n- Tiny glass bowl of Grand Passion Caviar. It's sweetened and infused with fresh passion fruit, orange and Armagnac.\n- Edible gold leaf is made from pure gold that is compressed or rolled into very thin sheets that are only a few micrometers thick and contain no other metals or impurities.\n- Topped off with a gilded sugar flower and sprinkled with small flakes of more edible gold.\n- All presented in a complimentary Baccarat crystal goblet, and enjoyed with an 18-carat gold spoon."

            "review": "This is probably my 3rd time at Serendipity 3... Not sure why I keep going, maybe it's for the convenience of being around Caesars, PH, and Quad which we often stay at.  The table service is always really slow.  If you want to get seated quickly, you can go to one of the two bars, inside and outside, but you may still have to wait a while either for your server to get to you or for your food to come out.  \n\nWhat I do enjoy about Serendipity 3 is the ambiance outdoors.  While you eat, you get to people watch on the strip; kind of gives that full Vegas experience.\n\nI don't know what is is about me that I always order the $30 steak and egg sandwich.  You can't really go wrong with it, but then again, there has to be other things that are good on the menu.  I almost always never eat the bread; I might as well go somewhere else for steak and eggs.  The menu is really just two full pages, so you are not really left with much selection; that entree seems to be the best sounding one.\n\nWe also ordered the pulled pork on a pretzel bun this time around.  I was a fan of the description, but not a fan of the entree when it finally came out.  Although the bun was decent, the sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking.\n\nFor the steak and egg sandwich and pulled pork on a pretzel bun, the total came out to about $70.  Good thing we didn't order alcohol!  It's Vegas, everything at the hotels or on the strip are overpriced for not that great a value.  I go to Vegas so much; next time, I need to be more of a local."

If only that was the case, I'm sure more restaurants would get a higher rating. With that being said, I like many yelpers absolutely LOVE and came for the frozen hot chocolate. My fiance (att) and I decided to start our strip journey by grabbing food at Serendipity and ordered the small frozen hot chocolate (that is perfect for two people, possibly a third depending on how much you eat) and a flatbread pizza that came with ricotta cheese and meatballs. Boy we're we disappointed with our main dish! There was nothing special or anything that stuck out about the crust of the pizza or the cheese/sauce, but the big disappointment was the meatball and combination of ricotta cheese. We had eaten a combination of pizza like this before at a different restaurant, which is why we choose to go with this pizza, but it could not have been a more bland taste. I believe we only got one meatball on the whole pizza. Granted, the pizza isn't very big (more like an app.), but the meatball was sliced and lacked flavor. If I had eaten the meatball alone, with my eyes closed, I wouldn't have even guessed it was meatball! The ricotta also made the pizza taste even more bland and I think we were given huge dollops of it, because they skimped out on the meatball, but with it lacking taste, I guess it didn't matter. I was very regretful that I didn't order the chicken nachos, once I took a bite of the pizza. \nBut the service was great. Even though it was busy, our waitress was very attentive and made sure our waters were filled up. My fiance HATES to waste food, but this was the first time that he didn't mind leaving the rest of the pizza behind. The price of the pizza definitely did not match up to the taste. \nI'm going to make sure and only order the chicken nachos and a FHC next time I go!"

Serendipity has a takeout booth where you can get many drinks and such to go or a sit-down restaurant where you can get a full menu of food options as well as the frozen hot chocolate in a much nicer presentation.  I opted for the takeout booth.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate is a good portion size and features a frozen chocolate concoction, which is similar to a milkshake though it really is an iced chocolate drink.  The chocolate drink is good.  It is cool and refreshing and has a good chocolate flavor.  I wouldn't say that it is any more memorable than any other good frozen chocolate drink out there, but it is satisfying enough.\n\nThey top the drink off with whipped cream and the whipped cream is good.  It is a little thicker than a lot of whipped creams out there and it has a pretty good vanilla flavor.\n\nService was quick on my one visit.\n\nPrices were high--probably too high (maybe even too high for Las Vegas).  The frozen hot chocolate runs $11.  I think outside of Vegas, a drink like this one would most likely go for $6 and would probably not exceed $8.\n\nSerendipity's frozen hot chocolate is a good but not special drink even though you are definitely paying a special, premium price.  I think it is good for at least one try, but I think the flavor does not really stand out that much.  There is a Vosges boutique in the Forum Shops and that chocolates boutiques used to serve milkshakes--they were far better in terms of flavor and even a little cheaper than Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.\n\nNow that Vosges no longer offers those milkshakes, I'm not sure where you can find a great frozen chocolate drink in Vegas, but a less expensive Haagen-Dazs milkshake would probably provide just as satisfying flavor and experience as what you can have at Serendipity (with the exception of the whipped cream).\n\nSerendipity is located in the outside dining area at the front of Caesars Palace.

The $31 salmon entree that my son ordered was over cooked and covered in a slimy sauce that wasn't described in the menu. The quality of their food should be an embarrassment to Cesar's Palace. To top it off, manager that I spoke to certainly was not embarrassed about her restaurant's food. She was completely insincere in her apology about the low quality food.

We shared the chopped chicken salad (standard, but the hearts of palm were good) and the short rib pot pie (decadent for 11am but still good) ... Of course we had to order the frozen hot chocolate (I had it in NY but JT never tried it). It was refreshing for the 95-degree weather (esp since we hit the pool right after). The portion is ginormous, especially after the other generous-sized items.\n\nService was decent, but it was still quite early for people to be up in Vegas, though it was almost noon. We sat outside and with the shaded area and the open doors with A/C blowing out, it wasn't too hot. There is a $1000 ice cream sundae on the menu that has gold flakes. I've always been intrigued by it, but I don't think I'd ever, ever be able to spend that much on a sundae! Love the giant hot chocolate statues outside too."

I got greedy after looking over the menu and instead of just order ONE frozen hot chocolate, I ordered the CHOCOLATE BLACK OUT CAKE to accompany it to share with two others. \n\n* Frozen Hot Chocolate \nFor the non-chocoholics: don't waste your money on this confection as it will probably taste like any old frozen blended chocolate concoction to you. However, if you dream/breathe in chocolate I highly recommend it as you can taste a slice of specialness at the end of each sip. I don't know if its a hint of nutmeg, a smidge of some unique cocoa, or even just cinnamon - but its pretty delicious! \n\n*Chocolate Black Out Cake\nI ordered this cake under pressure/pure excitement for just being at Serendipity. I was reading the anecdote on the front of how the three came to be and create Serendipity when it mentioned the cake. Seeing that it was spotlighted, I figured that I just HAD to have it. \n\nWARNING: DO NOT COMBINE FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE W/ CHOCOLATE BLACKOUT CAKE, no really, I don't care how much you believe that you love chocolate...because honestly, your insides are going to taste of chocolate for the next 24 hours because of the overdose of chocolate. \n\nNonetheless, this is MY FAVORITE way to eat chocolate cake - SUPER rich and dense, dredged in chocolate ganache and piled high. Sadly, as ambitious and driven as my guests and I were we did not finish the tower of chocolate - one slice would have easily fed a 10 year old's birthday party. \n\nPrice: you get what you pay for - order a few items, but bring a crowd, you'll need the back-up \nAtmosphere: whimsical and fun\nOverall: Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll stop in the first night of the weekend, that way I'll have three days to finish the cake!"

No- they would not seat the 3 of us because \"they did not have enough servers\".  I asked could we just sit in one of the empty tables and wait, we could just wait with a glass of water.  They said \"no, but you can sit at the bar\".  OK- if you have ever seen Serendipity 3, does it make sense to have only 3 servers?  2 people were acting as Hostess.  Perhaps they could have thought, \"Gee, we are understaffed, maybe a Hostess should become immediately a Waitress to cover the restaurant.\" Nope. And so we  crammed into the bar area while a bunch of tables were just left empty.  Nice. Now, let me say, the waitress we eventually had was very nice and the bartender was working hard.  BUT, the restaurant was not full and it took a LONG time to receive our ordered food.  4pm on the Vegas Strip, not 4AM!\n\nThat being said, the food tasted good and the Frozen Hot Chocolate was a home run hit.  \n\nSo park at the Caesar's parking lot, walk all the way through the casino, and good luck if you think you will be easily seated at Serendipity 3 when it is 30% empty."

It wasn't the worse Alfredo I had, but definitely far from the best.

My friend had this, and said it was delicious but yet not worth the money.\n\nWe also had their frozen hot chocolates. I don't why they are famous for it, but it just tasted like any other shake..

            "review": "I could not have been more saddened by how average the famed Frrrozen Hot Chocolate was. And at 14 bucks, it is big, but I'd rather trade in the size for better ingredients! It really does just taste like a chocolaty drink made from Milo and cold milk, blended with ice, topped with reddi-whipp, sprinkled with Hershey's mini chocolate chips, and decorated with 2 straws. Maybe I got the brand names wrong, but the flavor profile is similar to that of supermarket ingredients. Sigh. After my first sip of this loose drink, I started reminiscing Chili's Frosty Chocolate Shake, how thick and creamy and premium tasting that is.... This Frrrozen Hot Chocolate? It's the far opposite of \"decadent\".\n\nMoving on to the food, we shared \"The One & Only Las Vegas Strip Steak Sandwich\", suggested by our server. That was one good recommendation! The sandwich was longer than Subway's footlong, had 3 fried eggs on top and the two of us still couldn't finish it in one siting. The rest tasted just as good the next day, cold (our hotel room did not have a microwave). I never used to think steak would work on bread but this sandwich had me convinced!\n\nI really love the ambience of Serendipity 3. I like how it gives off a \"naughty\" feel, kind of the opposite of what you'd expect from the word \"serendipity\" (that is, when I see that word, I think \"romantic\"). Everything is humongous here, even the menu! I could wrap it around my entire torso, lol. \n\nIf I visit again I'd definitely go against my intuition and the knowledge of what makes them famous and just get something un-intention grabbing, maybe it'll turn out to be the best!"

Ordered the Alfredo pasta which came with 2 slices of garlic focaccia, literally 4 slices of tomato and 3 pieces of boiled broccoli and I think it's $4 more to add chicken (which we did). The pasta tasted ok but it was not worth the price. \n\nWe ordered the double chocolate version of the frozen hot chocolate and it was not as great as I expected but it definitely cooled us down from the obliterating Vegas summer heat! I swear there was at least a 1/3 of a can of whipped cream on top. Who's complaining? *cricket noises*\nWhen the waiter brought our order he mentioned there were 15 types of chocolate in the drink and all I could think was \"whoa, there's 15 types of chocolate in the world?

My wife considered the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate as delicious even after all the chocolate and rich food we indulged in LV.  Since I was craving pizza I ordered the Marguerite Pizza, a thin soft crust with a sweet tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil it was good by not the best I had.  If you are looking for a tart alcoholic drink then I highly recommend the Madras Mojito served  real cranberries and crushed mint leaves.  It was the best Mojito I have had since Fronterra Grill - Chicago.  \n\nSeating hostess was not attentive, however our waitress was so fantastic we tipped extra.  \n\nThis plus was a lot of fun just to hang out on the patio, relax and gaze at Caesars Palace to the left and Las Vegas Blvd to the right."

The waitress was very friendly and very attentive. \n\nWe ordered the hot wings and chicken nachos as appetizers and me and my friend would just half a burger since we saw the burgers they were bringing out and they seemed pretty big. The burger that we got was the portobello burger and we got it with the all white chicken and opted for the fries instead of the coleslaw. \n\nOur food came within a reasonable amount of time. But when I tried the hot wings they tasted sweet with a weird flavor that I can't really explain, but it just was not good at all. We tried the nachos and the setup of putting the nachos in that long oval kind of plate isn't very good as it's hard to get the chips with all the toppings. The nachos were okay....I mean nothing special about them. Then we tried the burger and let me just tell you this.....DONT GET THE BURGERS. The chicken was burnt and the bun was so hard that we had to take the crust off. \n\nOverall the price that you're paying does not match the quality of the food. I think the best part of our meal was probably the fries...pretty disappointed."

(make a C with your fingers) that big, which were DRY.  Very overpriced for crap quality.  Bacon Aioli was good but that was it.\n\nSWEET POTATO FRIES-- $4 Why did people hype this up so hard? They're not crispy, the quantity is that of a kid's meal fries.  These were so whatever\n\nCRAB ARTICHOKE DIP $13-- This was ok.. has big chunks of crab swimming in a sea of CREAM.

I mean I'll admit it's interesting I suppose but all you need to do really is make hot chocolate and blend in it with some ice & there u have it. Also, load up on the whipped cream.  \n\nAll in all, I wish I took the advice of fellow Yelpers who rated this place 1 or 2.  It's VERY overpriced, very disappointing & the food SUCKED.  Service was good and that was about it. Also, they got rid of the fish tank that was seen on that aquarium show.  Another fat disappointment."

We were four people sitting outside while we waited for about 20-25 mins. Not bad..that's what we were told how long in the beginning. We were texted that our table was ready so went inside. We were taken in by the hostess all the way around the restaurant and back outside....just so she can seat us right behind the table we were sitting on while waiting! Thought that was kinda funny but whatever. Waiter came and took our orders....and so it began...\n\nFood took about 30-40 mins to come out. I got the shrimp pesto pasta. It was kinda bland so I generously poured salt and pepper all over it. My 2 friends got the pizza (I forgot what kind) and my bf got the steak standwich. I didnt try the pizza but it seemed mediocre from my friends' reaction. The steak sandwich was pretty good except my bf ordered medium well but the steak was red. He still ate it bec he likes rare also. Before this, I forgot to mention the waiter forgot to give us napkins and utensils. My friend had to go up to him to get his attention so we can ask for some. We also asked for parmesan cheese and red pepper for the pizza and we never got them. After a while you just get tired of waiting for the server or asking for things you will never get. They (2 different servers) also refilled our glasses with the wrong drinks. They tell you what they were gonna pour but before you can even say no, they've already poured the wrong thing or they tell you the right drink, but the wrong drink comes out of the pitcher. I didnt know whether to laugh or get mad. We were just bewildered by this catastrophic lunch. Customer next to us who was there before us didnt get her order until we were already done eating! As soon as her food came out, she also stormed right out just to prove a point. The main server said the kitchen is backed up. I wanted to tell him that I've been to plenty of really busy restaurants but their service remains excellent. Here, everything just seemed to have all gone wrong!\n\nThe 1 star is for the frozen hot chocolate...that will be the only thing I will ever order from here (if I ever come back) and will order it to-go."

It came with black beans,  crusty old looking ground beef that must have been sitting somewhere for hours and cheese. The small amount of meat on the nachos had that dark crusted over color on the top and we should have known from that point on but they were $14 so we ate about 1/3 of the order. We both ordered the up the skirt steak, it was pretty good but again we both ended up with food poisoning -though I can't say if it was the steak or the nachos that got us. I tried the green tea frozen drink and it was way too sweet for me but they were kind and switched it out for me.  Our server was nice, he was really busy so another guy (mgr?) took our order for us and brought us water which was nice. I don't know, our bill was about $90 with tax and tip for 2 entree's, 1 appetizer and 2 hot chocolates and that was with their TR's discount. I would only come back for the frozen hot chocolate, after the night my bf and I spent in the restroom we will stay far away from the food. I will say that last year we had the white pineapple sangria and it was the best I've had, so I guess I only like their beverages.\n\n**update - ok after looking at the pictures of other peoples nachos ours looked nothing like that, I am convinced it was the nachos that got us sick.

They were good, nice and crispy on the outside, moist warm white meat chicken on the inside. The dipping sauces were good too, I liked the Honey Mustard best, my husband liked the BBQ sauce. My husband got the Cheeseburger with Brie Cheese and Fries, it was an okay burger, not a lot of flavor, but it was cooked correctly.

When she asked me whether I wanted indoor or outdoor seats, I said \"whichever is available at the time\" (okay, maybe that was a dumb response) and proceeded to give me a short lecture about how when making reservations you need to give an exact response just like giving an exact time. Okay, I understand I might've sounded dumb, but don't talk to your customers as if they're kids or something. It didn't really seem like she wanted to help me after that. \n\nWhen we came back around 2, I was a bit iffy and worried my parents wouldn't enjoy the restaurant since it's very whimsical and young and hip, especially since the hostess gave me sort of a negative vibe. However, after getting past the hostesses, our waiter made me feel a lot better about choosing to eat there. I was in doubt, but he was funny, honest, and helpful about the menu. \n\nOverall, the restaurant is unique, the Frozen Hot Chocolate is a thumbs up (we even ordered the Green Tea after trying their original), and it's definitely a good place to try out. The hostesses just sucked this day."

Quite funky & wacky, but not in an uncomfortably weird way...more like up-beat & humorous. Their food does little to disappoint.... their macaroni & cheese for instance is full of cheddar gooey awesomeness, can't fail with a burger, my friends said their grilled cheese is one of a kind. I didn't bother trying their frozen hot chocolate b/c I've heard its overrated, but to be honest, we were so stuffed from all the delicious appetizers and main courses that we didn't have room for dessert. I regret not trying their fried oreo sundae (which is hidden from the menu), but definitely won't miss it next time I'm in Sin City."

Quiet in a good way with cheesy 80's music playing overhead and as much kitsch and scripted-happy service as I'd expected it would be mere seconds after I was seated that coffee was filled and with both my friend and I favorite sweets to savories our decision was simple - both items arriving after numerous coffee refills in all their gluttonous glory.  Understanding that Serendipity is more about fun than fine dining it was really no surprise that the bottom slice of French Toast was somewhat dry due to a lack of whipped cream saturation and although decent certainly nothing I'd order again and yet what was surprising was the high quality of the Waffles - both golden and crunchy on the exterior with a soft, pliable inside and nicely balanced between sweet and savory by the balsamic strawberries and chocolate.  Satisfied but unwilling to leave Serendipity without sampling one of their signature sundaes the meal was capped with the carrot cake version, a substantial chunk of dense cake complete with cream cheese icing buried in ice cream, walnuts, fudge, and whipped cream that really had no chance of failing in the flavor department if you enjoy sweets, though perhaps a touch less 'subtle' than some like their breakfasts...or lunches...or dinners."

It definitely is not like a frosty or a milk shake, but something in between. It was topped with whip cream and served with two straws for my Mom and I to share.\n\nThe only reason I could not give five stars to this Serendipity is the fact that it took us 45 minutes to get our drink. The wait was so long and there was relatively a short line. There was only one man working the register and one man making the dishes.  The wait inside was one hour at 11:00 PM.

And I had fond memories of that delicious dessert that I drank up all by myself that rainy and cold day on the East Coast.\n\nWith the recent opening of Serendipity 3 on Las Vegas Boulevard, I had a whole new setting to experience this lovely and decadent drink.  \n\nHeading there for lunch on a weekday, we chose to sit outside despite the breeze.  Our friendly and spirited waiter was patient with us as we took forever to order.\n\nLorna D. started off her beverage choice with their Mochaccino \"Our Own Brew of Rich Chocolate and Aromatic Espresso with a Topsy Turvey Whipped Cream Peak\" *$5).  It was a yummy drink that tasted more chocolaty than espresso-like.\n\nFor lunch, our friend chose the Breakfast Steak Sandwich \"NY Steak, Sunny Side Up Eggs, Smoked Pepper Bacon, Cheddar and Jack Cheeses\" ($20) with Sweet Potato Fries.  Now, it does seem quite pricey, but these orders are really meant to be split.  Three large eggs laid their sunny eyes up as bacon spilled out from the sides.  \n\nLorna D. was craving more of a breakfast item and had the Central Park \"Casper, with Spinach, Avocado and Swiss Cheese\" ($14) with Coleslaw.  It's a six egg white omelet folded gently with avocado slices on top.  It was definitely more than enough food and she liked the coleslaw too.\n\nI went for the High Heel Pump \"Prosciutto, Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil Pesto and Balsamic Glaze\" ($16) with Sweet Potato Fries.  Looking absolutely gorgeous as an open-faced sandwich, it yearned to be shared.  The flavors of the prosciutto, mozzarella, tomato, pesto, and glaze worked so perfectly together.  I couldn't wait to bring some home for the Husband to taste!  (And it tasted very good later as leftovers, we even toasted it when we got home. Yum!)  The sweet potato fries were really good too, the perfect amount of sweetness and a sprinkling of salt leaves you without the need for a dipping sauce of any kind.  \n\nOf course we couldn't go without having their Frrrozen Hot Chocolate ($9.75)!  Yum! So decadent, so delicious and still as good as I remembered!  Perfect for a party of two or three to share!\n\nService was still friendly by the end, but business had picked up so it took a bit longer to get to go boxes and things like that.\n\nOverall, Serendipity 3 does things right.  Don't be turned off by the high prices, just plan on sharing everything!  It's the perfect ending to a date!"

Serendipity 3 (LV) has all the glitz and glamor you would expect from a Vegas restaurant/establishment on the strip. It's busy enough during the evenings, but nothing to be concerned with you will get seated quickly.\n\nOrdered the Peanut Butter Frrrozen Hot Chocolate and their Chicken Not So Little (chicken tenders). Really enjoyed the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. The CNSL were nice too, but I get the feeling it's pre-fried, pre-packed, pre-frozen, and then re-heated upon order. Of course there was no advertisement saying that they make it from scratch, but that goes for several other restaurants, that sell chicken tenders for less.\n\nAt any rate, the key item that brought me to this place was the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate and it is good. Worth stopping by to purchase and eat/drink, especially on a hot summer day. The other item that brings me to this place is the Golden Opulence Sundae. Don't get me wrong, I did not buy it. It just draws my attention. Makes me wonder what would get me to dish out $1,000 for it."

Every time that I have been here they always tell me it's about a 30 minute wait but most of the time it only takes about half. I have sat indoors and outdoors. I prefer sitting outdoors on a nice day/night since the patio faces Las Vegas Blvd. It can get loud when dining indoors. The service is great and I never have problems with my order.\n\nWe usually get the Double Frozen Hot Chocolate for two. I am a chocolate lover so I enjoy this dessert even as simple as it is. I've tried the White Chocolate Frozen Hot Chocolate but I prefer the regular chocolate. \n\nOverall, it's a good place to dine and experience the Frozen Hot Chocolate. So give this place a go if you're on the strip and want an icy chocolate dessert."

I had no idea they even served breakfast since I'd only heard of their famous desserts (i.e. their frozen hot chocolate).\n\nAfter eating at Serendipity, I feel like it's definitely one of those places that should specialize and serve only one type of food (basically they should stick to desserts). It's not that their food was bad - I thoroughly enjoyed my omelette - I just thought they were trying to cater to everyone when they should just have desserts. I'm sure that if I had dessert that my rating would be higher but for right now, 3 STARS. They did have a bunch of breakfast/brunch options but they were a little pricey.\n\nService was easily 5 STARS - our server was kind, knowledgeable about the menu, and very attentive.\n\nI think if you're scrambling to find a breakfast spot, Serendipity is an okay choice but otherwise just stick to desserts here."

The girl behind me got fed up and started yelling at her to come back, which ended up benefiting me, she came back and told me whatever I would order would take at least 30 minutes and all I wanted was a frozen drink, I ordered and she said it would take less than 5 minutes. What a joke. It took 15, I felt bad that my bf was sitting at a table waiting for me and the super sweet dumb drink I had my heart set on. I really should have gotten one of those tall flavored margaritas. I felt bad for all those other people waiting in a much longer line than I had.

First and foremost, the establishment smelled like feet and vomit when we walked in. The aroma was so strong distinguishable between melted cheese and burnt olive oil. Secondly, the frrrrozen hot chocolate was melted to the core like a milkshake and it surely did not taste like hot chocolate. In fact, it tasted like a Wendy's Frosty. Boo...sure wasn't anything special about it. Third, the fried oreos my daughter had also wasn't anything special. It was coated with, what looked like, \"Frosted Flakes\". Are they for real? Again, boo...nothing special. Lastly and most embarrassing for this establishment, we ordered a $15 chocolate cake to go. When the cake came out, it was in a cheap 02cents plastic bag with the words \"Thank you\"! Now they have got to be pranking customers with this crap. For real now? A $15 chocolate cake and they cannot afford a nice, pink, decorative paper bag with rope handles?? Woooow...talk about cheap in business. Overall, this establishment is a shame. There was no wow factor in our visit. We will never return here that's for sure. Albertson's serves better chocolate cake and Wendy's definitely has better frozen hot chocolate. Visitors: stay away if you don't want to be disappointed."

I wondered that when I was told I should order a Frozen Hot Chocolate here at Serendipity 3. And so after a big dinner outside the Strip, my dad and I decided to save dessert and satisfy my curiosity.\n\nAfter managing to cut through hoards of tourists to even get here, we were immediately faced with yet another crowd, this time all in line just to get in. I didn't realize Serendipity was also a restaurant, and not surprisingly, being located right on the Strip, on a Friday night there were 10 parties ahead of us (which I found out through their handy website and text-notification system). What I didn't figure out right away was that there was also a to-go window, so that's where we went ahead and got our drinks.\n\nMy dad got the Strawberry, and I went ahead with my friend's recommendation. OMG; That's some rich chocolate.\n\nI got what seemed to be about 16 ounces of chocolatey goodness. I loved every sip, but the flavor was so dense I had to take a break after each one. I can see how this drink can leave an impression on people, but I do believe there's a catch. After my dad tried a sip of mine, he made a good point. The Frozen Hot Chocolate was much like pure chocolate syrup. Maybe ice was blended in with the syrup, but that's what it essentially was. But as a chocoholic, why wouldn't I enjoy that?\n\nWell, a quick and easy reason is the price. For two of those suckers, I think the bill came out to about $20. A more foodie rationale might also argue the signature drink's lack of subtlety. It's like feeding people who love ketchup an even denser ketchup, with nothing else to enjoy it with. What might be fun is if they gave you biscuit sticks to dip into it, or if they floated, layered, or marbled vanilla ice-cream with the already concentrated concoction. Something along those lines to break it up a little.\n\nThat's my take on the Frozen Hot Chocolate. As far as the Strawberry version goes, my dad thought it tasted like an overpriced McDonald's Strawberry Milkshake. I concur."

Worth experiencing once, though! \n\nThe star of the show for me was the mac and cheese, which was decadent and perfectly seasoned. He went with a turkey club sandwich which was surprisingly tasty and gigantic (the portion sizes make the pricing pretty reasonable for the strip, in my opinion) and so between the two of us we had a really satisfying meal. I had to resist nabbing most of his fries. \n\nThen, the waitress brought us our to go cake and I nearly fell out of my chair. It was a HUGE slab of cake, with lots of thin layers and plenty of cream cheese frosting. I was still chipping away at it three days later and I'm a big eater. In the end, I didn't even finish the whole thing. If I was to do it again, I'd go with the sundae version, mixing cake and vanilla ice cream and eat it there. \n\nMy only real disappointment was in the decor, I expected it to be cuter inside, but it appeared they were doing a remodel and also, I'm pretty snobby about that sort of thing. I also wasn't too keen on the scratched, cloudy looking plastic water glasses, but again, I'm pretty picky about details.\nAll in all, it was a fun afternoon outing and I enjoyed it."

Maybe it's because they have something called Frozen Hot Chocolate, or maybe it's because of the movie with John Cusak... (love John Cusak) But, I doubt highly I will be coming back here. \nWe came here for a late dinner after a show. We walked from The Venetian and though it didn't seem like the restaurant inside was crowded, we waited about 20 minutes for our table. It's a large menu with their versions of basic food items. I ordered the chicken burger with the blue cheese and BBQ sauce, but asked to hold the BBQ sauce. To me, blue cheese and BBQ sauce don't go together. I got that with the regular fries. We also got the Turkey Club and sweet potato fries, a side mixed salad, root beer float and a Frozen Hot Chocolate. We got our drinks and proceeded to wait. and wait. I guess I shouldn't have assumed that the Frozen Hot Chocolates were more like dessert, especially when I had ordered a root beer float. But I was wrong because the waiter brought out our Frozen Hot Chocolates before our food. He was nice to split it for us, but I just wasn't ready for it and really... it tasted like soupy chocolate ice cream. Ended up that we took a couple sips and it went to waste because we were waiting for the food. The club sandwich ended up being like any other sandwich. Cold cuts from the grocery store and bacon. No mustard. Nothing original about it. The chicken sandwich had a nice big piece of chicken, but, it had the BBBQ sauce on it. When I told the waiter, he said, \"I asked them not to put the BBQ sauce on.\" He asked if I wanted a new one. It's a nice offer, but I've waited this long.. I'm going to have to wait longer? So, I asked, \"Is it going to take long?\" He tapped me on the shoulder and said, \"Of course, it's chicken\" Uh huh. So, if I asked for a cold lunch meat sandwich redo, it wouldn't have taken as long? And, by the way, the cold cuts were cold. But, he ended up taking the chicken sandwich off the bill. Even with that, I was disappointed. Food is way overpriced and not that good. Lesson learned."

I must confess I first heard of it on Oprah (their Frozen Hot Chocolate is her fav). \n\nThe building was very easy to find since it was hot pink in front of Ceaser's Palace. My friends and I sat at the bar because it was packed for lunch. The bartender was very friendly and recommended a Strawberries and Cream Mojito. So naturally, I had to try it. Yes it was expensive ($14 I think), but it was very big and absolutely yummy! We ordered a cheese pizza and finished it off with a Frozen Hot Chocolate for 2 (we shared it with FOUR people and still couldn't finish it!) \n\nOh if you order a salad...make sure to SHARE it, they're HUGE!\n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant.

She even confronted the lady who was supposed to be our waitress and turned out no one wanted to tend my table.

Never had frozen hot chocolate nor been to Serendipity for that matter, so it was a must try when I went to Vega$$$. We already ate some Secret Pizza for dinner beforehand, so I wasn't all that hungry. My other two friends had some kind of sandwich (it was HUGE btw) with sunny side up eggs, bacon and some sort of meat in between. They said it had no taste and wasn't good which was surprising to me 'cause I love sunny side up eggs and bacon hahah. We sat at the bar and for some reason our waiter gave us a complimentary order of onion rings. He never really stated why. I assume, extra/wrong order? But whatevz, it was sooo bomb. Super crispy and flavorful. \n\nAs for the frozen hot chocolate, it was mediocre and kinda tasted like a chocolate shake but not as thick. but it was way too big for me to finish on my own, so I had to share amongst my friends. Don't think I LOVE(d) it, but it was good. But if we had waited an hour for that, I don't think it'd be worth it. Unless I'm actually sitting down to eat as well. The food seems decent. But there's also mixed reviews on them. The vodka ravioli looks yummy. Wonder if that's any good...and the other desserts sounded so yummy as well. Will def come back to try if the wait isn't long. Or else I'll just hit up the take-out window. \n\nThe place is cutesy and the food seems to come in big portions but I'll def have to come back in order to like it more. All the hype kinda killed it for me, imo.\n\n3/5. Next time around I hope to bump it up to a 4 :o)"

My boyfriend and I walked in from the street side, the patio area facing Flamingo, not too sure where the front is. There where no signs and we both obviously looked a little lost, as we walked and stopped to look for a host a couple times. On our way to finally finding the front entrance, we passed by at least two servers that just stared at us. I wouldn't go as far as saying that they glared, but they definitely didn't look friendly or offer their assistance. When we were greeted by the host, we were told that there would be a 15-20 minute wait for the patio, which is fine since we had time, but I just find it confusing because only a third of the tables in the patio area was even occupied. Also, we weren't told that there was an option to place Togo orders at their window out front with open seating. When we finally got seated, our server didn't come by until 10 minutes later and he didn't even ask us for our drink order first. He just assumed we were ready to order. He brought out our frozen hot chocolate even before getting our water, which in total was about 20 minutes before we were offered a drink. Very disappointed with the service, but if you have a total rewards card, you do get a discount, so there's a plus for you. \n\nNow onto the long anticipated frozen hot chocolate. I've seen so many amazing photos and read a ton of great reviews about this staple of theirs, but honestly, it was just okay. It's literally what the name is - chilled hot chocolate. It's not that special and really was just alright. Don't get me wrong, I'm a chocolate lover, but this really didn't do much for me. \n\nI'm glad I finally got to experience this, but like I said, just a one time thing for me."

But give me some sweets, ice cream and coffee and I'll jump in joy and throw a party! Well that's how if felt when I dined at Serendipity3- I wanted to order all the dessert options on the menu. \n\nThe Mochaccino is fabulous. Rich hot chocolate with espresso- genius! I wouldn't had wanted to start my sleepless morning any other way. \n\nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate is scrumptious. I had to control myself in preventing a brain freeze but I couldn't help it. It was oozing and spilling. Haah. \n\nThe Audrey Sundae- MmmmMmmm. Humble Pie, Vanilla Ice Cream, Coffee Ice Cream, Bananas, Hot Fudge and topped with Whipped Cream, Peanuts and a cherry. If you like coffee ice cream ask for it to be scooped and layered on top of the vanilla or else you're going to have to dig to the bottom of the cup for it. If your giving, definitely share this sundae. But I wouldn't blame you if you rather have it all to yourself ;)\n\nThe ABC Burger is hefty. The meat patty is cooked to your liking- ours was nice and juicy. With avocados, grilled onions and tomatoes with a slice of pickle on the side. Topping it off with sweet potatoes fries just screams perfect match. \n\nThe foot long hot dog absolutely calls out food coma. But who can resist a FOOT long hot dog topped with chili, onions, cheddar cheese and a side of steak fries. \n\nThe breakfast options is also a great start to one's day: x-large sausages, fluffy pancakes and eggs scrambled nicely. \n\nService is alright. The place is so busy, not much attention is given. There are several seating options- inside, outside patio by the entrance for Caesars Palace or outside next to The Strip. Oh, this place is decorated with lots of pink. But your surrounds will be the last of your worries because you will be so concentrated on your food! \n\nThe stretch to my pants is all well worth it!

Other dishes my family ordered were the Corned Beef Hash & Eggs, Mushroom Quiche, Eastside Western Omelet, and Breakfast Burger. Even though I love prosciutto, I wasn't a fan of the Eastside Western Omelet. The best dish I tried was probably the Mushroom Quiche. It was tasty with a buttery crust, and the salad was fresh.\n\nWe ordered one Frozen Hot Chocolate to share. It was my first time trying this after hearing about it for so many years, and I don't think it lived up to the hype. It was sweet and tasty, and definitely a perfect treat for the summer. However, I don't see it being worth $11. Luckily, we had a coupon for a free Frozen Hot Chocolate with the purchase of an entree.\n\nService was pretty good. Our waitress was busy, but still very friendly and refilled our coffees and waters promptly\n\nOverall, the food was decent, with some good dishes and some subpar ones.

The waiter was very professional, knew the menu, & never had my water glass empty (I always base my service on restaurants on how well they keep my water full). My girlfriend ordered Fried eggs Benedict & size-zero cocktail drink & she loved it- I got to try the Benedict & it was awesome! I had the all famous steak & eggs sandwich & that was so good! It looked so good that I didn't want to bite into it! It is a New York steak (I ordered it rare) w/bacon & 3 sunny side up eggs all on top of garlic bread. Super good! I would definitely come back here for this! Then, to top off our meals we ordered the frozen hot chocolate- this is a must if you go here!"

We didn't need a reservation and we didn't have to wait because it is less busy on Mondays.\n\nWe looked at the menu and was surprised on how expensive everything was. Nothing was very appetizing from what I read in the descriptions of the food items. I was craving some tomato soup so I got one. My boyfriend ordered the frozen hot chocolate and burger combo.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate was good.  If you love whipped cream and chocolate Frappuccinos then I'm sure you'd enjoy this.\n\nThe creamy tomato soup was okay. It tasted more like pasta/marinara sauce. It was not creamy at all. \n\nThe ABC burger was horrible.  The bun was burnt and so was the burger. I could not eat this. I like a little charbroiled flavor but this was too much. I looked at the burger and the bottom was all black! I don't like complaining about the food so I didnt. But that burger needed to go straight to the trash.  Definitely not worth almost 20 bucks.  Plus none of the toppings were mind blowing. \n\nThe service was good. I found it so interesting that the Togo area next door is so much cheaper than the restaurant. Maybe next time I'll just try that. \n\nI wouldn't go back here."

I was worried about it since we had been waiting in the initial line for so long, but we were soon called up in about 5 minutes. We were seated and then searched the menu with a fine toothed comb. We decided to split a foot long hot dog and a red velvet sundae. The hot dog was great. It was very  large and juicy to boot! The sundae was amazing! She doesn't like ice cream so much and I was happy to eat it for the both of us. She did get some bites in though and enjoyed it as well. The fudge was so great and the entire meal was really good. \n\nThe only con I can think of is that it is completely over priced. The portions are large and the food is good, however, I can't fully justify every just dropping in to this place.

Another must try dessert is the deep fried oreo sundae. The oreos are fried in a pancakey batter and dropped in the chocolate sundae IT IS SUHHWEET but me likey! Food, as expected was not the best. My cousin go the chicken and waffles; waffles were a bit soggy and the chicken lacked salt. Other than that the chicken's consistency was pretty crunchy. We all had a margherita pizza to share which was also ehhh. If you plan on coming here make sure you put your name down and wait it out as you shop at the Forum. They don't take reservations and everyone and their mama's are waiting to try Serendipity. Service is slow considering the crowds, so I'd cut em some slack.

I've tried their cheeseburger which I thought needed ketchup, and their fries could use a little less salt.  The artichoke was good, but it's just grilled, I don't know how wrong you could go with that.  I've also had the onion rings on another occasion...once again okay.  \n\nNow let's get to the desserts, so their frozen hot chocolate, it was good, but nothing that I think to myself as something I need to have.  My boyfriend had one of their sundaes and it was huge.  Well most of their portions are huge so thing about sharing, or possibly taking some of it home.  So maybe that makes their price point more reasonable.  \n\nA tip before you go, bring your Total Rewards Card, as you will have a cheaper version of the menu, and it's free to sign up for. ;)"

I walked straight to the bar area (there are 2, one outside and one inside, I went to the one inside) waited for a good minute or two to finally head over to the hostess section, I asked where can I order takeout. She said to order at the bar.. i headed back to the bar said i wanted to do take out and ordered my drink..\n\nThe bartender then takes my order and tells me to wait near the hostess section and he'll drop it off there. *note no one was at the bar when I came. 2 minutes later a hand full of people packed up the bar and my drink was no longer made. waited another 5 minutes and the bartender is delivering food and drinks to people sitting at the bar where as I was just waiting.. Finally I went over and said to cancel my order.. He didn't ask me why or even try to change my mind. He went ahead and called the manager to cancel it for him... the manager ALSO DIDNT try to talk to me or ask me whats wrong.\n\nSTRAIGHT TO THE POINT: This establishment is poorly run.(period) customer service is out of the question when you're in Vegas. You lose one customer, but you gain 10 the next minute. I hope the NY location isn't like this place at all. I was in disbelief when the manager just came out of her office, swiped her card a few times ( I think she's new, she couldn't cancel my order, at least i think thats what she's doing... she swiped her card so many times i was just amazed.) and left without saying a hello, why do you want to cancel your order? i'm sorry, have a good night\"...

I have attempted to go to the one in New York before but since the wait was so long, I failed to try it out!  So the next best thing was to go to the one right across from Caesar's Palace!  At first, I was a bit disappointed by its decor since the one in New York looked way better.. It wasn't the 30 min wait for me since the inside venue was just average to me.  So I went to the take-out window where there was also a line!  The line wasn't as bad but what was bad was the slow service... it was extremely slow.. the worker apologized everyone for the wait since he was the only one working there with a cook in the back.. It just bugged me since the only thing I ordered was the Frozen Hot Chocolate dessert and I had to wait a good time for it...... Also, it looked to me like he was literally taking his time even though there was a line outside... oyeee that bugs me!!\n\nIronic .. Frozen hot chocolate.. I am usually not a big fan of chocolatey things since I am scared they overdo it on the sweetness and chocolate thickness.. But I may say it was pretty good!  Good mixture of ice and chocolate which made it extremely refreshing in the hot humid vegas weather!  My friend and I enjoyed it in the many tables and seats they had in the outdoor patio, which was nice!  But of course, the alternative was to run inside Caesar's for some nice air conditioning!\n\nI honestly wasn't wowed by this place.. It definitely did not live up to the hype that the New York Serendipity has!  But if you want desserts and somewhere to stop by along your long walks down the strip, do check this place out!"

To be honest, I've never actually had the food here -- always come here for dessert. \n\nLet's start by saying that the Frozen Hot Chocolate is magical.\n\nThe first time I had a Serendipity Frozen Hot Chocolate was in New York City. I remember it clearly the first time I had one -- the wait to be seated, the shock that there is a minimum charge per person, and the GIANT Frozen Hot Chocolates coming out and instantly regretting not having ordered 1 to share between 2 people. Most importantly, I remember how delicious it was. Imagine an amazing hot chocolate but frozen and then melted down to the perfect temperature so it's like have a smoothie. That's what the Frozen Hot Chocolate is like.\n\nOn a hot summer day or even a cool winter night, it'll satiate all of your chocolate desires -- even the hot cocoa ones.\n\nI also have tried some of their other drinks, including the Amaretto Almond Hot Chocolate. I'm going to be honest and just say that I think the classic, Frozen Hot Chocolate is still their best. Definitely their star dish in my opinion. \n\nIf you've never been to one of the famous Serendipity restaurants, I'd recommend stopping by for the Frozen Hot Chocolate. You can grab one from the bar window outside if you don't want to sit inside."

The To Go menu has a lot less attractive items on the menu.  The wait was still very long for bf & I to get our kobe sliders & fries.  And Janice C. who was behind us her salad came after the order of the guy behind her!  Who puts one cook in such a popular To Go window of the restaurant?!  \n\nThe kobe sliders weren't bad, but $9 for 3 of them...geeze...happy hour somewhere else would have been cheaper!  The fries were alright too, wish they were a little crispier however.  I had a sip of my friend's frozen hot chocolate, it was alright, nothing special really and not worth $10!  The outdoor seating was kind of limited, but luckily there were a couple empty tables which were not tended to.  The misters could have been stronger and better aimed.  \n\nI may try to go to the original location AND eat there whenever I go to NYC, but as for this location, no thanks, it's overpriced & overrated!"

They are famous for this frozen hot chocolate. I find it's just chocolate milk with lots and lots of whip cream on it.  But their flavoured one are awesome. Super sweet but I love stuff that are super sweet in general so it's all good for me. I could have finished it all to myself but i decided to share with my friends. :) Don't want to be a fatty alone. haha. They also have a foot long hot dog. It was perfect to share that with 3 other girls who are small eaters. The portions for food is huge here. So, really nice to share it with your friends. \n\nService is kinda meh. It was hard for me to flag down our server cause we sat at the corner. It wasn't busy at all at around 7ish at night. \n\nOverall, not a bad place to try out and share food with others because there was no way I would have been able to eat all that by myself. I would recommend others to at least give this place a try if you're around."

Why one star then? Well..\n\nAfter I paid about $36 (tips included) for a $14 drink and a lame-ass $16 sandwich, I went home and spent the rest of the night doubled over with extreme, vastly unpleasant stomach pain. I don't know which food item caused it, but I'm talking about stomach pain that made me want to curl up next to the toilet and wish I had never visited Serendipity 3. \n\nWe started off with a frozen hot chocolate for my friend and a \"Raspberry Truffle\" (frozen hot choc + chambord + some other things) for me. The frozen hot chocolate was okay but I've had much better in Austin. The \"Raspberry Truffle\" was decent-tasting and was HUGE but the chocolate shavings and such were tasteless and didn't add much to the drink. Also, it got way too sweet after awhile so I didn't finish it.\n\nNext, entrees. My friend's salad looked mediocre. But $15 for a small-ish BBQ chicken pizza that Pizza Hut could have made better? And here's what I got.. $16 for an \"Open Bries\" sandwich with one slice of bread, a mound of sliced turkey very much like the packaged kind one gets at their local supermarket, a few slices of apple and some mayo with cranberries, topped with a few slices of brie? Yeah the sandwich was kind of huge, not to mention ridiculously hard to eat, but  the side that came with it (excellently seasoned waffle fries) was far tastier than the main dish. The concoction would have been better had it been fresh turkey.. not to mention more deserving of the $16 price tag.\n\nDon't come here.. not worth the price and potential wrath of hell to be instilled in your stomach."

If you don't know what it is, it's just a Chocolate Milkshake....without the ice cream.  We waited in line for 10 minutes just to place our order.  Here's why...there was one girl taking orders....and the SAME girl making the drinks!  Now after placing our order, apparently, workers inside saw the huge line building up outside the \"take-out\" window, and one extra person decided to help out.  Funny, because through the pick-up window, we could hear him talking $hit about the girl (the one taking orders) with another co-worker!  After all this $hit talking, our drink was ready.  For $15 (for a double), this is EXTREMELY overpriced!!  And I do mean EXTREMELY!!!  I'm not 100% sure, but I'm pretty sure there isn't supposed to be ice chunks in it.  I was basically chewing my drink.  WTF??!?!\n\nIf you're looking for a frozen drink, I'd suggest going to Starbucks and getting a Frappacino....or better yet, go to Coffee Bean and get one of their blended drinks.  Granted, it will be more expensive than your local SB or CB, but it'll still be cheaper, faster, and more importantly, TASTIER!\n\nAvoid this place!

It was nice and quiet, and we were right under a heat lamp.\n\nFOOD: Between the three of us we shared:\n- Thai Beef Salad: quite large (which made up for the $16.50 price tag), very flavorful. Lots of random inedible add-ins though (uncooked vermicelli noodles, half a coconut in shell, etc). \n- Side of Steak Fries: not your typical steak fries, these had an additional bread crumb (??) coating on the outside that made them extra crispy. Yum.\n- Can't Say No Sundae: OMG. This thing was monstrous. I wish I had taken some lactase pills or something because the amount of dairy I consumed that night was no bueno for my tummy. Man. This sundae was the size of my head. It includes a slice of whoopee pie (PB, but not that peanut buttery), coffee and vanilla ice cream, two bananas, and is topped off with a mountain of whipped cream and a cherry. Good lord. \n\nOVERALL: a fun place to try... once. If I ever come back, I will definitely be sharing anything I order... and probably no FHC."

There are several choices including oreo, amaretto, double chocolate, etc. We ended up getting the green tea and mint chocolate. Each Starbucks grande-sized cup was $11. I repeat. $11. Let that sink in as I move on....\n\nWhen we got our frozen hot chocolates, the cups were about 3/4-full and swirled with an unnecessarily large mountain of whipped cream and some tacky rainbow sprinkles. The green tea frozen hot chocolate was pathetic and bland as hell. A green tea frappuccino is better tasting and 1/3 of the price. We were in better luck with the mint chocolate. It actually tastes good; however, Serendipity still has no business selling this minuscule drink for $11.\n\nIf you want to delve into the enigma that is the \"frozen hot chocolate\", just go to Starbucks and order a frappuccino. If you're still curious and have to try one, get the mint chocolate so that you aren't completely disappointed! \n\nNote: I totally didn't mean to sound like a Starbucks salesperson, but in my opinion the frozen hot chocolate is just a glorified frapp!"

I also had a Groupon  - they have NO idea what to do with a Groupon!\n\nWe went into the restaurant and were told it was a 40 minute wait, even though the restaurant was mostly empty.  The hostess was not friendly at all.  We asked if we could use our Groupon outside at the take away place, and we were told we could.  We then went outside and waited in the hot sun for 25 minutes - slowest moving line ever!!  Finally got to the front only to be told that we can't use our Groupon there.  I asked nicely if she could kindly help up get a faster reservation inside, as we'd been given the run around, which she kindly did.\n\nWe spoke to a very nice female manager inside who said that it was her fault, she had told her hostess the wrong info, so she would take care of us.  We asked if we could  get the menu from outside, as we had waited already and had made up our minds what to order.  She let us know she'd take care of it.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, some horrible male manager came out and said he'd seat us, but we'd have to pay the prices inside (which were WAY higher), and he even scolded the female manager in front of us.  Horrible, horrible, horrible!  My husband got frustrated and let out a sound of frustration because we'd been so screwed around with and the male manager had the balls to actually threaten to call security...really???  YOU screw up, we show the tiniest bit of frustration, and THAT\"S how you treat us?  But then again, the way he treated the other manager was pretty atrocious, so I shouldn't be surprised.  \n\nWe were helped by the fabulous bartender, to whom we apologized that she had to deal with their mess.  We placed our order and after quite some time, finally got our food to take outside.  I had questioned some of the pricing, as not all of it had been changed.  We ended up getting overcharged $4, then another few dollars because we ordered a bacon cheeseburger, but guess what was missing???  The bacon.  Frustrated that we told the bartender that and she didn't offer to give us our $ back (esp. as we had given her a 40% tip, kind of by accident, but still).  NOT Impressed and will never go back.  The New York stores should be ashamed to be associated with this horrible place."

We are not picky people, so we are coming from a pretty low-key place....\n\nIf you are a fan of the quaint Manhattan bistro, Serendipity, don't come to this place. \n\nIf you are really on the jones about, or haven't experienced the Manhattan location and want to have a Frozen Hot Chocolate, step on in, but prepared to be underwhelmed by everything else. \n\nHaving visited the Manhattan location several times, how surprised was I to see a Serendipity on the Strip in Las Vegas. Wonderful! I thought, this should be fun.\n\nSadly, like anything good and decent left, this had been turned into a horrible corporate basterdised version of what is a charming little restaurant.\n\nWhen we arrived, (around 2:00) the restaurant was about 70% full inside. We stopped at the hostess stand where the two girls there informed us it would be a 20 minute wait for inside. Huh, says I, looking around, there are 4 tables here that are empty and just need to be bused. Thinking that the hostesses would pitch in and hussle to bus these tables and help the waitstaff... well...what was I thinking? My husband also asked them about his Players Club card from Caesars. Supposedly we got some sort of points or discount, whatever, but it was important to him. Again, just stares and finally one says, \"Oh, well, just give that to your waiter.\"  These girls had much better things to do, like debate their natural hair color, or stare at the wall and wonder why their heads didn't float away.\n\nAfter 20 minutes (and seeing there were now 5 empty, clean tables), I wandered back in and asked if they were ready for us.  The hostess asked me if I wanted to be put on the waitlist. No, I gently explained, we have a buzzer. Not only did she call me by the wrong name, but wanted to know if we wanted to sit outside..\n\nSigh. \n\nSomehow, even dealing with Bim and Bim, we managed to get sat. \n\n10 minutes later, our server appeared. No friendly introduction, no \"Hi, Welcome\" just \"What can I get you to drink?\" My husband asked about his Players Club card again, and the waiter looking like they had no idea what we were talking about, mumbled something about the hostesses or something at the end of the meal...my husband just closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose.\n\nWaters took another 5 minutes and thank God, after our 20 minute wait outside we knew what we wanted, or that would have been another 20 minutes waiting.\n\n The food was good. Solid enough and for Vegas pricing, not the worst I've seen. We got a couple appetizers: Sliders and Chicken Strips. The kitchen seemed overwhelmed by the 3 tickets in the window, which isn't a good sign and the manager was out expo-ing the line. Again, not a great sign of a restaurant you'd think should run like clockwork since it's not that busy. We were given our food (not by our server) and dug in. Sliders were good, a little dry, but the chicken strips were very good. I recommend them if you brave this place.\n\nTrying to save some sort of this experience, I attempted to engage our server in conversation, however that turned out to be teeth grinding, and my husband just started shaking his head. \n\nAll in all, we did get our frozen hot chocolate, but the experience deflated the fabulousness that this desert holds and I know for any future visits to Serendipity, I'll keep it out of Sin City and in the Big Apple."

We ended up coming here immediately off the plane (on a Wednesday) and after we checked into our hotel. We got lucky and found a Groupon here and really just wanted some frozen hot chocolate and appetizers to tie us over until dinner time, without having to eat a full meal. So we came in probably around 2PM - and the place is for the most is empty - we had our choice of sitting outside or inside, and we chose a center booth inside. The location of the restaurant is great - it's right on the strip - with outside seating facing the strip in front of Caesar's Palace - you get some good foot traffic here so it's good people watching :)\n\nOf note, even though it doesn't say so on your Groupon (fine print), you cannot utilize your Groupon with the Total Rewards (players card) discount. Not a big deal, it's a $1 savings, but it would be nice if they actually told us that. I'll also say - the waiters aren't super knowledgeable or they play stupid because they don't want a \"discounted tip\" - because our waiter told us we can't use our Groupon at all unless it's for full menu meals (non-appetizers). We again did not see any of this in the fine print, so we asked our waiter to ask his manager, who after 10 minutes visible begrudgingly came out and said yes we could use the Groupon for anything.\n\nWe ordered a large frozen hot chocolate ($17) and nachos ($18) - which was MORE than enough food to tie us over until dinner. It was a wonderful afternoon snack. Everything tasted GREAT - the frozen hot chocolate did not disappoint and neither did the nachos. So good job Serendipity on that! I've been to the Serendipity in NYC and the frozen hot chocolate is consistent and just as delicious in Vegas :)\n\nThe reason for the down score of 1 star - our waiter made some off handed rude comments about what we ordered - granted we ordered 1 desert drink and an appetizer for 2 people - we are not particularly large people, rather average - and he made a comment about being fat and eating too much - which we let slide as it was our first hour in Vegas - but I will say the looks from the table next to us was like WTF. They even commented to us at the end of their meal that it was ridiculous and totally unfounded what the waiter said (clearly tip was now a factor as we were not going to be insulted and tip 20% on pre-discounted meal - we tipped 15% on the pre-discounted meal - also begrudgingly)."

Our waiter was really nice too and he didn't charge us for the frozen hot chocolate because apparently there was some sort of mix up or something."

Next time my craving for a frozen hot chocolate hits me, I'll either get it to go or remind myself how expensive it is. \n\nWe've been to this location multiple times (when you have young kids, you kinda have to). Each time the service is okay, today's service was slow and the kitchen got one of our order wrong.. as simple as no powder sugar. We always share our food here and order something smaller but even then we still had too much food. Ordered the hangover omelette and that was actually good. Ordered the kids French toast, 2 regular pieces of toast for $8! Plain croissant larger than the norm $4! Ordered the frozen hot chocolate to go and that was $12! Forgot how expensive it was for a normal grande size drink! \n\nSpent $72 for a meal we shared and it was just a mediocre meal. I could have gone to Joe's stone crab and spent that much money for food 100x better. I'll make sure to read this review next time I crave a froho!"

We just wanted dessert so we ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate - one regular and one with a Mint Chip flavor.\n\nWe also ordered a slice of the cheesecake creme de la creme.\n\nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate was good - it didn't blow my mind but it was packed with chocolate flavor and had a slushy milk chocolate feel. The four of us shared one and that was enough for all of us. Four huge straws and a mound of whipped cream and chocolate chips on top. Nothing fancy, just a large quantity.\n\nThe slice of Cheesecake was HUGE. The cake wasn't overly sweet and had a wonderful cream cheese whipped cream on top that complimented everything pretty well. We worked our way eating around the cheesecake but could hardly make a dent in it! There is a raspberry jam at the bottom tjat also gave you a different take on the flavors. The cheesecake was my favorite.\n\nI'm docking off a star because of the price. It came out to be a nearly $50 check for hot chcocolate and cheesecake....the food was good but not that good. You could be paying for the ambiance, but it isn't to the level of 4 Stars like some other dessert places on the strip.\n\nBottom line: you can do it for the experience, but I'm sure there are better dessert places. What does the word serendipity mean anyway???"

Worst of all was the attitude--no one acted enthusiastic or friendly. Wouldn't you think an ice cream parlor would be friendly? The food was overpriced, there was a long wait for a table and the sundaes (in my opinion) were GOOD, but nothing earthshattering (and believe me....I've had plenty of earthshattering desserts!) The view of the Strip was the only thing that salvaged this waste of $50--yes, $50-- for two sundaes and a milkshake. I guess that's authentic NY prices for you."

Five minutes later, we were eventually seated outside with the view, which was very pleasant, along with the weather.  From that point on, the experience was great. We ordered the grilled artichoke with remoulade, an order of the pank crusted mac and cheese with truffle oil, sweet potato fries, and the double frozen hot chocolate for two.  The food was very good, much better than I expected. The artichokes were seasoned and grilled nicely, with a nice smokey flavor, and plenty of yummy dipping sauce. The macaroni was rich and decadent which the kids said was the best ever. The sweet potato fries came in this cute little [ail, and were crispy and well done.

I don't think Ill return again- it's one of those places where your like \"okay been there done that, no need to try again\". The portion are large but not that flavorful, kind of boring and expensive. Our table ordered breakfast and two frozen hot chocolates. The cookies and cream frozen hot chocolate is still the best, I strayed and ordered the Amaretto one, which was okay, but I felt like there was only a tiny bit of almond flavoring- so after the first few sips the flavor was gone. For breakfast we ordered the breakfast quesadilla and the breakfast sandwich- for the price I would rather of made these at home. \n\nSo I guess my point is go once, just to say you tried it, skip on the food and just get the frozen hot chocolate."

If i had a costco dog and put nacho cheese and jalapenos from am/pm...that would be ur las vegas dog. The mac n cheese lacked flavor.  I was real curious about the frozen hot chocolate, which is comparable to sugary chocolate milk blended in ice.  I probably wouldnt go back anymore. Too expensive for the quality of food you get."

Not too bad considering it was a Saturday and all. I didn't see much variety for food on the menu so just opted for an omelette. It came with a few pieces of potatoes...Anyway, the omelette was not good at all. It had no flavor, it was bland, and was just underwhelming. I guess it's not really their fault though, 'cause who goes to Serendipity 3 for food? Onto the frozen hot chocolate. IT WAS SO SWEET. Some people like that but for me, it was like drinking corn syrup by the gallon. I mean, it did satisfy my chocolate craving but only for the first three sips. They had other flavors like mint, strawberry, etc so if you wanted to try that, you could. \n\nEven though I'm not much of a fan, you should still stop by and experience it for yourself :)"

The large drink was ready in about 5 minutes...wow! It was freakin huge and it had about 4 inches of whipped cream on the top!\n\nAll 5 of us had a sip, and agreed that it was awesome, nice rich chocolate, thick and creamy, definitely a chocolate lover's dream come true. Unfortunately, since it was so thick, it was quite filling, and we ended up throwing over half of it away. We should have gotten a small.\n\nWhen in Vegas, I will come here again and split a small with somebody, it's cheaper and we will actually finish it!"

I didn't try them but they looked damn good (a ring tower for $11) - this place serves burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, and lots of novelty items like shakes and frozen hot chocolate. You'll pay for the food but hey, it's Vegas. The interior gives off a kitschy 50's vibe, our server was friendly and kept the fountain drink cups full. I'd bet this is a good place to visit after a few beers and the hamburgers can help soak up some of that alcohol! The burgers are served dry for some odd reason- you have to ask for the condiments and toppings. The fries are excellent, battered and crispy. So if you're in the mood for a quick dining option and good burgers head to S3 near Ceasars Palace. There's an outdoor seating area and also a quick order window to take away food (limited menu though)."

They handed us our menus and holy moly prices were so high! A fricken hot dog was $18!! Macaroni and cheese for $19!! Ugh! I was craving a hot dog too! So even though I didn't agree with the price of the $18 hot dog, I still got it!.. My husband got the Sliders for $18. We paid $1 extra for bacon, but they didn't put the bacon! My husband said the sliders were really good and flavorful, but so small! My hotdog was a 12\" hotdog that came naked with a little plate of sauerkraut on the end.

It comes in a large plastic cone with petals so that it's easy to share, walk, and eat.

Even though the wait was excruciatingly long, the NYC frozen hot chocolate more than made up for it.\n\nFast forward a week later and here I was in Vegas for my sister's 21st birthday. I was excited to learn that Serendipity's had a location out here especially since it's much closer to me than New York.  Located along the strip, in a stand alone building, right outside of Cesars, our wait was only 20 minutes.  We were seated in the outside patio area which would've been nicer if the tall shrubs didn't block our view of the strip.  I suppose the 'barrier of shrubs' were put in place because of the loud noise along the strip and the very close proximity of people walking up and down the strip. The menu is a bit expensive for regular fare food: $10 appetizers, $15 hot dogs/burgers, etc. However,  the size of their food items are pretty gigantic so my sister and I split a burger with waffle fries which ended up being fine....except of course for their sharing charge! We had the ABC burger which included Avocado, Brie, & Caramalized onions. It was pretty good and pretty filling.  The waffle fries were well cooked, although they went a little overboard with the seasoning.\n\nOnto the frozen hot chocolate: UGH. After taking my first sip, I replayed a possible scene in my head: throwing a tantrum like a 2 year old in front of everyone present and whining, \"This is NOT the same as the one I had in NYC!  This is blended beyond belief into a liquid mess without the frothy icy texture! It's also waaaaaaay too sweet.  I want another one (arms folded, sour face with a big pout)!\"  But of course, one can only dream.\n\nI'd actually come back to try some of their other foods (salads, sandwiches, and pizzas), but I'd pass on the frozen hot chocolate. They also have a sundae called the \"Golden Opulence.\" No other description except for its price: $1,000. Out of sheer curiosity,  if I had the cash, I'd actually spend it just to see what this sundae has to cost so much. Anyway,  I suppose going to the original Serendipity's in NYC just gave me too much of an expectation for Sin City's Serendipity's."

When we got in line, there was only a couple in front of us waiting for a table, and we were told the wait would be 30 minutes unless we wanted to sit at the bar. Since we had been walking all day and were really hungry, we opted to sit at the bar. Well, the bar ended up being fairly small, so maybe we should have waited. Once seated, the blonde bartender took a while to give us a menu and seemed to be in a bad mood. While waiting to place our order, we overheard her complaining to the other bartender that everyone at the bar was drinking water and it was too busy. Well, people were sitting at the bar because the restaurant itself was full, and they wanted to eat. Also, when it is 112 degrees outside, it is important to stay hydrated. Plus, it was the 4th, so of course it was busy. The other  bartender was incredibly nice and took our order and kept our water glasses full...she even re-filled my water bottle for free. The food is okay, but it is definitely overpriced, even for being on the strip. My triple-decker grilled cheese and cup of soup was $15 and a side of onion rings I think was $8 and I got like 5 onion rings....definitely not worth it. Did not get a Frrrrozen Hot Chocolate this time because I just didn't feel like spending another $11. I would have given another star, but the rude bartender really turned me off and the fact that the bar only has about ten chairs.

Overall great place to get a good burger and enjoy the strip while you eat. Sitting on the strip is a must!"

When my friend and I showed up, there was barely anyone there. Our server was Greg, he was super friendly and nice. I loved his recommendations and the frozen hot chocolate was amazing. Greg definitely made a difference between us being upset with how we were treated over the phone. I'm definitely coming back, though whoever took our reservations over the phone needs to change their attitude. Just because we don't see you, doesn't mean we deserve your rude customer service."

Well what do you know.....the fozen hot chocolate is in short....a chocolate shake!  that cost $10.00!  for 16oz cup which we ordered at the Grab N Go window, and $11.50 for a banana split!   Also, they charge a $1.00 for tap drinking water to pay the cost for the plastic drinking cups.  You're already paying the costly prices for food and they still want to charge you for plastic cups at a $1.00.   So bottom line,  we are never  going back to this place! not in Las Vegas and not in NYC!   So not worth it on the frozen hot chocolate!  I'll stick to my Ghirardelli sundaes and milk shakes (aka frozen hot-chocolate)!"

We had to wait 30 minutes for a table, which is worth it for a frrrozen hot chocolate in my opinion. So we went to the bar to wait. It was 1030 in the morning, so we asked for coffee and were told by Raymond the bartender that \"he didn't have time\" to go inside and get us coffee. Mind you, our group of six girls were the only people sitting outside at the bar. When we got to our table we ordered our drinks and food, and one guest ordered the sweet potato fries specifically for the Chipotle marshmallow dipping sauce. Which the server forgot, and took another 25 minutes to bring to us  and she gave us the excuse that they had to make the sauce for it.. all in all we are pretty disappointed with our experience here and will not be back next vegas trip."

            "review": "What stays in New York apparently comes to Las Vegas. If you never get to venture out East for the original Serendipity's, no worries, just hit sin city!\n\nWe ate a lot. So prepare yourself for a comprehensive review. ;)\n\nWent to Vegas this past weekend with friends and had the chance to visit Serendipity's on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  We caught the restaurant during the soft opening, and had a great experience!\n\nIf you are walking off the strip along LV Boulevard and up the stairs into the restaurant you are greeted by a host podium in the shape of a woman's bust! They weren't swamped, so you leave your name with the host in the merchandise corner inside the restaurant and get a buzzer.\n\nThe Vegas location indoors is expansive compared to the NY location, with patio seating wrapping around the restaurant, as well as a To-Go window.  (More space here meant no stranger's elbow in your side or waiter's tray nicking you in the head here!!!) Unlike NY, the only doo-dads and randoms the LV location sells are Serendipity-branded merchandise, as well as a few sweets.  \n\nThe staff manages to utilize small space well, as seen in the bar and the open kitchen.  The bar is colorful and entertaining, with wispy cotton candy filling glass jars for the signature Cotton Candy martinis, and their ever-so popular Frrrozen Hot Chocolates lining up on the counters ready to be served. \n\nOur wait was 20-30 minutes, during which my friends ordered a couple drinks, two of which names I can't remember, but they were yummy. While they worked on their buzz we hung out in the large courtyard outside overlooking fountains and (at least for this particular weekend) a Thai shrine.\n\nOur waiter was Allen, and he was able to deal with the 6 of us while remaining playful yet attentive.  AMAZING guy!  We were seated outdoors with a view of the strip with the traffic and the throngs of drunks and tourists! If its a nice day out, I would definitely choose to sit outdoors!  Another friend ordered another drink, a mojito-like one with cranberries, and it was WAY too sour for my taste.\n\nThe menu looked similar New Yorks, HOWEVER there were menu items that were made specially for the Las Vegas location. We ended up ordering:\n\nPopcorn & Shrimp\nPopcorn shrimp served with popcorn! :) My friend squeezed lemon all over this and we had our choices of creamy sauces on the side.  The shrimp was delicious, the batter not being too heavy or cloying.  \n\nBreakfast Steak Sandwich\nGet this if you're hungover. A New York steak cooked to order was topped with 4-5 eggs, all piled on a 12 inch crunchy baguette.  The baguette is as crunchy as a Lee's Sandwiches' Banh Mi.  With that said, there's a chance its crunchy enough to cut the roof of your mouth ;) Other than the fact that she wished she ordered the steak cooked medium, she was happy with it. Runny yolks over meat and crispy bread? Rawr.\n\nThe Rachel Sandwich\nI opted for the Sweet Potato Fries with this order.  The fries were meh, I'd try the chips next time or stick with waffle fries.  Although I'm not much of a fan of coleslaw, a newbie to pastrami, and not a fan of raisins, this sandwich was AMAZING.  The Rachel sandwich is the female counterpart to the Reuben; a rich hefty portion of well-seasoned pastrami piled on with a crunchy, flavorful bed of coleslaw, all sandwiched on dark raisin bread.  The whole thing was then thrown onto a grill, for a crisp finish. Needless to say, I shared, but I pretty much ate the whole thing.\n\nPizza\nDidn't taste this, but heard no complaints. Flat bread pizza, served on a paddle. Standard sauce and cheese topped with mushrooms.\n\nMac and Cheese\nF*ing delish. Creamy and not-overly salty like many restaurants.  Noodles cooked to a great consistency with a killer combination of cheeses.\n\nDeep Fried Oreos & Ice Cream\nMy friend ordered this for his entree and it was delicious and rich- the classier version of county fair food ;) Served in a large parfait glass on a plate to catch the melting ice cream and overflowing chocolate sauce. The consistency of the whipped cream was something we couldn't get over.  It was thick and wouldn't melt like standard whipped cream, yet was still SO airy and light.  Must've been made fresh. The oreos themselves were fried correctly, and was abundant in the dessert, with my friend finding another one or two in hiding.\n\nABC Burger\nThis was the Avocado, Brie, and Caramelized Onions burger, served with standard burger toppings on the side.  Magical freakin combination!  My friend ordered this with waffle fries which were perfectly crispy and fresh. \n\nFrrrozen Hot Chocolate\nOne of those things you just kind of have to get once. Delish.\n\nAll this with various sodas and waters, which were constantly refilled. Allen was able to split our checks, told you he was amazing!\n\nPricey, but all in all, food, service, ambiance were superb."

A little steep at $14 (for a \"large,\" $11 for a \"single\").  My mochaccino was quite yummy.  My brother's Tiffany espresso was tiny, with sprinkles.  Interesting and cute, but an extra $1 for a few sprinkles?  I dunno...  The onion rings came in this impressive stack, about 8 total.  Nice and thick.  The salty was welcome after so much sweet.\n\nThe waiter also suggested the nachos, sliders, and hot dogs.  We didn't get them, but we did see neighboring tables with them.  Had we not had dinner plans in a few hours, we might have tried them too.\n\nAll in all, an OK experience.  Not sure if it's worth all the hype, price, and wait, but perhaps worth at least one visit if you've never been, just cuz the ambiance is pretty cute.  Perhaps a stop by the \"To Go\" window outside in the future..."

Nearby patrons gaped at the cake and took photos with their large lenses as I attempted to make a dent into this monster of a slice.\n\nSadly, size was not the only difference. It tasted like a cake I could buy at Safeway for 3 dollars. And the Safeway ones are more satisfactory because I don't expect much.

One of our friends ordered the chicken and waffle and the portion was very big. I tried it and the waffle was too dough-y for me but the chicken was pretty good. I am not a big fan of fried foods so I would never order that. For dessert, we ordered the frozen hot chocolate of course because of the hype. It was good but I would probably not order it again for $12. I feel like I can make something similar at home. \n\nThe decor inside and outside of the restaurant was very pretty and the waitress was extremely nice. We loved her."

Noticed there were many open tables and numerous servers working the patio . . . After we were seated, we waited almost 15 minutes to be greeted / acknowledged, We noticed that the two tables that were sat after us already had drinks and their order being taken.  When our server arrived his first words spoken \" Are you ready to order?\" Huh? I said to myself and the confused look on my friend's face she expressed. My friend ordered the Cotton Candy Martini and his reply was \"That's gonna be a very sweet drink and I got the impression that he really didn't want to serve this drink, but she said yes she would like this drink and noticed a reluctant expression on his face. When receiving our drinks, you could tell this \"presentation\" drink wasn't high on his list.  While he shook this drink, some sprayed on us and he did a poor pour over the cotton candy.  Cut to the food - very good Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Crab Cake Sandwich. The wraps were very moist and flavorful, the crab cake had very little filler and so much crab - 5 stars for food and  her drink. But back to the service, while we were dining,  he was doing his side work, refilling salt and pepper shakers without excusing himself as he reached over us. And even though we were not quite down dining he tried to clear our plates - twice! Wanted to order dessert, but why bother him, he was at the railing gazing at The Strip. I'm kinda sorry we left a 10% tip, should of left 5%."

I ordered the Hangover Omelette. I really enjoyed it so I took home the left overs. The next morning, while chewing on a bite, I heard hard loud crunch. I though it was an egg shell at first, but when I felt around and spit it out, I found it was A PIECE OF GLASS ALMOST A CM LONG AND HALF A CM WIDE!!!!\n\nThis was literally right now and I was in Vegas yesterday. \n\nOne side is rounded, smooth and shiny, while the other side is jagged and matte. I think its a chip from a plate or something. I am now freaking out wondering if I have already ingested any other pieces.\n\nSince I'm not in Vegas and I discovered this at home, I think that calling them and telling them this will just make me look like a crazy person or something.\n\nThis is why I'm compelled to write this review."

Arrived around 12:30 and put our names down and got one of those little buzzer things that lets you know when your table is ready.  We got some snacks at the to-go window to hold us over for the 45 minute wait and sat near the bar.\n\nThe buzzer makes a beeping noise 20 minutes in, so one of us walks up to the hostess and she looks at him like he's crazy and tells him to go sit back down cause our table isn't ready. We wait, we wait, we wait we wait....well over the 45 minutes we were initially told (with no beep from our buzzer thingy) and another one of us heads up to the hostess only to be informed that we were marked as \"no show\" and they've gone 3 or 4 people past on the waiting list.  Promises of a table in 20 minutes are made, we all gather and gang up and the wait drops to 5 minutes.  \n\nOur server was super busy, so she wasn't especially attentive to our table.  Things were forgotten, checking in was infrequent, it was hard to flag her down if we needed something...we also wanted to order off the lunch menu, but brunch doesn't end until 2pm...so we wait some more...since it was 1:40 by the time we were seated.\n\nFood finally arrived, and for the price it was terrible.  There's not much to say...the portions were huge, but what's the point if it doesn't taste good?? Fried chicken was soggy, the grilled cheese was also soggy and kind of weird tasting and the frozen hot chocolate, although presented nicely, contained more whip than chocolate and turned watery pretty quick.  The reuben was meh...but if the best thing on the table is only a mediocre tasting reuben that cost $15...well...it's infuriating.\n\nLas Vegas is filled with restaurants that are, without much effort, better than this place.  Go somewhere else when you're in town unless you're completely drunk (e.g. you don't care if your food is kinda gross) and you just won some money in the casino to waste on this place."

            "review": "Serendipity 3 at Caesars Palace was probably one of the restaurants I was most looking forward to trying in Las Vegas and also was the most disappointing.  We asked to sit outside along the strip and were told there was a 10-15 minute wait.  We ventured outside to wait at the bar and noticed at least 5 tables with no occupants which still had people's used plates, glasses and leftover food sitting out.  The floor had garbage underneath nearly every table and there was dirt smudges all over the black and white checkered floor.  We decided to wait inside, which was also not clean.  My boyfriend made a good point, which was if the restaurant was this dirty, what did the kitchen look like?  If I'd been at home, we would have left, but I really wanted to try the Frrrozen hot chocolate!\n\nWe waited close to 10 minutes and were then seated at a table outside.  It looked like ours and another table had been cleaned but there were no silverware settings.  The other 3 tables near us were still covered in unwanted food remnants.  Our table was next to the trash can/service area and two old chairs, one of which had a cigarette burn all the way through the cushion.  Charming.\n\nThe Frrrozen hot chocolate is billed as a blend of 20 different kinds of chocolate in \"an icy cocoa concoction.\"  I ordered the regular size as well as three deep fried oreos.  Oreos are not listed on the menu individually, but our server advised I could order them at $1.50 each.  We also asked for waters which I had observed on each table with huge blue and pink straws.  Not too long after, my hot chocolate and oreos arrived.  Still had no water and no silverware.  I asked the server for water again.  If you see my photo of the hot chocolate, it had clearly been sitting in the kitchen for a little while, as it was presented to me with part of the drink melted in the plate below.  A well-attended kitchen would have been sure to switch out the plate before presenting this $12 drink to a customer.  Further, you can see that only half of the glass contains the actual hot chocolate.  The rest is filled with whipped cream.\n\nThe frrrozen hot chocolate was tasty, but I did not detect even a hint of there being 20 different kinds of chocolate, and I find that claim somewhat suspect.  It did not take long to finish the chocolate part of the drink, which was disappointing, given I had almost an entire glass of whipped cream remaining.  The oreos were battered in corn flakes, which I had never seen before.  Not the prettiest presentation, but they were tasty.  I finally got my water and napkins close to the time I was finishing my food.  Surprisingly, my server told me at that time that my oreos were on the house.  \n\nOverall, I would say to skip Serendipity 3 on your Las Vegas visit.  It clearly is not well-managed and its servers are not set up to succeed.  I saw a group of women at another table complaining to the manager about waiting over an hour for their food.  He didn't really seem to care, at least from my vantage point.  Gone is the Serendipity 3 you may have seen featured on tv as I did, which seemed to show a well-kept, high end dessert shop.  No one in their right mind would order the famous $1,000 sundae containing real gold flakes from this establishment."

If you're lucky enough to sit on the patio overlooking Las Vegas Blvd, you've probably got one of the best people-watching views on the whole Strip.\n\nWe arrived on the Strip just in time to take advantage of a late breakfast and were lucky enough to have a front seat to all the action.  Okay, so the prices are a little steep but food items were huge!  I do mean huge.  If we had known that to begin with, we would have ordered one meal and split it.  Service was almost perfect ... not quite but almost.  Food was great.  Not many complaints here for us.\n\nWould we return?  Absolutely!"

It's silky smooth icy texture is hard to explain. It is nothing like a Slush Puppy nor a Wendy's Frosty. It's just perfect and leave you wanting more. Both the Original and the Peanut Butter version is delicious. I didn't think I could finish one on my own after my HUGE dinner but I did!\n\nNachos: WoW! Huge! and Delicious! Comes with Guac, Pico De Gallo and Sour Cream on the side.\n\nABC (Avocado. Brie and Caramelized onions) Burger. Sweet potato fries were a little soggy. Burger was okay. Just Okay. Brie was overpowering.\nChicken Caesar Salad: It comes as 2 hearts, dressed with sauce. Bread so you can make your own croutons and Chicken the size of 2 chicken breasts. This was pretty good but not the best I've ever had.\nBBQ pizza was a bit salty but good.\n\nI would definitely go again and try a different flavor of the Frozen Hot Chocolate."

I had brunch and ordered the corned beef hash. It was flavorful, but I seemed like it had been sitting out a while before it got to me. The food was a little dry and my eggs tasted like rubber. Not good. And the service was a little slow. Granted it was a busy day, but our server hardly came over to check on is to see if we needed anything. Another downside was my aunt wanted to order a hot dog but the waiter said that he would have to check since it was brunch hours. He never came back to let us know we couldn't order it. For dessert I ordered the mine frozen hot chocolate. I had been wanting to try that one. Unfortunately I can't say it was my favorite. I will probable stick to regular of peanut butter next time.

I would love to have been able to try the food and write a review based on that, but unfortunately I didn't even have the opportunity to try their food so my review is solely based on SERVICE.\n\nI came in on a Monday morning which meant that it was fairly slow. We had to walk around asking the waiters if we sit anywhere or if there was someone to seat us, in which they just pointed to one direction and told me to speak with the hostess. Not a big deal. After we spoke to the hostess, she was able to seat us down promptly and gave us menus. The waitress came by with waters for us and told us she'd be back shortly to take our order. 15 minutes later, she came to take our drink order. A friend of mine ordered a coke and the rest of us was content with our water. She came back with the coke and left sooner than we could ask to put our order in. So we sat there patiently and waited for her. 15 minutes later, we see her walking around and talking to customers and still have not come back to simply take our order. At this point, we ran out of patience and decided to leave. Right when we were about to leave, she came back and asked if we were ready. I told her that we decided to leave instead and she had the nerve to charge my friend for her UNTOUCHED coke. We were so furious that we just gave her the EXACT cash and left. Didn't take her name or collect the reciept which I wish I would have so I could include it this review.\n\nI am very big on service, but I am understanding in certain scenarios. But 30 mins of waiting on a slow day to simply take our order is definitely unacceptable. I don't even care to try their food anymore. It seemed overpriced and nothing special. Instead, I walked across the street to The Quad and had Hash House instead; for half the price, the service was top knotch and it was extremely busy there. You can read my review for that location because I will definitely be giving them a five star after compared to this horrible experience with Serendipity 3."

It seemed like just another family type restaurant, but I kept getting surprised as my experience unfolded.  The first surprise came when we where led out to a eating area on a balcony overlooking the strip, beautiful view of the Flamingo and there were heaters to keep us warm, we sat in a U shape so we could all enjoy the view.  Our waitress was super friendly and accommodating.  Something I immediately noticed on the menu was a root beer float cocktail, I obviously had to get it, and it did not disappoint...although it was really more of a dessert.  The onion ring appetizer was fancy and delicious.  My brie/turkey sandwich was alright, i'd get something else next time, but the true stars were the fries!  The best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten, they had a hint of maple syrup that was amazing...and the seasoned waffle fries my companions ordered were just as awesome.  Also ordered was an enormous hot dog that came with a bunch of fixings on the side including guacamole and dijon mustard...it looked delicious.  The drinks were pretty expensive, but it's Vegas, whaddya gonna do?  Food was reasonably priced.  Overall, the definite highlight of my Vegas trip and a new place to come back to next time!"

LOVE. Although it's right outside of Caesar's Palace and all by itself.\n\nAs far as the SERVICE?  Fail, FAIL, fail, fail - what a joke.  You have got to be kidding me.  No one knows WTF they're doing there or their purpose of working at that place is, everyone is completely disheveled and unorganized and probably high off of something.\n\nPrices? EHH, not so much worth it. I'd rather eat a full meal (which I did beforehand) than spend way too much money for average food there.\n\nI went there with 3 other people to get a taste of their frozen hot chocolate (I've heard wonders about it) and thank god that made up for the terrible service we received.  I've read on here that the wait time to be seated is obnoxious ... we didn't EVEN have to wait (maybe because it was a weekday).  In fact, the restaurant wasn't even CLOSE to being full, but we ended up waiting for SERVICE. Can't ever win with this restaurant, can you?\n\nThe hostess sat us down and we waited at our table right under the Serendipity poster (ooh so exciting, for me at least!) for about 10 minutes with about 3 waiters/waitresses walking by our table multiple times.  Did anyone offer to take our order?  No.  We even managed to go out of our way from looking at the menu, to purposely lock eyes with the employees breezing on by, and NOT ONE WORD from any one of them.  I even saw from what looked like to be the manager, \"managing\" the kitchen (which is in plain view for customers).  It's too bad that that 'manager' obviously doesn't know how to manage their employees.  Thank you beautiful, Kate & John, for being so romantic on that poster hanging on the wall and for entertaining me for that 10 minutes of no service.\n\nSo, while attempting not to die from heat exhaustion, all 4 of us got up and walked to the bar.  You think if you physically got up and moved to a location with a bartender, you'd get some service.  Bahahaha, NO!  Not at all.  After 5 minutes of sitting at the bar with unpleasant facial expressions written across all of our faces, the bartender finally noticed us.  After he handed us menus, we told him that we had already sat down, no one helped us at the table so that's why we went to the bar, and we obviously already knew what we wanted to order.\n\n/// Bartender: \"Oooh, so you already sat down eh?  Oh well I'm sorry about that [obviously not in a genuine voice, more like a 'sucks to be you!' tone]. Well, you know there's more than those flavors listed on the menu for the frozen hot chocolate.  We have a menu just for the frozen hot chocolate flavors.\"\n\nI don't care if you have a WHOLE other menu just for frozen hot chocolate, I just wanted to order my double oreo frozen hot chocolate and indulge in its party-in-your-mouth taste.\n\nAfter enjoying the frozen hot chocolate (which is huge, wish there was less whip cream in it) we ended up waiting another 10 minutes to get our bill ....... then another 5 minutes for the bartender flirting with the single chicks on the side of us to give us our bill ......... and another 5 minutes for him to take our credit cards and swipe them ........ and then, well, MORE WAITING.\n\nI would only go back here IN DESPERATION to get the frozen hot chocolate because the experience was SHITTY and the food's EXTREMELY over-priced. I've had better experiences from casino waitresses on the gambling floor. Other than that, I'd rather hold out and go to the original one in New York. Good luck, future victims!"

Sure you win, but it definitely leaves you with an empty feeling inside. \nMy girlfriend and I checked out Serendipity 3 for dinner on a busy Sat night in Sin City. The location is out of the way, so you either have to walk though Ceaser's or the Bellagio to get there because there is no direct parking. \nWe first encountered a girl outside at the check in booth after a short wait. We told her we were just a party of 2 and she said it would be 20-35mins for seating indoors, and about 20mins for outdoor seating. We took the buzzer thing to wait for indoor seating and I asked if there was a bar inside we could wait at, and she told us it was right inside. As we walked up to the bar, I noticed napkins, silverware, and condiments strewn across the bar, inclining me to ask the bartender if we could eat at the bar (which was empty with 8 stools!), he told us definitely. So proceeded to return to the booth girl and hand her back the buzzer and told her she should let people know that bar seating is an option with no wait.\nOnce seated, we took a look at the eclectic menu and decided on the Dino Ribs for me, and the Chicken Alfredo for my girl. As we were waiting for our food, two more couples came to the bar with their buzzers and realized there was seating and returned the buzzer, lol. \nIt took about 20 mins for our food to arrive, a lil too long I think for what we ordered. As we waited, the bartender basically had zero personality and only asked for our drink orders and then pretty much ignored us until we had to pay. \nThe Dino Ribs were three huge ribs that was a good portion size for the $20 price tag, and the Chicken Alfredo was probably 3lbs of pasta! The only real problem with the food though, is that it's not knock your socks off good. For the prices they charge for simple items, I expected to be blown away, and that definitely was not the case. It seemed to me, the real reason to visit Serendipity 3 is for the desserts, they're huge and extravagant, they even have a $1,000 dish! We actually didn't opt for dessert because of our lackluster experience. If I ever go back, it'll be strictly to try the dessert, maybe they can wow me then, otherwise, there are much better options on the Strip than Serendipity 3."

While everything was pricey, the portion size was more than enough.  We tried both the frozen hot chocolate as well as the black and white sundae.  Both were totally different experiences.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate was similar to a frappucino, only bigger and it didn't seem as sweet.  The black and white sundae was so good, with chocolate and white fudge sauce.\n\nI would look forward to going back, but I would count this as a meal (which is what we did - it was our \"kid\" dinner)."

If the food actually had some flavor to it or was ACTUALLY COOKED, the price would be worth it. My friend and I ordered the mac and cheese, hamburger slides, and the famous water-tasting like frozen hot chocolate. The food was not cooked and the frozen hot chocolate tasted like it was ran down with water, which I think was the case. The macaroni noodles were super hard because they were undercooked and the hamburger patty was blood-red inside. How gross. Even if you want to check this place out and try the frozen hot chocolate, make sure to get a small as it is enough for 2-3 people. They trick you by asking would you like one for one person or however many people are in your party just to empty your pocket. It was definently not worth a 45 minute wait in the hot, sticky weather in vegas.\n\nP.S. Don't wear one of your favorite shirts here. I don't know what is wrong with their tables but if you push down on the table with your elbow or hand while you are dining, your table will tilt and your food and drinks will go everywhere. While we were eating, the people next to us put their elbow on the table and their water cups flew into the air and spilled everywhere. Funny thing is, 5 minutes later I was getting up to go to the restroom and put my hand on the table to get up and the next thing you know, my cup of iced cold water spilled all over me and onto the floor. On my way to the bathroom, another party had a water spill which proved that the customers aren't clumsy, their tables are bad! My point being is, don't wear your favorite outfit here."

After making our  drink and food orders. I saw the staff singing happy birthday to a little girl. I then asked Lance if his staff could do the same for my fiance since it was his birthday. He told me he was going to see what he could do. So after having our dinner we got our frozen hot chocolate. And I flagged lance down and asked why they didn't sing happy birthday.. ... he said he didn't do it for anyone no older then 12 yrs old! I was like (WTF) are you serious?! He then goes on to say \"you can sing him happy birthday and I can give you a candle\" So when he got the candle he yelled out \"everybody lets hear it for this guy it's his birthday today! and said \"now you can sing him happy birthday\" and walked away! My fiance and I looked at each other like omg! Seriously WTF was that? I would have given him ANY STARS! On our way out of Las Vegas we had called the next morning to complain to a manager to let him know what happened and Mike told my fiance that Lance tends to do what he wants at night but he was still supposed to accommodate us for what we wanted (So basically he refused to do that service for me! what a Jerk! ) and Mike apologized and told us to come in that night for a complementary dinner on the house. My fiance told him we were about to board a plane to go to CA. at the time. So Mike said the next time we were be in town to Look him up! ... So in October of last year we went back and spoke to a fairly new manager and told him of our experience and gave us a great server by the name of Lori. She was very helpful in helping us decide which foods were good, and she was from were we originally were from was San Jose, CA. She knew exactly what mall my fiance and I worked at and what area it was in! How cool was that! She did a way better job than Lance did tending to our needs and always checked up on us to see if we were doing OK. That's the kind of customer service that people should always get which is the reason why I gave 3 stars."

If someone asks for suggestions about a specific plate u think they would try to figure out what kind of taste ur lookin for and have some kind of suggestions. But her comment was \"the hangover omelet is the popular one\" that really didn't help me decide on the dish. And since it was popular the. Y not try it. I should have stuck to my first choice and ordered the corned beef and hash. Don't think that could ever get messed up. Other than getting burnt potatoes. \n\nYou think paying 15 for an omelet it would be spectacular. But it wasn't. I satisfied my craving with a nations hotdog... Well worth my $12.

It was worth the wait, cool chocolate decadence!!!! It was 17 dollars definitely recommend. Also sit outside is worth it!"

We ended up sharing a single between two people. This is really what you go for (and the banana split the next table ordered was both monstrous and looked delicious)...\n\nThe food was mediocre at best. The mac & cheese was really light on flavor, and the burger & fries was extremely dry. Had to drink a few glasses of water to get through it.\n\nIt was kind of nice to go to say I've been, but will definitely be passing on any future trips."

We came on a Sunday morning around 8:45 and were seated right away. The interior of the restaurant is bright and inviting and servers are friendly. My friend and I split the banana waffles since the portions coming out of the kitchen were pretty big. When the waffles arrived, we received 2 of them which were topped with bananas, whipped cream and chocolate. The whipped cream was thick and creamy and perfectly paired with the crispy waffles. We were more than satisfied after splitting this dish.\n\nTo finish off our breakfast, we knew we had to try Serendipity's famous frozen hot chocolate. We ordered the small and it was delicious. Once again the whipped cream was phenomenal. The frozen hot chocolate was lighter than a milkshake and more comparable to a shushie or slurpee. We devoured all of it. I think we need a Serendipity in Chicago too!"

The place is very playful and it had Alice in Wonderland touches. We sat outside on a cold evening but with the heat lamps going it was perfect. I ordered hot chocolate because of the cold night and it was not as decadent as I hoped it would be. It tasted like something I can put together at home and I was looking for more. \nSeveral food items were ordered that were ok. I tasted the chili which was too thick for my taste and the triple grilled cheese sandwich was huge. It was ok but nothing special. The best part of the meal was the creamy tomato bisque. \nThis location is known for its sweets and the menu has lots to choose from. We ordered a small sundae and it was still huge! I did taste it and the hot fudge was great! \nOverall a fun experience with the outside location and the service was great. The food can use some work...\nSpend the money on more quality ingredients and the ratings shall improve."

To this day, I'm still a bit puzzled why this place is so raved about...\n\nOn a typical summer Sunday, your wait will be pretty long for a large group. The restaurant itself is fairly small in Vegas standards, so be prepared. We were seated on the outside patio, because that's the only place that could accommodate a group of 12. Even though it was in the shade, it was HOT. Blazing Vegas hot. For some odd reason, the mist fans don't come on until noon, so we were left there sitting for an hour without any relief but our water. It's really not that hard to turn off the timers, guys...\n\nThe meal itself was nothing special. I ordered the Fried Chicken & Waffles, which came with 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, one bacon waffle, potatoes, honey mustard and ketchup. The chicken was heavily breaded and was pretty dried out and flavorless. The only thing that added taste to it was the honey mustard. The bacon waffles were alright initially, but they get pretty unbearable after 1/4 of a waffle. The entire dish is just bland and flavorless. I understand they're trying to be unique here with the bacon waffles, but it's definitely not worth $22. \n\nFor the finale, all of us got the famed highly spoken of frozen hot chocolate. This was the biggest disappointment of the day. For $11, you're basically paying for a huge watered down chocolate milk with some whipped cream on top. That's exactly how it tastes. I experienced no wow factor and I seriously don't see what all the hype is about. It cools you down, but other than that, it's not that great."

We didn't know where to have lunch so we all settled on Serendipity since we were already there. \n\nWe walked in and asked for a table for 8. The hostess responds,\"It's going to be an hour wait.\" In a rude and I hate my job and hate customers voice. Which made no sense because all of the outside patio was empty and half of the inside was empty. So we said ok we will be right back. We go outside and discuss if we still want to eat here. Half of our group said never mind. So me and three others decide to eat here. We go back inside and tell the exact same hostess table for 4. She responds with,\"We can't split parties!\" (In her I hate you people voice). First of all, did i say we were being split parties? No. Do you see the rest of my group here? No. Did you make a HUGE 'ol assumption? Yes. So after I nicely said to her,\"Oh it's just the 4 of us the rest of our friends decided to pass.\" She gave us a disgusted look and proceeded to seat us. \n\nWe sat down, our server came and greeted us about 5 minutes later & took our drink order. The food was ok and overpriced (not surprised). \n\nBasically came here to give this place a shot. The whole one hour wait time didn't make any sense because we were there eating about an hour and it didn't get busy at all and our food still took forever. \n\nI would come back but probably will just order to go instead of dealing with their rude and untrained hostesses. \n\nThe job of a hostess is to greet customers. They're the first person customers interact with and the fact that we had a rude one was just unacceptable. I have worked as a server and hostess before and honey that is not how it's done! I hope she didn't get tipped out!"

You literally could split one meal between 2 people. We ordered the fried chicken tenders/waffles and the hangover omelet.

Thinking back, I'm not sure I would've paid $12 for that bowl of overly sweet, frrrrroze hot chocolate in 50 degree rainy weather. It seemed like such a good idea at the time....My friend and I also shared the mac & cheese which looked and smelled amazing, but the cheese was too overwhelming and neither of us could finish it. Which is very disappointing as we both LOVE mac & cheese, so it's saying a lot when we couldn't finish. The only thing about the night that had a unanimous raving review is the SWEET POTATO FRIES!

Can't read 1450 reviews, but i have never encountered a breakfast dish as tasty and unusual as the Frrrrrozen Hot Chocolate....wait for it......French Toast. It was actually triple stacked and the bread must have been dipped in the stuff and grilled which killed the grainy flavor that is found in the drink (I tried a shot of the stuff which was included in my Restaurant week 3 course breakfast). Ok back to this breakfast masterpiece which was topped with some chocolate syrup, whipped cream, a load of fresh strawberries and the pista resistance - whole pistachio nuts. I sent a photo of this thing to people and some thought it looked like a giant hamburger. You barely will need the maple syrup and this is just clearly something you can't find anywhere else. For rest. week, it was packaged with an outstanding triple berry smoothie ($6 normally) and then the third couse was mini-chocolate chip cookies filled with cookie dough ice cream (solid). Tourists don't care what they pay for food, but this is worthy for a locals investment also and the calories are worth skipping a few meals after (i finally had another snack 10 hours later is how full I was!). Outside dining is the way too go and service was friendly as well."

The lively crowd, the colorful decor and Jammin' Music created an Amazing atmosphere that made our experience here Super Duper Fun! We were seated on the patio and it made it just more romantic. We started off with the Kobe Sliders with a side of sweet potatoes fries and to top it off with the Frozen Hot Chocolate. The Sliders were not memorable and just plain average. The sweet potatoes fries was crispy and tasted sweet as potato pie. I would have to say this was the best part of the meal. Now on to the finale, the infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate. It came out melted and it reminded me of frozen chocolate shake. I was not impressed with the price ($14) or the taste! I think McDonald's chocolate shake will give Serendipity a run for their money. LOL j/k I think that is going a little overboard. To top it off the waiter was no where to be found. I guess you can say you are just paying for the ambiance and the experience of being here.

The Vegas one has a modern flavor to it, and you don't feel the charm of the place like you do in New York. Even going mid-afternoon on a Wednesday, my friends and I had to wait an hour. Once seated service was quick. The food is OK, nothing amazing. The desserts are large, but again they aren't the most amazing desserts on the planet. It's fun to visit, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."

This has been on my list for a while now, and each time I went to Vegas without trying this place out, made me want it even more the next. \n\nAnd it was perfect 100+ degree weather to try the much talked about frozen hot chocolate!! As soon as Phil V. and I found our friends inside, we downed our icy waters. It  was such a pain to find this place from the parking structure in back. Going thru the Casino..getting lost in the mall..asking workers how to get there and they didn't really know exact directions..and having to rush a bit under that heat. blech. just FYI, from ceasars parking structure, you head twds the right straight back twd the strip. \n\nSo the food was okay. The frozen hot choc was BOMB ($10). Consistency was perfect enough to eat with a spoon and drink thru a straw. I loved sippin up the chocolate shavings and spooning off the whipped cream. Too delicious. We shared the bbq chicken flat bread pizza. It was good, but not super filling. Although I like thin crust pizzas, this one had too much thin crust and not enough sauce and chicken to go around. My friend's crab cake salad was REALLY good. If I came back, I'd order this for myself. The side of sweet potato fries ($4) were a little bland, but still crispy-good. The size is not worth that price though.\n \nService was excellent, kept our waters refilled for that especially hot day and removed our plates right away. Ambiance was a mix of old school ice cream parlor shaken with a bit of new school Vegas. There was a huge bar inside and they played hiphop/club music. I'd love to come back next trip to try their other items. Huuuuge menu!"

The girlfriend and I decided to try this place out for lunch since it was convenient and also because they were participating in restaurant week during our stay. They offered a pre-fixed 3-course menu for around $30.10 each. This was a great deal but we always do such an awful job ordering and we always tend to over order 90% of the time. So we both went for the 3 course meal for lunch, and BTW 3-courses for lunch is ALWAYS overkill. But what the hell we were in Vegas.\n\nAppetizers:\nKobe Sliders - Nothing really special about the sliders just the usual run of the mill mini burger. It definitely wasn't the worst but it wasn't the best either.\nTropical Tuna Tacos - These tacos were a pleasant surprise! For some reason I was expecting some cooked tuna in a corn tortilla. But instead we got a pretty large portion of sliced raw tuna in a hard shell with mango salad on top. The flavor was amazing. The mango salad complimented the tuna wonderfully. This was probably my favorite dish of the afternoon.\n\nMain Course:\nSpaghetti and Meatballs - The meatballs in this dish were pretty delicious. Nice size and flavor. The sauce... not so much. The sauce tasted like it was from a can... =(. But if you are eating lunch at serendipity I would suggest on passing this dish because it is just way too much. I barely even touched half of the dish, the portion was humongous!\nThe Full Monty - Grilled All White Chicken Breast, Melted Monterrey Jack Cheese, Grilled Red Onion, Arugula, Bacon & BBQ Sauce on Ciabatta Bread. This was actually pretty damn good, a lot better than the spaghetti and meatballs. This was once again pretty large sandwich so order accordingly. Oh yeah, it also came with some sweet potato fries and those were nom nom nom. \n\nDessert:\nThis is where we made the mistake. With this menu we ended up with TWO Frozen Hot Chocolates! This is was wayyyy too much. In my opinion, one is good enough for two. So we barely even touched our second Frozen Hot Chocolate, we wanted to give it away but we had already taken a sip of it (I know we are creepy). We ended up getting the classic and the Oreo flavor. The OREO was way better than the classic. The classic seemed tasteless, but on the other hand the Oreo one was super sweet! To each his own. I wasn't too impressed by these \"Infamous\" frozen hot chocolates. \n\nThe service was great but the food was just average. If you are planning to eat here we sat on the patio and that added a nice touch to our lunch!"

The flatbread pizza and fries seemed like things I can get back home at a chain restaurant. The frozen hot chocolate was just like a cold icy blended chocolate drink. The food was forgettable, I was somewhat sober.\n\nThen I went there recently and got an oreo frozen hot chocolate to go. It was so good, I was somewhat drunk.\n\nYou're probably thinking that the change in opinions was due to intoxication but I had tried the frozen hot chocolate side by side next to the oreo version when we got it to go and still felt indifferent toward the original frozen hot chocolate. I mean it was good like how chocolate is good but it wasn't great. The oreo frozen hot chocolate was amazing. It really depends on your tastebuds because one of the girls tried the oreo frozen hot chocolate, thought it was too sweet, and liked the original frozen hot chocolate flavor better. \n\nMy opinion on the flatbread pizza and fries still stands. I would give them 4-5 stars on that oreo frozen hot chocolate alone but let's not be biased now. The surrounding patio is a chill atmosphere to choose to sit at if you're dining in on a warm sunny day."

This one felt dull and a bit on the rundown side to me. Our large table was lopsided and sloped to the left a bit, the pleather seats in the booth had small rips. \nMaking a 6:15 reservation and showing up 20 minutes early, we were happy to hear they still had our table for 8 available and the wait wouldn't be necessary. After being seated, and perusing the menus of salads, pizza, burgers, hot dogs, and of course a wide variety of ice cream sundaes on the back, we placed our order. \nWhile our drinks and food seemed to take an extraordinarily long time to arrive, I must say our server was quite nice. \nTheir bathrooms were out of order so we had to walk over to Caesars to wash our hands or use the facilities which I personally found annoying, as with younger children present, using the bathroom is about an every 20 minute necessity. The walk is a about 10 minutes each way. \nBasic children's menu items such as grilled cheese, Mac and cheese, hamburgers and teddy bear pancakes were ordered, the adults chose the Chinese Chicken Salad and grilled chicken sandwich.  Everything was just okay, nothing was outstanding (other than my daughter loved the grilled cheese). \nEach child ordered a smaller sundae, the vanilla ice cream with brownie and hot fudge was a hit, the chocolate ice cream with whip cream and rainbow sprinkles was said to be good. However, the famous frozen hot chocolate tasted like burnt plastic, not good at all! \nBill minus tip was $235, not ridiculous for a party of 8 on the strip. Would I return again? Only for a specific occasion as the poor food quality, inconvenience of parking, no bathroom in the restaurant and lack of whimsical ambiance was not impressive enough to bring me back anytime soon."

Great almond flavor.They are not cheap though, $11 & $14 dpding on size.   Decor great!  Very cute!!\n\nIce creams looked great but they were also $11+ up.  So just be aware.\n\nService, is probably 2/3 stars though.  But worth a visit."

I've been wanting to go to Serendipity's ever since I watched that movie Serendipity and that was circa ten years ago. Now that they have  a location in Vegas, my wish finally came true. \n\nThis pink/orange, girl decorated restaurant makes you feel like a little girl inside. It's decorated mostly white and pink with all these fancy plates that make you feel like you should have some tea and crumpets. Well, not all of the plates, just some of them. There was also a bar in the corner, and from the looks of it, it's a full bar? I never knew Serendipity's swung that way. \n\nAny way, luckily part of my group went there early to get us a table and they only waited 15 minutes. (If you don't want to wait, you can also order to go!) I expected it to be much longer but I'll settle with 15 minutes any day to come here. The place was packed and it took a while to get our orders in, aka the waitress took a while to get to us. A bunch of us hadn't eat all day (it was 4:30pm) and were ready to devour our own plates although the prices here are pretty hefty. I decided on the...\n\nSummer Bries. It's a sandwich, an open faced one (aka only one slice of Raisin Pumpernickel bread), with turkey, cranberry mayo, brie cheese (melted), and crunchy-fresh apples. Can I tell you something? It was DEEEE-LISH! :D It made me so full that I could barely get out of my sit (or maybe that's just me since I hadn't eaten all day). And it also came with a side of cheese potato chips that were quite cheesy.. seemed like parmesan cheese I believe. That $16 sandwich was well worth my money.\n\nAnd for dessert, well for the appetizer, a group of us shared the famous.. drum roll please... FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE! That sucker was so hot (not literally) that it was oozing out of the cup. Mmmm, whip cream, with a frothy, creamy, milk chocolate. It gave me some shivers, as well as a brain freeze. (I couldn't keep myself from drinking it all! Too bad I didn't have my own, because I would have devoured that sucker.)\n\nWhat a wonderful time we had, my frozen hot chocolate and sandwich, and me. My Serendipity wish finally came true and I'm so happy it did :D (Cue Happily Ever After Music)"

I have noted many sundaes at 'famous' ice cream shops do not have memorable ice cream, yet at Serendipity the toppings AND ice cream are delicious.\n\nThe restaurant fills up fast, as we had to wait 45 minutes for a table.

I have tried their classic sundaes and their very popular frrrozen hot chocolate. Yes, frozen and hot. I know...it's weird, but you just have to try it to understand it. It's a very interesting drink that tastes like cocoa in hot chocolate, but it's cold and consistent to a strawberry daiquiri. Very unique, indeed. The bartender who made our frozen hot chocolate was very friendly  which is always a plus. \n\nI think it's pretty convenient that they have a take out counter outside. The wait for getting a seat in the actual restaurant usually takes between 30 minutes to an hour, but there is plenty of seating in the surrounding areas to indulge in chocolatey goodness. With all the glitz and glamor of Vegas, this is a simple and fantastic dessert to have during your stay. i suggest coming early to beat the lunch rush. \n\n1 star off for having overpriced food and drinks"

No old guys still wearing Ed Hardy (or even worse trying to be cool with a blazer and jeans.... come on guys that is so 2002, put on some slacks.).  But know, Serendipity 3 is a Vegas attraction so be prepared to pay accordingly.\n\nTHE FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE - is amazing.  Absolutely amazing actually, it is no fluke that so many people enjoy it.  It is everything you imagine and more.  I compare it to an experience of eating a Jelly Bean and saying to yourself \"OMG this popcorn jelly bean does taste like popcorn\".  I'm not sure why I didn't expect the frozen hot chocolate to taste like well, frozen hot chocolate.... but it did.  This is a must try, repeatedly.\n\n2 FOR 1 MARGARITAS - OK, I'm not exactly sure what creative genius decided to pair dessert and margaritas but they did... and boy am I thankful.  For one the Margaritas are LARGE and in charge.  AND, yes there is more... they actually have liquor.  Most of the time there is so much of that limey mix and no tequila... not here, they give you your monies worth.\n\nBURGER - While I was last there I had the burger on the brioche bun,  Mmmmmm that bun was so buttery and delicious.

I've seen posts from friends of mine in social media of the Frozen Hot Chocolate, so I had to give this place a try!\n\nMy boyfriend and I went sightseeing mid-morning in Vegas, planning to go to Serendipity for brunch. But when we saw the long lines and were told that it would be a 45 minute to an hour wait, we decided to pass. My boyfriend suggested that we make a reservation for breakfast for the next day. So we made a reservation for 9:15am in the morning through the app OpenTable via the Serendipity website, for the same day about one hour before the restaurant opens. We went to the restaurant and no problem! They received our reservation.\n\nLuckily when we arrived there, it was not to busy (yet). We were deciding on what to order, and looked at what the other customers were having. One couple ordered and shared the Fried Chicken and Waffles, so my boyfriend and I followed suit and ordered the same thing. We also ordered one blueberry muffin, two coffees and Frozen Hot Chocolate.\n\nVerdict on the food and drinks:\n- Fried Chicken and Waffles: perfect for sharing for two! Comes with four bacon waffle triangles and fried chicken tenders, with home fried potatoes and maple syrup and honey mustard. Finger-lickin' good! It's the perfect balance and combination of sweet and savory; you get the sweetness from the maple syrup and waffles, and savory with the fried chicken tenders, home fried potatoes and honey mustard sauce. \n- Blueberry Muffin: tastes just like fresh blueberries! I thought it was too sweet, although it's really delicious! There are specks of sugar on top.\n- Frozen Hot Chocolate: we ordered the regular size, which was still enough for two, just a smaller portion. As long as we get the Frozen Hot Chocolate, I'm good! Delicious chocolate goodness! Not too sweet, as the whipped cream helped balance it out. Loved the chocolate shavings, which added some crunch. \n- Coffee: the biggest coffee cups I have ever seen (and been served)! I love that each of us got our own creamer cups, although we wouldn't need that much creamer.\n\nCustomer service is awesome! Our waiter was friendly and prompt, consistently checking on us and refilling our waters and coffee. The menu is a tad pricy, but the portions are huge. Parking wasn't a problem for us, as the hotel we were staying at is close by so we just walked it. I'm sure there are a lot of hotels that do valet and have self-parking."

            "review": "I have wanted to try their frozen hot chocolate ever since I saw the movie Serendipity with Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack. Yes, I saw that movie and you should too!\n\nMy friends and I came here for a late lunch after checking into our hotel. Since it was already 4pm and we had dinner reservations at 7:30pm we decided to order a few appetizers to share. Luckily we did to because the prices were ridiculous! I mean, $15.50 for grilled cheese? C'mon! \n\nAnyways.. back to the food. We ordered the tower of onion rings, buffalo wings, ahi tuna salad, and two frozen hot chocolate (for two) to share between the five of us. I loved the ahi tuna salad, the sauce was so good. The onions rings were cooked perfectly and didn't have all that oil and grease that you find at most places. I didn't have any of the buffalo wings because I have braces and didn't want to stain my clear bands (yes, I have braces, who hasn't?). The frozen hot chocolate was nice and cold and refreshing in the 100+ degree weather. I was a little disappointed though. I think all the hype made me expect it to be better but it was just okay for me. I was going to buy a mix of it to take home but after trying I passed. I'll drink it again if I come back here for another meal but I wouldn't buy some to take home.\n\nOverall, I liked the food here. It's definitely pricey for what it is, but they do have large portions. If you're willing to spend the money for the experience then definitely try this place. If you're not the type to spend a lot of money on food then by all means skip. But you'll be sorry you missed the experience!"

I did not bother to call ahead. The frills and decor felt like a cross between Willy Wonka and Alice in Wonderland. It was certainly festive and I'm sure kids would love it.  \nThe menu is very big.  Not necessarily because of choices. ... the font and layout are huge.  Of course we got the frozen hot chocolate (mother wanted one), it was good.  We should have stopped there. But no,  Mother wanted fried chicken. \nCrab cake sandwich?  Bad. \n Pizza? Bland. \nFoot long hot dogs?  (Had to ask server for our kraut)Meh\nMacaroni and cheese topped with chicken? Couldn't get past 4 bites.  Bland. \nFried chicken?  Pretty damn good.  Thank God.  We don't like to have mother angry!  \n\nOur server was S.L.O.W. and the place was NOT hopping. He dropped off the food and never came back.  Like never checked on refills, napkins, nada. Then he brought us our check, heard it was mother's 80th birthday, brought her a little dessert plate. Then we waited again. ...  I finally had to go to the register. The young lady at the register was registering for classes and never even made eye contact! ! \nSent us to our table. \n$280. Never again. If you HAVE to go, get the drinks they're famous for and that's it."

I ordered the frozen hot chocolate (~$10) and the chili cheese dog (~$16). Sure the portions are huge but the quality is mediocre. The frozen hot chocolate tastes exactly what the name sounds like, with a lot of whipped cream and chunky pieces of ice. The chili cheese dog was like 2 large hot dogs on a plate and it came with waffle fries. Nothing special. The only nice thing about that dish was the different condiments that it came with like sauerkraut, onions, mustard, and relish. To sum it up, this place was very disappointing and should be avoided!"

The cup size is way smaller than I had expected for an $11 drink. Perhaps you pay for the ambience and experience when you sit in the restaurant, but the to-go line is a definite no-go. The whipped cream is also coming out of a generic brand can, so it's also great knowing that you're paying for such fine quality.

(I didn't because that'd be horribly embarrassing, but I COULD have and that's what matters, right?...RIGHT?)\n\nWe got:\n\nChoose your own omelette (Spinach, Artichokes, Prosciutto, and Brie): Huge. Tasty, but I felt that it needed more flavoring so I added a lot of salt...I'm partly to blame though because I did choose all the ingredients myself haha. The side of breakfast potatoes was SO good, perfectly seasoned!\n\nLas Vegas Strip steak sandwich: MASSIVE. My boyfriend eats a LOT of food and he couldn't even finish it! He had to cut it in half. He says it was delicious though. \n\nCaesar Salad: Super good. I was really impressed. Not too much dressing, good portion, and the chicken was perfectly seasoned as well. \n\nSide of Berries: Good portion of berries for what you pay (strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries). It's a bit weird that it's garnished with limp green lettuce though.\n\nPeanut Butter Frrrrrozen Hot Chocolate: my favorite flavor of frrrozen hot chocolate. Not enough peanut butter this time around and, as mentioned earlier, not nearly as big as NY's.\n\nMimosas: Tasty, but standard fare. Served with a raspberry.\n\nOverall, very good experience. I will say though that since we were VIP we didn't have to wait, but they told us that the wait would have been around 45 minutes (at 11:45ish) if we weren't. Also, we had fantastic service, but the table next to us had to beg for a waitress to even come visit them once and they looked like they were getting progressively more and more \"over it\" as the meal went on (I would have too). So, moral of the story: be VIP wherever you go, I guess? Haha."

When I found out that they were opening one in Las Vegas, I really wanted to try it. So the next trip I took to Las Vegas, I wanted to make sure I went to Serendipity 3.\n\nMy boyfriend and I took a spontaneuos trip to Las Vegas sometime last August. We just got out of Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum and we walked towards Caesar's Palace where Serendipity 3 was. Yay!! When we arrived it was around lunchtime and it was very busy. We asked how long it would be to get a table. The hostess said about half an hour to 45 minutes. We didn't want to wait that long just to get their Frozen Hot Chocolate, so the hostess suggested that we order from their take out window, which was near by. So we ordered the dessert from the window and got our treat in a large take out cup. I was actually looking forward to getting it in their glass cup.. oh well. Took our first sip and it was yummy.\n\nThe next day, we came back to dine in. We weren't that hungry, but we wanted something small to eat, so we ordered their Safe at Home Kobe Beef Sliders. 4 small tiny burgers with American Cheese and a smear of Bacon Aioli on the plate. They're much smaller than your average slider and at $12 a plate, I don't think I'll be ordering that again if I decide to come back to Serendipity 3. We also ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate after, of course. The cup makes it look like you're getting a lot, but don't let it fool you. It's really not that much. But, boy did it look good. A mountain of whipped cream with chocolate shavings on top. A little bit expensive for hot chocolate blended with ice, but what can you do."

It ended up being grotesquely large and tasted awful. It was just pure fat and sugar with no flavor. We only ate less than half between the two of us but both got sick the rest of the day.

Whoa man!  I ordered the Las Vegas Strip Sandwich (pics 9 and 11).  10 ounces of prime medium rare NY Strip beef on a toasted French roll around 18 inches long; slathered with garlic butter, covered with three over easy eggs and six crisscrossed thick cut smoky, sweet, salty, crispy bacon.  BACON!!! \n\nLet's back up minute.  When we arrived at \"Trip S\" it was packed. The very nice hostess with the great smile sat us at the one of the two available seats.  Our Server, another lady with an easy manner and great smile, got us drinks immediately...well, within 2 minutes anyway and she followed up with us a few minutes later to let us know that our food was coming eminently.  I noticed other guests were signaling for her attention and she seemed to have a very good awareness of her area and appeared to notice the polite hand waving in her periphery without losing connection with us.  Once she was done with us, she moved on to the neighboring guests, flashed her award winning great smile and they were putty in her hands.  Actually, she had me at \"Hello\".\n\nThe food arrives!!!

If I were at home I would have thrown it on a plate, plop down on the couch, put on some football and gone to town, but being in coat and tie and in public that whole egg yolk dribbling down the chin would not fly so I did the right thing and cut it into thirds.  About a pound each I swear to goodness.  I took the first bite...how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways...It was almost as good a lingering first kiss.  Hot, salty, crunchy, savory, smoky, my ...WAIT! BACK THE TRUCK UP!!!!...that is not a good example of a great lingering first kiss, but just work with me.  The synchronization of flavors, textures, body responses, was almost overwhelming.  Yes, I was totally satisfied.  \n\nPlease note that this sandwich is not for the faint of heart.  You need to get your grub on to finish it but alas, that how I roll.  It's just one of those things you want to continue masticating until it's no more no matter how full the hypothalamus screams. \n\nBon appetite!"

By that I mean, perhaps you should dine in, have a full, meal, and then top off with one of the many desserts.\n\nI ordered my frozen hot chocolate to go, which could have been mistake number one, but I was not trying to stand in the heat for 35 minutes for a table when all I wanted was to try the frozen hot chocolate. \n\nI ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two and only waited about 5 minutes before a huge, frothy, behemoth of a frozen drink was placed in my hands. Here's the thing: it was delicious. It's far more spectacular than a Wendy's frosty (yes, I'm making the comparison... and you'll see why soon). A friend of a friend went once and complained that she paid $12 for a big frosty. Well, she's wrong on that count. At first taste, you can tell immediately that the chocolate is special. It's quality and it's generously used throughout. However, it's so quality that all I needed was a sip. The same went for my boyfriend. So, really, a \"for two\" should have been two shot glasses. It was THAT rich. \n\nI don't know if I'll ever order this again, I spent $20 for two sips and left the rest sitting at  Caesar's Palace slot machine for some hungry freegan to find their own \"jackpot\" but it was worth tasting."

Maybe it had something to do w/ sitting outside in 50 degree weather with a heat lamp next to us that didn't work.  \n\nLet's just say Leo, the best waiter ever, made everything better.  He recommended the hot chocolates.  Please do yourselves a favor and be sure to order the hot  chocolate.  It's aahhhmazing! \n\nAll three of us ordered the hangover omelets.  Let's just say Leo questioned what we did the night before.  The omelets came with french fries, bacon and mushrooms.  All INSIDE!! And a side of fries.  OMG! The omelets were just okay.  It ended up being a french fry omelet.  \n\nDefinitely the highlight was our hot chocolate and Leo.  If you go there and wonder if you see Leo.

I think this place is more known for their ice cream but we were passing by and saw their take out window menu and everything sounded pretty good so we gave it a try. Upon receiving and consuming our food, I can conclude that this place is overpriced. The food is pretty poor quality and poor tasting.  They will charge you for every little thing too.  We ordered a foot long hotdog to go and all the condiments were to go so knock the freshness component out and I asked if I could just have a small side of onions (I didn't think it was too much to ask) and the girl said I'm sorry you have to pay extra for that.  BUMMERS! The hot dog by the way was $10.  We also got a chili burger combo for    $14.  (I get it its Vegas, ripping tourists off is ok, but at least rip me off with better tasting food.) Plus, I wanted just a cup of water and the lady said no water and that she would have to charge me for a bottle of water.  Yikes! Probably would not come back again."

I sprung for the original frozen hot chocolate while my friends ordered an oreo and peanut butter one. It arrived to us overflowing, good thing there was a bowl at the bottom to make sure you got your money's worth ($11). The chocolatey medley with the whip cream and chocolate shavings made me go on quite the sugar high. So refreshing.\n\nI also ordered the Las Vegas dog. Complete with your choice of fries, sweet potato fries or coleslaw this dog was huge!! Topped with cheesy goodness and jalapeno pepper slices, I ended up tapping out with only devouring half of it. Sad face. I wish I had it now. Yums.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the wait wasn't too bad during the lunchtime rush. 20 to 30 minutes didn't seem so bad when I've waited longer for our local CPK restaurant (lame). When making the reservation I had to give my number to which they conveniently texted me to say our table was ready. Awesome."

The restaurant looks a little run down and we were sitting so close to the next table that I kept jamming my chair into the person's chair sitting behind me, but if you are looking for dessert on a hot Vegas day/night this is the place to go.

            "review": "TAKE AWAY:  The food and service here is mediocre; I heard the one in New York is better though.  There's usually a minimum of a 25 minute wait for a table (longer if it's busy).  People come here for the name and for their \"Frrrozen Hot Chocolate,\" which costs $15 (large).  If you're looking for a novelty restaurant or place where all the hype is at, this place is it.  But expect nothing more.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS / TIPS:  It's best to go during off-peak hours (i.e., afternoon).  Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is great to try (it does taste great), but it's difficult to justify the $15 price tag.  ALSO, they (supposedly) charge a $4 sharing fee.  We were able to avoid it because we purchased 3 Frrrozen Hot Chocolate (practically entr\u00e9e prices in and of itself).  Their sweet potato fries are good!\n\nDETAILS - DETAILS - DETAILS:\n-----------------------------------------------\nAtmosphere:\nIt's just one dining room and no waiting area; so if you're sitting next by the entrance, expect to feel the weather outside and perhaps someone standing over your shoulders as you eat.  The best way to describe the d\u00e9cor is: wacky, eccentric, random, and maybe even a little bit nostalgic as they try to bring in some of that old-fashioned diner feel.\n\nService:\nThe wait here can be long at times.  Even during off-peak hours (e.g., 3:00pm) the wait can be 15 minutes for a party of 2-4 and 30 minutes for 5-8.  Service began slow (waited 10 minutes for our order to be taken), but picked up after our order was submitted.  On an irritated note, our waitress tried to nickel and dime us with three $4 sharing fees (we ordered 5 entr\u00e9es for 8 people), then claimed that she was being nice because she was supposed to charge the $4 sharing fee for all 8 of us (yes, making that $32; is she out of her mind??).  After we exuded our frustration with the matter and indicated that we had ordered 3 of their $15 Frrrozen Hot Chocolates, she decided to be nice and \"take care it.\"  C'mon lady... we weren't born yesterday.\n\nFood Quality / Selection:\nThe food here is mediocre.  Their burger is big, but nothing spectacular.  We also had a sirloin steak sandwich on a large baguette.  Overall, the portions are on the bigger side and you're sure to get filled because most of the food they serve are heavy.  Presentation is average as well.  Take a look at their menu here: http://www.serendipity3.com/food.htm. \n\nPricing/Value/Convenience:\nOverall, I would say that this restaurant has poor value given the price they charge for the quality of the food, the type of food they serve, their overall service, and the crowded (almost cafeteria/fast food-like) atmosphere.  It's okay if you're here just to check it out, but I could recommend many better restaurants to go to.  It's centrally located right on the Strip, so just valet your car at Caesar's Palace and walk on over!"

Zwischen dem Hotel und dem Serendipity die Wasserspiele und Springbrunnen, die von der Au\u00dfenterrasse wunderbar zu beobachten (und fotografieren) sind. Und zur anderen Seite das pulsierende Leben des Strip.\n (Siehe Foto unten) Gehobenes Burger Restaurant \n so kann man das Serendipity am besten beschreiben. Obwohl  es gibt nicht nur Burger, die gro\u00dfe Menukarte ist umfangreich und bietet auch jede Menge Pizzen, Omelets und andere Eiergerichte, dazu verf\u00fchrerische, gro\u00dfe Desserts  Eis, Cremes und sonstige Naschereien.\nIm Innenraum sind die Tische sehr eng gestellt, zu Essenszeiten ist es meist gerammelt voll und Gespr\u00e4chsf\u00fchrung kaum noch m\u00f6glich. Sch\u00f6ner ist es da schon auf der Au\u00dfenterrasse. Der Blick auf den direkt vor einem liegenden Strip ist lebendiges Kino. Und mit einem guten Teleobjektiv lassen sich von hier aus unbemerkt die kuriosesten Fotos schie\u00dfen. \nF\u00fcr Las Vegas Verh\u00e4ltnisse l\u00e4sst es sich preislich vern\u00fcnftig essen. Wir waren mehrfach hier und haben  nat\u00fcrlich, wenn schon dann schon  Burger getestet: A.B.C. Burger ($ 16+), BBQ & Blue Burger ($ 16+), B.E.C. Burger ($ 17+), aber auch ein Omelet East West ($ 14+). Wir bestellten die Burger medium rare und erfuhren, dass dies hier pink genant wird. Die aus S\u00fc\u00dfkartoffeln hergestellten Pommes gibt es zum Burger dazu und schmecken vorz\u00fcglich. Soft Drinks hei\u00dfen in den Staaten Sodas (Cokes, Fantas etc.) kosten $ 4. Und den Pott Kaffee bekommt man f\u00fcr $ 4, freies Nachschenken inklusive.\nZu Spitzenzeiten ist das Restaurant sehr gut besucht und man muss Wartezeiten bis zu 45 Minuten hinnehmen. Die Bedienung wie immer freundlich, aber bei vollem Lokal \u00fcberfordert. H\u00e4ufiges Warten ist leider angesagt, auf die Bestellannahme, auf die Lieferung des Bestellten und auch auf die Rechnung, die doch sonst in den Staaten immer so schnell auf den Tisch gelegt wird. \nFazit: Zentral gelegene, preislich vern\u00fcnftige Futterstelle. Wer Zeit mitbringt und diese Art K\u00fcche mag, der wird zufrieden sein. Gratis gibt es von der Terrasse das Las Vegas Spektakel. Gute drei Sterne."

The wait is long so if you can sit at the bar, it's way faster.\n\nI got the fried eggs benedict.  The dredge the poached eggs in corn meal and fry them.  It's a cool idea, but I like my egg yolks runny.  Instead of a muffin they used a biscuit with hammed up country gravy as a plate base while still topping with the hollandaise sauce.\n\nThis thing was very good, but it was a damned gut bomb.  I wished I was drunk before I ate it to fulfill the drunk munchies.\n\nThe gf got their french toast log.  It comes with bacon, eggs, seasoned potatoes, fresh berried and cream and syrup.  Freaking crap! They weren't kidding when the named it a log.  This thing is basically a small loaf of bread with the crust cut off.  I'm assuming they do a typical soak, except after the soak they crust up the outside in corn flakes.  The corn flakes make for a nice different texture to the soft spongy interior of the log.  The seasoned potatoes were really good, eggs not so much, bacon unknown as I didn't have any.  I would have liked the bread to be soaked a little longer, but then that might have put the integrity of the log shape in jeopardy.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate for the price is not worth it, which is why I didn't get any.  Go to William Sonoma and buy some packages yourself and make it at home.  I only assume the were good since the two rude Texan couples that sat next to us, one couple on each side and yelling over us to chat with each other, as they were there for the shit kicker convention, enjoyed the frozen hot cocolate\n\nThree stars, food was surprisingly good for what we got, slightly higher priced, but what do you except from a place like this?"

Oh and the fire alarm went off, cool.\n\nThis will make me sound like an old lady - but it was realllly loud inside and food service was slow.\n\nOver all yummy eats, but an over hyped experience. Prices were really reasonable and my $10 bloody mary was big, spicy and super delicious."

I had the priviledge of going on an early bday trip to Las Vegas from the weekend of March 25-March27/2011 with awesome friends of  mine.  Anyways, this one was my best friend's sister's idea that we must go visit.  She had reserved a table since earlyyyyy morning on Saturday, March/26/2011 in order for us to be seated around 9:45pm, but the table was slightly late for us.....LOL.  The waitresses didn't make the table on time for us.  I'm not complaining because my bff's sister ordered us the Frozen Iced Chocolate drink that was their main specialty for us three to share.....I tried it while having their Serendipity House Coffee with Nutmeg which made it extremelyyyy too strong LOL....I'm still not complaining because this house coffee kept me awake throughout several hours into the nite/morning so that I could enjoy Harrah's hotel where we stayed at some more before checking out time at 11am on Sunday, March/27th...."

I was here with two other people a couple weeks ago and wanted to sit outside on the patio, and there was a sign that said to check in with the hostess inside. When we found the hostess, she said that we need to check with the bartender outside. So we did, and the one person who was there sort of waved us to find our own seats. Then, for the next 20 minutes...\n\nNo one came to greet us or take our orders. We had to fish one menu that was sitting on the counter. There was one guy behind the counter, but he refused to look up or talk to anyone and just cleaned the counter in circles. \n\nI flagged down three waiters, who said that they can't do anything other than bus tables and get food from the kitchen. One of them said that we need to talk to the bartender, but the bartender was leaving so we need to wait until the next bartender comes. When the guy did come, there was more silent treatment, yay! I literally stood in front of the counter for a good five minutes and tried to talk to him, but the whole time he would just buzz around the place without looking up whatsoever. Then he finally did and said \"Just a sec\" but then continued to hover silently doing who knows what. Meanwhile, the waiters/bussers were still helpless and continued to mill around bringing out orders that I had no idea how they were placed. \n\nWe left. Obviously. What a great experience!"

The aioli added a nice touch but the sliders didn't look hugely appetizing since they were composed of just a meat patty plus a slice of cheese. At least throw in a pickle! I tried their sweet potato fries which were just okay as well as their standard burger which was pretty flavorless. Get the steak fries though. They are surprisingly good, nicely battered and crunchy. I picked up a frozen hot chocolate at their take-out window and didn't realize the thing was $10 until the cashier rang me up. I would say try the frozen hot chocolate once but it's really not worth it after that. It has a nice thick chocolaty consistency to it and is topped with lots of whipped cream (mmmmm) but thank god I was sharing it because I couldn't drink more than half."

My boyfriend enjoyed the meaty burger he had and I think the other two guys in our party the first time we were here also enjoyed their meals.  \n\nMy friends and I came here for lunch one day and we all tasted the frozen hot chocolate.  We thought it was, okay.  Sweet, but nothing to gush over. On this visit I ordered the ABC burger: $16.50. Avocado, brie, and carmelized onions.  I probably should have shared this with someone.  It's rather large and rich in taste, mental note next time.  My boyfriend also ordered a strawberry milkshake ---- YUMMM!! WAYY better than the frozen hot chocolate.  \n\nThe second time I visited here was for a bachelorette breakfast with a bunch of girlies and the lovely bride to be.  We each ordered a plate and all shared, family style.  I ordered the Mochaccino which was AWESOME! It really was =) I loved every sip I took.  So here are our orders.  \nThe Hangover Omelet\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=vteEs7yUA18QfdMuHFjP9g\nMy cornbeef hash and eggs (got them over easy instead of scrambled) \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=XUTiFcklRbx1W5YJ-CnFpA\nThe Holy Huevos rancheros\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=tmxhnrQ-bbkv4apMVIGGHw\nThe balsamic & strawberry waffles\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=p7k9EmZxXuqEovZ7O3SnIg\nThe fried eggs benedict with sausage gravy\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=moYp8upto_W8OEzeXIxzvg\n\nThat last one I'll definitely order again, it was so delicious!! I loved my corn beef hash, but bendicts are my fave, throw in sausage gravy, and you got me in lust!  Eating family style allowed us to taste every dish, and they were all great.  The balsamic & strawberry was different, you wouldn't think that this pairing would work, but it went well together harmoniously.  The hangover omelet was also delicious, fries in anything is GOOD!  Holy Huevos Rancheros was a nice presentation, but I have a thing for eggs in the morning, so I'd probably order that at lunch next time.  \n\nService both times were great.  The hostess was sweet & professional when I made both reservations and though the waiter took kind of awhile on our second visit both waiters both times were friendly, nice and did their best to get our food out in a timely manner.  I'm looking forward to having breakfast here again the next time we go to vegas and I already know what I'm going to order =)\n\nYelp 365 Challenge: 83/365 \"Las Vegas Breakfast\""

I had the Hangover Omelet which was filled with way too much cheese, overly-salted home fries, tough bacon, and mushrooms. One of the dishes, a simple pancake/egg/bacon plate, came out cold and took over 15 minutes to come back out because they remade the entire thing. By the time it came out the person who ordered it had already eaten off of everyone else's plate and no longer wanted the plate. Our waitress was hard to find and we had to go up to the hostess stand multiple times to get service. Didn't try the frozen hot chocolate or anything else, but for breakfast steer clear."

            "review": "Heard the frozen hot chocolate hype so had to try one with half oreo and half mochaccino flavors.  It tasted like chocolate ice milk with whip cream and a couple coffee bean candies and some crushed oreos on top ... which is fine.... but to me the atmosphere ruined the whole experience.  The tables seemed too close together and small ... at least where we were seated (directly across from the kitchen).  It also seemed a bit on the dirty side.  There was such an overwhelming scent of ketchup in the air, it ruined my desire for anything chocolatey.  Also, I wanted to wash my hands before eating and had to go outside of the restaurant, pass the patio area, and down some cavernous cement hallway to use a restroom.  I was expecting an elegant, old-timer ice cream parlor feel, but this place is no where near that. I can't imagine buying the $1000 sundae here. There were a bunch of teens hanging around a cash register by the door which was confusing because the waiter who just left the check didn't specify if he was going to take the payment or if we were to pay at the cash register by the door.  Sooo after waiting around awhile, we stood by the cash register while they asked us what our waiter looked like and then gave the payment to him.  No eye contact, \"thanks\", \"come back again\" from the waiter...so we just walked out. Overall I felt like I was just at a fast food place, but with exorbitant prices, grumpy waiters, & pretty plates."

I ate all the fries and hardly any of my sandwich they were that good. We also got the amazing Frozen Hot Chocolate, and it's just as good as the one in NYC. I kind of wish it had more of the Serendipity feel to it as the one in NYC does, like how they have some of the most random things on the walls. It makes it interesting and gives it character. This one has more of a diner feel to it. I can't wait to get back to Vegas because this place is my must-visit every time I'm there!"

I say beside Caesar's Palace because it is on the same property as the resort but is located right on the strip. The service here has always been friendly and warm.\n\nI have met several servers and each time I have gone back, and if they're working, they remember me. This is amazing as many thousands of people go through weekly. If the manager is there, she'll come around and say hi and be sure the meal or drinks are what you're expecting. The temperature on the food is always hot. This is difficult for large kitchens at any restaurant but they seem to pull it off.\n\nI have brought in many sets of friends, recommended it to people on social services and all of them have had an excellent time. How do I know this you may ask. They send me tweets or Facebook status wall postings about their experiences. I took my parents here during one of their trips to visit and they both thoroughly enjoyed their lunch, they have asked to go back.\n\nI have had many desserts here, including the Golden Opulence Sundae, which was presented to me, without my prior knowledge, when I hit a certain follower count on Twitter. Sharing it with the 20+ other people at the party was a good time. They brought it out in a Baccarat Crystal bowl with a golden spoon via white gloved private butler. The almonds were covered in golf leaf and there were giant chocolate pieces all over it. People ask if the taste of the Sundae is worth the price. First, you get to keep the golden spoon and the crystal bowl, so half of the price of the dessert is just in those two items. Secondly, you shouldn't have this dessert by yourself. You could end up spending several thousand dollars on bottle service at a club, this is more fun. The taste is unlike anything I've ever had in a Sundae. There are some exotic ingredients in this sundae that I have yet to taste in another deluxe sundae. Some of the food I have received at this restaurant have been comped. In no way has any of the staff asked me to review this restaurant. I did not keep the bowl or the spoon, those were returned to the restaurant."

The flavors other than chocolate DO NOT have chocolate in them. Thus the amaretto version is really just almond flavor and not chocolate. If you want mixed flavors, let them know.\n\nNow onto the experience. The restaurant is a pink and white diner with lots of cookie artwork on the wall and checkerboard tables. Our group of 5 ordered 2 of the frozen hot chocolates for 2. I sampled the amaretto one, which was pretty good. The size of the dual cup seems large as they top it with a lot of whipped cream, but I would say the cup is not much more than 20 ounces, which is unfortunate for the whopping $15 they charge for the cup.\n\nIn terms of food, I tried their chicken wings and fries. Their steak fries were pretty good, with good seasoning. Their chicken wings--HIGHLY recommend them! They were nice and spicy, and their was a light honey taste underneath that seemed to come from a primary marinade before they are deep fried. These were also the juicy kind of chicken wing filled with meat.\n\nOverall, the dining experience is good, but since the frozen hot chocolate is the draw, I'd say be careful of having too high of expectations. It's a glorified milkshake. Some of the sundaes also looked really good, and may be of more \"substantive\" value. I still may be back for the wings :P"

Their was no sign that said wait to be seated and nobody was at the counter. So we sat our selfs then one of the old Caucasian waitresses walked up to us and said we had to get up and wait to be seated very rudely. She didn't even greet us. She also said that this section was closed off. There were also no signs that said area was closed and we actually were sitting next to a few other groups of people that were seated. So I don't see how a section could be closed off if there were multiple tables filled around us and nothing saying otherwise. So we get up and go to the counter the Caucasian hostess with black hair walks up and a male co-worker does too and starts talking to her mean while there is like 3 other groups waiting in line now and we are in the front. She talks to him for a few minutes about stuff that isn't even work related. About 5 minutes into it I had to interrupt them since they were not paying attention to the growing line. I noticed both of them glanced at us and continued to talk. This to me appears very rude. I think they don't like young mixed couples and the way we dressed are something. Its not like they had to prep any tables because they all were all already clean and waiting for people to use them. Then they sat us furthest in the back from everyone which appeared very racial in my opinion. I think we were the only minorities. I would not go back to this place. The food was decent nothing amazing. The prices high vs the quality of the food. I expect better service from the strip and Caesars. If I could I wouldn't even give them a star on service alone. Oh ya there was allot of people that worked there standing around too. They need to train there workers better they appear lazy and unmotivated. This whole time we were never even greeted."

But guaranteed, you will get your money's worth.\nWe ordered the croissant egg breakfast sandwich and the corner beef and eggs.  Our food came in about 15-20 min so that was good.  My sandwich was perfect, the croissant was a good size and stuffed with gooey cheese eggs and bacon.  After 1 bite I was in love.  The corned beef was some of the best I've had.  Was not greasy at all and great flavor to it. \nWe were in Vegas for 3 days and went there 3 times to eat.  On the last night we ate there I ordered a huge steak bacon and eggs sandwich on a full sized French baguette.  It was fucking incredible.  The steak had great flavor and everything just tasted so good and handcrafted.  This place was worth every penny and next time I'm in Vegas I'll definitely go there again."

Saturday night in Vegas, what good restaurant wouldn't be packed at 7pm? Once seated my boyfriend and I decided to order from their monster meal deal menu. Basically, they have a list of appetizers and entrees that you can choose from for $20. He ordered the spaghetti and kobe beef sliders for both of us. When the food came out, we noticed that only one order was brought out. The waiter had misunderstood and thought we wanted one order to share. Even though it was our fault, he gave us a free frozen hot chocolate for two for having to wait!!\n\n- The Kobe Beef Sliders were deeelicious. The sauce that they have inside of the sliders and on the place is perfect. It added the right amount of flavor to an already flavorful patty.\n\n- The spaghetti was very flavorful. The monster meatballs were a PERFECT combination of veal, pork, and beef (the meat lover's dream!). They were extremely flavorful. The noodles were thicker than most spaghetti noodles, but cooked perfectly making the dish very filling.\n\n- The frozen hot chocolate is definitely a must try. The frozen chocolatey goodness was topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. We ate/drank the whole thing!\n\n- The root beer! The root beer was different from most root beers I've had at restaurants. It was very soft and had a slight creamy taste to it. It was very good.\n\nI would definitely come back here again to eat, but I would make a reservation next time I plan on doing so."

The price is a bit steep, yes...but the same goes for the rest of Vegas so I don't really have any complaints. I'm not nuts about the food. It's decent enough and if I was rating this place on food more than dessert, it'd probably score a 3. \n\nI think it's pretty convenient that they have a take out counter outside. The wait for getting a seat in the actual restaurant usually takes between 30 minutes to an hour, but there is plenty of seating in the surrounding areas to indulge in chocolatey goodness. With all the glitz and glamor of Vegas, this is a simple and fantastic dessert to have during your stay."

The food was okayy...kind of disappointed because this place was so hyped up and sounded like a \"must-try\" in Vegas.  \n\nHad a chance to try the Kobe Beef Sliders, Hot Dog, Clam Chowder soup, Frozen Hot Chocolate (which is the supposedly the \"best\" thing everrrr -.- ) BBQ Chicken pizza, Hangover (omlette) and sweet potato fries.  The food tasted like it should.  Nothing special besides the fact that the prices were doubled than what they should cost and the portions were messed around with.  The sliders were really cute and small but not worth the 9 because the \"kobe\" patties they used tasted like any other patty.  The guacamole for the hot dog was good but the hot dog was just a hot dog except it was longer.  Basically, everything was just average. Dont get worked up on the hypeeee!!!\n\nOverall, I'd say come here for the atmosphere.  The ambience is nice, the design of the restaurant is cute and I wanna say..girly...The service is friendly. The frozen hot chocolate is appealing to the eyes but it just tastes like a little melted down chocolate shake. Everything else was pretty mediocre. Probably won't come back unless its hot out and my friends want to share an expensive chocolate shake. Another disappointing thing was that the clam chowder and sweet potato fries came out lukewarm, not hot at all.  Don't know if it was because it was a cold day or what, just a bit bummed the chowder was cold, but its not bad. \n\n\ncheck out my pictures :)"

My husband and I came here the last time we were in Vegas. They have a breakfast and lunch menu. I ordered the original Frrrozen Hot Chocolate at $12 and my husband ordered the Thai Beef Salad at $18. The Thai Beef Salad is made up of Marinated skirt steak, iceberg, Napa cabbage, cilantro, jalapenos, tomato, Asian pickle, Thai sesame dressing, nestled in a coconut shell.\n\nOverall, our bill came out to over $30 for a frozen hot chocolate and a salad. To be quite honest, the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate was a total let down. It didn't really have a rich chocolate burst of flavor nor did it have a nice icy or creamy consistency. The consistency was actually kind of chalky/powdery.\nThe Thai Beef salad was decent and had good flavors, but the portion wasn't that big and it was quite pricey to top it off. The service was just okay.\n\nAt least I can say I've been here and tried it. But the Chocolate Blast a Baskin Robins is so much better in comparison (which is kind of sad). \n\nAnyway, I don't think I'll ever return.\n\n167/100 Reviews for 2014"

The frozen hot chocolate is a must, but definitely share it because it is large and very rich. I think it's enough for 3 people! When I went for lunch, I got the crab cake sandwich and it was really good. Big portion too, I ended up eating all the crab cake but leaving about 1/3 of the bun. It also comes with bacon which adds a nice crunch to each bite. With a side of sweet potato fries (they had something on them that made them slightly sweet--brown sugar maybe? it really took it up a notch though), a very filling and satisfying meal. I also had a bite of my friend's prosciutto pizza and that was also really good. I've been to other places that specialize in dessert and their food items aren't so good, but not so with this place. Both the food and dessert are yummy! Definitely worth a try, especially considering it's so impossible to get a seat at the NYC location!"

Bad thing, you don't get your frozen hot chocolate in the pretty glass cup unless you dine-in.  \n\nI ordered the regular sized frozen hot chocolate and initially thought to myself \"$8.25!? This better be some good ish!\" Once sip of the stuff and I was hooked! I regret not having more of it before I left Vegas because ever since I've been back in LA I've been having FHC withdrawals!

And that was the only prompt thing about that experience.  About 20-30 minutes later our frozen hot chocolates arrive.  Still waiting for our drinks though.  The frozen hot chocolates were good, but not the best thing I've ever had.  \n\nAbout an hour later we're still waiting for our food.  I had to flag down our waitress and ask her what's up.  She said it was taking long because we ordered our burgers well done! Yea, cuz that takes an extra 45 minutes on the grill!  When the food finally comes out I remember some of the food being good, but some of it being gross and cold.  I ordered a chili dog.  Avoid that at all costs.  My bro ordered a pizza, it was gross and soggy.  The burgers and sandwiches were all good though.  All of our food came out at diffeent times, we were still waiting on drinks, and some of the food was cold!!\n\nI was so upset by the service that I went to complain to the manager.  She seemed understanding and said she would \"take care of it.\"  Honestly, I thought she was gonna knock off 20% or something.  Then our server, mad, comes by our table and throws our check on the table.  Nothing was changed on the bill.  I told her that the mamager said she was going modify our check, and she rudely told us no.  So, this time, furious, I go directly again to the mamanger and tell her what just happened.  I think she felt bad becuase I had previously complained and she said the entire bill was on the house. Wow, I really wasn't expecting that, especially for a bill of about 7-8 people.  So an extra star for the manager being understanding and the forzen hot chcoclate.  Other than that, I dont think I'll return."

If not for the visual oomph, the food is quite good here and the several times I have had the opportunity to visit have been great.  I do recommend making reservations when busy times are being targeted (brunch, lunch, dinner) otherwise you are looking at an hour wait.  Service has always been prompt and our waters topped off without having to ask.\n\nLast but not least, remember to order their infamous Frozen hot chocolate.  If you have never sampled it, do it.

I ordered the Chicken Ranch Salad. According to the description, it comes with cucumbers, corn, cherry tomatoes and grilled chicken. I literally could count the number of corn kernels in my salad. It came with 3 slices of cucumber and 4 halves of cherry tomatoes (only 2 whole cherry tomatoes!???). Couldn't count the amount of lettuce tho, because it came with so damn much. In addition, I took a big bite of appropriate proportion of greens-to chicken- to cucumber ratio.. And a big \"CRACK.\" A damn bone with the chicken. \nI will say the romaine lettuce was fresh and crispy & the chicken was seasoned well. However, for the price and quality... Not worth it. Not to mention that their tap water is 1.08$. I had to ask twice because I didn't understand why there was a charge for some tap water!! I will try their infamous frozen hot chocolate one day... Or maybe not."

Service was terrible. Started off by announcing a $25/per person minimum order- and said that if you ordered less than that you would be charged a fee. I thought this was ridiculous as one of our older family members did not want to eat but the waitress said she would charge her $25 no matter what. I ordered the nachos (super mediocre at best), the crab and artichoke dip (which tasted spoiled and almost made me sick) and the original frozen hot chocolate (which was good, but not worth the price... Max brenner has much better chocolate drinks). \n\nWhen my server finally returned, I immediately sent back my rancid dip, and she offered a replacement entree, so I ordered a hot dog thinking it would come out quickly. After 30 min I still had not received my food, at which point everyone was done eating even their dessert! The waitress again never followed up, so I asked for them to cancel my food completely. \n\nWe waited another 15 minutes for the check to discover we were slapped with an auto gratuity (which she did NOT mention) despite the menu clearly saying there are NO AUTOGRATs. \n\nI asked for the manager and gave her the rundown on our disastrous meal. She offered to discount the bill, but then returned the bill to me with no discount. Another 20 min ordeal and she have us 20%.... Hardly worth it. \n\nI would NEVER advise anyone to go here and will not go back ever again. If I could leave negative stars I would."

There were four of us so we decided to split two regular sized (which was more than enough) Frrrozen Hot Chocolates, one Almond Amaretto and one classic Chocolate. I'm not usually a fan of overly sweet drinks, especially hot chocolate but I was pleasantly surprised by the Almond Amaretto flavored one. It had a frappuccino texture and it wasn't overly sweet, but it was missing the flavor of amaretto. The classic chocolate, as I imagined, wasn't my favorite but still yummy. Definitely a great place for dessert, but warning, the portions are huge, so bring a big group!"

Our group of 4 guys arrived around noon for...brunch I guess. At least it was brunch time. There wasn't a wait for a table even though we wanted to be seated inside. We were ready to order pretty quickly, but it took our waitress quite a long while to collect our drink order (which was 3 waters and a coffee). Once we finally ordered, two of us settled on Omelets and two went with sandwiches. Then the wait began again.\n \nAbout 20 minutes later, the food finally arrived. The omelets were normal size, but very plain. The omelet was very dry, as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while (trust me, it was Vegas in July, I knew the feeling of sitting under a heat lamp).\n \nMy cup of fruit was not quite a full measuring cup size, but it did have fresh berries and melons, which was nice. I'm told the sandwiches were quite good and obnoxiously large. One friend ordered the steak and eggs which turned out to be about a pound of steak, an 18\" hoagie, 3 fried eggs, and bacon.\n \nWhen we finished our meal, we looked around for the waitress. Then we waited. Then we waited. Then we waited. Then we waited. You get the point. Then she finally came and told us she would bring the check. Then we waited. Then we waited. Finally we got the check and continued in our waiting pattern for her to come back for our cards, run them, and bring our cards back.\n \nFor all future Vegas trips, I intend to skip this place unless I'm looking to eat a mediocre, overpriced 30 minute meal that is leisurely crammed into 90 minutes. Normally this would be a 1 star review, but my fiends enjoyed their sandwiches at least so I'm being generous."

I convinced my mom that we should get it that it would be worth the calories! \n\nWell. The cake was actually pretty bad. My mom eats almost anything and even she didn't want to eat it. It wasn't fresh and wasn't even good. How do you mess up bday cake and ice cream!!! And it was expensive. \nWe were told the hotel next door bakes everything and serendipity staff just assemble the desserts, so it should be fresh, well I don't know what to say but it was awful. The whipped cream was stale too.. ._.\n\nAlso another awful anecdote to add to our awful bday cake, our server with this fake saccharine smile rubbed me the wrong way. She asked us if there was \"anything else we needed\" 7 times while we were there. You know that was a hint for us to leave. Why else would someone approach you that many times. What could we possibly need except you leaving us alone!! What a bad experience. And we only sat for about an hour. Dinner folks hadn't even arrived, we looked around to make sure we weren't being selfish and hogging a booth for one nasty slice of bday cake... But no, a lot of booths were open... Bizarre experience I don't think I will return even just to try something else when I go back to Vegas \n\nI'm giving 2 stars bc I liked the concept of the place even though i didn't enjoy myself here"

We found out we could sit at the bar, so of course we did.  First off, peanut butter frozen hot chocolate...amazing. (and seems simple to make at home)  now the fun stuff, the bartender was arrogant and a jackass.  We also had the nachos...awful.  They tasted like they were made with roasted plastic, the chips were oily and overall a bad choice.  I should have gotten the steak sandwich or the pizza like my neighbors, looked great. I say go, but don't look beyond the desserts."

I ordered a chilli cheese hot dog, ehh, i think it is something anyone can make and the chilli was not even that good.  The bread was good though, tasted like it was freshly baked and had that lightly toasted texture.  \n\nOrdered a giant breakfast after a night of drinking- everything should taste good right?  But I felt it was just average for a pricey breakfast.  \n\nBasically nothing special about their food, but they are big portions and can be shared with 2 people.  So, in a way you are paying for what you get- half the price for half the taste quality.\n\nAlso tried the original frozen hot chocolate-it's good, no doubt, but for $11, I can make this or get it cheaper elsewhere.  Sounds fancy, but really it's just a frozen chocolate drink! That's it!  \n\nTried the frozen green tea hot chocolate-bad idea!  Too sweet and tastes nothing like green tea.  Artificial.  Overpriced.  Nothing special."

It's exactly the kind if place that I would normally despise. However, I'll admit, Serendipity 3 was my favorite part of my recent trip to Vegas. \n\nThe food was very good. We split a flat bread pizza and a Marshmallow Grasshopper Hot Fudge Sundae and they were both delicious. The staff was friendly and our server was professional and clearly knew the menu like the back of his hand. \n\nThe atmosphere is really unique. While everything else on the strip tries to out high-end-hipster-cool everything else, Serendipity 3 is a true departure.  It feels like a Fantasy Land tea party with footlong hotdogs and great ice cream (trust me, I meant that in a good way). We will definitely go back."

Definitely a must try every time you're in Vegas!\n\nOn the contrary, some friends of mine decided to try a banana split. The regular is big enough for 2-3 people but is personally too sweet.

            "review": "First, let me say that most reviews that express complaints about the restaurant are spot on. Although I read the reviews, I wanted to try it simply because of the desserts, and I now wish I would have just picked them up at the outside service after a meal elsewhere. Aside from the desserts that you can get to-go, the only saving grace of Serendipity is their location since it is literally on LVBD. \n\nWith this being my first review, I would have given Serendipity a 2 star rating in my own head until I saw that to YELP, 2 stars means that I have just \"experienced better.\" The fact of the matter is, I HAVE YET TO EXPERIENCE WORSE. \n\nTo start the night, my date and I walked to the front to check in for our reservation. The girls did not seem to understand what a reservation was, and it took me a minute to explain to them that I actually called ahead. They then proceeded to tell me that I was better waiting for my reservation than an actual table because it would be sooner. This really showed that they didn't understand I was just letting them know I was there.\n\nOnce seated, our waitress came promptly and asked what we would like to drink. She brought our drinks back right away, so I thought the night would turn out quite well. This prompt service set my expectations too high.\n\nFor the next ten minutes, she would come by every two minutes or so, interrupt our conversation, and say \"are you ready yet?\" and \"how about now?\" PEOPLE DO LIKE TO TALK WHILE AT DINNER AND SHOULD NOT BE RUSHED.\n\nEven if we sat right down and looked right at the menu, it would take at least twenty minutes to fully look over the menu because it is so chaotic. Before heading to the restaurant, please take a glance at the menu on their website before going. \n\nThe food that came out was very bland and mine was overcooked (burnt, rather). My date didn't seem to like her meal much either, but then again, most people don't openly complain on first dates. \n\nSince the food made us both \"full\" rather quickly, and we heard that we needed to try the desserts for sure, we looked for our waitress so we could order and she was nowhere to be found. So basically, she couldn't wait to take the initial order, and then didn't want to help at all. \n\nFinally after asking another waitress for an order of dessert, we were given the first good piece of the meal all night. Their dessert selection is rather large and quite nice, which is why I initially recommended take it out from the side store that they have. \n\nOn Scale of 1-5...\nService: 2 (only because we received our drinks quickly)\nAppetizers/Entrees: 1\nLocation: 4\nOrganization/Decor: 1\nPrice: 2 - I have no problem paying for a good meal and spending a lot, but this was not even close to good. \nFriendliness: 1\n\nOverall, the most important categories to me got a 1, so it is just a 1 in my book.\n\n\nMy point is simple, I will never return for the full dining experience and you should never try it."

The first time we split the onion ring tower and the black and blue burger. Both were really good. It was a lot of food, we still had onion rings left over, and I put them in a box and was determined to give to the next homeless person I saw, but I chickened out.\n\nSecond time we went we had to wait a little longer, but we had the frozen hot chocolate, which I really liked. It was really chocolate-y, and I thought a lot less like a milk shake than I thought it'd be. I'd get it again. We split the bachelorette hot dog, which was eighteen inches long, and came with eight different topping, not including ketchup and mustard. It was so good! It was ginormous though- not only was it long, it was thick. Every girls dream ;) We weren't able to finish it, we were so stuffed (no pun intended), we didn't get to try any sundae's or deserts. Would definitely go back, worth every penny!\n\nOh, and they have a thousand dollar sundae, which I would love to see in person one day..."

The only downside is the long wait for dinner.

We looked at the menu posted outside and much to my surprise they had an impressive looking selection of various dogs.  Bingo!  We were also intrigued by the decor and all of the sundaes on the menu.  There was a wait (20 minutes) so we grabbed a beer nearby.  We got seated in about 10 minutes and the waitress handed us menus but no hot dogs were featured on it.  FAIL!!!  I told them I wanted to order a hot dog and she informed us that it was Sunday and they have Sunday brunch and \"this\" menu until 2:00 (it was 1:30).  I remarked that the menu posted outside listed a selection of hot dogs and asked if they could serve me one anyway.  I got a very quick \"NO.\"  Not the way to do business folks.  She should have checked with the kitchen before abruptly answering me.  I am sure they could have done it.  Any other time, we would have left but we were hungry.  We ended up ordering wings to split and a sundae to split.  The portions we were seeing looked enormous.   Our wings arrived and they were very good.  The wait on the sundae was beyond slow.  I had to ask several times and she kept telling me it would be right up (I ordered a peanut butter sundae with hot fudge and marshmallow).  In the midst of the wait, there was also a waitress change and I had to ask her to check on the sundae.  FINALLY, the sundae came out and it was also very good.  Portions were easily ample enough to split between two people.  This place only gets 2 stars from me for their very poor customer service and the fact that although the food was very good, it was also very ordinary.  Mediocrity is not a good combination with poor customer service.  Won't be back here."

It really is the epitome of what you don't want to see at a restaurant:\n\n1) Over-priced\n2) Touristy/Gimmicky\n3) Sub-par service\n4) Sub-par food\n\nI've been here previously for lunch and knew I didn't want to go back, but I went here for dinner recently to oblige my pregnant cousin who really wanted to try the frozen hot chocolate. To me, frozen hot chocolate just means it must be similar to milkshake, so I've never had the urge to have it. Some positive things - they accepted my Total Rewards card for a minor discount on some items. Negative things - during my Open Table reservation, I noted we were celebrating a birthday, a pregnancy and a graduation - none of which were acknowledged in the slightest during our stay. Night of our reservation, I was also trying to call ahead to let them know we'd be late coming from the Mirage, but there was no answer at all and I had let it ring for a long time. My sister, who has high blood pressure due to her love of everything fatty and salty (she puts mayo on everything), thought the burger we ordered was overly salty. She was right, there were huge balls of salt within the patty. My pregnancy cousin asked the runner who delivered her food for ranch, and he just walked away without looking at her and said they just ran out of ranch. A few seconds later, I asked the runner who delivered my food for ranch, and he brought it to me quickly. My cousins ended up being underwhelmed by the frozen hot chocolate. We had ordered 2 for the table, both of which went unfinished. This place is one of the least romantic places you can be in if you are spending a weekend in Las Vegas. Staff works hard and they get so busy handling tourists, but you are much better off going somewhere else. Annoying bachelorette parties should all come here though - they can free up space in the nicer restaurants :D"

I ended up taking the rest to my room and had leftovers that night and in the morning and shared it.

I shared the Steak and Egg sandwich with 2 other girls and it was really good. Don't get greedy and try to get this to eat by yourself. It is really big. It comes on a baguette, it has eggs (over easy), steak, cheese, and bacon. If you don't like your eggs runny, get them over medium. This sandwich is really good, I enjoyed a lot. The bread is a little tough but wow the flavors on this sandwich just hit the spot. If i come back here, I just want to come for this item. Get it with the sweet potato fries, those were pretty good too.\nThe frozen hot chocolate is good at first, but be a bit much for one person, just share it.

            "review": "There we were during Restaurant Week, exploring the finer things in life. We decided on a more of a dessert kind of feel dinner, and so we decided on a place called Serendipity 3. Located right off the strip in front of Caesars, it definitely wasn't an easy restaurant to access. As soon as we were seated our waiter just dropped off menus without saying one word and let us be. After what seemed like an eternity, the waiter finally came back and asked us if we were ready to order. I then immediately asked if I can get the restaurant week menu. The waiter then replied saying that there were no specials that he was aware of. I literally busted out my phone and showed him that Serendipity 3 was a part of restaurant week and showed him the specials. He then left and asked one of his fellow colleagues that acknowledged that they did have a restaurant week menu. So the waiter comes by and finally acknowledges that there was a special menu, without any sort of an apology. He took our order and then left. I'm a very patient person when it comes to bad service. What I mean is I have taken a lot of crap without complaining, but this guy was just the worst. First of all he was very soft spoken, and had a very bad attitude problem. What's the first rule of working in the service industry? Leave your problems at the door, and put a smile on your face. This guy definitely needed a lesson in service. Anyways, after all the rude remarks and attitude he gave us while ordering, our food finally came out. Before our food even came out, I noticed the waiter just went around and asked everyone else how they were doing, and completely ignored us. I was without a drink for 15 plus minutes, and did I mention the food came out very slow. I can tell it wasn't the cooks fault, it was our waiter. My chicken dish I've ordered was cold to the core; not even a little feel of warmth. I just let it slide and finished my dinner. The most anticipated part of the meal finally came out, dessert. I've noticed that he has gotten our order wrong, and then informed him of his mistake. Once again without any apology he just takes the plate without a word. I can see his facial expression of disgust as he walked away. The nerves of this guy were incredible! To make the story short, we enjoyed our dessert very much.  Needless to say our waiter never came back after correcting his mistake. My friends and I sat there socializing for a long period of time.  All I can hear is the slurps from the straw, since the drinks were empty. Honestly I just wanted the check so we can leave, but our waiter was nowhere to be found.  When I finally saw our waiter, I politely tried to gain his attention. He totally just ignored me and walked on by. Finally I went up to the front and asked if I could get my check, and the hostess instructed us to ask our waiter. At this point I was furious and asked for a manager. The manager was very nice and offered us a complimentary lunch on them. One thing I believe the manager made a mistake was when he said, \"Yeah, we get complaints on him all the time.\" When I heard that, in my head I was like, \"Then why is he still working here!?\" Thanks to that rude waiter, I will never go back to Serendipity again. I even have a complimentary meal, but no thanks!"

The chocolate used is yummy, the whipped cream is fresh, and the cool contrast of a rich drink you'd expect to have warm is appealing, but it's hard not to overlook this place as just an overpriced Vegas tourist trap. Not to mention you're gonna need a fat water to actually quench your thirst after slamming down one of these.

We had a lovely table on the patio overlooking the strip.  It was enjoyable.  I ordered the Chicken & Waffles.  The chicken was mediocre.  Maybe I just prefer greasy KFC much better.  However, the waffles were good.  Big, thick, crunchy on the outside pieces.  My husband had the Chicken Strips.  Nothing spectacular.  Tasted the same as something you could get at a place like TGIFs but the dipping sauces were good.  I was a little disappointed that the lunch menu isn't as good as the dinner menu.  I'd much rather go here for dinner.  Especially since I love the chicken pot pie and chicken alfredo so much.  Again, too full to even think about trying dessert.  Even though I wasn't blown away by the food, I still love Serendipity."

Once inside your senses are overloaded... lots of stuff on the walls, music blasting. It's fun, but not appreciated by my parents. \n\nAfter much deliberation (so many good looking items on the menu!), I got a cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. Definitely thumbs up on the portions - huge and plentiful. I'm a fan of sweet potato fries, but these came sprinkled with brown sugar. I know this place is known for it's sweets, but seriously. Yuck, not my thing. The burger was good. Juicy and tasty, for sure, definitely would recommend. The burger came on a sort of sweet bun. It was ok, but not my fav, guess I'm more of a savory person. My mom had the asian salad - it was gigantic! And tasted awesome. I should've gotten that. \n\nSecond visit of the trip my sister and I split a frozen hot chocolate. Tasty! Not quite a milkshake, but not chocolate milk. Good dessert if you have room after their large portioned meals. We used the takeout window for this order, which was easier and faster. \n\nIf you want to check out the hype, I recommend just going to the takeout window and eating outside or taking it inside Caesars. It's good, but not worth the trouble of doing the whole sit down meal thing. I think I'd come back and try some of their other dishes, but only if I were staying nearby. Don't think this is worth trekking across the strip for in 100 degree heat."

I recommend the deep fried Oreos sundae if your not a fan of frozen hot chocolate. I got the deep fried Twinkie which is good but the deep fried Oreo are better. Let's hope this place doesn't turn into a Margarita-Ville because it's heading that direction. Another small criticism is I wish their pickles were dill instead of sweet."

This visit receives 2 stars.\n\nOn our second visit (we were drunk) we got the All In Nachos and Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza. The nachos look delicious, but they taste so-so. I was really bummed that they just put melted cheese on the nachos instead of using nacho cheese (cheese whiz). Also, the chips underneath the top layer were pretty much missing all of the \"All In\" toppings so we were just eating plain chips. Thankfully, the Margherita Pizza was good so kicked the nachos to the side and feasted on the pizza. This visit receives 2 stars as well.\n\nIf you want to try Serendipity I recommend coming after you've had a few drinks so you won't be pissed off about dropping $70+ dollars on a so so meal."

The chocolate tasted like the syrup you get at the bottom of a regular hot chocolate - very potent - but mixed nicely with the peanut butter and was even better when toned down by mixing in the whipped cream. Overall, decent. Extremely casual atmosphere inside."

Although I lived in NYC for many years, I always avoided Serendipity since it seemed like a huge tourist trap. The Vegas one is obviously not much different, but since they have a to-go counter, I figured it could be a nice refreshing snack on a hot day. Let me just say - I was mistaken. I can basically summarize the taste Frozen Hot Chocolate as chocolate powder dumped into a very weak skim milk icee. The flavor was so, so damn weak. I kept drinking it hoping it maybe wasn't mixed very well, but nope, it had the same weak flavor of Swiss Mix, only in frozen form. That being said, I won't ever be back for the Frozen Hot Chocolate, but I might stop in for one of their other desserts."

I will say though, I did hear that the Frozen Hot Chocolate was supposed to be warm AND cold at the same time, hence the name, but it all tasted like a milkshake. I mean, it was still good, but I was a bit disappointed in that tiny bit about it.\n\nWell, not only did it seem like our waiter completely forgot about us while we ate, it took forever for him to show up after we were finished eating so we could get the check.

Then this family came and cut in, this lady ( the mom) cut in with a straight face and didn't even care cause she knows she's doing it on purpose. My husband told her husband we were in line but I said to him it's ok cause they were only party of 3 and we have 6 in our group anyway. Then I told my husband, \"just be grateful your not married to that kind of woman.\" And the husband heard, the husband and her kid was embarrassed by that woman's attitude. People, don't embarrass your family just for a table! Anyway, so we got our table....our waitress asked what we want for a drink, I gave her our order and I said that's all and I said \"That's all\"....and she said, \"that's all you are going to order\". And I'm thinking for a drink \"yes\". She left and I saw her whispering to another waitress, and I'm like..... hmmmm???? Then I came close To her register and asked to sing for my daughter, so she said to order a desert, so I did and she  brought the sundae with a candle and DIDN'T even sing to my daughter.... She just left it on our table. So we just sang to my daughter, just us!!!! How RUDE!!!! Our waitress is this black lady, that looks like a unemployed stripper/semi retired prostitute. And she's also too slow!!! Then we were waiting to order, looking at their yummy looking food. And we can't understand why she's taking too long to come back.

This place is understaff..... their sundae are too sweet, the frozen chocolate drink that everyone is talking about is too grainy. YuKkk!!! And they have one dumb black waitress that needs training.

What is nice is that while of course you're paying more than you would at an off-strip dining establishment, you're at least feeling like you're getting your moneys worth. My favorite cholesterol level raising option is their steak sandwich. It comes on a loaf (yeah a goddamn loaf) of garlic bread, an entire NY strip steak, bacon, and perfectly runny over easy eggs. It's $22 bucks (it seems pricey, I know), but it's big enough to share and both parties will be full and a little bit closer to a heart attack. Another favorite of mine is the lump crab and artichoke dip.It's decadent, indulgent, it's everything you want in a creamy, rich appetizer. I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the frozen hot chocolates. I've tried the original, the peanut butter, and the cookies and cream. Cookies and cream is my favorite, it's creamy, sweet and I'm sure it goes straight to your thighs. The original is alright, but I feel like it is missing the creaminess that like in a cold chocolate drink. Peanut butter was kinda gross and I didn't finish it. It had a lot more to do with the peanut butter taste not really gelling with the cold uncreamy texture that's inherent in this drink. If you really like peanut butter taste, but don't require a creamy texture, i.e. you eat crunchy peanut butter, you'll probably like it. If you like creamy peanut butter like Texans love guns, skip it. \n\nService is hit or miss here. Usually good, but sometimes (especially if you're sitting outside I've noticed) your server seems to forget you and you have to wait for everything. The other thing I'm not a fan of is there indoor seating arrangements. I understand you want to maximize your space with tables because mo' tables, mo' money, but it's pretty cramped inside. Overall, if you're living in town and wanted to try it, try and go on a weekday during the low season. If you're an out-of-towner wanting to try this place out, prepare for a long wait (maybe have dessert BEFORE dinner and grab an iced hot chocolate while you're waiting) and consider sharing."

I suggest parking over at the Flamingo or Bill's and walking across the bridge; it's probably about the same distance from parking in CP's garage and walking through the casino."

There is something off with theirs.  However, it still somewhat satisfies the cravings when you can't get to NYC every weekend. \n\nIf you can sit outside, do it.  You have a view of the entire strip and that makes it worth a little wait. Just don't eat there. The food in the NYC one was never great, and the LV isn't any different. LV has great restaurants, go to one of those and then here for dessert. If there is a long wait, don't wait around. Go to the bar, order it to go, and get out of there and enjoy Vegas!"

For that amount of money, I was expecting something that eluded excellence from the very first sip. \n\nThe service was also tremendously slow and it wasn't even crowded.  We saw our food sitting under heat lamps just waiting to be brought to our table for a good 15 minutes or so.  I've had better breakfast at iHop and cheaper.

The frozen chocolate was good (albeit pricey).   I was really quite aggravated by the way the staff did not seem to care about seating us and for that reason gave a 1 star."

Yes, the ever famous Serendipity from the movies, and the place that the celebrities go to. They are known for their frozen hot chocolate.\n\nI wasn't feeling the wait and nothing on the menu really interested me. However, I had to try the frozen hot chocolate. On the back side of Serendipity 3, where I was at, they had a take out window. Yay, I was finally going to get to try the frozen hot chocolate! They had a lot of tables and seats back there, so it was take your pick. Be careful to look before you sit though, because a lot of the seats had bird poop.\n\nI went up to the window and ordered my frozen hot chocolate. It was $10 and served in one of those plastic drink cups. I was actually watching the woman make it. She had chocolate syrup and threw it into the blender with some ice. Then, she added whip cream on the top with chocolate shavings. Was it worth the $10, probably not. I'm going to have to agree with all the other reviews that said it tasted like Swiss Miss blended with ice. You could probably make this at home for 40 cents. At least I can say that I actually tried it. Another food item crossed off my list."

I ended up eating the toppings and the outside crust where it was still crisp.\n\nI took a few bites of my girlfriend's ahi tuna salad. It was decent, except I quickly realized that there was too much dressing, and the dressing was too sweet.

When I came to this location located in front of Caesars, I was surprised and pleased to see they have upgraded there menu and have numerous delicious flavors to choose from.  We had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table, however it wasn't too bad as they text you when your table is ready.  Honestly it was hard to choose just one flavor after perusing the menu.  They also have a number of amazing desserts to choose from, as well as brunch, lunch, and dinner options.  We had come here strictly for the frozen hot chocolate, thus I decided to stick to that.  My parents and I split the almond amaretto flavor as the waitress told us that was the most popular flavor on the menu after the regular chocolate one.  I wanted to try something new as I had the chocolate one in NYC.  We got the smaller size (meant for 1) and it was absolutely HUGE.  It also comes with a mound of whip cream adding to the already yummy flavor.  We all loved it and would definitely come back to try another flavor.  Our server was really sweet and drink came out fast.   \n\nCan definitely get on the pricier side as our one frozen hot chocolate was $14.  Most of the desserts are in that price range as well and then menu items run around $17 and up.  \n\nNote:  If you have a rewards card from Caesars, Ballys, Planet Hollywood, or Paris it gets you $1 off each menu item, so sign up for that-it's free!"

It was looking at me, taunting me, telling me that I am not good enough to devour it's richy goodness.  Well HA!!  I got the last laugh as I gobbled this thing down like it was the last meal on earth.  Forks moving at light speed, crumbs flying, frosting being splattered on the patrons surrounding me.  It was a mess and it was all mine!!\n\nLets be clear, this is not your ordinary piece of carrot cake.  It was huge and large enough to share.  Did I?  Of course not.  The cream cheese frosting is perfect in texture and a nice combination with moistness of the cake itself.  In hindsight, I could have done without the cake.  While good, the frosting is what makes it great!\n\nSerendipity also features a $1000 Golden Opulence Sundae.  This gem must be ordered 48 hours in advance and who has that kind of time?  I haven't a clue what they could possibly put in this thing that is worth that kind of bank but I wasn't about to find out.

To be more specific, get the ABC burger with sweet potato fries. Nomnomnom! Ginormous salads and the strip steak sandwich is da-bomb (sorry I'm a 90s kid, can't help it). For breakfast, the hangover omelet with seasoned potatoes never disappoints. Ohh I almost forgot, the strawberry fields sundae is the best! Strawberry fields forever! :)"

We had a couple hours to kill after checking out of our hotel at Caesar's Palace and this was conveniently located right in front of the main entrance to the lobby! We sat at the bar and they had great menu. Went for the steak and eggs and it was simply perfect. Also had cappuccino and a Bellini which was one of the best Bellini I've had! Highly recommend!"

I've ordered ice cream from the window twice while walking on the Vegas Strip.  The first time I waited over 20 minutes to order.  No big deal since I was just people watching and enjoying the weather.  After another 15 minutes of waiting at window #2 a delicious ice cream appeared.  I will give them credit for a yummy ice cream sundae.\n\nRound two was the same routine of waiting with a crowd that was becoming restless and angry for over 30 minutes.  This time when my ice cream sundae finally appeared it had the wrong flavor ice cream.  I had ordered vanilla and it was chocolate.  No biggie, who doesn't like chocolate?  Then I discovered it was all melted and ruined.  Threw it in the trash (after eating the whipped cream off of course).  No way I could have gotten through the angry mob to ask for a replacement.  The price of a sundae is $10.00.  Geez, I'm a sucker right?  I plan to write Caesar's Palace and ask for a $10.00 credit.  I love the Qua Waters Spa and I think that's where I would use the credit.

When I think of Serendipity 3, I think of desserts.  \n\nHuge desserts.  \n\nI haven't had their food before, but the Vegas location passed the A-OK test.\n\nI remember having the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, Peanut Butter Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, and their Banana Split at their New York location last year.  All were good (esp the peanut butter), but my senses can take only so much sugar.\n\nThis time around, I wanted a meal.  Wait time was nil.  Like their desserts, their food offerings were just as enormous.  The High Heel Pump (I felt fruity for ordering it, so I pointed to it when our server took our orders) had succulent prosciutto, arugula, tomatoes, and plenty of other healthy ingredients.  Once I was finished, my body craved more unhealthy food and juicy meat the way Harold & Kumar craved White Castle.  \n\nSo being the human trash compactor that I am, I finished my cousin's burger (the one with caramelized onions and melted brie) as well as part of my sister's Foot Long Hot Dog with all the fixings - relish, saurkraut, chopped onions, and a spiced mayonnaise.  It ain't no foot-long hot dog neeva!  It's gotta be 18\" (that's what she said).  As for the burger, it may have been a quality piece of beef, but it lacked salt.  At least it tasted clean and fresh.\n\nThe Strawberry Supreme drink was refreshing in that desert (not dessert) Vegas heat.  It had hints of Kool-Aid, fresh smoothie taste, and an unexplainable gratifying heft to it.  \n\nI want to see someone order that $1,000 Golden Opulence Sundae.  Our server said she hasn't seen it, but her co-workers have and it's been ordered once a month for the past several months during the evenings.  Looks like I'll have to go back and win big.\n\nBottom line:  \n\nOur server (Barbara) was as sweet as Serendipity's desserts (one of Sin City's finest), but this location's ambience lacked the charm and character of its New York sister.\n\n\n9.21"

I've had the luxury of trying the original location in NYC and I'm sad to say that I prefer the food and drinks here.\n\nThere were 4 of us and we each ordered something different.  Mushroom burger, some sort of hot dog, chicken burger, and buffalo wings and we were all pretty content with the quality.  Nothing too spectacular, but not too shabby either.  Personally, I probably wouldn't eat here all the time since Vegas has so many options, but this place is a must try for one thing.\n\nWhat stole our hearts that visit were the double frozen hot chocolates.  Me and my gf refused to share one of those ginormous, heaping chocolate milkshake-ish desserts because we are greedy lil heffers so we each got our own.  The guys got the regular frozen hot chocolate and that did not compare.  You have to get the double because they add icecream and the texture is so rich and much creamier.   Thinking back, it probably would've been a better idea to share, especially after the big meal.  It felt like a never ending fountain of chocolate goodness and by the time we were halfway done, we felt so sick from all that sugar and brain freeze.  But we were all smiles regardless!!\n\n~$14 for the regular frozen hot chocolate and I think we paid ~$22 for the double.  A bit steep, but when you're in Vegas, you gotta live life in the fast lane!"

It wasn't the line that I was most upset about (I don't mind a long line if my food is good) well with that being said, our pretzel wasn't all that great, it was hard and cold. I'm not quite sure if that was their intention of how they make pretzels, but I sure don't like it that way and I don't enjoy hard rock pretzels. The most deceiving part was the long line that everyone was hanging out in front of to get some good quality food, maybe everyone else's food was good, but mine sure wasn't. When the employee handed me my pretzel, man was I was surprised to see how big it was and how yummy it was going to taste, but man was I so disappointed to have a rock of a pretzel. I just expected more for a long line, if you know what I mean. I guess this place was just all hype of a line.\n\nI probably won't be coming back here, if I do, I'm sure it won't be for a pretzel.

It was kinda hard to bite because it was stacked up high. It was kind of small, but enough for me. The burger came with these awesome sweet potato fries. My definite favorite. I asked for some honey mustard, which made it even more bomb. The meat was cooked correctly and was full of flavor. For dessert, I got the frozen hot chocolate which was alright.

Outside we go.\n\nWe sat at the bar, and all 3 of us got a draft Blue Moon ($7 for  a 16 oz glass). Scanning the menu, I immediately took notice of how pricey things were- hence the 4 stars. Instead of each ordering something separate, we split an appetizer of nachos ($14), and got the meat lovers pizza ($20) to share. It was PLENTY of food for 3 people, we actually made ourselves eat everything because for the price you didn't wanna waste it. Still ended up with some nachos left over..\n\nThe food was SO good! Seriously, we kept talking about how delicious it was. It came out fairly quick too...we were not waiting a long time at all. Sitting at the outside bar just enjoying the view and talking- it was a nice first meal in Vegas. I have no complaints other than the price. ($$-$$$ depending on what you order) We did not get dessert even though I would have loved to try something. \n\nI would definitely come back here again!"

            "review": "The food was great. We came at twelve forty and had a ten minute wait. My guy was annoyed because there were tables open and the one he said we were going to get that had been open the entire time was the one we got. I got a groupon that included two salads, two burgers, and a frozzen hot chocolate to share. Got offered water while we waited for the waitress which took about ten minutes. When she came we ordered the burgers with the salad. The salads sit on the side of the hot plate ready to grab and go. We sat for thirty minutes waiting for the salads. We got our burgers from the food runner when she stopped and asked if we had gotten our salads. So she brought mine and replaced my guys with an extra order of sweet potato fires on the house since he didn't want the salad since the burger was right there. As soon as se got the fries (two minutes) she asked to take my salad away. I just let her since it seemed like it was a big deal for me to eat that and my fries. I looked at my burger and noticed they forgot my avocado I orders on the cheese burger. Had to stop the food runner to get it. While we were half way threw the fries the waitress came back and asked if we were ready to have her put in dessert. we agrees. She came fast with the dessert and check and requested to take the fries. Since I had the groupon I only had to pay for the extra things like drinks and add on to the burger. Free refills but the soda is five bucks. I put my card in and had the check standing up while we eat dessert since I only had a ten and felt bad if I only gave a two dollar tip. even though my guy thinks any tip was to much since he has worked in the past as a dish runner to head waiter in high school to college.But no one came to get the card and the place at this point was basically empty since it was almost two and lunch rush was over.  So they got the bill I had and we left. \nThe food was amazing. Looks just like the picture. The burgers taste great and I loved the regular fries. If it wasn't for the waiting staff being so non attentive and rushing I would have given it five stars."

Also, our server never brought us silverware, so it wasn't until we all had our food sitting in front of us for a couple of minutes that we finally got some forks and what not.\n\nI ordered the Oriental Chicken Salad - not a bad salad, but not great. For $15, it definitely wasn't the best salad I've had. I also ordered a Mimosa during lunch, which I liked. I liked that they not only brought the champagne glass, but also brought the remaining amount of champagne in the champagne bottle. fancy&cute!\n\noverall, the experience here was okay... slow service, pricey food. it looks like from other reviews that the desserts are good. maybe ill come back to try it, or maybe ill come back if friends want to. other than that, it wasn't anything too crazy memorable."

The hype is real when it comes to Serendipity 3. \n\nFirst off the decor and seating are both adorable and comfortable. There are both indoor and outdoor seating so take your pick. We choose to sit indoor of course since it was the middle of the summer during our trip. \n\nThe service: not too bad not too good. I mean the waiters didn't wait on us hand and foot the entire time but they were attentive and were helpful when we asked. You can't really expect too much when your restaurant  is packed on a Monday afternoon. \n\nThe food: delicious and not to mention huge portions!\nMy boyfriend and I shared a regular frozen mint hot chocolate, a foot long chili dog, and a side of onion rings. He also had a small drink but I forgot the exact name of the drink. \nFirst and most importantly the frozen hot chocolate is a must. The mint flavored one is out of this world. If I had to describe what a frozen hot chocolate is exactly I would say it is a cross between a regular hot chocolate and a chocolate shake. It was very light, creamy, and pretty much the best thing I have had since I discovered ice cream!\nThe foot long hot dog was HUGE! The pictures do not do it justice. My boyfriend and I spilt the hotdog and we were full till way past dinner time. While the hotdog itself and the chili was nothing too out of this world it was an interesting eat due to the fact the dog was served on a French loaf rather than a traditional hotdog bun. \nThe onion rings were delicious. They were perfectly friend and crispy. The side portion came with about 4-6 small onion rings which was a perfect size for us. \n\nOverall my experience here was wonderful and I will definitely be back here next time I am in Vegas. One day when I am rich and famous I plan to come back to order the ultimate $1000 sundae!! That's the dream."

His mashed potatoes were a soupy consistency. I have a picture if you wanna see.\n\nMy ABC Chicken sandwich was okay, the C stands for caramelized onions, but it was cold by the time I got a hold of it so they were more like soggy worms. Okay, that's not a fact, I don't know what worms are like but I can imagine.\n\nMore facts:\nSomeone in our party ordered a burger with no pink, but when he bit into it it was still bloody. The waiter did pop by 30 minutes later and asked if he wanted it remade but everyone's bubble had been burst by then. \n\nI told the manager I wasn't happy with my experience or the quality of the food. She was offended when I compared it to Red Robin, but I've never had a cold meal or left dissatisfied, so I think I did Red Robin a disservice by comparing these two. Sorry big red bird.\n\nAfter the manager got over her indignation, she comped us a sundae. So our party of 8 shared a sundae. Kudos lady, thanks.\n\nI felt bad that my family wasted time and money here. It was my decision and I have to live the rest of my life with that on my shoulders. Maybe I'll write the company instead of writing a passive-aggressive review on a third-party site... I think I'll do that."

One of the girls recommended Serendipity, and being that we were all somewhat drunk and hungry, we agreed. Well, we showed up and since the weather was nice outside we elected to sit out on the patio that is right next to 'The Strip' and had a great view of all the lights and passer-bys. Unfortunately, the allure of sitting on the patio stopped at the view. To start, it was almost as if they put us out on the patio and proceeded to completely forget that they put us there. When we were seated we were told that someone would be by shortly to take our drink orders... I guess they didn't know how thirsty we were and what a buzz kill they were being, because our waiter didn't come by for about 15 minutes. \n\nAside from my gripe about the slow service on the patio is the fact that about a half hour into dinner there was literally, and I kid you not, a wind storm that erupted. So bad in fact, that one of our friends who had a 7 p.m. flight into Vegas had her flight grounded and delayed until the following morning due to wind. So, as silverware was blowing off of tables and napkins went flying, we tried to flag down our waiter to be moved inside. The response that we received was; \"If you want to move inside then you are going to have to put your name on the waiting list and wait for a table to open inside. The current wait is an hour.\" Ummm... what?! We had drinks in hand and appetizers on the table and you're telling me that we would have to put our name on the waiting list? You are SO accommodating! Thank you! (Those last two statements were completely laced with sarcasm.)\n\nI guess I should talk about the food now. Oh, and for those of you wondering: we stayed out on the patio throughout our whole meal... good times. Anyways... for dinner I started with a caesar salad and then ordered buffalo chicken strips for dinner. The salad was fine; How could you screw up caesar salad? The buffalo chicken strips were ok. They weren't crispy and steaming hot like I wanted, but at least it was sustenance. When the chicken strips arrived it looked as if they had sat on the counter waiting to get run to our table for a few minutes too long. The sauce had gotten cold and had pulled off some of the crispy breading. However, give a girl some ranch dressing and blue cheese and she can make anything taste decent."

We eyed a bar nearby and proceeded to buy a shot of Kahlua (which was more like 2 shots the way that bartender poured it) and mixed it into the frozen hot chocolate. Bliss! It was phenomenally better and definitely would recommend it. Be prepared for sticker shock when you buy the frozen hot chocolate at $9 for a regular and spend another $10 for a shot of kahlua. Apparently that's how it works in Vegas. I say just make sure you have a mini bottle of kahlua on hand when you head to Serendipity. It'll save you $10."

No biggie.. It's Vegas. However, our food took FOREVER. Other tables that came after us got their food and were gone before we got ours. After nearly an hour, we finally got our food. I ordered nachos and my cheese tasted like plastic- had obviously been sitting somewhere for a long time. My friend sent her omelet back because apparently her food was cold and plastic-like too. \n\nSince the food took so long, we decided to order the frozen hot chocolates as they served our food.. in case it was going to take another hour to bring out too. But of course, they brought those out right away instead. Not sure how they came out such a melted mess considering they came out so quickly, but we had to scoop the whipped cream back on to attempt a cute picture of them. So basically we had our cold entrees and melted frozen hot chocolates served all at once. \n\nFor the $15 we spent on each frozen hot chocolate, I'd suggest for a similar experience- buying a Frosty from Wendy's, putting it in a pretty sundae dish, adding whipped cream and garnishing with shaved chocolate."

Unfortunately, turned out to be a very disappointing meal for me.  \n\nFirst of all, $11 for the \"frozen hot chocolate\"?? This can't be the same treat that the whole world raves about.  It was too icy, WAY too sweet, and tasted like a concoction I could whip up at home with some instant nestle powder.  I was not alone on this boat, many of my fellow diners agreed with me.  Even my friend from New York who regularly frequents the original manhattan serendipity- she thought the one served here was of inferior quality.  If you must order one of these tourist trap treats, I suggest the Amaretto flavor- much better tasting than the regular one.  \n\nBreakfast did not fare much better.  I wanted to order the egg white shrimp frittata-  but the waitress told me they ran out (really? at 10:30am??)  Instead, I ordered the fried eggs benedict (Corn Meal Crusted Fried Poached Eggs, Classic Hollandaise & Canadian Bacon atop Sausage Gravy & House Made Biscuit). When the dish arrived, it certainly looked pretty enough!  But alas, it did not taste as good as it looked.  I hoped that despite the egg being fried, the yolk would still be relatively runny.  My hopes were quickly dashed. The lack of creamy yolkiness took all the fun away from eating an eggs benedict :( The hollandaise sauce was too sparse and the biscuit was too dry and tough to cut- not flaky at all.  All in all, probably the worst eggs benedict I've had.  \n\nThe other girls ordered the staple brunch dishes (french toast, chicken&waffles, omelet).  Portions were massive and it made for great photo-ops.  But in the end, nobody raved about their food, and we took back ~70% of it in doggie bags.  On a brighter note, our leftovers were put to good use later that evening as a drunken midnight snack.  I guess beer-goggles can apply to tastebuds as well!"

The pizza was pretty big, containing about 5 huge slices, enough for 2 people but i can see how a single hungry person can devour it.  The buffalo sauce was pretty spicy and the added blue cheese definitely is a must.  The crab artichoke dip was tangy but it was a big portion.  Lastly the sundae...I can say we were in for more than we bargained for.  It was a huge piece of carrot cake on top of vanilla ice cream topped with frosting.  It was so large that by the time we got to the ice cream portion, it had already melted (which was a bummer).  I felt that for the price we paid ($56) I would want smaller portions so that i can enjoy the dish, rather than trying to race through before the ice cream melted.  Go for the frozen ice chocolate, but you can find better food for better pricing on the strip."

I love dessert, and it was about 6,000 degrees outside. The restaurant was conveniently located just outside of our hotel, so we trudged our way over and placed our orders at the take-out window in the back (for those customers who are not in the mood for a sit-down meal). We then forked over $11 each, received our drinks (the basic Frrrozen Hot Chocolate) and trudged over to the seating area closest to the water misters.\n\nMaybe it would have been better to sit down and order inside the restaurant. Who knows? All I know is that I was very saddened by my frozen hot chocolate. Because that sounds really fancy! That sounds like it should be exotic and delicious! But after a sip or two, it dawned on me that we'd totally just spent $11 on a glorified chocolate milkshake that was probably worth $2-3 at most.\n\nThere is nothing interesting, exciting or innovative about the frozen hot chocolate at all. It's not even that tasty. I had been taken for a ride. I will be happy to never return to Serendipity 3.\n\nBut I do like the font they use on their menu."

Indoor and outdoor seating is available, which is great for good weather. The problem I had with this location was the service and food quality. \n\nIt wasn't very busy when we arrived, so we were seated right away (Note: we were seated right away, because it wasn't busy). However, the server didn't come greet us until 10 minutes in. And when he did, there was no apology for the delay. We ordered the sweet potato waffle fries and some ice teas. The drinks came out relatively quickly, but the fries took another 15 minutes. When they came out they were cold; and I don't mean not hot, I mean cold. The server also didn't tell us that they were out of the cinnamon dipping sauce until after he brought out the fries. Again, no apology, just stated as a matter of fact. \n\nWhen the server brought the fries out, we ordered a frozen hot chocolate (their staple drink). After 25 minutes, it finally came out. Again, no apology for the delay. After another 20 minutes, we had to chase the server down for the check. All to say, total time there was over an hour, for a couple of ice teas, sweet potato waffle fries and frozen hot chocolate. \n\nThey have a quick service window outside. I'd recommend using the quick window and sitting outside (weather permitting)."

Actually, it wasn't that hard to do, all I had to do was mention frozen hot chocolate.\n\nIt was January 1st and we needed a hangover cure. We were told that the wait was 45 minutes, but since it was freezing and we noticed everyone's great-looking food, we stayed. Other than the hostesses barking at people to get out of the doorway (there was a huge crowd, no waiting area, and nowhere for people to really stand), the wait didn't take long at all, and we were seated after about 20 minutes. \n\nThe cute decor made you feel like you were in a pretty, trendy NYC cafe. I've never visited the NYC location, but Las Vegas' all-out glamorous decor seemed like a good answer to it. Feeling particularly like lard asses, we ordered the mac and cheese, chili cheese dog, and one of the sandwiches with turkey, brie, and apple slices. And 2 frozen hot chocolates to share, of course. Our waiter was cool, upbeat, and even switched tables for us when he heard us joking that it wasn't level. \n\nI've met very few mac and cheeses I didn't like, but this one was off the charts. It came in a deep dish with a rich sauce and prosciutto chunks. So perfect for a cold, hungover day. My friend's chili cheese dog was ridiculously long and she only got about halfway through, and our other friends' open-faced sandwich was great as well. The hot chocolate was decadently delicious, but not $10 so.\n\nI liked this place for the huge menu of both healthy and comfort food, the cocktail list, great waitstaff and cute decor. I disliked the hostesses who thought they were the ish for working at such a \"cool\" place, the expensive prices, and the way that the bathrooms were outside the restaurant. Our food was great, but the prices still seemed overinflated and as if we were paying for the image and novelty. Glad I got to try it, though!"

Frozen hot chocolate anyone? \n\nSince I wasn't able to go to the location in New York, I figured I would just go in Vegas. First time I went on Christmas, for lunch, I went myself and sat at the bar (since the wait was about 30 minutes for a table). I ordered myself a frozen hot chocolate and a side of sweet potato fries. The frozen hot chocolate is HUGE. The size for one is plenty for a table. The bar is a great place to eat if all your people are over 21 and there are seats there. The frozen hot chocolate itself \n\nThe second time I went with the kids on the trip to vegas (4 of them between 16 and 18). I reserved a table for all of us, but we were able to be seated quite quickly. At around 10, there aren't as many people in the restaurant. The service, though, once seated was a little spotty. It took a while to get someone to take our order..and then get the food. \n\nThe smores hot chocolate (which is what one of the girls got) looked good, but they forgot the graham crackers and didn't bring them until we asked for them. Also the hot chocolate had a huge mound of marshmallows so if you dont like those - don't get it. \n\nMy brother ended up getting the Oreo version of the frozen hot chocolate which tasted like oreo hot chocolate but cold. This second time I ordered the Forbidden Broadway Sundae (chocolate blackout cake, chocolate and vanilla ice creams, and a shit ton of whipped cream). So delicious, but halfway in, I was so full, I couldn't take another bite. The cake wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. \n\nOverall, big portions. Decent desserts. Always make a reservation and you'll be fine. Or sit at the bar. Service will be spotty, but you'll just have to deal with it."

Honestly, I don't remember a thing about how it tasted but I figured it must have been good if there is now one in Vegas!\n\nThe place was crazy busy when we arrived but luckily I spotted a 'takeout' window on the side.  No biggie since I only wanted the frozen hot chocolate anyway.  Looking at the menu while waiting in line, I was shocked at the price for the frozen hot chocolate.  Most flavors were $11.  Flavors like 'peanut butter, mint or vanilla'.  No hint of fancy chocolate like Lindt or Ghirardelli flakes that might make the price worth it.  I bought anyway, the mochachino flavor, I wanted peanut butter but they were out and $12.97 later, ($1 for a plastic glass of tap water) I stood by the window and waited for my frozen hot chocolate.  They are fast, I will give them that, but what passed from the window into my hand was basically a grande frappucino at three times the price.  I'm not sure what others were raving about because nothing in that glass could come close to being worth the $11 price tag for the drink.  \n\nAs my friend and I wondered exactly why there are so many people at Serendipity we could only guess that 1 -they'd never been there before or 2- like me they couldn't remember having it the first time.  Apparently, if you actually sit down in the restaurant, the frozen hot chocolate is much larger which might have made me feel a tiny bit better.  However, either way, the melted milkshake with a load of whipped cream that is the frozen hot chocolate is not worth your time or money.  Go somewhere else.  There are plenty of gelato places in Vegas where you can get your ice cream fix if that is what you desire for 1/3 of the price."

            "review": "Came in on a Sunday afternoon for a late brunch without a reservation, and my party and I were debating whether or not we should take the 30-45 minute wait for a table, or just go to the walk-up counter for something quick. One hostess was on an iPad organizing the reservation list, and the other was greeting at the door. The one on the iPad was very nice and the other greeter was the rudest hostess I've ever seen. While we were quickly discussing our options, she continued to raise her voice and interrupt us in an effort to get our attention and see what we decided. She rolled her eyes at us, shook her head and sighed heavily and dramatically, as if we made her wait hours rather than thirty seconds.  There wasn't a line behind us, so I wasn't sure why she could act so impatient since she was just standing there with no other customers in sight. She looked me right in the eye as she behaved this way, appallingly unapologetic. I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and I've never given attitude to a guest. Especially when they're deciding whether or not to give you business! That alone made the decision easy, we walked away! Tip to management, educate your greeters on the importance of a FRIENDLY face :)"

This place is really famous for their Frozen Hot Chocolate. I've tried their coffee flavored and i have to say it was pretty good. The prices can be a bit high, but you are in Las Vegas so it'll always be high (think of how much the Starbucks is across the street). I got their grilled cheese with tomato soup and that was delicious. So was their chicken strips, but when you think about it, you can probably get that somewhere else for a cheaper price. It's the ambience, location, and that frozen hot chocolate that you're kind of paying for. I recommend that you have a Total Rewards card because there is a discount for that. Enjoy the that Frozen Hot Chocolate!!!"

We ended up taking some of the chicken to go and I ordered the steak/egg sandwich to go as well for the boys to eat for lunch. It was huge and looked scrumptious.. probably why it was $16 or so bucks!! Yikes!\n\nNext time I come back, I will be trying their desserts for sure."

I was told they dont have a table ready for service for a party of 6. Really?!?  Its Vegas and this is a touristy place. \n\nAnd two ladies up front and so unwelcoming. Look bored/uninterested, Karen was on her phone, and pregnant lady seated other parties before us. Hope theyre not discriminating.\n\nFinally got a table after I complained to manager. SMH.\n\nNote:  Server is awesome though. Carrot cake is heavenly."

The desserts are always phenomenal, but the chili that my wife loved in Miami was not good here. It didn't taste or look luxurious like it did in Miami. It looked and tasted like hamburger meat versus being cubed with a slight sweetness in Miami. On a happier note, the wings were pretty good and the \"outrageous banana split\" was excellent. \n\nOverall: would go somewhere for lunch/ dinner and would come to Serendipity 3 for dessert."

Well now I can check that off the list....\n\nWhat I liked better was their gynormous jalapeno bacon pretzel that is shaped into a fancy \"S\".  Dip that into some mustard!"

I had the pizza and my friend had the pot pie and both were mediocre, nothing really special. For dessert we had the Frozen Hot Chocolate. It was something I had to try since it was their specialty but I probably would never get it again. It was good but too big, I had enough after a couple of sips."

Espresso, even with an added shot, tasted like instant coffee. Here's what really killed it for me:  the restrooms are by far the most repulsive I've seen in Vegas. I guess they were going for an authentic NYC vibe because they were exactly like public bathrooms in NYC subway stations. It was so vile I almost walked off out of fear of the sanitary conditions of this place. Such a disappointment.\n\nOh yeah, my food:  ordered their twist on eggs Benedict. Would've been quite good had the egg not been overcooked. It was, in essence, a fried hard boiled egg."

But this year, I visited friends in Las Vegas for New Year's Eve 2015 and had the opportunity to sit outside and watch the fireworks at Serendipity 3 at Caesar's Palace. I really didn't know what to expect but WOW! The view of the strip was perfect. My friends and I could see the fireworks from every angle and the food was to die for! The appetizers just kept coming.There was a pork belly slider that was simply luscious and the lamb chops were amazing. I never expected to have a lamb chop as an appetizer and have it so well made.The demi-glace was so good, and the pesto was the perfect touch. I loved the beet salad with truffle vinaigrette and coconut lime on the tuna tartar. Who would have thought? The drinks and service were excellent. The bartender made me a blueberry mojito that was out of this world. I have to say that next year if anyone is planning on visiting Vegas for New Years, the Serendipity back bar patio is the place to be!!"
