            "review": "Well, I live in Los Angeles and we go to the STK here all the time so when we took a weekender to Vegas we decided to try the STK at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Our reservations were at the opening hour of the restaurant since it was a busy Saturday and we got squeezed in last minute. Upon arrival (10 minutes early for our reservation) we were told by the hostess that the restaurant was CLOSED and she advised us wait OUTSIDE until she opened the doors. REALLY?? There are a ton of lounge chairs inside for patrons waiting to be seated... i.e. US!!! Well we were shocked when we FINALLY walked in to see about 12 people that were enjoying cocktails at the bar inside that had OBVIOUSLY showed up early too... It just ruined our entire meal that this HORRIBLE hostess pulled such a stunt. (btw, STK, this took place on the evening of February 25th, 2012). \nThe ambience was great the music was groovy and the crowd was beautiful like usual, but after being treated like that we were we just really didn't have a great experience.. We will N.E.V.E.R. come back to STK Las Vegas again, in Los Angeles our service HAS always been remarkable, I find it hard to swallow that this little girl would/could treat customers that are willing to pay $80 for a steak in this fashion... I will say that the food was good, but DEFINITELY stay away from the \"seafood platter\" complete letdown.."

It's exactly what you would expect from \"the\" steakhouse in Vegas - loud, good dj playing, pretty people everywhere and $18 cocktails.  The food was great and the sides were large enough for table sharing.  Service is spotty but that's not why youre at STK.  \nAnd since it's a steak house, get the rib eye.  Hands down."

            "review": "I am a superfan of steaks in general. Give me a nice ribeye or porterhouse and I'll be mmm mmm satisfied.\n\nI came here with a group of 12 people for a bachelor party. We were hooked up with a private room, so we didn't have a problem with sound level. You can actually adjust the music volume and the brighness. BTW, the music was a really good mix.\n\nThe service was really excellent. Our busser was in very frequently and our waiters checked-in very often as well.\n\nNow to the food:\n\nI got the 34 oz Cowboy Ribeye with Fois gras topping.\nMaybe it was a mistake getting such a gigantic cut of meat, but what's done is done.\nThe steak has some black char surrounding it. This is very different from any other steak house that I have been to. The char wasn't my favorite but for the larger cuts it does help break up the soft texture of the meat. THe body of the meat was perfectly medium-rare served with two side sauces (one sweeter, one more savory). THe fois gras was delicious and is a DEFINITE must-do, you can't get fois gas in California!\n\nSo yes the steak was great, but the char brought it down. Fois gras topping was excellent.\nPrivate-room made it very comfortable, but I don't think I would have liked it in the main areas.\nService was excellent for the private room.\nBathroom was crazy small, single stall!\n\nI would probably give closer to a 4, but some unusual things (the super char and the bathroom) brought it down for me."

The hostess greeted us with a smile and said we would be seated within 10 minutes and offered us to get a drink at the bar.  They explained they would come get us as soon as the table was ready.  In 10 minutes we were grabbed from the bar and taken to our table.  The music and the customers at the tables throughout the restaurant were jamming to the music and looked to be enjoying themselves.  The service throughout the meal was bar none some of the best and the food is too die for.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a different type of steakhouse."

            "review": "This was a very nice steak house with a live DJ playing music. The place had a classic dark feel, but the   energy was much livelier and younger. It was a perfect fit for the Cosmopolitan hotel (modern, romantic, and young). I would go back to this steak house. \n\nThe order was:\n* Complimentary dinner rolls (5 of 5). I loved their free dinner rolls. Five dough balls were baked together in a small dutch-oven looking little pot. It was fresh and tasted like Hawaiian bread. It was paired with a green butter sauce. I think the sauce was made from green onion or chives. It had a strong green taste, but it was delicious with the fresh dinner rolls. It was a great start to the steak dinner.\n* Tuna tartare (3 of 5) $19 on corn tuille - pecans - avocado. Very fresh tuna tartare on top of a chip. The chip was big enough to hold the tuna tartare, but we had to break it apart to eat it. I am not a fan using a chip to hold tuna tartare. I think it is messy and makes the dish hard to share.\n* Foie gras french toast (3.5 of 5) $24 green apple - almond brioche - sherry gastrique. Tasty, but a little heavy on the syrup. I would also have enjoyed it more, if they considered slicing the apples thinner.  The apples were presented as two chunks and I thought it would have been prettier and easier to eat with the foie gras if it was sliced thinner. I typically think that foie gras appetizers are like pieces of artwork. If you mix and match what is given to you, it enhances the foie gras taste. \n* Hamachi (3 of 5) $16 jalapenos - pear vinaigrette. Fresh, and taste was not memorable. I expected more from the four slices of hamachi.\n* filet 10 oz. (4 of 5) $48 - Tasty and juicy. Nice cut and cooked perfectly to medium rare. No complaints, but at the end, the rib steak was tastier because of the fat content.\n* bone-in rib steak 20 oz. (4 of 5) $49 - Tasty and the bone was so small, it was almost like boneless. This was tasty and juicy.   \n* add on topping foie gras (5 of 5) $15 - What a bang for the buck! This is probably the cheapest add on foie gras price ever and it was a huge piece. Delicious!!!\n* add on side raw horseradish $2 - We were slightly disappointed that the menu asked for $2 for raw horseradish. Nonetheless, we had to order it. \n\nOverall, the place was nice, food was good, and staff was very helpful."

            "review": "STK is located in the Cosmopolitan and dining here is like eating dinner in a straight up club. It's pretty dark, there's a DJ in the corner, scantily dressed girls dancing in the bar, and people even dancing in their chairs. If you don't want to talk to your date, friends, server, etc., but you want to dance in between courses, then I highly recommend STK.  We arrived around 7pm on a Monday night thinking we could just walk in, but we were dead wrong, and didn't get seated until 9:15pm. Pretty insane, but that's Vegas for ya.\n\nAmbiance aside, the food is decent, but pricey. We started with their house made buttery garlic bread, drenched in cilantro oil and bleu cheese, which was delicious and hot upon arrival. Five mins later, it had cooled and became hard as a rock. We both had the skirt steak, cooked a perfect medium rare, and shared sides of foie gras and truffle fries. The foie was super rich, and the truffle fries were cut extremely thick. Overall, we were happy with our meal, but could've done without the long wait and the club-like atmosphere."

Better than most famous steakhouses in NYC.\nThen the chef came over and gave us a complimentary plate of king crab legs, which must have been cooked with butter and some kind of illegal drugs because it was the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. \nAlso: must get the size of jalape\u00f1o grits.\n\nHuge recommendation if you want to have a quality steak dinner in a club atmosphere. \nNote: it is very loud and crowded in here so I do not recommend this to someone looking to have a calm and quiet gathering"

            "review": "I was here during Christmas day with the family because all the Buffet lines in Vegas had 3 hour lines.  Also, we stayed at the Cosmopolitan Hotel.\n\nI had the Sirloin Steak medium size since they are known for their great steaks.  All the steaks come with one side sause.  I had the peppercorn sauce.  Additional sauces are an extra charge.  I must say that the steak was really juicy and tasty.  We ordered two sides for sharing.  One was the sauteed mushrooms which was really tasty and the other one was the spinich was great as well.  The steak also comes with a few vegetables on the side which was decent.\n\nThey also give out fresh bread as an appetizer.  Luckily they ask if you want the Blue Cheese with it because the bread is really stinky with the Blue Cheese and really good without it.  So I recommend no Blue Cheese and just ask it with a side of butter.\n\nService was really good.  Highly recommended."

Reservations book here in advance, so We made\nSure to call ahead of time for our large party. From the first hello to the check, there is a reason why STK is the premier spot in Las Vegas. Just a perfect balance of what you're looking for in Las Vegas. Was fortunate enough to meet the manager Zaban, class act all around. \n\nThanks for everything, from great service to even better food.

The service was lousy, now I am not sure if all the attention was paid to the members of the Seattle Seahawks that were dining there that night or not.  The wait to be seated was not long because we had reservation.  The wait for our food was very long.  The line to the restroom was also long.  The music was extremely loud and inappropriate for children under age...I asked the hostess if that was the norm and she said YES!  There was a smell in the restaurant that was very sickening and we left smelling like that...I won't exactly write them off...I am open to visit another STK in a different city."

I could have eaten just the bread and been happy!\n\nI had the strawberry cobbler martini - delicious. Loved the fresh strawberries and graham cracker crust. \n\nI had a small filet. It was fine, but nothing too special. It was cooked more in the middle than the outside?!\n\nThe sides were delicious. We had the Mac and cheese and potato au gratin. Both were fantastic."

            "review": "It was a little difficult to get a reservation here but I figured that since it was, it may be a great restaurant!  I selected this restaurant because I'm always reading about it on Twitter or Us Mag, etc., and maybe I would get lucky and see a celebrity.  LOL.  Anyhow, we had an early reservation before our Vegas show.  When we got to the Cosmopolitan hotel, we had to go up 3 levels on escalators to get there.  I just felt that the restaurant was part of a mall... not the hotel.  It was kind of awkward seeing all the other restaurants on the same floor, like a Food Court!  We were seated right away and served the baked bread with blue cheese butter and chive oil.  I wasn't a fan but it was okay.  I think its more of an acquired taste.  Our waiter was very nice and gave good recommendations.  We ordered the caesar salad (it's standard for us), which was good.  I had the Filet Medallions and my husband ordered the Skirt Steak with a side of Mac and Cheese (good) and the Mushroom Pot Pie (excellent)!  The dinner was okay, not to die for or anything.  By this time the restaurant was definitely filling up with parties, bachelorette parties, etc., so it was fun to people watch. It was a cool restaurant but I wouldn't rave about the food, its more about the ambiance IMO."

Anyway, ordered the ribeye steak (one of the more expensive steaks in the house) which was very nervy and fatty with very little flavor. One of my other girlfriends did too and had the same to say! The side dishes- mac n cheese and creamed spinach were ok. The mushroom pot pie was pretty good. The feedback from the rest of the group was that the less expensive plates were pretty good. The service was also pretty good and is the reason why I'm giving STK 3 STARS. I don't plan on going back though the next time I'm in Vegas. Gallagher's in New York New York is much better n the prices are comparable."

We all ordered steaks and they were all cooked exactly as we had wanted! The sides were amazing as well! The Mac and Cheese...yumm!!!!

            "review": "I have been wanting to try this place for a while. I casually meander by STK often and finally I found myself inside sitting at a table. Service was prompt and friendly. Food was delicious and semi-creative, for a steakhouse. (I'm looking at you jalape\u00f1o grits.)\n\n We arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation and grabbed some wine at the bar. I don't know why I was shocked at the prices given the location, but I still was. The markup here is downright awful. So if you want to imbibe, be prepared to pay a very high bill. Food was the typical high-end steakhouse on the strip pricing. Although, I did not feel as taken advantage of as I did with the drinks.\n\nI ordered the Market Fish which was risotto with sea scallops topped with caviar (bougie, I know.) Along with that we ordered a few sides, a necessary evil. We got the mac & cheese (which can be prepared truffled or with lobster), the jalape\u00f1o grits, and the broccolini. All were good decisions. The jalape\u00f1o grits stood out to me as being the most original AND delicious. If I could eat a trendy, mini-cast iron of them every night, I'd be living the dream. My entree was decadent and rich. I ALWAYS order scallops if offered to me and I was not let down. Sadly they aren't a permanent item on the menu, although I think they should be. \n\nI docked a star for the alcohol prices, but mainly for the environment. WARNING: Grandma rant. It was way too loud. Now, I understand that we are on the strip, and it's evening, but it's a Tuesday night. Get it together. If it were the weekend, or even a Thursday I would understand the club-vibe. But after a half hour of screaming across the table at my husband, I had to give up. Everything else about this place was spot on."

            "review": "Get ready to get dolled up and have a FABULOUS dinner.  This is by far the best dining experience we've had in Vegas. \n\nMy husband and I love all things foodie (although - we prefer not to refer to ourselves as such, as it makes us feel obnoxious!).  So when we go to Vegas, the main thing we seek out for entertainment is dining at high-end restaurants.  Screw gambling, I'd rather eat my money away than gamble it away. \n\nWe've had some amazing dinners out in Vegas, but this one was by far the best experience we've had, from food to service - all things were on point. \n\nSERVICE:\n\nOur waitress was such a sweetheart, and very knowledgeable about the menu.  She offered some suggestions when we inquired about the menu, and also proposed an order for things to come out.  The timing and order of everything was perfect; we were never bombarded by food, and the wait between courses was never very long.  \n\nThe others on the wait staff were also very attentive.  Our waters were never empty, our tables were always folded if we left to use the bathroom facilities, and any time our cocktails/wine was looking low, there was someone there to offer us another.  \n\nFOOD: \n\nCaesar Salad (4 stars) - Don't know how they did it, but even the Caesar salad was rememberable.  The lettuce was so crisp/fresh, and the dressing and croutons were remarkably tasty.\n\n\n\nSpiced Pickled Prawns (5 stars) - Hands down the best starter/non-beef item of the night.  Actually, ranks right up there with the steak with how much I truly enjoyed this item.  The two are just apples and oranges, so hard to really compare the two. Anyway, I will get this EVERY time I'm here.  The shrimp was perfectly crisp (not the dense/gritty texture that you sometimes find with some shrimp when they've been completely overcooked) and SO fresh.  Also, loved the balance of acidity with the level of heat.  I love heat, so I ended up eating all of the slices of jalapeno pepper it came with (my husband avoided those, and enjoyed his level of heat without them)\n\nLobster Cocktail (3.5 stars) - This was good, but in comparison to everything else, not rememberable.  We would forego this item next time.\n\nBone-in Filet (5 stars) - Holy crap, the star of the night.  Definitely enough steak to split between the two of us.  So amazing, and perfectly cooked to our requested rare-medium/rare.\n\nPork Belly (3 stars)  -  This item came along with the steak and fries toward the end of our meal.  It was delicious, but I wish it had more crispiness (I'm not a huge fan of pork belly unless it's been crisped up just right - the texture of chewy/soft fat makes me want to hurl).  Probably wouldn't order this item again.  Maybe would have \"shined\" a bit more if it wasn't brought out with the steak and fries, who knows.\n\nParmesan Truffle Fries (4.5 stars) - So full of truffle flavor, piping hot, crispy on the outside, and soft in the inside.  A must order for sides.\n\nDRINKS:\n\nDouble Espresso - We rarely do coffee/dessert after dinner, but this one called for it.  The espresso (while very, very spendy!!) was perfection.  Don't think I'd get it again, however, as the price was gasp-worthy (something like $12-15 each for a small little espresso drink).\n\nManhattan - Very well balanced and tasty (per my husband); one complaint is they used a maraschino cherry (i.e., bright red) vs. a gourmet cocktail cherry.  That would have made the cocktail perfection in a glass.\n\nVodka Martini Up w/ Splash of St. Germain - Perfection in a glass; a signature of mine, I've found a lot of places over-do the St. Germain so it's too sweet and not to my liking.  This place nailed it (twice - oops!).\n\nGlass of \"Justin\" Cabernet Savignon to pair with the steak ($4) - We'd tried a bottle of Justin red blend previously (retails around $40-50 a bottle), so we decided to try out the cab.  We were not disappointed, and it paired very nicely with the filet.\n\nOVERALL: \n\nFantastic dinner experience.  An experience indeed.  Will definitely be back; and have also through out the idea of stopping into STK NYC when we're out there next month."

There was a side of...what looked like pickled onions and chives, totally flavorless and the plate could have done without it. \n- Sweet corn pudding - it reminds me of a Filipino dish that was one of my favorites as a child, Maja Blanco. This by far was my favorite thing on the menu."

It's true this place does exists and it's STK. I was a little concerned at first because I heard this steak joint catered to women. I thought to myself \"Oh man, I'm I going to be ridiculed for going to a ladies steak joint\". I later found out why they say that. It's because they offer and serve smaller cuts so that women would be more inclined to eat a steak. They still had larger cuts and the usual hearty sides. The Kobe sliders were amazing though very pricey but worth every dollar. I say this is the closes thing to a meat-meat market I have ever seen and I have to say I enjoyed it all night."

STK looks and sounds more like a club than a restaurant. We discussed abandoning coming here but proceeded because we had waited all night for this reservation. \n\nWe had a reservation for 930 - we show up and are told they are running 20 minutes behind. We inquire what the point of having a reservation is and the hostess just stares blankly back at us. I ask her how we will know when our table is ready and she says\"someone will come find you.\" Mind you, there are so many people congregated by the doorway that I don't think she could find us if she had to. We wait for 30 minutes and watch people come out and watch them head back in. No one appears to actually be leaving. \n\nI head back in and ask her how much longer and she says \"I really don't know - we are waiting for the tables to clear out.\" I push for an estimate of time and she says \"I would guess 20-30 minutes.\" This means on top of my reservation I might have to wait an additional hour!! No thanks. \n\nIf you are looking for a nice dining experience look else where - this place is all about being cool. When I'm hungry I don't care about cool - I want to eat!! \n\nLong story short - we left after 30 min (on top of our reservation) I am not giving hundreds of dollars to a place that doesn't value every customer. No food is worth that. We travel quite a bit and have been to many restaurants and this one took the cake (in a bad way) in the Customer service department. \n\nWould we attempt to come back again (perhaps at a less busy time?!) - NO WAY!!"

I always get the beef carpaccio, beet salad and I'm a sucker for the shrimp cocktail and that's only the starters.  For the main course I would highly recommend the filet mignon as well as the Dover sole.  Don't stop here because you definitely need some side dishes to compliment your dinner.  Do yourself a favor and opt for the truffled Mac n cheese and the sweet corn pudding.  If you have any room for dessert go for the delicious sweet potato donuts..... Yummmmmm.

As we were in Vegas for various birthdays, one of the birthday boys decided the group should have one nice dinner together.  Most of us stayed at the Cosmopolitan.  My friend and I looked at the menu and thought this would be a nice place for dinner.  Knowing that you have to work with a coordinator for any parties over a certain number, I contacted our celebrations contact at the Cosmopolitan who said she'd pass on my information. \n\nGROUP RESERVATIONS:\n*For parties of 13+ guests, you must make a group reservation. I worked with Rose\n*I believe I was put in the Tempest Storm Private Dining Room - $2,000 food/beverage minimum\n*A contract will need to be signed & a credit card will need to be put on file\n*There are 3 set menus to choose from - $85, $100, and $125 options (sides an additional $10)\n*Note: Prices do not include 8.1% tax or 21% service charge\n\nFOOD:\nFrom the set menu I chose the following items:\n*Hearts of Romaine - Good, it's their version of a Caesar Salad.  You may want to ask light on the dressing as mine seemed tossed in dressing and another layer of dressing added on top of that.\n*7oz Skirt Steak - Good with great flavoring and cooked medium rare as I requested.  It was served over mashed potatoes and a couple pieces of asparagus.\n*Molten Chocolate Cake w/Vanilla Ice Cream - Yum! Extremely chocolaty rich and a perfect amount of sweetness to end my meal.\n\nAdditions we ordered:\n*Short Rib Ravioli - Ok. I wish there was more than just shredded short ribs in the ravioli to add a bit more substance to the dish.\n*Mac & Cheese side - Yum! Extremely rich, creamy, and cheesy.\n*Truffle Fries side - A must order!  The fries had the perfect crisp to it and the truffle oil and cheese added a delicious touch!\n\nOne disappointment?  We didn't get candles on the desserts for the birthday boys.\nOh yeah, don't forget to try their bread with the olive oil/chive spread.  It's delicious!\n\nSERVICE:\nAmy aka A Booty (you'd only know if you take a close look at your bill) and Mark were great.  For once I didn't join in with the rest of the lushes and sipped on one glass of wine the entire dinner (hey, someone had to make sure everything went okay).  As my friends ordered and ordered, Mark & Amy were sometimes missing but one of the various servers in our room was more than happy enough to help.\n\nSTK is a hip, modern restaurant with louder than normal music which may make it a bit harder to hear your date.  We had one of the private dining rooms which for whatever reason has padded walls.  The private room was great so we could all hear the speeches we had the birthday boys giving."

Anyhow, with that in mind, read on...\n\nWhile visiting over this past Labor Day weekend, a few friends and I decided to give STK a try.\n\nStymied in deciding what to eat for dinner one day, we went online and found out it was actually Restaurant Week in Las Vegas the weekend we were there.\n\nAfter going through the list of participating restaurants, one of my friends indicated that he always wanted to try STK and that he only heard good things about it.\n\nWe then made a reservation for four and actually planned the rest of our day in getting there on time.\n\nWe were split during the good part of the day, but as the reservation time approached, we started arriving at the Cosmopolitan to go upstairs to the restaurant.\n\nThe service was very professional and it was good to see waiters who can joke around, make good recommendations and still be attentive.\n\nThe funny thing was that I asked the hostess for a Restaurant Week menu all around, but after glancing at the actual dinner menu, we abandoned that pre-fixed menu pretty quickly and went all out.\n\nI ended up getting some filet medallions with bleu cheese spread, and others had the prime rib. Though the portions were on the smaller size (definitely not Lawry's or Mastro's sized), it was well made and actually left you wanting more...which is probably the whole idea behind the smaller portions anyway.\n\nThe brought out our sides on ironcast bowls, which helped keep things hot. The mashed potatoes were really whipped well...to the point of it being almost a thick liquid. It was buttered, which was nice.\n\nOne of the items we got was foie gras to be spread over slices of baguette. I've had foie gras sparingly, but I have to admit that that was pretty good. Good smooth texture and a crunchy bread created a nice combination. It gives that duck-ish aftertaste, but I recommend it, if you don't really mind that. This was one of the better instances of it, and I'm disappointed that California will be placing a ban on serving the delicacy. I suppose I can only really have it if I go back to Las Vegas in the future (which happens often enough, I guess).\n\nThe truffle mac and cheese was okay. I actually used it to clear the palate. It was definitely cheesy, but I felt it lacked a bit of salt or richness.\n\nFor such a classy steakhouse, being in Las Vegas does have its downside. The highlight of the evening had to be leaving STK. As the four of us were walking out, right outside the restaurant was a dude dressed up in only his boxer shorts. Nothing else. I could tell the mater d' and the host staff wanted to say something to the man, like GTFO, but since he wasn't technically inside STK (just outside of it), they couldn't do anything. It was just such a contrast to have this pretty much naked man greeting the well-heeled people entering and leaving the place."

I was just at the Cosmo a few months back and wanted to have the girls have dinner here and enjoy the lounge and atmosphere of STK and the Cosmopolitian. Because I'm a planning nazi, I downloaded the menu and picked out what I was going to get 2 months ahead of time (I'm a little picky). I quickly saw that it was a pricey place, but I checked they YELP reviews and decided it was worth the try. \nWe arrived on time for our reservations and we were asked to wait in the \"lounge\" which was a couple of tables beside the bar that was already taken by other parities that were waiting. We stood around for a brief minute and was ushered to our table on the second level of the restaurant. First thing I have to say is how beautiful this place was. It was hip, artsy, dark colors complimented by white, all that frou frou Cosmo/Vegas stuff. \nWe met our server, Isaac, who was SOOOO GREAT, which is a relief because I was a little worried that since it was so busy that the staff would be subpar on the service front. But Isaac totally showed us that he is excellent at what he does, and my girlfriends loved him! THe food was fantastic, I got the Shrimp Rice Crispies, a few people got steak or tartare. The sides were good too, esp the Lobster Macaroni! YUM! Again, it is a bit pricey but you are paying for the service, food, ambience, and location. \nIf you are visiting the Cosmopolitian with friends, on a date, etc, I would highly recommend going to the Vesper or Chandelier Lounge before dinner and have a drink! Take the time to enjoy the super beautiful hotel! Then have a great dinner at STK!"

It's such a low number of stars to give for such a great meal, expertly served. It means that everything else that STK allowed to happen that night negated any strong points they earned.\n\nWhile waiting for a table, we were witness to such a mind-blowingly disgusting display that it prompted a very serious discussion of our group giving up our reservation altogether, going to In-N-Out Burger (no pun intended), and calling it a night.\n\nAt the table next to us was a man who had obviously called an escort service, had them send a couple of \"workers\" to meet him at STK, and the three of them gave us a floor show of french kissing, gyrating, miming fellatio and cunnilingus, and general dry-humping, that it's a miracle we could keep our steaks down. Management came over (without us even saying anything -- obviously others were bothered, too) and had terse words with the man, which culled the trio's amorous activities -- temporarily, It was only a matter of minutes until they resumed their table-side  menage-a-trois. When they finally left (like the slow fade of a Viagra commercial), our party came to a realization: we were actually *surrounded* by other couples who were very obviously the products of a \"business transaction\" as opposed to.....actual dates. Gorgeous African-American young beauty in skin-tight scuba dress un-zippered to the navel seated with nebbish nerd, to cite an example.\n\nYou bet we're in Vegas. Anything goes. And we're fully up for that. But when the conduct of certain patrons supersedes the comfort of others ponying up significant sums for their Wagyu beef, or the management at STK does not see the slippery slope of cheerfully opening their doors as a clubhouse for the sex trade, they might as well change the theme to Thai Ping-Pong Bar and be done with it. (or -- as it was suggested by some in the party -- change the name to \"STD\"?)  Hepatitis (or worse?)  on the forks is a legitimate but secondary concern:  how about the group of us simply wanting to enjoy a glorious steak at midnight served by a wait staff who really knows their stuff without having to be witness to a Hustler Letter to the Editor in the making?\n\nStop the Ho's at the door.

            "review": "On the evening of May 5, 2016, I visited STK for the 3rd straight year in the month of May as I travel to Las Vegas for the Interop Trade Show. \n\nAs usual, the ambiance was on point, music had the mood set perfectly, it was Cinco de Mayo (which typically I do not celebrate) but what can I say? It was a great day - until my food arrived.\n\nI ordered a Filet Mignon prepared Medium Cajun Style (which adds Cajun Rub on top). Medium is a Pink Warm Center. When the food arrived, I added some sides to it, Confit Potatoes our waitress recommended and asparagus. I tasted the sides on my plate. They were really good. I cut into the Filet. It unfortunately was prepared Medium Well Plus. The waitress understood and replaced the overcooked steak with a Medium prepared Filet Mignon about 6 minutes after I reported the issue. \n\nThe replacement Filet Mignon arrived perfectly prepared on an empty plate. Gone were the sides I had on the plate. I proceeded to eat the remainder sides left from the table that were somewhat on the chilly side as they had been sitting. I enjoyed the steak and my somewhat chilly sides and kept it moving.\n\nIt was a total of 5 Men in our party. 2 White, 1 Mexican, 1 Asian, and I am Black. A diverse crowd - in a good mood because we were scheduled to go to Spearmint Rhino afterwards (Holla!)\n\nAnyhow, we ordered dessert after eating. We ordered the doughnuts with candied walnuts and caramel sauce. It tasted like a gourmet crispy cr\u00e8me without the frosting. It was one of the best desserts I had eaten.\n\nSo why the Meh review? Here's why.\n\n1) I had sides on my plate prior to cutting into my overcooked Filet. Those sides never made it back to my plate with the freshly prepared replacement Filet.\n\n2) The dessert, when presented to us, did not have new silverware. We all received eating dishes and ended up using the same silverware we used for our meals. The dessert was served with no silverware to serve. It also was presented with thick whipped cream that if you turned upside down, did not fall out of its dish. With contaminated silverware from our meals, we could not dip into the whipped cream. We also dug into the doughnuts cautiously since our silverware was not new. We dealt with it. \n\n3) The next table over with 5 couples (10 people) ordered 2 of the same dessert we had. They all received eating dishes and spoons. I thought to myself, here we go.\n\n4) I raised awareness to our server regarding my sides being eliminated from my overcooked Filet plate and the lack of silverware for the dessert. \n\n4a) the waitress indicated that due to food code, food cannot be transferred. I thought great! So why not transfer my sides to a dish at the table until their overcooked food is replaced? She then added, I should have brought out more sides. I thought to myself, Yeah! You Should Have! \n\n4b) the waitress argued with me that the table that received the desserts did not have serving silverware with the doughnuts. I pointed out okay but each person had new silverware (spoons) to use. After which, I stood up and pointed at the table and their new silverware. It took me to do this for her to agree with me.\n\nThe waitress did not deduct ANYTHING off of the $570 bill we accumulated. She indicated that she would educate the servers that brought out the dessert and educate the crew that cleared the entr\u00e9e meals.\n\nWow.. And sarcastically, Good Job. \n\nI'll go somewhere else to dine next time. Our client expensed the full bill. I paid $0 and I was dissatisfied. That tells you the service was less than sub-par.\n\nMy name is Theron. My nickname is Via\nI give legit reviews from my life experiences..\n\n* If a representative from STK wishes to contact me, I can be reached at Seven-One-Four / Six-One-Five -- Seven-Four-Six-Six.\n\n** If I am not contacted, I will be mailing STK a copy of this on stationary letterhead."

He promptly greeted us with a wine list and a smile. Unlike all the other Vegas bartenders who are too concerned about their eyebrows or their pending American Idol audition, Michael actually cared about which glass of wine we ordered and didn't try to convince us to get the over-oaked California cab du jour that the management was pushing. So we sat down and decided to get cozy.\nAfter perusing the menu for a minute, we told Michael to pick out some of his favorites. The secret is... the people that work there always know what's best. We're hungry. While we waited, Michael introduced us to some of the other bar staff and guests. While we ate yummy, warm blue cheese bread we talked to young, sexy people, listened to fun music and ordered more drinks. \nThe food arrives. Carnivore heaven. The centerpiece was a bone-in ribeye, sliced to share. Side of bearnaise. Parmeasan fries. Spiced carrots? Who would have thought spiced carrots? Utterly, ridiculously good. Everything was SO good.  Only problem was that there wasn't MORE. \nNo dessert, just more drinks. Come here if you like to have fun and have a good time. You just might like it. Michael and the bar staff were amazing, unforgettable. Thank you. Can't wait to come back.\nCigarette please."

            "review": "Friend of mine and I ate at STK last Sunday in LV.  Other friends we were traveling with opted to catch a Beatles show elsewhere in town, and after hearing their \"review\" of that show, I know my friend and I had the better evening.\n\nTwo guys at a steakhouse for dinner, so it stays pretty basic:  drinks, salads, steaks and a few sides.  It was ALL GOOD at this place.  I'll admit to having some reservations based on prior reviews regarding the noise level in the restaurant, and am very pleased to say we didn't experience that at all.  Maybe those running STK have read the reviews and toned it down?  Granted it was a Sunday night, but it didn't seem like either the Cosmopolitan hotel or STK restaurant was particularly jumpin' that night.  We got a table right away, and were able to carry on a normal conversation throughout the dinner.\n\nI started with the wedge salad while my friend had some kind of bibb lettuce roll-up special, and they were both good.  A pleasing amount of bleu cheese in my wedge, which I think is the perfect setup for our steak entrees that followed.  I had a large NY Strip steak, cooked perfectly medium rare, which my friend opted for short ribs, which he said were fantastic.  Our two sides were also terrific, a dish of sauteed spinach and another side of fingerling potatoes roasted in garlic.  I know the potatoes were all gone before we left the table, while there was some spinach left, but think that was more because our appetites were satisfied than anything else.\n\nCouple of dirty martini's with bleu cheese stuffed olives over the course of the evening, and we were quite happy.  My friend picked up the tab so I didn't see the final tally, but I'd estimate easily $100 - $150 each, as I think everything was ala carte.  But I'd go to this place again in a heartbeat, next time in Vegas."

It had a very modern with a touch of sophistication feel. \n\nI'm giving this restaurant a 1 star because I got food poisoning, which was a real shame because the sides were excellent. \n\nMy two friends and I started with freshly baked bread in a mini cast iron pot, covered in bleu cheese butter with a chive-olive oil sauce. Amazing! \n\nWe skipped the appetizer because we didn't want to fill up before our steaks came. \n\nI ordered a 10 oz filet, medium-rare with foie gras on top. The filet was pretty tough and it was hard to cut into. It which I found odd for a filet, but it was cooked correctly (med-rare). The foie gras was OK - only 'OK' because I was expecting a nice buttery, melt in your mouth kind of texture; and frankly, this wasn't it. \n\nAs for sides: \\\n- the creamy mash potatoes were standard.\n- the Brussels sprouts were fabulous. It had small chunks of bacon which gave it a step in front of the game. \n\nToo bad it didn't all get digested. The next morning, I woke up puking everything back up, as well as it was coming out the behind from diarrhea. The only thing I can think of was food poisoning from either the steak or foie gras because I shared everything else with my two friends and they were just fine. It was a miserable 36 hours, which included going  to the bathroom every 30 min. in the first 24 hours. AND I had to fly back home to San Jose, Ca in between bathroom breaks. \n\nI'm sorry if I was too harsh on this. But the fact that I got soo sick  tells me the standards for this restaurant (located in the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas) was not prestige nor up to par. It was the worst ... and i mean THE WORST... food poisoning experience I've ever had."

The  waitress was very sweet, but kind of slow when it came to taking orders. The food, however came out exceptionally quick. Music was pumping a killer mix, but too loud to have any sort of conversation. Hubby and I are foodies so we opted to try a bunch of small plates. The only one noteworthy was the squash risotto. It was divine! All the others were sub par, just the basic nothing special but not bad. The price tag however was insane and left still hungry. The oysters were the smallest I've ever seen, and for $18 a half dozen I felt ripped off. The Cosmo is a very cool, trendy casino but with that comes over priced restaurants and lots of people trying too hard. I was psyched about this place and its reviews, but it's so not something I'd be trying again. Still on the search for a perfect foodie location while in this town. 2 stars the expedited service and risotto only."

In addition to his great personality, he helped my friend order something that was gluten free.\n\nWe started with the Lil BGRs and they were delicious!! It comes with two, so it's a nice, small appetizer to share. For dinner, I ordered a special they had. It was a natural fllet mignon (I think that's the term they used) and it was oscar style. I also had to try the lobster mac and cheese because STK's twitter account said it was the most popular side dish. It was very good! I'm not big on seafood so I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I did. The only downside, it's not good as a leftover. I don't know if it was the plastic to go container or what but when I tried to have it later, it wasn't good and had a strong seafood smell to it.\n\nAtmosphere is nice...dim and pretty. The design of the restaurant is actually what made me want to try the restaurant in the first place! My only complaint is how loud the music is.

There is an in house DJ and it gets pretty loud in the restaurant. So if you're thinking first date, maybe not. Ordered the cowboy rib steak 34 oz. mash potatoes and mac and cheese and the doughnuts. The sides can be shared as it is enough for two. My friends ordered a bunch of sides and we all shared. So the items that stood out for me were the complimentary bread, the truffle fries and jalape\u00f1o grits. The cowboy rib steak was not good. The steak lacked in flavor and it didn't wow me. I was pretty sad about that because I was hoping for an amazing juicy buttery dish. Honestly, the sides and that bread was amazing. So the doughnuts aren't consistent. We ordered two orders of the doughnuts. One was super oily and one was amazing! Overall, I didn't think STK lived up to to all of their hype."

Unless someone was looking at me when they spoke, I could not understand/hear a thing they were saying. On the bright side, great music! Food is good. I ordered the hearts of romaine salad, followed by the free range chicken: both were good, not great. The Oreo cheesecake was way too sweet for my taste. I ordered the knockout punch cocktail: at $18, I was less than impressed and can say it was underwhelming. When I perused the wine list, the prices of the wines were significantly overpriced, even by the glass. \nOverall, cool place with great music. On the downside, very expensive with average quality food and overpriced alcoholic beverages. Also, this is not a place for people that want to get to know each other or have a conversation. It was ok. I would not run back anytime soon, yet would consider going back if there was a special with lower prices. There are way too many way better restaurants in Vegas with better food of the same category, so it does not make sense for me to pay so much for what I consider good but not great food."

The seafood is fresh, specialty cocktails are made with care & the steaks are cooked to perfection! \n\nThere is a DJ right by the bar and it really adds to the great atmosphere. I have (almost ) tried everything on the menu and can happily recommend: \n\nTuna Tartar: Highest grade of tuna\nSeafood Platter: Freshest ever! Coming from Miami I am a seafood snob and this platter always surpasses my expectations! \nDover Sole: The brown butter sauce is A+++\nBone-In Filet: Lean yet flavorful\nTruffle Fries: Thick cut so different from other restaurants \nLobster Mashed Potatoes: Self explanatory as to why these are a must\nSweet Potato Donuts: Made fresh and melt in your mouth :)  \n\nWhat really makes STK stand out from most restaurants is that the management touches base with the tables. For such a busy restaurant to do this is nothing short of amazing and such attention to detail is what keeps me coming back for more. \n\nThrow on a cute dress, grab your girlfriends (or significant other) and treat yourself to a night at STK. Order the Cucumber Stiletto, people watch, and enjoy a filet; you'll thank me later!"

We were greeted right away by our server, Chris, who gave us a crash course in the menu and offered a few recommendations. Chris was knowledgable and very personable, and his expert service was nothing less than exceptional.\n\nTo start, I enjoyed the beet and arugula salad which was wonderful and finished the course with their 20oz bone-in ribeye (med rare, of course) topped with bacon butter, because why would you not? Happily sampled a bit of my friends skirt steak as well which was likewise, outstanding. Oh! And a quick side note; if you're a manhattan drinker, you'll be pleased to know they carry Carpano Antica... And yes, it absolutely matters.\n\nAnyway, I only visit Las Vegas once or twice a year but I'm pleased to say with certainty that I will be coming back to STK.\n\nSo, a quick recap?\n\nAmbiance - 10\nFood - 10\nService - 11 (We were a five top and water glasses not ONCE went empty.)\n\nIn short, STK comes with just about my highest recommendation. Well done."

It was light and fresh and the melon added a very unique and delicious element to the crab. A must try!\n\n- Beef Carpaccio: (special of the night) Thin slices of beef, shaved parmesan cheese and a balsamic drizzle - Melt in your mouth delicious! The balsamic balanced the saltiness of the parmesan cheese.\n\n- Wagyu Filet: (special of the night) - Medium, and cooked to perfection! The crustiness of the outside was a great compliment to the tenderness of the inside.\n\n- Chilean Sea Bass (special of the night) - The sea bass was perfectly flakey and laid on a bed of wild mushrooms. \n\n- Mushroom Pot Pie - This was DIVINE! The textures of wild mushrooms and the cream sauce was great with the crustiness of the pie shell.\n\n- Mac and Cheese - I have to admit, I didn't think this would be very special, but to my surprise, it was phenomenal! It came out with a bread crumb/cheese crust and because I'm big on \"texture,\" the creamy, cheesy shells were a great balance.\n\n- Bread Pudding - Rich and Decadent! The best part were these little crunchy things added on top. They looked and tasted like Cap N Crunch cereal :)\n\nService was top-notch and we were treated like royalty!"

Practically had to scream to talk. As I'm reading other yelp reviews looks like STK DOES NOT HONOR RESERVATIONS, like they didn't honor mine.\n\nFood: \n5/5 Skirt Steak 7oz.- Surprisingly my girls think I'm weird because I actually really skirt steak, if its cut right. Medium rare with a nice sear. Super juicy and flavorful. Yummy\n1/5 Bone in Rib Steak 20oz.- I didn't really care for this, It was delicious but a little tough. A lot tougher than the skirt steak which is surprising. \n\nSides:\n1/5 Asparagus- not sure if this was cooked properly but It tasted a little cold. \n2/5 Parmesan Truffle Fries- Very Fluffy and yummy but it had a strong over powering taste of garlic powder. Totally ruined it. \n\nService:\nHORRIBLE!!! 0/5\nWe had reservations at 11pm, I understand they close at 12am so you would think they would want to seat us right away and take our order, NO. The hostess kept us waiting telling us our table wasn't ready. Finally seated at 11:30pm, I wasn't going to rush for them but wow no server no introductions, no water or drinks offered.

Obviously a meal this fantastic isn't cheap, but it was worth it, since we weren't hitting places like this every night.  We were able to score a prime table (thanks to my friend) and was immediately greeted.  We chose a nice bottle of wine, and off we went.  Everyone at the table ordered a petite filet, which was the perfect amount for a girl.  I've heard rave reviews about the bone in rib eye, but with all the sides we ordered, I just couldn't.  We also ordered the asparagus, creamed corn and mac and cheese with truffle and lobster.   The mac and cheese was the real star, absolutely mouth watering, and served in a cast iron skillet.  Coming from the South, this mac and cheese is in my top 3 easily.  Creamed corn was also very very tasty.  Service was outstanding, as I never wanted for anything.  Also, what I really liked about STK was the music.  This is the only restaurant I've ever experienced that I didn't know if I should eat or dance.  The DJ that was spinning was really really great.  STK is packed full of beautiful people just like the Cosmopolitan, so with the great food, great wine, kicking music and eye candy, your dining experience is complete!"

My dining partner, who's much more of a foodie than I (don't get me wrong, i love great food), remarked that her filet mignon was probably the best she had in a while. I would go again and again if I could, but I don't make it to Vegas often. Not to mention, I wouldn't be guaranteed to have Sarah as my server, which is a must. Too bad they can't all be like her.

The DJ did a solid job mixing it up while we were there. The music being played parallels that of the clubs in the vicinity. The interior and the decor of the restaurant itself was modern and chic. \n\nThe menu offered a variety of choices all depending on your appetite. The filets (7 oz. & 10 oz.) were cooked perfectly and well seasoned. We ordered the mac & cheese and yukon potatoes as side dishes and were not disappointed with either. I recommend those sides over some of the others, especially the broccolini. The table next to us ordered it and it looked weak. Skip on an appetizer and snack on their great with chive olive oil. It was a pleasant surprise.\n\nDessert is not to be skipped. Their bread pudding with salted caramel ice cream, covered with Captain Crunch was a perfect end to the meal...and I'm not even a fan of bread pudding.\n\nFYI the busboys and waiter worked their asses off throughout the meal. \n\nThe not so good...\n\nThey have a MASSIVE wine menu. The type that will make you wish you had a Cliff Notes version of it. The wine list was not the issue, their lack of quality beer was. Their offerings included the usual watery light beers and my choice for the night Sam Adams Boston Lager. I have nothing against Sam, I actually enjoy it very much so, but I was underwhelmed with the lack of attention the beer selection received in their menu. Craft beer is turning into what wine was years back and I was surprised their menu did not convey that.\n\nThe bathroom situation isn't ideal. It is a one-at-a-time procedure and the unisex line can get crowded. The bathroom hall monitor loudly lets you know when someone has left the bathroom in case you happened to slip out of consciousness and need assistance.\n\nBottom line, will I eat there again when in Las Vegas? Answer, yes."

We were told that the room could only accommodate 16 guests (which was the size of our party)... they probably should have scaled the maximum down to 12 - we literally were sitting elbow to elbow, with a couple people actually sitting at the corners of the rectangular table.\n\nService was very attentive while we were in the room, and we were able to adjust the volume of the music (which was good, as in the regular dining room the music was on the level of techno club blaring), as well as the temperature.\n\nOn the whole, the food was very good.  We started with several trays of cold seafood - jumbo prawns, chilled lobster, and raw oysters.  Everything was very very fresh.  I had the king crab salad with with melon, mache, and i believe some grapefruit.  It was beautifully presented, but in terms of taste, just okay -  strangely a little on the salty side with not much actual crab flavor.  I ordered the 10 oz. filet with truffle butter, cooked a perfect medium rare.  We all ordered different sides, and so I got to try a whole variety of them - some of my favorites were the mac and cheese, mashed potatoes with lobster, mushroom pot pie, and the garlic truffle fries.  We went through several bottles of good wine (I sampled some chardonnays and a couple cabs), and I ended the meal with an incredibly flavorful mango sorbet, which was the perfect finish to such a large meal.\n\nOverall, I would give STK a 3.5 rating -- the food is very good for the most part, although it is definitely on the pricier side.  The service is attentive as well, however the ambiance of the restaurant overall is a little strange (although I guess it IS Vegas).  I would recommend for a party of 8-10 (to snag a private room, but have enough room to eat without having to sit on top of your neighbor) - I can't imagine being able to have any sort of conversation out in the regular dining room since the music was blaring so loud."

            "review": "Went here on a business trip with 8 others.  Probably the loudest \"nice steakhouse\" I've ever been to...  and they said it was fairly calm as it was only a Wednesday night.  The funny thing was that we all agreed the noise became less noticeable as we got drunker lol.  But, if I'm going to a nice place, I'd prefer it to be a place where I can at least hear the people with me.  \n\nDrinks and wine were great.  We had the seafood platter appetizer which was the best I've ever had.  Jumbo Shrimp, crab legs, crab, claws, lobster, oysters, and some other stuff.  This was the highlight of the evening for me.  \n\nI ordered the Cowboy Ribeye.  I have to say I was a little disappointed in the cut of meat.  I mean, it was huge and it was cooked well, but, for an $85 steak, I expect prime quality.  This did not taste \"prime\" to me.  This is the only part of the night (besides the noise possibly) that keeps STK from getting 5 stars from me.  It cold be that a steak this large is tougher to find \"prime\" quality?  Not sure, I might advise trying the medium cut and seeing if that's any better.  \n\nOverall, very good experience though.  A little pricey for me as our total bill came to over $2k for 9 people, but, had a nice time nonetheless.  (Luckily our company paid for it.)  To me, it wasn't worth  $225 per person, probably more like $150-$175 range.  But, then again, we did drink quite a bit.  \n\nAlso, I have to say that the service was top-notch.  They had 1 main waiter and 2 other people taking care of us.  They did a great job.\n\nOne other semi-annoying thing was that they only have 1 single restroom for men and women.  2 stalls for the entire restaurant.  This seems absurd to me.  As I said at the start, they told us it was a quiet night for the place...  But, there was still a line every time I had to use the restroom (which was quite often as we were \"indulging\").  I can't imagine the lines on a weekend."

We asked for the sliders well done they came out almost raw. One of the food runners was a little testy with us. The sides are ridiculously small even compared to other high-end restaurants like Mastro's. \n\nThe one thing that makes STK stand apart is the DJ. Its. super entertaining....makes for an awesome atmosphere ,would probably go back for drinks just for that. \n\nI really like the manager Clayton of the Las Vegas location super cool guy came over to the table to make sure everything was great."

She knew the menu very well and was very helpful!\n\nThe food was excellent!!! Even though I like my steak well done, it just melted in my mouth.

I had the ribeye and thought it was good, but it didn't blow me away.  From the sounds of everyone else, they enjoyed their food a lot more than I did.  The house bread was great, I tried a salad that was very good, but the steak itself just wasn't anything to write home about.\n\nOn top of that, the restaurant had a club-like atmosphere with a DJ spinning some pretty good tracks, people were dancing, and I even saw sparklers when someone bought a bottle.  I gotta say it's weird when you're trying to eat a meal and talk to your friends to be yelling.  That said, this would be a great spot to go to if you were looking to party with your friends but didn't want the crowds and super overpriced drinks of a club.\n\nProbably won't be back anytime soon, but I don't think I'm STK's target market."

If we had anyone else it wouldn't have been the same.  I work in F&B and would hire him in a heart beat!\n\nWe started off with a nice bottle of Chardonnay.  We were given the bread which had a nice bleu cheese spread on it, not too much, just right!  This came with some oil for dipping.  We also had the beef tartar & borracha salad.  The cheese on the salad was to die for.  The beef tartar was good but not the best I've ever had.  The server did inform me that the Carpaccio is a better choice but I don't like Carpaccio's as much.\n\nWe then had our entree's.  I tried the special which was a 7oz filet w/ crab & asparagus.  It was prepared to my liking, medium rare and the flavor was excellent.  I also got a side of b\u00e9arnaise.  My company got the fish on the menu which she loved.  We shared the truffle mac and cheese which was top notch as well.\n\nPaul was very attentive during the entire meal.  He asked for our names and addressed us by them during the meal.  He was an honest server and didn't just say that everything was great however when he knew of a similar but better dish he offered that which is a wonderful quality.\n\nWe finished with the donuts which was a recommendation from the server.\n\nI 100% will dine again at STK and ask for Paul.  Even overhearing the server at the table next to us their experience was so different.  \n\nThe environment is ambient and perfect for any special occasion or just a business dinner.  The only thing I disliked was that there was a bathroom attendant.  Being a female I don't really care for you to stand there and open the door to the restroom for me.  I expect that in a nightclub but not in a restaurant."

We stood at the front while the hostesses chatted amongst themselves and completely ignored us. When a different friend suggested that we go back for starters before our reservation at Jaleo, I was hesitant. \n\nI am not a huge fan of supper clubs either and that played into my distaste for this place. When I am at dinner, I generally don't like having to scream across the table to talk to my friends. With that statement being said, I had a great time here. The DJ that night was spinning 90's R&B and I was hooked. \n\nWhen we got there, we were seated right away this time on the high top tables near the bar. The service was a little slow at the beginning, but all our needs were taken care of. The four of us ordered; shortrib agnolotti with kabucha, steak tartar, crispy shrimp with a spicy bisque, beef carpaccio, and the beet salad.\n\nOverall, the food is decent. The best item was the beet salad. It is not a knock to the other items, but the greens were just that good. I love beets and am glad to see them make an appearance on many menus nowadays. The agnolotti were also wonderful. The stuffed pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente. The sauce is reduced to caramel consistency and retained all the flavor of the beef. Out of the raw dishes, the carpaccio was better. The pesto tossed noodles on top was a splendid pairing. I've had better tartars on the Strip, so I would skip that next time. The bisque for the shrimp had a nice flavor to it and would be great for a cold day. \n\nNow, would this be my first choice for dinner? No, but I would not oppose returning."

We had to wait for half an hour for the NOT amazing food! We ordered 7 steaks and 3 of them were overcooked. We ordered medium rare but they came out with almost well, they were so dry! We told the server, she took them back to the kitchen and gave us new ones.  The second time, they gave us rare (but we want medium rare), meat were still cold inside! Super disappointing!!!!!! Totally NOT worth that price! \n\nFor side orders, wild mushrooms, mac and cheese, mushroom hot pie were good with no suprise. For the asparagus, they were just plain! I think they just boiled the asparagus with water then put several drips of something like soy sauce on top. They didn't even grill them or putting some seasoning on. And it costs $12! \n\nWe went with all excitements after reading all those good reviews. After this experience, I WON'T go back for sure."

She had a great time at the STK in New York a couple weeks ago and wanted to check out this one. \n\nMaybe I'm just getting old but I hated it overall. Music was so loud I could barely hear my friend right next to me and couldn't hear a word our server said. I get that they're going for a fun atmosphere, but it's a restaurant not a club. I go to nice overpriced dinners to enjoy my friends company, not listen to blasting hip hop and the drunk douchebags next to me. \n\nPetite filet, mac & cheese and corn pudding (creamed corn) were good, but not exceptional - you can get the exact same meal at any steakhouse in Vegas. Probably for a little less.  Cocktails were good but not worth $18-22/drink. \n\nAvoid the foie grass French toast appetizer - love them separately but the flavors together with cooked apples is a big fail. Especially after factoring in the ridiculous $24 price tag.\n\nReally mediocre service from the Asian dude server too - we had to ask for the wine list and saw him 4 times - took order, brought wine list, took drink orders, brought check. Not sure if there were no specials or he didn't feel like telling us. To be fair, maybe he's just accepted the fact that nobody can hear what the eff he's saying because of the music. \n\nMastro's next door in Crystals is so much better then this place - classy and beautiful restaurant, exceptional service and food. It's not stuffy so you can still have a good time there. But if you're wanting to be a loud obnoxious group, please go to STK where you'll fit in with the crowd."

When we got to the restaurant, the first thing we noticed was the very chic vibe, hip music, and dim lighting. The energy in STK was very fun and exciting. We were seated shortly after arriving, but the first thing that came to our attention was the very cramped seating arrangements. My boyfriend was very uncomfortable since the tables were set very low (his knees easily hit underneath the table making any movement difficult). \n\nWe decided to start the night off with two glasses of Pinot Noir after noticing that the wine menu was extremely limited, which definitely surprised me. We then asked our waiter if he would take a picture of us, and he rudely told us he would do it later. The service was not up to par to say the least. \n\nI ordered the Filet with King Crab Oscar. My filet was really good, but it was definitely not the best I've had. For sides, we ordered Bok Choy and Mac and Cheese with lobster. The Bok Choy had a nice, salty flavor; however, it was way too chewy to enjoy. The Mac and Cheese was probably some of the worst I've ever had. The flavor was horrible and there was one piece of lobster in entirety. \n\nMy boyfriend's Bone in Filet was very fatty once he got closer to the bone. He did like the flavor, but only half of the filet was edible due to all of the fat. \n\nAfter dinner, we ordered more wine, along with cappuccinos and our waiter couldn't have been more thrilled to see that he had to continue serving us. He was pretty pissed. \n\nI won't be in a hurry to return. It seemed that the workers were more worried about dancing and talking to each other than serving their diners. \n\nHighly overrated!"

I think you have to be have to be ready to party when you come here. The bar area had a very social feel which was nice to have before sitting. We went there since our \"table wasn't ready\" but I think its by design to get us to grab some drinks at the bar before sitting. I say that because when we sat down there was a few open tables that appeared to not be filled for awhile. Our server was fast and on point with good knowledge of the menu. My ribeye was cooked to my medium rear liking with a nice sear on  the outside just like I like it. Mashed potatos were fantastic. They did under cook one person at our tables filet mignon, but he was too polite to send it back to be cooked longer. Steakhouse usually error on that side so they can always throw it in longer. The point off for the visit was strictly because they didn't serve prime steak, but charged \"prime\" prices. The steaks were angus though a very tasty! I'm going to Orlando in March and hope to eat at their new place down there too!"

It's a fun, cool vibe if you are having dinner or drinks with friends. The music is always on point, but extremely loud, so if you're looking for an intimate quiet date night, this probably wouldn't be the place for you. The first time I went here, the food was good and a gf and I shared the medium sized ribeye which was cooked perfectly from what I can remember. The whole group of 6 girls shared about 3 or 4 different sides which were more than enough. \nThe second time I went here though, the experience was not at all the same. Since we came with guys this time, I was going to share the cowboy ribeye which is on the larger side. The waitress told us it would be a bit of a wait of about 30-45 mins since the cut was thicker, but said she would tell them to rush the order so the food would come out the same time as the rest of our group. We told her we didn't mind waiting, and we understood it may take longer. The food arrived....all at the same time. Now that wouldn't be a problem normally, but when I got my steak which I ordered to be cooked medium, the inside was ok, but the outside was COMPLETELY burnt, like I mean, charcoal burnt! When we ate it, I couldn't even taste the flavor of the steak, all I could taste was charcoal...bleh! Even my friend who likes burnt food, actually couldn't take it anymore. We realized after, that they were about an hour from closing time and were rushing to get the orders out. An hour to closing when I got my food, not when I put my order in btw. I mean, if I'm going to pay $85 for the steak alone, please take your time and cook it correctly! That left a bad taste in my mouth (literally) so I probably won't be making a trip back. I did leave 3 stars since my first experience wasn't as horrible, our server was super friendly this time, and the creamed corn was REALLY good! However, for a place that specializes in steak, they need to make that their priority."

The hostess sits you in round booths that are so close to your neighbor by the end of the night you might have new friends. You order a round of their signature cocktails and soak in the glitz and the glam. But is it worth all the hype and the $$$? \n\nService - Our waitress was awesome. She was very detailed when going over the menu (maybe a little too much) and was more than obliged to offer her recommendations. She was on top of her game and provided excellent service to our table. I was a little intimidated by the bussers as they were like vultures as soon as you finished a dish. They also swooped in to fold the napkin on the table everytime my date got up from the table. Side note: Just make sure to say you ordered sparkling water so they don't pour regular tap water when they see your glass almost empty. Tap & Sparkling do not mix well.\n\nFood - Within minutes of being sat down, you are greeted with a complimentary Parmesan Garlic Roll and it's dipping oil, which I can't remember what it was off the top of my head. The roll wasn't bad. \n\nWe order our cocktails and appetizers - Tuna Tartare & Foie Gras French Toast. Phenomenal! Both were so refreshing and hit that palate perfectly. The Tuna Tartare was fresh with diced jalapenos, onions and lime in a taco shell with a avocado puree and chili oil. The Foie Gras French Toast was balanced excellently. The toast in a sherry reduction and the foie gras perfectly cooked, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a poached apple made happy time in my mouth! I highly recommend these two apps. \n\nWe then ordered a medium rare bone-in fillet with a side of Parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and steamed Alaskan crab legs. The fries were not like the usual shoestring fries you find around town, they were more like steak potato blocks, not bad if I say so myself. The mushroom pot pie is good for mushroom fiends. They bring it out as a pot pie and cut the top off and dump the filling on a plate for you. The Alaskan crab legs were nicely plump and sweet, oh how I miss the Northwest! \n\nNow for the main entree- for being a steakhouse I was disappointed that their steak did not live up to the hype. It was cooked perfectly but had no flavor! A little salt & pepper would have made it one of the top steaks in town. Maybe the reason it's so bland is because they do give you an option to add a topping or sauce to your steak. However, I'm a purist and great steak doesn't need anything fancy on it if seasoned right. The waitress brought us their steak sauces to try and honestly I wasn't impressed by them. The flavor was so bland. The mushroom & peppercorn sauce was probably the better of the 4 but it still lacked flavor. Word of advice don't order the mac & cheese, no flavor whatsoever. I couldn't tell you if it was suppose to be a truffle mac & cheese or just a white mac & cheese (Best Mac & Cheese: StripSteak's truffle mac & cheese). \n\nWait still not done! We had to top off the night with dessert to have the whole STK experience. We ordered a molten chocolate cake and the famous bread pudding. If you have a sweet tooth, these two desserts will rock your world. I did like the bread pudding but it was a little too sweet for me as it was drenched in the caramel syrup. The Captain Crunch addition to the bread pudding was quite interesting. \n\nWhen all was said and done, we got are bill and walked away stuffed. We easily spent over $200 for the 2 of us but we also wanted to have the full STK experience. Overall, a cool place to be if you don't mind the loudness, dark lighting and have a couple hours to kill...our dinner lasted over 2 hours. \n\nSide notes:  The timing between apps and entrees seemed so spread out. I feel like we waited 15-20 for our entree to come out, could be a bad thing if you're starving. The steak was a disappointment but willing to try it again or try something else. Be prepared to wait in line to use the restroom as there is only one stall per gender. Make reservations as it can get crowded."

When they said \"not your daddy's steak house\", what they should have said is we got rid of all the good stuff from your daddy's steak house and kept all the bad.\n\nYes it has a sexy vibe, after all the hostess staff and female bar staff will remind you of Coyote Ugly, you have club music playing at club decibels and its dark.  What this means to you, is bartenders with attitude, hostesses that only pay attention to the men in your group and an envirnoment so loud you can't hold a conversation.\n\nThe saving grace was our server and the food.  Our server was top notch and very personable, the food was good, but not good enough to put myself through that experience again.  The manager could care less about his hostesses behavior, there were no apologies just excuses and he even lied to us.\n\nIf you have to entertain your in-laws and you HATE holding a conversation with them, then this is the place to be.  You can easily ignore them through the meal because you can honestly tell them you can't hear a word they are saying and eat in peace (as long as you can ignore the hear shattering music).  Also bring your ones with you when you use the bathroom and when I say bathroom I mean as in ONE AND ONLY ONE stall per ladies and one for men.  Get ready to wait in line or you have to leave the restaurant to use one.\n\nIf you STILL want to come to STK make sure you have the truffle mac n cheese."

Partly because the restaurant was located in the convenience of our hotel, the Cosmo. Atmosphere was tame, noone was obviously drunk or falling out of their seat. The night was off to a good start. All of the waitstaff were gorgeous, including our busboy, who got shamelessly hit on by several of the girls at our table. No not me. I was focused on the food, which was amazing. Our server was prompt with our drink orders and complimentary bread for the table (out of this world good!) It had chive butter melted on the side. I ate so much I was not too hungry so only ordered the tuna tartare appetizer and romaine salad. That was the perfect amount of food though and the tuna was awesome. The salad tasted like it had caesar dressing which I love so it was all good. Other favorite dishes at the table were the crab legs and shrimp rice crispies. If I came back I would probably stick with the tuna again but get the pear/walnut salad."

I have been to the one in New York, ate an amazing meal and then transferred from my romantic table overlooking the river, to the bar on the roof top as the seemingly well mannered steakhouse transforms into a fantastic fun time for grownup night life! And this \"restaurant is a rockin', if you have $$ please come-a-knockin\" attitude fits in perfectly for Las Vegas as well as the delightfully raucous and refined Cosmo! \n\nIs it as good as NY? Nothing in LV ever is, but I will say, it comes close! The food is what you expect from an STK, expensive but worth it for a memorable night out. The music is loud and infectious. Half the people are eating, half are drinking and everyone feels like they are in the midst of a hell-of-a party!"

I gave STK Las Vegas 3 Stars ONLY because I'm such a huge fan of the one in LA but I have to say I was very disappointed at my dinner at this location.  My husband and I frequent the one in LA and ALWAYS receive excellent service and the food is amazing so we decided to go to the one in LV for our anniversary and were extremely disappointed.  We waited for our table for almost a 1/2 hour with reservations and that wasn't such a huge deal because the restaurant is super fun with a DJ and happy partying people from Vegas but our wait was so in vain as we were seated in the very back of the restaurant near the kitchen. Again, I wouldn't have really thought much about it but I saw the Hostess seat at least three parties that came after us at nice tables before she sat us and it felt deliberate! What is this 1959 where you seat the colored people in the back by the kitchen? I was not a happy camper but so as to not completely ruin my anniversary dinner with a big nasty attitude, I just tossed back a couple of strong drinks back and made the best of it.  I was hoping our dinner would make me forget all about the Hostess segregating us in the back but to my disappointment, the food was really just OK!  I can't imagine how the same dishes can taste so different but they paled in comparison to what we're used to savoring at the LA STK.  Lastly, they did not acknowledge the special occasion note that it was our anniversary.  My husband had to remind them but they did then bring us a pretty yummy Bread Pudding!\n\nWould I recommend this place you ask?  Absolutely because its in the Cosmopolitan Hotel (check), plays awesome music (check), has decent drinks (check) and the food is edible."

We both ordered a filet medium rare with au poivre and blue butter sauce. We shared the Yukon gold potatoes and Mac and cheese. It was all delicious. The atmosphere was fun, there was an older group of guys at the table next to us that mingled with a older group of women celebrating a 40th birthday. As the night progressed the table of men and women ended up sitting together and started dancing in the middle of the restaurant. It was fun to people watch. The servers were professional and attentive. The restaurant had a DJ playing music that made it fun. The location is inside the Cosmopolitan which makes the walk to STK entertaining. The Cosmo is gorgeous. STK was memorable and delicious. I would recommend this place to others. The crowd this nights was in the 30-40 age range."

First, the place was loud and dark, and frankly, pretentious.  Secondly, the food took quite some time to come out and when it did, let's just say I've had better Rib Eye at most other steak houses I've been to.  Really nothing much to rave about here.\nWhat really got me upset was the service and how they screwed that up royally.  Since the meal was covered with casino dining credits, I tipped out of my own pocket.  $100 for a $500 meal seems reasonable.. until I realized I was charged $200.  When I called the STK to correct this and provided my receipt as proof, apparently I was told this error in credit card billing has happened before and they can't do much about it.  After a few days of dealing with the manager who's quite hard to get a hold of, I finally just said screw it and left it with my credit card to deal with.  With many other steak houses available on the strip, I don't anticipate coming back here anytime soon."

It is not as big as the Miami location, so the lounge/bar area is basically in the same area as the dining/eating area. \n\nGenerally, the LV STK is fun on Mondays for Industry Night, but people don't usually eat. It's more of a drinking, social event. To mix it up, we came to the LV STK with a group of eight people at 11:00pm on a Saturday night. We had reservations and the restaurant was packed. \n\nIt definitely has a fun, LOUD vibe, so if you're looking for a quiet romantic restaurant, this STK is not for you. Unless you come before the music gets loud. \n\nThe hostess was fabulous, service was good, and the food was delicious.\n\nHere is why I knocked it two stars:\n\n1. There were middle-aged women dancing on top of the booths. That's fine in a nightclub, or even STK's lounge area, or even at someone else's booth who is ok with it, but they were dancing on top of our booth which was not ok. I was disgusted at the idea of sitting in the booth, while these women danced right where our heads were resting with their DIRTY, BARE FEET. Totally disgusting. I politely motioned to one of them and said \"Hi, this our table, we are sitting here\" with a smile. She looked at me and said \"So?!\" I was so surprised at this rude, middle-aged woman's response that I didn't know what to say for a moment. Luckily the hostess slid in and shooed them away, commenting how rude they were. Needless to say, it took a few cocktails for me to regain my appetite. If STK wants to promote a nightclub vibe do it where patrons won't be eating, or atleast impose some standards on who you will have up there dancing. Our party spent over $700 (food and alcohol) and for that money I don't want the experience of dirty, middle-aged Housewives-rejects dancing around my head as I eat.\n\n2. I ordered the 7 oz. filet mignon medium-rare. It arrived nearly well-done. No pink whatsoever. However, to STK's credit, the server was immediately apologetic and when my second steak arrived it was perfect."

It came medium well and that is a no-go for me.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe buratta salad was delicious.  Obviously the heirloom tomatoes have amazing flavor and go well with the cheese.  I've had a few other appetizers and they were also very good.\n\nSo don't go here for a steak.  They don't have very many other options and I wouldn't be optimistic in trying them.  I would go to the Cut."

Made reservations for 4 and were seated quickly with prompt service and a personable wait staff.  The food was as expected and worth every penny.  \nThe bread was hot and delicious and our steaks were cooked to perfection. I was adventurous and ordered the jalape\u00f1o onion topper on top of my filet and enjoyed every bite.  Mac was cheesy and the asparagus had a nice kick of zest.\nThe music was great and brought back memories of years past.  Props to the DJ for his mash-ups. \nMy only disappointment was that our Moscow Mules were not served in copper mugs due to customers stealing them. STK was where I first was introduced to that drink and raved about them to my brother and girlfriend only to have them served in a highball."

For dinner we had the filet and it was cooked perfectly at a beautiful medium rare. Try the truffle butter on top it is a perfect topping. We also had the truffle Mac and cheese and omg!!!!

I made reservation for Sunday @ 7:30pm we got there 10 mins early, it wasn't too busy ,so we checked in and went to the bar. Their drinks were pretty pricey, I had one of their Cocktails and my bf had Gin and Tonic and it came out to 33 bucks for our drinks! We got seated once we got out drinks and the seating was very close to one another, like if the waiter/server was trying to pour water for the table next to you, his butt will be right in your face or he would have to stretch way over.The food was OK, I had the 7oz. skirt steak which was alright, it wasn't too big or small, i also had their Mushroom pot pie and that was good. My bf had the Filet Medallion and Cream of Spinach he thought they were just OK. It was a nice restaurant with a nice vibe,But food wasn't that great."

We were celebrating my friend's Bachelorette and dinner at STK just kept the party going for us.\n\nSTK is definitely NOT a quiet steakhouse.  It is a straight up PARTY!  We waited in the bar area while our table for 7 was getting set up.  We had a couple drinks and within 3 tracks I was in love with the DJ.  Yes, a DJ, spinning in a round booth smack dab in the middle of the restaurant.  \n\nAfter about 10 minutes a hostess seated us at our booth.  Not long after our waiter Martin came by.  When Martin was explaining the days specials I literally stopped him as JAY Z starting pumping through the speakers and I belted out to him while waving my hands up and down... \"TURN MY MUSIC Hi-Hi-Hi-Hi-GHER!!\"  It was epic... but you had to be there!  We all had a chuckle and proceeded to order.\n\nSome of the tasty craft cocktails we had throughout our meal were the Cucumber Stiletto, the Lemoncello & raspberry martini, a Champagne with hibiscus flower in it, and Iced Tea Cocktail.\n\nA wonderful warm bread was brought out to the table.  It was soft and warm and yummo.  It had a light dipping sauce with it. Soon after our starters came out.  The Heirloom tomato and Burrata with pesto was good and i was very surprised at how good the Crab and Avocado salad was.  I was not even thinking of ordering it but I'm glad we did.  It was reminiscent of a spring roll almost.  It was fresh and wonderful.  I wish we got two.\n\nOur main courses came out and mine was the crowd favorite.  I got the short rib and it was lovely.  There were a couple orders of the sea bass,  a filet, and the tuna tartar.  \n\nI LOVE sides... see my \"last meal\" in the about me section.   STK's side dishes were delicious.  We shared the corn pudding, mushroom pot pie, the fries, green beans, and mac n cheese. \n\nWe had a really fun experience here, somewhere along the ride, \"SHOTS!\" was played by the DJ and servers were coming out with trays full of shots of alcohol and handed them out to our table among others.  There was also an older white guy that was getting DOWN on the couches.  He literally hoped up on his booth and table and was rocking out to \"Play that funky music\"\n\nSuper Fun, Super Pricey, but it's Vegas Baby.... \"You're so money and you don't even know it!\""

I'm so glad we did. The vibe here is amazing. Plenty of attractive people...women dressed up to perfection. It's loud, but not too loud. There isn't actually that much room to grab a drink and hang out without being in the way. However, none of the waiters/waitresses have an attitude about passing through. They very politely ask you to move with an \"excuse me\".\n\nThe music was bumpin, and some diners even got up and started dancing in the open areas or, like one woman, on the table behind her booth. I was even more impressed with that. Security was on the scene, but just monitored to make sure she was okay. It wasn't like bouncers in the club who get upset and yell at you to sit down. They assessed the situation, saw that she was in control, and let her (and everyone else) enjoy her dance. Again...customer service goes a long way, and they did it right. \n\nOnly minus is that drinks are ridiculously expensive here. I bought a round for 4 people, nothing fancy, and it was about $80. So be prepared, but you'll be sure to have a good time here."

They also came out with a complimentary dessert that said congratulations for my friend who was getting married. \n\nPrior to coming, I was told over the phone that they can only split up 4 checks per table. So when our server, James, split up and provided everyone a bill, I was surprised as I told each girl to bring cash to avoid any confusion. It didn't totally cross my mind at the time, but I was staying at the Cosmo at the time in a wraparound suite and am also an identity member. I forgot to save my receipt and I also paid for my friend that was getting married. I could use those towards my identity reward member. \n\nCalled Cosmo to speak to them about it and they suggested I call STK to have them email me my receipt. It's been nearly 3 weeks now and have called several times and just getting the run around. Therefore the 4 star review. Other than that, it is a great atmosphere here and the food is good.\n\nJust hopefully they get this issue for me resolved fairly soon."

Our server was friendly, and attended to our food complaints professionally.\n\nBread with blue cheese sauce and chive olive oil - This was rather adventurous and I really enjoyed it since I'm a fan of blue cheese. Unfortunately, my friends didnt enjoy it quite as much :( To each its own!\n\nBeef tartare with black truffle, sliced radish, soy caramel - Love how the fragrance of the black truffle brought out the freshness of the beef. The potato chip was also very fresh. Really enjoyed this.\n\nPork belly with soy glaze, pickled radish and ginger - The first time this was served, the pork belly was over cooked so much that it was tough and chewy. Not great. Had to send this back. The second time was much better and more well seasoned, though still a little too tough for my liking. I'd give this a pass.\n\nLil BRGs (wagyu sliders) - Super good!! We didnt add truffles or foie gras, but if I had the chance to do this again, I'd definitely try adding both!\n\nMedium Sirloin steak - The best steak of the night. Steak was beautifully cooked, soft, easily cut, and had a layer of fats making the steak not too dry. Definitely recommended.\n\nMedium filet with foie gras topping - Steak was slightly too dry for my liking, but foie gras was beautifully cooked. \n\nMedium Rare Filet Medallion - The first time this was served, the beef was way overcooked. It was so cooked that it tasted overly-charred, and the beef was definitely past medium rare. We had this sent back and the beef was perfectly cooked the second time round. Recommended!\n\nSides:\nMushroom pot pie - This was yummy, but way too salty. There is no way the pot pie can be this salty. We contemplated sending this back too, but by then have given up on having our food sent back so we just ate it anyway.\n\nTruffle fries - OMG SO GOOD. MUST ORDER. Freshly cut potato with truffles. Can't go wrong.\n\nMac and cheese - Decent but ok to pass.\n\nThe bill came up to be about $330 before tips, including a bottle of riesling, which is pretty OK. Ambience was nice with great music. \n\n4 stars for food (after they finally got it right), but unfortunately having to send food back twice is unacceptable for a fine dining restaurant, hence -1 star. Thankfully, the waiter handled it professionally and made sure we were very satisfied with our food."

But the food was fantastic, the service couldn't be better, and not even a hint of 'tude.\n\nEven the bread basket was a treat.  I normally don't like to fill up on bread before the meal, even if it's really good bread.  They brought out just the right amount - enough to take the edge off your hunger pangs without filling you up.  Their take on the bread basket was brioche with blue cheese butter melted on top, served with chive olive oil.  The blue cheese butter was subtle and mild, and the chive olive oil was just delicious.  For an appetizer, we both got the foie gras waffle - seared foie, huckleberries, herb butter & a waffle.  It's a creative combination that turned out to be amazingly delicious.  I get seared foie gras almost anywhere it's served, and this version might be the yummiest I've ever had.\n\nThe steak was first rate.  We got the porterhouse and flank steaks, both with foie gras butter.  Both cuts were done just right, and the foie gras butter made for a sinfully rich complement.  I got the asparagus for a side.  What I like about STK is they put a twist on all the steakhouse classics, without being pretentious about it.  Instead of the usual straight hollandaise, they make an orange-japaleno version, and it worked!  For dessert I had the frozen zabaglione, which was basically a semi-frozen eggnog since you couldn't taste any marsala wine (which I don't like anyway, so good).  From bread to dessert, everything at STK was superb.\n\nWe managed to finish out meal before the DJ started, so I can't comment on the volume level.  What made our meal a five-star experience was the service.  Our server couldn't have been nicer and more helpful.  When I dropped a knife that made a CLANG! so loud it sounded like it was mic'd up, another server scooped it up a second later.  When I apologized for my very noisy clumsiness, she laughed it off and said don't even think about it.  None of the 'tude I was nervous about, none at all.  Just creative, first-rate food and friendly, professional service.  Also, while STK isn't cheap, it's actually a bit less expensive than most of the top steakhouses on the Strip.  I can't wait to come back!"

Notable things on my last visit, their mashed potatoes and lobster mac and cheese side dishes were extremely yummy. I also really enjoyed their shrimp appetizer (I forget what it was called). I had the skirt steak and my boyfriend had the big eyed tuna. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly. The seared big eyed tuna was only good until we asked for some lemon slices and squeezed those onto it, then it was delicious too haha.\n\nService is great. Super attentive and helpful. Ask for anything and they'll probably bring it to you.\n\nOne star off though because both times that my boyfriend and I went, we went after 9pm and I guess it turns into some sort of club/restaurant place. I'm not a fan of extremely loud music playing while I'm eating that gets in the way of talking to the people I'm eating with. The waiter literally had to shout at us in order to be heard, which I think is just absurd. I'm all for a young, hip, and party atmosphere but I really think the music could be turned down just a little to make it a little easier to hear the people around you while you eat."

Came here with a friend and actually ate here two of the three nights we were in Vegas.  I had steak the first night (bone-in ribeye with foie gras butter grilled  medium rare) and it was very enjoyable, my friend had a sirloin filet with foie gras grilled seared rare and it was also top notch, his was actually a bit more melt in your mouth tender.  \n\nHowever, the star of the show for me was the beet salad, I am not sure if this is always on the menu, but I came back the second night just to eat the delicious appetizer again."

When you call around dinner time to make a reservation the same day most likely there are no more table, or after 10 pm which is way past my dinner time. \n\nwe had a bottle of veuve cliquot which was perfect with our appetizers tartar, and sea food platter (king crap legs, shrimp, crab salad, and oysters) the oysters r omg so small, they're like miniatures but they are absolutely flavorful and fresh. Also my friend keep on telling me their special house bread (blue cheese bread) was amazing with their olive dressing. I couldn't eat cheese so sorry couldn't give you my opinion, but I did tried the olive oil dressing that came with it wasn't bad at all.\n\nI had 7 oz skirt stake medium rare with truffle butter on the side which I took more than half to-go, I know 7 oz is really small, but I think it was all the appetizer, champagne, filled me up. Truffle butter was good, I never had any type of butter with steak, in my mind I saw \"truffle\" I just assume it was black truffle tapenade (maybe they do have off the menu in the kitchen somewhere) if that's the case.. you must have the black truffle topped on your steak. I tried my friend's filet mignon medium well it was perfectly done. I'm not very into red meat, but once a while it can be amazing especially when its done right like STK. It'll be perfect to pair with a glass of shiraz, but champagne was enough, I still need to able to walk in heels without wobbling and be able to fit in my tight clothing so that was that, no more drinking for me!!!.... \n\nI rarely give 5 stars, but I had to because I had an amazing time & great company with me. It was laughter, happiness, and amazing dinner."

Did a wonderful job of appeasing people of all ages.  \nAnyways, service was excellent, wine was VERY good, and the food is always delicious.  Had a filet, mashed potatoes and spinach.

Make a reservation for sure and if you're trying to eat around prime dinner hour, be prepared to wait (even with a reservation).  If you're not up for super loud music and a party atmosphere, go earlier in the night.

And my heirloom tomato salad that preceded it was fresh and delicious. Our table of four split two desserts.

Nothing impressed me, nothing made me want to come back or recommend it to friends. For a pricey meal it fell short. The food warrants maybe three stars, but for the PRICE the lack of flavor and terrible textures are just inexcusable in my opinion. If you compare the menu items I list with the price on the website, you will quickly understand why this review is warranted.\n\nWe ordered: \nAppetizers - Foie Gras French Toast (which I imagined would be amazing...unfortunately, terrible texture and TASTE. It was mushy spread on mushy toast.) and Shrimp Rice Krispies. Meh. The Shrimp Rice Krispies didn't have much flavor and the \"krispiness\" became sogginess after half of a bite. The krispies were for presentation effect as they did do a \"snap, crackle, pop\" when the bisque was poured over them. These were the items that drew us in as they were the most unique. The presentation was good, but the outcome was not a success.\n\nEntree - There were three of us. Two of us ordered the Bone-in ribeye and filet, both flavorless somehow but tender. They were the right temperature, which we appreciated. The third person ordered a smaller filet medallion with similar comment.\n\nSides - Mac&cheese, brussel sprouts and truffle mashed potatoes. They were good but when the SIDES are the best part, you know there is a problem. ALSO, if you are considering adding truffle butter to your steak, spare yourself the $12 and get the mashed potatoes for $11. It was basically a bowl of mashed potatoes with a pool of melted truffle butter sitting on top...which meant the initial texture was too watery to be appetizing. By the end of the meal, they hardened and were better.\n\nDesserts - Bread pudding and Espresso Charlotte, so so. No complaints but no wow factor.\n\nAs you can see, we sampled plenty of food to make a valid judgment call. It was sad to spend so much and leave dissatisfied. Wouldn't go back given SO many better options in Vegas. Go to the Wicked Spoon buffet in the same casino. Now THAT was worth it."

My steak (at 10 oz strip) was well prepared and the accompanying horseradish sauce was epic.  However, for $41 I thought it was a bit pricey.

The oysters on the other hand...were not shucked well...the had sand in every single one of them...which of course was rather disappointing. I alerted the waiter and he was extremely apologetic and removed them from the bill which I appreciated. \n\nOverall, my experience at STK was nice (great food and great service)..minus the oyster hiccup (still..it was pretty gross). I wouldn't object if someone wanted to come back to STK but it would not be my first choice either. There are plenty of other fabulous places to eat in Las Vegas that come without a side of \"ocean floor\""

The food here is subpar in comparison. The porterhouse was cooked well and huge, but flavor was lacking. The sides of duck fat fries, bok choy, Mac n cheese were all forgettable. The bread was good as well as my crab salad. If I had to pay for this meal, I would be very unhappy. Luckily it was comped so all is good. The vibe for younger patrons is nice though. Lounge/club feel while stuffing your face :-)"

It was crazy loud and practically like a club. Wasn't a big fan of that. Our waiter was super polite and friendly. Checked on us regularly. \n\nYellowtail appetizer was yummy. Fresh and it surprisingly goes well with apples. It also has a citrusy sauce that comes with it. \nMy boyfriends bone-in ribeye was okay. Wasn't juicy enough. Had better. \nI got the bone-in filet. Asked for medium rare. Was slightly over cooked in my opinion. But the portion by the bone was amazing.\nWe both got the STK sauce. Their house steak sauce was sweeter than I expected. The boyfriend wasn't a big fan, but I thought it was okay. I think the STK bold would have been a better choice. \nWe shared the cream corn pudding. That was a favorite. Tasted like a sweet mashed potato with pieces of corn. \n\nOverall, the food was okay."

After being in meetings all day and only feasting on mediocre breakfast and lunch buffets, I was really looking forward to a steak.  \nOur large group had reservations for an early dinner, and it didn't take long to get a table.  If you have an option, sit in the elevated level with booth tables.  It is more private, and not down in the noisy bar level.  \nThe wine by the glass list is tiny, with only one Pinot Noir option (wait, this is a steak place?).  Not very many beers on tap either, and those in the bottle were not impressive.  \nI ordered the small filet medallion medium.  It came out very WELL done, and dry.  At this point it had been over an hour and I was starving so I just ate it and didn't say anything.  Even the blue cheese butter couldn't save the meat.  My co-workers bone-in ribeye was decent so I would say go for that.\nSides are served family style, and each side could serve 2 to 3 people.  The parmesan truffle fries were a winner, crisp and flavorful.  The creamed spinach was ok, but not as good as other steak houses.  The sweet corn pudding was more gravy with little bits of corn occasionally.  Rudy's BBQ in TX could teach this place a thing or two about corn.  \nFood was WAY overpriced for the level of quality and service."

Said friend wanted to treat me to a fancy steak dinner, per my request, and I chose STK at The Cosmopolitan. Being a huge fan of the Hollywood location, I was more than excited to check out the Vegas venue. We made reservations on a Friday night for the following Saturday night. Make reservations, this place gets crowded fast.\n\nWe arrived Saturday night a few minutes early to our reservation and had glasses of wine while we waited for our table. The restaurant was filled with young folks dressed to impress with a DJ spinning hits all wrapped up in a dimly lit purple hued dining room. Just my kinda scene. Very similar to the Hollywood location. The hostess whisked us to our seat promptly and we sat down to order before we could even finish our first glass of wine.\n\nBrowsing through the menu, we decided to share a large portion instead of getting two smaller ones. We went big and got the largest steak option, The Cowboy Rib Steak, at a whopping 34oz for $100. Hey, it's Vegas so expect to shell out coins for stuff. On top of that, we got sides of mashed potatoes and asparagus. While we waited for our food, we were served table bread and nibbled on that while we conversed and watched the booming dining room come alive with people holding their drinks and dancing around. Great time.\n\nFood came out in about 20 minutes and looked amazing. Perfectly medium rare cuts of meat and a heaping portion. The sides were great also. I went in for another glass of wine mid meal because I like to get TURNT with dinner. Our server was constantly checking on us, even with having a pretty busy section (right across from us was a party of 15 or so people). Our meal altogether was roughly $200 and I think it was worth every penny. Though next time, I'd probably skip the asparagus and go for the mac and cheese. That sh*t looked amazing!\n\nIf you wanna drop some cash on some great food, nightlife vibes and excellent service while you're in Vegas, do STK. Just make a reservation. Unless you like waiting. I hate waiting.\n\nOK. I *highly dislike* waiting."

I also ordered the hearts of romaine salad.\n\nI received their pull apart bread topped with melted blue cheese and chive flavored oil for dipping.  This is really good but you have to hang on to your bread plate and the bread if you want to have any after starters are out of the way.\n\nWhen the salad was brought, the runner asked if I wanted some fresh pepper and he got the pepper mill and ground a generous portion for me.  The salad comes with a parmesan lemon dressing and it was very good.\n\nThe steak arrived and it was very rare as I had ordered and it was very good.  Plated on a bed of mashed potatoes with mushrooms, the steak was tender and as good as Rachael described it to be.\n\nFor dessert, I asked about two items and with Rachael's descriptions, I opted for the STK doughnuts and I'm glad I did.

Either we're a bunch of pigs or all the food was delicious because there was nothing left.\n\nAnother reason we loved the restaurant was the music.

            "review": "Brace yourselves again for yet another long review, we ordered a lot.\n\nI was confused when told STK was a nightclub with food. We arrived around 7 to a restaurant lounge vibe and left around 10 to loud club music and dancing around us. This place definitely changes atmosphere so pending your intention of the meal, don't expect good conversation later in the evening... it gets loud. Our server was very personable and lovely, over all wonderful experience. Perfect place to dine before heading out to dance, high energy. \n\nPEAR & ENDIVE SALAD - 14\nI'm pretty sure I got punched with a block of blue cheese, which for me was mortifying. If you're a blue cheese fan, you'll die and go to heaven with this salad... otherwise you'll just die.\n\n***** TUNA TARTARE - 19\nMy friend (and chef) was right in highly recommending this (as do I for you). A wake up call to my mediocre tuna tartare experiences. The grade of the tuna was sushi status. I can't explain how smooth, silky and fresh each bit was. \n\nFOIE GRAS FRENCH TOAST - 24\nThis combo had me tilting my head but surprisingly enough, it worked. The green apple, almond brioche and sherry gastrique were a tasteful medley. \n\nBUTTERNUT SQUASH ANGOLOTTI - 15\nGreat little pillows of comfort food like happiness. \n\nCOWBOY RIB STEAK 34 oz - 85\nPORTERHOUSE 24 oz - 65\nTrue to our medium rare request -- savory and seasoned minimally as a great steak should be. Fantastic.\nSAUCES - We chose Chimichurri & Au Poivre. The Chimichurri was my favorite but both went well with the steak. Great in complimenting but not covering its natural taste. \n\nMARKET FISH - Market Price\nA trio of seafood is served with this dish - the two fish were cooked traditionally and well. But the scallop. Oh the scallop. That heavenly luscious sweet thing of a scallop. Served on a little bed of peas and bacon pieces, seared perfectly. I was made fun of for chasing a pea around for what seemed to be 5-minutes, my laughing with everyone didn't help as my fork was vibrating with giggles (stubbornness kicked in as well on getting the damn thing) .. but if you manage to cut a piece of scallop, snag a bacon and spear a pea on the same fork ... it's a magnificent thing to behold.\n\n***** COLORADO LAMB CHOPS - 39\nDon't mind me while I sway to the now turned up club music with my lamb chop in hand. I mentally restrained myself from literally picking up the bone to attack the last few nibbles. Thank God the server took the plate away, I was growing weaker to temptation with every sip of my manhattan. Possibly my favorite lamb experience, which is huge as if I had to choose one meat for the rest of my life, it'd be lamb. Ordered and served at medium rare. Their pomegranate vinaigrette was subtle yet so perfect in bringing out hidden flavors seamlessly yet distinguishably. \n\n::: SIDES :::\n\nBREAD\nEveryone gets this. It's smothered in cheese and to be dipped in a green sauce. Messy to eat but very good! It reminded me of an oversized muffin. A couple of us (as we had 2 loaves brought out) did get hit with the stinky sock bite due to concentrated cheese.. so be careful of the piece you grab.\n\nSWEET CORN PUDDING\nI grew up loving cream of corn. This reminded me of it but way, way better. For such a simple dish, I loved it.\n\nCREAMED SPINACH\nAlmost a tad bit too creamed for me but the flavor was good.\n\nCREAMY YUKON POTATOES\nReally great side dish to cut the meats and intense flavors.\n\n:::ALCOHOLISM:::\n\nMANHATTAN\nWhen you think of this drink you think of an old guy. Let's ramp it up and drop this old guy in the middle of Manhattan rush hour with this cocktail in hand trying to cross the street at a green light, no spilling. Yeah -- it's that strong and intense. And the cherry at the bottom, pretty sure it soaks up 25% of the liquor so be weary of the face you make while consuming. With that said... definitely my kind of drink.\n\nWINE\nWe ordered a bottle of a full bodied dry cab which blew my mind. Paired with the meats it really pulled everything together. We also ordered a delicious bottle of pinot gris for paring with the seafood. Solid wine list. You'll be happy if you're a wino here."

They start you off with a chunk of bread that is lathered in a blue cheese butter which I admit was a twist, but misses the mark all around. It just made the bread a moist salty concoction of PASS (at least for me).\n\nI decided upon the skirt steak and I asked for medium rare to get ultimate flavor, but I'd have had better luck just licking the cow on the pasture instead..I did like the seasoning in certain bites, but it disturbed me that every bite tasted different then the one before and it was a little disheartening that the steak was a bit tough at times. As a side I dove into the lobster mac n cheese which definitely saved the meal for me. It was actually plentiful with the lobster portion and honestly just tasted like heaven in my mouth.\n\nThe overall service and wait staff were left with high numbers, but ultimately steak in Vegas will lead me back to Craftsteak. They are my chopping block for which to compare all others to and sorry STK you rolled snake eyes!"

            "review": "Ever trip the hubby and I take to Vegas we like to try at least one really expensive steakhouse restaurant and have a nice romantic night out. I should have listened to my husband when he said he hasn't heard the greatest things about this place (we have an STK in Washington, DC). But the reviews were higher at this location, so I thought it was good to go. I called a couple of days in advance and made a reservation. When we arrived the hostess had our reservation, but she said they needed a minute before we could be seated. This place was pretty packed on a Thursday night, and there was really nowhere to sit. So we kind of had to stand around. We also had to wait 10 minutes or so before we were seated, which I didn't think it was cool--since we made a reservation. We were seated in the lower bar area-- which again was a disappointment since we made a reservation --I really wanted to sit up stairs in the less crowded seating area. But I didn't make a fuss and we sat in the lower area. The water waiters served us water a few moments after we were seated. After 5 minutes or so of patiently waiting we finally received our waiter who gave us an overview of the menu. He explained things that were off of the menu, and I was really intrigued about the lobster macaroni. He gave us a few more minutes to look over the menu. Finally when he came back we placed our order. The hubby and I ordered a steak, lamb chops, asparagus, the lobster mac and cheese, and a side of crab legs. After we ordered the hubby and I noticed everyone had bread while they waited and we didn't -- and we had been seated at least 30 minutes or so. We finally tracked down our waiter and I asked him do we receive bread? He said oh yea and it would be out shortly. About another 5 minutes later we finally received the house bread. The bread was ok, but it tastes even better without the cheese and garlic they put on top --- you can request it without the cheese and we did. So how was the food?\n\n1. My husband thought his steak was pretty good but he said he has had better-- I wasn't impressed by his steak but I'm the seafood lady not the steak lady. \n\n2. My lamb chops were amazing!! Very well prepared! My chops were so good my hubby took a break from his steak and finished my plate. \n\n3. The asparagus was ah ok.. We like are asparagus soft and not crunchy and they could have used more time in the steamer-- in our opinion. \n\n\n4. The lobster mac and cheese was ok. I wasn't really impressed-- this dish also really pissed me off when we got the bill because it was $30 dollars!! My waiter didn't explain the price of this and if I had known this side dish was going to be so much, we would have left it in the kitchen. \n\n5. The side of crab legs were delicious! I really enjoyed! --worth $30 dollars\n\nThe vibe in here is more New Yorkish-- as in really loud and seats close together.. I think they are going for a club/restaurant vibe... The female DJ they had was on point, I have to give them props for hiring her. With the service, the wait, and the surprise pricing of food- I left with a full belly but a little annoyed about this place."

It's funny too cause he was literally two tables away from us. All our food was just okay not amazing. Cut and The Strip is way better than this place. Do not waste your time eating here when you're in Vegas. It's a nice place to get a drink before the club but not to have dinner."

I have never tasted tuna so fresh before. \n(We had the opportunity to meet the Executive chef and he actually showed us pictures of the Tuna before they cut it up. It was so great to meet him! He made awesome recommendations!)\nSkirt Steak- Medium Rare w/Foie Gras Butter - I died and went to heaven \n\nThe Chef sent out a sample plate of all the appetizers and desserts so we got to taste a little bit of everything.

I consider myself a mac  n cheese connoisseur and I like a good crispy crust with cheesy al dente pasta but this was more a creamy white concoction that I wasn't in love with)\n-parmesan truffle fries (not shoe string but more like perfectly rectangular steak fries, stacked kinda like jenga. pretty good but again, nothing to die for)\n-roasted carrots (baby yellow and orange market carrots - delicious, tender, flavorful)\n-mushroom pot pie (presentation was great. They bring it out in it's little pot, cut around the top of the crust and dump the dish out upside down onto another plate. Presentation was better than the flavor - basically different mushrooms in a creamy sauce, but still fun.)\n\n Overall: my steak did it for me. I'd go back."

If I'm dropping this kind of money on dinner I want a really good steak.\n\nThe ambiance is really cool - think NY lounge scene in a restaurant.  Loud music with a DJ, but it really worked.  A group of us ate here before a big night out and we definitely got in the mood to have fun."

Zaban the manager also stopped by to ensure that everything was amazing (which it was)! The atmosphere of STK is chic and trendy with a live dj who played great music during our entire meal. Decadent blue cheese bread with a chive oil is provided and I ordered the filet with truffle butter. The macaroni was our favorite side dish. The baked cookie dessert and sweet potato doughnuts ended our amazing meal. We will definitely return and cannot say enough great things about our experience!"

Eddy was our server and he was so awesome! So energetic, fun and knowledgeable. We started with the shellfish platter the flavor of all the seafood was all so good, so fresh so succulent mmmm... this honestly was so filling it would have satisfied us for dinner. Did we stop there though? Nope! next we got the Wagyu, I have never had Wagyu before and OMG!!! Now I know what I have been missing it was incredible!  It literally melts in your mouth! Honestly if you have an opportunity to order this, do it! You deserve to treat yourself! We all ordered a steak as well I got the 10 oz filet, medium rare with king crab Oscar topping. The steak was cooked so perfectly it honestly did not need the topping but the crab was very delish as well. All of our steaks were so perfect we all like medium rare but my brother in law ordered a bone in and Eddy our server suggested he ordered medium due to the bone it would come out a little more on the rare side if he were to go with medium rare. Eddy was on point with his suggestion. We also got the creamy Yukon potatoes, green beans and sweet corn pudding. We were so full with all the food and wine we were consuming! But we were having a blast and kept moving our bodies because the atmosphere was so fun they were playing the jams! A mix of 80's 90's and 00's, I have seen complaints of the noise level of the music and honestly I could hear what everyone in my table was saying and even our server.\nOkay so we are singing along to our fave songs dancing while our plates are being removed from our table and we are so in the moment I did not notice they were laying out small plates in front of us we had a confused look on our face, what Is this for? And then Eddy brings out 2 shots for each of us and then they bring out desserts!! Omg!! Donuts with this glaze, whip cream and pecans! And a Panna cotta with strawberry topping! I think we all said at the same time \"Eddy! What are you doing to us!!\" Lol, We were so full how are we going to eat this! Well those 2 shots that were brought out,I am not sure what the first was I just drank it and the second was ginger beer, Eddy said this would help make us feel less full or something to that effect I had a lot of wine by now :) it must have worked because we dug right into the desert which was so incredible it was like a party in my mouth. \n\nOur whole time there we just were amazed with each bite, each sip, each song and each encounter we had with Eddy. We were headed to the club later that night so we had to run but I honestly did not want to leave and I had so much more fun at STK then I did at the night club. Thank you so much Eddy and STK for the amazing experience!!!!"

And, she was very attentive, while remaining unobtrusive.\n\nI enjoyed everything I ordered.  As others have mentioned, the complimentary bread with blue butter is just delicious, but don't fill up on it.  You'll need the room for everything else. \n\nThe Beet salad with goat cheese was quite refreshing and all of the veggies beautifully presented.\n\nWe enjoyed two dozen of the oysters on the half shell with an assortment of sauces nicely arranged over ice.\n\nI had the 14 ounce filet on the bone and it was succulent, tender, cooked to perfection and topped with truffle butter - absolutely delicious.\n\nAlong with the steak, I also had parmesan crusted truffle fries.\n\nThis is a cool place to party with your friends or a nice place to take a business associate."

So I started at the south end of the strip and thought I'd walk until I found something to suit my mood. Stepped into a few spots and kept walking. I swung through Cosmopolitan and an irresistible steakhouse aroma clutched me. I asked a hotel concierge to tell me the source and in a short walk I was sliding on to a stool at the STK bar- fine for a solo. I liked the atmosphere which was lively and busy with a great DJ mix as a backdrop. The volume issues that I've read from others was not an issue for me because I wasn't engaged in any challenging conversations. \n\nI had the foie gras french toast, bone-in rib and a moscow mule. I enjoyed everything about them. \n\nI will say that I can't appreciate the rest room format. Get in line outside? Wait your turn? Follow the attendant's commands? Sir, may I use the bathroom? NO! What? Fix that.\n\nI'll be visiting Vegas again soon to celebrate my son's birthday and I'm pretty sure he'd like it as much as I, so I'll be back."

            "review": "Cliff's Notes version: The worst service we have ever had in our lives. Some of the best meat we've ever had in our lives. Calculate the risk in going here.\n\nJust as other reviewers said, cool vibe (DJ = good but loud), had to wait 30 mins after our reservation at 10:15 to get seated and came within moments of losing our table service at the club we were going to after. We, unlike other reviewers, were given no special treatment. We, too, were a bachelorette party.\n\nIn fact, we had the oddest, worst service any of us have ever had. There were 10 of us, all living/ having lived in the 3 major cities (NYC, Chicago, and LA) and it was literally the worst any of us have had, to the extent where several people wondered if our waiter was high on something. He was rude to the point of disbelief. At first we thought he was being snarky/funny, then we thought perhaps it was a shtick like at Ed Debevic's, but no, we realized as the night went on, it was just horrible.\n\nI want to be crystal clear - we were not your typical bachelorette party. We were a more mature group, and there were no boas/ genitalia accessories/ strippers whatsoever. Just looking to enjoy a good meal before going out for the evening. We all ordered quickly and did not ask for substitutions. Sincerely, we were an easy group. \n\nI also want to be clear that all of us are by no means strangers to having to wait to be seated/ put up with service issues in the \"hot spot\" du jour. \n\nAmong the complaints/ comments he made to us were:\n- I GUESS I can go ahead and bring you a drink menu (after a friend asked for one, and he suggested a signature cocktail and she said it sounded a little sweet for her) - as if he shouldn't have brought one to begin with just in general, much less at 10:15 on a Saturday and to a group of 10 people who were also celebrating a bachelorette\n- Do you even know what you just ordered? (when a friend ordered a glass of wine)\n- Nobody's ordering ANYTHING (when a friend ordered a salad first, and he asked whether he should bring it out first, and she asked whether others were getting starters)\n- Other outwardly aggressive stuff, like when two friends said they were splitting one of the larger steaks\n\nHe also pushed doing bottle service immediately without even asking if we were interested, and kept trying to push us to order more. Again, we all had tabs of about $60+, on which he automatically got 20%. Sorry that we don't want to each get 20 oz. filets before heading out for the night in tight Las Vegas club apparel??? Looking back, perhaps the guaranteed gratuity meant there was no incentive for good service.\n\nThe food was delicious. We had several veggies, all fresh but nothing spectacular; the macaroni which is highly touted and good, but again not the best I've had; steaks which even the most elite foodies in our group said were the best they've had, and the waygu sliders which were mind-blowing. No one got the signature cocktails, as they were all coated in candy and $18 apiece, which is absurd for a non-artisinal bar cocktail. I've had drinks at Grant Achatz's Aviary for less than that.\n\nWe left without complaining as we had to physically rush to make sure the rest of our night's plans weren't messed up.\n\nWould go back as the food definitely warranted a second shot, but I'd be weary."

Atmosphere is supposed to be laid back with the Severs in pjs and a live band playing (which we never saw when we were there...only a loud DJ). They start out your meal with monkey bread and cream cheese dipping sauce. I found it to be sickening sweet but my husband thought it wasn't too bad. He liked it. For entrees we ordered shrimp & grits and short rib hash. Both were good but rather small. The shrimp & grits could have been served in a martini glass because it was the size of a shrimp cocktail. The grits looked like a lot but they were spread so thin on the plate you only got a few bites. Same with the hash. Also, my husband asked for egg whites that he did not get. Service was good but we felt rushed. We were only there 30 minutes! Talk about trying to turn over tables fast! We thought brunch would be leisurely & sit back and enjoy ourselves but oh well. Decided to get another drink somewhere else. So for our meals, 1 glass of champagne, & a beer it was just under $90 plus tip. Too expensive for what you get. We both agree we wouldn't recommend STK to anyone or go back."

We chose the Tuna Tartar to start, followed by the Filet and Pan Seared Organic Chicken.

I asked my three other dinner companions and they all agreed whole-heartedly that it was a pretty big disappointment.\n\nMy last comment is on the restaurant itself.

I would given 2 stars, but our server was really on top of it, so I'm giving it 3.  $49 for a ribeye, I would hope that it would be tender, but it was really grainy and hard to cut into. My husband's first ribeye was half fat!  But the server noticed right away as he cut into it, and without hesitation took it back and got him a new one. The highlight of my dish was the foie gras that was on top of my filet.  I'm from California and foie is banned here, so I was excited to find a place that served it.  I know it's cruel, but if you missed my point of \"we eat a lot of steaks\", you can take it that I'm a true carnivore!  I would go ahead and skip this place, but it's good for drinks and lounging with friends.  They have a dj here nightly and depending on the night, they play good music.  They have \"magnum mondays\" like Marquis, where you buy a bottle and they bring you the Costco size!"

            "review": "A lot of people I know consider Vegas a true desert when it comes to finding outstanding food. Food that blows you away and makes you want to come back to Vegas just for a particular restaurant. They say it's glitz and glamour, expensive and flashy, and food takes a backseat. No where else is this more true than STK. \n\nIt's a great looking restaurant. It's hip with loud music and good looking servers and bartenders. You're definitely not at a loss for eye candy with the patrons. Actually not a bad place for the fellas to have a group dinner if they want to drop some coin on a place where food isn't the emphasis. Unfortunately I was here dining alone on business and food was my only friend.\n\nI don't think I need to go in to detail because I've personally never cared for detailed reviews of mediocre food.  I will say this.... at some level a place like this does have to get certain things right.. I mean, people do have taste buds and people do come here. So as long as food isn't the emphasis and there's some other reason pulling you here: another person chose it, you want to oogle at hot bartenders, you like dining in a club atmosphere, you can probably get outa here satisfied. Just know whatever you order isn't going to be on any of your bests lists."

However, we were offered to have the full menu in the lounge area so we did just that. We sat down and the friendly waitress came right over to get our drink order. I had the Electric Pink (I think) and it was delicious!! Next she told us the specials (and she was honest about one of them not being her favorite, which is always appreciated). \nShe then brought out the complimentary bread which is AMAZING! Hot and fresh with a blue cheese glaze. I could have eaten it all night. Our dinners came out just after we finished the bread. I had the small filet which was amazing. I also ordered the blue cheese sauce, but didn't eat much of it because the taste covered up the yumminess of the steak. That being said, when dinners come without sides the slab of meat is always lacking in presentation. We did order the mashed potatoes and mac & cheese to share (there is plenty to share). The sides were lacking (hence the 4 stars). The mashed potatoes tasted like mashed potatoes. There was no flavor to them whatsoever. The mac and cheese wasn't even as good as the \"blue box\" kind. It didn't have much of a cheese taste and I didn't like the tiny noodles that were hard to get on the fork. \nWe notified the waitress of a birthday in the party. They brought out a cute little dessert that they wrote Happy Birthday in chocolate on. I noticed on the bill that they charged us $2 for it. Not a big deal but if Chilis can afford a free birthday dessert, I would think that a place with a $100/person tab could throw one in as well. \nOverall, a great dinner and a fantastic time."

For the main course I had the ribeye and my wife had the filet mignon. The steaks were quite average compared to what we have had at other steakhouses. We also had grilled asparagus and mac and cheese on the side.  Not sure what cheese they used in the mac and cheese but it was not to our liking.  But this is not your typical steakhouse as its part club/lounge and its in Vegas. So from an experience perspective STK gives you the Vegas party vibe while you dine but I would not go there if I were looking to have a great steak. Also I would not go there if you want to talk to anyone over dinner because the music is pumping. My rating is based on the food."

I had a bone-in rib eye that was cooked almost perfectly medium rare. The taste was excellent too but the consistency could have been just a bit less chewy(I'm used to eating rib eyes that melt in your mouth.) I also had a caesar salad which was a couple wedges of lettuce mixed with caesar dressing and light cheese. It was exactly how a caesar salad should be, the dressing was not over powering and was not too sour and the lettuce was crisp. We also had the mac and cheese which was really good, but it was a bit sweet for mac and cheese. I don't need that much sugar in my mac and cheese. We also had the brussell sprouts which were just OK, nothing special. The restaurant also gives some kind of bleu cheese bread with dinner, and although I do not like bleu cheese, it really does not taste anything like bleu cheese, but the olive oil dip that comes with the bread is really really good. The bread by itself was just OK but with the olive oil it was excellent. Lastly we received three different plates of dessert because my friend knew the GM. The dessert was excellent, one plate had three types of cheesecake, the second had a couple different types of mousse and creme brulee, and the third plate had some kind of apple cobbler with captain crunch and vanilla ice cream which was outstanding. The captain crunch was interesting but it actually worked with the dessert! \n\n2) Ambiance\nThis has to be the loudest restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life.  It is basically a club with a restaurant built inside it. I didn't see the club speakers as they must have been well hidden but the music was really really loud. So loud that you have trouble hearing people at your table, even the person sitting next to you. Our waiter even got one of my friends orders wrong because he heard him wrong. The DJ who was playing the music, his booth was right behind our table which was kinda funny. Some of the music was questionable, such as Informer by Snow, or Blow the Whistle by Too Short, and some other ghetto rap. He might as well have played Jump by Kriss Kross and Ice Ice Baby by Vanilla Ice.  Don't get me wrong, I was born a hip hop fan and DJ but I don't really want to eat a $100 meal with bass shaking my table and chairs with music so loud that I speak less at dinner because I don't want to have to shout at my friends just so they can hear me.  If the music was about 5 - 10 decibels lower, I think it would have been much better.\n\nOverall, it is definitely worth trying for the food.  Just be prepared to yell at your friends so they can hear what you are saying."

The place was fairly empty when we went but got a hard time initially about switching to a more comfortable table/booth. The service was terrible. Our waitress didnt smile once or ask how we were. i felt like she did not even know the menu. It was straight cut to the chase, no friendly service at all. I tried to joke around a bit to lighten her mood but she just stared at me with a deer in the headlights look.\n\nThe food was good, no complaints there really but i felt uncomfortable and unwelcome because of the waitress. On our way out the door there were 4 hostesses standing at the front and they stared at us as we left like judging us or something, not one said good bye. Really awkward experience. I will never be back. If I am going to spend that kind of $ I will go somewhere more welcoming. We are well dressed (suit/dresses) and always tip at least 20% if not more. We were treated like we were not welcome and the staff seemed miserable.\n\nIf you want to go to a place with better service check out N9NE Steakhouse at Palms, Mortons off Flamingo Road or Gordon Ramsays in Paris Hotel/Casino."

The creamy fois gras melted tenderly with  You must order this. The beef carpaccio was great as well, it was served with a bit of pesto angel hair pasta. Very fresh tasting compared to the savory fois gras waffles, so it was a good balance.\n\nFor main course, there was a Thanksgiving Prix Fixe menu available, but really I came for the steak, so of course I ordered the bone-in ribeye with truffle butter on top. It was the tastiest steak I've had in Vegas so far. The meat was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of seasonings. You don't actually need the extra toppings.\nMy friend who did order the Thanksgiving prix fixe dinner enjoyed it just as much. It came with a main dish of turkey served two ways; traditional turkey breast and delicious breaded dark meat. It came with generous servings of all your favorite sides. \n\nPlease do not skip dessert. You must order the sweet potato donuts. They are \nridiculous.

Pure decadence.  I'll leave the flavor to your imagination.\n\nGood selection of steaks in different sizes and cuts.  Servers claim the beef is USDA prime.  Seems correct.  Good texture, marbling, well trimmed, good sear and properly cooked to temperature.  The Bone in rib steak, bone in fillet, and porterhouse excellent.  There is a selection Wagyu cuts.  Never tried them since their country of origin unknown.  Maybe the word \"Wagyu\" is baller enough?\n\nDo not pass on the foie or truffle butter.  Both add a great flavor boost.  Tuck the compound butters under the steak so the heat releases the aromas trapped within.  Excellent.  Add a slab of foie and / or shaved truffles to kick up the flavors even more and increase the baller status.\n\nSteakhouse standard sides.  All meant to be shared.\n\nVery good wine list.  Passable service (it's difficult to communicate with the servers thanks to the music).\n\nSimply put, it's Vegas baby."

Not only was the food very good,  (I don't eat meat or dairy (only fish)) Paul recommended appetizers for me and made sure the fish I ordered could be made w/o dairy. Then for dessert he brought out yummy sorbet and a round of Sparkplug shooters (vegan too) for the table. I have never felt more welcome dinning out. We will definitely be back!"

Found on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, this is the steakhouse to be scene at. The vibe definitely matches the hotel being swanky and trendy. The service was attentive and good for a steakhouse. The food - overall a good meal and price was reasonable for a steakhouse. Appetizers and salads - they are big on blue cheese here so if you are not a fan (like me) make sure that you ask that they do not include it on your dish. The bread and dip they give you is great (the bread has a blue cheese butter, but you can't taste it so I was ok with it - the dip is some herb based olive oil and it was phenomenal). The steaks - bone-in rib eye medium rare is excellent and pair it with the foie gras - definitely a luxurious meal with all that rich fattiness. This is definitely a steakhouse to come to celebrate a birthday or just hang out with some friends - I would not say its for a romantic date since the do play music (fairly loudly) and the crowd itself is extremely lively."

I expect this at Outback Steakhouse...not STK where I am paying $50 for a steak. Management was very quick to send them back to the kitchen, and while everyone was pleased with how theirs came back, mine was still overdone. I didn't want to hold up the group even longer (we were dining pre-concert) so I just ate it as-is.\n\nThat being said, management was very good about providing us with new sides (so they were warm when our new steaks came out), free dessert and a % off the bill. Much appreciated for sure. It was just a disappointment that we had to experience that in the first place, when we were out for a big night. I can understand MAYBE getting 1 out of the 7 messed up.......but 5? Really?"

I made a reservation in advance since I figured Monday would be busy since it's their weekly industry night. I was right. Even with the reservation, we had to wait a bit but the ambiance was fun so we didn't mind. Being a member of the industry, our dinner automatically got 25% off; one of the servers brought us three extra sides (and refused to take them back or charge us even though we told him we hadn't ordered them). All of our steaks (three different temperatures) were cooked PERFECTLY, and everything else was in a great sharable size. We got the cheesecake lollipops and the creme brulee trio for dessert to split amongst us. Everything was fabulous, the food was great, the music was fun, the atmosphere was not at all what we expected and we loved it. Would definitely come back!"

The black padding was a little odd, but at least we were shielded from the noise in the dining hall. Service was very attentive and the servers were ever present yet not annoying. \n\nWe shared crab cakes, chicken skewers, crostini, and seafood platters to start. After the kale salad with crispy quinoa, I delved into the 7oz. ribeye with lobster tail. The beef was cooked to a perfect medium. It was tender and minimally seasoned, allowing the natural flavor and juices to really shine. This was accompanied by a few sides that we shared - mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and green beans - none of which were particularly memorable. Clearly their focus is on the entrees.\n\nThe salted caramel budino was huge, too large for me to finish after my meal but it was topped with cookie crumbles and whipped cream, making the few bites that I was able to take delightful.\n\nDown the hallway to the restrooms is a guy manning a table full of bathroom essentials. Again, one more odd thing but I guess this is Vegas."

It is a small portion that can only be shared by two or three people. The flavors were on point though. For my meal I ordered a Filet Mignon with Blue Cheese Crust and Bearnaise Sauce on the side. The steak was prepared perfectly. The flavors of the steak, crust and sauce combined for a great taste.\n\nFor our sides we chose the Sweet Corn Pudding and the Mac & Cheese. The mac & cheese was creamy, rich and had good flavor. It is a solid side. The corn pudding, though, is fantastic. This was a great surprise. It sounds kind of boring and plain, but it had great flavor and textures. Definitely give it a try. You will not be disappointed."

Too late - we had been fortunately seated elsewhere. \n\nAmazing how the hostess could say - there is absolutely no way we can take a walk-in group this time on a Saturday on a holiday weekend - then 15 mins later being told we had a table.\n\nWe were so disappointed - this is my 1st 1* review on Yelp, but I believe it is deserved.

But, wait.. the Crab Salad saved the day and turned things around. A collective exhale henceforth graced the table.\n\nI had the filet: score. \nMy friend had a market fish which ended a drought of good seafood experiences since leaving recent travels to CA: score \nDessert was skipped for a seat at the posh bar, where cocktails are strong.\n\nAll in all, this place deserves four stars for ambiance.

It was too fatty for my liking and I also got the foie gras on top which was delicious but with a 20 oz fatty steak too it was just overwhelming. I was also severely disappointed in the fact that when I got there for my dinner reservation at 6:30 there was NO MUSIC.....I wanted to go to this place because of how lively I heard it was and there was NO MUSIC...is this \"not your daddys steak house only between hours 10-close?\" I don't understand. The bleu cheese bread tasted like popcorn to me..don't ask me why or how just next time you try it think of popcorn before you eat it and i guarantee you'll see what I'm talking about. The $20 tuna tartare appetizer was so tiny that my boyfriend and I had one bite each and we were done...for that price I was expecting way more tuna. Not impressed with the character of the wait staff (or atleast the particularly slimy fellow I had the displeasure of dealing with) or the lack of atmosphere which this place is supposedly all about. All in all a disappointing experience."

The restaurant is very trendy, \"yuppie\", and a typical Vegas restaurant. By this I mean you walk in and the 16 year old hostess is dressed in a mini skirt and hooker heels acting as if she's doing you favor by putting your name on the waiting list.  The entrance/bar area was blaring with Top 40/Alternative/Techno music which I thought was probably only confined to the bar area, but I thought wrong. \n\nWhen we were seated the music only got louder, thats when I noticed there was a DJ in the middle of the restaurant (only in Vegas). It was quite difficult to enjoy my $50 steak and glass of Pinot Noir with My Chemical Romance blaring over me. I definitely wouldn't describe this restaurant as an intimate setting.  My conversation at the table was minimal or straight yelling at one another.\n\nThe reason why I gave this establishment 3 stars, versus 2 is because the food was actually very good. Fresh baked bread with blue cheese melted on top is served with this basil/garlic? infused oil. It took awhile to get our bread, but well worth the wait.  I ordered the 12 oz. bone-in rib eye  medium rare and man-friend ordered the skirt steak, which both came out perfectly cooked.  The sides are ordered separately family style.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery, I highly recommend it if you like it smooth, no lumps. Service was friendly and casual, with the exception of the hosts.\n\nAwesome food, ok service, but I wouldn't recommend this place if you want to converse with the people at your table."

It certainly fits right in with the character of the Cosmopolitan and I will say that it did not let me down.  The music was a little loud, but not unreasonable considering  you are in Vegas where everything is over the top. \n\nThe food left a little to be desired. Great variety in the menu for a steakhouse and priced at the very high end of what one would expect but I certainly did not get the wow factor I was hoping for. Service was good, but I did not feel like it was personal or close to over the top....almost like we were just another table of 4 on their assembly line for the night. \n\nAlso, a little annoying is the fact that the bathroom is a single. It's not cool when you are at a supposed high-end restaurant and you have to wait 10 minutes (even longer for women) standing in a dark, back hallway to take a leak b/c 4 others are ahead of you in line."

The atmosphere is trendy and upbeat, so if you're looking for a quiet cozy atmosphere this probably isn't the place for you. We started with cocktails which were delicious, I had the strawberry crush and it had the perfect mix of fresh muddled strawberry and alcohol with a graham cracker rim. My husband and his friend had the stk mules which were spot on, and another friend had the ginger mojito, also fabulous. They did forget our appetizer, but as soon as the waiter realized he instantly apologized and brought it out on the house- the crispy lobster tails, which we were glad we didn't miss out on! I had a filet with the red wine sauce, and it was perfectly cooked and very, very flavorful. My husband and his friend had the rib eye, and he thought the flavor was up there with the best he has had! Another friend had the chicken as well which looked fabulous. We all shared the truffle Parmesan fries, Mac and cheese, and corn hash and it was the perfect complement to our meals in the perfect serving size. They brought out shots for us all and dessert on the house as well for my husband's birthday, which really impressed me. We all shared the bananas foster cheesecake- a perfect ending to a perfect meal. Our waiter and busboy and the staff were all phenomenal the entire evening. I would absolutely come here again!"

Our waiter was actually great; very attentive and laid back so it made the experience overall much better.\nThe food was the star of the show though....I like how the menu was set up. I was in the mood for seafood so I opted to try the seafood platter with cheesy jalapeno grits ( yes it was a perfect combination). It was absolutely delicious. My husband had the duck con fit and it reminded me of duck bacon ( yum) so It was like a party in my mouth.\nI recommend trying everything on the menu if you can afford it lol"

For appetizer, we ordered the Foie Gras French Toast and ordered the jumbo lump crab salad, side of roasted carrots, asparagus and mushroom pot pie.  Our friends ordered the 14 oz. bone-in filet, and tuna tartar for their app.  We shared the sides which were the perfect amount of sides for 4 ppl.  \n\nThe dessert was amazing too!

Ok fine.  Then they offered to have their pastry chef recreate it but they wanted an arm and a leg for a tiny cake.

It's been a week to this day that I got the pleasure of trying out this contemporary restaurant w/in house dj.  The music was so loud you could barely hold a conversation unless you were two inches apart, which I think is a little on purpose.  ;)...but enjoying such good food, who would mind?!  In fact, I was enjoying it all so much, I should've had my own table.  All I can say is, that was one of the plumpest, juciest meats i've ever had.  My friend ordered a scotch whiskey to accompany it. Not a bad choice and his wife, venison chops, which were delish.\nI started with the pear/endive/arugala salad/walnuts/blue cheese crumbles ...very light and tasty followed by a shared plate of carpaccio, which I had heard of..maybe 6 years ago.  Very tasty with the pesto pasta..don't have it any other way!  The Seafood Platter for $40 which included: 2 oysters/ 2 pickled shrimp with jalapenos and red peppers/ alaskan king crab/ 1/4 maine lobster.  It came with the horseradish and usual side sauces but there was another with a little vinegar..you hardly tasted it (and i'm not sure what else was in it) to add a little flavor.  I made the right decision there, as I was trying to keep my dinner as 'natural' as possible..just adding a little kick to it.  I enjoyed my main meal, which is more of an appetizer for me, with a rum/basil/cucumber cocktail.  I could not have been offered a better suggestion.  The dessert was a berry mousse.  Topping it all off with a glass of champagne. One of the best meals of my life. I could not even fathom tainting all the good flavors in my mouth by touching the parmesan truffle fries, which I hear...are the rage. I can't wait to go back, even if it's by myself, at own little table. The pleasure will be all mine."

Actually, I had steak the night before at The Henry and THAT was amazing.\n\nI ordered one of the most expensive steaks on the menu here at STK - an 8 oz cut of wagyu. Got foie gras on top as well, and a side of mashed potatoes ($12 for a small cup...). Also ordered the sliders they're supposedly famous for.\n\nThe sliders were very good, but overpriced.\n\nThe wagyu was not tender and flavorful at all. My friend got the ribeye and it was significantly better, but still not as good at The Henry's (so I still wouldn't come back to STK even to get something else). The foie gras wasn't very good, and we sent it back to cook further, which improved it but we've still all had better. Finally, the mashed potatoes were good, but at $12 for such a small amount, it wasn't worth remembering.\n\nOverall, our meal was nearly $160 for 2 small sliders, 8 oz. wagyu which didn't even taste like wagyu, foie gras, and mashed potatoes. Was totally not worth it."

They were friendly but inattentive at times.\n\nThe sommelier was more of a wine waiter - not warm and fuzzy at all. Many wines were out of stock, including the three least expensive Cabernet, the wines were brutally overpriced (well over 2x retail), and lists started at very high price points (most over $100). We only ended up with two bottles for the table, they were so so wines and were $80 each, and I've never until now not really enjoyed wines at this price point.\n\nThe steak - the can do raw steak just fine apparently, but then they go and cook it, what the heck? They were out of several steaks. The Australian Kobe steaks were priced OK, but I didn't get them (12 oz @ $140). Fillet Mignon was out. Annoying. So I got the porterhouse. The porterhouse on the strip side was not trimmed properly and the meat seemed to come from a bovine weightlifter. The fillet side was very good. But I was upset I couldn't just get fillet, the beef was trimmed wrong, and how un-marbled the strip side was. \n\nLines at the restrooms, very annoying. There is clearly a problem with this restaurant handling the volume of people and their restroom needs. Build more restrooms.\n\nExtremely loud. The DJ, the moron he is, didn't use headphones, so the volume just kept creeping up, it was at club level noises by the end. Screaming was needed to have a conversation. Who is the restaurant manager here, some idiot - I mean, I'm supposed to spend $140 on a steak and eat it 12 inches from a JBL bass cone thumping at  5 inches of deflection? Seriously?\n\nI was not happy, and felt this place overall had bad value, and the main course was underwhelming and the environment was brutally loud."

Racquel treated us very well at the table for dinner - she is very smart and funny with a great personality.  She spent a lot of time talking with us making sure we ordered exactly what we wanted. \n\nWe split the filet which was done perfectly - medium rare. The truffle Mac and cheese was to die for - but the spiced maple carrots were just ok. Not bad, just ok. Then Raquel surprised us with an anniversary dessert with 3 different options - they were all deeeelicious!!  Thanks Raquel!!  We'll be back soon."

Fancy finish out, pretty people, and music that is a bit too loud for dinner.  I assumed the loud music had to do with the hour, but some guests that were leaving as we arrived said it had been loud the whole time.  Seemed a bit aggressive, even for a restaurant one door down from Marquee...\n\nThe Food:  3 Stars (Appetizers), 5 Stars (Entrees)\nThis is literally the first meal I've ever eaten where the entrees outshined the smaller bites by a big margin.  It is usually the other way around!\nThe GOOD: \n1.  10oz Filet, Truffle Butter topping - melted in my mouth, amazing!  One of the better steaks I have had in my life, yet it was topped by....\n2.  14oz Bone-in Ribeye, Foie Gras butter topping - If I could rate something 6 stars, this would get it!  Our friend who got it gave us each a bite, and then had to fight us off stealing the rest of it.  I got one more a couple more bites to evaluate for this review, but didn't need them.  The entire table was salivating, and they liked their own steaks!  Perfectly flavored, perfectly cooked (medium rare - ), it was worth every penny and probably more.\n3.  Dover Sole - got strong reviews from the group even though we wondered why he ordered a non-steak...\nThe OK: \n1.  Foie Gras French Toast - nothing against this dish itself.  The Foie Gras was quite good and the toast tasted fine.  But getting about 3 bites of it for $24 was pretty much a waste.\n2.  Caesar Salad - our buddy didn't care for it, his friend who tried it said it was nothing special.\n\nThe Service:  4 Stars\nThis would have been 5 stars if he hadn't messed up one guy's drink and another guys after-dinner drink order.  Water glasses were kept full, he was highly knowledgeable about the menu, and he basically got carte blanche for any mistake he might have made just for recommending the bone-in ribeye with teh foie gras butter.\n\nThe Bottom Line:  If you don't mind the music/ambiance being loud, this is a great steak place, honestly one of the best I've ever been to."

I'm in the hospitality business myself for over 13 years. \n\nI understand Vegas is different. But after being sat, I just couldn't stop looking around asking myself... \"Are they playing a joke on us?\"  \n\nTHE MUSIC IS UNBEARABLY LOUD!  We thought it might just be at the front, or the bar area. Nope!  We were sat towards the back and I just couldn't believe it. Again, I get it... It's Vegas, they want the young \"see and be seen\" attitude, but when I can't hear my gf who is inches away, or our server for that matter (until he started yelling to us which was awkward).  I didn't bother asking why the music was so loud, I'm sure they get that often. \n\nThe food was good. Had 3 appetizers and we each ordered a steak. It wasn't the best steak I've ever had, or had in Las Vegas but it was good. Steak grade maybe a 6 out of 10.  \n\nOur table was kind of awkward as well. It was only the 2 of us so you almost have to share a curvy booth with strangers. The table next to us seemed annoyed as well. Maybe this is why the music is so loud, so we don't listen to one another's convo?  Maybe it's so that we eat and go... Thus, they can turn more tables?  \n\nAfraid to say, this is a \"NO GO BACKER\" for me. The food... Maybe but the music being so loud I don't ever want to stand while trying to enjoy a nice meal. \n\nTab was ~$320 for 2 people. 3 apps, 1 martini and 2 steaks (not Kobe). \n I tipped $30%."

Very nice place.\n\nThe place is located in one for Vegas newest  and hottest hotels, that would be Cosmopolitan, just by saying that you would know that the place is crowded and full of  people who want to have fun.\n\nIts super loud inside, so if you are looking for a place where you can have a conversation, STK is not the place.  However, there is lots of good music.  I think they have a DJ playing top 40, so you can get your pre-club game on.  \n\nThe service is pretty good, the waitress answered all of my questions.  \n\nNeedless to say, the food is pretty amazing.  Meat is cooked exactly how you ask for it to be cooked.  The side dishes are also pretty good.  The girs got a happy b-day slice of cake after we finished dinner. Price wise, well its vegas so it is a little expensive but it is worth it.  All in all, good place to have a nice dinner.

The experience was nice and there were good vibes but the food wasn't all that. The first issue could be that I don't eat steak but ... ah ... sue me. \n\nI started the night off with a glass of wine. It wasn't bad but not my favorite because they really didn't have a sweet wine. Next the waiter bright out bread with a pesto sauce. The bread was very good. The sauce added a nice touch to it. After wine and bread we placed our orders for entrees. I had fish( the fish itself came with small diced potatoes with a lemon caper sauce) with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. The fish wasn't bad. The creamed spinach wasn't that good. I absolutely love Ruth's Chris Creamed Spinach and when I saw it on the STK menu I got really excited. I guess I assumed it would taste like Ruth's Chris and it didn't and I was disappointed. The mashed potatoes were just mashed potatoes, nothing special. \n\nOverall STK was just mediocre for me. It was nothing special. I feel for the amount of money you spend its not worth it. I like a expensive meal every now and then but I want it to be good as well. I doubt I would come back."

The atmosphere was loud and very sexy, but the setting was perfect because we could still have an intimate conversation at our table. \n\nTo start, they brought us the delicious bleu cheese butter bread and this tantalizing sauce to go with it. It was like a chive, garlic, olive oil blend and it was nothing like I've ever tasted before. It had us all craving more!\n\nNext, we ordered the beef carpaccio with these wonderful pesto noodles. Highly recommend this dish and it still stands out to us, even the next day.\n\nFor dinner, we went a little craZy. We had to try some of these unique sides! My personal favorites were the mushroom pot pie and the original Mac and cheese. Our server (who was lovely and I can't remember name!) recommended getting truffle mashed potatoes and keeping the Mac and cheese to a regular order. I'm SO happy we did this. We loved that Mac and cheese so much, we ended up ordering another one  \nWe also shared the 38oz cowboy ribeye (sliced in the kitchen-thank you again to our server for that suggestion)\nThe steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare with a crispy, charred layer on the outside and a warm cool center. It melted in my mouth.\n\nHands down, one of the best dinners I've had in Vegas. Make a reservation because you'll certainly need one for this packed house! And rightfully so, I cannot wait to go back for another delicious meal!"

For dinner I had the small skirt steak with the jalapeno onions on top, it was a little over seasoned especially considering I ordered a topper. Perfectly cooked though and was more than I could eat. My S.O. had the seared big eye tuna, which he thought would be a tuna steak, he was seriously disappointed with the eight small pieces of tuna that had half a cup of sauce on top. Not worth the price. Dessert was so so, but their cappuccino is amazing!

The place is very much a scene, but they don't deliver on the food.\n\nwe started with the foie gras french toast which was pretty good. i had the NY Strip which i ordered medium rare, it came out med+.  no biggie, if the steak is good, it will stand up to being overcooked.  now i said 'if' and this one did not qualify.  It was under seasoned and really lacked any intense beef flavor.  I'm assuming that at the prices they charge, that the beef was dry aged, but it really didn't taste like it had been.  very lame for a $50 steak.\n\nthe wine list was horrifically overpriced, even by vegas standards. we had a bottle of Justin Cabernet which is about $25 retail...it was $100.  4x retail is just absurd.\n\nBasically, go if you are into the scene and the ambiance and don't mind overpaying for a sub par meal.  If you are looking for a great steak, there are a ton of other options!"

It was during CES so very entertaining crowd watching. Nestled in a great spot in the Cosmo. Great atmosphere.\n\nSo of course, it being Saturday night, the place was packed. Reservations were made days before so we were solid.  For starters, we had a dozen Oysters and Burrata. Both were great and the Oysters were from the PNW - so pretty delicious.\n\nFor the main course I had the bone-in Ribeye at med-rare. Topped with truffle butter, though it did not need that. It was rich, flavorful and cooked perfectly. Very good. My wife had the Roasted Dover Sole which was out of this world and is something that she is craving, even now. So mad kudo's for doing the fish perfect for her!\n\nWe didn't do desert cause we wanted to try David Chang's newly opened Milk Bar on the floor below!\n\nGreat place and is a solid option if you are dining on the strip! Yes, it is safe to say that we will be returning here for dinner in the near future! Enjoy!"

We arrived 10 minutes before our scheduled reservation but there wasn't a problem we were about 18 people they seated us and very efficiently,the waitstaff was very accommodating and explained anything that we wanted to know about the menu, The Decour I would say is Modern The noise level wasn't bad at all it was easy to converse without screaming some of these restaurants in Vegas tend to be very loud but again that's Vegas! Now for our meal we started out with a cold fish platter consisting of oysters on the half shell shrimp ceviche alaskan King crab and clams on the half shell (little necks) The presentation was very nice the Alaskan King crab all cracked open for you,the drinks from the bar were very good and they served us within 15 minutes remember we were 18 people, Now to the main course I had a peppercorn crusted bone in ribeye 24 ounce I received my steak and it was prepared just the way I like my steak medium rare! My wife ordered Chilean sea bass which was excellent! The parmesan fries is a must-have!! Also the corn pudding if you don't have it you will definitely regret it!The prices are a little on the high side but that's what you expect in a good steakhouse and this is a good steakhouse! \n\n                                                             Bon app\u00e9tit,  Joe D."

When I was invited to go again, and for free, I figured, why not? \nEither I stepped up my steak game, or STK fell off even more because overall- NOTHING impressed me. Wait, I fib, the mushroom pot pie side dish was good enough to order again. So out of a dinner that would have cost $145, the best part was a side dish?!!?\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the gyoza, a field greens salad, the 20oz ribeye sliced, the mushroom pot pie, and a panna cotta dessert. \nFirst, sharing is the way to go. Other than the potstickers being extremely small, coming with only 4, and costing $19- I was happy with the portions and servings. They offered to split the salad and slice the steak, very appreciated for things like that. \nThey staff was on game, they cleared our plates and gave us fresh silverware after every dish. The salad needed more of the cheese and croutons. That's what made it enjoyable. The steak was just ok. Not amazing, not bad. The bacon butter on top was super succulent. The side of mushrooms came in a classic looking pot pie crust, and when you cut into it there were about 4 types of mushrooms in a creamy sauce. It was the highlight of the night! The panna cotta, never again! Wrong consistency and just all around not enough flavor for me. \n\nAnother downfall- one glass of wine is $17. I understand fancy steakhouses charging more for specialty cocktails, high end liquor, etc. But even then it ranges about $10-$15. $17 for a glass of mediocre wine, is pathetic. \n\nI get STK's concept. A sexy club feel with high end food. Except that wasn't the vibe I got. More like a cutting corners steakhouse that caters to the local adult industry, rich tourist, and old men who like the eye candy. \nVegas needs that, don't get me wrong. I am not hating on the adult industry in the least. But when there are well known Vegas working girls that dine there on the regular, it attracts a certain crowd. You wouldn't see those same girls down the street at Herb & Rye, thank God. \n\nOverall, my favorite part was the DJ bumping 90's jams, and the mushrooms. I will gladly skip out on the drunk, red head tourist sitting next to me screaming, and spilling stinky wine, and the pervy old guys. \nHowever, Vegas has a place for everyone, this is just not mine."

We were seated quickly despite the restaurant being full.\n\nThe music was pulsing and the vibe was good. The DJ played quite a few tunes from the early 2000's - which was fine with me since I'm in my thirties and it brought back fond memories of when I wild and mortgage-free. The servers were friendly but were a bit difficult to get ahold of for drink refills.\n\nHubs had the beef short rib, which was good. I started with the Steak Tartare with black truffle, sliced radish and soy caramel, which was fantastic. It definitely put the tartare at Comme Ca to shame in a big way. For my entree, I had the seared big eye tuna with wasabi potato, maitake and sweet miso jus. The ahi was great and full of flavor. I was hoping for a bit more potato to  soak up all of the wine; however, my dish only came with about 2 small tablespoons of it. Luckily hubs and I ordered a side of mac and cheese to supplement our starches. However, the mac and cheese was just ok. It was bland. I'll be honest, Kraft mac and cheese from a box tastes better. I wish they had the option to add truffle oil to it...that would've done the trick. The portions were small but the food is so rich, we probably couldn't eat any more than we got.\n\nNear the end of our meal, we remembered that we never got any bread so we asked for it. It was warm, fresh and came with this delicious pesto-like dipping sauce. Wish we got it at the beginning of our meal, but unlike other restaurants, again you have to ask for it. \n\nIn any event, we left the restaurant full and happy. We would definitely return.\n\nExpect to spend about $100 per person."

From the moment you walk in, the hostesses, the managers, bartenders, servers, and diners are all outgoing, excited, high energy, beautiful, and cool people.  In fact, I was probably the most uncool person in the place - haha.  Top it off with some delicious food and some great beats coming out the speakers and a night out at STK is better than a great night in the casinos.  OK - not really, but it is a whole lot better way to spend your money than a bad night at the tables!\n\nSince STK is in the Cosmopolitan, you would expect it to be a little on the hipster side - and that is not meant in a bad way - and it does not disappoint.  The Chandelier may be the coolest bar on the Strip and STK complements it well.  As I mentioned, the atmosphere is on the loud side with mostly old skool hip hop playing - probably not the best place if you are looking for a quiet romantic or business dinner.\n\nOur service team was very attentive, knowledgeable, and accommodating.  \n\nI had the petite filet, which was done perfectly.  The table had all kinds of sides, but I particularly enjoyed the truffle fries, mushrooms, and creamed corn.\n\nFor dessert, the server whipped up a little sampler plate for the table, which was excellent.  \n\nOne downside is that they only have single bathrooms so the line was a little long - although I imagine you could find one just outside the restaurant.  \n\nBe sure to make reservations because the room is a little on the small side and be sure to bring the credit card because the bill will be a little on the big side.\n\nIf you are in Vegas to celebrate something special or you just want to live like one of the beautiful people for the night - get dressed up and head over to STK."

It would have been nice to have known, before everyone is sitting in each other's lap for an expensive dinner.\n\nThe waiter was pleasant and efficient, the food was OK.  Host staff was useless.\n\nI was a guest at The Cosmopolitan, but STK is the worst part of the hotel."

We went as a family brunch for Mothers Day, and at first we were impressed, everyone was friendly, the restaurant seemed nice, and there was live music. The live music stopped shortly after we got there, they then proceeded to play nonstop explicit rap, not even the rap that you hear on the radio. I don't want to hear about \"B$&@*\" this and that when I'm trying to have brunch or dinner, let alone a nice meal with my mom on Mother's Day and we even had children with us and not ok for our children to be asking what a \"n word\" is and why are they saying bad words. I wouldn't even go to a night club if they were playing that music. We couldn't even enjoy our meal and just wanted the check. Just not appropriate for a restaurant especially on Mothers Day."

Prices are ridiculous, but I guess that's to be expected at a Vegas steakhouse. \n\n(one small other thing... 'full bar'? No. They have no draft beer! Which seemed to be really common in Vegas. I mean, its a steakhouse, so I'm having a nice cabernet anyway, but why no draft beer? If I want beer I have to have a $9 bottle of Blue Moon? Maybe it's because I'm from Portland and live in SF... but I expect good restaurants to have a few good drafts. Some micro-brews or a nice Belgian or SOMETHING!)"

STK may not have a formal dress code but the ambiance deserves the common courtesy of looking presentable at the very minimum.  I of course decided on my blue pin striped suit with colorful pocket square to add that bit of splash. \n\nI went past the line and straight for the bar since you have access to their full menu. They have two bars here. If the first one is full continue towards the back and you will most likely find an open seat.  The bar tenders were absolute dolls and very attentive, making you feel at home.  With the DJ spinning tracks in the background and with dim lighting, it sets you up for an evening out on the town. \n\nFirst came out the bread which gets mad reviews from Yelpers across the board. I thought the hype was over the top, turns out it live up to it and plus more. \n\nI started my dinner with a field greens salad which I didn't expect much other than a common mixed greens salad.  It was amazing and definitely worth a try if you liked feta cheese. Beside the vinaigrette which was full flavored it had candied pecans which were succulent.\n\nOn to the main course, their Colorado Rack of Lamb. Ordered it medium rare as any respective lamb lover should.  It was seasoned to perfection and sinfully marbled. You are almost forced to gnaw on the bone and since I was at the end of the bar counter, I couldn't help myself and sneaked in a couple of nibbles. It was simply that good. \n\nFor desert, on recommendation from the lovely bar tender, I went with the sweat potato donuts with caramelized walnuts. Mind you I hate anything sweet potato but after being referred to as honey, sweetie and babe the whole night I couldn't refuse the recommendation.\n\nI'm glad I did because it was epic and in the top three deserts I have ever had in Vegas. I paired it with a latte and it was to die for. A definite must have."

Groovy black circular geometric interior; be sure and have your children dress you and be careful in those FM heels.\n\nOur group of three had an excellent small fillet, good double lambchops and good pork chops. The Corn soufle is sweet but interesting, and the other sides were all good. Some interesting small appetizers like steak or tuna tartar. Had a delicious bread pudding and small ice cream cone fest for desert that was excellent. Not so impressed with the wines by the glass at around $15-17 but some really decent bottles like an unfiltered Newton Merlot. They will let you taste the by the glass, we didn't like them, a bottle was a better deal imo and we went with the Newton.\n\nWe didn't feel rushed but this is a busy place, not quiet. Service was attentive and just short of too much.  I can best contrast it with the equally pricey but better meal we had at Aureole with a much larger menu including an excellent fixe price menu and a MUCH larger and superior wine menu, significantly cheaper than STK's wine list with a little hunting. Stunningly more quiet and private, just like The Strip versus the SouthEnd.

I ordered the shrimp rice crispies (yum!), strip streak and topped off dinner with the cheesecake lollipops (sigh, so good!). Our server, Amy, was extremely knowledgable about the menu items. The environment is loud with a dj spinning a pretty good mix of hip hop/top 40. Its not for the faint of ears. Then again, I arrived at 10PM when the music was at its loudest, it could burst both eardums. But if you're aware of the loud music, then don't act surprised when you can't carry on a meaningful conversation with your dinnermate(s). Its just not the time and place for that. Its a party crowd, with really friendly/upbeat staff who even sit with you at your table. I love it!

They also plated it atop so much ice that by the time it came to our table some of the ice had melted and ended up overflowing onto my lap:  downer, considering I was dressed up to go out after.  A couple people at our table got steak, which I'm assuming is what STK is known for, and the unanimous opinion was \"meh, ok, but not great\" -- their thoughts not mine so i would still try their steaks for myself.  The dish that stood out to me the most was the Mac n cheese-- delicious.  But the side should not be the star.  \n\nAnd I hate to call them out on this, but after we were done eating and we were sitting, enjoying our wine and coffee, we were rushed out.  Like \"oh we need this table now\" kind of rushed.  I understand they may have been busy, but rushing people out who barely put their forks down was in poor taste and slightly rude.  Granted they offered us free shots at the bar to make up for it....but what if we weren't big drinkers, recovering alcoholics or god forbid, pregnant?  Disappointing.\n\nThis was our first time dining here, so I won't be quick to completely dismiss them and never dine here again.

The choices were kale salad and salmon bites to start, brunch club sandwich, pancakes, and prime rib hash for entrees, and cookies and milk or donuts for dessert.  We decided to try as much as possible so we each ordered differently, excluding the pancakes.\n\nWe began with a complimentary champagne and the bread basket that came with an icing dipping sauce.  Unique bread offering, especially giving it a dessert feel to begin and end the meal.  The portions are enormous at every stage of the morning.  The kale salad was easily a meal on its own and as good as it gets.  The smoked salmon crackers with cream cheese had a full fish with the amount of lox they plated.  And these were just the starters.\n\nThe club sandwich came with plantain-like sweet potato fries and four double decker cuts.  The avocado was a great addition to this dish.  The prime rib hash came with a couple of poached eggs and some hash browns underneath with a nice sauce.  Out of those two, I would recommend the hash, especially since STK is still the Cosmo go to steak house, brunch or not.  But both are great options and enough to take home for a meal later in the day for sure.\n\nThe dessert - just plain ridiculous.  The donuts come 6 to a plate and are just well made, fresh offerings.  The milk and cookies (get this dessert!) comes with a medium sized vanilla milkshake (one of the best I've ever tasted), and 10 cookies.  Ours included gingerbread, chocolate chip, and powdered.  I believe it is based on chef's choice though.  Their dessert game is spot on from the opening bread to the ending platter.  I usually don't order dessert at restaurants, but I am really glad I came during restaurant week to experience this treat.\n\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant itself is very clubby with an active DJ during the 11am-2pm brunch time.  It didn't seem like a too crowded restaurant for brunch (maybe Eggslut's opening was taking some buzz) but it really should be.  I will most definitely be back to try other brunch offerings or for dinner to stuff my face once again.  It's not your typical high end, classy joint ambiance-wise (prices are on par, however), but still a fantastic meal.  Portions unbelievable and definitely a sweeter alternative for brunch in town."

The only part of the entire meal that stood out were the parmesan truffle fries which were perfectly done to the right crispiness. \n\nThe ambiance is quite loud, not the best place to take someone out for a romantic date as it's hard to even hear yourself.

Each time we asked the hostess, she was more rude - like the fact they can't manage their restaurant was our fault. We left and went next door to Jaleo and had a great meal. Paella was incredible. There are tons of great - well run places to eat in Vegas. This isn't one of them."

This is the place to go if you want to have a lively, good time while eating dinner. They played Top 40 during our entire dinner and my friends and I danced in our seats while eating. We should have just stayed at STK all night instead of trying to get in to Marquee (what a waste of time, by the way.) Our server was completely on top of it and very accommodating as I'm sure we were a little bit difficult to handle being a party of 8 and drinking. The food was also great. My steak was cooked perfectly and the sides were all very good. I loved the ambiance and my boyfriend even said that he felt like he was on Gossip Girl, Las Vegas edition and that it was the best looking crowd he's ever seen."

Rest assured if you REALLY love this spot you are what i would consider a massive tool.\n What's undeniable is the food is good but at these prices there are literally 100's of other options in town- most of which won't have your back vibrating off the booth from the bass blasting from the crappy club music through the place. For 75+ per I'd like a. To be full when I leave b.

We thought this was a missed opportunity for the restaurant to sell us drinks and appetizers.  Once seated, the service was great.  Staff was friendly and attentive, but the food was subpar.  Unfortunately, only one person was pleased with dinner.  She ordered the short rib.  Others ordered steaks and complained they weren't cooked as requested. I ordered the kale salad and fish special ($58). The salad was okay, but the fish was underwhelming.  It was bland and wasn't cooked through.  Sadly, I enjoyed my $8 breakfast the next day more than my $115 meal at STK."

            "review": "I have no idea what all the fuss is all about. I have been to many better steak places than this one. The one thing this place has going for itself (in my mind) is that it is young and hip. Great people watching, but that's about it. \n\nWe came on a Tuesday night, the place was quite crowded. We waited for about 45 min for a table. They seated us (8 people) on a round table that fits 4-5 comfortably. I thought this was unacceptable. When you are spending $200 a pop, you expect to be seated comfortably. It's very loud (music). Quite tough to have a conversation at the dinner table.\n\nFood is very expensive. They charge for everything extra, e.g. a little sauce on the side. The side dishes are tiny and $12 each - very pricey. There are no fries, the asparagus and spinach were very bland, both were cold by the time they got to our table, the potatoes with cheese and truffles on the other hand were quite yummy. There are no fries. The cheapest wine is $85, the most expensive $13,000 (for a bottle that retails for $200)\n\nHowever, what is really the worst: the steak isn't that great. I had the sirloin medium rare. It was served on a cold plate and by the time I got my steak it was cold. It's sad to get a cold steak when you pay $200 a pop for a meal. The cut wasn't that great - quite stringy. Did I say already that the steak was disappointing??? One of the people in our group had the tuna. His verdict was \"not edible\" apparently strange texture and weird sauce. He is the least picky person I know, so it must have been quite unpleasant. But I guess you don't go to a steak house to eat tuna...\n\nService was mediocre. We constantly had to ask for water refills. There was no salt / pepper on the table and it took a long time to get some when our steak was there. While less trendy, the food at the Capital Grille is much better in my opinion."

For dinner we picked the shrimp rice krispie squares, macaroni and cheese and the much-recommended mushroom pot pie. I ordered a filet medallion and he had the 16oz. striploin. All was incredibly delicious - especially the mushroom pot pie! It was to diiiiiie for!\n\nWhile my boyfriend was in the washroom, I asked our server if we could get a dessert with a candle and she responded \"yeah of course - it's your boyfriend's 30th birthday, right?\" I was stunned! For the restaurant to pay attention to that reservation detail, remember it and relay the message to our server was highly impressive.\n\nApart from the food and dessert, we also had wine and cocktails. The selection is solid but not overwhelming.\n\nWhile the noise level isn't exactly \"intimate\", STK had a lively vibe with most-excellent tunes. Every song that came on excited me, including '80s Madonna, UB-40 and even Tom Cochrane (being a Canadian, I was stoked). My only complaint might be the hostessing staff - there was something about their attitude that left a sour taste in my mouth, so thankfully the rest of our STK experience more than made up for it!\n\nAt the end of the day, we would most definitely find ourselves at STK again. It's not your everyday place to grab dinner (for the two of us for two glasses of wine, one martini, two steaks, an appetizer, two sides and a shared dessert it was $220 with tip), but most certainly worthy of special occasions. Believe the hype."

As others have noted, the looks is sleek and cool - very vegas but the music is unbearably loud and we ended up having to shout at each other to be heard. The tables are a joke, way too small and uncomfortable.  Food was terrible, meat was dry, tuna fishy. Wine list was overpriced and underwhelming.  I've been to the Beverly Hills location and it's wonderful, so this must be a Vegas thing.  My recommendation, try Mastro's in the nearby City Center - far superior atmosphere, food and drinks."

Go to any other steakhouse - Gordon Ramsay Steak, Mastros, Cut, and they will show you what real good creamed spinach tastes like.

Not only is there their staff super friendly and accommodating, their food is absolutely delicious! The complimentary bread they give before your meal begins with their house made chive oil was the start of something new and different. I have never had anything like their chive oil before. It is so good and inspires me to make some on my own! went on yelp to see what foods looked yummy and wanted to try the bone in rib-eye steak, cut, medium rare. It does not disappoint. Our waiter recommended the mushroom pot pie and the rich creamy mushroom sauce was heavenly. \n\nI almost forgot the best part. The beef carpaccio with pesto pasta in the middle is probably the best thing I have ever had in my life. It was very different, very beautiful, and very very delicious.\nFinally, the strawberry pistachio cake with ice cream was so good I almost cried. \n\nI had such a great dining experience here at STK. If you want to try something different, that has quality, and will leave you feeling very satisfied, then I highly recommend STK. The food, our waiter, and the ambience surpassed all of my expectations. I felt very relaxed, comfortable, and full after my meal. Thank you STK. I'll be coming back again!"

The bread we got was so hard so I asked for another one. My waitress responded with that's because it's the end of the night and the kitchen is closing soon. Are you serious?1! It's Vegas! And so what we get bread that's been sitting around all night. So she brought out another one and said that this was THE very last bread of the night...and it was just as hard. I use to love that bread. Immediately were rushed to order drinks and food. My strip loin was perfection! But that was the only thing. The jalape\u00f1o grits had no flavor, but that's the first time I've ever had them. The mushroom pie thing was so disappointing. I swear they must have run out of mushrooms because once I cut into it the top deflated and the inside maybe had 4 mushrooms and 2 pearl onions. With the rush we didn't have time to order dessert. We spent a good amount on food and drinks and to not really be able to enjoy was a buzz kill. I doubt I'll come back to this location again. Sad."

The asparagus was wonderful, the salad was salad-like and I was embarrassed to ask them to burn my sliders and they came out 'medium' if medium means purple. Apparently this is how you're supposed to eat these, so no deduction for me being a shut-in. We said no to dessert so our server brought a platter with fried sweet potato doughnuts, salted caramel gelato and ginger snaps. This increased her tip by twice what the dessert would have cost us so props to NECI. The people at my table who more closely resembled adults all were thrilled with their Filet, Sole and pumpkin ravioli. My seasonal boycott of all things pumpkin prevented me from sampling.

It was regular mac n cheese, lobster, and truffle. This was good enough for 4 people. My favorite was the truffle mac n cheese.

What I really disliked was the poor customer service from the manager. I watched as he tried to stop a father and son from entering the establishment. He claimed there was a dress code and they didn't fit it. That would be fine if it was true, but I was sitting next to a guy who looked like he just came off a farm...jeans, t-shirt and cap.  It appeared that the manager had a personal bias towards these two patrons based upon ethnicity, but who knows.  Maybe the guy was just a moron and having a bad night.  Fortunately the manager was extremely unintelligent and was no match for for the father.  He eventually allowed these two guys in when he ran out of excuses. I listened how the father explained to the boy that this type of bias still exists in America but to not let him get discouraged.  This is the story I will be sharing when people ask me how the restaurant was.  Shame on this establishment for hiring such a disgraceful man."

            "review": "STK is a very cool restaurant. After being seated, I got the feeling the owners started off building a nightclub, then switched their mind and morphed it into a steakhouse. One word: silverware. You'll be amazed by how cool it is! The staff on hand was excellent; beautiful people, most of which could also carry a highminded conversation. \n\nThe food: The monkey bread is from another planet, where they specialize in making really, really good bread.. You'll want to eat two or three of those. I didn't ask for more, it was one of my regrets upon leaving!\nI order a small filet, scallops and broclini as a side. I requested the filet be cooked to medium rare (as most steaks should be!). The filet was pink and red throughout the steak...not cool. The chef forgot about the order of scallops. They appeared 10 minutes after chomping down on the steak. I only ate one of the two. \n\nThe drinks: Wow, Grey Goose Martini with Blue Cheese filled Olives? Try it, you will be amazed.\n\nPerhaps I visited on an off night? Since the Cosmopolitan is newly up and running, I understand that STK is not at peak performance yet. For the price I paid, I can say that I expected more. Though I would give STK another opportunity, but only after they've gotten all the kinks out. Given the right amount of TLC and hard work by those controlling the operation, STK could reach its' potential as one of the best restaurants on the strip. Cheer's to being an optimist."

Once in a while, one may run into service hiccups which normally happen between 9PM and 11PM. This is the restaurant's busiest time with every seat occupied and every server to go along with it all.\nWe started with an appetizer of Alaskan Crab Legs. You only get two however they come glazed with garlic butter sauce and I had ordered them warm and not chilled. Huge hit with the Pinot Noir that we were paring these with.\nI had the delicious 14oz bone-in Filet Mignon along with the 1 1/4 lb lobster tail to make it a Surf n Turf. The steak and lobster tail was prepared to my liking and was complimented well with a side dish of Truffle Fries. If you haven't tried their Truffle Fries then please do so since it beats the standard potato sides in my opinion. I think that the sprinkled parmesan cheese combined with thick slices of potato arranged perfectly on a plate makes this a good side to have. The filet was as soft was butter and tasted amazing with very little spicing. I had declined additional sauces or garnishment for the steak as well. \nThis restaurant can only have one challenge and that is service and that too because it will always be compared with the world class food and ambiance. It appears that the only thing that may slip here is service."

The atmosphere is just what we wanted; upscale but also fun, the server was awesome and let us take our time, made great recommendations, and the food was all delicious. We had the burrata, a wedge salad, the chicken entree, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and broccolini - all shared family style. The server brought the salad out chopped so it was easy to share and had the chicken sliced for us in the kitchen, without us asking. Definitely the best restaurant I have been to on the strip and a good model for restaurant owners to base server training on. Will be back during future Vegas trips for sure!"

Although I've heard about people having reservations and them not being honored in a timely fashion, I've personally never experienced it.  In fact, we actually had reservations for 7:30pm, we called to move it back to 8:30pm and they gladly accommodated that request.  Well, we called again to have the reservation moved back once again and that was accommodated as well, with no hesitation.  To make this short, we called again and ended up with reservations for 10:30pm.\n\nUpon our arrival we were promptly taken to our table and the server immediately asked whose birthday it was.  I know it isn't much, but that little attention to detail from the notes in my reservation was pretty awesome.  Most places actually never catch that.\n\nNow on to the food.  I had the 7oz Filet Mignon with Truffle butter and it was delicious.  The steak literally melted in my mouth, and the fact that I like my meat very, very well done says a lot.  Their creamy Yukon Potatoes we also on point and very tasty, however, their truffle fries were pretty bad.  That being said, the service and the rest of the food was so spectacular that I couldn't knock them any starts for their really, and I mean really bad truffle fries.  They literally tasted like they were left in oil for a couple of days.  Obviously I know that isn't the case, but nonetheless, that's what they tasted like.\n\nThe place itself is very trendy and loud.  It's my kind of place, but if being able to hold and intimate conversation is your thing, then  this probably isn't the place for you."

            "review": "Too loud, too trendy, too touristy, too prominently situated on a nationwide list of top money makers and thus too expensive, Los Angeles import STK is one of *those* restaurants that locals love to hate, and although claims regarding of the dearth of affordable dining on Las Vegas Boulevard may indeed be warranted the fact of the matter is that in an economy built on fantasy there are few restaurants pairing quality cuisine with a club-like environment, a look at the work of Chefs Stephen Hopcraft and  Brigette Contreras showing The Cosmopolitan's third floor Steakhouse to offer just that.\n\nOpen at 5:30pm with the digital outdoor menu not yet updated to seasonal changes found inside it was followed by a friend caught in traffic that I was greeted on arrival at the hostess podium and undoubtedly setting a standard with staff that is almost *too* good looking it was not long before seating was offered at a spacious four-top, a pleasant and forthcoming media contact named Erica taking the time to sit down and provide a little background on the restaurant as well as herself until my tablemate arrived.\n\nAdmittedly a menu with some sticker-shock, the $150 Lobster Thermidore and $22 Sundae not the most expensive I've seen but enough to give one pause, it was with excellent service from a surprisingly well-informed and energetic young man that the show got underway and although the DJ did not begin until 7:30 the space was jammed by 6:15, a small kitchen expediting like professionals as staff worked at a breakneck pace.\n\nEnergetic but never obnoxiously loud, music from The Doors or Bob Dylan followed by oddities from the Early-80's playing overhead as patrons chat and dine, every meal at STK begins with their famous-for-good-reason Brioche Pull-apart topped in Blue Cheese Butter with addictive green dipping oil, signature starters of a split batter-fried lobster tail over slaw and seared duck liver with tiny pancakes proving a bit less sharable than one would expect considering the pricetag, though both were well executed and also tasted great.\n\nWell paced and attentive to details, bussers doing a better job than most local fine dining spots at keeping glasses full and dismissing dirty plates, it was after a quick tour of the black and white room with gator skin print plus light that makes anyone look a little more pretty that a dish of carpaccio arrived and although the meat itself is well flavored with balsamic and tomatoes adding acidity, the most impressive aspect of the dish is the unexpected pesto noodles, delicious on their own but even better when placed within the context of the plate.\n\nDuck recently removed from the menu, but still with numerous entrees, steaks and sides made to share, it was on the server's recommendation that the tender Bone-In Filet was ordered and cooked just past medium-rare the flavor was plentiful, though not as robust as that at Jean Georges, Delmonico or Carnevino, while the Dover Sole spoke to Hopcraft's skills sharpened while working with Michael Mina, a simple roast rendering the white flesh flaky yet moist with brown butter and capers plus crisp fingerlings that might be even better than STK's addictive Parmesan Truffle Fries.\n\nImpressed by the manner in which the kitchen allowed the Mushroom Pot Pie to express its intrinsic earthiness without mellowing it for a \"club\" crowd while taking the corn pudding almost as if it were a pre-dessert considering the substantial use of sugar and cream, the parade of sweetness actually began following a warm Americano that helped to compensate for notably chilly room temperatures, a complimentary trio of housemade ice creams and sorbets highlighted by smooth coconut and a malty version of chocolate both foretelling of good things to come.\n\nAlready seeing - and hearing - doubt from the server that two-people could manage four desserts after  \"so much\" food it was with Chef Contreras shattering Apple Tart that the degustation marched on and utilizing phyllo dough plus plenty of butter to construct a high-rising cup around roasted apples the timeless classic found a new level in terms of texture, the robust crust crackling bite-after-bite even as ice cream melted and outperforming STK staples including the rather mundane skillet cookie and exceedingly light donuts that were not excessively sweet despite the maple glaze, best bites being the donut holes with toasty nuts and a dollop of whipped cream.\n\nParticularly intrigued by the aforementioned Sundae, the questions of cost brushed aside with \"big enough to share,\" suffice it to say that although quite well conceptualized in terms of taste and complexity there are far better ways to spend $22 on Ice Cream elsewhere in Las Vegas, the tender banana bread itself likely better utilized as part of recently-launched Sunday brunch or the previous menu's bread pudding."

Luckily, what I really liked about this experience was the star of the show, the porterhouse steak which was delicious beyond words. Seasoning was done just right, medium well, it was juicy and melt in your mouth good. I was extremely impressed with this Omaha based steak and I can proudly say I've eaten Omaha steaks in Omaha! This steak was done perfectly, I couldn't have added one thing to make it better.\n\nSeating is a little tight, I felt like the atmosphere was too intimate, we were sitting so close to other tables.

There haven't been too many reviews yet for this restaurant, which made us a little uneasy about choosing this place. All we knew is that we wanted to try a restaurant in the Cosmopolitan and both the vibe & menu of STK got our attention. \n\nWe checked out the Chandelier Bar & managed to lose some money on the tables before heading over for our 8:00 reservation. My first impression of this place was that it was a bit smaller than I expected, and other reviewers are right in saying the music is bumping. \n\nWe sat at the bar for about 10 mins. before being seated. Although I would have rather sat back further in the actual dining area we were seated in another dining section right off the bar...I guess it made for some good people watching at the bar (like guys with lucky poker pants...see pics)! Also, I thought it might be a little hard at first to hold a conversation over the music but to my surprise it wasn't at all...but maybe that's because the more I drink the louder I naturally get, and so goes for my spouse and probably just about everyone else out there, haha ; ) \n\nThe bread is amazing, so amazing I took one bite and just stopped so I wouldn't get full off of just bread.  For starters, we had their foie gras french toast and beef tartare. Both were exceptional....the foie gras french toast had a very interesting flavor while being sweet at the same time and the beef tartare was actually the best I have tasted. I have only ever tried like 3 in my life, but it just surprised me how fresh, light, and tasty this one was! \n\nI ordered a filet, which was a bit over cooked for medium but I didn't want to send it back and just enjoyed what I could of it. My husband's ribeye was cooked a perfect rare and he just about ate the whole thing! On the side, we enjoyed maple glazed carrots and sweet corn pudding. The sweet corn pudding tasted like a dessert to me, almost not like a side at all. We passed on actual dessert and just enjoyed our wine. \n\nOur server was great! Usually, when we go to restaurants we are often attended to by a team of servers. And, sometimes it's even hard to figure out who the head-server is, but at STK our server stayed with us the whole time, which we enjoyed. \n\nOne thing I wanted to note was that the music was definitely bumping and other reviewers are correct in saying if you are looking for a quiet, romantic dinner for two...this isn't the place for you. If you are looking for an upbeat space with some great service & food then you STK might be just what you are looking for."

I'm guessing they served the steak to me without adequate rest and oversalted the meat a bit.\n\n5-stars for the mac n cheese and yukon gold potato puree side dishes. i thoroughly enjoyed these side dishes. of all the steak places i've eaten, it is nearly on par with Craftsteak's side dishes. \n\noverall it was a good dining experience."

The seafood tower is grand and looks cool among other tables, but the value just isn't there.  Especially if each oyster or claw works out to be like $20 a piece.

If you have a large party, try and book the private room.\n\nService was good.   We were on a tight time schedule, and our server managed to get us in and out with just enough time.

The ambiance was subtle with prosperous 30-somethings, well-heeled adults, plus large parties of young ladies and young men.  Even at an early dining time (7-ish), the restaurant was busy and lively.  Went there are a recommendation of a golf caddy who raved!  Goldeneye Pinot was on the menu, which you almost never find! Go!"

I liked STK.  The steaks were great, but not the best I've had.  The lady servers are smoking hot, and very friendly.  The drinks are good, but if you go here, know that you are eating gourmet steaks in a bar like atmosphere.  Very noisy, not intimate at all, and that's okay if that's what you want.  \n\nAfter the experience, I was pleased, but Jean-Georges stands out as the best I've had in Vegas, with Gordon Ramsay being a very close 2nd.  Almost too close to call.  STK doesn't get 5 stars like they do."

Each time I was with a large party and we would have to scream across the table and even then we could barely hear each other or were repeating ourselves multiple times.  Other than that the customer service is phenomenal and so is are their menu items.\n\nI really wish they offered something else with their complimentary bread other than blue cheese or just plain.  I, nor many others who I dined with, were a huge fan of blue cheese.  I ordered the same filet mignon medium rare with truffle every time.  Each time better than the last.  We decided to try every sauce they have.  All seemed a bit bland to me.  My favorite would have to be Bernaise sauce but it just wasn't as flavorful as I have had.  With my steak I either ordered shrimp or lobster.  The shrimp are abnormally large but none the less very flavorful. Our table shared a bunch of sides including creamed corn, mac and cheese, etc.  All very tasteful.  The only thing I have to say was the worse I ever tried would be the foie gras I got as an appetizer.  Not sure what flavor they were going for but the pairing was way off for my taste buds and the foie gras seemed to be cooked totally wrong.  Other than that I will definitely be back.  Stick to steak and sides and you definitely won't be disappointed."

I had made a reservation for 8:30 but when we arrived  the hostess told us it would be a few moments and to wait in the lounge.  The place was busy so not a huge deal.  After 15 minutes, she starts to seat us at one what was probably the worst table in the restaurant it, it literally shared a bench with the lounge not exactly what I was imagining for a cozy date night.  The boyfriend and I shared a \"Help!\" look and he asked her if any other tables were available she said if we wanted to wait 25 minutes she could seat us somewhere else.  And so we did, not the best start but after waiting we got a lovely little curved booth in the carpet area of the restaurant.  Moral of the story:  If you don't want to share your bench with the guy trying to hit on that one chick in the lounge specify where you want to sit when making a reservation.\n\nFor an appetizer I ordered the pear and endive salad, it was yummy but had far more frisee lettuce in then I was expecting for a salad that only listed endive and arugala.  Not bad just surprising.  The boyfriend  ordered the Alaskan King Crab and it was almost orgasmically good.  Three good size crab legs; definitely best part of the meal.  For our main course we shared the 14 oz bone-in filet (medium rare) and a side of lobster mac and cheese and the truffle parmesean fries.  The filet was cooked a perfect medium rare and looked beautiful.  It was tender, melt in your mouth quality meat except for the fact it had almost no seasoning.  I was so disappointed, for a steak house I expected more and it was just bland.  The fries were good though, the perfect amount of truffle.  Sadly the mac and cheese was just a total disappointment.  The boyfriend and I are total gourmet mac and cheese fiends and order it everywhere and this was definitely our least favorite we've ever had.  The cheeses used were really bland (once again, STK where's the flavor?) mozzerella and something else I think.  Try Holstein's truffle lobster mac 'n cheese, downstairs at the Cosmo, it's so much better.  \n\nWe hoped to have room for dessert but unfortunately after the food and a bottle of wine we were too full.  Our bill was $274 before tax and tip ($100 bottle of wine) and while we were both stuffed we were somewhat less than satisfied, I don't think we'll be coming back again."

Music was louder than avg, but not overbearing. \n\nThis was stop #2 of our foodie tour of Cosmo, so we were planning on a cocktail maybe, and an appetizer or two. We settled on the Lil BRG sliders and a side of their Jalepeno Cheese Grits. Both were great. The sliders had excellent flavoring with a nice sauce. The star was the grits rhough. Phenomenal with just a hint of jalapeno.

The decor is modern and very different from traditional steakhouses. The atmosphere was on the clubby side and the music was pretty loud. But from where we sat the music wasn't too bad, but we still did have to talk louder than usual. \n\nThe bread was amazing! And it was in such a cute shape. And the sides were good too. My fave were the truffle mac n cheese and the mushroom pot pie. I wish we had more of the pot pie because between 7 girls, there wasn't much to go around. =( I shared lamb chops and the beef short rib with another girl and both were really good, although I love lamb so I have to say the chops were a tad better. And I really liked my Strawberry Rhubarb Cobbler. If you thought it was my dessert, you would be wrong...it was my cocktail! And it was delicious: fruity but you could still taste the kick. It came in a martini glass rimmed w/ graham cracker crumbs. I think most of the others liked their entrees too. Unfortunately a couple of the other girls didn't like the steak they ordered. I tried a bite and agree that it was overcooked. \n\nOur server was great and attentive at first (as most places are) but it dropped off a bit after we got our food (like many other really busy places). I knew this place was super pricey but I was disappointed that the portions were on the small side. The sides are smaller than I would have liked and the entrees i shared could have been larger as well, although we were both full at the end, so i guess you can say it was just right. I would go again if there was an occasion to, but if i wanted to have a really nice expensive meal at a steakhouse in the same price range, I'd rather go to Mastro's."

He said he could put it back on the broiler.  After I had eaten on it?  Lo and behold that is exactly what happened. The same steak came back with a mild apology.

Two salads were great, my husband who I try to get to eat more vegetables said \"if you could make a Kale salad taste like this, I would eat it everyday\" the sliders melted in our mouths. The carpaccio was excellent. Their pull apart bread with chive oil soo warm and tasty. Then for dessert, even though we were stuffed, we split the peanut butter cake with honeycomb and their famous doughnut ... Even though we were full we cleaned the plates.

My party and I, group of 7, wanted to try something different on a Friday night, and wondering if we should have tried CUT instead?\n\nAnyways, let's go over the positives. The service is good, friendly waiter with strong knowledge of the menu. Not pushy, and gives you time and space. Other goods were the bread, the corn, and the dessert. The steak for some were better than others, mine was slightly charged (the cowboy steak). My favorite part of the meal was probably the dessert: we got the donuts and the cheese cake, both really good. Oh yeah the truffle fries were pretty good.\n\nThe negatives: portion size of the sides for $13 - two people won't be full on one. Also, pricing for drinks (might have been $13-15 per well drink?), maybe a little bitter about the alcohol portion of the tab since I was in a casino and can get drinks for free (or while losing hundreds)! Lol. Another negative as stated above, the partially charred steak, my friends said theirs were really charred. The Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes were meh! Guess overall slightly disappointed for a $750 meal for the 7 of us."

We tried to make reservations earlier in the day but were told they had nothing available but were welcome to stop-by to see if anything had opened up.\n\nWe arrived and almost immediately, they found a spot for our party of 4. It is definitely a lively spot. We were dining late (around 9pm) and the music was loud, the place was packed and everyone was having a great time.\n\nWe all ordered steaks, and they were wonderful. I order my steak well-done, and most steak houses will still bring it with some pink in the middle. STK cooked it to perfection, just how I asked. My husband and his friend both said it was the best steak either of them had ever had.\n\nThe creamy yukon potatoes were amazing as well.\n\nGreat experience, will definitely be back!"

Hostesses, waitress, bus boys, food runners were all really nice and good at their jobs. Food was fine-- like all steak houses. The wine list? Maybe the shortest and most over-priced I've ever seen. They had, maybe 12 Cabernet's. Total. They ranged in price from ~$90 on the low end to $1,000+. Really? I'm used to seeing 12 pages of literally hundreds of Cab's at most steak houses, rather than 12 total. So weird and out of character for a high end steak house. The desserts were just so so, btw. Steaks and sauces were outstanding! I thought the music was great."

The hostess selected a really crummy table, but there were lots of other better tables available, and the place was not busy at all.  Having none of that, I asked for a better table and got a little better one.  The thing is, they seat you cheek by jowl, and it isn't comfortable, and certainly doesn't seem like fine dining.  \n\nAtmosphere?  Granted, it was still early, but there was no DJ playing, and the place seemed dead.  Under those conditions, the concept of this place doesn't work.  It felt like eating at CPK at the mall.  \n\nThe food?  The food must be amazing, right?  Not so much.  The food was in the ballpark, but I've had better at lots of places.  \n\nThe service?  Apart from the clueless hostess, the service was good.  The wait staff was attentive but not overbearing.  They handled the meal fine. \n\nAll in all, I'm in no hurry to return to STK Las Vegas."

How could my steak be a disappointment!!?! :( BUT, everything else I ate was delicious and service was mostly on point.\n\nWhat to Love:\n_DJ keeps the party going. Ever fear that your day buzz will die at a nice Vegas dinner? STK DJ keeps it going with an awesome playlist.\n_Our server was a delight. We had to be out at a certain time to get to a show and he was on point with the timing. Also very friendly and helpful with a large group. We also had to do one separate bill and it was handled seamlessly.\n_Food: Scallops and Steak Tartare we DELICIOUS. As were the Kushi oysters. They tend to be one of my favs anyway and the quality here was fantastic.\n\nWhat could be better:\n_Despite a reservation and our entire group arriving we still had to stand around for 5 minutes. With 11 people in our reso it crowded the bar area since many other parties had to pass by us and clearly there were many empty tables around us. It made for an awkward start to the evening as you then also had 11 people trying to order drinks at the bar.\n_My filet :( Now, granted, I was eating a mountain of other appetizers with others, so I opted to split the 6oz filet with a friend so I could save room for drinks. When my filet arrived it definitely was not medium rare. They very handily split it for us, but my guess is it sat under a warmer for a bit while other food was finishing and thus overcooked/dried out which happened quickly since it wa sonly 6oz and it was cut in half. Normally if my steak arrives overdone I would bring it up to the server, but since we were on a time crunch I didn't have time to send it back.\n\nI hope to make it back again so I can give the steak another chance!"

I range from eating in the bar to private dining room with big groups to traditional seating.\n\nThe people that work there are outstanding.  While the girls at the front desk can be a bit flighty (don't judge the first impression), the management, bartenders,  and the servers are exceptional.  \n\nStart with an icy cold ketel martini or a moscow mule served in a copper mug at one of the two bars.  The scenery and people watching is generally off the hook.  The DJ, situated in the middle of the restaurant, plays a solid variety and keeps the energy level up.\n\nThe warm bread and green dipping sauce is sinful.  The Shellfish Platter comes in many sizes and has never let me down.  The entire menu can be relatively healthy and is not weighted down with butter and sauces but has great taste and flavor.  The tuna tartare, hamachi,  and shrimp rice krispies are my other go to starters.\n\nFor entrees, my fave by far is the filet prepared Pittsburgh Style.  Genius simple preparation and flavor every time.  Back this with broccolini, brussel sprouts and creamed spinach (again, solid ingredients but not buried in other sauces and concoctions).  Last few times, they have been bringing trays of their 8 steak sauces for sampling which have quite a variety.\n\nIf you like a cocktail, be sure to sample the Jalapeno shot.  Not on the menu but a mind boggling smoky infused gin beverage.  Terrific and reasonable wine list as well.\n\nFrom a cost perspective, my bill is generally 50-75% of many of the other restaurants I frequent in Vegas and the experience is better."

The filet with truffle butter is a must. And the strawberry drink with the graham cracker crust was delicious. I wish I could remember our waiters name but he was a very sweet guy who I think said he was from Texas, and he knew the menu like the back of his hand. It was also one of the bartenders birthdays so they brought a round of shots for the table and the host, waiter and bartender celebrated with us. They treated us like royalty.

Plated nicely but tastes as good as what I could throw together at home.  I probably wouldn't pay for it at this restaurant.

I know it is tough for a wait staff to get stuck with a 10 top but you shouldn't feel like you are being herded through a chow line.  We ordered creamed spinach as a part of our main course and when they served it, they conveyed it was saut\u00e9ed spinach.  When my wife asked if it was creamed spinach the other waiter conveyed he wasn't sure since he didn't serve it but given he had worked there for 5 years it looked like it to him. I conveyed that if he believed it was, that was fine, we just wanted to check.  His response came off snarky when it was simple/innocent question.  In total, the bill for my wife and I came to $300 and for the price we felt extremely rushed and hurried to leave.

Playlist was awful and did not match the vibe that the design offers.\n I couldn't even hear my server who was very kind...helpful.\n..and knowledgeable.  Thank you Mike!\nWay over staffed...which I'm sure had everything to do with the holiday and opening week...but they were just standing around like flies and chatting away...including management.  Didn't look professional and felt crowded.\nThere were only two restrooms that were unisex.  The attendant was not tending to them adequately.   The seats were wet and toilets weren't flushed.\n\nSome interesting food items on the menu but only a couple lived up to their hype.  Sauces were disappointing in comparison to their house sauce and some proportions were off for the elaborate or eccentric culinary menu items they were trying to accomplish.\n\nThe steaks were cooked to true temp and very good quality and the blue cheese dressing was gourmet.\n\nI didn't have a chance to look at the wines and the desert menu was minimal and not very creative.\n\nOverall. Think they need time to grow but then again...its Vegas and I hear that it is a fun late night place...but anywhere with cheap cocktail waitress dresses usually is.  I may try it again....but mainly because it is at my new favorite hotel!"

The steaks are great, even though I've had better at other spots on the strip- but the ambiance makes this place! Really cool decor and great drinks set it apart in my mind. Try it out if you happen to be staying at the Cosmo!!"

We stood there for 15 minutes as we watched other parties of two being seated ahead of us despite the fact they checked in after us AND we had reservations. Finally went back up to the desk to inquire and the girl working there asked why we hadn't checked in. I told them that we did 15 minutes ago and they bro-manager at the desk muttered \"It was like 10 minutes.\" At any rate, they quickly realized that no one had checked us in and seated us promptly after with no apology for the mix up. \n\nOur server on the other hand, was delightful. Very friendly and attentive. We started with the tartare and the beet salad. Both were yummy. The tartare had truffles shaved on it, so win in my book. My husband got the filet and I got the ribeye. He loved his filet, my ribeye was nothing to write home about. Definitely not the best steak I've ever had. The truffle fries, while good, were over hyped by the Yelpers on here. We also got the carrots and while they were good - they weren't amazing. \n\nI did love my cocktail. It had a bit of heat to it, which I really liked. \n\nOverall started out with a bad experience at check-in followed by a mediocre meal. We also got a stern email from Open Table as \"no-shows\" for our reservation. Icing on the mediocre cake."

My wife and I waited and waited and waited as we wanted a cocktail before our dinner reservation just to get the evening under way. Finally a wait person noticed us and it wasn't all that busy. The Gin Fizz eventually showed. It was fantastic and with cucumbers too. Exactly as depicted and delicious. I asked a passing waiter if the music was muted below ear splitting and annoying in the dining area? He said it's not really loud. Apparently he didn't hear my question!!!!\nWe eventually entered the dining area and I ordered the Bone in Filet with Mac & Cheese, mushroom pie, asparagus after a soft shell crab salad which my wife and I split. She ordered the Blue Tuna seared. All very very delicious. The Sommelier was perfect and on top of his game as was the wait person. Unfortunately we will never eat here again and cannot recommend unless you already have perforated ear drums and enjoy Alka Seltzer as an after dinner drink to cure a headache!!!\nOh, the music choices were incredibly good as I am most appreciative of the mix it's just that even upon complaint that the noise level was so loud, as did others in the restaurant, the manager declared that that is the theme! So, screw the patrons and stick with The Program you moron. Nobody said turn off the music just lower it to where you aren't brain damaged as the manager apparently is!!"

We had reservations for 7:45 for 3 people which we arrived promptly for only to be informed they had us down for 7:30 and that they were running at least  1/2 hour behind.  When you have tickets to a show in Vegas, having your restaurant running 1/2 behind is no bueno.  Little could be done, you can't just walk into another restaurant and be seating so we waited. They had no empathy and frankly had an uppity attitude about the whole thing.   I decided to get a glass of wine while we waited.  The girls behind the bar completely ignore female patrons.  I actually had to get the wine list from the gentlemen beside me.  Finally, a male bartender surfaced and I got my glass of wine. \n\nOnce seated, the entire experience changed and turned into what we were expecting.  Great vibe, great food, great wait staff, ready with info about Gluten free options.  Now if they could just get the front of their house and the bar in order, they'd be a premier restaurant in Vegas."

He even described which parts of a cow were cut for the types of steak meats. The bread was AMAZING.  I enjoyed the tuna tartar appetizer, but the best part of the meal was the steak.  I ordered the filet in bone and it was so tender, it cut with a regular knife. (I was wondering why they didn't give us steak knives)  Our water glasses were constantly refilled, and the wine selection was overwhelming. (in a good way)  We also enjoyed the cheesecake lollipop desserts.  The ambience was hip, and the music selection was good.

Awesome servers that know the menu inside and out. They do have a private room for groups up to 30 people I believe. What some people may view as negatives for STK I personally don't because I know what to expect and it's part of the experience. If you go as a twosome then you'll likely be sitting right in between two other couples in fairly close quarters. It's loud and busy. I enjoy going in a larger group, 4 or more, and sitting in a booth. Not the place you want to go for a quiet dinner. This is more of a pre party type of dinner or celebration dinner, in my opinion. You can see stars here if your timing is right. Halle Barry, Kevin Hart, Christy Mack and the list goes on and on. I always stay at the Cosmopolitan hotel when I visit Vegas and it's nice to have one of the most fun and beautifully decorated steak houses on the strip right there in the hotel. I highly recommend STK if it's the type of atmosphere that you are looking for."

It wasn't bad but it wasn't good.\n\nThe steak was very solid though.  Ordered rare + and it came out medium rare so that was fine.  Sort of underseasoned but I was able to fix that with the ton of pepper and salt the waitress brought over.  Overall the steak was good to very good but not Del Frisco's/Sparks level.  \n\nThe sides were pretty good as well, creamed spinach was nice in particular. \n\nThere are entirely too many options to ever head back to this place again but I would say if you're in the hotel and hungry it is a solid choice.

You pass the Cosmo's Chandalier Bar before you hit the entrance to STK so it sets up just the right mood.  The interior and atmophere is what I expect from an upscale Vegas restaurant.  It has unique decor, feels open, and has a clubby vibe to it.  \n\nWe got seated to our table as soon as we got there for our reservation (which doesn't always happen).  The waiter was also very patient and helpful in getting our drink order - not the easier task when a group of 8 girls is trying to decide which fruity drink to get. Haha.  The drinks were all fantastic, but I've never really had any complaints about drinks that I've gotten from Vegas.  The food, on the other hand, was a hit or miss.  Here's what we got: \n\nBREAD FOR THE TABLE:  O.M.G!  I'm sure all the other yelpers have commented on how amazing this bread is.  It even looks amazing - coming out in the shape of a muffin glazed with deliciousness with a green side dipping sauce that takes you back for a moment because it's green.  When you get over the awe and actually dig in to eat it, it just melts in your mouth - one of those crispy and buttery on the outside, and soft on the inside.  And that dipping sauce!!!  \n\nFOIE GRAS Appetizer: I indulged with Foie Gras ever since California banned it (not necessarily banned it completely, but it might as well have been with the restrictions).  I ordered both the appetizer and the side to go on top of my steak.  The foie gras was excellent - cooked perfectly - tender - juicy - fatty!  Unfortunately it was paired with a sweet element - I can't even remember what it was (applesauce, berries? no clue) - all I remember was that it DID NOT compliment well.  I separated the two and only focused on the foie gras.  \n\nFILET MIGNON with FOIE GRAS: Have already commented on the awesomeness of the foie gras and it didn't disappoint.  However, the piece that came with the entree was much smaller than the appetizer.  If I could go back, I'd order two appetizer ones, and save one to eat with the steak.  Unfortunately again, the filet mignon was overcooked and chewy.  Yes, you read right, CHEWY!  FILET MIGNON!  I was very disappointed.  STK is a STEAKhouse and their steak was actually the only thing I would not get again.  Maybe they were having an off night or an off-piece, but how do you mess up such a fine cut like filet!?!  \n\nMUSHROOM POT PIE:  This side dish was the highlight of our side dishes - a MUST GET!  It's a combination of probably 4-5 different mushroom type, baked under some dough to soak in all the delicious sauce.  It was one of those unique dishes that are not offered in many places, but tastes super awesome!  \n\nIf you have a big group and are celebrating an event, this place is a good option.  Be prepared to pay some big bucks (but hey, you're in Vegas!)."

Over here in LA, we have so many eateries and when we want a good steak and service, we always resort to Ruth Chris's. \n\nMy boyfriend and I made reservations to celebrate our 4 year anniversary. When I called the restaurant, I never told the hostess that we were celebrating anything and the next available reservation she had available was at 11:15. Ofcourse, it being a Friday night and in Vegas, we figured we could do a little bit of gambling at the casino before having dinner. We arrived at the restaurant around 11 and instantly, we loved the vibe of the restaurant and the beautiful decor. Normally, the bf and I would want a nice, quiet environment   for dinner since we're in our early 30s (yes, we're old!), but we figured, why not since we're in Vegas. The restaurant was busy, but filled with good music. We decided to grab a drink at the bar while waiting. I've been to Vegas many times and usually, it takes a while for a male to order a drink. The kind bartender instantly noticed my boyfriend and helped us out. Customer service is one of the biggest things we value when we go out to eat and if a place doesn't have good customer service, we usually aren't returning customers.  \n\nThe hostess sat us to our table and asked us if we were celebrating anything. We just responded that we were in Vegas for a wedding, but we decided to kill 2 birds with 1 stone and also celebrate our anniversary since we haven't been out in a while. Our server was named Luis acknowledged us immediately and served us some of their delicious and buttery bread. He explained to us the menu and also the sauces that we can add-on to our steak, if we wanted. I ordered the rib-eye, medium rare and the bf ordered the same thing. As sides, we ordered the broccolini and the mac and cheese. \n\n Our food came out on time but I noticed that my steak was cooked more on the medium well as I cut into it. I normally don't like to complain, and I wasn't going to, but our waiter Luis noticed that our steaks weren't what we had ordered and wanted to make things right. He took back our steaks and had new ones made. While our steaks were being made, the bf and I just snacked on the broccolini since we were starving. As soon as Luis brought back our new steaks, he brought out some new sides because he wanted our sides to be warm for our steaks. He kindly apologized about the food and also brought us some shots.\n\nOur steaks and our sides were absolutely delicious! The mac and cheese was creamy, the broccolini had a nice parmesan garlic flavor to it, and our steaks were cooked to perfection. I added a side of chimichurri sauce and that made my steak even more heavenly. As soon as we finished our meal, Luis found out from the hostess that we were celebrating an anniversary, and brought us a complimentary dessert! The desserts consisted of a warm apple crisp and a chocolate cheesecake. Both desserts were scrumptious and after eating there, I was afraid the zipper on my desk would rip! Lol. We ended up also chatting with another worker named Chris who gave us some recommendations on things to do that were nearby. He also explained how he enjoyed working at Stk because of how the staff feels like a family since they also hang out after work. \n\nLuis and Chris, you guys are amazing! One of you told us that anyone who comes in is treated like VIP at Stk, and I truly believe it. The food and the customer service is why we will be returning to eat there in the future, every time we make a trip out to Vegas. Thank you for making our 4 year anniversary very memorable for the both of us!"

Although I had made reservations, they quickly tried to shuffle me over to the bar to eat. When I protested, I was given a table with a waiter who was none to thrilled to have a solo, non-drinking diner. He was very curt and appeared to not have the time of day for me.\nHaving read reviews on yelp, I knew the bread was a must have. Holy Moly! The bread was divine and really made the meal memorable. In fact, I am still thinking of that bread a week later. The  creamed corn was also delicious and a thousand times more appetizing than my overcooked filet mignon with a runny bearnaise sauce. After ordering, I never saw the waiter again but you could tell he clearly wanted me out of there because I was offered the check before I was even asked if I wanted coffee and dessert, which of course, I did. The dessert, a peanut butter s'more would have been much more delicious if served warm/hot and it did not leave me wanting s'more. \nWould I recommend STK to a friend? Only if they were allowed to order just bread and creamed corn."

I don't usually order steak unless I have a mad craving AND I am super hungry (because I generally have a smallish appetite). \n\nBut when we decided to go for a nice dinner in Vegas for a friend's birthday, I made sure that my appetite was ready for some STK.\n\nI was not disappointed. They offer several portion sizes for all appetites. I ordered the small skirt steak with (upon recommendation for Yelpers) with the truffle butter topping.  Whoa. Who thought they one little slab of butter could open up a whole set up tastebuds that I never knew existed! \n\nBetween the 4 of us, we shared four sides (Mac and cheese, Yukon whipped potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and creamed spinach). All decent accompaniments for our steaks. But I def think we could have gotten away with only 3 as we were so full even from our steaks!\n\nTip:  Brussels sprouts and whipped potatoes brushed in your truffle butter drippings...do it.\n\nThe ambiance has a cool vibe...dark room, live dj. The best part - the music is awesome! We were there on a Saturday night and he played all 80s and 90s old skool hits! It was like a mini karaoke sesh with our dinner.\n\nThe downside to STK: it's not cheap...but then again, good quality food is priceless. And hello - it IS Vegas. Also, we were so full fr dinner we didn't have room for dessert which looked amazing.\n\nI will def prepare myself to go again and this time, save room for dessert!"

Very trendy place with a simple, but eye-popping menu.\n\nRecommend: Seafood Platter Appetizer. Jumbo Shrimp, crab legs, and lobster tail. Really good. Also, Filet steak(med/rare) with foie gras. \n\nStay away from: Lobster Mac-n-cheese. Taste like plain mac-cheese with frozen pieces of lobster mixed in there. Good, but not worth the $30 price tag. \n\nIf you are a late diner, they have a DJ so the restaurant is loud. We went during opening dinner hours, around 6:30pm, so we didn't have to battle the noise. BUT, ITS VEGAS, SO PARTY UP!"

Beyond the delicious entrees, fresh ingredients, and potent cocktails, the STK LV waitstaff has a knack for going above and beyond to ensure that all of their patrons are taken care of.\n\nOn multiple occasions, I've seen one of the floor managers, Zaban Furness, walk from table to table introducing himself, shaking hands with each guest at the table, and striking up brief comedic banter. Coming from someone who worked for Nordstrom for 5 years, I know very well the definition of real customer service and rapport building. Not only is Zaban and the rest of the STK staff the epitome of customer service, they are the embodiment of relationship building in the modern cuisine dining industry."

We had a central booth that comfortably fit our large party. As others have mentioned, the music is very loud but I didn't feel it overpowered our conversation and we all enjoyed the ambiance - it is Vegas after all! Our waiter was attentive and mentioned at the beginning of our service that the bar was backed up and it might be awhile until we get our drinks. No big deal. We placed our orders - salads as starters and various cuts of steaks for each member of the party. One of our favorite parts of the meal was the table bread and whatever the ridiculously magical green dipping sauce was that came with it - yum! My husband and I shared a blue cheese wedge salad - good, but nothing to write home about. For my entree, I ordered the 10 oz. filet with truffle butter on top. The steak was good, but I have eaten at enough wonderful steak restaurants to know that I have definitely had better. I'm also not sure the truffle butter was worth an additional $12. We also ordered a few sides for the table - our party seemed to enjoy the truffle fries and lobster mashed potatoes.\n\nThe meal itself was fine, albeit not impressive, but at least we were enjoying ourselves. This is when things took a turn for the worse. We had paid the well over $1,000 bill and ordered one additional round of drinks to savor the last few minutes of my birthday celebration. At this point, we had been at the table for a reasonable amount of time to feed 9 people, and like I had mentioned earlier, the only holdup was waiting for our drinks to come from the bar. As we were still enjoying the last sips of our drinks, the waiter came over the our table, leaned down to me (who he knew was the birthday girl) and my sister-in-law, and bluntly said \"I'm gonna need your table\". We seriously could not believe our ears. I've never in my life experienced such unprofessional behavior, especially after just spending a significant amount of money on an already sub par meal. If we had been lingering at the table too long, I could maybe understand - I get that you are a busy restaurant and it was a Saturday night. But we had literally just paid the bill and had every right to still be at the table at the time he said this. Maybe a better way to approach the situation would have been to ask politely if we wouldn't mind moving to the bar. I am incredibly disappointed that we came here for my birthday dinner, and it will be a night to remember for all the wrong reasons. It is their responsibility to schedule their reservations with a reasonable amount of time for people to enjoy their meals and the company they are with. I made this reservation well over a month in advance, and this was totally unacceptable. Because of this, I am NEVER eating here again and will make sure others know that this is how they treat their guests."

The Mac and cheese side and brocollini side also are fantastic to go with your steak.  I ended up getting the bone in filet, which was cooked to a perfect medium rare and I topped it with foie gras which complimented the steak perfectly.  For desert, we got the chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top, this was mouthwatering.

It was very sincere for her to do that for us. We walked in and we were already enjoying the music they were playing with their Very own DJ. I was already feeling this place already. We had to wait for about 15 minutes at the bar. We ordered a cocktail which cost about $20.

Our server was really nice and recommended a lot of delicious food. \n\nOur list of orders we had:\n1. Truffle fries-8/10- good portion and very crispy for about $13\n2. Beef carpaccio pasta-8/10-very thin slices of beef with a slight amount of pasta. Decent taste of the flavor.\n3. Foie gras-10/10- super delicious and I recommend. All he flavors balance so well and it was my first time trying it.\n4. Oyster 1/2 dozen-8/10-very small but super fresh and well worth it.\n5. Steak 20oz-10/10- never had a delicious steak ever since I came to this place. Very juicy and easy sliced. \n6. Wild mushroom-9/10-big portion, good side with your steak.\n\nIf you are willing to spend a lot for a good dinner, come to STK. not really a fancy place to dress nice for. just be decent when coming here.

Those times were just too early and too late. We passed by the place around 4 and tried to bribe our way to get a table around 7 and the hostess told us that there was a section (the tall tables) that are first come first serve and they usually fill up by 7. So, we left and two of us came back at about 6:20pm and got a table easily. Out of about 12 or so, after us, there were only 2 tables left and they filled up in 10 min...so if you can't reserve a table, arrive around 6 to get a tall table!\n\nService was great all night by the busser and waitress. Cleared dirty dishes out quickly and checked on us often. We did bring a bottle of wine ourselves and was told that there was a $50 corkage fee. My friend complained to the waitress saying it was BS to charge that much to open a bottle and politely asked if she could ask her manager to not charge him (since he was a Cosmo VIP guest) or at least reduce the fee. The manager reduced it to $25.\n\nAtmosphere was cool, they have a live DJ playing and he was spinning 80's music the whole time, that was dope. Definitely an upscale resto. They say you're supposed to dress formal/\"nice\" but I came in jean booty shorts, a cropped top and black flats. Other girls were dressed like they were going to a winter formal. \n\nWe started off with a dozen of half shell oysters, they were pretty small. Ordered the mac and cheese, it was alright (not a huge mac and cheese fan but the others loved it). Ordered the truffle parmesan fries, these were thicker fries than I thought but they were really good! And for my entree, I ordered the porterhouse to share with my friend because it was such a huge dish. Also got the red wine bbq? sauce on the side, and omg, it was sooooooooo good!! I dipped everything in that sauce! haha. Also ordered the stiletto cucumber cocktail, it's pretty minty, it was good. Friends ordered the chocolate cocktail, not a huge fan of chocolate..but if you're a chocolate lover, this one's for youu!\n\nOverall, everything was great! Great service, great food, great atmosphere! Would def come back! Bill came out to about $400, yes very pricey. The best part of it all, the whole meal was comp'd. #WIN."

To put this into perspective, imagine the table next to you, you would be literally be 2-3 inches away from their elbow.  \n\nForget holding a conversation.

After about 5 minutes I was able to flag down a busboy and inform him that we were missing 2 dinners. It took him a few minutes to hunt down our waiter and a few more minutes to bring out the food. Now our steaks have been sitting on the table for over 10 minutes while we waited for everyone to be served. And to top it off the waiter hides from us for the rest of the night and never apologizes. But you can be sure that our bill included the 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more.\nI guess since our tip was locked in the service was not important.\n\nI also want to mention the hostess Lily and busboy Rupert were very helpful and should  be commended, they were the only ones who cared enough to apologize.\n\nTo top it all off we were charged a $50 corkage fee.

Let me tell you, it was probably the strangest dinner I have ever been to. I felt like I was in some type of music video or commercial. The patrons and servers were so over saturated with enthusiasm that there had to be a director near by yelling \"action\" from the top of his lungs! I mean, he had to yell because you couldn't hear your own thoughts over the music the DJ had streaming over every table and like clockwork he had an ultra-annoying horn blow ever few minutes. As if that were not enough, every few seconds there was a voice reminding us that the guy controlling the sounds was a \"world-class DJ.\" There were girls fist-pumping, servers dancing while pouring wine, and people grinding between tables. I think I actually rubbed my eyes to make sure I was not dreaming! I grew up in Vegas, by way of the military (my dad was in the Air Force). I don't know if Las Vegas has always been like this or I can now see how semi-cheesy it is... Whatever the case, people were having fun and that was nice. More pics on my blog"

As for the food, AMAZING.  Bone in rib eye is a must..and since I live in California..the best part is you can top add a nice piece of foie gras on top of your steak...along with some truffle butter if you really want to splurge!  Also get the lobster risotto with white truffle shavings while you can for a side!  Corn pudding is amazing here too.  For dessert, captain crunch bread pudding!! what more can you ask for!!

Which probably keeps the energy and atmosphere high no matter where you are. \n\nThe steaks here are as good as any upscale steakhouse, maybe not top end liks Mastro's, but right in line with Fleming's, and Boa (I'm not a fan of Boa though). Nothing that will blow your socks off in terms of quality, but nothing to really complain about considering the prices you're about to pay. \n\nNo issues about coming back, but wouldn't seek this place out if it wasn't nearby."

I saw a lot of complaints on here about having to wait a long time before being seated, but we were sat within 5 minutes of arriving for our 8:00pm reservation. \n\nThe bread that they bring out for table is absolutely amazing. There's a blue cheese glaze that the covers the bread and its fresh out of the oven. We literally plowed through the bread in about 10 minutes.\n\nI then ordered the Kobe sliders for the main course. They were very small, but absolutely delicious. I was still full from lunch, so the small portion was perfect for me. My buddies all enjoyed their meals and one even said the chicken dish was some of the best he ever had. \n\nThe music was loud and we loved every minute of it. This is Vegas and if you're looking for a low key experience, you're definitely in the wrong place. The vibe of the restaurant is upbeat, trendy and gets you warmed up for the night ahead. It's definitely expensive, but you're paying for the atmosphere and crowd that comes with it. \n\nIt was my friends birthday as well so I mentioned it to the staff and they brought out a complimentary piece of cake for him with a bday candle.\n\nOverall I had an excellent experience at this place.

They get rather packed most evenings so plan for a wait, or you can always grab some open seating in the bar.\n\nI have enjoyed almost everything I have tried here. Although I am blanking on a name they serve an amazing bread appetizer with sides of dipping sauce. I want to say it is the foie gras french toast but do not quote me on that.  Aside from that I like the caesar salad (Traditional, but I like that it is prepared with large pieces of romain vs chopped, and with fresh parmesan) For entrees I really enjoy the sea bass (When it is offered) and the chicken. You can select your sides to accompany your entree, I recommend the mac and cheese (Creamy and tasty) truffle fries (So good!) Or the mashed potatoes. As a desert person, you know I have to put in my 2 cents on these. The espresso charlotte is amazing. I have also tried the cheesecake pops, which are rather simple but good non the less.\n\nOverall I really like STK.

As such, STK was never high on my list of places to eat in Vegas.  I ended up going for a business dinner and was generally pleased, even for my steak-averse palate.\n\nPros\n*The appetizers were amazing.  Hands down.  Everything we ordered was fantastic and they actually gave us the appropriate number of items based on the people at the table (might have been coincidence but I'll give them the point)\n*The music selection was late 90's and early 2000's that reminded me of days gone by.  It was not what you normally hear at a club or a restaurant so it was a fun change of pace\n*The drinks were fantastic and we were always asked about a fresh one before our glasses were empty\n*The steak!  I know!  I said it.  It was a pretty good steak.  I only had a few bites of someone else's but it was the complete opposite of where my mind goes when I think about steak.\n\nSo far this review has been high-fives and kudos.  But that two star rating up there, that wasn't a mistake.  Every cloud has its silver lining, and at STK there were plenty of dark clouds to go with those small positive notes.\n\nCons\n*The volume of the music is insane.  It started out manageable but we were basically shouting at each other by the time we left\n*The drink I ordered was $18, and that seemed to be about average\n*The sides were hit or miss.  Asparagus was cold but the truffle fries were like pillows of potatoey goodness.  The gratin was basically raw potatoes but the mushroom pot pie was flavorful, hot, and exotic tasting\n*The service.  Our waiter was great.  Friendly, outgoing, ready to make recommendations.  Unfortunately, after he took our order he was gone and never to be seen again.  Instead we ended up with a loitering busser.  \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this was a business dinner.  We were there to eat, of course, but we were also talking and enjoying our evening.  I guess we took too long to finish our appetizers because the server asked us no less than three times if he could clear anything away.  Every time we said no and he just slipped to the side and waited there.  It was like he was counting mississippi's in his head until he could ask us again.\n\nSo we've finished our entrees.  We ordered a shared dessert and coffee.  We're winding our evening down when the manager comes over to the table.  I assumed that he was there to just say thank you since I'm sure our bill was near the $1000 mark for the evening.  Turns out he was basically kicking us out of our seat.  He said the restaurant was at capacity and he wanted to buy us a drink at the bar so we could free up the table.\n\nI'm sure there are people in Vegas who wish that their restaurants could be so full at 8pm on a weeknight that they are at capacity, but I can't tolerate being rushed from our table just because other people want to sit down.  I've waited at restaurants for over an hour because people weren't getting up and leaving, and that's just the way it goes.  If you dont like the wait time you go elsewhere.  It was really poor form that the manager asked us to vacate the table (after the check had been paid, mind you).\n\nOverall I am disappointed with STK.  I went into the experience expecting stellar service and mediocre food.  Turns out the food was the surprise winner and the service was just leaving much to be desired."

            "review": "My first experience with STK was at the NYC location, and I was hardly surprised when they decided to bring an STK to my current digs in Los Angeles -- a city that has its fair share of trendy restaurants that lack culinary inspiration. Suffices to say I was less than shocked when I heard the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas would also feature an STK restaurant. \n\nMy experiences at all three locations have been markedly different. The NYC location boasted good food and a classy atmosphere in the Meatpacking District (an area which wasn't hurting for culinary hot-spots at the time) and was able to deliver consistently, even in its nascent stages (I moved out of NYC shortly after it opened so I wasn't able to see how the restaurant fared in the later stages of its existence). While the steaks left something to be desired, the restaurant was trendy and the overall experience was fun. I'll unabashedly add that, hands down, the best steaks still come from Texas. \n\nWhen the Los Angeles restaurant opened, I was happy to see that same ambiance maintained, but unfortunately, the food was inconsistent at best (definitely nothing to write home about) and it's \"trendiness\" quickly declined within its first year. STK LA's biggest redeeming quality was (and still is) its proximity to other LA nightlife hotspots, and the location is enough to get me there with a group of friends for some cocktails and light appetizers to kick the night off. \n\nFast forward to 2011 and the latest trendy hotel in Vegas, the Cosmopolitan, now boasts its very own STK. A group of us made up of my closest friends from Texas, New York and California were staying at the hotel for the weekend to celebrate my birthday, so we decided to check out STK. I tried making a resie through the hotel but, annoyingly, the restaurant handles its own reservations and my call was promptly directed to their hostess. Getting a reservation was easy enough -- I called 4 days in advance of our arrival -- and we figured 9:30pm would be a good time to eat before an insanely late night of dancing. Our group of 4 arrived on time and the hostess informed us that the wait would be half an hour...with a reservation. Disgruntled, but determined not to let the unfortunate news spoil our mood, we proceeded to the bar to have some very expensive, very plain drinks -- if you are price-sensitive and like to imbibe, then this is not the restaurant for you. \n\n45 minutes later, we were seated and STARVING. This is when things got exponentially better. Our servers were incredibly fun, enthusiastic and attentive. Throughout the entire meal, our waitress helped us by making great recommendations, taking photos of us to help commemorate the trip, and showering us with an endless supply of complimentary birthday shots as well as a celebratory dessert plate, replete with delectable bite-sized cake and ice-cream lollipops. Crisis averted. Be sure to request Raquel M. as your server -- Raquel and her fellow cohorts will make sure you have a blast. The restaurant manager even let us explore the kitchen, meet the chef, observe the plating ritual and peruse all the fresh ingredients. The kitchen was very clean and well managed and the staff was very friendly. \n\nThe giant seafood platter we ordered was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone but me (I'm picky, obvi) --  the king crab was a little soggy for my taste and the oysters left me underwhelmed -- and the steaks were actually better than the ones I had at the NYC and LA locations. I ordered the ribeye medium rare and the cut and flavor were excellent. Still not on par with Texas steaks, but as far as the STK chain goes, I really enjoyed my meal.\n\nNet/net, while the steaks at STK restaurants are not my favorite, the ambiance is usually pretty fun and the staff at the Las Vegas location absolutely made this experience worthwhile. If you are staying at the Cosmopolitan and/or looking for a fun/trendy place to eat before you head to Marquee, this is the place to go."

I think they pair it with some type of chimichirri  sauce and I loved it.\n\nNow for the main event.  I looked at the menu and was a little overwhelmed.  Luckily our waitress told us about the specials for the day.  I ordered one of the specials which was a \"Prime Rib Cap\". The other one was some type of steak with crab meat on top.  I can't eat shellfish, so I just decided on the other.  When I got the prime rib cap, I thought it was pretty good, but not for the cost.  I think it was like $55-65, but I guess I've had better steak for that price.  Along with my steak, I ordered the truffle mac and cheese.  Er man gawd, this thing was amazing and I literally had to stop myself from eating the entire thing.  Sooooo worth the extra cost to add on the truffles.  Fair warning, you might keep the entire thing for yourself.\n\nI ordered some type of drink and totally forgot what it was.  I think it was some type of jalape\u00f1o drink from their menu and it was ok. \n\nJust me alone, I spent over $100 without tip.  So, prepare yourself to pay some $$$ for this place.  I think there's more hype to it than it's worth.  Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, but I've had better."

The description suits this restaurant since it is conveniently located one level above Marquee Nightclub.  If you're a health nut then this place is not for you as most items on the menu are super rich in flavor and sauces and/or grease.  On the most recent trip I had the 10 oz loin steak as entree plus sides of the sweet corn pudding, mushroom pot pie and Parmesan truffle fries.  Appetizers we had were the crispy lobster tails, lil burgers and a tomato caprese salad.  All in all the meal was quite satisfying but definitely a bit overpriced as the bill came out to around $250 for the three of us but I guess the atmosphere makes up for it.  Only issue I have is sometimes the music is too loud and makes it hard to have a conversation while dining."

We walked around the Cosmopolitan and stopped by STK. We were well greeted at the front desk and took us to our seat. The server was nah... he was pushy for us to get alcohol drinks and appetizers. We do not drink alcohol and we were pretty hungry so we asked for 2 non-alcoholic drinks and entrees with 2 side dishes and its famous sauces. HE TOTALLY LOOKED DOWN ON US. YOu can totally see in his eyes he was insulting us that we were sooo cheap. Well, I am a very straight forward person. If I am hungry, I will order a lot but if I am not, why should I just order food and look rich? We were offered with Blue cheese bread which was pretty good but my skirt steak was not the greatest. I had better.... My meat had a taste... like strong meat taste which I could not stand. I ate little.\nMy husband got the Bone-in Rib Eye, he said he got better... Well, to summarize, if you want to be looked down because you haven't ordered all plates on the menu + alcohol drink or a bottle of wine, then try it. If you want a pleasent and a prefect steak, please stop by Maestro or Fleming's. We had much better experience over there!\nBTW, we are Fleming's regular customer  =)\n\nSTK - RUDE SERVER + MEDIOCRE FOOD!"

Genuinely friendly, beautiful, great at what they do, it makes suffering through the 150 decibal sound system all worth it. And Shady has to admit, with all the scenery the food is actually very good. This year Shady took down the lamb chops which were cooked perfectly and delicious on one night, and the sirlion on another. Coupled with some nice red's, the great girls behind the bar, and the scenery all around, STK is just a great night out in Vegas. Shady has been a regular here since it opened 3 years ago, and as long as Shady's ladies are there, so is Shady. Just please, after 1000 reviews suggest you lower the music just a tad, please listen to the people."

This restaurant blends the nightclub atmosphere with a fancy steakhouse and does it well.  It is not very large, so if coming on a weekend, you need a reservation but if you happen to be in town during the week you shouldn't have an issue finding a table.\n\nThe prices here are what you'd expect at a fancy steakhouse and will run you about $100 a person on the average.\n\nI had the bone-in rib eye and it was cooked a perfect medium and melted in your mouth.  It was one of the better cooked steaks I've had in a long time and tasted delicious.\n\nI chose the Cauliflower Gratin which was just OK.  It just didn't have much flavor.  I feel maybe some salt would have helped, or perhaps using salted butter instead would have given it enough of an oomph it so desperately needed.\nWe also had the Mac & Cheese at the table as a recommendation by the server and while it was creamy (I always like my mac creamy), it still didn't wow anyone.  Both our sides fell flat on all 3 of us at the table and we agreed we should have either had no sides or picked others.  We didn't even bother boxing the left overs to go.  This is where this place loses a star for me.\n\nService was great!  Everyone was on their toes refilling waters and delivering food on time and in order.\n\n\nWould I come back here?  Not sure.  With the amount of amazing steakhouses in Las Vegas, it is a very tough decision on where to go each visit.  If I stayed at Cosmo again, I'd definitely consider it."

We had made reservations at STK and let me tell you, I can't recall a more fun, more awesome dinner experience I've ever had.  Everything, from the moment we walked in to the moment we stepped out, was perfect!\n\nIt was packed, it was loud, and it was busy.  So if you're looking for a quiet place to have a meal, turn around and go to grammas' house!\n\nWe got there a little early and bellied up to the bar for a round of drinks.  Pricey?  Yeah!  Worth it? !@#$ yeah!  Nothing watered down here folks.  Stiff drinks served in large glasses.  Some of the ladies in our group were feeling the effects after their first drink.  We sat at a large, comfy table in the main dining area right near the bar.  We were greeted by the best waitress/server I've seen in a long time; Michelle.  She was great.  Friendly, professional, attentive, knowledgeable, sweet, hot, fun, the whole package.  I took charge of the appetizers and we had a large seafood platter with crab, lobster, shrimp, oysters, sauces, and all kinds of other goodies.  I ordered 4 different salads for the table to share.  I roll with a pretty picky bunch when it comes to food.  I didn't hear a single complaint and all the appetizer plates were cleaned off!\n\nTime for the entrees.  I ordered the \"24 oz. porterhouse, medium rare, sliced off the bone please\"!  OMG! Hot, juicy, perfectly marbled, sliced against the grain, so every beefy, juicy, fatty morsel was an explosion of flavor in my mouth.  The sides were also wonderful.  The creamy Yukon potatoes, the parmesan truffle fries, the mushroom pot-pie, and of course, the mac n' cheese.  Each one brought a new element of flavor and texture to the party.  I don't have a negative thing to say about any of the food.  We all ordered different cuts of meat.  Some had the petite fillet, the cowboy rib-eye, the bone-in fillet, one of the ladies even ordered the roasted Dover sole! ( I take no responsibility for that one, but when she wasn't looking, I took a piece and that too was delish!)  Dessert time.  Michelle approached me and asked me if we'd like to see a dessert menu.  I told her it was my friend's birthday.  She simply said. \"Would you like me to take care of it?\"  Awesome!  That is exactly what I wanted to hear.  She took the initiative and made it happen.  A large tray with an assortment of desserts showed up a few minutes later with \"Happy Birthday\" inscribed in chocolate across the platter with candles.  Perfect.  I love it when a server takes control, shows leadership and \"hooks it up\".  All I remember is taking a spoonful of bread pudding, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, drenched in a warm caramel sauce topped with what I think was Cap'n Crunch cereal and thinking to myself, \"Now, I can die!\".\n\nIn all honesty, I've had a better steak at CUT or Mastro's in Beverly Hills, but this steak is a very close second.  But neither CUT nor Mastro's (in the numerous times that I've been to each) even comes close to the service we got and the fun time we had at STK. NOT! EVEN! CLOSE!\n\nNow, for the party that broke out in the restaurant during dinner.  This is where the fun comes in.  The resident DJ was inspiring!  He played the coolest, hippest, most fun, and most want-to-get-out-of-your-seat-and-sing-and-dance-along music ever!  From Sinatra, Bon Jovi, Journey, Kid Rock, Joan Jett, Jay-Z, Lady Ga-Ga, Madonna.  He turned this already loud and happening restaurant into a full blown night club.  We and the three or four tables around us were up and singing and dancing and jumping, and laughing, and drinking, and hugging like it was a wedding or something.\n\nThe nine of us all agreed, this was the most fun, and most memorable dinner experience we've ever had.  The next time you go to Vegas with a large group, go to STK, ask to sit in Michelle's section and be ready to party!\n\nThank you STK, Michelle and the rest of your team.  You guys gave us a night we'll never forget."

While you do get your money's worth, the thickness and chunkiness reminded me of three pieces of spam stacked on one another. Foie Gras is just so rich. It should be enjoyed as a delicacy, not a monstrosity. And while foie gras is typically served with toast. Being mixed with sweet french  toast and caramelized apples, was  like an episode of Jersey Shore - a hot mess with just too much going on. \n\nMain Dishes: \n7 Oz Skirt Steak - $25\n12 Oz Skirt Steak- $32\n-- for the quality of the steaks, not worth it. The dipping sauce reminded me of A-1. Really, nothing spectacular. \n\nSides: \nFoie Gras Topping - $15 - Tip - this worked better with the steak. However, it was the same amount as the appetizer (2.5 ounces). Do yourself a favor if you do want to try the foie gras appetizer,  just order the appetizer and not the topping as well. you'll have more than enough to save some for the steak probably. \n\nTruffle Fries - $10 -  the fries are extremely thick jenga style sized fries. I think truffle works better on shoe string fries. I could not really taste the truffle. \n\nMushroom Pot Pie - $10 - the server takes the fun out of a pot pie. I was excited to dig into it, but they go ahead and do the fun part for you. The server will cut the top open and spill the mushroom filling out and over the crust which will become a soggy mess. the little pastry you actually get was extremely salty. \n\nAmbiance - Decor and service was great. Music is REALLY loud. Being a music lover and person who does not mind night clubs, I actually didn't mind. But I can understand how many people would be put off by this. So be forewarned: not a romantic or quiet dinner spot. \n\nOveralll - great place to grab pre-dinner drinks/meet up with folks before headed out, but not a great place for an actual dinner.\n\nIf everything was about $5-$10 dollars cheaper, it would be okay. \nQuality and price of food did not match up."

The meat was very tender and what I loved more about it was that their lamb didn't taste gamey at all. You can still tell it was lamb but it didn't have that strong lamb taste to it. We also got a couple of super delicious sides, the truffle parmesan fries, which comes in brick form, and the very creamy corn pudding. Oh yeah, and a plate of asparagus too, which was pretty much mediocre at best. \n\nOverall, STK has it going on. The ambiance, people and food made our dinner worthwhile.

The steaks were very tender but lacked any real flavor, they were cooked to an exact medium rare. The Yukon mashed potatoes were a bit on the soupy side and had no form. The Mac and cheese was just that. It was like they took cooked macaroni and topped it with some cheese and baked it. It was not at all creamy and rich. My colleague and I both commented that we tasted neither orange nor jalape\u00f1o in the asparagus sauce.\n\nOn a side note-I tried to go to the restroom but the line was so long that I was told to come back later. I'm not really sure if the guy who told me that worked there or he just had to go really badly.\n\nFinally, there these three huge bouncer type guys who looked like they were in charge. As soon as the waiter brought the check I was signing when I heard one of these big mooks say to a group of four standing behind us, \"Yeah, these are your seats. I'm just waiting for these guys to get outta here.\" I thought it was very rude. From sit down to exit we were there an hour and five minutes.

Oysters, shrimp, king crab and ceviche....the oysters were well-shucked and tasty, about two per person....shrimp, one per person, overcooked and tough, the crab was skinny and dry and the ceviche was a joke(garlic and citrus flavors were conspicuously weak), I had to ask for more chips, which were thin and poorly suited texture wise as an accompaniment.\n\nWedge salad next($16.00), too creamy, bacon was decent, but not of the best flavor/quality.  The dish was \"ok\"...was hoping for excellent.\n\nGot the Free range chicken (maybe 1/3rd of small chicken) with polenta fries....it was exceptionally tasty, and a fabulous deal at $29.00.  Tried my friend's steaks and was glad I went with the chicken.  We shared broccoli, truffle fries and asparagus for the table, all $12.00 and all meh.\n\nThey did give me a complimentary chocolate mousse for my birthday, and the staff was very polite and professional, but by the time we were at dessert, I was ready to bolt, and have to say for Las Vegas steakhouses, this is a bottom tier player."

Being in the Cosmopolitan, my expectations were high but STK totally surpassed them!\n\nWhile waiting for our table, we started off for drinks at the bar and the bartender was incredible! He made the best drinks and I guess he overheard us talking about how we were celebrating my birthday so he made us a round of blueberry kamikaze shots on the house. Seriously...one of the best shooters I've ever tasted! Amazing! \n\nWe were then seated and although the server took a bit long to welcome us, he made up for it through the night. I think his name was Collin? Definitely request him, if you can! \n\nI got the seared tuna and usually tuna can be dry even if it gets just a bit overcooked but this tuna was perfection! One of the best tuna dishes I've ever had! Can't really comment on everyone else's dishes but they look yummy and everyone seemed to enjoy them.\n\nOverall we had 3 rounds of drinks at the bar, 2 bottles of wine, 4 entrees, and 1 side dish between 4 people. Luckily, it was my bday dinner so I didn't take a look at the bill but I wouldn't hesitate at all to come here again!\n\nThe vibe of the restaurant was so fun too! I've been to many steakhouses, even a few Michelin awarded ones but they're usually dreary. STK was so fun though! The music was great and honestly, every table looked like they were having a blast! Good drinks, good food, good music, good company...what more can you ask for?!"

It is Vegas and a restaurant in one of the fanciest hotels on the strip so what do you expect?  Great service and a great atmosphere comes with a price.  Maybe I am bias because I didn't take care of the bill though =) \n\nDefinitely a vibrant bar scene, drinks in hand and socializing. The scene here is kind of confusing though.  I would say a mixed crowd, definitely older.  It is a nice getaway from the typical Vegas scene with the large groups of barely dressed girls club hopping and shuffling from guestlist to guestlist.  It seems like a great place for romantic dinners, great for girls night, good for groups, \"CHEERS\" with the guys, but then you have some people dancing on chairs and tables as if it's a club?  The music and live dj adds to the whole ambiance but it's interesting when people get kind of rowdy.  But alcohol does that to all of us huh? \n\nFood.  Everything we had was delicious.  \n\nwine -- great recommendation\n\nbread -- love the green sauce\n\nbeef carpaccio -- thinnest slices of beef I've ever had!  Great texture and the flavors mixed well  \n\nfoie gras french toast -- if you eat this wrong, it'll taste wrong.  you have to get a little bit of everything in the same bite and chew it all together.  it's surprising, i loved it\n\npumpkin ravioli -- some people might not like the texture of pumpkin, but i love it!  it's a refreshing taste in my opinion\n\norganic filet mignon and bone in filet -- both were delicious and cooked exactly how i wanted it, can't complain, i think the bone in is better, but both were great \n\nlobster was good, but not stand out in comparison to the rest of our meal\n\nsides: we got the mac and cheese, sweet corn pudding, mushroom pot pie, and spiced maple carrots.  the standouts were the mushroom pot pie and sweet corn pudding\n\ndessert: the sorbets come out in small scoops and small cones (SO CUTE, but careful, i dropped the scoop a few times), the cheesecake pops and chocolate mousse were okay.  I don't remember what else we had, but none of them were standout or maybe we were TUMMY STUFFED. \n\nRecommendations: mushroom pot pie, foie gras french toast, bone in filet.  Also the music seems to get louder as the night got later so take that into consideration, like an earlier dinner date vs trendy rowdier scene later"

It's a total bar setting with people hunched over tiny tables cutting into their steaks. The meat is decent but also very expensive. The sides which you have to pay for separately are very small and bland. Also the drinks are the same price as they are downstairs at Marquee, yes...$500 for a bottle of Goose. Really? Why?"

Of all the nice steakhouses I've eaten in Vegas, STK is the only one who did not acknowledge the special occasion reason noted on our open table reservations. \n\nI had the 7oz filet medallions medium which was not cut so it left me a bit confused. I figure medallions would be sliced when served. It was nothing special. Not juicy. Not melt in your mouth delicious. It was just a piece of filet. \n\nBirthday boy had a 10oz filet medium rare with the foie gras topper. The foie gras was a pretty generous portion. He savored his meal saying it was nice and buttery. \n\nThe other 2 guys eating healthy chose the ahi tuna rare which was a big portion. It could've been shared between the two of them. They said it was good and fresh. \n\nThe sides: first off the server told us we should all order our own bc it was too small to share. At $11 a side you wonder wth? Not family style like most steakhouses?! So we got the broccolini, green beans, and mushroom potpie. When the sides came out I admit they were small but not so small you couldn't share. So the guys felt hustled by our server haha. The broccolini wasn't bad, the jalepeno gave it a spicy kick. I liked the soy glaze on the green beans. Then the mushroom potpie... Oh man! Yes I have to agree with other reviews this is a must order for sides. Another item on this trip that was worth one of my diet cheats. The cream sauce was rich but not overpowering and the mushrooms are a mixture of various kinds which was neat. The crust was flaky and light. \n\nOverall I will not be going back to STK. I'd prolly only go back for the mushroom potpie. Nothing spectacular but a decent dinner. Birthday boy enjoyed it. He also enjoyed the complimentary bread and parsley butter. I had a tiny piece and it was good! \n\nSo there you have it. STK was only good for mushroom potpie and free bread hence the reason for no pics bc it wasn't worthy. Ha!"

Other places around town try to pull off the same \"cool kid\" vibe but, unlike those spots, STK has some great food. I've heard from others how loud it can get, but we dined on a Tuesday night and, while it was busy, the music was at a decent volume -- low enough that we didn't have to yell at each other to have a conversation. I was hoping to sit in the main dining area where they have nothing but booths, but we were seated in front of the bar in a loungey-type area with mostly 2- and 4-tops.\n\nThe bleu butter bread that they start you out with was warm, fresh, and delicious. The half-dozen Kusshi oysters ($18) we had next were mild, meaty, and excellent. The pea agnolotti ($15) had an overpowering pea taste and, unfortunately, not enough of the goat cheese or pistachios that accompanied it. \n\nThe final appetizer we had was their tuna tartare ($19). Sure, it's a common dish found in almost every restaurant these days, but their version is very good. Fresh chunks of tuna were sitting in a corn tuille, which added a bit of sweetness to the dish and a crunchy texture. The avocado cream under the tuille had cayenne pepper (I think?) that added a kick.\n\nMy wife has been eating less and less lately, so we split the 14 oz. bone-in filet ($52). Wow! You had me at \"bone-in\"... drool-worthy, nom-worthy... hell, it's even sponge-worthy. One of the most tender and amazing filets I've had. We got the blue butter sauce with it, but really there was no need to put anything else on the steak.\n\nWe got a side of haricot vert ($10) -- or green beans as ordinary folk like me call it -- that was tasty and firm. Not the slightest bit overcooked or soggy. The portions are large, so plan on sharing among three or four.\n\nService was a bit spotty. Our waiter was nice enough, but he had at least six tables and was constantly running around. Meaning we didn't see him often. We sat around for almost half an hour before ordering our food. A little help for the wait staff might not be a bad idea.\n\nFor all you Top Chef fans, Stephen Hopcraft (formerly of Michael Mina's Seablue) is the executive chef. But, whether you're a fan of the show or not, the bone-in filet is reason enough to stop by.\n\n4.5 Stars"

It is super \"trendy\" and \"clubby\", which is weird for a steakhouse, but can also be a really fun pre-party place.  Pre-party as in, pre-Marquee..however, who wants to go clubbing on a full stomach? \n\nAnyway, the restaurant is really dark and they have BLARING house music on so that you canNOT hear anyone who isn't directly in a position where you can shout into their ear during conversation.  The table we were sat at is one of those U-shaped booths, so that your entire party is facing into the restaurant, not each other.  I hate those booths!  So with the seating arrangement and the loud music, I ended up only talking to 2 of the girls I was with in our party of 8.  Lame.\n\nThe food was really just okay.  Midway through dinner the girls at a table near us started dancing on their table and the counter behind their booth and swigging champagne out of the bottle.  Classy.  I would say that if you're part of a younger crowd just looking for a fun pre-party dinner, this is a good spot.

We then ordered a bottle of champagne (we were celebrating our friend getting married!).\n\nAppetizers:\n- Heirloom Tomato Salad ($20): burrata, tomatoes, olive oil & balsamic.\n*this was my appetizer and it was delicious! But I'm a sucker for anything with burrata.\n-Blue Iceberg Salad ($15): smoked bacon, blue cheese, picked tomato.\n*Friend ordered this one.  I tasted it.  The blue cheese dressing was yummy an so was the bacon.\n*Beef Tartare ($20): black truffle, sliced radish, soy caramel\n*Friend ordered this one and loved it!\n*Foie Gras French Toast ($24): green apple, almond brioche, sherry gastrique\n*Friend also loved this one!\n\nMain Entrees:\n-Skirt Steak, 7 oz. ($29)\n*I ordered this cooked as medium rare plus.  I have never ordered skirt steak from a restaurant but this was delicious!!  Great flavor, perfectly cooked.\n-Filet Medallion, 7 oz. ($37)\n*Friend ordered this medium rare.  I tried a piece and this was my favorite out of the three steaks.\n-I don't remember the third steak, but she got it with the peppercorn crusted, which was tasty.\n\nFor the side, we had the parmesan truffle fries ($11).  They were cut like steak fries, but crispy and oh so yummy!\n\nOur waitress was great and brought out some desserts for our celebration: little cheesecakes, 3 mini ice cream cones and their bread pudding.  OMG their bread pudding!  So yummy!!!\n\nI think our bill came to $498 total.  Would definitely head there again!\n\nFun atmosphere; it got louder as we left (around 8:30pm) and the service was fantastic.\n\n*Note: everything is a la carte, but enough to share!"

They informed us the reason they didn't have a bigger table available was because of our 10 minute late arrival. Fine... It was almost impossible to get in contact with our waiter. He wasn't rude but just very very busy and with the loud music playing it made it even harder. I really enjoyed their choice of music but it was just too loud for restaurant. Especially a resturant where the waiters don't really go above and beyond to make sure you're party is ok. \n\nThe food was actually pretty good not the best but pretty good. Our bill was about $600 but for that price I really wish the waiters and servers would've went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed ourselves and had everything we needed. \n\nOh! Also, they charged us $25 for the birthday sparkler and a slice of cake I assumed it was free but it definatly showed up... I wish we knew ahead of time. Might of skipped it."

Making a reservation here was a bit difficult as I understand it, but we had a nice big table for the 7 of us. Service is definitely slow, though. I don't think our waiter came over to greet us let alone find out if we wanted alcohol, water, or anything for a good 15- 20 minutes. If this were my parents' dinner, they'd have walked out. But we were slightly more patient, instead asking the bus boy to bring us water. A few of the other girls had time to go to the bar and order cocktails and seat themselves again before our waiter decided to come on over. \n\nFood wise, we shared a variety of appetizers. The scallops were yummy, but the toast they sat on was soggy. The carpaccio was very yummy. The burrata salad was nice, but super salty. Entree wise, I had the sole and it was nice with a light sauce and capers. I also sampled the sea bass, which I actually thought tasted a lot better, though. And the steak was sort of this sad hunk of meat on a plate with no sauce to finish it or any garnish. I realize veggies come on the side, but couldn't they make the steak at least look appetizing? \n\nAll in all, the food was nice but it wasn't amazing. And the service was just slow. If I can walk to the bar across the room, order a drink and get it before a waiter decides to even check on us, that's not a good sign. I do recommend the people watching, though."

They told me they were booked for a week in advance and didn't have the ability to take walk-in guests! So after doing some searching we landed on STK at Cosmo... Upon our arrival we were all surprised at how interesting the interior was and it was nice and quiet when we got there....\n\nAfter ordering our drinks the music started blasting and I couldn't hear anyone at my table! I asked the waiter if this was normal and he said yes I didn't like that so I took a star off for it this wouldn't be a place to bring a first date to that's for sure cause if you both don't have laryngitis by the end of the night it'd be a miracle... On to the food...\n\nAppetizers: baked oysters and foie gras French toast ... The baked oysters were their take on oyster Rockefeller and I'll be honest of everything I had there that first bite was the absolute most memorable thing about the visit... It was phenomenal and the presentation was awesome too the French toast was good I liked the pear that came with it however the bread had a flavoring to it I couldn't pin point. it wasn't bad but definitely different ... \n\nMain: We all ordered the filet I had mine med rare and it was cooked perfectly the sauces They have for the steaks all tasted good we tried the wine sauce the bernaise and the chimichurry for sides we ordered the truffle fries the broccolini and the mushroom potpie mushroom potpie tasted excellent but it also tasted good reheated as I just finished it as I write this review :) yum yum ! \n\nThe broccolini came with a hot chili oil on it that you can't see but boy it was fire in your ass hot I'm going to be in pain in a few hours I reckon but it'll be worth it in the end.  The fries were of course amazing \n\nI also ordered two shrimp to go along with my steak. These things were giant shrimp ... I know now what a 6.00 shrimp looks like and I could have just ordered 5 of those and had that as a meal In itself.... They ate like lobster tails and didn't taste too far off from it either we had no room for dessert but the bread pudding with captain crunch sounded awesome! \n\nAs you can see the food here really is spot on you'll definitely pay the tourist tax though but a place like this is something that once in a blue moon the heart calls for ... That is of course it doesn't go into some weird arrhythmic shock and kill you from the thumping of the music in the background."

I booked a reservation about two weeks in advance for a Tuesday night and all they had left was a 6 PM, so I would definitely suggest booking ahead of time (though they do accept walk-ins if you want to take a chance or wait). All of the food was delicious and came out really quick. I ordered the filet as my entr\u00e9e and while it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was very good. As it got later and the restaurant began to fill up, the music got louder, which added to the atmosphere. Our waiter was good but I wish he were a little friendlier.

With all the options in Vegas, I wish we had done something else.\n\nI'm not going to say I have the clearest recollection of the dinner - I mean it was 8 PM in Vegas and I'd had more than a couple beers throughout the afternoon. Ok, I started at breakfast. Still, I remember enough to know that we were seated 30 minutes after our reservation was scheduled and it took over an hour to get our food - long after tables seated after us were scarfing down their entrees. I did complain about the wait and we got a free round of drinks... which is something.\n\nThe food (when it eventually arrived) was pretty good. We each had the filet and it was cooked properly and was very tasty. The potatos were disappointing and reminded me of the instant spuds you pour out of a box.\n\nThe tap beer list is non-existent, but they had a couple decent options in the bottle including Dogfish Head 60 minute (which they ran out of after my first one) and a couple others. Just plan on drinking cocktails and paying a lot for them... like anywhere else in this town.\n\nIf you want a hip, jumping spot for dinner that epitomizes what Vegas is all about these days, look no further. The music is loud, the bar is trendy and it's full of pretty people dressed for the clubs. Just don't expect quick service and give yourself a couple hours to spend here. I don't plan on going there again - too many other great options around there."

Some Frank or Dean playing in the background, leather booths, gin and tonics before the meal, etc.  \n\nTechno music?  Cosmopolitans?  I get it, the Cosmo resort is trying awfully hard for the young hipster vibe, and yes, some of those kids have some serious money to blow.  I guess you need a place like that for \"those people.\"  I had a decent meal, paid way too much for it- mostly due to the wine-, and can cross this place off the list forever as \"not my scene.\"  \n\nYou kids go have your fun, though.

The steak was good, however, and the sides were even better. Not the usual potatoes. \n\nIf you are into formal service \"Good afternoon sir\", white linens, traditional service that comes with steak houses, this is not the best place for you. The waitstaff here are awfully contemporary /modern, not informal or casual like quacky and annoying, just..contemporary and unfussy for what is normally associated with pricey steakhouses. They have a way of putting you at ease.\n\nIf you are into atmosphere - this is the place to go. Its like a club with steak on the side. The music is pretty much like Marquee, Top 40 messed up into electronic, the DJ plays Loud, libations are good all around, and you get pumped up without having to go to a club if thats your thing.\n\nThere are no cheap restaurants in the Cosmopolitan, in my opinion, so you're dropping at least $50 a person before tax any which way. Most people would edge toward $100 per person after all said and done. A small steak and a drink for two people ran $150 after tax and tip at this place. Was it worth it?

Let's face it though, any decent steakhouse located in the Cosmo would be killing it right about now regardless of the restaurant caliber. Granted this place is better than average in food quality, ambiance and eye candy, it does lack in service. Sure your server will possess pulchritude and a coquettish demeanor but she'll forget to bring your app or drink, after the 10 minutes you had to wait to flag her down. \nWhatever though, it's the place to see and be seen in Vegas, if you can get a table for your party, that is. In our predicament, we had to haphazardly stroll in in groups of three or four; and that was only to talk our way into geographically undesirable bar tables (since we couldn't get an after 6 reso for the big group). \n\nThe Lamb Chops I ordered made for a solid entree. Albeit my long-time bias to skirt steak, I don't think the price break (comparatively speaking) was worth going with that carne asada option. Also the complimentary bread here is awesome."

Speaking of the operator, it was kind of cool not having to be transferred to a call center for the reservation process - the operator took care of that. However, what's the point of asking \"are you celebrating anything special?\" if nothing special is done for the birthday boy? I mentioned to have a birthday dessert presented at the end of the meal with the candle, but it never happened. Not even a single \"Happy Birthday\" from the maitre' d or the wait staff. Don't get me wrong, Luis was a great waiter, seems to be very knowledgable with the menu, and was able to assist us with the explaining the menu by asking if we were first-time diners. The busser, on another hand, was not very helpful when my husband complained about the wobbling table; Luis ended up fixing the wobbling table. The food was great, we enjoyed our beef tartare; my husband enjoyed his big eye tuna; I managed to enjoy my ribeye steak too, but it lacked fat content - I've had better cuts of bone-in ribeye. I was gonna order a dessert, but I thought a \"special\" dessert was on its way so I didn't order any. So then ... the check was presented, and a girl who has a sweet tooth left the restaurant without her dessert ='( By the way, the restaurant was a little too loud for my taste, I usually am not against an  energic ambiance, but if I can't hear my husband well, then I have a problem."

Music is blasting like you're in a club - takes away from the food (which, btw, is DELISH (see 3., below)).\n\n2. Service was awesome. \n\n3. FOOD IS DELISH (but see 1., above): \n\na) Bread: soft, moist, and cutely-shaped; \nb) Oysters: yum, can't go wrong; \nc) Filet and Ribeye: YUM, perfectly cooked as requested (medium) (FYI, they bring out an assortment of sauces for your meat -- never used them, but thought it was neat); \nd) Mac and cheese: pasta shape threw me off (very short tube-shape); other than that it was delicious;\ne) Mashed potatoes: creamy yumminess; and\nf) Asparagus: meh, these were so-so and under-seasoned. They throw on a weird butter cream on top that doesn't add anything, except fat to your thighs. \n\n4. Our table was too small for what we ordered, so our waiter used our forks as tongs, grabbed our filet, and placed it on our ribeye plate -- is this normal? (Also see 5., below).\n\n5. Our steak came out cut in strips -- is this normal? (Also see 4., above). Maybe our waiter thought we were sharing (?). \n\n6. People are not dressed for a fancy shpancy steak dinner.

Turn it counter-clockwise)\n\n\nLike many of the reviews on here, I was hoping for awesome and I got moments of cool with whole smattering of  average. I have eaten at 90% of the steakhouses here in town and I have a pretty good feel for what is hip and cool. \n\nAmbiance-\nThe music is WAY to frackin loud. It's bad form to have to yell at my wife who is 3 feet away from me during dinner.  I have 6000 watt home theater with 4 18 inch subs so I'm not in the \"If it's too loud your too old club\".  \n\nBut for an upscale steakhouse in an amazing casino it's just amateurish. I get concepts and this one just sucks. \n\nNor is this the place to bring clients to discuss business. It is however a good place to bring inlaws because you won't be able to hear them.\n\nAnnoyance factor minus 2 stars\n\nFood-\nWe asked for a heavy peppercorn rub on our steaks so much so that the steaks would be \"ruined\" with pepper. They brought our steaks cooked perfectly to temp and with a thick coating of peppercorns.  PERFECT! I had the STK Bold Sauce and my wifey had the creamy horseradish. My sauce was good if not a bit too sweet and the horseradish cream sauce was blah. \n\nWe had the truffle fries (LOVED), Asparagus (good as it can be) and mac and cheese(Eh, cheesier and more crunch please)\n\nIf I had to find fault It would be that food came out a bit too quick. It was about 5 or so minutes after the apps were completed. \n\nOverall N9ne, Botero and Brand have a better product. \n\nMinus .5 stars\n\n\nStaff- \nThe FoH girls were cute, dressed well and very friendly.  No complaints here. \nBar staff was interesting- My bartender told me her signature drink was a cucumber and basil martini. She said was it amazing and I asked, is she so sure that she will buy it if I don't like it? She said no.  Fair enough, except the bartender next to her had a group of folks come in. Couldn't tell if they were friends or business but there were 8 of them in the group and he proceeded to make them all drinks and then tell the group that the whole round was on them.  Hmmm....\nI joked to my girl if I could be part of their group. She didn't get it. Oh and the cucumber martini at union is way better. \n\nOur waiter was awesome as was the buss staff.  He was polite, fun and knowledgeable about the menu.  \n\n\nI probably won't be back as I'd rather go to N9ne or Botero for the same price and not have to deal with the frackin music. Plus N9ne has a cool vibe that is way more  my liking than \"Steak at the Roxbury\" feel of STK."

We had ordered the truffle Parmesan fries as an appetizer, which was really good. Dinner, we had ordered the skirt steak, which was to die for! By far the best steak we have ever had (better than BOA's steakhouse is LA.) While eating, we sparked up a conversation with our waiter and had mentioned to him we were on vacation for our honeymoon, he had told us congratulations; once we finished our meal, we ordered a desert, the ice cream cookie. Once they had brought out our desert we noticed the waiter had wrote on the plate Happy Honeymoon!, which we thought was super sweet of him. We overall had such a great night, I would defiantly go there again next time we're in Vegas. I highly recommend this place, customer service is above normal standards which I love, one of the guys working there would repeatedly come and wipe down our table anytime he saw any crumbs on the table, our drinks were always full, didn't have to ask every time we needed a refill like most places. Our knives and forks were changed between meals, and at the end of our meal we were even greeted by a manager and he introduced himself to us and even asked us about our experience. I absolutely loved everything about this place and if you're in Vegas and craving a juicy steak this is the place to go. The prices were also very reasonable, we ordered an appetizer, dinner for two, and also a desert and our bill was $100! Very reasonable for such a wonder restaurant. Must try!!"

They moved us to another table, but smelling someone's barf was not such a great way to start the evening.  I ordered lobster, two others ordered fish and the entrees were excellent.  My Hamachi appetizer was also excellent and so were the other's salads.  The fourth person in our party ordered a rib eye steak and it was tough and difficult to chew.  To the restaurant's credit, they took the rib eye off the bill with no charge.  The only other negative is that everything is extremely expensive, which is OK, if you don't have to smell barf and get excellent service with excellent food.

The DJ was able to keep the entire restaurant happy with an upbeat vibe. Thought maybe this would turn around our experience. And unfortunately it stopped about there. \n\nWe all ordered steaks and each steak was cooked incorrectly. The medium came out rare and the rare was cooked to a crisp. How do you incorrectly cook steaks at a steak house? Not one, but four slabs of premium meats that you are expected to pay a premium for. This part still baffles me. The variety of sides came out far later than our steaks which was not ideal, but we accepted it. After being the most excited for the lobster Mac and Cheese that was off the menu, it was beyond a disappointment. Lacking all flavor and the sauce was too runny for my liking. We paid the tab and went on our way.\n\nMaybe I feel like there should be a baseline of service and quality when the average ticket is in excess of $100 per person. STK missed the mark by a long shot. Do yourself a favor and check out any of the other restaurants surrounding it or look at other properties for a proper steakhouse."

We both ordered salads that were large and fantastic.  Our entree's were both bone in rib eye steaks cooked perfectly the way we ordered them.  One of the two side dishes was great which was the yukon potatoes that tasted like you were eating warm butter they were so creamy.  The second appetizer was mac and cheese that was baked with a generous amount of cheese on top, except for the fact that they were made with tiny noodles that resembled more like something you would give to a child which I asked if they were meant for a 5 year old.  The combination of tiny pasta and a large amount of cheese made it soupy and not worthy of the $10 they charged for it.  STK, get rid of the mac and cheese or make it so an adult would enjoy it.  The sideshow of the obliterated drunk girl across from us was priceless though, with all of the nose picking and messy mashed potato eating she couldn't make into her mouth with consistency made the night for us though."

The bread & EVOO/Chive dip was awesome. Ordered Wagyu & Filet, asparagus, Shrimp cocktail, risotto,,,,All excellent. So far this place is the best for Wagyu. Minimum order is 4 oz. @ $40 an ounce. Had the restaurant give my son a dessert with candle for his BD. The Manager of the restaurant came and introduced herself and wished him a great BD. The service was impeccable as well as the food. The crowd surrounding us also sang Happy Birthday, which was freakin awesome too. I would definitely come here again for a Fantastic Meal!!"

We had a reservation at 730 and was not seated until 8...that is my biggest pet peeve. Why make a reservation if you show up 5min before and are not seated until well after your reservation time? The music is loud and anything but relaxed...our waiter wasn't that friendly to start and seemed to get annoyed when we asked him to repeat himself because we couldn't hear a thing! I am not a fan of having to get up close and personal with a stranger to order food. We spoke to a manager who was extremely professional and seemed to have a lot of practice with dealing with the noise level complaints...yes I get it that it's vegas and restaurants are loud. Our appetizers seemed to take forever. They were worth the wait though. Seemed to be that this place relies on the food to make up for a unpleasant atmosphere. My steak was perfect and sides were great. I haven't decided if I would return but if you are someone who likes a loud club like scene with food by all means...I think there are better places to eat more my style."

Perhaps \"Sexy Trendy K____\", but I couldn't think of an appropriate K-word.  Oh well.\n\nLinguistics aside, STK is a rad place for dinner.  Located in the P3 restaurant zone of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, STK is nothing like your typical, stuffy, smoke-filled Vegas steakhouse.  At STK, ultramodern decor, Ed Hardy button-down shirts, sky-high hooker heels, free-flowing cocktails, and loud electronic music rule the day.  I would expect no less at the Cosmo.\n\nI had my first STK experience when I met some friends for dinner at the bar on a Friday night.  The place was packed solid, but it was mostly groups waiting for tables in the dining room, leaving the bar empty.  (Side note: The bar is all curvy and gorgeous, but it comes at the expense of leg room.  Tall people beware.)\n\nI ordered a delicious Pinot Grigio (thanks for the heavy pour!) and noshed on the free bread (loved the blue cheese butter and chive olive oil!) while browsing the menu.  There are lots of traditional steakhouse items, but plenty of fish and vegetarian options make STK a good option for any sort of diner.  Our group ordered a bunch of different items, which was ideal for sampling and tasting:\n\n** Foie gras and waffles.  This appetizer was absolutely **amazing**.  Easily the best foie preparation I've ever had (but, admittedly, I haven't tried all that many).  Loved the sear on the foie, and how the sweet huckeberry gastrique cut through the savory foie.  The waffles were crispy and light as air, too.\n\n** Beet salad.  Simple, but outstanding.  The beets were perfectly cooked and had a nice sweetness.  Plenty of goat cheese and pistachio pesto, too.\n\n** 7 oz filet.  Admittedly, I'm not much of a steak guy -- but this filet was out of this world.  Its texture was like butter, and it had amazing flavor.  (More hardcore carnivores may probably opt for a larger cut, but 7 oz was just right for me.)  \n\n** Broccolini.  An ideal side dish, since it was excellently cooked, and provided a nice crunch to contrast with the filet.\n\n** Sweet potato donuts.  You might not think of STK as a dessert destination, but these divine donuts might change your mind.  Sweet potato made for an unusual twist on a conventional donut, and a gooey and decadent pecan glaze brought it all together.  Heaven!\n\nService was outstanding.  Pretty much everyone on the staff looks like a model, with sex appeal dripping out of every pore -- but don't expect \"Vanderpump Rules\"-style drama or catty behavior.  Quite the contrary -- the staff at STK are 100% professional and courteous, and quite friendly.  The pacing of the dishes was nice and steady, and we were never felt rushed or pressured to leave, even as we lingered over glasses of wine for maybe ~30 min after we had paid our tab.\n\nI was definitely impressed by STK.  The whole experience was PRFCT."

This would have been ideal for dessert. The french toast was huge- a meal in itself.\nI then ordered a filet mignon with seared foie gras on top and bernaise sauce on the side and cream spinach as side dish.\nThe steak was heavenly- I had an orgasm at my first bite. - the bernaise sauce was ok. and the cream spinach was very light. Not your typical cream spinach. I think that the stellar dish of the evening was my entree."

I don't know how that meets building codes--but if you go to STK and have to use the restroom, do yourself a favor and leave the restaurant.  There are large public bathrooms just across the hall.  You will save yourself time and frustration...and you'll be waiting forever for your food, so you might as well get in a little exercise."

We had a 6:30pm reservation, so there was no music for the majority of our time eating. The music came on at the end of our meal and was a good playlist, but soon became loud and like a club. It became difficult to talk across the table and impossible to hear the waitress. We were seated in a booth that was so crammed in that we could hear the conversations of the nearby tables. \n\nThe food was very average. We ordered the scallops as an appetizer but found them very bland and chewy. We both ordered filets which were also bland and overcooked. For sides we tried the asparagus and potatoes. Our waitress brought over the wrong type of potatoes and we decided not to complain due to our frustration with the experience thus far. The asparagus was limp and had a tasteless, greasy brown sauce. The wine was great and the service was decent. \n\nOverall, I was very unimpressed and wouldn't go back on my next trip to Vegas."

I generally eat a lot but at steakhouses, I like to try a lot of appetizers and side dishes and usually get really full about halfway through my steak so STK is great in that they have small, medium, and large steaks.  Yeah, the small steaks (i.e. the 7 oz filet that I got) is usually for girls but oh well.\n\nWe had a group of 10 and they were able to accomodate us in one of the private dining rooms.

However, it's a fun place if you're starting off your night and want to get the party started at dinner. Just be prepared to speak loudly to your fellow diners!\n\nAside from the atmosphere, STK is a pretty traditional steakhouse in service, food, and presentation. Our server was pleasant and professional, showing a remarkable grasp of the menu and specials. However, there were a few small glitches in service. The first,  when we received an appetizer we didn't order.\n\nThe food itself was very good, but not perfect. The complimentary bread had good flavor (it was brushed with blue cheese), but not soft enough for my taste. Our appetizers, the burrata and the scallops dish, were delicious though. The tomatoes were fresh and sweet, the cheese a great compliment. The scallops were meaty and tasty. \n\nHowever, I was a bit disappointed with the steaks. I ordered the ribeye, medium rare, and it was definitely medium, if not medium well, throughout most of it, being just a light pink instead of the dark pink to red of medium rare. My dining companion ordered the filet, medium, and his was obviously medium rare to rare, so I think the orders must have gotten mixed up. (Second service glitch)\n\nThe lobster Mac and cheese was yummy, with big chunks of lobster throughout, and the bananas foster cheesecake was a sweet and tasty end to the meal.\n\nOf course, this decadence is not for the light of wallet. I got a glimpse of the bill -around $350 for 2 cocktails, 2 glasses of wine, 2 apps, the 2 steaks, 1 side dish, and 2 desserts.\n\nAll in all, a fun steakhouse, and a good meal, but I think I prefer the traditional approach, especially since perhaps all of the noise affected the service slightly.

It was around $60 something per plate which was a little pricey, but we did order 2 of these.\n\nWe also ordered a tomahawk steak for 4 to share and then some sides to go with our dinner. Everything else was decent. I thought our tomahawk ribeye was a little tough compared to the other steaks that I had before at STK... For $100, I expected it to be better.\n\nWe ordered mushrooms, corn pudding and Mac and cheese for our sides. I wished that the waitress told us our main dish the Chilean Seabass came with mushrooms so we could of picked a different side, but she didn't.\n\nWhen the bill finally came. I noticed that the Chilean Seabass was charged and then there were those 2 shrimps that were charged as add on's. I thought that was very fishy. I think she told us that it was included in the special so she could charge us more and make more tip. She charged us $6 per shrimp as an add on for 2 Chilean Seabass specials. That's an additions $24 that we didn't even want. We didn't touch any of the shrimp because we already ate so many of them on our seafood platter. \n\nWe did end up complaining about that and they did end up taking it off...but next time be careful and watch of for their tricky ways to add on things to you bill! \n\nShe was super slow and we had to flag down people every single time to get even our water or drinks refilled! \n\nFor a $500 dinner for 4 people that didn't drink. It was just an okay experience this time around."

However, as a waiter or server, I think it's important to keep your composure with somewhat of a smile on your face (even if you're dying on the inside).  Unfortunately, our waiter seemed incredibly flustered and utterly miserable from the minute we saw him.  I felt bad for the guy!\n\nService, I can forgive more easily.  Quality steak at a steakhouse, on the other hand, is a different story.  I ordered a small Filet Medallion cooked medium rare.  It came out just seconds away from being medium.  The meat was decent but not as tender as I'd like it.  It was just...okay.  \n\nThe Parmesan Truffle Fries were a lot better.  I should have just ordered this and a salad.  They were crispy and rich in cheesy truffle flavors.  \n\nFor the price tag of the evening,  I'll pass next time."

Variety of sides that did justice too, highly recommend the parmesan truffle fries and mac&cheese. \n\nHave to deduct 1 star for the service. Hostess was vert friendly but the waiter not so much. Our reservation was quite early and the restaurant was fairly empty yet the waiter struggled to put on a smile and with every question/recommendation we asked, it seemed like we were an annoyance. Regardless, the most disappointing part was that I booked this reservation way in advance informing the restaurant that I was celebrating an anniversary. I was expecting some sort of acknowledgement in the form of a dessert (like pictures in other reviews for birthdays, etc.), but nothing! It was evident that the restaurant was not going to do anything and I knew this was the case when we were asked if we had room for dessert.\n\nOverall, I'd come back to STK again, however would be interested in trying other steakhouses and restaurants on the strip. Great food and menu, but service sub par."

The hospitality business would be so much better if it weren't for the guests, right? No effort to accommodate us--we would have gladly waited.\n\nAlso, it's more of a nightclub that serves steak.

The vibe is a lot of fun, eye candy everywhere, some are even interesting which is a bonus, it's dark & sexy, the seating is perfect for groups, the music is great, the food is good but in my opinion needs some work. \n\nThe issues - my steak was pricey and was very salty & had too many grisly parts. My goddess salad lacked in flavor & creativity. I also tasted my friends Caesar and it was pretty boring. As I mentioned I expect more when paying prices like these. \n\nThe good - my friends seared tuna which was perfectly cooked & very flavorful. My friends skirt steak which was more tender then my sirloin and less salty. Our sides were very good, the perfectly cooked asparagus, decadent mac & cheese and the really great jalape\u00f1o cheddar grits that were super rich & creamy with just a hint of kick. Dessert was good but nothing amazing. I definitely didn't have any magical moments and I really wish I had. I also need to give a shout out to the complimentary hot buns that come out of the oven in an iron skillet with a very flavorful dipping sauce. \n\nThe best part was the company with a large fun group and just having a good time together before the weekend begins! This place is great for larger parties and the service was good too."

We ordered several sides that were flavored really well.  The first was the creamy yukon potatoes, this was good, not too dry.  My favorite was the sweet corn pudding.  This was really flavorful and like the name says, sweet.  The mac and cheese was okay, this was nothing original so I would not recommend this really.  The mushroom pot pie was scrumptious, all my friends really liked it.  Enough to order a second one at least. \n-I had the medium filet which I wanted medium cooked and boy was this juicy and appetizing.  There's a reason why this place is known for their steaks!  I don't think any other place can make their steaks better than STK.  \n-At the end of the meal, we each had an expresso shot.  Let me say this, their expresso kept me up all night!  Lol!  This was a great dining experience, so hope you get to enjoy this place!\n\nImprovement:\n-It took a little less than 20 minutes to seat up but preferably, since we made reservations, we wanted to be seated right away.\n\nTips:\n-The bread they give you was delicious and soft, it came in this green dipping sauce that was really good.  Make sure to have a little of that before your big meal!\n-The portions of the steaks were sized depending on what size you order but we shared a medium between two people and we were stuffed."

I ordered the side of wild mushrooms and they were really great!! I also tasted a friend's delicious mac and cheese which was definitely shareable for two bc it was so rich.

The two who did not have steak thought the meal was good, not great. And the remaining 3 who did not get overcooked steak, had a great, great meal.\n\nThe appetizers and salads were nothing to write home about and I would honestly suggest skipping them. They fill you up, cost more than they should (seriously, it shouldn't cost $15+ to simply cut a head of lettuce in half, that's crazy).\n\nI got the skirt steak which was fantastic. It was a LOT of steak, when it comes out and you see those two lengthy strips lying next to each other you think you'll never finish that much steak. But, I have to say, mine was just soooo damn good. Full of flavor, cooked well and after each bite I found myself savoring for the next one. I would definitely go back just for the skirt steak. \nThe sides we got were fine, mac and cheese probably the best of them, but simply what you'd expect.\n\nWe didn't get dessert, opting for some shots instead. The shots were watered down which was honestly totally unnecessary and disappointing.\n\nI rarely do this, but I have to say, the atmosphere at STK is simply incredible. Really sets the mood for the rest of the night. It's on the darker side, not high ceiling, interesting wall/table/seat designs. I'd say it has the best atmosphere of the Vegas steakhouses."

Next we had the foie gras french toast with slices of apples, which too was excellent, all the flavors together made it a memorable experience.  Now for the main course, I had a bone in rib eye with truffle butter and foie gras on top of the steak.  I got it medium, I usually do medium rare, but I decided medium that night.  The quality of the steak wasn't what I expected.  I was definitely expecting more from at top notch steak house.  The steak tasted dry and was overcooked.  Adding the foie gras and truffle butter really enhanced the flavor, but couldn't help a dry piece of meat.  My other buddies got theirs medium rare and they said the steak was a little dry, not as dry as mine, but dry.  Service was ok, took a long time to get the food out, the Maitre de was rude and shouldn't judge people by how they're dressed.

            "review": "Such a nice surprise for my birthday trip to Vegas.  I wanted somewhere fun, good, and not too expensive to have a birthday dinner and this was perfect.\n\nPARKING: It's located in Cosmo, on the 3rd floor.  If you park in self-parking you have to walk kind of far because it's located near the lobby.\n\nATMOSPHERE: The inside is dark and trendy.  With hanging ball lights and cool fixtures.  I made reservations for 6pm because we had to get to the club early and it was slightly crowded, but I'm sure it gets more crowded later on at night.  It was perfect for a fancy birthday dinner.  We got a half booth half table with 3 people sitting on chairs.  For attire I could see you getting away with a nice skirt and top, fancy top and jeans or dress.  You can't be overdressed here.\n\nI heard the music was super loud and fun, which makes the dinner experience better but at 6pm the music was kind of soft and more old school.  I think as the night went on it got louder and they were slowly making their way into the 90s but we didn't stay long enough to experience it.  \n\nFOOD: \n\nSTEAK - Their cheapest steak is like $39 and they have a lot of other options but if you don't like steak I wouldn't come here.  My suggestion is to share the steak with someone else because it is pretty big and expensive.  My boyfriend and I shared the bone in rib steak (basically the rib eye) and it was plenty for both of us.  The steak itself doesn't come with anything so it's recommended you get sides ($12 each!) We got 4 to share among the 8 of us and it was plenty.  Beware though because we got the truffle mac n cheese and that was more than $12.  You can get \"toppings\" on top of your steak but it's not needed.  The steak itself is very flavorful and tasty without anything.\n\nSIDES -\nTruffle mac n cheese - The mac was the round short pastas usually in macaroni salad and I really liked that.  A good crust on the top with a yummy truffle flavor and pretty creamy mac n cheese.\n\nTruffle parmesan fries - They are thickly cut and are more like potato rectangles than fries.  They are stacked like Jenga and have parmesan and truffle oil on them. They were a little too potato-y and thick for my liking but everyone at the table loved them.\n\nMushroom pot pie - A weird side but it was literally a pot pie with mushrooms, onions and a creamy sauce inside.  It tasted like truffle but I don't even know if it had truffle.  The top is a light crust, which wasn't that flaky and pretty thin.\n\nBok Choy - Weird for a steak place but it was kinda spicy.  Very flavorful though with lots of soy sauce and garlic.  Not bad actually for some greens.\n\nOverall very impressed with STK.  I thought it would be more for the atmosphere but the food was really good! They even brought me out this chocolate cake/mousse for my birthday with a candle :)"

I've been here a handful of times and it never fails to exceed my expectations. Almost everything on their menu is delicious. The ambiance is great. Definitely not cheap, but worth every dime. \n\nOnly thing that sucks is parking. As most of us locals know, getting in/out of the Cosmo is a pain in the rear. Other than that, place rocks.\n\nP.S.

Our server was spot on. The food on the other hand was okay. One thing that really annoyed me that if you want your steak to taste super yummy, you can order an extra sauce to be cooked on it for $2 extra. I did not order the extra sauce since I figured this expensive steak must be amazing without extra sauce. The steak was actually just okay. I would compare it to a steak that you would find at a diner. Also, it annoys the crap out of me when I feel I am being nickeled and dimed. $2 for a steak sauce??? Just add $2 to the price of each steak and call it a complimentary sauce. I so wanted a special dinner for my birthday but it didn't happen. At least the company I was with made up for it. Would not recommend this place."

Much of the menu items might sound familiar, but STK interprets these dishes their own way. \n\nA friend and I dined here for an early dinner. We were seated by the hostess at a tiny table, which was closely situated next to other tiny tables. It was impractical and not intimate to say the least, but we dealt with it. \n\nAppetizer - Bread: Compliments of the restaurant, we received pull-apart bread slathered with blue cheese butter, served in a small cast iron plate. \n\nAppetizer - Seared Foie gras: This was like eating breakfast for dinner. The foie gras was accompanied by three miniature pancakes and marmalade. Delightful. \n\nEntree - Seared Big Eye Ahi: This was heavily seasoned with a Japanese spice that proved to be too hot for my gut to handle. Our server gladly had my dish remade without seasoning, and served with the wasabi mashed potatoes and miso sauce on the side. Overall, my meal  was exceptional, and I especially liked the wasabi mash. \n\nDessert - Chocolate Chip Cookie with Ice Cream- This was one hot cookie topped with vanilla ice cream that can be shared by two people. The cookie was baked and presented in another  mini cast iron pan. It was a delicious way to top off dinner.\n\nSTK has become one of my favorite restaurants at The Cosmopolitan. I do recommend coming here to experience dinner. The downside, as I've mentioned, is the seating. Reservations are encouraged."

The food itself was pretty good - was it the best steak (10oz filet) I ever had - no, but definitely decent.  It was a Saturday night, and the DJ had this 80s/90s thing going on, so it was fun reminiscing down memory lane.  A lot of the folks in our general vicinity were singing along and having a good time, including us.  Service was excellent, the waiters are quirky - they try to be your \"pal\" as well as serve you.\n\nAll in all, it was a fun night with decent food.  We were glad when a table near us cleared out so we could actually gain an additional 12\" of space.  Little did I know I was being prepared for my Spirit Air flight back home on Sunday!"

I quite enjoyed my experience there. The best thing I could say, it was an experience I have never had before at a steakhouse.\n\nWhen I think of a steakhouse, usually it involves older white men as servers wearing doctor white coat, dark wood, calf skin or some type of homage to the steer, and the place is usually filled with business people or couples.\n\nThis place had none if those above!! It was like a club! It was very modern. There was a DJ, and people dancing around. It was hard to talk as the music was so loud. When you wait for your table at the bar, people may try to pick you up or some lady's boobs were on your face as you turn some other directions. Well, it is Vegas after all! So the atmosphere would be considered \"fun\" unless you hate clubbing. \n\nI was there with my business associates and one more plus was this meal wouldn't cost me a penny. Before I knew it, wine was flowing, seafood tower and beef tartare were gracing the table. Yum yum yum.. All were delicious!\n\nI ordered a regular filet with foie gras topping. I was pretty happy. The foie put it over the top for sure! I loved it but I had better tasting steak before. I wish I ordered the boned in filet but I was trying to not take advantage of the opportunity. After all, I already topped it with foie gras. It was rather cheap however, $12 for the topping. What a deal.\n\nSome of the guys ordered the boned in filet and porterhouse. They seemed very pleased.\n\nNext to our table, there was a paralyzed guy in an elaborate wheelchair. I guess he was a loaded poker champ that got injured from some accident. Around him, there were at least five scantily clad women dancing around him, worshipping him. They looked hired but whatever, he was having fun and good for him. It was quite a show for us too!\n\nLastly, our cool server bought our table a round of shots of 1942 tequila and he did the shot with us! How cool.. Never in my life.\n\nSo.. See...?! The experience at STK was nothing I have ever had. Not sure if I would go back though, as once is enough."

This is probably my 2nd time going to a steakhouse... but the difference between this one and some other establishments like Morton's is the music and atmosphere. You definitely feel like you're already in a club dancing away, but you're at a restaurant at the same time which is a pretty cool idea (they have DJ's playing live) Love how they gave us their delicious bread that was served in their steal cast irons with a side of their Pesto Basil dip - seriously addicting, I think we had like 3 orders of their bread before our entrees came in hahaha.. can't help it if it's super good!\n\nI shared the Short Ribs with Carrot Butterscotch, Celery, Cipollinis and the side Parmesan Truffle Fries.. the Short Ribs were very tender and flavorful and the fries are not your typical fries you get at some bar. They're cut almost like steak fries but in almost a perfect rectangle.. You can totally taste the truffle oil goodness! Both were served pipping hot (which is a major plus!)\n\nJust keep in mind that since this is a steakhouse, it's going to be pretty expensive, that's why it's good to share some of the dishes so it won't cost you your wallet ;) \n\nServers were pretty attentive, filled up our waters, and anything else we needed.. but what was even better was how our waiter gave us all complimentary Lemon Drop shots as dessert! Super sweet of him! :)"

Also, I'm not a huge dessert person, but the peanut butter pie was very solid and came with a variety of textures and sauces."

I love the look of the place; from the white washed brick to the cool slotted walls. The decor is very hip and trendy. There is even a DJ, but beware it does get quite loud in there. The lighting was also a little weird, my husband basically had a spotlight on his side of the table and anytime something white (a plate or napkin) hit the light it was blinding. \n\nAfter taking in the scenery, we were greeted with melted bleu cheese bread with a chive dipping sauce. Bleu cheese is one of those things that you either love or hate and unfortunately I hate it. I found it an odd choice since it does have such a strong flavor, but I was able to enjoy the middle of the bread and the sauce was very different from anything I had tasted before.\n\nWe started with the foie gras french toast and it was disgusting! It is literally french toast, a roasted apple, and a giant slab of foie gras. I can see how it would work for some people but it just didn't work at all for me. We went out on a limb on this one and we fell out of the tree!\n\nMy husband got the bone in rib-eye and it was heaven. It was the perfect combination of fat and meat. I had the small filet and it was also spectacular. It was tender, even though I like my meat on the well done side. We didn't opt for any toppings but we did try the chimichurri sauce and it really wasn't worth it. The steaks came with a small side of onions and they were an unexpected highlight. I had regular sauteed onions but my husband had spicy onions that were delicious with the steak. They absolutely know how to cook a mouth-watering steak here!\n\nWe also tried 2 sides, but both were disappointing. The mac and cheese would be absolutely stunning if it had any flavor at all. It has a perfect crispy topping and is cheesy but there is really no flavor. Even a little salt would have taken the dish to the next level. \n\nWe also tried the mushroom pot pie. When the server brought it out I was so excited to dive into it, but then the unthinkable happened, he cut the top off and dumped it on a plate! I wanted to scream out, but resisted the urge. The mushroom flavor was so overpowering and I love mushrooms. It really needed more pastry, we only had the thin top and it was buried under all the filling. It was so sad.\n\nOverall, the service was great and the steak was delicious, but what's a steak without sides? There are many other places in Vegas that can cook a great steak and provide me with excellent side options. Sorry STK you and I are just not meant to be."

I don't think there was a single female employee there who didn't have fake tits.  It must be a prerequisite for working there, and overt tatoos are probably a plus for them, neither of which I care for very much.\n\nI had 1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell which turned out to be kushi oysters from BC.  Oysters in May?  Is Alex S losing his frigging mind?!  No.  \n\nOysters actually taste the best in Spring time.  All of the snow melt bring rich minerals from the mountains/forests into the ocean where they get fat and plump before the breeding season in the summer.  Don't eat oysters in months that don't contain \"R\"?? completely bogus, but I'd probably avoid July/August after breeding season, but as many of the oyster farms grow triploid oysters that don't breed, that's becoming irrelevant these days as well.   \n\nI actually liked the fact that they had sauces off to the side so that I could choose what to put on my oysters, as I like them plain or with lemon at most.  They were good oysters.  \n\nI had bone-in rib eye and it was solid.  Very well executed as I expected from a good steak restaurant.  \n\nOverally, I didn't care for fake tits, tatoos and loudish environment, but I believe that their food is solid.  It's even nicer that I didn't have to pay for it, and I don't mind going back there at all.  However, does it stand out among many great steak places in this town??

Couples order room service or go to Scarpettas at Cosmo for the romantic feel. I highly recommend this place for some good eats with a group to set the mood for the night.

Every STK has their own DJ in the mix to set the tone! \n\nI came here with a group of 8 for a friends birthday on a weekday. Ive always seen this place around however never really had the desire to come. Like I noted above its great for groups and definitely not your old fashion kind of steakhouse. I'm not sure what fell through the cracks with my experience but for our $1100 tab I expected a bit more. More customer superior customer service, more flavor even if it meant more $. It could've been the server who wasn't as enthusiastic and accommodating as the $160+ added on gratuity he was granted hence the size of our party. On to the more Yelp appropriate opinions, the food was mediocre. I never pass up Mac n Cheese with lobster from any almost any where but the cheese here was equivalent to box made Kraft Mac & Cheese and well I'm more of a Velveeta type of girl if we're talking box Mac & Cheese. It was gross and of course hardly any chucks of lobster. The steak was made to perfection and I wish I would've tried a couple different sauces or rubs for the lovely charge of $2 but passed it up. The Yukon mashed potatoes were \"basic\". The pot pie mushrooms were delicious. We order 5 appetizers and they all were bland. Steer away from the shrimp ceviche and beef tartare and beef carpaccio but do order the lobster tail and bite size oysters! Overall, it was just average! Maybe for another birthday or event I'll try it out again... Just maybe.\n\nP.S. \nI heard the sweet potato donuts here with Nutella are out of this world.

Our host Rob was the best and somehow managed to get orders, serve drinks, and bring plates without interrupting the party.  We had a limited menu but many options all of which were great.  We were all served entrees at exactly the same time and every steak was perfect but 1.  Rob took it away and was back with a perfectly cooked steak in less than a minute.  The service, food, drinks, and atmosphere were all perfect.  We will be back!"

For entrees, the porterhouse and filet bone-in steaks with Mac and cheese, Brussels sprout and truffle fries for sides. Absolutely flawless!! You can order different sauces and butters to put on the steaks too. JEREMEY, our server, took it above and beyond with shots on the house . 2 rounds !! So friendly and knowledgable of the menu! For dessert we had the sweet potato donuts with pecans. So incredibly good :))) can't wait to come back for more !! Thanks again Jeremy!!! And STK LAS VEGAS team."

We had a couple of drinks there over the weekend, they didn't have cocktail waitresses serve at the lounge area, with $18-22 each specialty cocktails there, I would like to have some service over drinks..... at least the drinks were yummy and strong.\n\nDecor / Ambience: 4\nFood: 5\nService : 3.5\n\nTotal bill for 2 with 2 martinis no desert: $216\n\nA small restaurant, seatings are kind of crowded, especially for 2 people, I saw many people got uncomfortable with their seats.  But at least it was intimate enough. It is also not a bad idea to eat at the lounge area if you don't make reservations.\n\nOur food: \nComplimentary bread with special house dipping sauce: sooo yummy! one of the best I've ever had\n\nDozen fresh oysters : so fresh and yummy with special house sauce and cocktail sauce\n\nDungeness crab salad: not much salad, but the dungeness crab was so delicious\n\n10oz Fillet Mignon: delicious, perfectly cooked to medium rare with red wine sauce\n\nBig eye tuna: soooo delicious! cooked perfectly to medium rare with wasabi mashed potato\n\nMushroom pot pie: yummy! the portion was like an appetizer \n\nFood was so delicious, flavorful enough without saltiness. Lemon drop martini was good, Grey Goose dry martini was strong, you can choose stuffed olives or regular ones. \n\nThe service was just above average for an expensive fine steakhouse, we weren't very impressed. But he did a good job, friendly, fast and somewhat attentive. \n\nLoved the food, not so much for the entire dining experience. But still a sexy restaurant for a sexy dinner date sometime."

            "review": "UPDATED REVIEW: (marked down to 3 stars).\n\nWe had such a great experience here during the grand opening that we decided to go back a week later with a friend visiting from out of town.  The experience was not as great.  Here is the low down:\n\nHOST STAFF:  Clueless.\nWe made reservations a few days in advance and asked to sit with our server from our first visit.  On the night of our dinner we arrived 20 minutes early to see plenty of open tables but the hostess was absolutely clueless on what to do with us.  Uh, seat us maybe?  We gave her a break and decided to sit in the lounge for a drink while she sorted it out but after 30 minutes (10 minutes after our reservation) we never got approached about our table (except for the wrong name - \"Are you Mr. Kluss\"?) and so we had to go back up to the stand to find out what was going on with the delay.  The hostess seemed like she was making an excuse up (similar to lost homework judging from her age) as to why our table still wasn't ready and so we ended up having to talk to another hostess to get it right.  When they finally went to sit us down it wasn't in the servers area we had twice requested (once during our reservation a week before and once when we arrived).  When we let her know of the mistake the hostess seating us (a different one) made some rude remark about how 'messed up' things were here and sat us down in the section we requested.  Not a good tee-off to a $260 dinner for 3.\n\nDINNER: Too slow and with mistakes.\nThe best part of dinner was the demeanor from or original server.  She was a real pro and as cool as we remembered the first time but seemed to be hamstrung by the slow kitchen service and a few lapses in attention to detail from there - missing or slow items she had to notice and then retrieve.  I'm no stranger to fine dining and a slow pace is nice but It took a good 40 minutes just to get our apps - thats too long.  Overall the food was just \"okay\" for as long as we waited and for the price.  I've been much more impressed at half a dozen other steakhouses in town (The Palm @ Caesars, Capital Grill, Ruths Chris's, Del Friscos, Flemings etc).  Really surprised too that the cocktails were made so inconsistently (in taste) because how complicated is a cocktail?  It was so left to right that we had to keep saying something to the point that the server felt bad enough to finally bring us an extra (right) one for free.\n\nSUMMARY:\nLike the other reviewer our trouble started with the front host staff and unfortunately continued with slow service.  As native Las Vegans we like the Cosmo a lot as far as hotels go and may give STK another shot after we've tried the other restaurants at the hotel first.  The layout is great, the decor, the music and the overall vibe are solid too but as far as service goes and food that blows you away goes - maybe they just have opening week issues.\n\nCaveat emptor."

            "review": "After my last visit, the assistant GM kindly reached out and asked me to give STK another try. This past weekend I did just that and WOW am I glad I did! \n\nWe (party of 4) were promptly seated in a spacious booth. We were attended to by a fantastic waitress, Allyson, who made our night even better with incredible service. We started off with the crispy lobster tails, burrata salad and beef carpaccio. The lobster tails came with an excellent chili sauce that really gave off some good heat. The burrata salad was just as delicious as the last time I had it. The carpaccio and pesto noodles were my favorite. So tender and flavorful, the beef practically melted in your mouth. \n\nFor mains, my husband and one of our friends each had the 16oz sirloin while myself and our other friend each had filets-mine the 6oz and hers the 10oz. The gentlemen devoured their sirloins without offering us a taste so I can only assume it was good. My filet was once again, just ok. Great char on the outside and perfect temp on the inside but not as tender as I would have liked or expected. I would skip that next time and try one of the other entrees.  I will say the horseradish sauce and STK bold sauce were both amazing. Not overwhelming on the heat but just enough kick to wake you up. \n\nFor sides we ordered the mushrooms, yukon mashed, truffle fries, and the corn pudding. Overall, the sides were just an afterthought to me. I wasn't blown away by any of them and the mushrooms were incredibly salty this time. The mashed would've benefited from some salt and pepper or garlic. Our friends enjoyed the corn and fries but neither of them were impressed. I would definitely still recommend the jalapeno grits and I wish I had just gotten them instead. \n\nAfter all this food, somehow we managed to order dessert. The table split the freshly baked cookie and sweet potato doughnuts. I didn't even get to take pictures of either of these dishes because my tablemates literally inhaled them both. I was able to steal a few bites of each and I can absolutely attest to them both being incredible. The cookie was so soft and just barely baked so it retained some of that raw cooke dough flavor in the middle. The doughnuts, which are something I never in a million years would have thought that I'd like, were beyond delicious. Moist with a beautiful glaze and accompanied by a silky smooth quenelle of ice cream. The perfect pairing if there ever was one. \n\nWhile there were just a few let downs this time, I'm so glad we gave STK another try. Impeccable service and excellent food really combine to make the full experience here. I would definitely stop by here the next time I'm in town (if only to have more of those doughnuts!)."

            "review": "For me at least, a decent steakhouse and a nice element of the array of restaurants in the Cosmopolitan.\n\nPros:\n-The menu is pretty customizable. This means that if you know what you like and want, you can get it, and if you don't, you'll probably end up picking something that doesn't hit the spot for you. They divide the cuts of meats into small, medium, large, and \"special\" categories, and to those you can add your choice of rubs/special add-ons (I chose to get my skirt steak peppercorn-crusted, for example). Then you can order sauce to go with it as well (horseradish!)\n-Sides were also surprisingly tasty...the green beans were a hit at our table, despite everybody thinking we got them just because we needed vegetables\n-Great service\n\nCons:\n-Will cost you a bit. This is more expensive than the average nice steakhouse in other cities (as you'd expect)\n-They will enforce their dress code to some degree...which is a bit surprising given that you see people in all sorts of attire on the casino floor one floor down. They'll stop you if you're wearing swimwear, and you're walking the line if you're in shorts and flipflops\n-For some reason they turned the music up pretty loudly in the middle of dinnertime, to the point where it felt like a club, given the very dim lighting.\n-The \"special\" dishes sound absolutely amazing, but a couple people at our table got the wagyu (the \"less expensive\" special, which was still ~$100 a plate), and the portion size was almost laughably small (which I guess is what you get for ordering something \"premium\" in Vegas)"

Kind of silly the fuss they made about being so busy they only take reservations, no walk ins...well we walked in 30 mins late for our \"well try to squeeze you in \" reservation and the place was pretty dead. So we obviously got in no problem. Nice vibe, loud club type music, which we enjoyed. Had 2 shots of patron to get our night off to a good start;) $36. Our waiter was crazy funny, and all the staff were really nice and friendly. And everyone looks like a model here, including the bus boys! Dress code is definitely enforced here. It's pretty snazzy. So my husband ordered the seared tuna which the waiter said was very spicy so my husband jumped on it. I ordered the filet and mashed potatoes. They sent us bread and an interesting dipping sauce that reminded me of a wheatgrass shot. No bueno. So our food arrived I was excited, the steak was good. Not amazing which I expected for a 6oz. $40 steak from a place known for steak. My husband, a true spicy freak was sad his food wasn't spicy at all. So he asked the waiter for hot sauce which got us a really dirty look. Apparently we offended him. Mashed potatoes were ok. I ordered another $16 drink and we were ready to go. Got our check, put our cash down with at least $50 due in change and I guess the waiter expected that as his tip? Once again when we asked for our change we got the glare and some sarcastic remark. Needless to say, don't be rude to your customers...he definitely didn't get the $50 tip he was hoping for. Probably will spend our $150 on another place next time."

I feel that other places over do the olive taste in the olive oil dip, but this was amazing and so good. The bread was also so tender and soft yet crunchy and warm on the outside. DEFINITELY enjoy your bread!!!\n-STEAK LOIN STRIP - so tender and juicy and delicious!!! omg this was amazing.\n-MAC N CHEESE - omg i love their mac n cheese. GET IT!!! definitely worth it. \n-PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - these are not like your typical fries. they're short and chunky, but they bring them out and it has just the right amount of parmesan topping (some places over due the parmesan). Its super warm and crunchy on the outside while warm on the inside. \n\nDRINKS (5 out of 5)\n-strawberry cobbler graham crackers drink - if you're a girl, and u dont like the taste of alcohol and like sweet drinks, definitely get this!!! this was one of the better drinks i've drank in my life from a restaurant place. \n-jack and coke - SUPER strong. they definitely give you your jack for your monies.\n-stk orgy shot - $15/shot or something like that, but it was GOOD. esp for a girl who doesn't like the taste of alcohol. if you're here celebrating a special event and you're with a girl who can't take regular shots, definitely order this one!\n\nATMOSPHERE (4 out of 5)\nI liked the atmosphere, but the one draw back was that the music was a lil loud. They were playing up to date music and nice remixes / mashups, which is nice. I'm not complaining about the music selection at all!! But the volume could have been turned down, especially for a Sunday night dinner. \nThe waiters were incredibly social and super chill. They were having the time of their lives while serving us and dancing around and clapping while on the job. \n\nPerfect place to go for a pre-clubbing pre-outing atmosphere. If youre going to Marquee,  or a similar club , this is the perfect place for a pre-game dinner and drinks.  Also recommended if you're looking for a non-buffet, nice sit down restaurant to celebrate a special occasion with good music and good food (as long as you don't mind the volume)"

It is everything you think of when you watch tv shows like \"Sex and the City!\" It is modern, hip, refined, elegant and caters to the uppity 30 to 50 year old crowd. \n\nEveryone from the restaurant staff to customers were dressed to impress. I felt like I was in that movie \"Oceans 11\" with George Clooney..\n\nI came with a party of 5 and we ordered several different steaks and side dishes, as well as wine and dessert.\n\nAppetizers:\n\nThey give you this baked loaf of bread with parmesan and garlic sprinkled over the top. It comes with a dipping sauce of herb infused butter oil. It is really a tasty treat.\n\n\nSalad: They have a great salad that comes with goat cheese, greens and balsamic vinegar drizzled over it. It is kind of a small salad, but it is quite tasty.\n\n\nEntrees:\n\nI ordered the 14 ounce filet steak that is cooked on the bone. My waiter recommended that its better to get the steak that is cooked on the bone, because the meat is more flavorful and juicy. When they serve the meat, it is deboned, and it is was very good. I ordered it medium and it came out and was super tender, but still dense and so it felt like a real steak and not just soft. It was very tasty and you can order a few sides with your meal.\n\nMy colleagues also ordered different steaks and they all enjoyed their various entrees. \n\nWe ordered several different sides and I would rate them as the following:\n\nCreamy Corn:  This was herb infused corn with creamy goodness. It had the texture of mashed potatoes, but it was a very robust corn flavor.\n\nJalapeno Cheese Grits:   Green Jalapeno pureed with melted cheese and infused into the grits. It had a spicy kick and it was pretty good.\n\nMushroom pot pie:    This is a great dish to order on the side. Its basically mushrooms saut\u00e9ed with caramelized onions and cream sauce in a little pot pie. I enjoyed scooping out the mushrooms and drizzling them over my steak. The flavor combination was intense.\n\n\nThe wine list is pretty good and we ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir. I forgot which one, but the waiter said its very popular and you should buy this in a full bottle.\n\n\nDESSERT:   They have a pistachio and strawberry cake that is baked on an almond and marzipan coated crust. It is served with whipped cream and drizzled with strawberry sauce and its AMAZING! It is very light and not too heavy and a great way to end your meal.\n\n\nThis is a pricy restaurant, but its worth visiting when you are in Vegas for a special dinner or night out with friends. One of the better Steakhouses in Las Vegas!"

I must say, I love this atmosphere compared to other fancy steakhouses I've been to because of the loud music and club like atmostphere. Some may not like that because they want to enjoy their dinner in peace, but I think it adds to the fun of being in Las Vegas, especially if you're eating with a big group of friends. They play a lot of 80's/90's music remixed to dance beats. Sometimes the entire restaurant sings along to the songs.\n\nTheir steak ranks as some of the best steaks I've ever had, very tender and full of flavor. I always get my steak with foie gras on top. Their sides are all very good. My favorites are the mushroom pot pie, mac & cheese, cream spinach and creamy yukon potatoes. \n\nIf you're lucky, you'll see celebrities from time to time dining here since a lot of them do come here to eat.

            "review": "From when we arrived we should have just left. The hostess sets that initial mood. We arrived 30 minutes early. We were told we couldn't be seated until everyone was there, it's one of those policy places. Bad. Ok so we have 30 minutes for everyone to get here, which wasn't mentioned when they left a message in my room or when I called them back to confirm that day, so please prepare our table so at our reservation time there's no waiting longer. Right? Wrong! 30 minutes later we were sat. No room at bar to get a drink or sit so it was an agonizing hour since all is ladies were dressed fab wearing 6 inch heels. After all, we are staying at the Cosmo, short walk to the restaurant. Guests of the hotel don't receive special treatment FYI. \n\nI ordered one of the suggested specials,  filet topped with Bernaise, king crab and asparagus. Also featured was a risotto with shaved white truffles and mushrooms, it was yummy but too salty. My steak was so dry and Paine it was over cooked, asked for Med rare, got Done all beige inside, I sent it back. Very nicely I asked but when it came back a pretty big guy with a bad attitude asked me to cut into and show him if it was ok. I guess they get jerks in here so they need a bouncer to intimidate them so you get the same, awkward! I'm with 3 other couple all not on a budget so wasn't trying for 2 extra bites of a dry steak! Came back perfect! Yay! \n\nOk so where's my King Crab legs?? I asked our server when I chose this featured dish are they split so I could just pull them out of the shell, I'm in a Versace dress I don't want to man-handle a crustacean! She smiled and laughed and said of course!! We do all the work. Perfect! Nope. When I reminded her I didn't get my crab legs she said yes you did, they are in the Bernaise! Silly me. Those couple of little specks of unidentified, because they were tasteless, was actually the crab! Huh?! We discussed split shells, perfect chance for her to say theres a teaspoon of chopped crab, probably canned, in your sauce. I usually don't do sauce if I expect a great steak, no need to smother natures perfection right!?! It was the crab legs I was after, oh wait, now I think about it!!!! Omg, they even called it Surf N Turf!!! Damn, if I'd remembered that then I would have asked to speak w management. So that is sooo misleading!!!\n\nThe best thing about dinner was the company of good friends, the funny server assistant, and the 2 bottles of great wine I brought. I won't be returning. STK used be a great dinner but this third visit tells me it's now a typical spot in Vegas that gets popular and goes cheap. Time to turn it over Cosmo, need a new steakhouse!"

            "review": "Went here for dinner on 3/7 Friday as a party for 3.  We called our host that day to help make reservations.  She said that this restaurant was pretty hard to get into, but was able to get us in at 5:30pm.  We arrived and found the restaurant at 25% capacity, but that changed to about 75% by the time we left.  Great experience over all.\nAmbiance:  Great modern steakhouse decor.  Lighting was initially bright when we arrived, but got dimmer as the night wore on.  There was louder music than expected at a steakhouse, but it must be part of the vibe that they are aiming for.  No kids were there (unlike strip house at PH).  We were seated in the center of the restaurant in a serpentine-like booth. Unique set up that could still put you right up against another party.  We were seated next to a party of 2 and we had plenty of room.  \nService:  I thought it was really good.  OUr server came right away and was very friendly and attentive throughout.  Water, bread, food, etc. all came out at a decent pace.  She seemed to have pretty good knowledge about the menu and made decent recommendations.  \nFood:  The menu was decent in offerings, not too big or expansive.  They had a variety of different items.  Bread was good and had a nice tasty blue cheese butter on top.  Also went well with the chive oil.  I ordered a customized \"surf n' turf\" with Alaskan crab and the loin steak (medium rare).  Actually came out different than I envisioned it (I thought it would be crab legs next to my steak) and was lumps of crab on top of the steak.  Either way, it was really good. I was a tad pessimistic about \"Loin steak\" but couldn't imagine finishing a rib eye.  So I was very surprised with the flavor of the loin.  The sides of Lobster mac n' cheese, asparagus, and fries were also decent.  Highlight of the meal was the Kobe Wagyu.  We ordered 5 oz (pretty damn pricey, think it was around $40/oz) and it was awesome.  Like eating butter...Dessert of ice cream was also good.\n\nWe had a great time and the food was good.  They didn't have as many choices of meat quality that they did at CUT.  I would still return if given the opportunity."

All were fantastic! Prices are a bit high but it's Vegas and the food was worth it in my opinion! Service was good as well!  The bread for the table was outstanding it almost looked like monkey bread and tastes like garlic knots! Ps they gave my friend a free birthday dessert since I had mentioned in the open table reservation it was her birthday!"

Maybe I am just getting old, but when I am eating dinner, I would prefer not to have music blaring in my ears, to the point, where we had to try and shout over it to speak.  OK.  Yes, I am getting old!  The food was just OK.  I think they may have been having an off night, because my whole party seemed to have the same opinion of the food, which is very different from the glowing reviews I heard from friends.  Our server was good, not great, but really can't complain too much about him.  I will try it again on another trip to Vegas,m but first impression was not great."

            "review": "So when we first arrived to Vegas my boyfriend kept saying...\nBoyfriend: if I do good on the tables I'm going to take you to STK!\nMe: What's that?\nBoyfriend: A steakhouse. ..get it STK...steak...isn't that cool.\nMe: Yes, that is so clever. Anyways it must be really expensive if you're depending on doing well on the table. \n\nSo all week he's talking about this place and loses a good chunk of money on the table the night we were supposed to go. Well I played my $10 ( im afraid to gamble), and walked away with $50! I said, \"Well it looks like I'm buying myself dinner at STK, you're not going to talk about it all week and not let me go because you're mad at your bad luck.\" Lol\n\nIt was 10:30pm and before going back to our hotel we went to the 3rd floor of Cosmo to check out STK. We heard the great music coming out of STK and they we're playing all the hip hop jams. It was the best music I heard all week ( esp since it was EDC WEEK). The hostess said they could reserve a table for 11:00pm, so we hung around since the music was good.\n\nAtmosphere- Def looks like where all the trendy people go, Cosmo feels like that anyways. All the women were beautiful, the men dressed nice. There were a lot people hanging around the bar. Restaurant dark and music loud. \n\nSo around 11:10 we were seated and our server was pretty cool. We looked at the menu and I studied what I could get with my $50 winnings. I only went here to spend my winnings as planned.  Well after looking at the menu I saw I could get salad, dessert and maybe water for $50 lol. Most steak dishes were around $50 minimum, chicken dish around $30, all desserts $12, sides $11, side salad $13, and most appetizers and small plates close to $20. Cocktail/Drinks $15 to $30.\n\nAfter some quick calculations I ordered a field green salad, an appetizer, and the sweet potato donuts. I saw that shrimp was $6 so I said,\"Can I add shrimp to my salad?\" The server then asked, how many pieces? I said,\"How many come in the $6 order?\" He said...one piece. I was like, 1 piece? What kind of prep goes into that shrimp, $36 for 6 pieces? Ok nevermind adding shrimp. The server then kept asking if I wanted a cocktail, and in my head I was like ,\"hell no\", keep the free water coming lol.\n\nThe blue cheese bread with chives was a little too strong for me, I'm not a fan of it.  My salad was ok, better than a lot of places but it needed craisins or nuts or shrimp lol...something.  My beef appetizer dish with pesto pasta was light and tasty.  The beef was sliced so thin it melted in my mouth. The sweet potato donuts were sooooo good. Definitely try those.  Sweet and fried fresh. \n\nMy poor boyfriend still had the poop face about losing $400 in 10 min, and he didn't want to try anything. He was at least trying to get into the music to feel better. A girl next to me was there for her birthday and her boyfriend ordered her every dessert on the menu. They all looked so good! Especially the skillet cookie. She actually offered me some, but I heard my boyfriend jokingly whisper...\"if you say yes and take some of her food, im gonna slap you.\" So I told her,  no thank you.\n\nMy bill came to $49 without an entree, but I was still satisfied.  I'll def come back for the full experience when we have more time and money ;)."

The sides were excellent, especially the Brussel sprouts which were baked with tiny cubes of smoked bacon... wow. Service was good and not pushy, and there were plenty of beautiful people to look at all night. The half moon booth seating creates more of a clubish feel, but may leave some diners uncomfortable if sitting in the middle or on the straight edge. But the booths are large so there's plenty of elbow room. I've enjoyed other steakhouses more but I give this one 5-stars because the setting and atmosphere makes for a distinct steakhouse experience."

When I'm at dinner, I like to be able to hear the people I'm sitting with.  It's ridiculous, even shouting my mother and I couldn't hear each other.  STK is a place \"to be seen,\" however it wouldn't hurt them to lean more towards restaurant and focus less on trendy.  STK, are you for pregame drinking or are you for fine dining?\n\nLuckily, I suppose, we just stopped in for a snack at the lounge area.  It's situated so you sort of have to be on the couch next to strangers-- but that's okay.  When the cocktail came around, we ordered the hamachi sashimi and beef tartare.  The food took a little while to come out, but it was busy so thats okay too.  \n\nThe music I can live with but the service was really why STK is 2 star to me.  The hamachi was good, nothing to rave about but still good.  Instead of receiving beef tartare we were given beef carpaccio so I let the waitress know, and she rudely said \"Well you said carpaccio not tartare but did you want me to take it back?'  YIKES it's not my fault you can't hear me, the music is really loud!  She took it back and we were promptly delivered tuna tartare.  Closer, but still wrong- we let her know and she kind of just walked away.  When she came back (we hadn't touched it) she asked us if we wanted to keep it... confused if she meant keep that instead or keep that also, we just said no just the beef tartare please.  Finally the beef tartare came out from an apologetic busser and it was like the hamachi, good but not the best.  Everyone in the lounge seats next to us had that supposedly amazing bread that everyone keeps yelping about.  Is it complementary?  We never received any... was it because she found us to be difficult?  I also ordered a beet salad to go.  When it says that it comes with arugula, it means a few sprigs.  I would call it more of a side order roasted beets.\n\nI would try STK again because I feel like I need to try some steak and that amazing \"complementary\" bread, but are they open for lunch?  Because I could live without the DJ and that girls attitude."

We got to our table right away and were greeted by our waiter, Teddy.  Teddy KILLED the presentation and specials for the evening.  I think that our entire group was sold from the minute that we sat down. the place was hoppin.  The environment was like a party without any sort of craziness.  \nAs for the food, I had the wedge salad.  It had huge chunks of bleu cheese and bacon along with these funky pickled tomatoes.  It was really good.   I then went with the 16oz sirloin with shitake mushrooms on top.  I love red meat and this thing was massive!!  I felt like John Candy in \"Great Outdoors\" eating the Ole '96er.  Although I didnt finish the steak, i enjoyed every single bite.\nAs for the sides...we went with the truffle fries, mac/cheese, yukon potatoes and the sweet corn pudding.  I would have licked the bowl of the pudding, if allowed. Man, it was good.\nAfter dinner, everyone was stuffed until Teddy introduced dessert.  Ok, get this...Sweet Potato doughnuts with maple glaze and crumbled walnuts.  I'm a foodie, and these were the most ridiculously good doughnuts we all ever had.  \nOur bill for 8 with wine and cocktails AND gratuity came out to about $100 a person.  To me, that's a splurge but my wife and I would spend it again in a minute.  \nThere are a lot of fine restaurants in Vegas.

The cocktails... The steaks... The sides... The dessert.... All of it was well worth every penny. The Parmesan fries and corn pudding were highlights as was the peppercorn crusting on the meats. I had the filet which was cooked perfectly. Plus they do bone-in as an option. \n\nNow STK isn't cheap. In fact it's a tad overpriced relative to portion size. Plus the appetizers were not as exceptional as the rest of the meal. But... I can say this place is definitely one of the top steakhouses I've eaten in."

It's a phenomenal dining experience with the finest quality foods molded into divine creations with superb drinks and wonderful service. Props to Ashley!  I exclude the attitude of the hostess as her stilettos clearly were shoved too tightly up into her backside. \n\nThe beef is incredibly tender and succulent, the crab and lobster meat are fresh and delicious, the heartiness of the short rib appetizer is overwhelming balanced well with a slightly sweet butternut squash risotto.  You can tailor your meat to perfect your taste including toppings like crab, lobster, foie gras, etc but I loved the jalape\u00f1o onion. Sauces are only $2 but you don't need them, the meat is juicy and delicious on its own. Definitely get the corn pudding as a side. \n\nThe ladies enjoyed many fine cocktails and my friend (total wine snob) and I had four different glasses of wine to complement our meals and tasted about 10 in between. \n\nWe dined early at 6 on a Friday because we had show reservations at 930 and we left just around 845. I definitely recommend eating earlier because its less crowded and then as you're dining and drinking it gets packed with fantastic trendy music. It's on the louder side but definitely not too loud. We had a total blast. \n\nOverall, yea I dropped a $G at this place but the supreme dining experience that my guests and I totally loved made it totally worth it. \n\nYea. Amazeballs!"

I went there on Tuesday evening, a regular busy night for this upscale classy restaurant. I didn't have a dinner reservation, but I don't think that should be an excuse for my unpleasant experience. I took important clients there to enjoy the fine dining they have to offer.  Usually I receive a well mannered and qualified service to match the high priced dining.  Instead we were rushed to finish our meals and the meal quality wasn't the same as with my past experiences.  All my courses came out too quick.  The service was very fast paced, which is not the norm for $125 dollar per person.  Fine dining at that price usually allows you to enjoy your meal with adequate time and patient professional waiters to attend you. Instead I received fast food delivery and fast food waiters at my service. It was extremely unpleasant, unenjoyable, and unacceptable for \"fine dining\"."

For appetizers we ordered the beef carpaccio, and the burrata salad they were both to die for. I ordered the filet medallion with foie gras on top DELICIOUS!!! For sides green beens are a must along with the potatoes and mac cheese.

Hip hop music was blasting; the walls were padded and sound proof; and there was a flat screen in there. Really interesting ambiance!\n\nAnyways, our waiter was super funny and good-looking.

I'm not sure u can drink on the job nor why he paid for them but, we'll take it.\n\nTheir bread was delicious!!!!! The bread's dipping sauce was amazing...looked like pesto and olive oil...\nTheir wine list was second to none. They had my favorite tequila! And their oysters were pretty fresh.\nI had lamb. DUH! And it was \"eh..\" I mean, maybe I should've had s-t-e-a-k at a steak house but, alas, I've had better. And ordered their \"famous\" mac and cheese as my side....and I was really disappointed =( It was salty. Sadly, I tried friends' mac and cheese and theirs were really good.

Our reservations were @ 10pm, we came a bit early since we were staying @ the cosmo but they didn't take us back until about 10:20pm. It was fine, some girls were restless (us small girls get hungry!) We had a nice big booth in the back that fit the 12 of us. The booth beside us had 6 guys, who nicely sent over $500 of booze to our table (whomever ya'll are we greatly appreciated that!). The food and portions were lovely and everything tasted great! Our server was very nice and kindly took his time with our orders and serving our table. We all loved the music! So many great old school classics! Definitely can't wait to take my fiance here, he would love it!\nGreat restaurant, small or big groups welcome!"

The sweet potato doughnuts and sticky toffee pudding were the highlights for me. I was dreading the DJ music but it surprisingly made for a very nice evening. They played a lot of older music and maybe we sat far enough away that it wasn't too loud. Excellent service.\n\nI don't really know Vegas, but I imagine this is \"Very Vegas\"."

I informed her we were having drinks at the bar downstairs (Chandelier) and if they were running behind, we can stay there until the table was ready. She assured me the table would be ready at 10:30 but the entire party would have to be there. At 10:30 I checked with her again and she said it would be an additional 25 minute wait. We were not seated until well after 11pm. Standing in heels for over 45 minutes will put any girl in a bad mood! Our server was good, the food good, the bar scene vibrant. However, with so many options, I would make reservations elsewhere next time."

The morning of our reservation an employee at our hotel said that STK was so much fun. We decided to go with STK because we figured while in Vegas, go with fun. Lesson learned. \n\nSTK is chic, sleek, and sexy. The bartenders are hot and the music was pumping. \n\nThat's all I can say positive about the place. The food was average. The steaks were average. The creamed spinach was cold. The bread was \"enh.\" Nothing wowed us at a cost of $300. \n\nIf you want sexy, hip, and a place where all the beautiful people eat, go here. If you want someplace with more substance, go someplace else. I know I will."

I hadn't even had the chance to touch the menu to open and browse it. She comes back and takes our drink order and asked if we're ready to order. Come on!! I've only been here 5 minutes! Just let me look at the menu for a little bit... If I wanted fast food, I would've gotten fast food.  She returns with our cocktails, my husband orders an Old Fashioned and I get the Black Rye Affair (both really good and strong) and asks if we would like a bottle of wine. I'm like WTF at this moment, but I stay calm and collected. I answer, No thank you. While she is still at the table, I asked her how the Foie Gras was here at STK. She asks if I've ever had Foie... Well, Hun, I asked how it was here at this restaurant, NOT what foie was or was like. \n\n\nWe order... \n\nWe started with a salad \"Romaine\", I think it's their version of a Caesar. It was pretty good. I liked the Parmesan lemon dressing.\n\nShared the Bone-in Ribeye (med rare), Parmesan Truffle Fries, Asparagus, Cauliflower Gratin. We order the Foie Gras to be topped on the steak, but it did not come out with it. I had to ask the food runner for it. He apologized and said it wasn't on the ticker but will have it right out. She forgot to put it in.. :-/\n The ribeye was grilled perfectly to temp, the Foie Gras was a little \"veiny\" I could not cut/break apart. Everything lacked seasoning.. I was disappointed! We didn't not finish anything, but our salad and drinks.  The gentleman cleared off our table and looked at me kind of weird.. Probably because of all of the food that was still left. There was no salt or pepper at the table for me to season my food. So, I just didn't want anymore. I don't care how much it costs, if I am not enjoying it, I'm not going to finish it. \n\n15 minutes passes after getting our table cleared, we are still waiting on our server. We were ready for the check and she has not come by. My husband had to stop another server to go find ours. She comes by about 10 minutes after asking the other lady to find her for us. We ask her for the check right away when she gets back to us. She offers dessert and coffee to us right after us asking for the bill... We  were mentally out of this restaurant 30 minutes ago! No thank you on dessert and coffee! \n\nWe were excited about trying STK based on the reviews, but instead ended up feeling this place was entirely over rated. At least the food and service was.  I would come here for the atmosphere and drinks at the bar only. Not what I expected for $200 and \"nicer\" restaurant,"

The medium rare filet was nice and bloody, but not overly rare in the middle of the cut.  It was really THAT good.

We had a 6:15pm reservation on Saturday, February 12 (the weekend before Valentine's Day).  We walked right in and the place was busy but not packed.  The music was low, the service was friendly and our waiter Ryan Schuler was a handsome information center. As the next hour passed the room became much busier and the music volume became club loud.  I would not have minded until I heard Whitney Houston's \"How would I know\".  I might be getting older but not that old.  We dressed up a bit and felt comfortable, but we noticed a few older couples from Iowa in their sweatshirts and jeans (they stood out in not a good way).\n\nWe ordered the $40 seafood platter that had 2 oysters, 2 prawns, 2 tuna & I think yellowtail. DELICIOUS! I enjoyed a White Orchid & a Cherry Cobler drink & my honey had the Cucumber drink (reminded me of being at a spa).\n\nWe ordered the 2lb lobster ($75 MP) & I had the Filet Medallion 7oz that was wonderful at $29 & my fiance had the 10oz Filet at $44.  Each was as good as the Steakhouse at Circus Circus or SW at Wynn. We didn't even use our sauces.  A side of the maple carrots and the Yukon creamy potatoes finished the meal off for us.  We were stuffed but left happy."

The DJ was AWESOME and the music, although loud enough to grab my attention, was not too loud to make conversation (even across an 8-person table) difficult. I thought it added greatly to the ambience, and when you have people at 5 nearby tables break into song and talking across the booths to one another, I think that spells success. \n\nMy steak (the small filet medallion) was cooked perfectly and the sauce was great. I also tried the lamb and the skirtsteak with chimichurri and would recommend both. The sides were ok. I was a little disappointed with the asparagus and the mac-n-cheese. The corn pudding was delightful, however, as was our dessert - the bread pudding. YUM. Captain Crunch and Caramel sauce. Who knew? \n\nThe service was great, everyone was very friendly, accomodating, and happy - one server even broke into an impromptu dance when Michael Jackson's \"Billy Jean\" came on. \n\nMy one complaint would be the bathroom - there is only one stall and a long line. \n\nSide Note: If you've got time to kill before or after dinner, The Chandelier Bar or Bond Bar in the Cosmopolitan both offer great drinks, beautiful decor, and fun people watching."

The fois gras was virtually raw.  The best thing was the pear and endive salad.  Very upset that the server said the salad portions were single serving.

The beef tartare was actually pretty flavorful (which isn't always the case), their verson of tomato/mozzarella was luscious, their crab ravioli appetizer had a thick, yummy sauce.  Their bread was definitely one of the most inventive I've seen where it was warm out of the oven, you tore it off and had a sort of blue cheese pesto sauce for dipping.  The filet was cooked beautifully and we all agreed we loved it.  The sea bass special was cooked well, but it needed more of a sauce and more salt.  The truffle mac and cheese was slamming and the bok choy was surpisingly spicy.  The bread pudding dessert was also received well.  I would come back here anytime since it isn't just a steakhouse.  It has enough other types of food if you don't want to just eat a steak so it will satisfy a foodie and it has a fun atmosphere that got our night off correctly.

            "review": "I'm going to bottom line this and then do the review. Will I go back? No. But that's mostly because this place isn't for me. This is a place for someone looking to drop some serious coin on a very good (maybe even great) dinner before heading out to the club. Being as I haven't been to a club in this millennium, and driving house music isn't my bag, I won't be back. That's not to say that this is a bad restaurant - it's just not for me.\n\nNow, as for the review.\n\nWell - the only way for me to review this place is to tell a quick story. My wife and I stopped by looking for a nice dinner before heading out for a show. We were suited/dressed up, and quickly realized we were well overdressed, despite what the prices on the menu would seem to hint in regards to dress.\n\nWe were seated at a booth/table combo with the booth facing out to the restaurant and the chair facing the wall. I, being the gentlemen (on occasion, really), let my wife have the view of the restaurant while I chose the view of her. And that was the defining decision of the night.\n\nUnbeknownst to us at the time we were seated next to the rejected cast of the Jersey Shore. Or at the very least the mother/daughter combo. Thick Jersey accent, drunk, and full of drama. The daughter went on for a good 15 minutes about how awesome it was that I let my wife have the view of the restaurant and what a gentleman I was. The mother didn't say much - I'm assuming she was simply too drunk to communicate. The daughter was interrupted by the brother coming in (for apparently the third time) to start an argument with the mother/daughter about the fact that they needed to leave and he was tired of waiting. He came back once more during dinner to do the same. And having to watch them eat (they were seated right next to us, so you couldn't avoid it) was both comical and disgusting at the same time.\n\nFortunately they left before our appetizers arrived. The waitstaff, who really should have thrown them out, made it up to my wife and I with champagne. Fortunately, I'm a man that can be plied with free alcohol. The little adventure gave us a great rapport with the waitstaff. They took great care of us for the remainder of the night.\n\nAs for the food, we started with the foie gras French toast and the shrimp \"rice krispy treat\", which was really a bisque with toasted rice. The bisque was fantastic with just a bit of a spice to it. The foie gras French toast was very good, but the bread was a bit thick, which overpowered the foie gras.\n\nFor dinner my wife went for the filet (peppercorn crusted), and I did the ribeye with the same preparation. We both went rare. The filet was perfectly done. The ribeye, well, it was bordering on medium. When the server came back over to ask how everything was, the fact that I didn't immediately say \"it's great!\" let her know something was wrong. She immediately scooped up the plate, apologized, and had the kitchen fire a new one. The second one came out cooked perfectly. In fact, when they came out with the second steak they brought out a new thing of potatoes, which was our side. I give them full props for fixing the mistake instantly.\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, I don't think I'll go back. That has more to do with the music/atmosphere than with the Jersey Shore rejects. If you're looking for a club dinner before a club outing, stop by. If you're looking for a reserved steak dinner, this is absolutely *not* the place to go."

I visited STK for me and my girlfriend's 3 year anniversary and I must say I was automatically pulled into this friendly and highly comfortable environment. The music was amazing I really like how STK switches there style of music as suppose many steakhouses that normally keep it down to one genre of music. The restaurant manager came up to us and because of him I'm going to try STK New York once we get back home. Thanks STK Las Vegas I'll see you soon."

            "review": "I've been to this STK at least 4 times and they always deliver a great experience!  Compared to the one in Los Angeles, the Vegas STK seems to win in every category.  For starters, the d\u00e9cor is very sleek and modern but still intimate and perfect for any occasion.  We started at the bar and ordered a cocktail before getting seated.  There were 8 of us so there wasn't much room considering this is more of a sit down restaurant versus a bar to hang at.  Shortly after our drinks arrived we were sat in the upper booths but still had a perfect view of the whole restaurant.  As usually the wait staff is immediately on top of things and comes by to introduce themselves and talk about the specials.  We ordered another round of drinks as well as a few bottles of wine to go with our much anticipated steaks!  This is a very high end restaurant so you need to expect to spend some cash; however I wasn't thoroughly impressed with what they delivered for wines in the $100-$200 price range.  It's more our fault since we were looking to save a few bucks since we just spent nearly $10K in bottle service over the last couple days.  Anyway, for a starter we all ordered the tuna tartar and I must say it's probably the best out there.  That is a seriously bold statement coming from a guy who lives in LA and has sushi joints at nearly every corner.  But seriously this is beyond delicious!   The tuna was very fresh and of the highest quality.  It wasn't a huge portion but they served it on some sort of a candied wonton cripes and dressed it with oil and an avocado sauce.  The mixture of the avocado and sweetness of the wonton was unbelievable when eaten with the tuna.  Also, by adding the sugar to the wonton it kept the shell together so it didn't fall apart like most in tartar dishes.  Next came the steaks and the sides and as always the meat was of the highest quality.  Although everything was amazingly delicious, I did learn one valuable lesson about steaks.  Since we were on our way to another club I didn't want to over stuff myself so I ordered the petite filet; a couple of the other guys ordered the medium size or larger.  We ordered them medium rare but I noticed mine was cooked more through than the others.  The lesson is, always go with the larger even if you don't plan on eating it so the center can stay cooler while charring the outside.  Anyway, it was still very good but just a small thing to point out.  A few of the other guys went with the porter house and it was just perfect.  For sides we had the mash potatoes, mac and cheese, cream spinach and some garlic potato wedges.  For me the mac and cheese was just beyond amazing!  Crispy on the outer edge and creamy on the inside.  The spinach and the potatoes were a little under salted for me but I think they do it so you catch more of the steaks flavor versus having too rich of a side.  To finish things off we all ordered a double espresso, a lemon cello and a couple chocolate peanut butter bars.    The whole experience was extremely top notch from start to finish and that is why I go to STK every time I'm in Vegas."

They drench their sides with butter, which is an all too common sin in chophouses.  But this is more than made up for in their perfectly grilled steak.  I cna only imagine the huge industrial size furnace grill they have in back to serve this many steaks at this rate and at this quality.  The chefs are superb.\n\nThat being said, this is a consistently happenin' place, with a lively crowd to go with the DJ spinning tunes and the casino two escalators away.

From everything that I've read and heard, the loud head-pounding music can be a turn off for those who yearn for a romantic candle-lit dinner, where you can actually hear each other conversate and not just pretend to be. So my tip for you would be book your reservation at a really early time, our was for 5:30pm. \n\nI requested a booth so that we could have more seating and arm room. My request was readily accounted for. Our server was really sweet and genuine. I had to wait for a cocktail for over 30min even though the place was not quite packed yet, but I guess they had to go fetch a watermelon, so she told me the cocktail would be on the house. I appreciated the nice gesture, and that my cocktail was being freshly made. \n\nWe started off with the beef carpaccio w/ pesto angel hair, fried lobster tail and crab salad w/ honeydew and grapefruit. Everything was delish, and balanced each other very nicely. \n\nThe hubby chose the porterhouse and I ended up w/ the bone-in-filet topped w/ Foie gras. Sides were truffle Parmesan fries, brocollini and corn pudding. Our steaks were cooked to perfection, but the Stk sauce that we chose didn't complement it very well. I wished our steak was seasoned just a bit more, so that no sauce was needed. After our request for A1 came, it made everything so much better!! The corn pudding had too much fillers and not enough corn so I would skip out on that next time. I loved my thick cut truffle fries, but it was way too pungent tasting for the hubs. \n\nAs for dessert, we just had to get the sweet potato donuts! We were so full, but luckily the donuts were light and airy. We had an enjoyable evening, but I'm not sure if we would be back w/ all the many Vegas options there is that we have yet to try."

When we sat down, I could feel the very vibe and trendy atmosphere and listen to the very cool music in the background.\n\nFor starters, we had their warm bread with cilantro dipping sauce and their shrimp rice krispies bisque.  Their bread was super yummy........and the shrimp bisque was awesome......a thick creamy bisque with a spicy kick.  Just as good as the Palm's or Craftsteak's lobster bisque\n\nFor dinner, we had their bone-in rib eye steaks and sides of creamed spinach, corn pudding, mushroom pot pie and truffled fries.  The steaks were perfectly cooked and prepared.  The sides were all excellent, especially the corn pudding.\n\nFor desert, we had the coconut up-sidedown pineapple cake......totally awesome wiith a wonderful coocnut/pineapple blended taste.\n\nOverall....I loved STK.  I normally do not enjoy these  trendy steakhouses that are full of fluff and short on substance.\n\nSTK is a trendy, hot steakhouse that cooks steaks like the old boys do!"

This is definitely our kind of place. The decor is modern and hip with soft purple lights and booth seating, which I love since I prefer sitting next to my man. Although the music is loud, we still had an intimate evening. You get the vibe that you're at a cool, upscale lounge as opposed to a formal steakhouse.\n\nFor starters, we shared the burrata salad, a mix of cheese, heirloom tomatoes, balsamic, and basil. Not only was it beautifully plated, but it was equally tasty. A perfect start to our meal.\n\nWe both decided on their special for the evening: An 8 oz grass fed filet. I ordered mine cooked medium, which was a little too rare for my liking. Next time I would opt for medium-well, but the steak was still delicious! To accompany our steak, we chose the creamy Yukon potatoes, wild mushrooms, and asparagus. The potatoes are a must get! I really enjoyed the mushrooms, too. You can pass on the asparagus, though. It was nothing special, and had a rather strange, sour taste to them.\n\nI guess hubby pulled some strings because they brought out a dessert just for my birthday! It was a plate that had \"Happy Birthday\" written on it in chocolate syrup with a cup of assorted mousse and a strawberry macaron. It was so good! Surprise your friend or date by calling the restaurant ahead of time to let them know you're celebrating a birthday. I'm sure they'll love it as much as I did. :)"

I have heard such wonderful things about STK and I figured I'd give it a try to see what's all the talk was about. Long story short I had a cousin visiting me from Wisconsin and he was here to celebrate his 21st birthday! While booking my reservation I made sure it was known that the reason for dining that night was to celebrate. Now normally at these types of places, they give you some sort of small cake and ice cream etc and wish the person a happy birthday. Upon arriving I even reminded the hostess about the birthday, she replied \"yeah ok\" with a smug face. That's the first point off. What's with the attitude? Next when it was time to order food we had a waiter come over who from the get go was STANK. For a person who's never ate at this place I expected some sort of recommendations or just to at least be more friendly. He was unbelievable! One person in my party never really ate steak and he wanted to just get a small appetizer and a side of crab. Well guess what when this crab came out it was on a little petri dish with maybe an OUNCE of crab?  $25??? GTFOH! So when i told the waiter about the size and let him know that it wasnt exactly what I expected he got an attitude and snatched the plate, and at that moment I had to stop myself from snatching HIM! unbelievable! After that situation occured he never returned to the table which was fine because it would have been a situation if he came back with that attitude! Now on to the food.. The food was a different story! I ordered the Bone-In Ribeye steak(medium well) AMAZING! My Cousin ordered the Skirt Steak(Well Done) AMAZING! Another person ordered the Filet(medium). So as you can see the food wasn't the issue it was the service and in a place like this that wants to charge the prices they do, they need to make sure they have respectable people working for them and learn how to not judge people. Nobody in my group was not dressed for the occasion but because you see a group of black guys you off the bat treat us like we aren't suppose to be there? I make PLENTY (legit) MONEY $$$ and eat 5-star meals on the regualr, so fine dining is NEVER an issue. My RED BOTTOM Christian Louboutin loafers cost more than the hostess and waiter's paycheck COMBINED! So.. With all that being said I would NEVER return back to this place even if somebody paid me.. Know That!"

We made a reservation for dinner and was seated near their bar area, which made for interesting people watching. Our waitress was upbeat and friendly. Everything was going well... until the food came.\n\nThe steaks that were supposed to be spectacular were dry, chewy, and lacking in flavor. Even without shelling an additional $2 for sauces, steaks should stand on their own merit.\n\nI had the seared tuna. The tuna itself was fresh, but the sauce used was way too heavy and overwhelming for such a delicate, 'lean' fish (as opposed to another type of fish, such as salmon). Did not hold together as a coherent entr\u00e9e at all.\n\nThe mushroom pot pie was the star of the show, and the fries were thick cut, and while crispy, was inundated in truffle oil flavor. I am starting to agree with Gordon Ramsey who says that truffle oil is the one ingredient that is reserved for amateurs. Way too much reliance on truffle oil to make the side 'great.'\n\nWith the price we paid for this meal we could've gotten an amazing steak dinner off the strip. Perhaps it was my mistake to expect good food from STK.\n\n3-stars still, because I liked the ambiance and the service. 2 stars off for mediocre and disappointing food at a price point and location that should have guaranteed quality."

Not sure if I would go back. I did enjoy the music and people watching. I don't like being asked to move before I'm ready. We were on a comp which normally gets better service too. So not sure if it would have been different otherwise."

            "review": "The food is great and can actually make you full for the price. We went around 9:00PM and its like a chill/hip hop playing music type of place. If you like some quiet type of restaurant well this is not for you. \n \nI just wish we weren't sitting next to some \"couple\" that looks like they just met  because they were making out the whole time. Like why not go to some other places like a hotel instead of a restaurant lol\n\nAnyways....\n\nOut of all the things we ordered I loved the foi gras, wild mushrooms and the steak the most!!! The fries is also great!!! The foie gras is cooked to perfection and so is the steak!! The beed carpaccio is usually my favorite but not from this place. \n\nThe customer service was also great!!! I wish I remember the lady's name but she was really nice and helpful."

Edit: To add to the pleasure of our dinner, a stripper just came to our table to hand out cards. Good steaks, but a generally poor experience."

            "review": "I came on a Saturday night with a party of 5.  We had 7pm reservations and they sat us exactly on time!  The restaurant has a very cool dark sexy vibe.  It is very noisy.. super load music.  \n\nBread with blue cheese butter and chive oil - 4.5 stars - really enjoyed this dish.  Large load of bread crisp on the outside but very soft in the inside.  Just a hint if blue cheese flavor in the butter.  Delish!\n\nCucumber Stiletto - 4 stars - very good fresh light drink!\nButternut squash risotto - 4 stars - this dish had a lot of complex flavors. Short rib and risotto was cooked nicely.  The flavors in the sauce on short ribs prevailed over the butternut squash.  The short rib sauce is a veal reduction with red wine and a strong nutmeg finish.  \nCrab ravioli - 3.5 to 4 stars -pasta was perfectly cooked, sauce was light.  A very delicate dish.  The taste of crab was almost lost. Adding a touch more crab would perfect this dish.\nBurrata - 3 stars - burrata itself was amazing but bread was too soft and dish would have beed better with fresh tomatoes and olives rather than a tapenade \nCorn pudding - 4 stars - super corn delicious!  But I LOVE corn!\nBok choy - 3 stars\nHaricot vert - table said 4 stars.  I didn't try them\n1/2 lobster - 4 stars - just slightly over cooked but really ever so slightly\nFilet w/ bacon butter - 4 stars - this filet was cooked perfectly to medium rare as requested.  Nice and tender. Add\nTruffles fries - 4.5 stars - I normally do not like thick fries but these were really really good!\n\nOther things ordered at our tables caesar salad, iceberg salad, sole, skirt steak, Brussels sprouts and tuna.  I did not try these dishes but table consensus was salads were very good but Brussels sprouts and entrees were all just ok and no one would order them again.\n\nWe ended the night with a fire ball shot (who's idea was that?) and the bread pudding!  The bread pudding is not traditional.  It is more like a cake.. definitely not as dense as normal bread pudding.  I like the captain crunch pieces as the added a little extra something something!\n\nAmy was our server and she was excellent!  Service overall was impressive!\n\nUnfortunately, I probably won't come here again as it is just too noisy and you have to know what to order to really enjoy your meal.  However, if you are a group of singles looking for a good time this is your place!  This seems like a major pick up joint to see and be seen!"

We are locals and wanted to try this place for our Anniversary but I guess we weren't kewl or important enough to get a reservation as STK has taking itself off the available to the public stage and only made available to the so called elite (not that they would know who that should truly include). I am grateful to Yelp and the Open Table reviews in concert with my experience of their attitude toward locals, I know now I am not missing anything but a hyped up empty experience with so-so food & a ridiculous atmosphere. It's a true shame for such a beautiful hotel as the Cosmopolitan to be home of what is such a rude & unfriendly restaurant on the Strip. Looking forward to the closure and replacement of STK."

            "review": "Overall I was satisfied with my experience. First of all, let me say the ambiance is totally over-the-top, in a good way. The decor is white brick walls with outrageous decorations and a trendy purple lighting scheme, and it's a fairly dim restaurant. I felt like I stepped into a futuristic lounge. The wine selection is thorough, and the waiter was knowledgeable about each of the wines and the recommended pairing. They have a delicious appetizer cheese bread!! I wanted to scarf down a couple of loafs before the steak!\n\nThe main meal came approximately 25 minutes after ordering. The steak itself (strip steak, medium) was cooked exactly as specified, and the flavor was excellent. I decided to order it au poivre, but I think some of the steak's flavor was lost in the peppercorns. I wouldn't order it again this way. The sides come separately but I ordered the asparagus which was phenomenal.\n\nI would give 5 stars but we were made to wait 5 minutes for a table for an unspecified reason. No one else was waiting at the reception desk and the restaurant wasn't crowded. 4 stars."

I love a good steak and have been to many steakhouses, so I was excited to try STK.\n\nI understand that the crowd in Las Vegas can be crazy sometimes and unpredictable.  However, my friends and I arrived dressed up and composed (sober) since this was the first stop of our night.  It was pretty noisy and lively in there, which we pleasantly expected, however, the hostess did not even acknowledge us when we walked in.  The vibe was unwelcoming and seemed like we were being burdensome to ask for a table.  I would expect that if we were annoyingly drunk, but we were patient and polite. \n\nI got the bone-in rib eye and it was juicy and succulent.  We also ordered a side of potatoes, and they were a bit cold.  For the prices that I was willing to pay, I expected the potatoes to be warm at least!\n\nI see potential in STK, but not sure if I would come again.  There are so many other places in Vegas to spend your winnings..."

Stopped by here for dinner last week when in LV! Every time this place is consistently EXCELLENT!\nDRINKS: Decided on Cucumber Stiletto and OMG - it is incredible! \nFOOD: Started with the signature bread rolls (you just can't stop eating them!), then had tuna tartar - really fresh tuna with delicate spice to it, awesome presentation. Then had pork belly and WOW - so good!! My choice of the meal was beet salad and beef carpaccio (both dishes are a MUST TRY!!!). Food arrived within minutes and service was fantastic. Can't wait to come back!"
