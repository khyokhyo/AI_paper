            "review": "So I went to TC's on the reviews of my fellow Yelpers and because it's about 2 blocks from where I live. I walk in and it was your atypical mom-n-pop rib shop which I get very excited about. We got the menus and they have a lot of items but they're pricey. I'm thinking they better be good for this price. When the baby back  ribs came they basically tasted the same as Chilis (which I like but expected something different). They had a lot of fat on them and seemed to be a big part of the ribs. The fried okra was the best part of the meal, very big and well made.  Another thing that bugged me were the drinks. I ordered water and it came in this little rinky dinky small cup, maybe 8 oz. My friend orders a soda and they bring her a big 16 oz cup that just towers over mine. So at this point I was feeling it to be an average 3-star place. Decent but nothing unique but before we were to leave my friend reminded of the big reason I wanted to come...bread pudding! Quickly I ordered it up. I was excited, I love bread pudding and take respect at how hard it can be to make it let alone to make it right. Not many places have this delicacy so I jump at the chance to get some when the opportunity arises. Then it comes...the disappointment that made this a 1-star restaurant. First off let me say this bread pudding is not cheap. $6. I'm willing to pay that though for some good bread pudding. This was not it. As the waitress is handing me my dessert I'm asking how they make it. With raisins? Bourbon? What's their unique, creative touch on it? 'Krispy Kreme', she says. Say wha??? 'Its really just a 'Krispy Kreme donut that we heat up', she continues. I don't know if I've ever felt so betrayed from a restaurant. I just paid 6 freakin dollars for a donut???  \nAll in this place, less the okra, was am utter disappointment.  And if you decide on dessert, ask how it's made. Shame on you TC's."

Thanks to the yelp $10 for $20 deal I gots my belly full for a good Denny's price dealio with some real legit food. \n\nPulled pork was soft and juicy. Brisket was good...not the best. Beef ribs were soooooooo yummy, fatty, and falling off the bone. It was sheer beauty. \n\nMac and cheese side was meh for me. The baked beans were good, but I ain't no baked beans connoisseur. \n\nOne sucky thing is you can only use one yelp coupon per table. I don't get it...so if we were sitting separately we could have used two coupons we had specifically bought prior to entering. \n\nWhatever, it's a common rule so I shouldn't complain but my eyes were bigger than my stomach in the beginning so I was dead set on using two coupons to get $40 worth of food. This gigantic plate was enough to feed two. Oh and it came with corn bread, soooooooon! I've had better, so didn't finish mine. \n\nI'll be back for a full plate of beef ribs only with some fried sides next time!!!"

Service was awesome and the wait for food wasn't extremely long, either. A very pretty lady(assuming is the owner or some sort) came to our table and asked if we enjoyed our meal and gave us a free banana pudding! So nice! It's less than 5 mins away from my house so I will most definitely be back again! Especially to try their weekly specials!"

            "review": "I hate to give 2 star reviews, but there were too many things wrong with the food.  I'll start with the good.  The mac and cheese was excellent!  The Greens were also good.  The rib tips were hit and miss.  Most of them were pretty fatty and dry, some were good, but those were the minority.  The brisket was hit and miss too, but mostly miss.  The first few pieces were good, the middle was a mixed bag of okay and dry, the bottom had a chunk of brisket that was hard and in a huge clump, not appetizing and disgusting.  Even the good parts, wasn't that good.\n\nThe service was fine and the inside wasn't bad for a casual place.\n\nThe cornbread was dry, like dry dry.  The honey they had was not pure honey, it was a honey mix of corn syrup and honey.\n\nI wanted to like this place and to give it a shot and half way through the meal I was at 3 stars, but it got down to 2 stars by the end of the meal.\n\nI won't be going back.  You can give them a try and judge for yourself like I did, but there are much better bbq options in Las Vegas."

That was the first red flag. Secondly, we ordered barbecue wings and were served regular wings with barbecue sauce on it. Third most terrible thing was the catfish. The fish fillets were identical in shape and size, I could immediately tell it was from the freezer! The blan fish lacked simple seasons like salt and pepper, to say the least.\n\nThis is not soul nor quality food.\n\nThere's a reason for the Yelp deal here."

            "review": "I was feeling the mood too try something new in my area of town. I know this place has won best of las vegas review journal awards although that was few years back. Since then the competition comes too barbeque has stepped up with new places on top of the established ones. So some ways going in it was going too be tough too stand out. I always always give any place benefit of open mind and like try new places get my own take on it. Really TC's Rib Crib never had any WOW factor too the food I tasted. It was average barbeque at best with average sides. Really even though this location is on my side of town would much rather drive farther too get more authentic barbeque on.\n\nI ended up ordering the pulled pork (I always fail too get it sandwich style or forget) with choice of two sides and comes with cornbread. I settled on fried okra and mac/cheese for my sides. The amount of pulled pork they give you actually decent size for the price you pay. I wished it covered in more sauce. They ask you when food comes out if want more barbeque sauce. I did. The tables can dine inside none of them automatically have barbeque sauce as set condiments. I found odd considering it is barbeque joint? I not much fan of the barbeque sauce felt like it lacked depth, rather bland, and nice if had few options too choose from. The sides I did enjoy the fried okra!!!! Really just diced okra battered and fried. It nice golden brown, crispy on the outside, and nice hot and moist on the inside. The mac and cheese wished could have been more creamy and cheesy. It was ok. The cornbread was pretty good. Maybe I needed too the order the ribs but suppose save that for another visit...Maybe.\n\nThe service was good. They asked if wanted too dine in or take out. The gentlemen asked if wanted more barbeque sauce. Attentive. They have really cheap lunch special and great groupon deal going right now. It small place so can fill up fast if it gets busy. I went during weekday for dinner so only one in the restaurant."

I go a two meat combo, sausage and brisket with two sides.  I loved the sausage, but the brisket I didn't care for.  I think it's more like roast beef, cut into thin strips, there is no smoke line, and it reminds me a lot of my mothers Sunday roast beef.  \n\nMy husband got a slab of ribs and they were very good, so if I come back, I will skip the brisket."

            "review": "And to think someone asked me to reconsider my trip to TC's and head over to Famous Dave's.  What a sucker.\n\nTC's southern BBQ delivered especially at such an affordable price.  The offered  $10 for $20 deal was worth up, but keep in mind.. Their prices are super reasonable, so dessert would be in order to make this deal worth the while.\n\nMy beau and I ordered the Ribs, chicken wings, sweet potato fries and red beans and rice with cornbread on the side.  The Ribs fell off the bone as they should.  Delicious!  Ribs are typically the deciding factor for me when it comes to a BBQ joint winning.  They delivered!  Chicken wings were spicy and overcooked (per my request) perfectly.  Red Beans and Rice and Sweet Potato Fries weren't as tasty as anticipated, but I'm a picky southerner, so TC's probably didn't stand a chance before I even walked through the door in that arena.  The rice was a little under-cooked and tasted as if it came from a box.  The sweet potato fries were missing the whole sweet factor.  Just not great, albeit I gladly wolfed them down!\n\nThis place is very casual, small and made me feel like I was in DC/NOLA all over again.  I was there to get my greasy needs met, and they accomplished that and then some.  Also, the servings are decent, so I had some wings to go for a late night feast.  The service was nice as well.  However, I noticed they only had one server doing all the seating and serving, and even though it was quick for my visit, I would recommend a little patience.. she only has two hands, people.\n\nOh, and they had kool-aid!  Kool-aid!  I used to involuntarily drink that sugary mess in college due to lack of funds, so it was fun to drink some a few years later!  Maybe a wee bit too sugary to my liking.  I bet the kiddies would beg to differ."

Ordered delivery 20 min before they closed!!! Ordered the half chicken and the three meat combo (brisket, pulled pork rib tips) with Mac and cheese and green beans. Fed 2 people with left overs. Rib tips were fatty. I thought they were gross. Wasn't a fan of the pork or brisket. The chicken and sides were AMAZING!!  4 stars because I wasn't forced to order Chinese or Thai (which is one step up from cracking a can of soup and eating it cold) but if it wasn't for the delivery factor I would have given 2. Oh and I selected the \"make it all white meat\" option and was charged $2 extra on the chicken... But they delivered dark and white. I also tried to order the chicken without the all white meat option and I wasn't able to. Over all it's an amazing alternative to Chinese or Thai."

First impression - I really liked the decor which had great, vibrant color along with tasteful framed photographs on the wall which made you feel right at home.  This is exactly what I want from a barbecue joint -clean, tasteful, casual, and homey.\n\nService was prompt, friendly and attentive throughout.  The food was the real deal - plenty of  great tasting pulled pork with just a bit of sauce on the bun and great coleslaw to go on top.  My girlfriend got a two meat combo with beef ribs, hot links, and two sides which she said was also good.  The peach cobbler was great - and I don't even like peaches!  I can't wait to try the glazed donut bread pudding.\n\nI'm kicking myself that I've lived down the street from TC's for two years and this was only my first time there.  They've got a ton of lunch specials for only $4.99 and daily specials. 'll definitely be back soon."

I chose the chicken breast, beef brisket and rib tips with cole slaw and onion rings.  My chicken tasted like it had been baked, slathered with sauce then left in the fridge for the last couple of days.  It was definately reheated and not fresh. The rib tips were char burned, not smoked.  My brisket was actually pretty tasty, but still not smoked.  There was nothing special about the coleslaw or the onion rings....My husband got the  rib tips, pulled chicken and pulled pork with potato salad and sweet potato fries.  The rib tips were all char burned, his  pulled chicken was dry and bland.   His pulled pork was pretty much the same.  Their potato salad was awfull, it had no good flavors, but lots of mushy potatoes and not enough sauce.  His sweet potato fries had good flavor but were way undercooked and soggy.  Their cornbread was too dry so we didn't eat it.  All in all this was very disappointing.

I ordered the family meal deal which you get your choice of 4 different meats, 3 sides, 1 fried side, and corn bread or white bread. My choices were:\n1.) Brisket - covered in bbq sauce that wasn't too tart or too sweet\n2.) Rib tips - tender and covered with the same sauce\n3.) Pork links - sliced in half with nice char marks. A bit salty though.\n4.) Baby back ribs - so tender you don't need a knife.\n5.) Baked beans - I am not normally a fan of beans but I enjoy this. It's a great compliment to the greens\n6. Greens - very salty but good when combined with the beans\n7.) Mac n cheese - could be cheesier but i like how the flavors are a bit mellow since you have the strong flavors from the bbq\n8.) Fried okra - love these little bits of goodness\nFinally, 9.) Corn bread - it should really be called mini corn muffins. My only complaint with these is that it's way too small. I love me some corn muffins.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and very professional. The food is pretty on point with good flavors and tenderness. Overall, this is my go to place for bbq in Vegas. Now all I got to do is go there for their fish fry"

They have some good bbq and sides and pretty decent prices.  \n\nThe pulled pork is the main event here for me, although I confess during the whole span I've never tried the ribs. I was just never a huge fan of ribs in general. The brisket is well cooked and the links are nice and spicy. They have rib tips which I've had and they are very good and at 8.99 for a plate of them with 2 sides and cornbread, it's honestly almost too much to finish. They also have chicken and waffles, and their waffles are seriously good eats.  The sides are plentiful and they have different ones each day. I always get the fried cabbage when it's on the menu because its delicious, and the macNcheese is not bad either. The deserts are all homemade and the ones that I've tried are good. They had this oreo pie that is to die for, but the last few times I've visited it's not been there =(  Also theres kool aid on the drink menu, its like 1.50 or so for a giant cup with refills. Purple please. Oh yes.  \n\nI've never had a problem with the service, though my visits are like 70% takeout, 30% dine in probably. The girls that work there are nice and the chef has come out to greet once or twice. It's very friendly and  inviting atmosphere in the dining room, so I would recommend at least one visit to see if you enjoy it as much as I do."

I ordered the mac and cheese, fried okra, and sweet potato tots. The mac wasn't creamy, but it sure was cheesy! The okra was also good. I really liked the slightly sweet and flavorful barbecue sauce that they brought out to the table. The Arnold Palmer (iced tea and lemonade) tasted just right.\n\nTC's has an unbelievable deal for lunch specials on Tuesday, when 2 people can eat for $4.99. They have different specials each day of the week, but this one really stood out.\n\nI was checking out the display case full of desserts up front by the cashier, contemplating a slice of coconut cake for later, when something else caught my eye. Glazed donut bread pudding? Are you kidding me? I should have listened to the cook, who told me to get two orders. He knew what he was talking about. There were bits of peach, plump raisins, and walnuts under the donuts, and the whole thing was topped with cream cheese frosting. It's crazy. I bet it goes well with a cup of coffee.\n\nAnd tomorrow, I will go to the gym."

It was sad how much of my plate was left it looked as though they hadnt even been eaten. The sides i got were baked beans and candied yams. The beans were basically buschs canned beans. Nothing homemade about them. The yams were so saturated in the thick sweet honeylike paste that they were too sweet to even eat. They were also super overcooked so that made them really mushy. Overall... They get two stars for the bbq sauce and the pepsi. :/ wont be coming back."

The restaurant is comfortably decorated; I like the red tone to it.  And the menu is a simple size while still offering sufficient options.\n\nThe date and I each got our own 2 meat combo with 2 sides and cornbread.  I ordered the baby back ribs, beef brisket, mac and cheese, and Big Sam's baked beans.  Unfortunately, our meals came out sans cornbread, but we asked for it mid-meal and a piping hot paper tray of two pieces of cornbread (they were really muffins) came out.  No butter, not that I needed the calories, but it would've been a nice addition.  And they were just okay.\n\nThe baby back rib meat peeled off the bone easily with my fork.  The first bite made me nervous - it was dry.  I kept digging and the meat in the middle was moist.  I don't know what happened, but the moist rib meat was good.  The ribs tasted more steamed than BBQ'd though.  I was really craving a smokier flavor.\n\nThe beef brisket was good; it was tender and juicy.  It paired very well with their homemade BBQ sauce.\n\nThe mac and cheese and beans came out in styrofoam containers.  That made me nervous thinking that they store their premade sides in the containers and warm them up to order.  But, it did come in handy for taking the sides home since there were plenty of leftovers.  The cheese on the mac and cheese was clumpy and not melted into the normal smooth sauce I was expecting.  It was an odd consistency, but it tasted okay.  The beans were also okay.  Both benefited from a healthy shake of salt and pepper.\n\nMy favorite meat was actually the pork links that my date ordered.   They were perfectly salty and had a wonderful smokey char.  They were also beautifully grilled with lovely black grill marks.  I could've eaten just those and been happy all day.\n\nIn conclusion, it was okay, but unfortunately not the best BBQ in the valley.  Aside from the smokey flavor missing in some meats, we were also wondering where the BBQ smell was.  The restaurant and parking lot were both missing the potent and mouthwatering fragrance commonly associated with BBQ places.  This left us both to wondering where and how the meats were being prepared."

All were terrific. The corn bread is the best I've ever had. Cole slaw was excellent. The only thing not outstanding were the french fries; there was nothing wrong with them, but they were just O.K. Crinkle cut fries would be perfect.\n\nWe were there on a Friday night and the place was almost empty. What is wrong with the people of Vegas?

This place tried to have soul food, but it was greatly apparent that they really don't know how to cook, let alone make soul food.\n\nUpon the return visit, we tried catfish and it was so terrible that I couldn't even finish one whole piece. The \"catfish fillets\" were obviously pre-battered and precooked (where the person in the back just dumped them in the oil) because there was a lack of seasoning, the pieces were cookie-cutter shape, and they were so dark from re-frying them.\n\nThe crazy thing is that some dude said that everything was fine.\n\nIf you want edible food- STAY AWAY!!"

The reviews on Yelp seemed promising and the pictures on Instagram looked great; however, we were not very satisfied with this purchase.  The meats were actually good.  I had pulled pork and brisket, very juicy and tender.  My boyfriend had ribs and chicken, which he also thought were flavorful and juicy.  The sides were very subpar.  The macaroni and cheese was dry and pretty bland.  We also did not care for the potato salad.  The greatest disappointment was that we ordered a side of catfish and were charged $12.99 for two very small fish fillets (basically the size of a chicken finger each).  This was only for the fish fillets, did not include any sides at all. TC ribs should be embarrassed to charge their customers this.  Additionally, the online menu stated the cost for my two meat combo was $15.99, yet I was charged $17.99 instead.  The cornbread was decent, but we were told in placing the order we would receive 3 pieces and there were only 2 packaged when we arrived home.  Finally, we were greatly disappointed in the desserts.  My chocolate cake had that refridgerator taste when something has been in refrigerater too long.  Also, my boyfriend is from Louisianna and Peach Cobbler is his absolute favorite desert, yet he only ate about 1/4 of it.. He is not one to complain, but this man never has any food leftover on his plate.  Thank God we were able to use the $10 for $20 Yelp deal, otherwise our bill was almost $70 for a very subpar meal.  Needless to say we will definitely not be dining here again."

Then ordered again for a 3rd time just to make sure the 2nd time wasn't a mistake and it again was too chunky. I'm talking too chunky like I had to chop 1 piece of a potato into 3 smaller pieces. \nWhich one is it, chunky or nah?\n\nThe Mac and cheese tasted like like a doctored up box of Velvetta Mac and cheese. \n\nAgain this food is classified under \"Soul Food\".\n\nMaybe sell grilled steaks and burgers and become an all American restaurant b/c your sides aren't good.

I'm a huge Mac and cheese snob, my grandma made the best, and this stuff is (sorry grandma) even better! Creamy and cheesy but not swimming in sauce. \n\nDo yourself a favor and come try them!\n\nSide Note: I wish yelp's ordering app Eat24 had an option to add a side of cornbread it looks so good but wasn't on there to order!"

I was thinking it was going to all come out wrong. The food came and WHOA! The best brisket I have found in Vegas! The sweet potatoes were perfect, the ribs fell right off the bone in tenderness. Mac and cheese was boring and dry, hoping grandmas Mac will improve. The manager came by and suggested dessert, which we took home after being so full. It hit the spot later that night! Food is absolutely worth the strange atmosphere and ambiance. The team was hospitable and fun, just keep training your newbie so next time will be a little more seamless."

TC's is a hole in the wall decorated like your grandma's house with family pictures, place mats and friendly faces. If you are lucky you just might get to meet TC while you are here! I always get the pulled pork because it never let's me down. It's tender, juicy and shredded to the perfect consistency. You are responsible for putting the amount of BBQ sauce you like on your meat. I also always get the mac n cheese that is to die for. Don't leave out the fried okra, ribs, grilled chicken salad, sweet potato fries, etc. You can wash it all down with sweet tea or Kool Aide. Dessert is not to be missed. At the top of that list is the banana pudding and glazed donut bread pudding. Yes, that just happened! Every single person I have brought to TC's has been back and brought their friends, too! They get the five stars because they are reasonably priced, delicious food, and most excellent service.

I believe the mixed reviews have alot to do with the inconsistency in freshness that I've sometimes experienced here myself. I think the time of day and week you happen to order or dine in has alot to do with it here, as it can be hit or miss in that department. I have ordered when the food was hot off the grill and the meat was melting off the bones. I've also ordered when the ribs were not just made and the sides definitely appeared to be reheated. There is a huge difference but chalked it up to coming during a rather vacant time of day. This is a small family business and I think if you are smart about when you order or arrive during a fairly busy time, you will get your food alot fresher. I order around dinner time closer to weekends when there's a line out the door and I'm never disappointed. I recommend the spare ribs, mac n cheese and potato salad is good. I wasn't too impressed with the cakes I've tried but I'll try the pudding next."

The ribs  and chicken wings were cooked nicely. The cole slaw was good as well.  No complaints there. The problems were with the following:\n\nCornbread: very odd, off-tasting, bland, giving the experience of eating a gummy lump of flavorless dough. I wanted to like it but there wasn't anything to go on. \n\nCatfish: fried nicely, but tasted like thawed out store fish. Overloaded with salt.\n\nMacaroni and cheese: bland, flavorless. We guessed all the salt was used on the fish. \n\nFrench fries- tasted like the frozen potatoes we imagine they started as. Easily became cardboard-like. No flavor. \n\nPeach cobbler: by far the most disappointing. The only sweetness came from the peaches. The dough was just gloppy and flavorless. Where was the sugar? The vanilla? \n\nOur meal felt like a series of memory lapses where seasonings were forgotten. This sounds like a one-star review but I added a star because we enjoyed the BBQ ribs and chicken. When you spend money you want EVERYthing to taste good!"

            "review": "**Summary**\n       - Ribs - The spare ribs were probably one of the best ribs I've ever had. The meat inside was just so tender. The bbq sauce was just perfect with fire-kissed crust.\n       - Homemade - Almost all of their non-fried sides are homemade. It gives the food a more family feeling.\n       - Location - They used to be over on Dessert Inn but moved to a roomier location. They also changed their phone number and didn't update yelp until recently.\n       - Price - The prices are a bit steep if you're eating for one. I usually share a three meat combo, so it ends up being about $9 a person. Trust me when I say, it's a lot of food.\n       - Consistency - It seems people either really like or really hate the place. Even something like the meatiness of the ribs is up for debate. I don't know if it's a consistency problem.\n**Ordered**\n       - $17.99 Three Meat Combo with 2 sides and cornbread muffins.\n          - 1/4 Rack (3 bones) Baby Back Ribs (Pork) - Fire-smoked and crispy on the outside with their homemade bbq sauce. Meaty and juicy on the inside. It's a step above your overcooked Tony Roma's or Famous Dave's ribs.\n          - 1/4 Rack (3 bones) Spare Ribs (Pork) - I'd prefer the spare ribs over the baby back because they had more meat and were thicker. This meant there was a lot more fall off the bone meat between the smoked crispy crust and the bone.\n          - Beef Brisket - The bbq sauce, though the same as the ribs, just seemed too sweet. The brisket was not thick sliced like I was use to. It was thinly sliced like bulgogi. I probably wouldn't get this again.\n          - Candied Yams - Homemade and caramelized to perfection.\n          - Wedge Cut Fries - Crispy on the outside, cooked just right on the inside.\n          - Cornbread muffins - Also homemade, they were sweet and delicious. For an extra dose of diabetes, you can add honey on top.\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for some calorific soul food. I'd choose your meats/sides wisely however. Reading the other reviews and my own experience, the items are either really good or really bad."

It is a small place, with about 5 tables along one side and a larger table right in front and 2 tables outside. The service was great. The girls there was very nice and made sure we were taken care of.\n\nThe sides all seemed so good I wanted to try everything! But I didn't want to go overboard. Just figured if I liked it, I can always come back and try more. So me and my bf ordered a full slab of ribs (baby back) in the combo with mac n cheese and fried okra as our sides. They had waffled sweet potato fries that day and best believe I got that too!! (pictures posted). I was ready to wait the 20+ minute for the food as the sign said, but the food came out surprisingly quick! Though, not all at once.\n\nSo... the mac and cheese was great! Tasted very homemade and slightly gritty like they used ricotta cheese in it. Not as rich and creamy as I am used to, but the bf loved it. I really liked the fried okra, though the bf didn't care for that. But you can't go wrong with sweet potato fries, especially waffled! Yum! Very crisp but not greasy.\n\nThe cornbread was a bit disappointing. It came out a bit after the other stuff so I figured it was just being baked or something, but it didn't seem that way. It was somewhat dry and bland. Sadly, I really like the cornbread from Famous Daves! And the ribs, it was good flavor. And not overly saucy. But a bit dry. The first bite of the ribs were great..! But maybe they cooled quickly and became really dry that I didn't want to have more (like I usualy do).\n\nOverall, the sides were great but the ribs were not the best, though not bad. I wanted to try the dessert, but didn't yet. Service was great. The place was clean. Gotta try the pulled pork and desserts next time! I will be back!"

Dined in the restaurant tonight and this is my take:\n\nThe restaurant atmosphere was simple, clean, and very relaxed. Almost like an order-at-the-counter-then-seat-yourself kind of place. There was indeed table service albeit not the friendliest, but also not bad. BF and I decided to share the full rack of baby backs plus two sides: beans and potato salad. Everything came out in speedy time (there were maybe 3 other tables of people) and was warm, but let me tell you, this is not a place that concerns themselves with presentation. Everything was served in single use paper or plastic containers - the sides even had lids on them! Not a big deal but almost made me wonder, \"What did we get ourselves into?\". Aesthetics aside everything was good. I thought the potato salad was a nice consistency and balanced, very complimentary to the BBQ. The beans were basic and enjoyable. The ribs came out barely wet but extra sauce was offered immediately. Once sauced up to my liking we dug in and were very pleased. Great taste, extremely meaty, and very tender. My only complaint is that there are little bits of bone and gristle to be picked out but that's sort of expected in place like this. The cornbread that came with the meal left much to be desired which is kind of surprising for a rib place. Overall, for the price we paid we were well-fed and our rib craving was satisfied. We even took about half the rack home. Would definitely return and recommend this place to friends. \n\nTIP: we used the Yelp $10 for $20 so we only ended up paying $6 (plus tip). There were tons of specials listed, too, like 2 for 1 Tuesday lunches so that makes this place even more of a bargain."

This could easily become and addiction! \n\nIf you do come here please keep in mind they make everything fresh so it may take up to 20 min for your order but it's well worth it!

Being completely honest, this is the worst brisket I've ever had. I really don't even think they should call it brisket, it's that bad. The only thing I can compare it to is that boxed Philly cheese steak meat that comes frozen in super thin sheets. Only it's been freezer burned and overcooked to the point of leather-like texture. The link wasn't nearly as bad but definitely nothing special. As far as the sides go, the cornbread was bland and dry and the greens were straight bitter with absolutely no flavor. About the only thing worth noting on the plate was the okra...not too heavy on the breading and fried just right but still lacking flavor. My wife had a pulled pork sandwich...other than being way better then the other two meats on my plate, it still was just a basic sandwich and nowhere near worth the $9 price tag. Their sauce is ok but more sweet then anything and they don't even keep bottles of sauce on the table for you. Who does that?!\n\nI'm really only giving this place two stars because their banana pudding was decent. Other than that, this was just a bad stop for me all around. The service was terrible, the food was even worse and it's highly overpriced. We used the Yelp $10 for $20 deal but still ended up paying $21 out of pocket.

I'm always hungry after a workout.  anything will taste good.  i dunno living in Austin for just 4 years made me a snob.  i dunno, but this was disappointed.  it's a pricey place.  i had a two meat combo (rib tips and 2 sausages) + corn bread + 2  sides.  the sausage was good, firm, sweet, tangy, and had that classic crunch when you bite into it.  the rib tips were just thick pieces of brisket.  it was dry, hard, and no fat to make it seem more moist other than the sauce.  it wasn't like the rib tips at Famous Daves.  also the sauce had no spicy kick at all.  for the sides i had fried okra, which was dry and just weirdly off.  maybe it had too much batter.  the macaroni cheese was ok, not spectacular, but i think kraft cheese and macaroni is way better.  the good thing here is that they have big cups of ooh so sweet tea.  I'm so sad about the bbq, i need to go back to famous daves to make up for it...maybe this weekend."

            "review": "The GF and I stopped by this place about a week ago for some good ol' Que. This place is fairly small and most of the employees seemed to be family.\n\nI was fairly hungry and figured \"I'm at the rib crib, I should order the ribs.\" (usually not what I order at BBQ). I ordered the full rack baby backs with 2 sides for......$18.... I think. My sides were the sweet potato fries and mac and cheese.  The GF ordered \"Lots O' Meat Deal\". She ordered the pulled pork and 2 orders of brisket (the girl loves her some brisket) with sweet potato fries and fried okra. I think it was about $15. \n \nSo our food came out in a timely manner and we started gobbling it up. My ribs were very tender. The first bone I picked up slid out of the meat. They weren't soggy but not dry either. I can't tell you how much I LOVED THE BBQ SAUCE. The ribs seemed to be boiled then grilled... not the way I usually enjoy them (smoked.......mmmm....) but none the less very tasty. The sweet potato fries were crispy not mushy like most, very good, and the mac and cheese wasn't the creamy version but more of a casserole type...not the best but pretty good. Oh ya and the cornbread was not very good... I don't think I even ate it all...that's very unusual. I'm a cornbread junkie.\n\nThe GF's plate was filled with SO MUCH MEAT!!!!!!!! AHA.... I just wanted to shove my face into the plate and inhale....what a great death that would be..... anyways......2 huge portions of brisket and a huge helping of pulled pork. I have to say everything on her plate was defiantly worth eating again. Brisket was nicely sliced and the pork was extremely soft and tender. As far as I could tell none of their meat is smoked but as I said before it was still very good. Her fried okra was also good and I'm not a huge okra fan.\n\nDidn't try any of the desserts (had to save room for AYCE sushi 4 hours later) but they all looked fabulous. \n\nI would officially give this place 3.5 stars but I'm gonna round up not down for the yelp score. Service was great and everyone was extremely friendly. \n\nTHE BBQ SAUCE AT THIS JOINT IS ON POINT!!!!\n\nCheck 'em out... I recommend the \"Lots O' Meat Meal Deal\".... it's a lot of food for a real good price and you can sample three things they offer at the same time."

At first I thought it was someone's house but then I saw it was a real shop and my hopes rose as I love BBQ and hole in the wall places are usually the best.     Well finally my family and I gave it a try.  First   The menu was promising and I am kicking myself for not trying the Catfish Fry-Day special. Instead we went for the three meat combo and our daughter tried the two rib kids meal.   The baked beans and cornbread  were excellent and the potato salad not bad.  The barbecue sauce had a lot of flavor and spice.  However, there was way too much sauce on the food even for us BBQ lovers.  The spare ribs were tough and chewy instead of tender.  The pulled pork might as well been a bowl of sauce as the meat's only flavor came from the mass of sauce.  The brisket was unique, almost a greek gyro cut (very thin and bendable like ribbon) but was also chewy and overcooked.  The atmosphere was nice but the staff mostly seemed overworked resulting in a long time between drink refills.  The YELP coupon definitely made this a value buy and the $4.99 lunch specials and kids prices make it a bargain for the value conscious but if you are looking for the perfect BBQ, you will be disappointed.  It appears from the mixed reviews that this place may be hit or miss depending on the chef or how busy they are but It won't be in my main rotation.  I will however give it another shot one day just to see if I caught a bad day."

A quaint BBQ joint, you can eat there or grab some take out, but given the treat-you-like-family service I recommend staying for a bit. I once ate there solo and a table of elderly customers nearby was laughing so hard it was contagious and I started laughing with them. That's the kind of behavior this food incites. Laughing with complete strangers.\n\nIt sounds clich\u00e9 but you can't go wrong on the menu. A combo plate for your first time visit is probably best, from there you can come back weekly, daily, hourly for what you deem your favorite. I am loyal to the pulled pork (sometimes chicken) plate with sweet potato fries and coleslaw. I'm starving just writing this. It's 10:30am. The gargantuan drinks will ensure you are far from parched, and though I'm not wild about sweet tea others have reported to me it's just like what you get in the south. \n\nThe desserts are also great, provided you can even shove anything else into your stomach due to the hearty portions. Sweet potato pie, pecan pie...all fabulous and available to purchase in full pie form for holidays or special occasions. \n\n Make it a point to stop by TC's Rib Crib. It will absolutely scratch your BBQ itch."

You get a choice of 4 meats: pulled pork, pulled chicken, 1/2 chicken, 1/2 rack ribs, or brisket. So I ordered full rack, beef brisket, and pulled pork each. The full rack looked like a half and the bottom side was burnt black :( I liked the brisket but boyfriend thought pulled pork was lacking flavor. Cornbread was dry for me.\n\nEach platter included 4 sides. Had regular fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings. Each has maybe 5-7 pieces. Coleslaw, Mac n cheese, and potato salad were good. I don't even really like potato salad so that means something. However, this place is known for ribs.... Not sides. I had high expectations for this place and I was rather disappointed esp since I was so happy to bring 6 others (parents, aunts, and uncles). $110 for the platters plus 4 sodas. More expensive for what it was worth. We didn't even get real plates. (Disposables and to go side containers)\n\nAlthough I was not satisfied with the food, service was friendly and prompt."

I had them throw in a slice of Coconut Cake, all of their deserts were sitting there staring at me, I couldn't resist.\nPortion size was fine but I could've made better food on our backyard grill and stove. BBQ sauce was on the vinegary side but had an almost bad meat taste to it. Chicken was just ok, nothing special, cooked to stay moist but flavor overall was lacking. Ribs were over charred and dry. Mac and cheese was mushy and bland, not enough cheese flavor. Corn bread was dry and tasteless. Potato salad was about the best thing we got and that's not saying much. The Coconut Cake tasted like it was cooked with suntan lotion, tasted artificial, I couldn't get past the first bite. \nSo in short, sadly, we won't be back."

But when they find out you're here for dining in, they'll have you take a seat for a full service experience.\n\nWe wanted a taste of it all, so the BF and I ordered up one of their \"Lots O' Meat Meal Deals\" for any combination of three meats, cornbread and two sides for $14.99.  Of the meats, we chose the Beef Tips, Links (2), and 1/4 Baby Back Rib Slab.  You can also choose Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket, Beef Ribs, Spare Ribs, or 1/4 Chicken.  Or sides, we chose the Grandma Georgia's Macaroni and Cheese and the Fried Okra.  Other sides include Aunt Ada's Potato Salad, Big Sam's Baked Beans, Cousin Joe's Greens, Uncle Earl's Coleslaw, Sweet Potato French Fries, Fried Jalapenos, and few other staples.\n\nThis meal was plenty for the two of us!  The Beef Tips were more like chunks of meat, not as tender as I would have hoped.  The Links were pretty grub though, a  nice crunch and texture and pretty tasty.  The Baby Back Ribs were okay.  The first rib I got has little meat on it, the second rib had more though.  We got a generous portion of fried okra, more than what they give you at M & M Soul Food Cafe.  It's breaded up and could use a bit more zing though.  The Macaroni and Cheese is a bit different with a grainy texture.  It's tasty, but  I guess it all depends if you like your mac and cheese creamy or not.  \n\nThey also serve up some Sweet Tea for $1.49 or $2.49.  Don't be a fool and get the small cup, go for the super large one instead!  Yum yum!  \n\nThey have a bucket load of desserts to choose from the Friday early evening we showed up!  Banana pudding, Coconut Cake, Snickers Cake, Homemade Louisiana Pralines, Glazed Donut Bread Pudding, etc.  It's definitely worth taking a look at their dessert display!\n\nWe also ordered a Full Slab of Baby Back Ribs with 2 Sides and Cornbread for $18.99 to go.\n\nThey have a Kids' Menu for $3.49 for those ten and under.  Kids eat free on Mondays with the purchase of an adult meal too!  They also serve up Burgers and Sammies, Chicken, and Catfish (on Fridays only)!\n\nFood is a solid three star, but the service is a four.  The wait didn't take 20 minutes like it was posted it can, so that's a good thing.  They come by and check up on you, get refill on your drinks if that's what you got, etc.  You can tell they have a lot of return customers here.  My big concern is seeing a bunch of older people with obvious health problems chowing down on not so health conscious food choices!\n\n(Of course you can find our hearty meal pics in the business profile!)"

Take this from a guy who's experienced a lot of barbecue in his time...it's NOT good.  It ruined the pulled pork and beef brisket for me by completely overpowering it; however, the baby back ribs were \"okay\" (read: not fall-off-the-bone).  By the way, the brisket is sliced into very thin strips, which doesn't even make it taste like brisket.

Yes, the service is NO good but the waiters and waitresses are clearly nieces, nephews, etc. of the two owners, and it's no reason to denote any stars considering such small businesses need support from friends, family, and their customers. The meats are always delicious, the mac and cheese is phenomenal, and don't forget to ask about their daily dessert for only a dollar (I'm a fan of the banana pudding). I also like the fried okra. The quarter chicken lunch special with all white meat is only $5.99 and PLENTY of food. Regular lunch specials (entree and side) are $4.99 before 3pm any day and on Tuesdays lunch specials are 2 for 1. Can't beat feeding two people for five bucks anywhere, especially with food like this. If youre feeling adventurous, I also recommend the chicken and waffles. The owners (husband and wife) are wonderful, and if they are there during your visit, don't miss out on a conversation with them. \n\nOverall, this place is small, family run, and delicious.

            "review": "As far as southern style BBQ goes, it was 3-3.5 stars.\n\nBefore I get into the review, you know those Yelp deals? They really shouldn't put the % savings because you never really save that much. You always spend more than what the voucher is worth. If you save a dollar, the ad should say you save a dollar, not 50%. It's really misleading. \n\nAnyway, we got the $20 for $10 deal, and ended up spending an extra $27 plus tip. 50% my a$$. We got two combo plates: Full rack of spare ribs plus two sides ($25) and 3-meat plate plus two sides ($20). \n\nThe full rack was 8 or 9 good sized bones. The BBQ was fair meaning not the most tender, flavorful ever but not dry or rubbery either. The sides weren't very good though. The onion rings looked and tasted soggy with oil. The mac n cheese was just so-so. The corn bread was dry and saw-dusty. \n\nThe 3-meat combo consisted of pulled pork, beef rib tips, and brisket. The brisket was a pile of confetti but still tasted okay. The tips and pork weren't bad either. And, the portions were large but not impressive. \n\nThe coleslaw was decent but the foam cup it came in was filled less than full. Why does every place skimp on the slaw? It's just cabbage and watered down mayo!  The sweet potato fries were meh but at least somewhat less oil sogged than the rings. \n\nWe got a squeeze bottle of their house BBQ sauce with our order but resisted the urge to spurge on the loaded bottle because that stuff is loaded with sugar. There were also 4 different brands of hot sauce on the table as well as the usual round of salt, pepper, more sugar and honey. The hot sauces, frankly, all tasted almost identical to me but they added some interest. \n\nAlso interesting were the many black and white photos from Afro-American history displayed on all the walls. The overall deco was quaint and simple with a mild touch of southern charm. The staff was very friendly except for the lady at the front who seemed a bit gruff when we first walked in but eventually got around to smiling later on. \n\nOverall, we had a pleasant experience and the food gets a solid 3 and 3.5 for the BBQ portion. It would've a sure 4 if the sides were better, but the friendly service made up for it."

The service was HORRIBLE. I walked into the restaurant around 8pm and the waitress asked me was my order for take out or dine in,  I told her Dine in.  She handed me a menu and just looked at me. \"I said OK do I seat myself or do I wait for you to get me a table?\". She told me to seat anywhere.  She comes and takes my order 5 minutes later, and after taking my order she walks to another table and begins talking and hanging out for almost 10 minutes before she puts my order in to the kitchen. I waited almost 25 minutes to get my food. All I ordered was sausage.  When I  the world of cooking has it ever taken anyone 25 minutes to cook 2 sausage links? Mind you that their were only myself and one other customer in the entire establishment. So they definitely wasn't busy. I almost walked out. A guy brought me my food and apologized to me for the wait and told me that the employees were playing around in the back kitchen area. He was a really cool guy. He put on the Warriors game for me and tried to have small talk. While I was eating, my waitress never came and checked on me not once nor refill my water. But she did find the time to come out to talk to one of her friends or daughter.  It was hard to say what the relationship was based on how she was talking heads to her. Her conversation was about going outside to fight. I know she was joking about it though. Anyways, when I was done she never even brought me my receipt.  I had to walk up to the counter to pay my bill and the waitress was ringing me up and she didn't know where my bill was. Smh. ...... Are you kidding me.  She was about to ring me up on someone else's bill. This is what happens when you don't pay attention to your job. When she found my bill, I paid it and I refused to leave a tip. TIP for what? She didn't work for it. This is a family owned business and now i see why its hard to hire family members because they feel like they dont have to work hard or think they'll get a pass because they work for family. Overall, I was disappointed for many reasons.  I really like the food but the bad service makes me not want to come back."

I never like to say I had the \"best\" anything, but I honestly think this is the best I have ever had and the best I will ever come across. A few days ago, I went to one of Wolfgang Puck's branches and ordered a side of mac n' cheese, hoping that I would taste something comparable...not even close. The mac and cheese at T.C.'s had a very nice creamy base--not too artery-clooging heavy, but just the right amount of goodness. It also had little pieces of cheese (dried parmesian?) sprinkled throughout, which is why I loved it soooo much. Cheesy tastiness on top of more cheesy tastiness!\n\nI also ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which also did not let me down at all. Very tender and great barbeque sauce."

My wife and I split the three-meat combo and a sandwich. It was good quality -- not the best BBQ I've ever had at a restaurant, but still good -- but definitely less food than I expected for the price. We were told that the three-meat combo alone was enough for two people, but it isn't. They were also out of brisket and rib tips by the time I arrived (6:30 PM), which meant I couldn't even get what I wanted. So...decent food, not worth the price.\n\nThe staff was friendly enough. The only point of contention arose when the Yelp voucher was presented, the terms of which did not specify one voucher per party (I was with a party of 13). The staff was nice enough to allow us to use one voucher per table (we had five tables) anyway."

Yes, we still noticed the lack of BBQ smells in the air outside and especially inside the restaurant.\nLike I said before- don't miss out on their $10 for $20 Yelp deal, or $12 for $20 Groupon deal (why wouldn't you use Yelp!). It makes this place worth it!\nThis time we tried a three meat combo- \nBeef ribs were pretty fatty and meat was a little tough for my preference. My boyfriend, thought it was \"aight.\"\nPulled pork was very tender as pulled pork should be. A little salty, but missing something. Their BBQ sauce did the trick. Very large portion! \nBrisket flavor was the best of all three meats we had. Large portion of this too. \nMac and Cheese was on the blander side on its own- I added pulled pork, some hot sauce & BBQ sauce to it and had myself a delicious pulled pork Mac and cheese.\nCorn bread was not the business. Dry & flavorless. Maybe it needed butter. Was just there for substance than anything. \nWe also had the banana pudding for dinner. Maybe the best thing we had at TC's! I wish I wasn't so full so I could have enjoyed this more. I think I will be stopping by here for banana pudding when my sweet tooth kicks in :-). \nGood service as well- all of the girls who helped wait on us were sweet. \n\nTL;DR- $10 for $20 on Yelp. Get it. Brisket is where it's at. Get banana bread pudding for dessert. Large portions and affordable price."

I never understand why people who review restaurants don't post photos of what the place looks like inside. Comfortable enough tables and chairs. A divider between tables, giving you a little privacy.\nWe were seated immediately, and waited upon in a courteous and prompt manner. Two different people came to our table a few times to ask if everything was all right.\nWe ordered three different dishes and they were all very good. I had the barbecue chicken and it was excellent. My grandson tore into the baby back ribs, he really loved them! My daughter said the pulled pork sandwich was very good also. \nWe ordered two desserts to go, the red velvet cake, and the lemon cake. My only question was why did the waitress give us the dessert menu and tell us to pick something out. And then when we did, she told us what we chose was sold out and there are only two items left! Which were the two we ended up ordering. I think that's a mistake and lazy service. But I can let it go this one time just hope they don't do it again. \nI don't like eating with plasticware, especially at these prices, but my grandson said, hey grandma, it's a rib place! So it was OK for the nine-year-old.\nFood was served on a regular oval plate, but the sides were served in Styrofoam cups which I thought was weird.\nIf you don't mind a mix of plastic and Styrofoam and real tableware then I guess you're OK with that part. For me the taste of the chicken made up for it, but it was hard to cut with a plastic knife and fork. Even though it was very tender."

A small place, located in a strip mall on the corner of DI and Durango, I thought I was in for some good barbecue, and quite possibly some great ribs!  Upon entering, I noticed a smell...not the smell of sticky/smoky barbecue, but the generic smell of all-purpose cleaner.  No biggie, I thought, at least the place was clean!  I order from the photocopied pink paper menu and was excited to see that they serve Kool-Aid as one of their beverages.  \"Now THAT's authentic!\" I thought.  I was even more excited.  I ordered the full rack of baby backs, an order of brisket, the pulled pork, fried okra, the beans, greens, and donut bread pudding. Hey, I was hungry, and I was planning on taking most of it home!\n\nWhat a disappointment.  The ribs were NOT barbecued.  It had no smoke flavor and no smoke ring.  Ditto on the brisket.  Ditto on the pulled pork.  Yes, all the meat was tender, but tasted like boiled meat slathered in sauce.  The beans were...well, beans.  The greens were almost too salty to eat.  The donut bread pudding was crusty and stale around the edges and tasted like it was a couple days old.  The best thing I had there was the fried okra and the Kool-Aid.\n\nThe employees are cheerfully nice, restrooms were immaculate, and the food was edible but not enjoyable.  I will never willingly go back.  If I am forced, I will just get the fried okra and Kool-Aid.  But don't let my strong opinion stop you from trying it out yourself.  You just might like it there, as my friend does.  But, before you consider going to T. C.'s Rib Crib, I would recommend you consider the following:\n\n-Do you love the flavor and tenderness of meats that have been slowly smoked for hours at low temperatures?  If so, don't go to T. C.'s Rib Crib!\n\n-Do you like your \"barbecue\" to taste like it was made by boiling and/or pressure cooking the meat until tender, slathering barbeque sauce over it, and slapping it on the grill a few times to caramelize the sauce?  If so, by all means go to T. C.'s Rib Crib and have a blast!"

I had to throw away a good portion of the meal because I just didn't like it.\n\nI really can't go into detail every single thing that was wrong, none of it was just cooked well.  And I agree with many that it is overpriced considering the quality of the food.  This includes - pulled pork, spare ribs, beans, and the BBQ sauce in general was just all wrong.\n\nOne exception was the beef ribs, and if someone hog tied me and forced me to eat here again this is the only thing I would order.  It's the reason why I'm giving two stars instead of one."

Went there for the 2-for-1 $4.99 Tuesday lunch special (dine-in only). Since I was alone, I still wanted to take advantage of the deal and ordered the rib tips with fries and chicken leg with mac and cheese. The rib tips were so-so and the fries ordered extra-crispy was done to my preference. The chicken leg was tender and juicy while my favorite side dish, mac and cheese, was done to prefection. The mac was made witha white cheese sauce with the cheddar cheese sprinkled on top and baked to a cripsy golden brown. I am in Mac Heaven here! For $4.99 with leftovers, I can have home cookin' for less than what I would pay at McDs. Will be back for more mac and cheese."

Because we wanted to try several things, we just ordered the family special to get four meats & three sides with the intention of taking home the leftovers for another meal. We choose brisket, chicken, ribs & rib tips. For sides we chose potato salad, baked beans, & fried okra. You already get French fries with the family deal. The cook came out & asked what kind of ribs we wanted & we ordered baby backs. We were there early & the potato salad wasn't ready yet, so we changed to Mac & cheese. I was also delighted to find sweet tea on the menu. We had almost a whole table of food when our order came. The rib tips were the best I have EVER had! They were meaty & a little crunchy around the edges. The ribs were superb! The chicken was smoky good. Our only complaint was that the brisket was a little chewy for our taste. All of the sides were excellent....the fried okra was to die for. The Mac & cheese was world class! Oh yeah, the potato salad was made while we were eating & the cook sent out a small container to our table. It was exactly to my taste & I am kind if picky about potato salad. I found out the owner is from Baton Rouge & I just happened to be wearing my LSU Tigers sweatshirt. :) The service was good with tea glasses being refilled. We will definitely be back! We have finally found *real* Southern BBQ in Vegas!!!"

As a family of 3 we usually do a 3 combo meal (2 orders of spare ribs and 1 order beef brisket and the 2 sides baked beans and potato salad). Never fails that the spare ribs are always soft and easily fall off the bone.  The meat is so tender and flavorful perfect for me.  My husband and son love sauce and will usually add more barbecue or hot sauce for themselves. The beef brisket is always tender and never chewy where you can't get it down. This usually fills us up,  if we have a bigger appetite we might order more beef brisket or the barbecue chicken.  Sometimes they have special sides like the dirty rice which my family love. We usually visit on Sundays for some barbecue and Ricky is always there to help take care of us."

We were going because a co-worker of my wife suggested it. Please BEWARE though that the address on some of these sites is WRONG and if you go to the OLD location there's nothing there! It took us 15 mins and we had to find that out the hard way.\n\nWe ordered the following:\nMac-n-cheese: GREAT! Their own recipe and it was awesome! It's really hard to find homemade macaroni and they BY FAR have THE BEST! And this is coming from people who have had mac a hundred different ways!\n\nMild Links: I can't remember which MEAT it was, but different meats have different heat factors, chicken being the most mild, so it had to have been pork or beef. Anyway, they were GREAT also as compared to other links from other places. VERY FILLING too!\n\nBeef Brisket: Not the best. The BEST I've had would be at Famous Dave's BBQ. But this place would be 2nd best and I've had it at several places. Very tasty and filling.\n\nBaked Beans: Good, but nothing to write home about.\n\nCornbread: Good, but nothing to write home about. Rather small compared to what other places give you. This was a small sweet muffin style\n\nMini-Burgers: My daughter had this, it looked filling but she still said she was hungry afterwards. Keep in mind she's a very hungry girl.\n\nDonut Style Bread Pudding: The most disappointing of all because it can't REALLY be considered bread pudding. I love bread pudding so I know what GOOD bread pudding is. Famous Dave's has the #1 BEST, Green Valley Ranch Buffet has the 2nd best. This place literally gives you a itty bitty little plastic thing with some weird bread stuff covered in that thick nasty white goo you see on top of honey buns from 7-11. And that's EXACTLY what it tasted like, a 7-11 Honey Bun. What was more disturbing was it was prepackaged and the waitress asked me if I wanted it heated up, meaning it was put in a microwave. NOT GOOD. They should SERIOUSLY not even offer bread pudding if it isn't home made. What a shame.\n\nSweet Tea: Good, one of few places that have it and it was LIPTON sweet tea. Just like I grew up on and make at home. But I would expect an AUTHENTIC soul food restaurant to have something more special. The amount (as far as cup size) was so much that I never needed a refill so that was good too.\n\nOne weird thing to complain about... While my KIDS were there, 2 white bikers came in and sat down to eat and they were cussing really loud the entire time. Usually I wouldn't mind because they are adults and they can do what they want. I even cuss in front of my kids at home and they know THEY aren't allowed to do the same. But the fact that those guys would cuss loudly in a restaurant with kids seemed rude, obnoxious, and ill-mannered. Not the restaurants fault but I didn't see any of the employee's responding to the situation. If I were the owner or manager I would have NICELY reminded them that \"This is a business and a family establishment\" and asked them to please stopp cursing because of the kids."

What in the world is this it the worst BBQ we ever had and my boys eat anything.

If I didn't live so far from this place I would have drove back and got my money back plus my five dollar tip I gave. The beef ribs was so rubbery it snap back like a rubber band when i bit into it.very very disappointed.and there goes the sides wow the bake beans only thing was decent you could tell they made it from pork n beans and some molasses and BBQ sauce to give it a nicer taste.the greens oh!!! No\" I'm from the south and I never taste greens so sweet it had a hint of sugar in it wow who does that,and the mac n cheese so over cook and glumpy .the yams was over cook and so sweet u could barely eat it but my 8yr son ate it and i swear within 3mins after he ate it he shot to the bathroom to relieve what ran through him. Corn bread was bland and dry potato salad way to much miracle whip in it and the potatoes was slightly hard ,cold slaw was ok and the two dessert we got was the lemon cake and the Carmel cake I told my wife it was room temperature stuck in a see through glass case with no temperature gauge on it when she put it in the bag the frosting was all over the paper plate.so ppl who coming far away to eat at this place please take time to review other comments to see if it worth it trust me you won't be happy if you eat here beware what you eat real talk a good BBQ place has a smoker or a grill in the back this one doesn't u do the math.

It was perfectly sweet, the whipped cream frosting was great combined with the pecans on top of the pineapple upside down cake. They used chunks of pineapple, not rings, which I liked a lot.

The brisket had a oozing puddle of that red-orange grease you may see when you reheat fatty or greasy pieces of meat, like next day breakfast sausage and/or bacon. \n\nThe ribs were so dark and over charred. As stated earlier they too looked like a old batch from the previous day. They weren't tender by a long shot.\n\nThe only comment of flavor I can give towards them was that neither had flavor and both had to be drowned in BBQ sauce. The overly sweet sauce that could have easily been out the bottle with a couple extra seasonings mixed in. \n\nThe mac and cheese and cole-slaw I got as my sides were so generic and unremarkable. It was recommended by my server  to get their peach cobbler to round out my groupon. Straight out the can peaches with too much cinnamon. At least I could tell the crust used was home made.

Obviously the sort of place willing to cut corners as condiments include Aunt Jemima and 'honey' cut with glucose syrup and starch it was in a wide selection of meats, sides, and sweets that I invested and although costs were quite low for most items, so too was the quality - the ribs clearly parboiled without a note of smoke while thinly sliced brisket and pulled pork were nearly indistinguishable beneath artificially saccharine sauce.  Mostly ignoring bland elbow noodles from which I consumed only a few bites and fries that arrived almost at meal's end as well as the $4.50 French Toast was flat and flavorless even with the $1.50 banana and whipped cream upgrade...the latter not supplied as they were apparently 'out'...and moving on to dessert, suffice it to say that the boxed vanilla pudding with only a hint of banana beneath 'nilla wafers is not worth $5.99 and although the frosting on a tiny sliver of red velvet cake was tangy and smooth the cake was so dry it literally crumbled to fork pressure - the majority of it joining nearly half the rest of my order in a waste basket when servers were otherwise occupied so as not to offend.\n\nLiterally the only patron present just past noon on a Saturday it is shocking to me that a business like TC's can sustain and as much as I try to support locals I cannot fathom a reason to return, particularly given a pricepoint higher than Rollin' Smoke despite quality on par with Famous Dave's."

The pulled pork was disappointing.  Not good quality meat.  Flavors not amusing.  The cornbread, though it was a single corn muffin, was good, moist, and fluffy.  \n\nThe 2 sides were greens and sweet potato fries.  The greens were the best thing in the entire order.  Not soggy, flavorful, cooked with bacon and spiced.  The sweet potato fries actually were soggy, limp, and therefore unappetizing.  \n\nWe also ordered a meatless platter which includes your choice of 3 sides.  We doubled up on the greens, luckily.  We ordered baked beans, which were yummy, and mac n' cheese which was alright except for the piece of paper I bit in to....wow.  \n\nFor dessert we had the peach cobbler, which was so bad, we decided as soon as we return home, to make one ourselves as a redemption.  It was made with canned peaches, and the cobbler part was a cinnamon and flour mass that was undercooked.  Made my tummy hurt. \n\nThe amount of food could've fed 3 people comfortably.

Most of the reviews were decent on TC's so I figured it was close enough to work to go check it out.\n\nI took some co-workers to go with.\n\nI had the 3 meat platter with chicken (dark meat), pulled pork and baby back ribs.  Side of slaw and mac and cheese.\n\nPulled pork was great, so was the chicken. \n\nRibs were greatly lacking, and since their name is \"Rib Crib\", I expected better.  They were a bit tough to start with and didn't just tear apart with ease like you'd expect.  The flavor was great until I had some charred meat from the underside of the ribs where they obviously reheated on a grill.  All I could taste was burnt charcoal.\n\nMac and cheese had decent flavor and it was nice to have it super cheesy but it was incredibly greasy, so that's the drawback of that side.\n\nSlaw was typical slaw, nothing to write home about.\n\nTwo people at the table had pulled pork sandwiches and they loved those.  Another person had rib tips and actually really enjoyed those but he said they weren't the best he's had by far.  The last person at the table also had the 3 meat combo and had rib tips, baby backs and brisket.\n\nHe said he wasn't a fan of the brisket, the rib tips decent, but the most awful part of his meal were the baby backs.  They ended up being tougher than mine, harder to eat and very dry.  Also had the nasty blacked char on one side.\n\nHe did in fact love his sides, dirty rice and baked beans.\n\nOtherwise the service was great, super friendly and very attentive.  Refills on drinks overflowed and it definitely made up for the quality of SOME of the food.  I'd definitely go back but not for ribs, and that's the most disappointing part.\n\nI bought the Yelp deal, the 10 for 20 dollar deal.  If it's available, get it yourself and then try the 3 meat combo yourself.  Definitely the way to go if you want to sample all the choices since it's roughly 17.99 on it's own.

In it it said there was a $4.99 lunch special: a Jr. Sammie and a side, can't beat that! SO off I went, walking distance from my work, and FINALLY decided to try this \"World Famous\" BBQ.\n\nWhen I walked into this establishment on a lovely Saturday afternoon I realized, UGH!

Whoo-wee. I don't even like jalapenos, but I just HAD to try these.\n\nMy fellow diner ordered the brisket sammie and the sweet potato fries that everyone raves about.\n\nWe had them both \"home style,\" which meant it had some really good slaw on top.\nThe verdict:\nMy sammie: s'mazin'. I really enjoyed the sandwich and wouldn't mind coming back for the lunch meal and ordering the Jr. as this sammie is pretty filling.\n\nThe OTHER sammie: Not nearly as good as mine, it was a little tougher and less flavorful. \n\nI wouldn't have the sammies without the slaw, I believe it cost an extra 50 cents, but it's worth it.\n\nThe jalapenos: These little babies were pretty darn good. I wouldn't order them again though, jalapenos just aren't my thing.\n\nSweet potato fries: Ok, what's up with these? Everyone LOVES them....I think they tasted like straight oil and were a little under cooked, and old. Poo.\n\nOver all, it was A-OK. I would totally return for the lunch menu...but that's probably it...Oh and to try the ribs....with a name like The Rib Crib...you just gotta try them...."

Well the service was slow slow slow, the order was wrong on the first few attempts by the two young servers who apparently were not communicating with each other, and when we finally got all the overpriced food we ordered, it was mediocre to bad.\n\nThe final insult was when the 16-year-old girl running the place ripped us off.  She refused to accept the full amount of our $14 Groupon, claiming that because we had ordered one of the \"daily specials\", that she could only give us a $10 credit instead of the full $14 face amount.  Apparently she was well-trained at a young age to steal form the customers, because when I objected and tried to explain to her that she was violating the Groupon policy by not honoring the full amount of the Groupon,  she claimed that's how she did it for \"all Groupon customers\".  I guess I was the first one to speak up.\n\nI asked to talk to the owner, but the girl said that she could not reach him.  So we took back the $4 tip we were going to leave and broke even, but left with a bad taste in our mouths, both literally and figuratively!\n\nOur suggestion:  DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT EATING AT THIS AWFUL PLACE!!!  Head to Famous Dave's BBQ instead-- cheaper, with much better food, service, and atmosphere!"

I thought the price was reasonable, we ordered the family platter, and you get so much  food for 45 could easily feed 4-5 people maybe even six. The sweet ice tea is really sweet, and you can tell its homemade, so it tasted that much better to me. My husband liked his brisket thinly sliced so it's a matter of preference, their brisket is sliced thin.  The service staff was friendly and perfect. I probably won't come in the restaurant to eat again, but I will definitely order for pick up because all that food you really need to lay down or kick back on a couch. We tried the pork links, baby back ribs, pulled pork and BBQ brisket with sides of fried okra, macaroni and cheese, SAMs baked beans and collard greens and the meal also came with 4 corn breads which were soft and\nMoist... I saw a review that said they were\nDry and I didn't think the corn muffins were dry at all, it could of been just one of\nThose off  days but I felt all food was homemade.... We have a lot of left overs, and I will be getting this again and when I have family or friends over this would be great dish to bring home for some grub.. Especially for Those who like eating BBQ and BBQ sauce on there food."

I thought it was gonna be enough for the 3 of us.  When the food came out i thought it was a joke or something.  I was like, where is the rest of our food!!!??   The servings are ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!   I had to order an extra lunch special.   My 2 year old ate the super tiny quarter leg almost whole.   And my riblets were just so tiny  there was hardly any meat on them.  On top of that the food came out cold... What a BIG letdown!!   I will never go back.  I really don't understand all the hype about this place.  Maybe we went on the wrong day and time.   If you want good BBQ try H&H BBQ in NLV.

A little pricey at $8 but the size was decent, as was the flavor. But the texture was bordering on mushy. I prefer the fuller, meatier quality of the pulled pork at Buzz BBQ. The bun was nicely toasted giving the sandwich an extra crunch and the fries weren't bad.\n\nI do like the fact that they have lunch specials and daily dessert specials.

We are used to slow smoked brisket and this looked and tasted like a rump roast that was cooked like a rump roast and sliced thin and had sauce dumped on it.  DH liked the potato salad. I swear the sweet potato fries (which are a staple in our house) were the frozen ones we buy at the grocers so, yep, they did taste just like home-made :)  The sauce is nothing spectacular - we are used to restaurants that have their own signature sauce but I didn't think there was anything spectacular about their sauce either.

The ribs did fall off the bone but felt like they had been microwaved to heat them up. The chicken was dry and overcooked. You know how when chicken sits too long it gets a little translucent?  The pot sausage was VERY salty, but it was tasty. The mac and cheese was good once I put salt on it. Maybe they can take the pork links and mix them into the mac and cheese?  The coleslaw wasn't that good. Not much flavor and it looks like it may have started to freeze. The top layer of the cabbage was translucent as well. Not to mention it took nearly 25 min to get my food once it was ordered and I wasn't the only one that was waiting. There was a party of 10 that seemed to be getting a lot of attention from the staff at the detriment of everyone else. I wish these guys luck, but the most consistent places in town to get ribs are Lucilles, Roma's, and Applebees, in that order."

The service is always great, and the food is mind blowing! The muddy water is really good, but we usually end up drowning ourselves in the best kool-aid ever known to man. What I love most about this place is that its not selective. What I mean is that its not \"oh the ribs are great, but this/that isn't. EVERYTHING at TC's is delicious! From the mac & cheese to the ribs/sauce...I couldn't drool more. Make sure to use the Yelp deal!"

My husband had the brisket sandwich and was very pleased.   Next trip, I'm trying the ribs.  Everything tasted fresh and homemade.  The portions are also generous.\n The restaurant is clean and everyone was very friendly. It's nice to walk into a restaurant and feel comfortable and welcome for a change. It's a refreshing change from the chains and franchises, it's a family business, so it's a labor of love. (The reason that you don't have the pleasure of a smoky BBQ aroma is that they have to smoke their meats off site, since there is no room at their location for a smoker.) My husband and I are from Kansas City and we know we are BBQ snobs.  We had just about given up hope of ever finding really good BBQ here in Vegas until this evening.  We love everything about T.C's and definitely will be going back."

The greens were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The pulled pork was amazingly moist. The sauce was spot on! Not to sweet, not too hot. The ribs were like home made. I notice that ribs in chain restaurants have a weird texture... chemical brining? I read someone else's review complaining about the texture of the ribs and that they were charred. I disagree. I think they are plenty tender and meaty and yes, charred in a few places...they WERE near fire. (sarcasm) The fried okra was good, fries (sweet and regular) were good. The waitresses were fun and friendly. If you are a chain restaurant lover, maybe this isn't the place for you."

Arriving at the location i was surprised at what little it really was inside upon entering as it was really like an indoor picnic very no frills and humble about the decor. We sat and ordered a 2 meat combo links/ pulled pork with 2 sides mac & cheese/ greens and cornbread for $15. And then the Rib tips and 2 sides mac & cheese/ potato salad and corn bread for $10. I was not impressed to say the least as the links were very mushy and not a solid put together product, the rib tips were sparse on the meat side and the sides... lordy the mac & cheese was dry and almost chalky with my only taking 1 bite of potato salad as it had too much built up condensation in the container from being stored in the fridge for too long. The best part of the meal was the pulled pork, where if you want to try this place i recommend doing the pulled items turkey, pork, chicken and bread to make a sandwich. The BBQ sauce like others mentioned is a brown sugar based sauce which i dont mind but if you dont like sweet sauce then this might not be for you. All in all it was a meal yes and the portions were decent but the quality of taste and product i just wasnt feeling at all. For the money i think i would have rather gone elsewhere to dine. BBQ is so touchy with alot of people and im not spoiled but i do have some expectations when i go for a meal in this arena."

Then the day before the event was to happen he called and stated he was driving that he would pull over and call me back in about ten minutes.  The event has come and gone and still never received a call back.  We were regular customers, loved the food and even referred many.  Customer service is huge in my book - your customers are what keeps the business running.  Sadly we will not be returning due to this fact and will no longer refer our friends and family.

Their regular menu and breakfast menu elicits BBQ legitimacy, with Chicken, Ribs (spare ribs, baby backs & beef ribs), rib tips, and pull pork (any of these meats available in their omelets).\n\nThis being my first dining experience at TC's, I had to go with the three meat combo with 2 sides and cornbread in order to get a good feel of their BBQ.  My choices: Rib Tips, Baby Back Ribs, & Pulled Pork; Mac 'n' cheese & Fried Cabbage.\n\nTo my understanding, this is a family owned and run business and it showed from the extremely friendly and personable service to some of the family members playing a board game in the dining room because it was slow.\n\nThe rib tips were excellent as was the fried cabbage.  The pull pork was serviceable after adding a little more BBQ sauce.  The ribs however were dry and extremely charred.  TC's BBQ sauce is extremely sweet and lacking any kind of spice, but because that's not my cup of tea doesn't mean you won't like it.  The mac 'n' cheese was gritty and somewhat less than warm and the cornbread could definitely be categorized as stale.\n\nAll-in-all, I've rated TC's with three stars based on the service, \"BBQ restaurant\" feel, and my craving to have more rib tips and fried cabbage.  As for rating a \"Rib Crib\" for their Ribs, well that would be thumbs down."

I wouldn't have gone back without my discount.\n\nThe meat here is of such low quality, it's embarrassing. The pulled pork was so shredded that it nearly looked ground and the only flavor came from the sauce. Ribs were mediocre, and for a place named after their ribs this is unacceptable- low quality, not particularly meaty or flavorful, and a bit too charred.\n\nThe brisket though. As a Texas girl, I know brisket about as well as I know my own grandmother. And I don't know what the hell they're serving here. Meat is not fresh and is cut so thinly that it appears to be prepackaged. Little to no flavor, this is not brisket. I was so, so disappointed.\n\nWe left more than half of our food on our plates, paid, and left. Owner was half asleep in a booth at the back of the dining room and did not address us at all, despite being the only customers and clearly having an issue with their product.\n\nDon't go here- they don't care about their customers or their product.

The woman behind the cash register was very patient and helped me pick out to go orders that would give the best sample of their barbe que  rib selections.  She even gave me a sample of something I was not ordering, the pulled pork Sammie ....yum!\nWhen I was in the car going home the smell of the ribs  was so overwhelming I had to pull over into a parking lot and tear one off the rack!  Being from Texas I am critical about the meat being smoky with flavor and the sauce is for dipping.  It was Texas perfect!  Most important was the staff..they were Texas friendly..though I was the only one from the lone star state.  Welcome. Home"

Will never return with their ghetto service, cheap meats, and manipulative advertising."

We weren't yet aware that dine-in folks were seated so we stood for a bit until we caught on. \n\nThe room smelled great. The walls were decorated with photos, articles, and art pieces that made the space comfortable and reflected the family ownership. The rest of the space is straightforward with seats, which I appreciate in a BBQ place. I don't know why, but overly decorated BBQ places are weird to me. Sidenote: the UCLA sticker in the window was not lost on us recent transplants from Los Angeles and Bruin alumni. \n\nAnyway, our server welcomed us and got our drinks. I don't know what it is with this city but, as usual, the refillable fountain drinks were Pepsi. However, it was nice to know that Coke products were available in cans (just not refillable). Being a human camel, I went with the refillable stuff. \n\nWhen we ordered, our server asked if we'd been in before and we said no. She very genuinely and excitedly welcome us and expressed her happiness about our first visit. That didn't go unnoticed. It was really sweet. \n\nIt being Friday and me loving fish, I already knew I was ordering the daily special of fried catfish. I went with the 3 piece meal with two sides - fried okra and mac and cheese - with cornbread. \n\nLet me just say that the catfish was so on point that my husband and I ate the entire portion despite my promises to myself to save half for later. The fish was perfectly fried and seasoned; crisp and clean and in no way greasy or fishy. As I mentioned, we recently moved from LA. Our old apartment out there was close to many soul food options and this catfish was on par with many of our favorites. My heart was happy from this dish. \n\nThe fried okra was also well cooked. I think it missed a sauce but the hot sauce at the table worked well. \n\nThe mac and cheese was cheesy and thick though a tab bit on the colder side. Still, despite the temperature, it was a solid accompaniment to the entire shared meal. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rVzUDPH_6vUEQOFuNBIovQ&userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA\n\nMy husband, and rib lover and pork enthusiast, went with the three-meat plate and upgraded to all the ribs available: 1/4 slab pork spare ribs, 1/4 rack pork baby back ribs, and 1/4 rack beef ribs. He selected greens and fries for his sides. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ZNYVsrPOUg0n91NhzKZv5w&userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=znzhMgybO7TFHvg0VV4agQ&userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA\n\nWe're both from pork loving cultures and the ribs did not disappoint. They all had a lovely smokiness and tenderness. I usually favor pork ribs but, in this instance, I felt the beef ribs were the most outstanding. My husband  favored the baby back ribs. \n\nBeing greedy, we tacked on an order of brisket . Also, Friday nights are usually cheat and date nights. Just saying. Don't judge. I'm capable of eating even more. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gms7IFEgYRSA-HioCsyGmg&userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA\n\nI was surprised at the thin slices of the brisket but I rather enjoyed it. It reminds me of Korean BBQ brisket, but with soul. It was fantastic stuffed into the accompanying cornbread. \n\nI felt the service was very attentive. We were checked in on just enough to feel catered to without feeling suffocated and I had no trouble getting refills. We had a few hiccups on the food (had to ask for the cornbread and brisket after everything else came out)  but that didn't really bother us. Actually, it made us laugh about how overzealous our order was. However, I will say I was disappointed we weren't offered dessert. I forgot what was on the menu but I probably would have gladly ordered something. \n\nThe tab came out to $48 for 2 drinks, 3-meat all rib plate, catfish, 4 sides, and brisket a la carte. With the Yelp deal, that dropped down to $27. Tip and the original $10 to buy the deal brought the total back to $47, which I think was absolutely fair even without the deal. \n\nThat all being said, I think 3.5-3.75 stars is on point and we look forward to returning soon. If I recall correctly, my husband plans on a full rack next time (I assume baby backs). If, for some reason I find myself off from work on a weekday, I will beeline here to check out the $4.99 lunch deals!"

            "review": "The brisket was a bit too apple cidery vinegary and sliced super-thin, which isn't the flavor nor texture I typically expect from brisket.  The baby-baby ribs were TOUGH, which is DEFINITELY not what I expect from baby back ribs!\n  The sides were the best things there: dirty rice had a nice rue to it, black-eyed peas were spot-on, mac and cheese was wonderfully cheesy, the baked beans were the perfect balance of smoke and sweet.  The corn bread, however, disappointed and seemed like it was made straight from a powder you'd buy at a store.  Overall, though, the portions are well-proportioned, so you get a good bang for your buck, especially if you use the Yelp discount special.\n  Another small thing that happened that kinda put me off a little was how they served the food: the waitress brought it out, one dish at a time, with significant time differences between the plates.  So two people in our party got their food...followed by another person getting their food....and then another.....and then the final person got theirs even later than the others.  A little protocol training on consistent table service would go a LONG way, when it comes to lunch service.\n  So, overall, not impressed with the service nor the food, and not anticipating a return trip."

One had been here prior, but it was the first visit for the rest of us. The chicken and waffles was the special for the day, which meant I got an extra waffle with my meal. The chicken wings had a crispy skin and the meat was very juicy. The waffles were okay. Nothing out of the ordinary. I also added the dessert for $1, which was peach cobbler that day.\n\nDefinitely a place I would return to. Our server mentioned that I have to try the ribs next time.

First off they payed full attention to my little toddler making sure she was happy coloring and enjoying some of their wonderful tea while we waited for our food. This always makes me happy when I have help to keep my a.d.d. toddler happy :-) What also delights me is when the waitress and host is young, friendly, polite and just over all a good person. You get that sense right away with these people. Very attentive to us and not on their phones checking facebook ;-) \n\nThe food was yummy!! We got the pulled pork sammie (flipping awesome!) Beef Brisket sammie (another winner) Some smack yo mama its that good Mac and cheese, delish sweet potato fries and for the little girl a wonderful chicken leg, baked beans and we all had the cherry cobbler to share. By the end of the meal I could barely move...yet I still had a bunch to bring home :-) I was in a euphoric  yet almost comatose state as I walked out of there.\n\nBottom line is they made me a fan :-) I was won over right away with their kindness and the food sealed the deal ;-)"

We got beef tips, hot links, 1/4 slab spare ribs with sweet potato fries and collard greens as the sides. \n\nThe hot links could have been a bit more tender, but were delicious on the other hand. Beef tips tasted good, even though they were essentially small steak pieces. LOVED the ribs, they were tender and practically fell off the bone. The collard greens were quite tasty and the sweet potato fries had a perfect ratio of sweetness and typical french fry flavor. \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty interesting. It's slightly hole in the wall-ish but clean. I loved the pictures on the wall, it gave the place a VERY homey feel, the service is pretty homey as well. Another nice thing to note are the names of many of the dishes, which are supposedly named after members of TC's family. \n\nAs for the glazed donut bread pudding, tasty, but WAY TOO SWEET.

There aren't table cloths, but you can dine in. \n\nIn addition to drool-worthy, fresh fried okra, I had sweet potato fries and a quarter chicken. The fries were not as impressive as the okra, but my husband inhaled them in less than a minute. As for the chicken, I could literally pick it up, and the bones would fall out, which means that this was one tender piece of chicken. Tender and flavorful- what more could you want from a chicken? Well, it could have been a bit juicier, and I did miss not having a spicy BBQ sauce. However, the standard sauce had a savory sweetness and was nothing to complain about!\n\nThe service was super sweet too.\n\nThe prices may be a tad more than you anticipate, but you're paying extra for the soul. I will be back, and I may even show up just for an okra snack. (It's the equivalent of a Scooby Snack for me...)"

Hunks of meat. Baby back ribs, dried up, BBQ sauce on the side. The meat is succulent enough and flavored to a satisfying point of delight. Tender and falls right off the bone. Same goes for their BBQ chicken. Golly, that is one BIG CHICKEN, I kid you not. I don't know what they have in the back of the kitchen, but half a chicken was gigantic.

Again, we used our entertainment book coupon to save $15 so why not splurge and order more than we should. We get to the place and its on the smaller side. There's about 12 tables and thats about it. I heard if you order to go, its gonna be like a fast food place experience... But if you dine in, they promptly seat you, bring you table settings, and give you the full service you would expect from a nicer restaurant. We get there around 5pm on a Saturday and almost all the tables were full. I take that as a good sign. We get the menus and start looking over the choices. Meats meats meats was the name of the game. I ordered the Lot's O' Meat Meal ($18.00) which comes with 3 meats, 2 sides, and a corn bread. The meats to choose from were: beef tips, pulled pork, beef brisket, links (2), 1/4 rib slab, 1/4 chicken. The sides to choose from were: Grandma Georgia's Macaroni and Cheese, Aunt Ada's Potato Salad, Big Sam's Baked Beans, Cousin Joe's Greens, Uncle Earl's Coleslaw, Regular Fries, Onion Rings, Fried Jalapenos, Wedge Cut Fries, Fried Okra, Sweet Potato French Fries. Wowzers, thats alot!\n\nSo for my meats I get the beef brisket, hot links, and 1/4 rib slab. The rib slab was a choice of baby back, beef, or spare ribs. I got the baby back ribs. My sides were Grandma Georgia's Mac and Cheese and Onion Rings. My friend ordered the full rack of baby back ribs ($18.00) which also came with 2 sides and a corn bread. Her sides were Sweet Potato French Fries, YUM!, and Wedge Cut Fries.\n\nMan was the food tasty. The meats were tender and super flavorful and the sides were huge. The best part is that I ordered a small fountain drink (sm $1.49 lg $2.49) since it was all you can drink and the waitress brings me a large 32 oz drink. I was like \"I ordered the small\" and she replied \"That is the small.\" Wow. I guess the large is a 44+ oz size then.\n\nThe $15 coupon definitely paid off and the food was really really good. I would definitely go back to this place. This was way better than Memphis Championship BBQ."

Large portions of freshly cooked great tasting southern/soul food.   For those from the south this is a taste of home.\n\nA tip... order your Kool-Aid by Color!  \"I'd like purple please!\" and don't be afraid to ask what colors they have today.  On one visit they had green (lime). (warning: don't order if you are diabetic.   This is the full sugar kind of kool-aid)"

We ordered the brisket and pulled pork the first time and I changed mine from pulled pork to the two meat platter the second time and chose the baby back ribs and quarter chicken. Anxiously awaiting its arrival but I have absolute faith it will be fantastic. As for sides. The salad was on point. The mac and cheese incredible and the potato salad...about average... but for vegas restaurants I've been to, that is amazing. I can only hope the next people that go here are as amazed as I was. Keep it up TCs!"

There was no breakfast menu even though they are open for it? Not a big deal, but wanted to try a new breakfast joint.\n\nService was a bit slow for being an empty restaurant, but we were not in a hurry so it was not the end of the world.\n\nOrdered a 3 meal combo & a cheeseburger.\n\nLet me say the sweet tea might have been some of the worst ever. I personally despise Lipton & GMO tea. I always felt a sweet tea would come from a brand maybe made or big in the South? Maybe a better brand? \n\nThe meal came... the cole slaw & mac & cheese were our sides. I will say this was some pretty great mac & cheese. The cole slaw was blended perfectly as well. The sides were better than our meats (brisket, pulled chicken, & rib tips).\n\nWhether it was the brisket or the pulled chicken, something had a weird aftertaste to it. Not sure if it was the sauce or freezer burn. \n\nCheeseburger was nothing special. Just a frozen patty fired up. Some meat probably purchased from Sysco Foods. A shame because a ground burger from Brisket would have been totally better. \n\nThis is one of those rare moments where I felt bad for the struggling business. If I could nominate them for Restaurant:Impossible, I would. The decor is so nice and inviting to just have a dud in food."

It was alright. \n\nUnfortantly, when I left the restaurant I left my cell phone behind. Not 15 minutes later did I realize this. We called the store and the manager claimed it wasn't there. We went to the store and there was no phone. The female told me no one had been in the store since I left but she didnt have it. I asked to speak to a different manager and se said I couldn't. She said the owner doesn't allow customers to call her. I left an alternative number to be reached on. No call. On Monday night my phone text my friend saying someone at rib crib had it and to come get it. I went Tuesday when they opened to get it. My phone was returned minus my $37 dollar case. The owner was nice and offered me a free meal. However I nor will\nI allow anyone else I know to return to this restaurant. There is just something not right about a waitress stealing your phone."

Didn't think much of it, the service (at the beginning) seemed on top of it but once she placed our food down we never saw her again! Everyones drink was empty and I had to call a different waitress to get us the bill.. \n\nLet's talk about the food. I had pull pork sandwich with sweet potato fries I can say it was good (8.99). My husband had brisket and it was horrible! It tasted like lunch meat and was just smothered in this sour BBQ sauce... (recommendation- smoke your brisket) it was 12.99 and the portion was so small. (not worth it) My daughter had two beef ribs that didn't even have enough meat on it AND was too spicy for a 6 yr old to eat! I tasted it and couldn't eat it. Why would they put that on the kids menu and not specify that their BBQ sauce is spicy?! \n\nWe obviously couldn't tell our concern to our waitress because we never saw her again! This place is ridiculous and I wouldn't recommend it at all!!"

            "review": "So this restaurant met all of my expectations, and I left very full and happy. As someone who's spent most of their life in Oakland and LA, I have been looking for some soul food bbq for a while now in Las Vegas. And I want to be very clear about it being SOUL FOOD bbq. It's the kind of bbq that your uncle cooks at the family picnic. Nothing exceptionally spectacular, just pretty good bbq. It's obviously not going to win any Food Network World Champion BBQ competitions, but it was cooked well (the pork on my ribs literally just slipped off the bone) and has good sauce. \n\nThe sides were also good. I got the mac and cheese and greens, which were far superior to what I was served at M&M's. The mac and cheese was perfectly seasoned (I only added a little bit of pepper, which I do to everything as almost a tick), and the greens were the perfect mix of sweet and salty. Most meals also come with a cornbread muffin, which was ok. I personally prefer slices of white bread with my bbq, so I'll consider asking for that next time I come. They also have all the best soul food drinks (Kool-Aid, Sweet Tea, Muddy Water), and come in a massive cup for like $2. My red Kool-Aid was literally served to me in the biggest cup I have ever received.\n\nThe atmosphere was typical of soul food restaurant: family photos on the wall, R&B music playing, those slippery booths they also have at Subways. The dinnerware were those hard plastic ones, and the utensils were disposable plastic ones. I wasn't mildly surprised by any of this, because, once again this was typical of SOUL FOOD BBQ restaurant. I've been to bbq restaurants that literally have three tables, and give your your food in Styrofoam containers regardless of whether you're taking it to go. \n\nThe only thing that I found a bit unfavorable was that I thought it was a bit pricey for what your got. My 1/4 rib meal cost $11, and only came with one side (I split the other with my friend). That being said, I rarely leave a Vegas restaurant under $10, so I wasn't too surprised. \n\nAll in all, TC's Rib Crib is pretty good soul food bbq spot, and I'll definitely be back."

I always slow down looking at the sign as if it would magically change. $4.99 has to be a really good deal for BBQ so to save some bucks I wanted to go during lunch. Passed by on a Saturday, like clock work I see the sign, slow down, read the sign, and check the clock.  Almost continued on as usually but it was lunch time so turned at the next chance.  \n\n\"Yea Im gonna get my BBQ ON!!\" Not so, no lunch special on Sat and Sun but a 2 for 1 breakfast special which was OK but I really wanted some BBQ.  Not much of a BBQ menu for breakfast, mostly omelets and waffles. Ordered the brisket omelet not my favorite I was expecting it to be covered with BBQ sauce and big chunks of brisket pieces instead there was tiny slices of brisket and not a lot of taste.  All there was on the table was hot sauce and ketchup. It was plenty filling though. Next time I'll see if they can give me some BBQ sauce.\n\nI ordered some BBQ to go. Some of their \"world famous\" BBQ ribs which tasted really good and the meat fall off the bone tender like it suppose to.  The full slab was $20 but had a $10 for $20 yelp coupon so scored.\n\nI had the craving for some brisket, hence the brisket omelet, so ordered that to. Again I was expecting thick pieces of brisket, you know something you can cut with fork.  Instead very thin slices kind of how you would eat deli meats.  It was also rubbery and chewy, not a fan of the meat but loved the sauce.\n\nServices was good, friendly and warm must have been the holiday season.  The place was decked out for the holidays, stocking hanging, xmas tree, and music playing.  It was slow there so I don't think they mined me stay there a just relaxing after I ate.  Even stole a few ribs and brisket pieces out of my containers before I left LOL. They have dessert but I had no room, menu say to ask for their $1.00 dessert of the day.  I'll probably be back for more ribs and to try more of their BBQ menu. I like all of the old photo all over the wall."

This isn't a review of the food, which is wonderful, but of the TERRIBLE service that my Dad and I experienced today.\n\nWe were both in the mood for BBQ, and having been to TC's before at the old location, we decided to check out the new place. We walked in and were greated by the waitress on duty, a young Asian woman, who promptly seated us and gave us menus. There was only one other group of people in the room, which was surprising. We sat there looking at the menu for about 10 minutes, and then she finally took our drink order. After that, she dissapeared. Another 10 minutes walked by and we got up to leave. We crossed paths with her as we were walking out and she asked if we were leaving as she had the drinks we had ordered 15 minutes prior in her hands. We said yes, and she just said, \"Okay,\" and dumped the drinks out in the sink.\n\nThis girl has to be one of the worst waitresses I have ever experienced. She obviously doesn't care at all about service, and I'm pretty sure the owners of the restaurant would be a little miffed at her for the waste of the drinks. \n\nI almost wish TC's had stayed at the old location, as it had much more of a family-oriented vibe to it...much more intimate. I'm going to give TC's another shot sometime in the future, but I think I'll call in the order and pick it up rather than face this sort of service again.\n\nIF YOU SEE THE YOUNG ASIAN WAITRESS BEHIND THE COUNTER WHEN YOU WALK IN, YOU MAY AS WELL JUST TURN AROUND AND WALK OUT. Unless you want to be ignored for a good 30 minutes, that is."
