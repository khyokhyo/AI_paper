            "review": "Overall, pretty good sushi for a reasonable AYCE price.  The fish cuts were generous and did not have too much rice.  The maguro, smelt and salmon egg, salmon, cinco de mayo roll, poke were all good choices.  The hamachi was not good, a little sour, maybe it was not a good batch.\n\nThe green tea ice cream in the end hits the spot and good way to end the meal.  The service is quick and efficient.  The location could be hard to find as it's tucked away in the back of a strip mall.\n\nRecommended if you have a big craving for sushi."

            "review": "Definitely one of the best AYCE sushi places you can find in America. The consistency on the quality that they provide on their menu as well as the variety available is quite enticing to bring back heavy eaters like my party and I even if we only have 1 hour to eat.\n\nThe trick as my group came to learn was to order as much as your heavy appetite can handle. They may warn you that any leftovers immediately becomes charged extra at ala carte price BUT if you are certain of your appetite, JUST DO IT.\n\nAnother tip is regarding the limited items (meaning one per person). I only remember two items, which I ordered both of and are fried oysters and sake shooters. Now, if some in your group doesn't like (or can't) eat either of these two BUT you can and want to, ORDER on their behalf.\n\nFavorite rolls/nigiri/sides\n1. Salmon - exceptionally fresh. BIGGER plus was when it came out as FATTY salmon. OMFG, I had to order even more.\n2. Hamachi\n3. Miso soup (practically my buffet sake)\n4. Tuna\n\nIf you like spicy, apparently, there's a roll called the 911. I gotta love our waitress that night when he dared one of my party to take the spice challenge. He looked like he was going to combust.\n\nOther notes: Last few times I visited were during dinner and although the restaurant was full, food comes out fast pretty quickly. Service is exceptional and a plus."

I enjoyed that I had the option of getting special rolls, baked rolls, hand rolls, nigiris, soups, appetizers and ice cream.\n- Special rolls are average. Fuji's in Davis is better. Too much sauce. good \"meat\" to rice ratio. \n- Salmon nigiri was subpar. seemed thin and not fresh. Hamachi was tasty. \n- Service is friendly. I asked to watch the nba conference finals, and they changed it right away \n\n:)"

One particular roll was my favorite, although I can't remember for the life of me what it was. It was baked (i think) and was wrapped in tin-foil and just tasted amazing! Anyway, I definitly ate my money's worth of sushi and highly recommend this place.  Best in town."

            "review": "On a last minute late night sushi adventure, my husband and I decided to try Sushi Mon. We've tried to come here a few months ago, but it was a 45min wait so we passed.\n\nIt was crowded at 11:00PM, we took that as a good sign. We were sat right away since most of their tables were finishing up. \n\nWe opted for the AYCE option, at about $25/PP that's a decent price for us. We started with some nigiri and apps- -  I always order ikura (salmon roe) and my husband orders amaebi (sweet shrimp). The waiter mistakenly brought me over an order of  ika (squid). Honest mistake because I do have a Jersey accent and both words sound the same. I tried it  since it was AYCE, but really didn't like it. It was really tough like old bubble gum. The ikura came out after a few minutes, and it was good, not great though. it was very briny and almost too fishy. My husband said the sweet shrimp was very tasty. The salmon, garlic tuna and green mussels were good. All cut extra thin, but we expect that from local AYCE spots. \n\nWe both tried their Spicy yellowtail handroll, it was really spicy and delicious. Not too much rice and the fish was rolled to the very bottom of the handroll. \n\nThe hurricane roll (Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado topped with salmon tempura, smelt eggs & green onion drizzled with eel sauce spicy yum yum sauce & mayonnaise) was icky. It was drowning in mayo. I didn't see that at first, so my first bite was brutal. It's $13.45 on their regular menu. That's not $13 quality. The mayo to roll ratio was overwhelming. I scrapped it all off, while the waiter watched. It was the worst part of dinner. And to think-- that's one of their \"special rolls'. yikes. \n\nThe Orion roll (Spicy tuna and cucumber wrapped with cajun albacore drizzled with garlic sauce) pretty good, not overly impressed though. The cajun seasoning was barely there and the albacore was paper thin. \n\n\nThe Tempura icecream had soggy/raw tempura around it, It wasn't cooked long enough so that resulted in a sloppy and unappetizing mess. \n\nWith sake and two AYCE the bill came out to $80. The price is good but I'm not sure if we will return. Although some was good, there are too many restaurants that exceed our expectations here in Vegas. There's no reason to settle for sub par food. I think a 3 star rating from me is fair."

My favorites: the salmon sushi, ama ebi, fried shrimp heads and pretty much everything. They do not mess around here. You can order as much as you want...as long as you eat it all. Which I always do. You can order half rolls which is great because you can try a lot of different variations. This place has now become one of my favorites."

Now, I wish I can give this place negative stars, but unfortunately, lowest I can go is 1 star.\n\nFirst off, the food is just average compare to ayce sushi restaurants in socal. I would give 3 stars just for food. What really took all the stars away from my review was their service. First round of order that we put in went okay, but our second round we had to wait 25 mins! The chef who took our order wasn't even making our food. They only had two chefs working to serve the whole restaurant, which was filling up for dinner at the time we went. I am usually a patient person, but this place just crossed the line. One of the waitresses came by to ask if we were doing okay, and I told her we've been waiting for 25 mins and all I got from her was a sad face... seriously? I wasn't expecting to get trolled by a waitress during my Vegas trip, but it happened today. So sad to see all these people going crazy over this restaurant because this place doesn't deserve any stars."

Most places would hide the fact they have fatty tuna.  \n\nI wouldn't call Sushi Mon the best sushi place out there but it is certainly top 5 in Las Vegas.  Not only for the quality of food, attention to service, but the hours!  I would hope they have everything I listed above because the prices pinch the wallet.  I don't care too much for special rolls, I've always been the rice on the bottom and fish straight up on top type of person.  And the quality of fish they serve here is fresh and good.  I had one bad experience with their uni but they replaced it with the quickness.  \n\nIf I do order special rolls, I usually order half rolls if available just so I can try other special rolls without getting full too fast."

It may have been the boiling rage I had just experienced in finding out Kan Pai no longer offers AYCE that sent me into a sushi rage. Luckily, Sushi Mon is no more than a quarter mile down the street so we decided to give it a shot.\n\nAt $26.95 this place was HOPPING. One of my main issues with this place is that it is very small and when it is busy it can become extremely cramped looking at their gigantic menus. Couple that with busy sushi chefs who only occasionally look your way and waitresses that have to be stared down for even a glass of water and I was already a bit perturbed even before trying anything.\n\nThe rolls were subpar and their special mango mesquite roll just had some funky flavors going on and I couldn't figure out if it was tasty or disgusting which is a first for me. Their nigiri menu was plentiful and tasty, and the best roll is definitely the chubby roll. I would HIGHLY advise anyone against ordering the 9-1-1 roll as it is legit painful to eat. Normally when I order the roll elsewhere it is a bit spicy but nothing compares to having to eat about half the ginger in front of you and having to guzzle 3 glasses of water and STILL having the burning sensation on your tongue. I am going to have nightmares about that roll and each of us could only muster one piece. Eater beware!"

            "review": "I'm sorry, but this place fucking sucked.  We drove nearly 45 minutes off the strip to get there, and it was a disappointment to say the least, considering how much everyone hyped it up.  It was basically full when we arrived, but there were five seats open at the bar.  We stood around for five minutes with no host or hostess telling us whether or not we could sit down or not, and it was only after we flagged down a busboy that we were told we could have a seat.  \n\nWe all ordered the all-you-can-eat lunch, and proceeded to put in our orders.  For appetizers I ordered a green salad (completely drenched in dressing with mushy tomatoes), the fried calamari (it came out square-shaped and tasted like fish cake?) and the mussels, which was the only edible selection of the lot.  \n\nFor sushi, we ordered plenty of nigiri and some rolls as well.  The pieces of fish for the nigiri weren't especially big or tasty, and definitely wasn't on par with other sushi places I've been to.  I was especially disappointed with the rolls - while there was no dearth in selection, most of the menu items seemed the same with only minor changes in the ingredients, and the ones that we did get just weren't appetizing at all - we ended up having leftover pieces of some of the rolls we ordered with no one stepping up to finish it, not because we were full but because they just tasted gross.  Overall, just boring, unremarkable flavors that weren't appetizing at all.  At the end, I was so put off by the sushi selection that I had to go back and order the mussels in order to try and fill myself up (which still didn't end up happening).  \n\nSave yourself the drive off the strip and take a pass on this place."

            "review": "Whenever I get the sushi bug, this is where I go. \n\nLet's face it. Sushi is expensive.  $2 or 3 per piece is a bit spendy IMO, but hey, that's pretty much average cost for nigiri.  And I am a hungry boy.  I am there to taste the fish, so I generally don't order rolls, much less dip my fish bits in soy sauce.  That said, I usually do all you can eat ($28-30 dinner, 1 hour), and for that price I think the quality of the fish is quite good.  \n\nFor starters, I usually get about ten pieces yellowtail (which is my fave and always good here) and 6-8 pieces garlic tuna (also snacktastic!)  That alone pays for the AYCE.   Other faves are tamago, the grilled eel (unagi), and salmon.  \n\nThey also have a nice variety of sides included on the menu, and I usually get at least  three or four things including shrimp tempura, gyoza, miso soup and sometimes a seaweed salad or ahi poki.  \n\nTo satisfy my sweet tooth, I get a green tea ice cream and a lychee sherbet, because honestly, why make tough decisions when I can have it both ways!  Sometimes a mochi too.\n\nWhen I finally put the sticks down I've generally put away about $80 worth of food.  Cuz that's how I roll.  (Get it, ha!)  Not bad for $30...\n\nI always sit at the bar and the chefs are attentive and speedy.  The waitresses, even though they are focused on waiting tables, are usually pretty good about getting your drinks, side orders, and clearing empty dishes.  \n\nThe place is kinda small, little decor and you may wait a bit on the weekends\n\nIf you are looking for the BEST sushi in town, this probably isn't the place for you.  If you need a fish fix and want to save a few clams (another ha!) I say charge it."

I was quite surprised it wasn't busy at all. They were just waiting for a larger party to finish up and we were seated in 10 mins. \n\nFirst off, I forgot how good of a quality their sushi is. I haven't been to Sushi mon in a long time since discovering Oyshi, Hikari and Island Sushi. After my first salmon nigiri, it instantly reminded me of why we always used to go here. Big, fresh piece of fish on a tiny nug of rice. Exactly how it should be.\n\nI love their salmon nigiri and their natto! Their natto is the best I've had in town.. its the kind that is from a tube.. not the ones from the packs. Don't get me wrong, I like those too.. just not for my sushi.\n\nI didn't realize that their prices went up to $30! That is pretty pricey for all you can eat sushi, when other venues offer much more of a variety. Honestly, I have been going to other places because they offer much more choices in appetizers. I'm not a sushi roll person. I don't care at all for those rolls stuffed and topped with random stuff. I mainly stick to the nigiris and explore the appetizer menu. \n\nTheir appetizers... are not that great. I got the scallop half shell bake (something like that). I had a thought it was going to be a baked scallop in the shell topped with mayo or something. Instead it was baby scallops baked in a dish topped with a disgusting mayo sauce. I could hardly finish it. The boyfriend ordered the ahi poke (which i WAS going to order but didn't.. thank god!). I dunno what the heck what in there.. but it wasn't only ahi. There were other weird raw pieces of fish.. it was gross.\n\nService was quick and the workers there were very friendly! The lady even ran out after us to make sure we got the punch card. I will definitely be back, but will probably go to the Henderson location!"

You get the same thing for lunch, so it would be better to go for lunch if you can and pay less. They have a ton of rolls here-which are all really good-too many to mention. Alot are covered in sauces, but its not overboard like some other sushi restaurants. I also like how you can get a half order of the rolls. \n\nSushi seems fresh and the place is reliable. Waitresses are fast and available. I have tried to take out of town visitors here, but if they want some cool Vegas type place I guess this would not be the place to go. You would have to go on the strip, but then you pay for it there and portions are much smaller.\n\nI would like this place even more if they let you get sashimi!

I felt it was as good as it gets.   Then, it changed owners.\n\nThe new owner, a Japanese lady, watches every serving and every thing the Chefs do. One by one, the good chefs left. Things got worse;\n\nI was living in Maui, and used to fly back on Hawaiian Air every six weeks. I would send the crew from Hawaiian Air and every Islander I knew, to this place. \n\nOne night, I came in and the owner thanked me for all the people I sent. To reward me, I asked if I could substitute seaweed salad for my Miso Soup, with my Sushimi Dinner. She said, \"That's expensive, and I would have to pay extra\". \n\nBottom line; My son's girl friend called Sushi Mon \"the Mc Donald's of Sushi\".  She was right.  Read my review of Jjanga Japanese Grill. It's better quality, a little less money, and superior quality and service.\n\nAlso, you won't have to wait long for a table or seat at the bar. \n\nThis place has seen it's best days, and now rides on past reputation."

Usually there are a few items that scream out to me to get seconds of, yet everything was just mediocre. \n\nThe selection of nigiri had me reeling in uncertainty about what to order. I did find some of my usual items such as halibut, Cajun albacore, ika shiso, inari, red snapper, and a few others. Most of the fish were on the drier side. I did appreciate that they did not over sauce the fish to compensate for that. \n\nThe service was spotty at times. When the girls were around, they took their time with our demands, but after the food was delivered it is difficult to find someone."

Even the seaweed salad was bleh.\nAt least I didn't have to wait long when i got here at 615p. \nUh the service was good and I did enjoy my miso soup. \nI am going to have to come back and give them a second chance since I do have a free all you can eat card filled up.

Well, this can happen to any restaurant. I guess the reaction of the waiter was more disappointing than the rotten orange, once I show him my plate he never offer to replace the orange, simply reply with \"I'm sorry about the orange\" I was not looking for a free meal, I only expected the waiter to care a bit more and asked me if he can replace it. Well... I was charged full price; but they got $0 tip well deserved.\n\nSuggestion to the restaurant:\nIf you fell most people don't eat the 1/2 orange at the end of their meal, simply add a plastic one just for looks.\n\nTrain your employees to \"show\" appreciation for your customers no matter if they don't order your \"All You can Eat\""

I raved about this place to my husband, and when he finally had it, he agreed. At first, he didn't like the time limit, but he fould out that it's not so bad after all. There is a punch card (buy 10 get one free) available. You can order half rolls (except Spider Roll). \n\nThere is sushi bar seating (where we sit) and tables lining up the walls, but again, this is a small place. It's got a good reputation, so I imagine that there are regulars. (Note: there is a funny smell near the bathroom, so I am mentioning this if you are particularly sensitive to smell, do not sit in that area.)  Anyway, once seated at the bar, the waitress takes your order for the side orders/appetizers like seaweed salad, edamame, soup, etc. (Note: the list is huge so pace yourself.)  \nThe sushi chef asks you for your sushi order soon after. Try the specialty rolls like Mexican, Caterpillar, Hawaiian- seriously the sushi roll menu is two pages long (front & back). Once I tried the Spicy roll and it was al little much for me. The chef kept looking at me to see if I would finish it and I did! It may feel overwhelming at first, but remember, you can order half- rolls. The fish is so fresh. It's so good. The service is excellent. Note: if you're ordering something that take more prep time than usual, order that first, rather than last. For dessert,  I like green tea ice cream. There were a couple times that I had so much sushi that I didn't have ice cream (And I love love love ice cream!). Lunch AYCE is $23.95 and Dinner AYCE is $28.95.\n\nI've been here for lunch several times. I ordered a lunch special which was pretty good and very reasonable ($9.95 or less).

This place has its fair share of innovative rolls to appeal to the not so adventurous sushi eater and plenty of the classic nigiris for the traditionalists.\n\nI tend to stick to the nigiri sushi to start with and it was actually surprisingly better than I expected.  Don't get me wrong, its not the fresh from the fish monger, like blue fin tuna from Japan or toro, but its better than a Todai or most other AYCE places.  They even allow you to do individual nigiri or half rolls so that you don't waste!  What a great option.\n\nI have to say that I enjoyed the yellowtail, albacore and seared tuna here quite a bit.

My friends and I came here after a full day of cruising the strip and felt like gorging ourselves with some good sushi.   The decor is about average for a small sushi place.  The service was great as we had what felt like 3 servers going in and out of our table.  About half of our group ordered all you can eat and the rest ordered a la carte.   Their list of rolls is probably the most expansive I've seen so far.  Since i got the all you can eat I ordered a couple rolls to start off with before a server let me know that I can order half rolls.\n\nBeing able to order half rolls in an all you can sushi place is like the invention of sliced bread for a bakery; it was astonishing how much more of the menu I tried just because of the ability to order most things at half portions.  Most of the rolls were great and some were just too weird for my taste buds.  Another plus to the menu was the choice of dessert that comes with the all you can eat order.  Maybe I haven't been to enough sushi places but most that I know do not include desserts in their orders.  All in all, I had about 5 half rolls, 3 full rolls ( I can't remember what they were though...) and some mochi ice cream for good measure.  I came out of the place waddling like a penguin due to the food knocking my center of gravity out of whack.  Overall, 5 stars for the great service, good food, half order ability and dessert offerings.

So it's four rolls for about $4-5 dollars an order. \nI love it because this way I get to try all the rolls I want without stuffing myself and still end up paying less than all-you-can-eat (but I always go with a friend though so we split the bill, usually around $20-25 each after tip when we have about 7 half rolls. \n\nMy favorites:\n\n- New York Girl in Las Vegas (unique salmon w/ cream cheese and a lemon slice)\n- Orion Roll (i LOVE the albacore on on the outside)\n- ANY of the baked rolls (Flying JJ, Volcano, Volcano 2-- too good.)\n\nOn an endnote-- the chefs are usually pretty friendly too and it's actually pretty nice sitting at the bar even when you're with someone. :]"

            "review": "One of the best AYCE sushi meals I've ever had, and it is the first & only AYCE sushi bar I've sat at where the food would come out faster than I can order.\nTheir ayce menu consists of a bunch of nigiri sushi, special rolls, and some appetizers/side dishes. \nThe gf & I ordered mainly the nigiri: Yellow tail, Salmon/seared salmon, and Albacore/Cajun albacore. The shrimp tempura was really good too.\nAlthough their nigiri pieces were sometimes small, I was never unhappy about the fish to rice ratio. It also didn't matter if the pieces were sometimes smaller - we sat at the bar and whenever we wanted to order something we just yelled it out, like \"3 more salmon!\" and in less than a minute the chef would hand us the plate of our order.\nUsually at any decent or good ayce sushi bar, you gotta wait a good amount of time in between orders, plus you're given a limit on the amount you can order at a time, and sometimes they even pack on the rice to try to get their customers full. Sushi Mon doesn't do this. They say that they give you a 60 minute time limit which sounds not cool at first, but when you are constantly handed plate after plate of whatever you order, I guarantee you'll be full within half an hour. At the end of our meal my gf & I had a 15+ stack of empty plates in front of us, I'll post a picture of this soon. Highly recommended you sit at the bar.\nA good 20 minute drive off the strip, but totally worth it for a very satisfying meal with friendly and attentive servers & chefs.\n\nNotes:\n*They don't put a full wad of wasabi like authentic Japanese sushi bars, but they do put a little smudge in there. I loved that they did this, since most American Japanese sushi bars don't make their nigiri with wasabi in it. My gf didn't like this, so she requested that they don't put any wasabi in the nigiri sushi and the chefs gladly did this for her.\n**There is another Sushi Mon more south of the Strip. We asked a chef if this Sushi Mon and the other were acquainted and learned that they once were, but not anymore."

The fish has always been consistently fresh and good over about a dozen visits for both dinner and lunch, generally a step above, say, Kabuki, but not as good as, say, Sushi Gen in Los Angeles.\n\nAbout $24 (lunch) to $28 (dinner) gets you an hour to order from an extensive menu of sushi basics, a wide variety of rolls, and non-sushi items like seaweed salad, baked green mussels, chicken skewers, and fried oysters.  Beverages not included, so add a couple bucks more for that, plus tax and tip.\n\nService here is generally good, with everyone friendly.  It does get a little crowded on some nights, so if you go for dinner, be prepared for a bit of a wait as they don't have a ton of seating.\n\nTip: Rolls can be ordered as half-orders, giving you more room to try different things!"

After being devastated from the news that Kan Pai no longer had AYCE sushi, Kuge was able to find Sushi Mon about 1000 feet away.\n\nWhen Kuge arrived, he noticed Sushi Mon was more packed than the his Smackdown Hotel.  But luckily Kuge and two of his friends were greeted instantly upon walking in by the friendly hostess and were placed at the sushi bar.\n\nIt was as if a double rainbow appeared in front of Kuge as he gazed at the AYCE menu and what Sushi Mon had to offer.  With a great selection of sushi and nigari, Kuge knew he had to try many different kinds of rolls to get the full Sushi-Mon experience.\n\nSome rolls The Great One ordered:\n\nChubby Roll - Phenomenal,  it was only a 5 roll count but it was a great size and Kuge had no problems with the roll.\n\nSunrise Roll - Since Kuge isn't a great sushi elitist, nor is professional food reviewer, he is stuck using generic terms without much description.  But other wise, Kuge believes this roll had a variety of flavors and was decent.\n\n9-1-1 Roll - The Great One never takes spicy rolls seriously since he loves to pretend to be Mexican and believes he can handle spice.  The 9-1-1 roll completely destroyed Kuge's tastebuds with insane spice he never expected to happen.  Unfortunately the spice overcame any flavor Kuge would try to find.  \n\nFresh Water Eel - Alright\n\nThere were a few other \"special\" rolls that Kuge ordered, but he is sadden that they were only average at best.\n\nThe service from the cooks and speed of the order Kuge received was great.  The staff was friendly, although the friends of The Great One complained that they didn't have that good of service which displeases Kuge.\n\nNo worries though, Kuge acknowledges that he strives to create perfect reviews but even they are long winded.  So in order to please his fans:\n\nTL;DR - Kuge was saddened that most of the rolls he ordered were average (with an exception of chubby roll) and even though the service was good for him, he cannot give Sushi Mon  no more than 3.5 Rock Bottoms out of 5.  He definitely prefers Sushi Mon over Hakari for AYCE but that's as far as he'll go."

When you hear of a all-you-can-eat sushi place, you generally think of not so fresh, huge fistful of rice to fish ratio sushi.  At Sushi Mon, you get good quality sushi in unlimited quantity.  Unlike other buffet places, where the sushi is already made and set out for you, Sushi Mon makes everything as you order...the gluttonous hour begins.\n\nFar off the Strip on the west side, Sushi Mon is always packed with a young energetic crowd.  The all you can eat menu extends not only to sushi,but literally everything on the menu from rolls, apps, teriyaki, tempura, salads,... the fried yellow tail head with ponzu and the seaweed salad are good starters.  You can only get 1 order of Uni per customer but I don't like that nasty orange puke anyways, so it doesn't  affect me at all.  Try the '911' roll if you dare, its got a huge spicy kick to it that'll wake up all your senses!~  No matter how full I get, I always end my meals with green tea ice cream, fried banana and strawberry mochi.  Be sure to get started on a punch card so you can get the 11th meal free!\n\nI recommend you sit at the sushi bar so you can tell your order to the sushi chef.  There is usually a line out the door and no bar to wait.  There is a hookah lounge on the other side of the strip mall, but otherwise, but I like to take the time waiting, salivating through the window and mentally preparing myself for the hour of sushi chaos."

Why did we choose sushi to eat while hungover, I'll never know, but it did not stop the food from being delicious!\n\nWe came right as it opened at 11:30AM on Sunday, it actually opened a little bit earlier too, which is also a plus. Came with a party of 6 for AYCE, so we were able to try a lot of their sushi & rolls. Their cuts of fish were thick and very good. Our favorite sushi was the salmon and yellowtail. The tuna also was not bad though I didn't try any of their other sushi. As for the rolls, we ordered the Vegas, dragon, rainbow, miles, and the Orion roll. They were all delicious, but would only recommend the Orion roll for those who like a more peppery taste. The ahipoki and baked mussels are also worth a try. I ended my meal with red bean ice cream; it wasn't what I expected, but was still a nice sweet, cold treat to end a filling sushi meal.\n\nFor the service, it was pretty good. Did wish the sushi and rolls came out a bit quicker. Water was always filled and our waitresses got every order we threw at her, & it was quite a bit.

The menu is hard to navigate for a Sushi Simpleton like me . I don't order any sushi that has raw fish in it ..I mainly stick to the rolls with the fake crab . One side had the descriptions on it but the other side of the menu ...you are on your own! We had the Royal California Roll which was deep fried. I tried something similar before and I wasn't to crazy about it so we started with a half order. I love that you can do that because I hate when you're forced to eat the whole order just so there will not be an extra charge! I loved the Royal California it had a nice crunch to it. I also tried the J.J. Roll which had Asparagus and cream cheese in it ..that was also good. I ordered one of my regulars The Mexican..nice and spicy. We tried the Snow Crab roll (limit 2 per customer) ...thank goodness there was a limit! It was hard for me to eat it because it just didn't taste good. I was let down that they had Chicken Terayaki but no beef I know this is a sushi place and not a steak house but it would have been nice. The chicken was tasty and tender and the sauce wasn't too sweet. I ended my meal with green tea ice cream ..I was so stuffed I could only eat half of it..

I tried it anyway, knowing sometimes I can be picky about the way things look, and I had to spit it out into my napkin. I've never tasted such disgusting fish.

(I want to drink Sake and SAKE BOMBS, argghhh!!!!)  the service was awful.  the waiter kept reminding our group that all-u-can eat sushi had a time limit and that we had to finish all our orders, including the rice.  i was truly offended at the comments.  i came from Reno, where i still believe the concept of all-u-can eat sushi at the sushi bar began (this was about 16yrs ago...props to Sushi Teri).  We were also very hungry, it was not necessary to remind us.  i mean it's even written in the menu.  at that point my friend and i was pissed.  the two of us to start a mission to target one item on menu and make them run out of it.  we  targeted the mussels.  we kept ordering 4 orders of them (about 5 times).  it came to the point where our waiter kept avoiding our table and avoiding making eye contact with my friend and i.  i finally got him to return to the the table, so i can ask for some more.  he was apologetic to tell us that he can only give us 1 more order because they had no more left. ha..ha...ha  our mission was complete along with eating several orders of sushi, some tempura, some edamame, yellow tail collar, and some ice cream and mochi.  \nthe all-u-can-eat  menu is quite extensive.  they have several types of appetizers, nigiri, hand rolls, long rolls, and dessert items.  i haven't tried that many rolls b/c i just love nigiri and the rolls fill you up too fast .    im disappointed that they limit you to only 2 orders of ama-ebi and toro. i think their ama-ebi was crap anyway.  i don't think it's really sweet shrimp.  yeah, this is one of the better all-u-can eat sushi place in vegas, but i doubt it is the best.  so the search goes on...."

Two in our group were locals and took us to sushi mon. Its a small place but worth the wait and the money.  That time I secretly shared the sushi with a friend and it was soooo good!!\n\nSecond time I was there (around August) we ate at sushimon for dinner our first night there and I wasn't disapointed! We sat right at the sushi bar and ordered all the sushi we can ever want~ My friend tried the uni (the urchin) and dispite its poop looking apearence she said it was pretty good. I loved the shrimp shushi and the sauce they put on most of their rolls were very flavorful! I ate my money's worth! \n\nI recomend after you eat, go to the restaurant that is behind it. I forgot the name of it but its a restaurant and karaoke place. Their karaoke is fairly priced and they have so many songs to choose from.  The rooms are very pretty too! I wish my bedroom looked like it! pretty decorations and atmosphere!!~"

They won't let you share if you are doing the AYCE and a friend isn't.\n\nWhen i feel like having sushi at work for lunch, I always call here for an order to pick up ;) Its really convenient and ready to pick up in 10 Minutes. \n\nI usually come here for the AYCE special. You have two sides on the menu and the appetizers and ice cream desserts are also included in the AYCE menu. \n\nThe shrimp Tempura and the Ahi Poke are my two favorite appetizers. I will usually order five servings in one sitting. ;) Great stuff. \n\nMy newest favorite roll there is the Mesquite Roll. Its a Spicy tuna roll topped with Raw Salmon and Mango strips topped with a mango chutney sauce. This roll is refreshing and different from the usual rolls on the menu. \n\nThe place is usually always busy when i go there to eat and the staff usually is very attentive. \n\nYou must try some of the baked rolls that they have on the menu, its really good and I am starting to order those a lot more every time i visit. I order the Jason Roll: California roll with scallops and cream cheese, baked and topped with yum yum sauce. It melts in your mouth, but watch out, let it cool down before biting into it its HOT. and attempting to pick it up while hot is a no-go. haha unless you want it on your clothes...i would wait a little bit. \n\nThis place is family friendly and don't forget to try some of the special rolls that they put out (usually its written on paper and pasted on the walls in the restaurant) \n\nHappy dining!!!"

We're all from Hawaii and 3 of my friends work at a sushi restaurant, so we know what we wanted and knew what sushi is supposed to taste like. I'm going to admit, I was satisfied. Sushi in the desert, who would've thought this place would be genuinely great!\n\nAll you can eat everything! Maguro, salmon, spicy tuna, tobiko, ikura, ebi, etc. They also have a wide selection of rolls to eat from. Funny story, we were half way through our eating frenzy when one of my friends orders the 911 roll. It's one of the hottest, if not the hottest roll on the menu. It wasn't a tasty hot, like sriacha sauce or like a tobasco. It was a burn a hole through my stomach hot! I'm so glad I had eaten sushi before I tried the roll because for the rest of the night my tongue was fried and all I ate was ice cream :(\n\nGreat selection of sushi for an all you can eat restaurant, puts all the Hawaii sushi joints to shame. Great place to bring sushi lovers and non-Vegas peeps."

            "review": "Craving sushi, but wanting to be off the strip, I was referred to Sushi Mon by a resident of Vegas.  \nMy dining companion asked if this restaurant had a time limit on how long you could eat there and I looked at her like she was insane.  Well, she was correct to ask as there was a time limit on the All-You-Can-Eat Sushi option.  (I had yet to have ever experienced an All You Can Eat place that had restrictions on time, and this apparently was going to be my first.  Were they going to be put a timer on the table?)  \n\nTheir menu selection is quite large and ranges from appetizers, to nigiri, to dessert even!  There are a few items that you are limited to (2 per person) and there were out of a few 'hot' items on a Saturday night.  We were told there might be a wait, but there actually was none.  We sat at the sushi bar so we could order directly from the sushi chefs.  Quite a few other patrons and the sushi chefs commented on how surprisingly slow it was that evening.  Despite the slow night, the chefs were too busy watching TV to pay much attention to the customers and we felt like we had to wave them down to get their attention.    \n\nThe food was okay - there were some good rolls and some alright items.  I recall not wanting to finish some cooked fish appetizer I ordered.  It wasn't all that great.  The spicy tuna roll wasn't up to par with what I had in mind.\n\nService was okay.  I think one of the waitresses didn't understand English very well, so she had to get her colleague to help us out a lot.  We were a little offended when we ordered our dessert and they returned with the check as well.  (Uh, we weren't done yet, and our hour wasn't up yet either.) \n\nOverall, I felt rushed watching my 'hour' time limit.  I think we paid about $25 each for this All You Can Eat but figured it was a good deal.  After all, once you order a couple of rolls and nigiri, you've spent that much money already.  If All You Can Eat Sushi is what you want, Sushi Mon will give that to you. And with the various choices from hot and cold items, it gives you a bigger range to choose from.  \n\nCan't beat mochi and/or ice cream for dessert either!   \n\nIt also says on their website that they are open until 2 am!  Wow.\n\nSide note: They also have a frequent eater card.  We like places that offer frequent eater cards. Be sure to get yours!\n\nUpdate! 11/05/07 - Went back last night, and dinner is now $25.95.  Limited items on the all-you-can-eat is the Toro, Amaebi, Uni, Baked Oyster, and Sake Shooter.  They only have two ice cream flavors - Green Tea and something else, and only Strawberry Mochi.  The BF and the brother loved the Baked Mussels.  They also offer amaebi head soup, which is a nice twist.  Nigiri was pretty good with good slices of fish and small amounts of rice.  We definitely appreciate they aren't trying to stuff us with the rice!\n\nSidenote: They don't take reservations!"

She dropped off our food at the table next to us, and then attempted to bring it to us after the diners had been poking at it in confusion.  Items were forgotten and never brought out, and no apologies were ever offered.  \n\nMy biggest issue here is that it says all over the menu, \"We charge for leftover food, including rice, 45 minute time limit.\"  If you're going to impose strict eating guidelines on your customers, at least present them with a pleasant experience and decent food.  \n\nThere are many AYCE places in town, I wouldn't return to this one."

I regularly get seaweed salad, poke salad (I mix them up together), dynamite and fried oysters. \n\n Love that they do half rolls as I like variety and dont want to be stuck trying a new roll and discovering I don't like it yet have to commit to consuming it. Love their moon roll and sunrise roll! I'm not even a \"roll person\" but I enjoy those two.  I normally go simple though- am a sucker for salmon skin handrolls and can eat quite a few of these. \n\nThe chefs slices nigiri thick-this place doesn't skimp on fish and do not pile on too much rice. The fish is pretty fresh and the bulk of what I eat is nigiri so I can tell when it's not. I have some days here where certain fish is just okay, but overall they keep a decent standard. There are a few things not on the nigiri menu such as Toro and White Tuna so be sure to ask the sushi chefs if there's off menu items that day. Both are my fave and not to be missed, there is a 1 order limit on the Toro, Amaebi and Uni though. Off the regular menu, I tend to grab yellowtail, albacore and their cajun albacore is nice to have something different. \n\nUsually places slow the service to pace you through your AYCE to eat less,some I think purposely put some of the expensive things til the end, some \"lose\" your order too- not the case here. They serve it pretty fast and as you ordered it.  We've been here plenty of times when there's few tables near closing and gotten great service. That standard of service still held when nearly a dozen are waiting outside for a table. To me, that deserve a lot of merit and is why I gave them 5 stars. Sushi Mon staff really works hard to attain good service- they work their butt off! Hats off!\n\nAlso the little old lady is so cute. She remembers our names and says it in her cute accent. Specially my boyfriends name....Scott is Scott-to. I appreciate and impressed she remembers us each time we come in and the chefs and servers know us too...but then again, we've been in so often it's hard not to notice."

We opted for the lunch buffet which includes everything on the menu.  I appreciate that you can order rolls in halves because we would definitely not have been able to try the many other dishes.  The down part is, if you don't finish everything you have to pay for it. Thus, half orders are a great way to prevent waste.  The lunch buffet is about $24.99 and the dinner buffet (with the same options) is $26.99. \n\nBaked Mussels: WOW WOW. I don't even like mussels but these were so amazing! Make sure you are careful though, I grabbed the shell right when the waiter brought it out (because I'm an impatient pig) and boy did I burn my thumb, it was red for the rest of the day.\n\nWhite Tuna and Uni (Eel) Sashimi: AMAZING AMAZING. The only negative part is that every slice of sashimi is over rice.  And you have to eat all the rice or else you will get charged.\n\nMonster Roll: They make it sound like it was a ginormous roll.

The fish was fresh and tasty.  \n\nService was good.  There was a misstep or two when something ordered was not brought but given the amount we ordered, I guess I could expect this.  \n\nMy biggest issue with the place is that it is so small.  5 people at one table and with all the plates that were brought meant that our table was quite crowded.  This made for good conversation and sharing of what had been ordered, but I was amazed I didn't elbow one of my dining companions during the meal.\n\nThere is a 45 minute time limit for lunch and an hour for dinner but the way we scarfed everything down, we almost had time to spare although we weren't watching the time and I don't think they were either.\n\nThe red bean ice cream for dessert was very good.

Our other friend suggested this place, and said for $27, you can get all you can eat sushi as well as anything else on their menu.\n\nIt's a fairly small place and it took us about 20 minutes to get a seat.  Not too bad a wait, but since all of us were so hungry, it seemed like forever.\n\nOnce you sit down, you can start ordering.  Stick to the nigiri choices, unless there are some rolls on the menu that look good (we ordered quite a few spider rolls).  A brief breakdown of what we ordered:\n\nSalmon nigiri - 5/5\nMaguro - 4/5\nEbi - 5/5\nHamachi - 4/5\nUnagi - 5/5\nSpider roll - 5/5\nShrimp heads - 4/5\nUni- 1/5 (color and taste was not good)...the only thing that sucked\n\nOrders came out fairly quickly.  I liked the fact that the rice balls for the nigiri were small sized....this place doesn't try to fill you up on the rice.  Everything was really fresh and tasty.  Service was friendly and efficient.\n\nOne hour later, we waddled out, having completely killed this place.  I'd definitely go back again."

We needed service for 3 adults & 1 child.  We had to wait for a table, no problem. There is no waiting area. We stood there, blocking the door with our 2 infant car seats, toddler, & 3 adults.  Who's gonna wait outside in the 100deg heat?!   We finally sat down at 1:50, the tables had been clear for a good 10 mins before they finally sat us.   Another 15 mins to tell them we wanted AYCE, we were able to order some food.  \nCons: SLOW AND INCONSIDERATE STAFF.  They need more help, 2 servers & a busser were clearly not enough for the busy lunch hour.  I heard the busboy tell the server we were ready, he simply said ok, I'll be there.  Then 10 more mins passed by.  Not that he wasn't busy, but he was too busy doing other things then to come & take our order.  Then he & the other server had to discuss which one was taking our table.\n-The red bean ice cream they served was old-tasting & old-looking.  My friend asked if she could get another since it was so ice cold, her spoon was about to become disfigured as she tried to eat it, but the server said that was how it came, \"hard as a brick, sorry\".  \n-We had to flag them down for everything...\nPros:\n-the AYCE menu included hot/cold appetizers as well.  I thought that was a good deal. \n\nBe back? Probably not, since there are at least 3 more sushi restaurants within a 5 mile radius competing for my business."

There are a wide variety of rolls so you're bound to find some that you like.  Most AYCE places I've been skimp on the quality and usually cover all their sushi with the same mayonnaise sauce.  Each roll we had here was different, but still flavorful.  They give you a good amount of fish with each roll.  They don't have too much rice and the toppings are generous.\n\nYou can also order half-rolls so you can get a taste of different things without stuffing yourself on one.\n\nThe best part are the specials.  The specials are included in the AYCE and are written up somewhere.  My favorite was the Salmon Carpaccio.  Their sashimi was very smooth and generous! They also had salmon collar and hamachi collar along with uni, snow crab, sweet shrimp, and several others.  \n\nThere are a couple reasons why its not five stars:\n- It's pretty small (we came with a big party and had to split up)\n- The servers mixed our orders up with the table next to us several times\n- They ran out of green tea  and plum ice cream.\n- Our seat was by the door and everytime someone opened it, we got that cold Las Vegas air\n\nI would definitely come here again.  The food is great and authentic and better than any AYCE place I've been to yet."

Everything is made fresh to order and they have a wide variety of rolls. The best thing is that you can do half orders so you can try everything!! I really don't get how they make money?! haha They even have a punch card and after 12 meals you get a free one! They aren't skimpy on their fish and they don't over power the rolls with excessive rice. \n\nThe only bad thing I have to say, is that sometimes the sushi orders aren't cut the best and it has the little silver fiber thingies which doesn't make for easy eating. But the rolls are so yummy. They had a new roll \"mesquite\" which was reaaaaly good - spicy tuna roll topped with mango, salmon and a yummy mango sauce. The mahi roll is good - it has mahi mahi, asparagus and shizo leaves. The chubby roll, hawaiian, spider and orion are all great too! They have poke and seaweed salad too! \n\nIf you go with people that aren't huge sushi eaters - they can either order off their menu or do the all you can eat which also includes tempura, gyoza, teriyaki, miso and more. Plus ice cream!! Red bean, green tea or plum wine. So worth the money!  And they are open til 2 AM so perfect after those late night gambling runs!!"

This place is no where near the strip, you're going to take a lovely drive on Sahara before you reach this place. it's easily missed in this plaza since it's kind of hidden in the corner so keep your eyes peeled.\n\nWe were warned that this place gets packed so we actually arrived at 5pm for dinner on a Saturday during Memorial Weekend. It was probably a good idea to eat early anyways since we were planning to tear it up later on that night. The 7 of us all sat at the sushi bar. The restaurant isn't that big in general.\n\nWe now had 60 minutes to play man versus food. For AYCE, that's the time limit. On a good note, they had unlimited hot sake free with the AYCE too but we passed on it to concentrate all our efforts on the food. Anything and everything on the menu was a green light. Wo said keep en eye for the items on the boards but I never saw the boards.\n\nI honestly have low expectations for Japanese AYCE period. Todai was great the first 2-3 times then you realize how whack it is. Fortunately, Sushi Mon wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Plus they pumped out our orders with a mad quickness (made to order and not already rotting out). They have everything from sushi (cajun albacore is note worthy) to crazy rolls and you can even order ice cream (green tea, plum, and red bean) for dessert. I don't think the AYCE is mandatory but if someone in your party decides to go with it, I believe everyone on your table needs to be on the same page. Nah mean?\n\nBe warned though that some of the rolls are rice and kewpie (Japanese mayo) heavy and that's going to put a major road block in your appetite. For some of the crazy rolls (8 pieces) you may ask them to make it a half order. If the roll is 5 pieces like the spider roll (soft shell crab) they will not make a half order for it. Every creation on the menu sounds crazy but stick with what you know first. Play it safe before you venture out too far. Certain rolls like the lasagna or volcano rolls are way too rich and heavy. Those are under the baked rolls. I'd keep away from those.\n\nAll in all, the place wasn't too bad. I wouldn't say I need to come back to Sushi Mon everytime I am in Vegas but if someone was to ask for a Japanese AYCE joint, they would be mentioned. The quality was decent and the waitresses were friendly. With drinks, tax, & tip, we ended up paying around $30 something each. Not too shabby. Bring that appetite if you come here for some AYCE sushi. Get in mahhh belly!"

            "review": "A VERY GOOD AYCE SUSHI PLACE ON THE WEST SIDE\nSushi Mon is on of a myriad All You Can Eat (AYCE) Sushi restaurants throughout Las Vegas. For the most part, I have had favorable experiences at the AYCE places in Vegas. In the old days, AYCE meant Buffet Style like Makino. Makino was fine, but sushi lovers knew that the price you had to pay for AYCE was that it was not as good as Made To Order. But a few years ago the AYCE trend caught on at many of the good sushi places that were only set up for Made To Order and that is when AYCE Sushi really took off. Really, there are so many AYCE Made To Order places in Vegas I don't know how the places that don't have AYCE stay in business.\n\nIn November 2009, AYCE Made To Order Sushi in Las Vegas is going for between $24 and $28. My eleven year old son, Tristan, can eat $28 of sushi in about 15 minutes, so we make out way ahead, dollars wise. What would normally be a $150-$200 bill ends up being just under $100 for three people (with drinks and tax).\n\nIn Henderson, my favorite place is The Ka (Warm Springs & Green Valley). The sushi is top-notch for AYCE and the atmosphere is actually very good for a sushi place. Most sushi places that put any effort into their atmosphere tend to charge much more than the other sushi places, but not The Ka. Additionally, the sushi chefs at The Ka have quite a bit of personality (which makes up for their challenged English... hey, I can barely speak any Japanese, if THAT is what they are speaking, so they're doing much better than me on the bilingual thing.)\n\nNow that we're living on the \"West Side\" we have to find a place to get our sushi fix. My girlfriend lived over here recently anyways and Sushi Mon was \"her place.\" We actually went to Sushi Mon for our first date although neither of us were really paying much attention to what was going into our mouths in the restaurant that day.\n\nThe quality and selection of the sushi is very good. I like to gage my sushi places by the quality of the salmon (aka \"sake\") and I was not disappointed. It was very soft, smooth, and very tasty. My girlfriend likes to use the Yellowtail as her gage and it certainly passes muster with her as with me. We had a variety of the typical rolls you can get in Vegas and each one of them was good to great.\n\nThe atmosphere is typical for Las Vegas sushi restaurants, at least the non-casino places. It always seems to be busy here and it seems they would be able to fill a few more tables if they had the room for it. Not much for decoration but there's nothing disconcerting about it either. The most important part is that it is clean, which it is. The sushi chefs were very good and surprisingly fast (in spite of a packed place). I wish they had a little more personality but I probably need to go back a few more times and start some kind of rapport with them and they'd probably be just fine.\n\nHere's a kicker for me: THEY HAVE A STAMP CARD. Your 10th AYCE is free, which is like getting $2.80 off each meal. Not all places do this in Las Vegas and if you're looking for a new \"favorite place,\" this certainly helps tip things in favor of a place who does have a stamp card.\n\nIf you're looking for All You Can Eat Made To Order Sushi on the West Side of Las Vegas I would recommend that you check this place out. I'm sure there are other good places in the area, but this one is good for me."

The hokki... well it tasted like hokki. I didn't like it too much but I think the hokki I had in Japan tasted the same. The amount of rice was perfect as well. Not too much, not too little. I also had the Caterpillar Roll and the American Dream Roll. Both are unagi-based rolls and they were good. It was on the menu, but they didn't have hirame. bummer.\n\nThe only complaint I have of this restaurant was the grumpy old sushi chef . I'll refer to him as Gosc from here on. You'll know who I'm talking about when you go there. My wife and I were seated at the sushi bar right in front of him. Instead of ordering sushi from the waitresses, we were told to order our sushi directly from the Gosc. I guess it was because he was busy, he seemed really crabby and didn't acknowledge us at all. We tried to get his attention and he told us to wait. There was a sign on the table to tell customers to order a little at a time. We did that when we ordered, but the Gosc growled back at us and said something like \"order more at once because it's busy and that's easier for me!\" To be fair, I think it could've been a language issue. He may have had problems expressing himself in English and it made him sound like a Gosc... Or maybe he WAS a Gosc. His mood did improve once the busYness subsided and we were able to make some friendly small talk afterwards. \n\nGreat sushi for a good price TRUMPS the bad service. I will probably go there again the next time I visit Vegas. And this time I will try there dinner menu, which includes amaebi, snow crab, and uni. and maybe they will have hirame next time...."

THIS PLACE IS A STEAL!!! it makes me mad they don't have places like this in hawaii...\n\nCONS:\nit's not that big, so (especially if you're with a group) be prepared to wait.  supposedly there is a 60 minute limit for your all you can eat, but i wasn't too aware of it.  hope and pray there isn't a fat family sitting on the table infront of you, cause you're gonna wait forever...and they don't take reservations\n\nWHAT I ATE:\n(All you can eat for $26.99)\n\n- Chubby Roll\n- Vegas Roll\n- Takwon Roll?\n- Red Bean (Azuki) Ice Cream\n- I ate more but i can't remember...\n\nWHY HERE FOR YOUR VACA?:\nif you love legit japanese from japan sushi or hate raw fish you're probably not gonna care for this place too much.  but if you're like me and CRAVE sushi rolls all the time, you'll be in heaven!!! there is so much to pick from, you'll feel like your head is going to explode.  it is far of the strip (about a 20 min or $30 cab ride)...but if i go to vegas again...i am DEFINETLY coming back!!! with my stretchy pants..."

I think the crunchiness of the rice really makes this roll special.\nAlso tried a mexican roll - very spicy  I loved it. \nshrimp tempura- extremely light and crispy.\nchicken teriyaki- so good and not too sweet.\nJJ roll - was extremely good and even had asparagus in it. This was new to me.

It was worth the wait and drive tho!\n\nWe decided on their $29 all-you-can eat sushi and drink for 1 hour.  Usually I wouldn't consider an all-you-can eat sushi place, but the fish at the sushi bar looked pretty good.   Besides ordering Sushi, you can order their special rolls (Dragon Rolls, Spider Rolls, etc), hand rolls, side dishes (seaweed salad, miso soup, etc), and even green tea, red bean, or plum ice cream.   You can pretty much order any kind of sushi except for maybe some of the more expensive ones like Sweet Shrimp (ebi), and there's some items that you can order only 1 of, like Snow Crab Sushi, Saki Shooters, Fried Oyster and maybe a couple more.  Everything was very good and the fish was very fresh, almost melting in my mouth.  Probably the only thing I wouldn't recommend is the Yum Yum Scallop Sushi.  I love scallop sushi, but this was actually baked scallop with shredded imitation crab meat mixed with an orange colored mayo...wasn't that great in my opinion.  So other than that, the fish was great....salmon, albacore, tuna, etc., The Snow Crab and Fried Oyster were excellent, and even the ice cream was good.  And they didn't put huge blocks of rice with the fish to fill you up either :)\n\nService was excellent.  The japanese waitresses were very nice and prompt.  Sushi was served very fast and they didn't rush us out after an hour, even though they said there was an hour limit and we were stuffed by then anyway.  We easily ate over $200 in food (according to their a la carte prices). I was also happy to spend $38 on sushi rather than on a Vegas buffet.   I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for sushi in Las Vegas.  They also have a dinner menu so you don't have to order all-you-can eat if you don't want to."

We noticed a big change with the new management.  Place looks old and bathrooms need cleaning. The food was really disappointing. None of the fish seemed all that fresh although the tempura was still good. If you loved the old Sushi Mon, you may be disappointed with the changes as they are not for the better."

My boyfriend and I have been there twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. the dinner all you can eat is about 26 and the lunch is 23. If you dont plan on eating more than two full rolls, make sure to choose the a la carte option. The all you can eat apparently comes with a free side, which includes stuff like miso soup and a free dessert, which we were never able to try. The cooks make the sushi in front of you if you sit at the bar. I would definitely recommend sitting at the bar. The chefs are very nice, but have pretty big accents, so sometimes it was hard to understand them. They also have a frequent diner card, for a free meal after your 10th meal. Definitely recommend to anyone in the area. Try the JJ roll which is fantastic."

Found it out of the blue, and never looked back. They have AYCE and a la carte menus, and handle each with grace. \nMy experience?\n~ The sushi and rolls are always delicious. They handle special requests easily (i.e. I would like this roll, but with salmon instead of tuna, soy paper instead of Nori, 911 sauce on the side, etc.)\n~ They remember us. There is something to be said for staff remembering you, and bringing your drinks (water with extra lemon, hot green tea, etc.) without you even asking.\n~ The sushi chefs are personable and fun, and make for a good experience. \n~ The wait staff are super nice, and always make us feel welcome.\n~ They have a frequent AYCE card - get stamped every time and the 10th time is free (might be the 11th- I don't eat AYCE, but the other half does, and they don't even hesitate to honor it)\n~ It doesn't matter who your waitress is; everyone will help you.\nI just went there last night with my other half, and his parents, and we had a great time. The sushi was excellent (tuna melted like butter) and the rolls were excellent.\n\nP.S. The \"Love Boat\" is an amazing deal. Salmon is tender (it's a filet, and cooked - delicious), california rolls (just ask for the sushi bar to make them right then - they will), edamame, chicken yakitori skewers, salad (their dressing is YUM) with chicken, miso soup, and tempura shrimp and veggies. All for $11.95. Great deal, and comes with a delicious sliced orange dessert too. \n\nI'm IN!"

Neither one of us were in the mood for rice so she ordered some edamame and tuna sashimi. The edamame was blah but the tuna was fabulous. 3 huge cuts of fish that were so rich in color and soft and buttery in texture.\n\nI got the sashimi dinner ($17.95), which came with miso soup (very good) and salad (nice, crisp lettuce with a peanut sauce drizzled on top). The sashimi consisted of 5 different types of fish, each with 3 generous slices. And by generous, I'm talking about half an inch thick. The tuna was clearly the best of the bunch, with the yellowtail not far behind. The salmon was also delicious and the white fish was decent. But the disappointment of the night was the albacore. It had a weird after-taste to it. The dinner also came with 2 pieces of crab. Before I ordered I wasn't sure if the dinner would fill me up but it turned out to be plenty of food. I didn't even have room to try the strawberry mochi.\n\nThe service was a little spotty. It took a while to get our drinks and they forgot the edamame, so we had to remind them. Then after we finished eating we waited and waited and finally had to flag someone down to bring the check. But, the fish is good enough to warrant a return visit.\n\n3.5 stars"

So when I moved to Reno, NV I was excited by AYCE sushi places with reasonable prices and an incredible selection of nigri, maki, and appetizers. \n\nI came to Vegas for a job interview, which went pretty well I might add, and rewarded myself in a typical fashion, with AYCE sushi. I figured how different could it be?\n\nI scoured Yelp for a while and came across Sushimon and Yama Sushi, the two most reviewed AYCE spots around. I chose Sushimon based on Yama reviews stating that they pre sliced their fish and one person had seen cockroaches. \n\nI pulled up and the place was pretty full, good sign, so I sat down and ate. The only memorable things were hamachi Kama and tempura sweet shrimp heads, and they were memorable only because they aren't typically available at my sushi spot in Reno.  \n\nAs a sushi fanatic, there is a price point at which I would rather enjoy the taste and art of well prepared sushi, than gorge myself on very mediocre stuff. And at $30, this hits that spot!\n\nBottom line is people from Las Vegas should know what good food is, and this sure ain't it.\n\n2.5 stars for friendly sushi chef, hamachi Kama, sweet shrimp heads, and plum ice cream. They also get points for serving half rolls."

            "review": "Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you the greatest sushi I have ever had in my life. I lived on Japanese food for many years, but even I have to vouch for this place, despite its location in America, in the middle of the freakin' desert of all places.\n\nWhen I say this, I am talking about the quality of the food, the system of pricing, and the accessibility of the restaurant itself. Everything is to the advantage of the customer, which makes me wonder how this place stays in business.\n\nFirst of all, quality. I don't know how they manage to keep the raw fish that fresh this far inland, but they make it work. The fish tastes like it was caught that morning. The fact that they make everything to order and slice the fish in front of you certainly guarantees a product right at the threshold of optimal quality. I ordered from all over the menu, but after a couple bites of the salmon nigiri, I have to say that this is my favorite. It's a real basic menu item that was exceptionally tasty and needed little or no soy sauce to enjoy. The seared salmon is pretty good, too, in case you're in the mood for something a little more cooked, but definitely try the salmon.\n\nSecondly, the price. Currently, the All-You-Can-Eat Lunch price is $21.95. Normally it ends up costing that much anyway for a full meal when you order over the counter for a fresh cut, so an all-you-can-eat for that price is pretty insane. There were a few things that I probably would have never ordered \u00c0 la carte like the Mexican Rolls, but because I didn't have to worry about overspending on a gamble of taste, I was able to try an atypical variety of sushi adapted for the American palate. I never found anything I didn't like, however, and we probably tried a quarter of the menu over the course of two visits to the same Sushi Mon. Mind you, it is a big menu.\n\nLastly, the accessibility of the location. The Western Sahara Avenue location is far off the Las Vegas Strip, so it keeps the hoards of tourists away. On the two occasions my dad and I came here, parking was not an issue, and neither was seating. The only drawback is that for any all-you-can-eat order, you are restricted to a certain time limit. I suggest coming here on a weekday off-peak so that you can order without having to worry about long waits. When it gets busy, it can become difficult to flag down the sushi chef.\n\nWhatever their secret is, I hope the same Sushi Mon will always be there whenever I visit Vegas (the last time I was here was in August of 2012). It tops my list of favorite restaurants and is certainly worthy of being my 100th establishment to review. Thank you, Sushi Mon!!\n\nCheck out their website for more info here: http://www.sushi-mon.com/"

I could tell just by the hamachi which was served without ponzu sauce, it was not as fresh as from other places. \n\nAnd for $30 of AYCE with a 2 sided menu is just not as good of a selection. Everyone is probably sick of me comparing all AYCE to Xtreme Sushi but I really do prefer Xtreme. Everything on the menu is AYCE and for sushi mon, the 2 sided menu with a short list of appetizer list is just not enough value for $30.

This location being only a few miles from our house, I was eager to find a dependable neighborhood sushi joint.  The waitresses were nice enough when we first arrived.  There were no tables available so they told us to get started at the bar and that we'd be able to move to a table once one became available.  We ordered a few pieces of nigiri sushi while at the bar and then a table became available.  Once seated our order came out and we got all sorts of things we hadn't even ordered.  We ate them since we got AYCE and weren't being charged per piece but I was wondering if that was the norm?  After the nigiri we ordered a couple half orders of rolls and that's when the service slowed WAAAAAY down.  We were left alone for a good 15 minutes.  This is a small restaurant and we were sitting right by the register where the waitresses were constantly gathering.  There was no excuse for how hard it was to get any one of the three waitresses' attention.  I had no idea there was a one hour time limit (I just read about it on some other review below).  I was full way before the hour limit but what if I wasn't?  They wasted 15 minutes of my one hour by ignoring us!  The quality of sushi was so-so.  It wasn't awful but it wasn't great either.  The fish didn't seem super fresh but is anything super fresh in this desert?  At the end of our meal hubby said he wouldn't be back.  I don't know what other sushi joints are near Summerlin so I can't quite say never...yet.  I chose to give this place 3 stars but really I think 2.5 would be more accurate."

Fish & Chip....chips?! I just couldn't pass that up.\n\nMy lunch began right away with a hot bowl of miso soup that warmed me up, even though the temperature outside was hardly anywhere near 50 degrees. The soup was good, and I liked seeing seaweed strips and little cubes of tofu floating around than just plain miso. \n\nThe Fish & Chip arrived on a large tray. At first glance it looked like a lot of food, but sometimes the gut knows more than the stomach. Allow me break down my order:\n\n+Fish: I was expecting an actual piece of fish tempura, but I instead received nuggets. The sauce that accompanies those nuggets had a subtle sweetness, but I could tell it was diluted. Tempura dipping sauce might've been a better choice. \n\n+Salmon Skin Roll: I've never eaten a salmon skin roll before, so I'm unsure if it's supposed to have an unusual \"burnt\" taste. I might need to develop an acquired palate for that roll.\n\n+Edamame: Aside from the soup, this was my favorite thing about the meal. Really. \n\n+Tamago: This was OK, but then again I don't normally eat tamago at Japanese restaurants.\n\n+Coleslaw: Didn't care for the shredded cabbage bathing in dressing.\n\n+Chip(s): There weren't any. Makes me wonder if this special should even be called \"Fish & Chip\".\n\nAlthough I cleaned off the plates of edamame, fish, tamago, and salmon skin roll, I was still hungry. The salmon collar was still calling out to me, but I had to pass on giving that a try because I wasn't satisfied with my order. I guess you sometimes get what you pay for. \n\nService was on the slow side even though it was well past the usual lunchtime hours. They hardly came by to see how I was doing, but I think they're the type that just waits and sees if you need anything."

We had rounds of the shrimp, sweet shrimp, yellowtail and tuna that I was content with. The Dragon Roll was also nicely made, not too saucy and a lot of eel, just the way I like it. It takes a while for the orders to roll out if you aren't sitting at the bar, but that's like every sushi place. For the side of town that it is on, I think it is a good destination.

But what I've noticed is that, the first order is always REALLY FATTY and tasty, but as you order more and more, it just gets less and less fatty, to the point where the taste of salmon is gone. I don't know why that happens, but I have noticed that every time I've been there (about 5+ times).\n\nIn the end, I still go to this place every time I go to Vegas because it's just such a good deal and it's good quality sushi for the price you pay.

This looks to be a trend since Danica L. did report Sushi Tachi, owned by Sushimon has quality slipping as well. If its quality control, its understandable.

I was surprised by the variety of the sushi, appetizers, and dessert to pick from!\nThen they were not pre-made at all!  they make it right front of you once you order it.. depends on how many orders or how busy they are.. it takes about 5 minutes to get your order! Hey! c'mon! five minutes? That's so quick!\nquality and freshness of the fish... wow... that's another jaw dropping situation.\nI don't know how they afford all that!\nVery fresh.. tasty.. good quality of sushi!\n\nI know they were fresh.. and good.. because I also have a great knowledge of sushi by working at the sushi restaurant for so many years.\nYou can have my word on it! I promise you, you won't be disappointed if you like sushi.\nGo down to Sushi-mon once you are in Las Vegas!\nThey are cheap, fresh, and very tasty!\nIt will make your belly very happy!\n\nThank you for great service once again, Sushi-mon!"

I am an occasional sushi snacker, but rarely can I get enough value from AYCE to go that route.  At $29 for dinner, the value is hard to obtain here, so this is a review of the non-sushi items. \n\nI have had teriyaki chicken, udon, and tempura, and they have been meh. The chicken is always dry. However, the value is pretty incredible. For $10  I get more food than I could ever hope to eat: miso soup, salad, pasta salad, 6 pieces of tempura, California roll and teriyaki chicken. Crazy! Even if you don't eat one of the items, you're still getting a nice deal. \n\nService is always efficient, perhaps a little stand-offish, but with a little nudging, friendly. Solid effort."

This all-you-can-eat sushi place was recommended to me by one of my old co-workers in Vegas, and from that day forward, we became regulars - regulars to the point that the host, waitresses, and sushi chefs knew us and knew what we were going to order for our first round!  I didn't become broke because of my horrible gambling ways in Vegas - it was because of the frequent visits to Sushi Mon!!!  Damn you Sushi Mon!!!  Damn you for being so damn good!!! *shakes fists*\n\nWe LOVE this all-you-can eat sushi place where they make the sushi to order - it's not a buffet style place.  As Sushi Mon professional gorgers, we know not to order everything all at once the first time around - you have to know how to space out the ordering and the eating - otherwise you'll become full really quick!  The fish is fresh, the nigiri sushi fish to rice ratio is perfect (not too much rice), and the flavor of some of the sauces they use on some of the nigiri sushi and sushi rolls are amazing!  The service is good - sometimes the language barrier becomes an obstacle, but the food comes out quick.\n\nBe sure to order what you can eat - they charge you for whatever you leave behind.  It hasn't happened to us though.\n\nI can't wait to go back again!!!"

You can sit at the bar or the tables, I've done both and there isnt a huge difference because the staff is great and attentive.  What I love about this place is virtually everything on the menu is fair game.  You can come here without even loving sushi and be fine because staff rushes out orders of gyoza, shrimp termpura, teriyaki chicken, shumai etc.  If you're at a table they also take your sushi orders, but if youre at the bar, the chef does of course.  The sushi is amazingly fresh and does not disappoint.  The chefs are fast and give a good fish to rice ratio (unlike other all you can eat places).  For dinner, you also get one order toro and amaebi, which you will probably never get at any other all you can eat place.  The nigiri is extremely fresh.  I order a ton of that.  But they also have hand rolls, your basic cut rolls, and even specialty roles.  Yes an all you can eat place where you can order a huge variety specialty rolls.  Try their  achi chi roll ( salmon on top of shrimp tempura roll with a spicy sauce) and mambo roll (yellowtail on a lettuce spicy tuna roll) and of course volcano roll. Additionally, you can order half rolls (4 pieces) allowing you to try lots of different rolls.  This place is so far beyond any other all you can eat sushi restaurant its amazing.  The only downside is lunch is only 45 minutes (dinner is an hour) and its a good 15-20 minutes from the strip.  Even so, it is well worth it."

Just when I thought it couldn't get any better.\n \nMy favorites:\n1) Miso Soup\n2) Albacore tuna\n3) Yellowtail\n4) Super white tuna\n5) Shrimp tempura\n6) Tiger Roll- shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, spicy tuna\n7) Rainbow roll- California roll wrapped in tuna, shrimp, salmon,  yellowtail, & white fish topped with smelt eggs\n \nThe tiger roll is a must. It's texturally balanced and has an awesome flavor combination.  The super white tuna is dressed with the most amazing ponzu sauce....  I have yet to find one that comes close. Sadly, they don't serve strawberry mochi anymore which was one of the best I've tasted. All in all, this is my favorite sushi place and I'm happy they were my first ;)"

While I was waiting for my friend to arrive, I had the Green Tea Dream Smoothie, it was really good, but it could have used a more smoother consistency.

Wife & I were visiting from Hawaii and we have a lot of good Japanese restuarants and sushi bars in Honolulu.   Haven't been to Sushi Mon in over two years. Man, something must have happened since our last visit here, because the quality, servuce and food  in this place was very disappointing.  An soon as we walked in, there was a foul odor like they might have had a sewer overflow problem recently.  We were looking forward to some good sushi, so decided to stay. Sat down and waitress came over to take drink orders, I asked about the Japanese beers if they had any REAL Japanese beer from Japan.  She spoke very condescendingly and said that \" All Japanese beer are from Japan!\" which is not true - it's all right on the labels.  Kirin, Sappora and Asahi all have associate breweries in US or Canada, but a few of the true imports are available in certain restuarants.  She asked if I wanted the regular bottle or the large bottle and when I asked her how many ounces were in the large bottle, she couldn't answer that.\nWe ended up with a different waitress and she was very polite and friendly.  As usual, we went with the All You Can Eat.  The edamame was either old or overcooked.  The Hamachi, Scallops, Uni and Ikura was dry and dark (and this is an understatment) meaning that these items have probably been sitting out since lunchtime or worse.  My wife ordered the Tako and it was so hard and rubbery that she couldn't even bite it in half.  I looked over at the main sushi maker behind the sushi counter and he saw me and looked down - he knew of our disappointment and couldn't even look me in the eye.  Will never eat there again and will tell all our friends from Hawaii about this disappointing change in their quality.\nFunny thing is the next day, my wife spoke with a friend who lives in Vegas and this friend told her that they don't eat there anymore either for the same reasons."

We kept ordering away and the food kept coming out without skipping a beat.\n\nEnded my meal with green tea ice cream which was among the best I've tasted and I left satisfied and happy."

We tried ordering appetizers but he said he's doesn't do that. We had to wait for the waitress to come by and ask for drinks. The roll pieces were really big and thick, so that being said I was filled up fast and didn't eat half of the roll. When she came by she asked why I didn't eat it, which was weird. But I told her. \nAnother thing is I didn't get my edamame until a little before the check.\nOverall it was an okay experience.... I don't think I'd eat here though."

They offer an AYCE menu, which is $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner, but you can also opt for a la carte sushi. Prices vary for a la carte depending on what your order. Just remember, if you do a la carte, you're not allowed to share with an AYCE patron in your party. If you're hungry and want everything and anything on the menu, AYCE is the way to go. \n\nThroughout the years, their quality and flavors have gone down. Their service is a hit or miss depending on the time you come in. I live down the street so this was our spot to go to. On our last visit however, things were lacking.\n\nThe seaweed salad has gotten really watery and salty. This is usually my favorite appetizer to order, but this time it was hard to eat. The garlic edamame was awful. They overcooked the garlic and now our edamame was just bitter. My bf ordered the tiger roll and his reaction to the presentation was \"it's not made with love anymore.\" The avocado looked like it had been smeared over the top of the roll instead of cut nicely and placed on top. And it was an overkill with the imitation crab inside. Same thing with the lemon roll. Really sloppy presentation and too much imitation crab. The nigiri we ordered was really good though. Not too much rice and the fish was nice and plump. And I love their yellowtail collar. If it's on the specials menu, order one!! It's tender, moist and grilled to perfection. \n\nAll in all, this isn't a bad sushi joint. I'm just hoping that we just dined in on an off night because I really do like this spot."

But Overall, I did have a good experience at this place. \n\nSome friends and I were running some last minute errands in Las Vegas and we were way off the strip to take care of them. We were also quite hungry and just looking for some decent food we saw along the way. It was either Sushi or Greek. Everyone felt like Sushi so as soon as I saw a decent Sushi place, I said \"let's go to THAT one!\". \n\nSo we parked and headed inside. This place is TINY as heck. We luckily got seated fast but then a line started to form immediately after us. We definitely lucked out! I can only imagine how long you must have to wait to be seated when there are so few seats in this joint.\n\nThe service was not bad. But they did forget TWO of our orders. But the sushi was very good. We didn't opt for the All You Can Eat because there's no way I could eat $27 worth of sushi all by myself. I wasn't THAT hungry. I instead just ordered 2 rolls which came out to less than $15 total and I was a happy camper. The rolls were delicious and satisfying. \n\nThis place is busy and seems very popular among all. It must be a rare good sushi place in Vegas and so that's why everyone comes here. In my personal opinion, it's very hard to find good Asian food in Vegas. I have not been very impressed but this place is the first to semi impress me. I would actually come back again if I felt like driving off the strip for some sushi."

If your getting rolls I would also recommend ordering half rolls unless u knw of a specific one you really like and know you'll finish with no problems...\n\nWe sat at the bar and service was great.  The sushi guy was always checking to see how we were doing with a smile...\n\nOk, onto the food!  I think I had to be rolled outta the place, everything was so goowd!  \n\nStarters: Green shell mussels are a MUST!!!  I'm usually not a fan but they were really good!\nDynamite was just ok and a lil oily...\nMiso soup, tasty and had good amount of tofu.  You can order it with shrimp heads if you want a seafood miso...I think it's alright but my friend loves it...\nShrimp tempura...gotta love it!  Serves hot and perfectly fried\n\nFor the nigiri everything was so fresh!  We had garlic salmon, yellowtail, and mackerel (my favorite...fishy I knw but yum!). Order was done quick and don't be afraid to ask for any sauce or extras like jalape\u00f1os like we did...(not that it didn't taste great, I just always add extra!   =)\n\nOnto the rolls!  We had the 911 roll...like a spicy tuna roll on crack!  Doesn't seem hot when you put it in your mouth, but like 3.2 seconds later it hits ya and your looking for high quality H2O!   =p\n\nJJ roll...tempura, avocado, asparagus, cream cheese...tasty!!!\n\nAnd the Sexy Girl Roll...hard time remembering what's in this one...shrimp, scallions, crab meat, avocado maybe?  Very good!...BUT!  This is why I recommend ordering half rolls till u knw what u really like...it was towards the end and was SO hard finishing, \n\nI did (somehow!) save enough room for desert which is included...choice between green tea, red bean and tempura ice cream.  And vanilla and strawberry mochi balls.  We had strawberry mochi balls, great way to end meal!  And red bean ice cream!  Yummo!  \n\nGreat way to get GOOD sushi!

There was a line when we got there and the wait was about 40 minutes.  We weren't in a rush so we killed time by checking out the surrounding stores.  \n\nWhen we finally got our seats, we immediately told the waitress we wanted the AYCE sushi (all of us love sushi).  It was about $26 at the time.  The one thing that we didn't know going in was that you only have 1 hour for AYCE.  We ending up coming a second time and ordered a lot of plates at the beginning.  When we had eaten about half of the plates, we would order again.  That way, we could eat more and not get full as fast from waiting if you order one plate at a time.  I tried most of their specialty rolls (dragon, caterpillar, tiger, volcano, athena, etc.).  All delicious.  If they have it in stock, you can order sweet shrimp and salmon collar too.  One order per person though, even if you are doing AYCE.  The tempura ice cream was a nice dish to finish off the meal.  We all got our money's worth for sure (and then some).\n\nIf you're ever in Las Vegas and have a craving for sushi, definitely consider coming here.  There's another place called 808 Sushi that's similar to Sushi Mon, but I don't think there's a time limit.  I'll have to check it out the next time I visit."

Stays open 'til 2 am so perfect for those who are craving sushi this late without having to go all the way to Chinatown where other restaurants stay open late as well.\n\nAll you can eat is a bit pricey for such a small joint.  I believe it was close to being $30 unlike the $20 I'm used too in other all you can eat sushi places.  You can never go wrong with baked mussels. They serve pretty big nigiris, but it's just ok on the taste factor. I highly recommend the volcano roll and jala jala roll. But if you ordered all you can eat, just order half the original quantity of the rolls so you can try all their other rolls as well which are pretty good too.

If you dont like rice order the more expensive plate of sashimi instead. \n\nWith that said, they have an extensive amount of rolls to choose from.

Sushi is super fresh, with nice fish to rice ratio where you are actually eating fish, not rice. If the uni and fresh shrimp is done right, the place is 5 stars in my book.  This was my favorite place until Goyemon opened up, which I only prefer due to location, but is well worth the drive if you want to pig out on ayce mochi ice cream too."

Usually one of my favorite places to go because a few of the chefs and servers are really friendly and it is close to my house. I have recently changed my schedule and have to go later in the evening which means longer waits to get a table. Along with this comes bad service. As it gets later the better chefs here get off and they have a bunch of new people that are not as friendly or good behind the bar. They also recently changed managers and promoted a server to that position, which is not a good change. What irritates me in particular is one waitress who usually takes over service of the sushi bar when she comes in and she would rather talk to coworkers and hide in the back then actually take care of customers. I have been a loyal customer for years and the food is always good but the service here is getting to the point where I am starting to look for another ayce sushi joint. So if you want great service this is not the place for you."

Convinced me so well I got a new item from his suggestions. Very smiley and I love it. Tries to keep a conversation with you. \n\nCurrently eating their AYCE. I've been to multiple multiple AYCE. I usually vary by options and prices. Option wise they have a handful, not as much as the ones I usually go to near UNLV but this their options are decent. Prices are the same as any other one. By the way, I am eating for 1, so sitting at the bar was my best choice. Thursday night at 10 pm, not so crowded. Music playing, not too loud not too low. Servers, I'm at the bar so they don't really serve me but are attendant. Better than others in my opinion. \n\n\nThe reason why I wanted to give 4 stars in the first place was the small size of nigiri that they serve. A lot smaller than anywhere I've been. Even in San Francisco. And because, I'm guessing a new chef that he was mentoring behind him, kept staring making me feel uncomfortable. Not going to name names and leave it at that.

I told the hostess that they weren't on, she just said, \"oh, ok.\" anyways, after a 2 hr wait in the car in the cold, the hostess told us it would be only another 45 minutes. Waited another hour and finally left and went to Sushi Koma. It has been 3 weeks and I am still waiting for a phone call to tell us our table is ready at Sushi Mon. \n\nI had also gone to Goyemon (a sushi mon related joint) about a week ago and they still had the texting waitlist system which worked perfectly. Not sure what is happening at sushi mon on maryland."

I yelped it, and it looked try worthy.\n\nThis place is not bad at all.  You can't beat the price for all you can eat sushi in Vegas.  I was seated at the bar and was given a brief explanation of how the all you can eat works.  The waitress suggested that I order small because whatever I don't eat, I will have to pay for in addition to the all you can eat price.  Also, you have to eat the rice and the fish (sounds obvious, but I do know of people who would hide the rice and just eat the fish).  Also, you can order half rolls (4 pieces instead of 8), so you can eat more of a variety.  There is also a 1 hour time limit... so no pulling Man v. Food all day here.  \n\nI ordered and ordered because I was determined to get my money's worth.  I had the sweet shrimp (only 1 order per person), snow crab hand rolls, crab sticks, garlic tuna (my least favorite), halibut, some kind of variation on the a shrimp roll with avocado, more snow crab, the hottest 911 roll I have ever had (I couldn't feel my tongue-- it was awesome), and more halibut.  I was stuffed, but determined to finish my last hand roll when I was asked by Jun (one of the sushi chefs) if I wanted anything else.  I told him I was tapping out.  I had fought the good fight... then he offers dessert.  I'm not one to turn down sugar, but I don't think I could have looked at more food much less ate it.  \n\nMy bill was about $30 with my plum wine.  The only reason I couldn't give this place 5 starts is because I've had fresher fish elsewhere at an all you can eat.  Of course, this was in Cali."

They have daily/nightly specials written out so make sure you take a peek at the board before you order.  As far as AYCE goes, they're not bad.

You get what you pay for without the unnecessary frills.  \n\nWhenever my friends and I come here, we try to score a seat at the sushi bar.

I've been coming here since the advent of AYCE sushi in this town. Though I've ventured off to try other places, I somehow always find myself back here. It sort of has a \"Cheersish\" vibe for me.\n\nThe main reason I love it here is that I know I will get fresh, consistent product. I have never received anything less than that. At a lot of places in town, you may receive old or frozen fish which is very disconcerting. Sushi-mon somehow always has beautifully fresh fish. \n\nIn addition, they are FAST! I order something (in most cases, LOTS of things) and it's on the table in 5 minutes. Sushi-mon chefs seem to get a kick out of the people who order ridiculous amounts of food, so they send it out as quick as they can. \n\nSpeaking of the staff, they are as friendly as can be. Fransisco is my \"go-to\" server and he always takes care of us. Paul, the busser/runner, knows us well too and always keeps our drinks filled and our table clean. \n\nBut on to the food...\n\nAs I said, we usually order our fair share of nigiri: hamachi, garlic tuna, aji, hirame, hotate with yuzu...but our favorites are the hokkigai (surf clam) and sake (salmon). I've never had surf clam as fresh and delicious as theirs. If you've tried surf clam somewhere else and hated it, try it here. Trust me.\n\nThe rolls are no joke as well. Some favorites are the Yebisu, Stacey and Hurricane roll, but I've yet to try one I didn't like. Another tip: you can get most rolls in \"hand roll\" form. I like to get yumyum scallops, california and spider rolls that way. Also, try some baked green mussels. They're creamy and briny, yet sweet and unctuous. If you're still hungry after all that, get the Frying Jason roll. It's delicious, but it'll put you over the edge. Their side dishes (miso soup, tempura shrimp, sesame chicken, calamari) are terrific as well. \n\nOk. That's enough. This review is making me hungry. I'll see y'all there!\n:::insert Cheers theme song here:::"

I believe it's Japanes owned and often the staff are foreign exchange students going to UNLV. \n\nThe service has always been good, and the sushi a great value. Love the late night all-you-can-eat. Kind of funny how they have to over emphasize the \"rules\" of all you can eat, but I guess it comes with the territory.\n\nI get back to Vegas 3-4 times a year and always make sure I have a car to visit Sush-Mon and the buffet and M Casino.\n\nI have lived in Hawaii and now Seattle and I still think and crave Sushi-Mon in the desert of Vegas more often than the sushi establishments in these oceanside States."

It's not going to blow you away with it's superior service.\n\nI don't know about you guys, but I really don't think that matters.\n\nIf you're getting AYCE Sushi, you already have an idea of what kind of sushi you want, and what your preference is.\n\nAll the server's I've seen at Sushimon are good at getting the food out, and keeping the drinks full.\n\nYou could go to some dirty place in the middle of a bad neighborhood and get Sushi for $4-5 cheaper, sure.\n\nBut Sushimon offers almost their entire menu on their AYCE and All-you-can-eat Dessert as well. \n\nI know a lot of places mark off menu items and only offer you one dessert.\n\nThings I LOVE from Sushimon\n\nNigiri:\n- Hamachi (Yellowtail)\n- Salmon\n- Super White Tuna\n- Unagi\n\nOther offerings:\n- Hamachi Collar(most places don't offer this, and they sometimes run out, but if they have, order it!)\n- Salmon Collar\n-All the rolls(and 1/2 rolls for almost all of them if you want to try the roll without getting too full, again something most places don't offer)\n-Uni(Sea Urchin) (one per person)\n-Ama Ebi(sweet Shrimp) (also one per person)\n\nDessert(AYCE)\n-Mochi Ice Cream (Strawberry/Vanilla)\n-Green Tea, Red Bean, and Lychee Ice Cream\n- Tempura Ice cream\n\nSure you could in theory find a cheaper place than this, in a more \"glamorous\" location, but if I'm gonna shell out $20+ for a meal, I don't mind paying a little bit more knowing that my meal is going to be good. Sushimon offers you a large menu to choose from, speedy service, and most importantly, consistency. I've been here at least a dozen times, and haven't once had a bad experience. \n\nIn case anyone is wondering, they DON'T do call ahead seating, so you have to arrive in person to get your party on the list."

Despite sitting at the sushi bar on a night that wasn't full, it took forever to get sushi (they had 5 chefs working). The dishes piled up since the waiters never stopped, and I had to literally grab them to put in orders as they ran by since waving did nothing.   \n\nDry hamachi and salmon kama, sloppy looking rolls and nigiri, smaller pieces of fish and they don't seem to put wasabi in the nigiri anymore. Spicy scallop hand roll that literally had 2 pieces of bay scallop mixed in with a lot of imitation crab, and also wasn't spicy at all.

Very friendly and fast sushi chefs. \n\nTip: come for a late lunch (before 4pm) and enjoy AYCE sushi and food for only $21.95. \n\nWarning: stay away from the 9-1-1 roll unless you can handle extreme amounts of jalape\u00f1o heat. This roll may put a speed bump on your sushi experience."

The place closes at 2am and will accept late munchers until 1am, which for me, is such a great thing! \n\nThe food is great in my opinion. I often order nigiris (salmon belly, yellowtail belly, etc) and boy, they are just so buttery and creamy in my tummy! They are often given to you as fast as they can because this place can get quite busy.\n\nFood taste: 4 of 5\nAmbiance: 4 of 5\nStaff Attitude: 4.5 of 5\n\n\nThe only thing I really hate about Sushi Mon is that it is so cramped, which means longer wait for you and your party of however many to get seated. Often, party of 2 gets seated quite fast, but anything over 4 just gets ridiculous from waiting 40 mins to 1 hour. So, be prepared to wait and mingle around Smith's, Dollar Tree, or Toyko Discount before you get seated."

Now they have decided to use a new seating system that is no longer first come first serve. We were a group of two and kept getting passed over for groups of 4-6 that came way later than us. Sushi Mon you let us down and that's sad cause we always made a trip to eat here every time we visit and always recommend you to any friends who was visiting. We waited over an hour and 1/2, when your text said 40mins. Double sad that we left when you 3 empty seats open at the bar. At the two hour mark you sent a text and called but we had long gone since your hostess was rude and just didn't care."

            "review": "I have such a hard time talking about this place. It's not my favorite place to go to but then it again it has some items that I absolutely love there. So let's talk about what I normally order and we'll go from there.\n\nSalmon collar: Yepp, you read it right, salmon collar. This is the only place in Vegas that I know of that has this dish and when it's done correctly, it's so fabulous. Salmon collar is the cheek of the salmon. So you get this salmon flavor fatty part that is just so tender and literally melts in your mouth. It's done with a miso glaze here and again, when it's right (not too salty, which is usually most of the time) is just delicious. I swear  by this dish with a side of white rice, very asian of me. I will admit that I will come here just for this dish.\n\nGreen salad: Oh yah. I don't know what is in the dressing but it's one of my favorite dressing. I usually order a side of it to take home because I'll dress all my salads with this dressing if I could. So bright and refreshing.\n\nShrimp head miso: It's not on the menu so you gotta tell them shrimp head miso. It just adds just the right about of brine and salt to the miso. You don't have to eat the shrimp head but it's worth the try. You're in Vegas, right?\n\nNebakyaki udon: Served in a clayish pot and pretty darn good. I love udon but there's something different about it that makes me crave it. And when I crave udon, this is the udon that will cure my cravings. The only thing that I still find soooooooooooo odd and needs to be changed is, you CANNOT have this to go. I guess it's that hard for the owners to order big to go cups. I hope changes soon because I would have this soup more often if I could take it home.\n\nAll baked rolls: Okay, I going to let you all in on a small secret, I don't eat anything raw. I know, I know, don't judge me. But the good news is I can tell you that about the cooked stuff. No? Still not a good excuse? Well, deal with it. But, again, all the baked sushi is good there. Sometimes you just want to be unhealthy and break the cycle and have some cream cheese on my sushi. Speaking of, try the Frying Jason roll, one of my favorites here.\n\nNow, the not so fun part, SERVICE. Where is the customer service? This place is the worst when it comes to service, minus the sushi chefs. ALL the servers there are so incompetent. They never seem to know whose section is whose. We get asked for water at least twice, I guess it's better than nothing, no one comes to check on you and you HAVE TO FIND anyone if you want to order more food, especially when you have the all you can eat. I wish they were just hire people that knew how to be servers. You're job is to be helpful, bring food to the table and check up on your guest, is it that hard for you to do? You're not in a fine dining restaurant, can you at least manage to be helpful?\n\nIf this place didn't have the few items that I can't seem to find at any other sushi place, I wouldn't come here. But, if you're lucky and come when there's no lunch or dinner rush, you'll find this place to be just that, okay.\n\nCiao and until next time, happy eating everyone :)"

Reasonable prices for the quantity you receive; their AYCE deal is especially good! I ordered the nigiri, assuming there would be 4-6 pieces, as is standard, but there were only two. Bummer. No complaints on the hand roll and the rock 'n roll I ordered, but a note on the edamame: it was dried out and pruny, with way too much salt on top. It looked like they baked it instead of steaming or boiling it! Just a small annoyance, but it took down the overall experience, especially as I love my edamame."

We frequently dine here almost weekly and have always experienced great service until lastnight. We had a party of 7 (not Asian size if you know what I mean.) We were given a wait time of 25 min. But Waited over 1 hour before two 4 seater tables opened up at the same time. Starving and relieved that finally we're going in, two people drove right up, no  waitimg list needed for them and this hostess (short girl with blond dyed, black roots) automatically offers them one of those tables and tries to squeeze us in the other?? That's where I lost my mind!  Especially because there was a 2 seater opened for them and we needed both tables. This hostess refused to put both tables together for us and rudely told us we'd have to wait 15 minutes longer till more tables open up (4 separate parties had to leave first =8 seats still. ) WTH? When we were done, one of those two tables were still unused. So Dumb! If it wasn't for your waitress' making a way for us, you would've lost our Tip let alone our business lastnight!

Although some of the rolls are the same as Goyemon, Sushi Mon does not have the awesome appetizers and desserts that the other restaurant does. \n\nThe quality of fish is the same, the service is better, but the variety is lacking. If you ignore these minor complaints, the difficulty in picking up the nigiri was the major problem of the night. The ones that had a sauce splashed on top fell apart too easily. Instead of drizzling it lightly on the fish, they put it directly on the rice which caused it to loosen up on contact. \n\nThe rolls are nothing particularly special, so nigiri is definitely the way to go. The nice large pieces of fish placed on a proportionate piece of rice was perfection. \n\nI didn't know that they use the same stamp card as Goyemon, so if your waitress ask if you have a card give them that card. I looked at the one she gave me and asked if I could just get my Goyemon stamped, but they will not combine. Be prepared and just add on to your preexisting one."

I was definitely a skeptic, but thought it was more than decent after our AYCE meal.  \n\nThe fish to rice ratio for the nigiri were perfect, especially for all you can eat.  Small cut of fish and the proper amount of rice to make this one-bite, as it was meant for, that much more satisfying.  That is my one pet peeve about AYCEs, is they make massive portions and 2 rolls max, you'll be stuffed with just on rice.  Not here...\n\nThe fact that they offer salmon belly was a big score for my guests this evening.  $26.95 for dinner, just ordering a few uni nigiri and salmon belly already paid for itself.  We all opted for AYCE, so sharing was really convenient and allowed us to try more things on the menu.\n\nhighlights for me- \n\ntako poke- though a little chewy with light flavoring, more of a ponzu taste was a refreshing change.\nsalmon belly- marbled like crazy throughout, but that made it that much more buttery\nhamachi kama- fully cooked yellowtail collar bone with a side of ponzu and chopped scallion.  I always find this dish so satisfying to pick at.\nuni- nice delicate pieces gently laid over a bite size amount of rice. The seaweed wrapped the whole rice with the leftover stuck left out to the shape of number '6'.  Rich and buttery, YUM!\nred bean ice cream and green tea ice cream- scoops of heaven, hints of matcha and hints of red beans.  Not the best quality, but definitely not too shabby. \n\nThe albacore, sashimi salad, red snapper were all good too.  The extensive menu included specials for the night, lots of side dishes and the nigiri was the most impressive for me.  \n\nWe ordered but one roll to share amongst the four of us and the sexy girl is a no go.  Stuffed with the California roll as the base, a little piece of the tempura shrimp and bits of scallops on top over too much whatever sauce and whole load of tempura sprinkles.  \n\nMy one other complaint was the temperature was set way too high for the amount of people in the restaurant. We were situated in a corner with the larger table, under the vent and the heat was so uncomfortable, that the blast of cold air from the ocassional opened door was more than welcomed.  \n\nTowards the end of our meal, the service got super slow and ordering became more of a waiting game, so we settled for our dessert a little sooner.  \n\nSushi snob, I am not, but this was a decent sushi joint.  I haven't enjoyed much sushi out here, for the fact of being disappointed in comparison to Hawaii and Cali sushi.  \n\nI'm super excited that we have this place in Henderson."

We are disappointed that we have to find a new sushi place to come to, but this place is definitely not it anymore.\n\nSushi Mon changed ownership recently, and it really shows.  The cute Japanese lady is no longer at the cash register.  The new ownership charges the same price, but everything good about this place has gone.\n\nThe nigiri now comes with huge pieces of rice.  If you are a rice connoisseur, this place is for you.  It's a shame what the new management is trying to pull.  On top of that, the fish is not fresh.\n\nMy wife ordered a spicy scallop handroll, and it was overflowing with imitation crab.  I argued with the sushi chef, and he opened the handroll up and showed us the 2 pieces of scallop hidden in the bed of imitation crab.  Really??\n\nThe presentation of the salmon skin handroll looked like a kindergarten art project.  \n\nThe sushi chefs are inexperienced and can't get the sauce right.  The rolls are either too salty or falling apart."

We were going to get the all you can eat special but you only get an hour to eat and after looking at their menu, we thought it would be cheaper to go the a la carte route.  I got the screaming orgasm and calamari appetizers.  Both were tasty and I loved the screaming orgasm sauce.  My husband got the salmon teriyaki, which was not the best, but not bad either.  I got the chicken teriyaki and was pretty good, not the best.  But, for food value, this place rocks.  Our entrees came with miso soup, small salad, tempura, and a small california roll!! Our bill ended up being just at $40, not too shabby if you ask me.  I will definitely return."

We ordered specials on the chalk board first, because they are always fresh and good. The yellowtail collar appetizer was great. I felt like I was back in japan in a small izakaya. \n\nWe only order nigiri sushi because we love fish. Seared tuna, seared salmon and fresh scallop were our favorites of the day. Their fish is always very fresh and as good as being in japan. They sometimes get rice either not cooked right or the chef did not roll it tight enough, and rice can fall apart. However , we hit the good night and all nigiri made were near perfect.\n\nWe tried other AYCE sushi places, but this place is the best among them!"

Tonight, I finally have that opportunity.  I suggested this place to a friend of mine for some drinks and Japanese food.\n\nI arrived at the location and to my surprise, it was empty!  No line, no waiting, no headache.  SCORE!  I chose to sit at a table of two rather than the sushi bar.  the tables are a little close from the others, however, I've learned to deal with that from my frequent past visits.  The servers are clean, wear all black and really pays attention to the need of their customers.  I appreciate them coming around often to fill up my water, or clearing any plates and debris from the table.  Makes me feel special :)\n\nTonight my friend got a $10 Teriyaki chicken dinner plate.  Added was my meal:  A bowl of salted edamame, an appetizer of the Yellowtail collar, a bowl of the California salad, a larger Sapporo beer and a large hot sake.   Everything mentioned above came to $52.00 with tax and ample tip.  The edamame was lightly salted and not overpowering.  It came out so warm, I was in heaven!  My favorite thing, hands down, about Sushimon is the Yellowtail or Hamachi collar.  Literally, a grilled piece of the fish collar area, close to the head.  The collar is packed with fish meat, marbleized and full of smokey flavor goodness!  This dish is served with a lemon wedge, a little fish roe and a soy-vinegar dipping sauce.  I literally take my time on this dish.  It's so good!  Every bite offers such a euphoric experience for me, I became super sad on the last bite LOL. It was the first time I've tried the California salad.  This was AH-MAZE-ING!  Start off with a spring mix accompanied with a mustard/ginger dressing.  On the top of the salad is sliced avocado, yum, shrimp and crab meat-lots of it!  It was soo filling and so fresh.  This is a must try in my book.  The crab meat was everywhere, fanned out shrimp and long slivers of avocado.  Every bite was better than the rest!  \n\nI had a great night here as I always tend to do.  Lots of great food, great service and an intimate space that allows you to really enjoy the company around you.  Definitely need to check this place out.  It's in the middle of a busy part of town and super accessible.  You will not be disappointed!!!"

            "review": "Sushi Mon definitely lives up to its hype. A couple of friends recommended this place to me as a must stop in Vegas. I was reassured this is the place to be as soon as I heard Japanese coming from the chefs.  Can't get more authentic than that, right? \n\nWe came in right at opening 11:45am, even skipped breakfast to make sure we have plenty of room for the raw fish. There were only a couple of others waiting anxiously for them to open up. We had the option of sitting at the bar or table, went with the latter to accommodate our group of 4. Our server came up immediately to get our drinks started. We decided to go with the AYCE sushi. You can't go wrong paying 21.95 for good quality fish.  I decided to start off with the salmon belly, which was melt-in-your-mouth good.  I would highly recommend getting this belly if you see it on their special menu. They ran out in just 10 minutes.  Everything else was delicious and fresh!\n\nRestaurant filled up quickly but there wasn't much of a wait until we left the restaurant around 1. I was also worried at the 45 minute time limit they have posted everywhere. How can anyone eat in 45 minutes when you have to wait for your food every time you put an order in? But luckily this rule was not enforced.  I noticed that there are plenty of people ordering from the lunch menu.  That's something I'd consider if I were a local. But since I'm not, I had to take advantage of the all you can eat menu.  \n\nAnother huge plus of this restaurant is the insane 2 am closing time. I don't think I'd crave raw fish past midnight, but Vegas never sleeps, right? There is another location closer to the strip on Sahara. I accidentally came to this location because it came up on my Yelp search. But my local friend said that the other location is the original restaurant, and can get more crowded.  I'd have to check out the other one on my next trip.  I highly recommend this place! Friendly staff + reasonable price + great food = one happy returning customer!"

Skeptic to sit at the bar due to my unpleasant, first experience at Hikari, I was surprised to find that there are sushi chefs out there at AYCE places that attentively listen, can figure when you're ready to order again, and make the orders at a quick pace. Thumbs up to the sushi chefs. Their cuts were clean, thick, and perhaps even overpowering compared to the rice. \n\nSushi Mon's menu is actually quite large in comparison to other AYCE places, specifically their specials menu. I was pleasantly surprised to find Takoyaki on the Appetizers section; that's something you don't usually see nowadays. They also had AYCE Salmon Belly which got me screaming inside with pure joy! Bless! You can also customize your sushi when you talk to the chef. I appreciated the fact that he let me go rice-less with my tamago. There aren't many places that do that for you. For some nigiri such as the scallops, I even added yum yum sauce just for the heck of it. You know, try new things. \n\nI would love to give this place the 5 stars that they deserve, but this sushi joint has one major downfall. \n\nThe waiters. \n\nSuper inattentive. It seems that whenever I need something from them (water, appetizers, dessert, the BILL), they're just never there. I had to literally hawk my eyes around the restaurant for the first available waiter to tell him my order before he goes back hiding in the kitchen. Several male waiters just kept walking to and from the kitchen, ignoring customers like me that needed assistance, even as I raised my voice and kept saying \"excuse me!\" \n\nHowever, it seems that for their friends that visited for the evening, their needs are met whenever they ask. There was literally a waiter right next to me that just kept ignoring my requests as his attention was on his friend who happened to be sitting right next to my group at the bar. Thanks for the service. I guess. \n\nDespite the hiccups with the restaurant's waiters, the food here is still solid enough to get me to come back. That is, after I finish my checklist of other AYCE sushi restaurants."

I am marking one star off because Athena roll was bland and 911 roll was not as spicy as advertised."

So I went there to try in my vegas trip (you know how hard you have to squeeze a quota out from the vegas buffets when you only stay there a few days) Then, I came out with a fat belly with high satisifation =)\n\n1st, their price is reasonable!! only $27 for all-you-can eat with all FRESH sushi!!! You can really tell the freshness of sashimi WORTH every penny you pay!! Unlike other sushi buffet, they give you cheaper fish to maintain their cost, sushi mon has really good sushi (or even better than some Jap rest)!!! The sauce with some sashimi give you a better taste or refreshment! I love their citrus sauce!!!!\n\n2nd, like all buffet, they'll remind you dun waste the food so you have to finish the rice. However, unlike other sushi buffet, their sushi rice is abit smaller than usual so that will give you more room to try other food. \n\n3rd, even though they limit your dining time to 45mins (dinner hours), but that's enough!! Because the chefs made it quick and won't waste your time!!! \n\n4th, all other hot dishes and appetizers are also delicious =)\n\nSo combine all these reasons, I went there twice on my 3days vegas trip.

They have \"all you can eat\" option, it's not super cheap but their menu is amazing, so it's fair. If you like Japanese food you'll go crazy here! And you can have more than one dessert if you pick \"all you can eat\", how awesome is that? The food is amazing, seriously.\n\nThe service is good too, the lady taking care of us was really nice and knowledgeable. They bring everything considerably fast and I got everything I ordered.\n\nThe only bad thing about the restaurant is that the tables are very close to one another so you don't have privacy and can't help but to listen to others people's conversations. \nI'm going back for sure, asap!"

Luckily lunch with a friend who works in the area happened to arise, so my reason to waste some gas to come here was justified at last!\n\nFirst off we arrived right when they opened at 11:45 AM and we were not the only ones waiting. About four other parties walked in the door at the same time as us. We were seated immediately at a two-person table and we let them know we would be doing the AYCE lunch special. \n\nI've heard really great things about Sushi Mon so I was hoping it would not disappoint. The restaurant itself is on the smallish side and decor is pretty much minimal and non-existent. Oh well, as long as the fish is good right? \n\nI skipped appetizers and went straight into the sushi. I figured I wouldn't fill myself up on anything but fish. Our server quickly took our order. \n\nNigiri:\nGarlic Tuna\nYum Yum Scallop\nSalmon \n\nAll were good, but my favorite was the Yum Yum Scallop. If I were to go back, this would be on the menu for a return trip.\n\nRolls:\n1/2 J.J. Roll - Lovely roll, really enjoyed the addition of asparagus and avocado.\nLemon Roll - My friend ordered this one and I had a piece, it was very fragrant and refreshing\nChubby (5 pieces) - Good roll, nothing spectacular, but well put together, the soybean paper around it is a nice change.\n\nHand-Rolls: Per usual I ordered a spicy tuna hand roll. I always do a sushi places. This one was tasty, so I actually had two. =o^-^o=\n\nOther:\nI did order the Poke bowl. It was okay, nothing special, but at least it was not overly-salted. I ended my meal with strawberry mochi ice cream - yummy! But so cold it hurt my teeth. But. That's just because I have sensitive teeth. Tee hee.\n\nOverall: \n\nI believe the \"hype\" is true. This place serves up GOOD, QUALITY sushi. And that is what matters when you are eating raw fish. Nothing tasted strange or wrong to me. The fish was the perfect temperature. The presentations were simple, but the rolls were made well. I would reccomened Sushi Mon and I would love to go back sometime if I am in the area."

Obviously you will get better fish at a non-ayce place (as a general rule, not always) but these guys are still have really really decent fish! and the chefs are actually JAPANESE (not korean) though there was a Caucasian chef, but he knew his shit. \n\nMy new fave spot after Umiya went downhill a bit."

My favorite used to be Hamada, but they stopped doing it a year or so ago.\n\nThey have some rules, which seem fair.  They state that you must eat everything (including rice) in order to avoid getting charged, but they didn't seem to enforce that rule, grabbing plates away before we had a chance to eat every crumb.  I think as long as you don't abuse the all-you-can-eat, they are totally cool about it.\n\nThe place is nothing special, located in a shopping strip mall.  However, they are open late, which is a real plus in my book.  We went late, and there were quite a few people coming and going.\n\nThe hamachi and maguro nigiri were actually very good.  The miso soup was not (too watery and not much tofu).  The sunomono salad was also very tasty and fresh.  The rolls are big, so order conservatively until you see what I am talking about.  The 9-1-1 roll was scorching HOT!  We loved it, but unless you want to sweat, don't order it.  The menu warns you in case you don't listen to me.  Keep in mind the rule if you don't eat everything.\n\nOverall, I give it a thumbs up.  I would go back if I was looking a late night sushi spot for sure.  The total bill for 3 people was $95.78 and that included 3 all-you-can-eat orders and 1 large Sapporo.  Tip was extra."

The sushi is ALWAYS fresh, the service is ALWAYS fast, the chefs are ALWAYS nice and ready to recommend something.It is a little pricey comparing to other places, but definitely worth your $.\nHowever..this place is SO tiny..and if you got on a Saturday or Friday night..you would have to wait 30minutes at least to get in..but we ALWAYS wait 'cuz we'r good sushi loverz :D"

Even though there is limit on the pricey items such as uni and fish collar, but try to eat everything on the menu. That'd be a challenge. And just for fun, order the monster roll. It is huge. Try stuffing down one of those at the end of your meal. Overall, super delicious."

From the moment I got in there I felt like I was being rushed. First off there is a 45 minute time limit on the dinner all you can eat. Then if you do not know exactly what you want to order when you are asked the chef will not wait for you to decide or help you decide, they will just skip you. Near the end of are dinner are chef up and disappeared for 20 minutes and no one asked if we needed anything. If I am paying for a timed dinner I find this unacceptable. Then at the end of the meal we got a punch card where if you get 10 all you can eats you get one for free. I like this, but again they put a time limit on the punch card!\n\nSo if you are in a rush and want to eat sushi then this is a decent place to go, but if you want to relax and take your time, find a different sushi place."

            "review": "Everyone can argue which AYCE sushi is best in Sin City but in my sushi-venturing tenure, Mon is the best. (Note: OPINION)\n\nThis is the sister franchise of the renowned Goyemon, in which I was disappointed with in terms of service. There is practically no difference other than the infrastructure  because they serve practically the same rolls with maybe some minor differences.\n\nEvery visit I've had here, they have been on top of their service. The servers tend to lack personalities but who needs personality when you have great service? I routinely begin my rolls with the Volcano, which can take a bit longer but Mon takes a reasonable 5 minutes max as to Goyemon which took approximately 20 minutes. Why such a discrepancy? No excuse other than terrible service.\n\nMy favorites: Volcano, sexy girl, ecstasy, philadelphia, hurricane, 911(warning: very spicy hence, the name), cynthia, & stacy.\nAll cooked to near perfection and delight. Fresh avocado, fish, rice, etc.\n\nSome tips:\n- Order by half rolls unless you have a large party. I'm sure you're here to stuff yourselves but you should take advantage of the diversity of the rolls you can get with an AYCE menu. Diversity over quantity.\n- Make your order subsequently to receiving. Start with one roll then once it arrives, order your next so that you don't have to wait long periods of time cause sushi does take some meticulous care to make.\n- Chew slowly! Since sushi has rice, it has a lot of carbs. No need to be rapid since you get all you can eat cause the faster you eat, the more carbs you consume which fills up your stomach.\n- Get a stamp card! Whether or not you're an out of town visitor, you're destined to come back since it's so good and every 10 stamps is one free AYCE meal. They really do accumulate, especially when you come with big parties. \n\nDon't forget to leave some room(I doubt it) for dessert! They serve green tea ice cream, mochi ice cream (strawberry & vanilla, lychee, etc. \n\nOverall, I truly enjoy being a local here. You can never go wrong with an endless selection of sushi."

Purchased 2 chicken teriyaki combination dinners, baked mussels( which i suspect to be the culprit here)and gyoza. Upon waking the next morning, my girlfriend began vomiting. She said her stomach was a wreck and she was physically ill and could not leave the house. I on the other hand was in training for a new job and had to attend work. About an hour into my day, I noticed a queasy ache creeping in my stomach. This queasy ache quickly escalated, and in less then an hour I was running to the bathroom to vomit. Unable to leave work, I had to push on. I was having terrible cold sweats, my body was achy from head to toe, and every so often I had to run back to the bathroom to puke. Upon returning home, my girlfriend, who was still in an awful state (still is), called Sushi Mon to inform them of the issue. To our surprise the restaurant did not offer us any kind of apology or even a refund but informed us to go to the doctor and show them paperwork to prove our story. I went to the doctor today. My girlfriend wants her own immune system to fight it . She's the kind that unless she's dying she doesn't go to Doctors office . If she doesn't feel better by tomorrow she will definitely go to the doctor. But I'm in utter disbelief on how this restaurant handles such public health concerns. This is how outbreaks happen! Don't plan to eat here ever again!"

From $26 to $28...still a bargain for AYCE sushi. You can also opt to do a la carte. But really, who wants to do that? \n\nIt's a small intimate space with a sushi bar. We sat at the sushi bar to get to know the sushi chefs and watch them make the sushi and rolls. Basically, you get to order from the entire menu...AYCE. So many to choose from. My mom who doesn't eat raw fish went for the special rolls and cooked items...she was in heaven. \n\nFor those of us who are fans of sushi and LOVE fresh fish...all I can say is YOWZAH and MORE please! Each AYCE patron gets one order of Toro and Uni. Unfortunately, the night we came, there was no Uni left. But the Toro was delicious. I have never had Toro before so I was surprised that it resembled fresh meat. Is that fish? Wow! So fresh and so good.\n\nMy fave is salmon so I ordered it in bulk. It was so fresh, no smell and no sign of fishiness at all. I am so against not so fresh fish...that the freshness of the fish we were served here competes with more expensive a la carte sushi locations I have been to in the past. My experience here was amazing. \n\nI had lots and lots of special rolls, hand rolls, nigiri sushi, shrimp tempura, mussels, dynamite etc, etc, etc that I was bursting at the seams. I barely could breathe when walking out of there. \n\nWe all had a wonderful time and this was the first time I have ever been to an AYCE sushi where I can say that the fish is fresh and tasty. Great experience for sure and even the chefs and the servers were friendly, quick to serve and the sushi chefs kept asking us constantly what else we wanted.\n\nI will for sure come back here again with my appetite in tow. Until we meet again...."

I tried it a while ago and it didn't leave any impression so I tried it again and still nothing special.  Order 1/2 order so you can try the other rolls.  I like their grilled yellowtail collar and one other roll (incredible hulk roll??)  Their seared albacore, unagi and shrimp tempura were not bad.  Other than that........just average.  Don't get the uni..trust me..$27.99 for dinner (60 min).  Lunch is cheaper but you only get 45 minutes.  Service was great except for the cranky male host.  He was rude and he grabbed the menu from my hand when I was looking at it before I was seated.   \"Am I not supposed to see the menu?\"  He said \"yes you can see the menu\" Maybe he's having a bad day?"

(Now if only J-town has aYCE sushi) A bit of a drive from the Strip, but very very worth it. \n\nOur seat at the bar placed us right in front of our sushi chef, who made our orders fresh right when we ordered it. All the nigiri we ordered tasted great -- especially the seared ahi tuna and the super white tuna. The cut rolls were delicious, especially for an AYCE place. We also tackled the Sushi Monster Roll -- a roll cut into 5 pieces, which is the size of your palm. It takes a while to make so order that first over the nigiri rolls and other rolls so that you aren't waiting a while for it. However, one thing we didn't realize was that everything under the 5-piece roll section are just as big as the Sushi Monster Roll. We ordered the spider roll and that was super huge too! \n\nThe AYCE menu also includes side orders, such as edamame and gyoza, as well as dessert. After all the sushi, I ended my meal with a bowl of creamy green tea ice cream (they also have tempura ice cream, but that would've been too much after all the food I ate). Great food, great price, great place! Sushi-mon is on my list of places to go every time I'm in Vegas."

I didn't know it was that far until I called another coworker for directions, and realized it was \"Holy Cow! I am practically starting to drive back to California\" far.  Last time I came here to eat, I just blindly followed Maryland Parkway all the way down until I reached the destination.\n\nWe arrived at 11:45am, when they opened and they already have 1/3 of the restaurant filled on a Wednesday.  Coworkers have raved about this place for a good 9 months we been working together and the food they served I have enjoyed.  And this time it was pretty good, except for the first order of sushi roll we were served (the rice tasted like it was old from last night).  But after that the rice seemed fresh like the fresh super white tuna they served us.\n\nTip:  Always check the specials of the day or ask the sushi chefs.\n\nToday's Special:\nSuper White Tuna - so good we ordered a second round, and highly recommended. \nCajun Salmon - it was alright\nJapanese Snapper- alright\nFresh Scallop - pretty good (I don't care for the yum yum scallops the Japanese sushi places serve here in general)\nYellowtail Belly - don't have it :(\nWe also ordered the limit 1 per customer items:\nUni - good\nAmaebi - good (but no deep fried heads)\nHamachi Kama(Yellowtail collar) - good. Makes an excellent meal with just rice.\n\nTried the poki roll (didn't look like what we ordered last time) and the rice was not fresh. It tasted like it was from the previous night.\n\nSpider Roll - huge and tasted great, but served with rice paper.  Rice paper usually costs $1 more, but I still like it made with the traditional nori.\nPixie Roll - Another huge roll, and tasted good.\nVolcano Roll - Pretty good, but can be messy to eat.  But sometimes messy is a good thing when it comes to food :)\n\nAlso order:\nMasago with Quail Eggs - it was beautiful and I enjoyed it\nTamago - The eggs are most likely ordered premade, and they just to cut it and assemble it with the rice and nori strip, but I liked it nonetheless.\nFresh Water Eel - not bad\n\nDesserts - we each picked different ones. I had the green tea ice cream, coworkers ordered the Lychee Sorbet (looks good), and Tempura Ice Cream (good).\n\nBUT after we asked for and signed for our credit cards and the waitress came and picked stuff off of our table, I suddenly see a confused cockroach stumbling from where the soy sauce bottles and AYCE menu is.  I was in shocked and not sure where it came from, except maybe when the waitress came she might have set something down on the table, and grabbed our dessert bowls and left the unwanted hitchhiker.  Or it drop from the sky via the ventilation vent, which does NOT have a filter in place.  \n\nWe waved the waitress over and she was shocked and afraid of the roach as well, but hesitantly picked up a used napkin in from the table and dropped it on top of the cockroach and picked it up off the table.  It was not the happy ending to our otherwise enjoyable meal, so -1 for that.\n\nSo 3 stars.  Good place to get sushi for those living in the South South East of Las Vegas. And they have Caked next door, which have good cupcakes, and they are on TV! (But I digressed)"

Also you'll get to order uni and sweet shrimp! \n\nAlthough it is a little out of the way from the Las Vegas Strip, i wouldnt mind visiting Sushi Mon again. Maybe I'll come here on the way to vegas before i check in ... or on the way back home.\n\nNonetheless, Sushi Mon, YOU will see me again! Next time.. it'll be for dinner!"

Theirs has always been fresh, as is the fish. They've never made a mistake with my carryout orders and the place is always hopping in the evenings so it's too crowded inside to wait for your order or a table.  People wait at the tables and chairs outside the building.  If you're from Vegas the heat doesn't feel so bad, but tourists will probably think it's too hot to wait outside."

            "review": "I absolutely love this place! It would be my first go-to choice for sushi. They have a fairly big menu and the prices are pretty decent. I love variety so I always choose to have ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi.  You have to finish your order before you order the next roll.  That makes sense because it'd be such a waste of food, and of course no sharing.  Don't be cheap and ghetto and try to dish it off to your friends.  The prices are already fair as is.\n\nService is fast and friendly.  I love their 911 roll! I have a pretty high tolerance for spices and this roll is so painfully delicious.  When it comes to a spicy tuna roll, I prefer the tuna well diced and mixed with chili sauce which is how Sushi Mon makes theirs.  I don't like the low end sushi style of a tuna roll with just a blob of spicy mayo on top.  Their LASAGNA ROLL is also a favorite.  Try it out.\n\nThe last time I was there, I had apple/pear sake.  It was so good.  That says a lot from someone who rarely likes sake because of it's strong taste and burning sensation.  You definitely should give it a shot.\n\nOff topic - it's a small restaurant. You get the mom and pop shop vibe (which I love and appreciate) Seating is pretty limited.  They're usually busy so they don't take reservations. That's the only \"bad\" thing I'll say about the place. Just make sure you plan to wait a little bit if you decide to dine their during the naturally busy hours.\n\nOverall, I miss and love this place!"

The one thing I love about Sushi Mon is they include appetizers in the all-you-can-eat menu. The sushi is delicious. I mean, it is an all-you-can-eat place, but the seafood is pretty darn good quality. I usually get this knotty feeling in my stomach when I eat mediocre fish, and the only reason why my tummy aches from this place is cause by over eating. I will admit, I usually have to loosen my belt a few notches at the conclusion of my meal. I've listed my favorites below. The garlic tuna and cajun albacore are must tries!

I was a bit disappointed. \n\nOverall Rating: 3.5 Stars \n\n$26.95 for AYCE at dinner (60 minutes to eat) is not bad considering the tremendous selection they had available. They have the good stuff like toro, uni, amaebi, ikura (limit of 1 per person for the toro, uni and amaebi). There was an extensive list of nigiri, hand rolls and cut rolls and the list of cooked stuff was not too shabby at all. They even have dessert on the menu! The best part of my meal was the 2 natto hand rolls. I love natto and they rarely have natto anything at restaurants. A major plus is that they do not overload your items with rice. I know a lot of AYCE places stuff you with rice and then make you wait forever for your next item, but not this place. \n\nThe downside? The good stuff wasn't actually that good! It was just average and not very consistent. My sister told me that her first order of salmon nigiri was good and the second order was dry. Huh? My uni was not fresh, the ikura was flavorless, the amaebi was a bit slimy and the toro was not bad but it wasn't exactly melt in your mouth. Also, other random pieces of nigiri that I had were just average. I am so torn! I really wanted to like this place but it's only just ok. Even though my natto hand rolls were da bomb, I know it comes out of a box so how hard is it to screw that up? \n\nI wouldn't mind coming here again because I love the selection. I just hope that I came on an off day and that the next time I come, I will be luckier."

My daughter had been here last month with her college friends & warned me of their negative experience. We were neither greeted nor served at our table for 10 minutes. I had to ask for water & menus. They came late with a longer wait for the orders to be taken. The soup & salad came, but we had to endure more than 20 minutes for the main order. My daughter's order came & was finished but mine didn't. The waitress walked pass & never bothered to check on us. I went to the counter & asked the male staff if I should be served or I should leave. He was not apologetic at all. He went to the kitchen & I was served a plate of cold food that was obviously left too long forgotten in the kitchen."

I mean, I'm no sushi expert but I thought it was GREAT!  \n\nOrdered (12 people)\n1. Super white tuna -my FAVORITE thing there, nice and clean flavored with the ponzu sauce that it had.  Oh so MELT in your mouth delicious.  Get it!\n2. Salmon -it's always my go-to when I eat sushi.  Very soft and melt in your mouth awesome.\n3. Masago w/quail egg -crunch of the masago mixed with the creaminess of the quail egg...MMMMM!\n4. Uni w/quail egg (only served at dinner) -ORGASM IN YO MOUTH\n5. Ikura w/quail egg -ocean flavor with that creaminess?  Yes.\n6. Shrimp tempura -Filler.  It was ok but, not doing again.  \n7. Seared tuna -Also came with the same ponzu sauce.  It was ok, probably woody order it again.\n8. Soft shell crab roll -I'm a sucker for soft shell crab.  Another must order.\n9. Green tea ice cream -My palette cleanser.  Nice green tea flavor.  A must after I eat sushi.\n10. Tempura ice cream -JUST.  GET.  IT.  A deep fried japanese bread holding vanilla ice, whip cream, and a cherry.  Yum!  If they drizzled chocolate syrup over it...PERFS.\n\nThere were other things ordered but these were what I mostly ate.  Service was not that bad.  Orders came out once they were ready (not like other places that come out at ONE time).  That's a plus for me.  Well...the fact that it was ALL YOU CAN EAT...made it a SUPER plus for me.

Foods showed up really slow and rice tasted kinda bad enough(hard and not stick together). Anyway, just save your hard earned money(gasoline $$ & $21.95 lunch or $26.95 dinner after 4pm), because there are tons of Japanese restaurant for just sushi rolls or sashimi in LA.

I have been frequenting this place over the years and have had the same good service every time. The sushi chefs and some of the employees that I have seen and talked to here at this location are from Japan, good to have some authenticity. All of the friends that I have brought here have loved the food and usually have bought the All You Can Eat special and happy with the value. Check the Special Rolls Out! http://www.sushi-mon.com/menu/special/index.php\n\nI recommend the All You Can Eat special; lunch time costs less than dinner, you have to eat everything you order, and you have like 45 min to an hour to eat so come hungry! If your not sharing with others consider getting half rolls so you get to try more and not fill up so quick. The special includes some non-sushi items that I like including Baked Mussels, Tempura Shrimp, Fried Calamari, and Cucumber Salad. Sushi Rolls are awesome here, flavor, the rice, the ingredients, can't go wrong. You want quality similar to local Nobu and Hamada at under $30.00 per person without feeling pretentious and don't mind simple decor then this is the place you should go in Vegas to eat sushi. Don't forget dessert, I recommend the Green Tea or Red Bean Ice Cream.\n\nSushi Mon use to be open until 4am way back in the day when it first started business, now it is still open pretty late, but not 24 hours. The line can get pretty long if you go during busy hours but definitely worth the wait.\n\nHere are some pics from my last visit:\n\nhttp://flic.kr/p/9sf84P\n\nhttp://flic.kr/p/9si9QE\n\nhttp://flic.kr/p/9sf9Kn\n\nDon't forget to grab a punch card when you pay!

Everything's made/cut fresh. The quality of the fish is on point. For lunch all for $21.95. It also includes their choice of appetizers (which includes such like edamame, Takoyaki, shrimp tempura, veggie tempura, poke, cucumber salad, seaweed salad, miso soup, etc.) and DESSERT (Mochi ice cream, tempura ice cream, and other more ice cream haha)! It's not close to the strip but worth the drive, trust me. It's a long list of choices for their rolls and sushi, actually quite a bit of reading. And allllll so yummyyyy! I wish there was one near home :( \n\nIt's better if you sit at the bar for the all you can eat. Cause you can order for sushi right there instead of bugging the waitresses that are serving others. But do be aware you do need to eat all the rice that comes with the fish too or I think they charge you extra."

Not to mention all their special rolls as well for the AYCE menu. If you can eat a lot of sushi like I can, you can easily get your money's worth!\n\nLocation: Corner of a shopping complex with a lot of parking. Place is kinda small, but if you don't go during peak, you'll be fine. They have bar seating as well. Best part, they're open LATE! Vegas standards, 1AM isn't late, but for sushi/restaurant standards, it meets it amazingly.\n\nService: No issues with service. They were attentive, kind, and very quick to refill water and clean the table off.\n\nThis most recent trip, I just wasn't hungry enough to get my money's worth and ordered the S.S. combo. First time actually that I dined here without ordering the AYCE! Combo came with their salad, soup, and the main dish which included spicy tuna roll, 3 piece nigiri, and 7 piece sashimi for $16!\n\nOverall: I'd say this is a great sushi spot outside of LA, where I live. For some reason, I always come to Vegas and crave sushi. If you're wanting AYCE, I would suggest this spot for sure. Def bang for your buck without the loss of quality."

During non-busy hours, you can actually eat longer than the regulated 60 mins but usually people are full before they hit an hour landmark.  \n\nFishes were fresh.  Make sure to check their daily specials!  I like their fresh scallop (its previously frozen, however) but still pretty good for AYCE standard.  Uni melts in your mouth as well.  Sweet shrimp is better than typical AYCE place too.  I also liked their salmon, yellowtail, amber jack, albacore sushi.  Their tempura shrimp and seaweed salad is good too.  One of the best I have had in the AYCE restaurant.  Thumbs up.   They also make pretty good rolls, including 1/2 order rolls so for those who can't consume the whole spider roll, this is the place to go.\n\nMy only gripe for this place is that their sushi rice is bit on the firm side.  It wasn't  very \"sticky\" when I was there.  Maybe just one of the bad nights?  Their Ikura (Salmon Eggs) weren't that salty too so if you don't like fishy stuff, try to avoid that.  Other than that, its definitely worth to make a trip here if you are very hungry and loves sushi!"

Then, there is Sushi Mon, the 1 in 20 where it is not! \nFirst of all, the well staffed chefs and servers are exceptionally considerate to the patrons. When I say \"exceptionally considerate\", I don't mean in the over-the-top annoying manner either. There is a genuine warmness in the staff, even in the \"welcome-to-this-sushi-bar-we-have-to-greet-everyone-who-walks-in-the-door-so-here-I-am-giving-you-this-greating-for-the-seventy-third-time-today\" welcome. What pleased me even more is the fact that everyone seemed to be pleased with their coworkers and appeared to enjoy EVERY aspect and tasks of their jobs (I might even seek part-time employment here, well maybe not... but I'll keep that idea in my memory bank).\nSushi Chef, Hiro, was awesome! He made my wife and I's 8th wedding anniversary exceptional.  The whole experience was first class. It was if we were at dinner with old friends we hadn't seen in a while and had a chance to catch-up with each other's families.  \nOh yeah, I almost forgot...we ate food here as well. love the fact that you can order 1/2 rolls which made the sampling of their variety enjoyable. Hiro was very good at explaining each dish and offered great suggestions. Besides the normal rolls we ordered he had us try the Green Mussels. I was hesitant with the Mussels but was so glad I did. And the offering of the Fatty Tuna was well called. Hiro was correct in his description of melt in your mouth buttery taste on that one. The two daily special rolls, Hurricane and Ecstasy were scrumptious. I think my favorite however was the Domingo. \nThe menu items we ordered were perfectly cooked.  Their gyoza comes steamed or fried.  I'm a fried guy but ordered steamed on a whim. Order the Gyoza and order it steamed. The flavor is very kind to your momma!\nI can say more but, I want to leave some of the experience up to you."

(just leave a little more tip would ya?)  \n\nBut if you are a nigiri person, heres the scoop.. Seems like you are only allowed so many servings of the good stuff per person (maybe 3 or 4) then you get the second rate stuff.. heres what i mean.. say you have 2 people.. you order 6 orders of  hamachi.. they come out nice, fresh, white belly part.. yum so good.. you want more?..\" 6 more please,,\" what you will get will not be even close to what you got the first time!  you might get the redder part of the fish or older and kinda dried out.  nothing like the first batch..  So heres what you gotta do.. order 8 or 10 orders the first time.. then move on to the next fish and never return to one that you've already ordered.. the best thing is to take people who order rolls, that way you get to have their portion of the \"fresh stuff\" while they dine on the rolls!!  bonus!!  (this rule dosent apply to rolls only nigiri, the rolls are always consistent i think)\n\nThere are specials too, they are unlimited (not part of the holy trinity of \"1 each\", uni, toro and ama ebi) there is also a supposed 1 hour time limit but its not strictly enforced (i just leave a bigger tip when i stay longer)\n\nThe next question, how does it stack up to Hikari?  The fresh stuff is much better than Hikari, the 2nd round stuff is not.  You can't order just sashimi (no rice) here only nigiri.\n\nPros: Freshest AYCE made to order sushi \"first round only\"\n\nCons: Uni, Ama ebi, and toro, 1 order only, 2nd round of nigiri is lacking (but understandable why they have to do it to get rid of product and not be cleaned out) \n\nThe fine print: you have to eat every thing that you order, or you have to pay for what you don't eat on top of your AYCE price.. \n\nTips: Get there before opening to avoid long wait times.  check specials board on the back wall.. if they have Moi (pacific thread fin) get it!!  that is the bomb!!  if you order Ama Ebi, ask them to fry the heads for you.. its like eating a potato chip but shrimp flavored.. to get the most for you money.. avoid fillers and fried stuff in the beginning they fill you up faster save them for the final rounds.  avoid the tako poke, its not sliced tako its idakko (whole small tako), more rubbery and chewy, nothing like Hawaiian style tako poke. \n\nVerdict: it teeters at 3 1/2 stars but if you follow the 10 step nigiri program i've laid out it could be a 4 star deal."

I wanted to try some excellent sushi.\n\nHere at Sushimon, note:\n\n1. The wait - You are gonna wait for a table.  We came at 1:45 and got to sit down at 2:35.  A bit of a wait, however, they use a really good waitlist system online to notify you when your table is ready.  Although we waited a bit over 45 minutes, it is what we were quoted and we were able to hang out at the Starbucks for a while, so that made the wait worth it.\n\n2.  The food - Besides, the normal speciality rolls, I ordered the Black Tobiko, The Salmon Belly, and the Sanma (Pike Makerel) from their special of the day menu.  I decided that I wanted Amai-ebi, Uni and also hamachi kama so they told me I had to pay the dinner menu price which is 26.95.  I was good with that.\n\n3. Very good food, no problems as it is fresh and tasty.\n\n4. The service - This was a huge issue for sure.  I went with the dinner menu at lunch to have the Amai-Ebi, Uni and Hamachi-Kama.  I did not get the shrimp fried heads from the Amai-Ebi and I never got the Hamachi-Kama.  Since I did get part of the shrimpt and the Uni, they advised me that they would charge me the dinner price.  I get that, and no problem at all. i was full, they would have made the items for me had I demanded, however waiting 40 minutes for these items I got full and decided to pass.  I thought it was decent for them to offer to cook it even though we were there past the 45 minute limit for all you can eat. I did not care for the fact that they said that if I wanted the heads with the Amai-Ebi it is a separate order. I was kind of shocked at that as I don't believe that is normal. However, that is my mistake. If you want the heads, be sure to order it.\n\n5.  The service again - What is not the greatest at this place is the pace of their service.  Wavering between 100% full and 75% full, the service is extremely slow.  The waiters you have to flag down, they don't check in with you often.  The serving of rice is quite a bit on the nigiri sushi and I think the only way you can get your money's worth is to order enough the first time.  If you want an accurate order, you will need to have them repeat it back and then confirm all the bits and pieces that you want to make sure that this is what you are expecting.\n\nGood food, fresh food, mediocre to good service and oddities in their menu and what they include is what this place is all about. Overall, I probably will try out some other places or go back to my regular places. I was not as impressed as I thought for a quality place with a waiting list to get it.  I will for sure adjust my ordering the next time I go there and be very diligent to make sure I get what I ordered and paid for.\n\nGood place to go, just be careful."

This also allowed us to pool our various orders and get the most variety while we also got the most bang for our buck. Sitting at the bar is advisable if you want to get straight to business. Obviously, lunch will deliver a better value.\n\nThe miso was a boon to us dehydrated souls. The Nigiri is all very solid. Their garlic tuna is a delicious standout, and you can't go wrong with the yellow tail. The mackerel offers that ever so distinctive fresh water taste-- may not be for everyone.\n\nYou could just as easily fill up exclusively on their specialty rolls and definitely not go wrong there. The Hurricane impressed me most of all-- so many flavors dancing on the tongue that I couldn't even describe them to you. Ecstasy roll = solid. The Flying Jason, while delicious, should be ordered with caution. It's one of the cooked rolls and contains melted cheese with a distinct, mustard like aftertaste. Great stuff but it is very filling and should probably be ordered right before dessert if at all (if you care about maximizing your value). The same goes for the Baked 428-- yummy but oh so filling. \n\nThe tempura ice cream-- I don't know how many sushi places do this but this place definitely does it RIGHT. Perhaps the most guilt ridden dessert per gram-- it is a serving of mochi covered in a doughnut like tempura crust that creates an absolutely heavenly experience (and one that can be enjoyed with chop sticks, nonetheless!) You must order this, at least once in your life.\n\nIf you are in the mood for gorging on quality sushi and don't want to shell out the cash for a place on the strip, I can promise you that Sushi Mon will lull you into a peaceful food coma."

Personally, I think Sushi Mon is the best - however, it is one of the most expensive.  The only knock on them is:\na.  $27 price tag per head - ouch -- pretty pricey.  Most sushi buffets run around 20-24 bucks.  If you look around, you can get some under 20 too...  If they lower their weekly prices, they probably get more customers. \nb.  1 hour time limit on dinner -- early in the meal, rather than enjoying the meal, I found myself \"clock\" watching.  But, actually, this was not bad, after 45 minutes, I was ready to be rolled out in a wheel barrow.  I was stuffed and felt like I was going to give birth. Being a guy, this probably would be my 15 minutes of fame on CNN.\nc.  You may have to wait 20-40 minutes.  By the way, problem with waiting is that there is NO waiting area.  The street is it.  \n\nWe have been here 3 times already.  Unfortunately, they do not take reservations.. Be ready to wait in line.  The first time we were here, we had to wait 45 minutes (ended up shopping at Smith's grocery store to past the time).  Secondly, I would recommend asking to be seated at the BAR.  When they seat you at the table, they give you this menu and you have to hail down a waiter.  I rather sit at the bar and watched the \"sushi guys\" make the sushi.  Also, you get quicker service instead of waving down a waiter.  You can ask the sushi guy directly to make you the roll.  As for the sushi, it was fresh!  We love the cooked eel, salmon, and yellowtail.  yum... definitely, we will be back!"

I think our server was Anthony? Well he kept messing up our orders and I asked for the mussles like 3-4 times before I got them. And I ordered one green salad and a poki tuna but I ended up getting two green salads and no poki tuna I had to remind them twice. Like cmon guys it wasn't even busy. Definitely not coming back here when I have somewhere to be because that just totally took all my time and I'm always on a time crunch"

That NEVER happens!! =D\n\nBut besides that, I'm glad there's a sushi place located on this side of town that is opened pretty late. It's good for those late night sushi fix and you don't have to go all the way to the busy Chinatown area.\n\nAside for the Cynthia roll, we order a couple others and they were all delicious. Each order came with 8 pieces. \n\nCannot justify giving Sushi Mon the full 5 stars because 1. it's a bit pricey if you are planning to order a la carte. I'm a  very small eater...I love trying different sushi rolls but I just CANNOT, will not get AYCE because it won't be worth the price for me. So ordering a la carte, you're looking at $10-14 per order. Also, the place is pretty small which means tables are fairly close to each other. Not a big fan of that...I really don't want the table next to me to hear my mildly-inappropriate conversations to my significant other. ;)"

My friend was the first to notice it, ordering beef tataki (nigiri) for all. When I turned to face the board, toro caught my eye immediately, so I got the max order of 1 per person for both medium toro and garlic seared toro (both nigiri also). Another friend got garlic edamame (actually not quite as good as Yama's, sorry), and I discovered the yellowtail collar, which I remember someone recently raving about (and hilariously referring to it as \"chin\").\n\nI've gotta admit that the medium toro was obviously not every connoisseur's favorite fatty otoro cut, but it was still pretty nice. The garlic seared version, however, was absolutely delicious. So were the beef tataki, a tender morsel that is probably what pho meat should be, and the yellowtail collar, which was, in a word, succulent. It was not dry like you'd sometimes find in cooked fish. It was flavorful. And my fingers still smell of fish, which is a good thing for me. Although I can't remember having yellowtail collar specifically before, this is now my baseline reference for the future.\n\nCouple other things that I tried were the cajun albacore (pretty good, probably not the best), the sushimon-style lasagna roll, the twist being that crisp cucumber in the middle, the sexy girl roll, which I probably could not have endured more than one spicy piece of, and the tempura ice cream, which is exactly the contrast of temperatures, textures, and flavors that you'd expect.\n\nAfter dinner tonight, I've decided that this is head and shoulders above most of the other local AYCE sushi joints. The one exception might be Sushi House Goyemon, its sister restaurant that probably also has specials and actually has better desserts (note to self: suck it up and make the drive to Goyemon again one of these days). Sushi lovers, make this a must-stop destination and be prepared to be amazed."

The fish here is fresh, the chefs have great suggestions as to new things to try and it is AYCE!!!  I even drive down from North Las Vegas for this sushi.\n\nI am a big Uni (sea urchin) fan and have been consistently impressed with the quality.  My father (who used to go to Japan for business often) said that it was some of the best uni that he has had in the US.  The problem is they do limit you.  The other fish on the menu has consistantly been fresh and delicious.  Don't be afraid to try new things along with the gold standards (yellowtail, tuna, salmon) as they are all good.\n\nLike most of the AYCE sushi places I have been to you can order anything on the menu including appetizers and dessert.  The menu is a good size with a nice variety of fish and rolls.  Another positive is that if you are the only diner for AYCE you can order half rolls.  This sushi place didn't try to fill me up on rice or give me a paper thin slice of fish.  I would rate this sushi place high for the AYCE AND the sitdown sushi places.\n\nI guess that they have another location but I haven't been there.\n\nSeating can be rough but I haven't had to wait long... for even less time sit at the sushi bar."

So I'm an amateur!\n\nBut I do like me some Sushi Mon. \n\nThe AYCE deal is available both for lunch ($22) and dinner ($27) and if you are planning on trying more than three rolls, this is your best bet since the prices otherwise take you over $25 real quickly. Unlike some other places, the AYCE sushi does not include miso soup, seaweed salad or a drink, just so you know. \n\nLet's say you love sushi but your friends don't- bring them here anyway, since there are plenty of other Asian-themed dishes they can try while you grab the fish n' rice. There is a $10 \"dinner special\" with a green salad, soup, vegetable tempura, chicken teriyaki, potato salad and yes, a California roll, but your non-sushi friends can give that to you. Also, there are breaded and fried pork options, other teriyaki plates, etc. \n\nBut back to the sushi, which to me has to mean AYCE. Prepared mostly by Japanese (not always so at other places) and served very quickly once made, it has always been fresh and exactly as described on the menu, which is a big help since I'm not an expert, of course. Something new to me were the fried rolls (volcano sushi, flying Jason roll, etc.) and I could have done without them because they added lots of ballast, but it shows the creativity of the sushi masters at work. You can ask for half-rolls of most offerings, which allows you to try more types and not feel completely stuffed as you leave.\n\nNow the place is indeed small and very popular, so you should definitely expect to spend up to 30-40 minutes waiting for a table if there are more than 2 in your party and if it's after 5 PM most days, but it is worth it. And beware- the wait staff is definitely militant about not sharing AYCE with those who order entrees and are also always on rice-wastin' patrol. Don't be the one to be called out- I've seen this happen once and it's not even funny.\n\nWhat's interesting is that reviews of other sushi restaurants in the area (or even across town) often compare whatever place is being reviewed to Sushi Mon, which means it must have a standard-setting reputation among those who really know their sushi. As I said, I'm an amateur, but even so- Sushi Mon is a great place for all levels of sushi-knowledge, it seems."

Being from Reno, the capital of AYCE sushi, we were too spoiled to spend for a la carte anywhere else in Vegas, and this place was recommended by a few people.  Checking yelp and looking over the menu we got excited, the variety was great.  \nI like to start with nigiri but the fish looked bad, my yellowtail had a lot of different shades to it, maybe it's the way they cut it or maybe it's just kind of old but they do give good fish to rice ratiio.  Also, the salmon didn't come with lemon on it as it does at my favorite place back home, and the sushi chef was fairly inattentive when I wanted to ask for some slices so I just dealt with it.\nThe long rolls were not anything to write home about either.  They were loosely rolled and had a lot of rice, so much that when I picked one up it fell into soy sauce which splattered ALL over me.  When this happened, the sushi chef offered soda water, which was nice, but it didn't have to happen at all.  \nWe ordered a couple rolls with no issue but when my boyfriend ordered the Monster roll, thinking it would be piled high with fish, we got disappointed.  The chef made something that looked delicious then piled a whole bowl worth of rice onto it, rolled it up and served it.  My boyfriend decided the only way he could fit it in his mouth would be to take out the actual roll and discard the rice.  He told the waiter he wasn't going to eat it and the waiter was very nice, saying he would have warned him if he'd asked, stating it might be better for a table of 5 people (it's only 5 slices).  We just wish the chef had warned us. But we weren't charged for not eating the rice which was good, cause they charge over $12 for that roll, and that's almost half the cost of dinner.  \nSo, to summarize, love the AYCE, love the late hours and variety of rolls.  There was so much we wanted to try that we didn't get a chance to.    Service is also excellent but the chef could've been better/more service oriented."

There was very little rice and the uni and shrimp were extremely fresh. The hamachi kama was cooked perfectly, had that nice char from the grill that gives it that smoky flavor and it was seasoned well. \n\nThe rest of the sushi were good as well.

Ok there was one kid and he was really nice. Really it's like fishing. You just sit and wait and maybe you'll get to eat. And pay the 25/person bill. \n\nSushi isn't bad.

I make it a goal to eat here set least once every time I visit. \n\nThe rolls are tasty and I love that you can get 1/2 orders so you can try many different dishes and not have to waste food.  I used to always order rolls until I discovered that their nigiri is surprisingly fresh. My usual order consists of uni, sweet shrimp, shrimp head (tastes like shrimp chips and its not on the menu), yellow tail collar, 6 x super white tuna (I'm salivating just thinking about this buttery goodness), 5 x albacore (the Cajon albacore is also delicious), 4 x scallops ( giant Japanese scallops, not the dinky ones mixed in mayo), tempura ice cream, and lychee sherbert (the mochi is good too if you' re a mochi fan).\n\nI eat like I'm preparing to hibernate for the winter. It's cheap and soooooooooooooo good. Mmm."

Granted its sushi but some places tend to bring the flavor. There fried rolls weren't to our liking at all, the color seemed as if the oil may have been old and being we both felt very sick at the end of our evening and into the following days im for certain it was.

He looks kinda like Kim Hyun Joong but Kim Hyun Joong has plastic surgeon and 99-100% of Korean actors have plastic surgeon. He doesn't have plastic surgeon so I kept on thinking he must be Vietnamese. I finally asked if he is and he said yes but he doesn't know how to speak Vietnamese. Mystery solved. He doesn't seem as difficult or strict as the Korean and Japanese. Might be easy going to ask him then the others. Usually I don't dare to ask to much except to eat my food and pay. He's young so will have less experience but I'm Vietnamese I can handle inexperience than strict personality. He looks like he's from Da Lat region. Em trai nhin thay yeu \u0111uoi, n\u00ean uong sua pha voi \nbot calcium cho to con l\u00ean! \n\nAs for the food, I live a block away so I have to come here for sushi. Everything is either prudent or bland here. Salad has a prudent ginger soy sauce with sesame oil. Sushi hand cut and all sushi roll have bland taste. Fish taste ok, but from time to time the tuna is brown. I stay away from it multiple times. Dipping sauce is only soy sauce + wasabi and no other sauce available. High fresh quality might be given to Kabotu. I have the suspicious that SushiMon is part of Kabotu, Goyemon, and Monta Ramen. Monta Ramen is the noodle house and Goyemon is the sister sushi house that will capture those that doesn't like or know SushiMon. SushiMon on the westside is for those that are in the west but are a fan of SushiMon. Kabotu is for those that willing to pay for the higher quality fish reserve for its priority. Goyemon might be the sister but both SushiMon locations will always have a better quality of fish. Goyemon might is the 3rd standard, so 1st Kabotu, 2nd SushiMon, and 3rd Goyemon. \n\nBest dishes for the buck are the Salmon Dinner Special and Sashimi Lunch Special (include rice + miso soup + salad). 3 hand cuts or 2 hand rolls lunch special (include miso soup + salad) for $9 is not bad. Good price. Sushi at Wasabi on Eastern might be a little better but SushiMon's price is the best in this area. Nake Sushi in Summerlin on Rampart x Lake Mead has a similar deal, but it's in the west side. Here in the southeast, SushiMon is the place.\n\nThis is an AYCE, so be smart when you order or else wait. Order 4-6 at first then go down. DO NOT order 2 at a time, because that's a long wait. Those that complained about the wait, is because they do not go to AYCE often or have lack of experience with AYCE. It's like the Rio buffet, when it's self serve it's fast that's because you serve yourself, but once you order something special like a sauce the waiter seems to disappear for a very long time."

My dad found this before we left for the vacation and decided we wanted to try it. \nOriginally, he was going to do a la carte instead of AYCE. He definitely does not regret his choice. \n\nSitting at the bar is a better experience in my opinion because you don't need to order thru any of the servers. The chefs were all Japanese except one and even though Yoshi, the chef who helped us, didn't look Japanese, he's from the same city my dad is from. Yoshi made our experience better because he made sure to check up on us every once in a while, while still attending to other people at the bar. \n\nAs for the other servers, some were good and some weren't. The younger ones were friendlier and had better attitudes and I learned to ask from them. \n\nFood wise, everything comes out quick, even when you order items like takoyaki or baked mussels that are prepared in the back. This may be because we sat in front of the chef who would hand it to us but even the fried items came out quick. \n\nThe rolls are mediocre. What I like though, is that you can order a half order instead of the whole thing to avoid getting full and allowing you to try more food. Where I go in LA, they don't have that option so it;s best to go with a big group or you'll get full off 2 orders of rolls. \n\nMy absolute favorite thing about this place,though, is that dessert is included as AYCE. I don't know if it;s a Nevada thing but dessert is always a la carte at other AYCE sushi places. And the dessert is good. They have tempura ice cream, mochi, creme brulee, and sorbets. The lychee sorbet was definitely my favorite but we also tried the yuzu sorbet and the green tea creme brulee. \n\nOverall, it was a really good experience and I wish LA had this place. Thank you Yoshi, and the three servers who were kind."

I am more into the traditional japanese sushi, none of that western sushi (dragon roll, california, & philly roll kinda stuff). That said, I cannot comment or review about their western sushi rolls. Fish to rice ratio is well done. If you're feeling adventurous, order deep fried shrimp heads (not on the menu)."

The fish we had was fresh, though the cuts weren't as nice as what we get at Bluefin.  \n\nI also liked that they had various daily specials, so that you could get a small sampling of other higher-ticket  items. We were lucky and the specials were for super white tuna, fresh scallops and white clam. \n\nWe tried the tuna and scallops and they were both tasty. I loved the scallops, they were big fresh pieces and very supple. \n\nThe amaebi was a bigger portion and pretty nice. Sweet, juicy with that distinct raw-shrimp mouth-feel. Yum!  \n\nThe home smoked salmon was interesting! It had bits of dill flecked on it and was smooth, subtly cooked and with a mild creamy flavor. Not as strong a flavor as in commercial smoked salmon, which could be a positive or negative depending on your preference. I liked it but wouldn't buy a large package of it. \n\nI had masago with quail egg. The masago was was briny and sweet with nice pop and a generous portion. The egg seemed a little less fresh. The overall effect was still pleasant.  \n\nThe uni was NOT as fresh as what I've had at other restaurants. There were odd discoloration marks on it, which I haven't seen anywhere else.\n\nWe got a half order of the volcano roll on a friend's recommendation and neither of us liked it. It had a lot of krab in it, which is a turn off.\n\nAn order of gyoza meant 2 little bitty pieces. The boy had those and found them unremarkable. He also had the yakitori, which came in a super heavy sauce. Not something he'd go out of his way to have again, and though the portion was small he tried to enlist my assistance in demolishing it.  \n\nI also had the miso soup with fried amaebi heads. The batter got soggy because the heads were totally submerged in the scalding-hot broth, which was disappointing. Also, the fact that the broth was a few degrees shy of boiling- miso is NOT meant to be boiled because it ruins the integrity and health benefits of the miso. The soup utilized white miso and was still flavorful once it cooled down enough to be edible without the risk of 3rd degree burns. \n\nThe ahi poke salad was very mild in flavor impact. I liked the combination of seaweeds/seaplants in it but otherwise it was forgettable. \n\nThe lychee sorbet was a refreshing option. I liked the little bits of what seemed like candied/dry lychee that I'd occasionally discover.\n\nOverall, it was fun and we enjoyed our beer but we won't venture out of our way when we've had better luck with sushi spots closer to home."

Although all were amazing, the hit to your wallet is worse than some of the gambling tables in Vegas.  \n\n$26.95 gets you all you can eat sushi which includes a plethora of choices. Keep and eye on their chalk board for special cuts. For instance I was fortunate enough to have had Blue Fin tuna which normally is an fin and a leg - yes that was cheesy, sue me - but it was included in the deal. 1 order per person on the special items.\n\nThe house rules are simple and if you can't read, they provide simple illustrations to follow. Despite the handy instruction card they have at the bar, you will inevitably have someone try to cheat the system.  I don't know about you but the last person I try to antagonize is man who is very skilled with a super sharp knife. \n\nIf eating as much sushi as humanly possible is your objective, then void the rolls or ordering too many sides dishes.  Stick with the nigiri and venture out of your comfort zone. Don't be afraid to ask for suggestions and letting them know of any allergies you may have. I have a shell fish allergy so they prepared my sushi on a different cutting board to avoid cross contamination.\n\nThat is really going the extra mile because other sushi establishments I frequent can care less.  The attention to detail and their customer service sets them apart. \n\nIf you want great sushi at a reasonable price, Sushi Mon will definitely hit the spot. Oh and don't forget to try the lychee sorbet... Simply the best!!!"

Sushimon is a must go for me everytime I am in Vegas, EVERYTIME.  \n\nEach time that I eat here, I can't believe that i'm actually eating fresh raw fish that doesn't make me hit the can later.  The sushi rice here is perfect...comes out a little warm with the right amount of vinegar taste that sushi rice should have.  I like that the fish to rice ratio is proportioned right.  Some AYCE's have too much rice, in hopes to fill you up.  Not here.  I love that the AYCE menu is double sided with nigiri, appetizers, dessert and for all you sushi lovers who think you like \"sushi\" (cooked, battered, fried, saucey rolls) they have a whole side dedicated to you.  They also have specials of the day. Toro, fresh scallop, super white tuna, even mirugai have appeared before so remember to ask your server before you miss out.  The servers are hot and cold...sometimes they are super nice and sometimes they seem like they really hate their job.  It depends on how busy they are i think.  \n\nThere are a few items that are limited to one order per person...the uni, amaebi and hamachi kama.  This is understandable considering it's more on the expensive side.  If you love these items, go with someone who doesn't that way you can have their share too!   \n\nSave room for dessert because they have tempura ice cream and it is delicious!  Just a hint of tempura batter so it doesn't over power the ice cream...i wonder how do you fry ice cream?  \n\nIf you are a sushi lover and want a great all you can eat experience, you have to come here.  I wish and wish that they would open one up in SF and HI so I don't have to fly to Vegas just to enjoy good quality AYCE sushi.  \n\nTIP:  No reservations and the line can get long so come early or just place your name on the list...they call your phone when your table is ready!"

Have to update my review as I'm not sure how I feel about this place anymore... \n\nBetween  November 2015 and now (January 2016) my boyfriend and I have gotten AYCE here about 5 times. Our last two times were not as great as the first three, so we will probably be finding a new sushi place ): \n\nOur first bad experience - We came with our friends in the middle of the day and sat at a table instead of the sushi bar like we usually do. The service was slower, some of the rolls tasted a little different than usual, however, overall, still a good experience! Until they brought the check out before they even brought out our friends ice creams. We reminded them that we only received half of the desserts we ordered, so they cashed us out and then brought the ice cream. OK, no harm, no foul. My boyfriend and I had finished our ice cream and our friends were still finishing theirs and drinking their hot green tea. However, since we had payed at this point, they asked us to leave so they could \"get the table ready for the next guest\" (!!) I was a little disappointed by this as we already felt rushed when they brought the check out before the dessert. Not to mention there was not a long wait at this point (only one family who had just walked in, and clearly we were about to be finished and leave, just finishing up drinks), and we would have gladly moved to the bar while our friends finished their teas and then left. The whole situation just felt rude and I was disappointed that we had raved about this place to our friends, asked them to come here with us, only for us to get kicked out at the end of our meal! It was pretty rude and we wouldn't have tipped so well if we knew they were going to treat us like that...\n\nWhile that left a pretty bad taste in my mouth, we decided it was probably just a fluke on the hosts part and wanted to give this place another try, especially since we have never had bad service before! So we came around noon and went to the bar like usual, the place was already pretty full this time, even though they just opened. The usual sushi chef we have (I forget his name, but he is hispanic, very friendly man and super good at his job!) was not here this day. The chef we got was super slow and the rolls didn't taste the same as usual (fish wasn't as fresh maybe? or chef used different ingredients? I'm not sure). He also wasn't very personable, whereas the other chef was always saying hello, asking how you liked the roll, and cracking jokes! It wasn't all on the sushi chef, though, because our edamame came out from the kitchen burnt! The server, nonetheless, plopped it down in front of us. Even the nigiri tasted different, and sub-par, which is usually so fresh and my favorite thing here!\n\nI will probably give this place one last try, however I don't have high hopes after my last two experiences here. Looks like we will just have to find a new sushi spot. /:\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR -\nUsed to love this place, last two experiences have not been as great. Check came before dessert so we were rushed through it, then asked to leave to 'clear the table for the next guest' even though our friends were still finishing up. Gave it one more shot and sushi wasn't fresh, edamame came out burnt, and food was just all-around sub-par."

There are REALLY BAD all-you-can-eat sushi places, and there are REALLY GOOD all-you-can-eat sushi places. There is very few in-betweens, and really, why would you want to settle for less? you're better than that. LET'S HAVE SOME SELF RESPECT!\nSushi Mon is one of those REALLY GOOD ayce places. I know most of my ayce sushi reviews have been 4 to 5 stars...but have you ever wondered why? because I don't settle, and neither should you! But after going to sushi mon, i dont know man. It's really raising the bar. (Although nothing beats Kami. http://www.yelp.com/biz/kami-tustin R.I.P Kami.)\n\nThe Food:\nOkay so for your sake and mine, I will keep this brief. Fish quality, yeah it's fresh, real fresh (makes you wonder how they do it...i mean, they are in the dessert afterall...) They have specials that i assume changes daily, and they are amazing. Yellowtail belly? keep em' coming! Conch? hell yes. \nSushi mon have some sushi items that are not on any list i've ever seen.  \nalthough be warned: they put a small, small bit of wasabi to hold the fish to the rice. If you hate that...well...um...\nTHEY HAVE DESSERT! :D It's part of the all you can eat menu. now that's amazing. I think that's what all my girlfriend ate...\n\nher: \"baby can you order me red bean ice cream?\" \nher: \"baby can you order me another green tea ice cream? oh! with strawberry mochi ice cream please!\" \nMe: \"excuse me miss, can i get another strawberry mochi ice cream please? and an order of tempura ice cream for myself-\"\nher: \"oh i want one of those too!\" \nme: \"...make that two.\"\nStory of my life...by the way, lychee sorbet, talk about a home run. and i don't even play baseball. \n\nThey have an extensive appetizer menu, that's all on the list for all you can eat, which really sets them apart from a lot of places. Salmon Collar? bring me like 20 please.\n\nTo really go the extra mile (which is also ironic because we drove 200+ miles to get to vegas...I think i'm using irony wrong) , they have this topping menu that you can order from to accompany any of your orders. Quail egg, masago, orgasm sauce...dont ask. I didnt. \n(Just like my underwear, this section wasn't really brief, now was it?)\n\n*notice i didn't really talk about the rolls. :x my buddies went at that, i stuck to the nigiri. beause i'm a hipster. whateeeever*\n\nThe Service:\nI'm more use to the aptly named \"southern california\" version of all you can eat sushi, which refers to a checklist that you can give to the waitress. Why Sushi Mon or Oyshi never adapted to this is beyond me. It makes life so much easier! But in both Sushi Mon and Oyshi, their waiters and waitresses will go up to you and write down what you're ordering. Needless to say, that poor lady was standing at our table for a good 10 minutes taking our orders. \n\nYou come here. Come here now. Oh what? you can't decide between a vegas-style buffet, Oyshi, or Sushi Mon? \n\nFIRST WORLD PROBLEMS."

All was very good, and came out quick too. Bonus for AYCE is you can do half rolls... Allows for more variety so why not?\n\nThe service was pretty quick and the sushi chefs were super friendly. I can't say that it's the best sushi I've had in town - but it seems pretty darn good for a strip mall in Henderson. I'd definitely be up for sushi mon again, not sure I can fill up their buy 10 get one free AYCE card though, that just seems a little implausible to me... But hey, you give it a try."

We spent almost an hour in the restaurant, all ordering AYCE, and were only able to order twice. Once upon arrival, and once for dessert. What a sham. We kept trying to flag down the waiter (this place is tiny, so there shouldn't have been an issue) and he was just too busy for us, apparently. We requested a hot tea refill 3 separate times to no avail. The nigiri that I was able to get to the table was great, fresh scallop had a pine flavor to it - strange. Our friends had many rolls - they ordered everything they wanted in the first order, and asked later on why we ordered so little. We explained that with AYCE, you're supposed to order little by little so you don't over-order. They have clearly eaten here so often that they knew you only really had one solid chance of getting your order in. Sad. \n\nWe won't be back to this locaton. We'll stick with the other Sushi-Mon and Goye-mon along with other faves in the valley."

So after a while my hubby see see to open tables at the bar & so we decide to sit. They bring our drinks, we put in an order & after about 10 minutes one of the servers come over & asks us who sat us. My husband was like we did. Now at this point we've been seated for about 10 minutes & I need a refill on my water. The server tells us that we have to get up because there is a waiting list. While this is going on the people behind us were also arguing with a different server because they sat their party on a table that does not really fit his party.\nAnyway, my hubby is asking the guy if he's serious. The server looks at the owner and says yes but we can add you to the waiting list. My mouth completely dropped.  I could not believe as we are enjoying our dinner they want us to stop & step out but still want us to come back. We will never come back. Never did they say sorry. We are so unbelievably shocked at their service & attitude we will never go back!!!!! My husband has just about told the story to everyone he knows!! He's in sales & it's now a part of every conversation he has. It's too bad. I use to like it there. And the only reason I'm giving one star is because I USE TO like it there!!! Shame on them"

The service was very attentive and my friend commented this was the best waiter she's had in all the times she's been here. I was happy to see they had my two favorite items on the Ayce menu. They are hamachi kama and baked mussels! Yummy! Only downside is you are limited to one order of the hamachi kama. Ordered a bunch of nigiri and several more hot apps. Loved the unagi and super white tuna. Both fried and steamed gyoza were delish as the skin was nice and thin just the way I like it! Finished off with Mochi ice cream and lychee sorbet. Very refreshing! I was nervous about the one hour time limit as I am a pretty slow eater. :) they did not enforce the one hour limit. We were there about an hour and a half and no one seemed to be rushing us. Good food. Good service. Great company. I was a happy girl. Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu!"

As I'm writing this review I'm craving it again...\n\nI really like their fried calamari - it's lightly seasoned, fresh, and served with a hint of sauce over a small bed of lettuce.\n\nHere's a tip:  Order from the specials board 1st because items sell out quickly. Be sure to pay attention to the different colored stars since they indicate if you can order 1 per person or more.\n\nMy favorite for years was hamachi (yellow tail), but Sushi Mon's super white has taken over. So delicate, fresh, and tender. The halibut is also really nice with just a tiny hint of citrus (I think?).\n\nI also usually love the Sexy Girl (I order a half roll), but the Crispy Rice with spicy tuna will definitely be a repeat.\n\nI always forget my punch card, so thank you for stamping my receipt.

As soon as I walked through the door and was about to sit down, my brother said that the male servers already had given them a hard time. It was originally just my brothers that were  gonna have sushi and they invited me to join them. They told the guy server that they were adding one more person and the server said \"why didn't you tell me earlier that you were adding on more person?!\" My brothers then replied telling him that \"I just literally got off the phone and it wasn't even planned!\" So the server moved my brothers to a bigger table. (Strike one!) \n\nSo they ordered 5mins prior to my arrival. And the server took my order as well. The first two orders came on and the other male server just dropped it down on our table like he was sorta throwing it towards us and told us what it was. He also had an order for the table next to us and he placed their order nicely on their table and explaining nicely to them what their order was. (Strike two!!)\n\nThe rest of food came and ate, ordered more trying to pace ourselves. The thing that bothered us also was that it took awhile for the server(s) to come take our orders and clean the plates off and refill our water. And it wasn't even that busy. (Strike three!)\n\nAll in all our experience there was terrible. Don't get me wrong but the food was good and the service sucked! The only one we thought was decent was the one female server.

The counter where we were sitting hasn't really been wiped off it was still dirty and grungy from the previous diners. \n\nSeemed like the sushi chef was angry with me specifically because I asked the server to get us some wasabi and ginger.

It is impossible to try everything here even on multiple visits since they always have new offerings. Your options are close to 100 and include hot items like baked mussels and gyoza and desserts like mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream.  You can order half rolls too so you can try more of a variety.  I have never seen fresh scallops, sweet shrimp, uni, halibut, and sometimes toro all  on a AYCE menu.  The best part of it all is lunch is about $27 with tax/tip and dinner is just a few bucks more!  I am sure we easily would pay double since they amount of food and the quality is on par with $100 sushi experience at any of my normal spots in the South Bay.  On top of this they give you a punch card so after 10 AYCEs you get one for free!  BONUS!!! So yes it is worth the trip, the gas, and the experience!"

(I only clarify AYCE because when I was reading reviews it took me a good half hour to figure out what it meant) So the bf and I went to get our sushi on and we were not disappointed.\n\nYou have an hour to eat all the sushi you can and trust me, it's enough.  We were seated at the sushi bar, always a good place to be, and we gave our orders directly to the head sushi chef. You can order any nigiri, rolls, they have specials on the walls, as well as anything from chicken teriyaki to shrimp tempura on their side menu.  I didn't wanna waste any time on anything but the sushi though.\n\nOne of the things I LOVE is that you can order half rolls, which was great because that way you can try more things without getting ridiculously full.  So my boyfriend and I dove in ordering some toro, sweet shrimp, yellowtail, and albacore.  It was all good.  I know you worry that all you can eat = poor quality, but that is not the case here.  They have great cuts of fish along with yummy rice.  Then we started experimenting with the rolls.  \n\nI ate to the point where I almost needed to throw up.  I considered going to the bathroom and throwing up just so I could eat more. Then I resolved not to be bulimic and came back to the bar where my boyfriend was a trooper and managed to order dessert.  \n\nI have to say, if I had only 1 meal in Vegas, I would spend it here.  I wish they had a sushi mon in LA, I'd probably get mercury poisoning from going everyday."

This is our \"Go-To\" restaurant everytime we're in Vegas visiting my parents. If you've eaten here, you know why, if you haven't...well let me tell you... \n\nTHIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST SUSHI RESTAURANTS YOU'LL EVER GO TO IN YOUR LIFE. \n\n- First of all, the fish is flown in FRESH, from the west coast, the Gulf and sometimes Hawaii, daily. \n- They don't 'skimp' on their portions. (If it's too much, you can place 1/2 an order upon request) \n- For $26.00 / person, you'll definitely get your money's worth! (If you know how to order)\n- You can also order from the kitchen menu (hot items) You're not limited to ONLY sushi. \n- It also helps if you haven't eaten much (or at all) all day. But try not to \"over order\" since you must finish what you order. \n- You can share within your party, as long as whoever you share with ordered the buffet as well. \n\nSome of my \"Sushi Mon favorites\" are the Garlic Tuna (nigiri), the Sushi Monster (huge) & the Toro (1 order / person). Other than those, I'll order the usual: Hamachi roll, Tekka maki, 9-1-1 roll, Rainbow roll...etc... \n\nCan't forget dessert either, oh yeah it's included...I usually go for the Tempura Ice cream...make that 2 orders... \n\nLike I said, if you know what / how to order, you'll definitely get your money's worth... But hold on...there are some drawbacks.\n\n- Wait time can be horrendous!!! Show up as soon as they open, preferably with a party smaller than 6.\n- You have to finish what you order. They're really anal about you eating the rice that goes along with the fish.\n- I think they're only open for dinner now (5pm - 2am) They still might serve lunch at the Sahara location.\n\nEither way, I'll stick to my guns and name this place the best sushi spot I know of...and being born and raised on an island, I know my fresh fish."

I have witnessed a really bad scene once where a man stated he was too embarrassed to finish his meal because of they way they were watching him and accussing him of sharing his all you can eat menu with his family.  It was ridiculous on both Sushi Mon's part and the mans part.  \n\nBut all in all, all you can eat sushi..is bomb.  Their sushi tastes fresh and they have an awesome side menu to order things like seaweed salad, miso soup, tempura shrimp, yellowtail collar, baked mussels, beef teriyaki, and shumai which is all also all you can eat.  This is the place to go when you are hungry and its open pretty late.  Last call is at 1:30am.  Price is about $27 per person.  To me...good deal because I can eat way more sushi over that price.  \n\nPlus you have all you can eat dessert ;) green tea ice cream, mochi balls, red bean ice cream.....man.

It's a pretty small location and with the amount of interest, this place gets packed and wait times can range from 10 min to 90 min+.  On our last trip there, we had a party of six and what disturbed us the most was that seating was not on a first come first served basis for larger groups.  You would expect the staff to hold tables that are next to each other and almost nearly closing out to fit a larger group but that was not the case.  Groups of four was being seated before us and we had to wait for a larger table that would normally fit six.  We had to wait almost 90+ minutes before we got a table.  My recommendation is to get there before they open which I believe is 11am or after 2pm when it starts to die down.  \n\nThe food there is awesome!  Nothing to complain about.  Try anything that catches your eye.  My top picks are the white tuna, garlic ahi, ama ebi, unagi, masago w/ qual eggs, calamari, shrimp tempura, etc.  \n\nIt looks like they opened another location so we'll most likely try that place out when we're back in town."

But make sure you are hungry so you can make it worth your $$$. I usually make it for the dinner AYCE $26.95 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ibuDLfx8gEhESAufYIySw?select=9_pI9y20Kn09CRshWLU6hg) and it is truly worth every cent. The food is awesome and there are a wide range of choices. Also, take a look at the specials (some are 1 p/p). Some of my usual nigiri favs are: fresh salmon, seared ahi, yum yum scallop, snow crab meat, salmon belly (special)(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ibuDLfx8gEhESAufYIySw?select=4gmQ0WpBwpKHKyaLykWCYA), negitoro (special), striped jack (special), hamachi, & cajun salmon (special). I love that the fish is wrapped all the way around the little bit of rice. Hot items I like are: dynamite, shrimp tempura, hamachi kama (special) & the mussels. For dessert, get as much in your tummy as possible, it's all good! From tempura ice cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ibuDLfx8gEhESAufYIySw?select=aqikDFl8ktJdqzKo1gPWaw) to mochi cream, you cannot go wrong.  Try and get whatever you can finish, but don't forget you must follow the rules (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ibuDLfx8gEhESAufYIySw?select=S1dW_5Y-w3NYn-efOyaQEg).\nThe service we had at both Sushi Mon locations was awesome, but I must give props to the Maryland Pkway location because they took our # and called us when our table was ready so we could shop around the area for a little bit. We sat at the sushi bar & Chef Mike was very attentive and helpful. There's a ton of parking and the one-person-bathroom is very clean. \nAll in all, Sushi Mon is affordable, fun, delicious, and a winner. Banzai!"

We had even made alternate dinner plans with our friends on the Strip, just in case.  It was a week night and pretty early 5:30 pm so there was a lot of room for our party of 5.  The waitstaff seemed a little standoffish at first, but after we ordered they were very quick to refill our hot tea and check on us.  3 of our family members ordered entrees.  The portions were huge and looked tasty.  My husband and I ordered the AYCE and were very surprised to see that there were so many choices for both rolls and negri.  We ordered several rolls both standard (spider, spicy tuna, yellow tail) and specialty (Vegas a go go)  We were delighted to taste fresh fish.  We ordered till our mercury levels were off the charts and then the sea called and asked us to pace ourselves for fear they could not generate enough fish for the rest of the world.  We left satisfied and happy.  I do appreciate their 20% charge if you do not finish the sushi you order.  I also appreciate the 1 hour limit on AYCE except if I was going to be held by it...I am not sure if its really busy that AYCE is worth it if you only have an hour."

Sat at the bar and ordered the all you can eat in which the customer is timed at 45 mins to eat. Dinner started off bad because I ordered a roll and the sushi chef drowned it in a sweet sauce. And when I say drowned, the bottom of the plate showed no white. I told the sushi guy that I didn't want the roll because he drowned it in sweet sauce. He accused me putting too much soy sauce. Really!? My meal was ruined, I ate the most basic califorrnia and philly rolls, had my plum icecream and peaced the place out. Truly, truly disappointed. Not to mention, the fish was not well kept."

We ordered 4 orders of 6 types of nigiri and it was sitting on our table in 5 minutes tops.  I really enjoyed the garlic tuna nigiri and the cajun albacore nigiri and make it one of my frequent orders that day.  Didn't want to order any rolls because I was more focused on hitting up the nigiri and making sure to get my monthly nigiri fix.  My buddy ordered 5-6 orders of uni sushi (usually one order per person at other sushi spots) as well and got it just as fast as I did!  The food was pretty fresh and my group and I left super full from definitely stuffing ourselves with all the yummyness we could.\n\nOn a side note, we had to wait for 4 hours, but with the AYCE price this low and one hour of AYCE madness, I wasn't suprised or mad BECAUSE IT'S $10 DOLLARS!!  Just because some people don't have patience and/or didn't make an effort to come down earlier does NOT mean that Sushimon deserves a 1-star for not catering to you.  They took the price cut to give the public a nice treat and were simply overwhelmed with the response.  Yet, they turned up the production to 11 and kept the event going as best as they could.  No one was entitled to the $10 AYCE price and I definitely didn't feel like I was.  I came in as soon as possible, waited my turn, and got to enjoy the event as intended.\n\nI give them 5 stars for dropping their price low, good foods, and giving us the best service they could while dealing with snooty ungrateful people.  Definitely stopping by again; Sushimon has made a customer out of me."

Came in around 12pm and ordered lots of half-order baked rolls and fancy sushi. The raw fish, esp. the yellowtail, was very fresh. The strawberry mochi was also very impressive as a dessert. \nBased on my previous experience, I gave it a second try last week during lunch time. However I found that there must be something different... I can tell the sushi was made differently, although all the chefs were the same. When I pick up the sushi, the rice fell apart easily. I was not sure if it's because the chef did not make the roll correctly, or the rice was not made for sushi at all. But with the price they charge, it is not supposed to happen (especially it's made by Japanese chefs!). The chef lapsed our order several times even when we were sitting at the sushi bar. Even if the raw fish was still fresh, I was feeling so different that I have to gave it only 3-start this time. \nC'mon sushi mon, you fish deserves 5-star, what happened to your sushi rice??"

I love this place b/c the sushi is super fresh and well prepared.  You can tell by examining the cuts of salmon -- Sushi Mon's salmon is some of the best I've had.  If you're not w/ a big group, I would suggest sitting at the bar b/c you can request orders directly to the sushi chef w/o having to tell the waiters/waitresses.  Sushi Mon has the special rolls, but I love the plain sashimi on nigiri rice rolls.  You have to try the salmon, tuna, and surf clam.  A specialty this restaurant has that no other place has is the sea urchin and sweet shrimp on rice.  These are only served at dinner and you can only order one order per person per all you can eat check.  It's sooooo good mainly b/c the cuts are so fresh.  If you are a newbie to Sushi Mon, please come at dinner time to request the sea urchin and sweet shrimp -- you will not regret it.  Another dish I recommend is the baked mussels -- phenomenal.  You have to try this!!!!"

However, I have also been missing out on my sushi runs and finally had the opportunity for some raw fish this past weekend.\n\nHaving been to their sister restaurant on Sahara, I was familiar with Sushi Mon's all-you-can-eat menu.  For $29.95, you have an hour to chow down on nigiri, rolls, appetizers, tempura, and dessert.  For those not wanting to participate in the race, you can order from their a la carte menu as well.  \n\nFor such limited items like Amaebi (don't forget to ask for the fried heads that come with them!) and Uni, it's only one order (a pair) per person.  Otherwise, diners like myself would have them running out of that stuff quick!  I also had some of their nigiri, and their specialty rolls - 9-1-1 Roll, Spider Roll, and Pixie Roll among others.  I had a better experience with their Hamachi Collar this time compared to my experience at the other Sushi Mon.  Order half orders on the rolls so you can try more out and aren't stuck with 8 pieces all to yourself! \n\nAnd for dessert - I like their Plum Sherbet, Lychee Sherbet, and Green Tea Ice Cream.  I never made it around to their Mochi this time unfortunately.\n\nUpdate! 09/14/07 - I made the mistake of ordering their Spider Roll which is huge and filled with crab meat filler!  Blah!  Be sure to ask what their daily fish specials are.  They had bonito and live scallops when we went, and the scallop was pretty good.  Their scallop nigiri is cooked scallop, which is something I didn't really care for.  I got a chance to try their Mochi Vanilla this time, yum!  I think I did a good job of eating my fill!\n\nSidenote: They offer frequent eater cards!  Eat 10 times there and get one free!  They don't take reservations! \n\nUpdate! 03/11/08 - I finally tried their vanilla mochi and it was yummy.  Forgot to check what their daily fish specials were, which was probably a big mistake. Their ahi poke has nice cuts of tuna and seaweed mixed together, add a bit of soy to it though."

As we have since expanded our search to other local spots around town, it's taken a serious hit on the sushi meter as it just cannot compare anymore.\n\nWhile their nigiri remains high in quality and freshness (albeit the portions have gotten noticeably smaller), their rolls are not particularly interesting. A great deal of the rolls contain crab stick which irks me. A lot of \"crab,\" a lot of cucumber, a lot of tuna. Nothing different or special. They are also very dry. This negatively impacts the experience if you're not feasting on AYCE nigiri alone, as I've sometimes been tempted to do. \n\nOur chef didn't seem too enthusiastic either. I hate sitting at the sushi bar feeling like I'm bothering he chef. I'm aware the chef-customer dynamic is different in AYCE than in traditional and authentic sushi settings, but maybe a smile when we order? Perhaps asking once or twice if we'd like anything else? \n\nIt's nice having a choice for all those late-night sushi cravings, but Sakana still wins in my book for best AYCE in Las Vegas."

My wife and I decided to give this place a try since it is just down the street of our new apartment and we were hoping it would make for a good alternative to our usual sushi place, Yama. Afterwards we decided it was an OK place, but the extra drive to Yama was worth it for the better quality food. \n\n\n\nOk, so the good parts first I think... first, all you can drink soda was a plus, most sushi places will just give you a can of soda but this place gave nice big glasses. Servers were also very quick on the refills, and since I can down a glass of soda or water very quickly during a meal I kept out waiters busy, lol.\n\nWe both got the AYCE at the sushi bar and once we got the attention of our sushi chef started ordering. Most of the food was OK, the baked green mussels were about average while the garlic albacore was delicious. My wife absolutely loved their special \"Sushi Bon\" dish, one of their new specials. For dessert my wife and I also recommend the lychee sorbet, very tasty. Sadly this just about ends the positive portion of this review.\n\nOk, now for the problems. Other than the refills, service was slow as hell here. It took the chef about 20 minutes per item, longer if it was baked. At first I thought it was just because of the crowd, but even once it started emptying in the restaurant it remained painfully slow. This is despite the large number of sushi chefs on duty at the time as well! \n\nAs for the majority of the sushi itself it was nothing all the great. We tried a number of different items and found most of them to be a bit bland. Also, they all seemed to be variations of the same thing (and not a good thing at that). Presentation was a bit lacking as well, nearly every dish we had looked rushed and fell apart while we were trying to eat it. They had an item which was a variation of a dynamite roll that we ordered, it looked like they had skimped on the toppings, then when we went to eat it the thing turned to mush before we could take a bite. Most of the food was like this, either it fell apart or didn't seem to be cooked right or something just wasn't right. Really a let down for the evening. \n\nAll in all it was an OK experience, the plain sushi was yummy and I enjoyed a small number of the rolls, but the bulk of it was just not what I would consider quality sushi. How it got this busy and such a good rating is a mystery to me. But they do have a huge selection and if you are willing to brave some of the more interesting rolls then give it at least one try, you might find it is more to your tastes than my own."

The first sushi chef we had took our order no problem but then he left and after we finished eating our first round we decided to order some more... I tried to order some nigiri from this older Asian man with glasses and he completely ignored me, then I finally got his attention and asked if we could get aburi salmon (which is salmon nigiri with spicy mayo on top and then seared with a torch) \"not that big of a deal right?\" Well this sushi chef gave me a dirty look when I asked for it and then continued to make sushi without even acknowledging that he would make my order. Finally we get the nigiri and all he did was sear the salmon half way too hell with no spicy mayo on top. When we finished eating that we still had room for more so we tried ordering from this guy again and now he doesn't even respond back. He is literally ignoring me while I'm sitting right in front of him, so we have to order from one of the waiters that walked by and when we asked to order the waiter said \"you know you can order through the sushi chef?\" to which I responded \"I would but he's ignoring us\" and the waiter did not seem surprised when I told him that. Oh and to make things even better I also heard they recently got a c rating with 33 demerits... Nasty!

For some reason we hadn't been in 3 years and decided to dine there tonight.  I went with a friend and my 3 year old son.  My son does not like anything that is typically offered on a sushi menu so I packed a juice box and a plastic bag with something he would eat.  Our server mentioned that it was their policy not to allow outside food and told us that if my son were to eat or drink what I brought we would be asked to leave.  I tried to order a drink for my son (juice or milk) and was told they only carried soft drinks or lemonade.  I didn't want to cause a scene so between sushi rolls I took my 3 year old outside to eat his meal.  It was tough to explain to my son why he had to eat outside in the 105 degree heat.  The most frustrating part of this evening is when we explained to another employee why we were feeding him outside she said that she had never heard of such a policy.  \n\nI was also disappointed in the service we received.  We tried to flag the waiter down for drink refills multiple times with no luck.  Luckily the hostess had a pitcher of water and could at least keep our waters topped off.  There appeared to be plenty of servers and ours did not look overworked but we were not given much attention\n\nThe sushi wasn't bad but not like I remember it.

We order a few sashimi, a screaming orgasm, and 4 rolls, which came out to 80 bucks! I seriously contemplate just waiting the 45 min and having all you can eat for about $50 plus tip for the two of us. \n\n15-20 min later, they pack up our stuff and we drive home. We get home and they give us one roll that's the wrong order and then they're missing 2. So we give them a call, they say they have the food at the counter...we don't live a minute down the street so my husband asks the manager if he can just refund us what the two rolls cost. They offer to give him a 26 dollar credit the next time we go, + another $13 and not a refund. My husband insisted that we wanted the refund and they made him drive back instead of just putting it back on his card. So he goes there and gets the refund...and, I would think for the trouble, they would just give us the two rolls we originally ordered but forgot. Nope. What horrible customer service.

And dessert is good, too!  I am IN LOVE with tempura fried ice cream, and this does not disappoint.  Next time I am gonna see if I can get green tea ice cream up in that tempura shell... mmm."

Honestly, I was really disappointed. The tables are almost stacked on top of each other when you are seated. I could have rubbed elbows with the table next to me. The fish was not fresh when I was there, which was a big bummer. I'm not sure why everyone is raving about the menu selection, because this place had the smallest selection of the 4 I have been to. They are quick to get the rolls out to you, but quick isn't always good. The quality definitely wasn't there. I think most people like this place because it's convenient, but outside of that you should go elsewhere."

It's also nice that when you do All-you-can-eat, your nigiri rice isn't packed in so big/tight that it's basically a rice cake under a thin layer of fish. \n\nAaaaannnnddd you can eat here till like 1 or 2 am.

Was told that there was an hour wait for a party of six when there were two empty tables right in front of us.  After suggesting he combine the two, the greeter (Taku?) said the best he can do is to separate us - three ayce at the bar and the three kids at a table.  Are you kidding me?  How much does a little common sense cost us now a days huh?  They're kids for crying out loud!\n\nWhy I decided to stay is beyond me.  The service here is painfully slow.  Ordered two chicken katsu combos and a chicken teriyaki bowl for the kids and seriously, it took them 15 minutes to come out with the miso soup alone!  You can just imagine how long it took them to come out with their food.   Also, the wait time for our sushi was just the same if not longer.  Seriously, waiting more than 30 minutes for food is just too much.  Chop, chop!\n\nSo ayce... You can't share food, I get it.  But when my 5-year-old nephew wants a bite of my ice cream, gosh dang it, he can have a bite of my ice cream.  The need for our server, Jean, to act like it's the end of the world is just crazy.

I'm am typically a sashimi guy and not a big fan of paying  for mostly rice nigiri, but what the hey nigiri it was. started with some of my favorites uni and ama-ebi naturally they are on the limited to one order list, but thats cool. The Uni was to say the least not at its peak freshness, in fact most normal sushi bars that i frequent would not have served it. Moved on to the hamachi and tuna, edible but not very fresh. Tried the 911 roll it was ok but not nearly as spicy as I would have liked. My associate ordered a spider roll, which the menu claimed was fresh softshell crab (as you would expect) it came out with 2 small crab legs hanging out of each end and a lot of \"Krab\" in the middle, when asked the sushi chef admitted that fake krab was used we pointed out the menu was wrong and sent the roll back, which seemed to offend the chef. If they write fresh crab on the menu and give you Krab, they need to expect that!\nAll in all it was a very mediocre or worse sushi experience, but it was cheap! \nThe only reason that I gave 2 stars instead of 1 was the Hamachi Kama which was very good, but sadly also on the limited to one list.

My last experience of AYCE sushi was HORRIBLE.  I never felt so sick in my life and had to hang out in the bathroom for the rest of the night. Yeah, you can say I was scarred from AYCE joints from that experience.  \n\nWith that said, my brother told me he loves this place and takes all his visitors here for dinner.  My brother has a waaaaay more sensitive stomach than I do. If he loves this place and doesn't get sick from it, then I'm sure I can tolerate it.  \n\n$28 is not a bad deal for AYCE sushi.  Originally I thought this place was going to be buffet-style but get this: they make it fresh for you once you put in your order! Ummm how great is that??  So I felt a lot better once I found that out.\n\nI tried to sample a variety of dishes served at Sushi Mon.  Between my brother, his fiancee and I, this is what I remember ordering:\n\nSeared salmon nigiri\nEvery time I dine at a kaiten restaurant, I always order a few plates of this.  I thought it was interesting how they presented this dish because they sear the underside of the salmon.  And yes, I thought the the texture and taste was good.\n\nGarlic tuna nigiri\nThe only other place I can compare this to is Genki Sushi and Sushi Mon does it a lot better.  I like how there's enough garlic to compliment the taste of the tuna, rather than overwhelm it.  \n\nEcstasy Roll\nThis roll contains chopped albacore, avocado and tempura crumb wrapped with tuna, smelt eggs & seaweed salad drizzled with orgasm sauce. Yeah, you heard that right, orgasm sauce.  I dunno what orgasm sauce is (or if I wanna know) but that with the entire roll was delicious.  I liked the texture the tempura crumbs added to the roll as well.\n\nSupreme Salmon roll\nSalmon wrapped with rice, nori and...more salmon!? This was an instant hit with me but I had to deduct a half star because I found a fish bone in one of the rolls.\n\nBaked mussels\nThese were pretty good, although I thought there was a little too much mayo and cheese topping it.\n\nSushi Mon Lasagna\nTo clarify, this contains scallop yum and cucumber spread with yum yum sauce & cream cheese.  All I can say is there was way too much yum yum.  This roll was a bit rich for my liking.  I'll pass on this the next time I visit.\n\nSaba\nI thought it was ok and it seemed like it didn't taste as \"oily\" as I remember it to be.  I hope that makes sense to you all...\n\nUni\nDuring dinner, they only allow one order of uni per person. I can totally see why...this tasted so fresh!  I was tempted to have someone order me another round but we still had a lot of food to finish.  For those of you who wonder what this tastes like, it reminds me of the fat of dungeness crabs (aka the best part of the crab).  If you still think it sounds gross, you are so missing out.\n\nGrilled yellow tail collar\nCooked to perfection! The meat easily fell off the bones and I enjoyed the tenderness of the fish and the crispiness of the outside.\n\nLychee sorbet\nBest lychee sorbet I've tasted.  This also contained chunks of lychee fruit in it. Mmmm...\n\nStrawberry mochi\nMost of the time when I had this at other restaurants, this is frozen rock hard.  Sushi Mon's mochi was nice and soft while the ice cream in the inside was slightly firm.  Another good choice for dessert.\n\nI apologize if this review was ridiculously long.  Anyways, I personally think it's worth the trip to dine here at Sushi Mon."

I arrived with three friends at 450pm, they told us at the door that it was going to be a 7 to 8 HOUR wait.. and he \"hoped\" that it would only be that long... Not only has Sushi Mon lost three potential customers from trying them for the first time they have lost 3 customers for life... good job!"

I couldn't wait to get it home since I was starving.\n\nWe ate the sushi first and that was good like always. Next came the chicken teriyaki... everything was fine until I got to the last piece of chicken. It had a bone in it and I bit down hard on it and I felt the pain in my tooth. I immediately spit it out and ran to the bathroom mirror. I didn't see any damage but I can still feel a slight pain. \n\nI just hope they are more careful in the future. I will continue to get take out from there but I think I'll just stick with the sushi rolls.\n\nI would have given them four stars but I deducted one star for the chicken bone."

Now that i've been finished with school my ability to consume half the oceans supply of fish has greatly diminished but nonetheless I still can hammer time quite a fair amount of sushi.\n\nAtmosphere/service: Fairly busy with an attentive sushi bar but as for the male wait staff it could be much better.  The decor resembles that of an older sushi restaurant that's been in business and Sushi mon has definitely been one of the lasting pioneers for sushi.\n\nFood: I only eat nigiri and will share a roll with a friend. That being said, the quality of the fish is more important and essentially thats what sushi is, is the nigiri. I'm a yellowtail fiend and typically the first 2 orders are incredibly fresh with a beautiful dark pink to clear color. The chefs here are Japanese trained and cut the nigiri with just the right amount of thickness and low rice to fish ratio. They have implemented a new white chef who (no offense) cuts the nigiri poorly.\n\nOverall: Quiet nights when I just want to enjoy sushi alone, this is the place I choose. Fresh nigiri, professional sushi chefs, and proximity to my home makes this a winner"

To be perfectly honest, I have very mixed feelings about it.  It's a small space and seemingly always busy, but we were lucky and got two spots right away at the sushi bar.  Our sushi chef was quick and friendly, and the fish he served us  was beautifully cut and arranged.  We started off with a bunch of orders of nigiri: tuna, salmon, super white tuna, albacore, yellow tail, snapper, all of which were fresh and delicious.  I really wanted a roll with soft shell crab but they only had 2. I ordered the Spider Roll and I was sorely disappointed.  It was huge, but full of the imitation crab meat and a lot of rice and barely any soft shell crab inside.  Of course, I had to eat it all anyway since AYCE.  \n\nOur sushi chef left to go on break so another chef took over. We went back to ordering nigiri and the pieces he served were comical. One small, one big, one cut in half in the middle...really, as a sushi chef, he should have been embarrassed to be putting out pieces like this.  The rest of our meal proceeded in this fashion, with very tiny ugly looking pieces of fish.  I know I know, it all tastes the same, but sorry, I expect my sushi to look pretty, too. Our last dish was the dynamite, which took forever and it was overcooked so the scallops were a little tough.  \n\nWe ended our meal with delicious mochi in mango, strawberry and vanilla flavors.  I would say that overall the service was great and the food was good.  Not my favorite sushi joint, but I'd go back because I like the atmosphere and it's close to my house."

It's $25 for all you can eat, made to order sushi. We had that for lunch and although she told us that she would probably have to hold us to the 45 minute rule (they have you cut you off after 45 minutes), we didn't feel pressured at all the entire time we were there and we were definitely still eating after 45 minutes. We probably got by with an hour and then just hung out and talked after that. \n\nEverything was good, and what I like about this place is that you can order almost everything off the menu, they don't limit you to a certain section or items because of AYCE. You can get rolls at half the size, so you can try things you normally wouldn't order. They have a variety of different rolls, with surprisingly good combination of ingredients. The quality of fish is good, not great, but definitely slightly above average for the price. \n\nWe had all the different nigiri sushi, including the cajun albacore which I really liked. Had a little bit of kick with the ponzu flavor. The No Name rolls was pretty good, and I think we had the Athena as well. I say, just go for it, and if you don't want a roll, sometimes they can just do a handroll for you with the same ingredients. We also had a couple of yellowtail collars, edamame, a cucumber salad, and to top it off, we had lychee sorbet (super yummy with lychee jelly mixed in), and tempura ice cream which was made with vanilla ice cream. It was coated in what looked to be pound cake and then deep fried. Or attempted to be deep fried. Either way, I would not get it again. \n\nService was great, and they carefully explained everything and happily took our order. They never made us feel like we could only order the cheaper items because of the AYCE, and service was great throughout. I hope to come back on a future trip to Vegas."

I'd venture to say better than their other location, as I have NEVER had bad service here.

They brought it back and it was perfect. \n\nNow for the fish!!\n\nThe quality of fish at the location, just like the Sahara location, is always good.  I've never had anything that was downright BAD, or off.  \n\nThis trip we had:\n\nSuper white:  my favourite of all time!!  It almost melts in your mouth. \nUnagi:  Yum.

And unlike most sushi buffets that like to give you a high rice/fish ratio for their rolls, this place keeps that ratio relatively low and gives you a decent amount of fish per roll.\n\nThe rolls are decently sized and tasty.  I'm a big fan of spicy tuna rolls (I can hear all the purists groaning) and this place has the \"911 Roll\" which is THE SPICIEST TUNA ROLL EVER.  It's like eating fire wrapped around some tuna, rice and seaweed.  It is beyond brilliant.\n\nIf you're in the Las Vegas area and want to fill up on some quality sushi at a steal of a price, Sushi Mon is the place to be.\n\n+1 for the late hours."

I live on the northwest part of town and willingly travel out here whenever I want some good sushi. The bf invited me for dinner here last night and said \"hell yaa!\" without hesitation. We got the all you can eat for 26 bucks a head.\nHere's a list of things we ordered:\nseared tuna and salmon\nAhi poki\n'fresh' scallop\nYellowtail collar\nShrimp shumai\nTarro(fish of the day)\nSuper white \nEel\nSpicy shrimp yum yum rolls\nGyoza(his order)\nTempura ice cream\n\nOur orders consisted  mostly of nigiris except the shrimp yum yum rolls because we don't like other things on the fish (like cream cheese..eck!) but anyway everything was,as usual, deliciously fresh. Well, except the scallops, it tasted a wee funny. It didn't taste as fresh as they claimed it to be. But the BEST PART was that TARRO !! I can eat three orders if it wasn't limited to one order per person! And the super white is to die for! A must frikken try! They used to limit the order for this before the tarro fish came out and now order as much as you can! Yay! We finished off with the tempura ice cream and satisfaction finally kicked in. \n\nOverall, great food, the staff(servers) actually improved as far as the service, and definitely worth the money."

Very friendly service each time and they don't balk if you go over you 1 hour.

The quality of the fish is great, variety is awesome, and pricing for about $26.95 for adults (one hour time limit) at dinner time (a little less for lunch) is well worth it if you're hungry. \n\nThey have all the usual nigiri favorites and an extensive list of sushi rolls. What blew my mind was the Ikura and Quail Egg...oh baby...my brother-in-law introduced me to this and now it's one of my favorite bites to eat. Needless to say, we had way too many on our last visit.\n\nYou can also order regular Japanese dishes like shrimp/vegetable tempura, hamachi kama, miso soup, and the like...which we did. But it really was the sushi that I enjoyed the most.\n\nThe only slightly disappointing thing we encountered was there's really no kids menu available. Kids 2-years-old and under do eat free, but if you're kids are older than that (like my son) then expect to pay ala carte prices to get that kid fed or splurge on another all-you-can-eat.\n\nOther than that, we had a great time and would definitely return again if we are hungry for good quality sushi off the strip."

It's far enough from the Strip that I doubt most tourists will ever hear about it, but I'm really glad I asked Yelp (and my local friend) where to eat sushi on a Friday night.\n\nSushi Mon does ACYE sushi (all-you-can-eat) the only way you can -- by ordering off a very extensive menu, and ordering more rolls whenever something catches your eye or when you realize you're still hungry. (No stale rolls under buffet glass here!) This only works if the restaurant has great service, and luckily, the wait staff is very prompt here.\n\nIf they still have it on the specials menu, you have to try the pastel roll. Unhealthy, for sure, but oh so yummy.\n\nThe only drawback was waiting for 45+ minutes for our table on a Friday night. In their defense, we were a pretty big group. We ended up killing time by stocking up on snacks and toiletries at the Smith's across the parking lot."

COME TO BUFFETS HYDRATED so you don't have to drink much water either!  I know.. nutrition professional and I'm telling you this..hahaha\n\nStory time: The places opens at 11:45 AM and because a group takes forever to get ready, instead of individuals, we left at 12 PM and got there about 12:15 PM.  BIG MISTAKE!  The rush had already gone through. NOO!  As a result, we had a 40-minute wait.  After meeting with mama-san at Tokyo Discount, we came back in dismay as we had to wait another 30-40 min. Waiting in the sun,..dear god it's winter and I am sweating?  WE'RE STARVVING!  On our death beds, hypoglycemia status..and all I could think about are my sugar levels.  Where is an emergency glucose pill when you need it? After all was done, said, and eaten..i left with gochi o sama deshita!  hontoni, sugoku oishiikatta desu!  The Japanese owner was impressed that I could speak Japanese!  \n\nSynopsis: One word, white tuna sushi!  PURE HEAVEN!  It's like buttaahhhhhhhh without the clogging-feeling aftermath.  I literally came in my pants, no joke.  I came here with all the Vegas crew i met through my BFF.  In total, 8 of us.  The horror beginning of it all, was that we waited more than an hour, and the way they made us wait was horrific, but even with that said, the $28 bucks we spent (18% tip including), was more than worth it.  Hence, 5 stars!  I'm certain their revenue has hit the negative due to our cow-like stomachs.  Would I come here?  HELL YES!!!  Mmm.I can't wait to come back and have Sushi Mon on the side as a bonus feature!\n\nEmployees:  If you can speak Japanese, they will be impressed, especially if you don't look like your Japanese (usually I am told I look Japanese, but being with all Filipinos...it didn't seem so). The lady smiled at me and the cute guy I was with, Keifer, was also impressed. Sumimasen, Atarashi pureto onegaishimasu!  Although the guy who served us didn't have a happy smile on his face.  I totally disregarded that because I was beyond starvation to care.  More to that, our table was demanding because we were ordering like everything on the menu times 5!  Hahaha..  Although in the end, the guy was rude.  After I got my sugar levels back to normal, service seemed to matter more.  He said, \"because there are a lot of people waiting, we need to as you to leave\" even though our EXTRA round of desserts haven't made it to our table.  RUDE!  Too bad, I put the tip in before he said it.  Otherwise, it would have certainly been 10!!!  not to mention...WE WERE WAITING FOR HEIFERS BEFORE THIS TO FINISH EATING!  And their BMIs were about 35...and there were FOUR of them.  RUDE!\n\nParking: Very easy!  I love Vegas for this.  It's not like Hawai'i, where you have to hunt for excruciating amount of time to visit your favorite restaurant.  Although, compared to how many people were there, to the amount of parking, it seemed unjustified and misleading.  Lots of parking, not enough space in the restaurant.  Womp, womp!\n\nCost: For all you can eat, $28 including 18% tip, amazing.  I'm positive we ate the restaurant in the negatives.  I can safely say, each of us ate about $100 worth of food\n\nFood: Where do I even begin!  I didn't care what the names were, they all went into my tummy!  1, 2, 3...Houdini tricks!  All gone in one fell swoop!  Although, the most eye-back rolling, pants creaming goodness was the white tuna.  OMG  Just thinking about it makes me drool with delight.  I honestly hope the next guy I date tastes this good!  My second favorite were the clams soaking in a cheese sauce?  UGH!  OMG!  It was a burst of smooth creamy lovely!  Then of course you have to have the other foods that cause dyslipidemia such as deep-fried oysters? and Shrimp Tempura!  10 each, GONNNNEE!  And then before I pass out from all the food, \"Um...may I have two vanilla mochi ice creams please?\"  \n\nDrinks: Water with lemon!  Cheap flavored water.  Plus you get vitamin C and antioxidants.  Can you please make my lemon bigger?\n\nRating-disclosure: Although the wait was absurd, and the service not glamorous, i still gave this place 5 stars because the food honestly made up for it.  It really did!  And probably because I was with good company.  If to me, service mattered more than the food, I would definitely have given this place 4 stars.  The only thing holding me back is the unfortunate fact that Hawai'i is deprived of awesome all-you-can-eat sushi due to import costs."

The rice to fish portion is reasonable, although just a tag more than I would like and they do require that you eat the rice as well.  But I usually leave small amount of scattered rice pieces here and there and they never said anything.  The quality of fish is suprisingly fresh for an all you can eat place, but of course not as good as the pricier sushi restaurant.  They also have some good rolls there.

The fish was not good quality and very dry. The menu prices are not what you see on your bill. Check your bill cuz the add a bunch of add ons not stayed on the menu or the waiter. For the bill I had to pay, I could have had great quality sushi for that price at a luxury hotel on the strip. Save your time and stay on the strip for good sushi."

It's painful to have to wait until a Vegas trip to fill my belly with this delicious fish (and mochi ice cream)!\n\nThe cuts of fish were above what is typical for an AYCE sushi gig. The scallop nigiri was fresh and tasty. The cut of fish simply named \"white fish\" was really good, too. I could eat unagi anything all day long. \n\nThey have many rolls to experience as well. My personal favorite was the spider roll which was huge, and had the best combo of ingredients and sauces. I like that you can order half orders of rolls, so that you can try a greater variety. \n\nThe desserts were wonderful, too! The vanilla and strawberry mochi ice cream balls were the best. The tempura ice cream ball was next best, and the green tea (wasabi-looking) ice cream came in at a close third place.\n\nThe best part about this place is all of the choices! You get to try such a variety of great-tasting different things, and even experiment with things you've never had the opportunity to try before. \n\nAn entertainment aspect of Sushi Mon is they have some pretty awesome names for their rolls... We had many \"that's what she said\" comments with their creative names, especially the famed \"Monster Roll\". I also can't wait to try multiples of the Orgasm Roll next time! Should be a real treat! ;)"

I'd say something around 20 seats at the bar and about 10 tables.

They weren't picky about having everyone to get all you can it and such so that was cool, but i didn't find our waitress very friendly, and how they just sort of threw the plates on the table over my head to set the food down. I mean its not a big deal but i really wasn't feeling very comfortable to even take bites from my food.  I got Chirashi, its sort of like terriyaki bowl, but instead of chicken i get variety of fish, cut in sashimi style.  it was $13 if i remember correctly and i got a soup and a salad with it.  the quality of the fish wasn't very impressive at all, some of the fish actually seemed very dry in my mouth.  They also threw some pickled mushrooms, and radishes, and a LOT of ginger and wasabi to cover the rice.  It was nicely decorated plate, but i really  didn't like how my fishes weren't fresh.  I also looked over at my friends food, they were huge rolls in many defferent colors, mostly deepfried and cream cheese.  I can see why it could be a cool spot since you can order half of things and try all defferent things, but it just didn't do it for me.  I didn't find my friends plates very appetizing, although it might of tasted good, a lot of the rolls were very similar to one another. I guess next time i should try the all you can eat if i get dragged into that place again.  I've had better experience at different all you can it place in california, but from what i hear its the best all you can eat in las vegas, and i think thats very questionable. although the one on sahara was 3 stars."

We both had the All you can eat and for some reason the waitress kept asking if we would like 1/2 orders, not sure what that was all about, but we declined and got full rolls. Overall pretty good, but I was kind of suspicious when it took just a few minutes for our rolls to arrive. I know there is a whole lot of Sushi guys behind the counter, but how could several rolls with different ingredients come out in a matter of minutes? Pre-made? Say it ain't so! I can't confirm this, but it was kind of odd in all my years of eating Sushi. Some rolls were kind of oversized and you couldn't eat it in a single bite. We had a Spider roll that was softshelll crab on the ends, but the middles seemed to be unrecognizable and oversized. I really like UNI but seems it isn't a popular item and many places are usually out of it. Sushi Mon had it, but the flavor was just a bit off, maybe out of season? I don't know but other Sushi Bars never get UNI as good as it should be. Overall good value for the price. Didn't really have a roll that stood out above the rest and my next visit will be just random ordering since none of the rolls were truly memorable, but still a good effort and we'll be back again for sure."

The medium toro and salmon belly are just so deliciously fresh and melt in your mouth. They're not always on the menu though so be aware of that and if it is, it might be limited to one order/person. The other nigiri sushi like salmon, yellowtail, and white tuna have been my other favorites as well. \n\nI love getting edamame and shrimp tempura here since it's pretty fresh but I've tried the takoyaki and fried gyoza and was disappointed by how soft and full of dough they were. \n\nAs for rolls, the selection is smaller than other AYCE sushi places unfortunately. The only roll that really stood out to me was the Lemon roll which had yellowtail and salmon with sliced lemon on the top to combine the flavors. \n\nFor desserts, you can pick more than one! The mochi ice cream is pretty good. I also love the specials they have for desserts - I recently got mango mochi ice cream and yuzu ice cream which were both delicious! \n\nSushi Mon's AYCE price at $26.95 is great for the quality of nigiri sushi and fun diversity of daily specials but I still wish there were more selection for the appetizers and rolls!"

Dinner isn't much more than that.\n\nStarted things off with the sexy girl roll, the most expensive item on the menu. A pretty tasty shrimp tempura roll. It contained shrimp tempura, cucumber, scallop, spicy tuna. Blended with spicy garlic sauce and eel sauce.\n\nFor the nigiri, we had the yellow tail, salmon, and tuna rolls. My favorite was the salmon nigiri.\nWe followed things up with the cajun albacore. Loved the unique cajun seasoning on the albacore. Brings out a new flavor to sushi.\n\nOther Orders...\n\nVolcano roll came out nice and warm with quite interesting flavors. Overall, pretty okay.\nScallop yum yum roll with orgasm sauce was the best!\nPixie roll contained crab, shrimp, cucumber, avocado, smelt eggs, and eel sauce all wrapped in soy paper. An unusually large roll. Also an unfavorable ending to my stomach considering the amount of sushi we already had. \n\nFinished things off with a tempura ice cream. Unfortunately, it was a bit disappointing. The tempura was just too soft and soggy."

The trick is the rice that fills you up quick.  This place is excellent for your sushi cravinigs.  The wait between orders of sushi is a little long but it's worth it and understandable when the place is busy.  The sushi rolls aren't just rice with minimalist fill. It's appropriate to what you order.  All you can eat sushi is incomplete without edemame, wasabi, and soy sauce on the side.  You have to have miso soup to wrap it all up toward the end of your sushi session.  It's a nice cozy joint and the staff are friendly.  Recommend: Spicy Tuna roll, ahi poke, 911 roll, 007 roll, miso soup, teriyaki bowl, unagi, and screaming orgasm."

They have very fresh sushi and a huge selection to choose from! I love sitting at the Sushi Bar and interacting with their Sushi Chefs.  The best part is, when you get all you can eat, there is a huge menu of not only sushi but other dishes you can have along with desert.  I love the mochi balls.   My fav is the strawberry.  For $25 a person, you can't go wrong! Sake Bombs!! Sake Bombs!!  :)  If you don't feel like all you can eat, they do have a very reasonably priced sushi menu!! YUMMMMY!"

Wish it was closer to home and the location was larger because at peak times this place is packed! (Go during off peak times for less of a wait time.) On our most recent visit a couple days ago we both did the sushi meals and it was yummy. The fish pieces were huge! And delicious! I don't have anything bad to say about the food except for Yum. Mind you I am picky since I'm from Hawaii and miss having access to my sushi or poke. What I would say is don't be too excited about the ahi or tako poke. Those are just okay. Another high point is for gyoza or shumai you are able to get them steamed and not fried. A great option for a healthier audience. If you like spicy, the spicy tuna is spicy and the 911 roll is HOT! If you like super, super spicy don't get it! The regular spicy tuna is yum and perfectly hot. The salad that comes with the meals is under par. I've had better. But all in all it's a good eat and buy."

The waitress wanted us to order directly from the chef, there are 2 of them inside the bar but they were always so busy it's hard to order from them, there were only 2 of them, a lot of times we ordered 2 order on one item,but it only came out with one, and you can't order more than 3 items with different quantities 'cause he will mess up 100%, also you have to pretty much be yelling at the chef to make orders because he is so busy and far a way. The quick lunch took us 2 and half hours, about more than 2 hours of that time we had nothing to eat and nothing to do but staring at the busy chef........\nThe ratio of meat to rice is also not as good as the Sushi Mon on W Sahara, with more rice and less meat. \nThe only thing better about this location is the menu is larger , with a lot more selections and special rolls,,,Oh, the mochi is delicious, but you get the same thing elsewhere.\nMy friend asked the server several times for more ginger, but no, the server kept forgetting, so I just gave my ginger to my friend since I don't like it that much.....\nI say they need more cooks and servers if they are so busy ....."

The only way to keep customer coming back is having good food quality and providing excellent experiences for them.\nWe waited almost 10 mins to have anyone to noticed us and sit us. \nOnly time the server check on us is when he asked for our drinks. Asked for one iced tea and 1 water with lemons came out 2 water with lemons. Hey thats ok. People make mistake. \nWhat upsets me the most is that if we seated at the bar, the reason to sit there is to be served directly from the chef. \nWe sat there exactly for 10 mins. And no one even acknowledge if us were there. NO HI NO HELLO NO WELCOME but a glare from a mexican chef with his unhappy face. We get it youre busy. But it takes 30 secs to remind customers that you know they are there, and will be right there to help. I wouldnt mind waiting so much.  I wanted to walk out so bad but the bf told me not to since we ordered side dishes already.\n10 mins passed, still no help so i had to get the server attention if we could order and he took our orders. \nWas going to do all you can eat but we felt so uncomfortable with the place were being so loud, no one seems to want to come check on us or even help us. Also the mexican guy kept glaring and rolling his eyes at us. So we switched it to ala carte and hurried to leave. The Experience werent great at all."

I've waited and been happy with it, but it still sucks to wait over an hour for your delicious sushi. \n\nOn the plus side, this place has so many rolls and they do a great job mixing and matching the different fish options and the sauces. They also do specials that have proven to be pretty incredible (check out the posted specials on signs throughout the restaurant). It's pretty tiny in there and it does get a little cramped at your table with your 10,000 lbs of AYCE deliciousness. \n\nAs a HUGE bonus (wish I could give extra half stars!), dessert and appetizers are also AYCE so you can have as many mochi as your little heart desires. I once had a friend who came in and ordered ONLY mochi (no fish!) for the whole meal. No a lot of places can get away with that :) Also, they're open pretty late, so when the hunger strikes, you can get your sushi on. \n\nFavorite rolls include: Super white tuna (BEST EVER), Lasagna Roll, Crispy Rice Roll, J.J. Roll, Pastel, Rock n Roll, and the Moment Roll."

I usually dine with my pals after we do a long ride or run in the area, so we come ready to eat.  This was the case again this past Saturday when we arrived a few minutes before the doors opened at 11:45am.  There were a few other people waiting, too, but our party of six had no problem snagging a table, so come early and you won't have to wait, either.\nI can only eat shellfish, so my sushi choices are very limited, but I like the appetizers, too.  This equates to a not very healthy meal, but you gotta live a little.\nMy usuals:  miso soup, shrimp and vegetable tempura, shumai, cucumber salad, shrimp tempura roll, 007 roll, Dynamite roll, Moment roll, with red bean ice cream or strawberry mochi for dessert.\nThe service is always attentive and the food just keeps coming.  For the amount of food that we can put away when we're hungry, Sushi Mon is a bargain.  \n\n*Review #200 for 2013--yay."

I can safely say that the quality is much better than every other AYCE sushi bar that I've eaten at by a long shot, but that's not to imply that the other places were overwhelmingly difficult to beat.\n\nPros:\n- Price.

It comes with a sweet shrimp head in it.\n\nCons:\n- Inconveniently located away from the Las Vegas strip.\n- This place is always busy.

Great quality cuts for the sushi, which is pretty much the only thing I order here. The service is exceptional too.\n\nNever got the rolls so I can't review them, but going back to the sushi. The salmon cuts are very nice! They usually have 3-4 featured sushi, but it costs a little more, just charges you dinner prices which is about 3 bucks more. If it's available, it's kind of a no brainer for me. \n\nLove this place, highly recommend it, which I do to all my friends. There's dessert too, but it's up to you. I usually just eat more sushi instead, but the ice cream is great."

I've tried other AYCE places and they never compare to Sushi Mon. Great selection of fish and the absolute best part is they will make any roll they offer into a hand roll and they'll customize it for you.  I've been to other restaurants that look at you like you're crazy for even asking.  They never pressure you about the 1 hour time limit,  and the service is very good considering how busy they are.  My suggestion is don't bring small children that don't enjoy any form of Japanese food, the place is super busy to have to manage a baby and frustrating for fellow diners. (rant over) can't recommend this place enough and can't wait to go back."

High quality food, great service, and nice fair prices.\n\nIt's an AYCE all you can eat, Sushi restaurant that also has non-sushi items on the menu that counts towards AYCE, so you can have a variety of foods and flavors.\n\nIt's much better than buying sushi a la carte, by the order, if you can eat more than 10 pairs of sushi, then you're going to really get your money's worth here.\n\nI'd come here again.  If you're from the Los Angeles area, and know the place \"Midori\" in the Valley, this is similar to that in format and quality.  And inversely, if you like Sushi Mon in Vegas and are ever in the LA area, check out Midori.\n\nParking was easy, in the hot, outdoor lot shared with other retailers."

But I hate it when you pay good money and they provide you with crap.  I'm not talking about a $5.99 chinese buffet restaurant here.  It's pretty expensive.  So, based on my last visit and review of this place, why did I go back?  Because it was a cold rainy night in Vegas and this place was close by.  Believe me, I was looking on Yelp for another Japanese restaurant to try but couldn't find one w/ decent reviews.  The chicken cutlet was horrible.  It appeared to have been cooked once and then deep fried again just prior to serving.  The NY strip - menu describes it as \"...cooked to perfection\" -  actually it was \"overcooked to perfection\".  The thing was like cardboard.  Most of the dishes were pretty bad this visit, which I promise will be my last."

By 12:15 it was packed, although the lunch crowd had cleared out by 1pm.\n\nThe food was great! My favorite was the Exstacy roll. I also like that they put extra sauces right on the menu, and of course they are included in AYCE. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5, is that they did not have any sashimi on the menu. Some other AYCE places will limit you to one order of sashimi per person, but I appreciate having the option. But, their fish was very fresh so we did get a couple orders of plain sushi."

I came here for dinner with a group of friends, and we all decided to enjoy the sushi buffet for $26.95/person. \n\nWe ordered some rolls as soon as we sat down.  The rolls came out within 5 minutes, which is really fast.  Everything tasted fresh and really delicious.  I love how there isn't a lot of rice on the sushi, too.  Its great that we can order half rolls, so we got to try more items.\n\nMy favorites were the following:\n1. Grilled Yellowtail Collar - the fish was cooked to perfection.  The fish fell off the bone and it was juicy.  I really liked the dipping sauce which gave it more flavor.\n\n2. Seaweed salad - tasty\n\n3. Lychee Sherbet - I've never had this before, but it was really good.  The sherbet tasted like lychee, and it wasn't too sweet.\n\n4. Spider roll - The roll was pretty big, and the soft shell crab was good.\n\nOverall, service was great.  Even though it may be a bit pricey, its definitely worth it!

The broth of the soup is simply delicious, haven't had better udon soup anywhere else! Prices aren't too bad, they are like any sushi place, pretty much. Service was great our waitress was pretty funny and nice. Again, this definitely isn't a spot that you could just randomly drop into when you want because the wait is far too long!

Absolutely not. Are their rolls superior to other AYCE sushi restaurants? Nope!\n\nThis wildly popular sushi joint is gleaming with southern Las Vegas patrons. They are swarmed with clients day in and day out and late night. I walked in at 11pm on a Friday and there was a large crowd of people waiting to either get into the restaurant or just hanging out in front of Sushi Mon. I guess that is the new thing these days. \"Hey, we are going to hang out at Sushi Mon and pretend we are cool.\" Nevertheless, the wait was short as I was dining alone and the bar was sufficient for myself. \n\nI started to look at their laminated menu and took a look around the restaurant itself. The restaurant itself is bland, Someone had the bright idea of putting tile, in a diagonal pattern, on the wall. Are you kidding me? EPIC FAIL. The seating is quite spread out and the restaurant itself is quite small. The sushi chefs are abundant, however, and that is usually a great sign for a busy restaurant. The patrons seemed happy indulging in their gluttony of raw fish, rice, mayo and cream cheese creations. I for one, always order the sushi first before I order any specialty rolls. \n\nThe salmon sushi was just meh to my standards. Their salmon was a bit  warm and the texture seemed off. The tuna was good and their yellowtail was surprising very good. I do have to say their rolls are quite interesting. I can't really remember what I ordered, but what I did order tasted a-ok to me. I remember asking my sushi chef to make me their best roll they had. It was some shrimp tempura roll concoction wrapped in soy paper. Can't remember the name but I remember liking it very much. \n\nAs for the positive sides of the restaurant, I can see why people like this place. The warm welcoming staff, the sushi chefs, and the massive amount of people waiting to attack their sushi rolls with their salivating palates. \n\nA word for the owners. You are doing a great job. I hope you continue to succeed. For Christ's sake, please take that stupid tile down from the wall and put up some authentic artwork or something! Augh, it really makes me not want to dine there because of the crappy decor. Stop charging so much for standard sushi quality! Then again, if people are paying it why stop right? I understand.  \n\nYes I would return to the restaurant, but, I probably wouldn't go by myself again. If my friends are willing to go I may just join them."

Do get there early as there is usually a wait for this small hotspot, but the wait is usually quicker than the estimated time and always worth it.

I wasn't thrilled about the hurricane roll, but it was alright. Their fish is super fresh, the garlic tuna, super white, salmon, and Uni are my favorite! Fish to rice portion is perfect. Not too much rice, and the cut of the fish is not too thick. It's just like your average sushi bar, but you can count on their fish being fresh EVERYTIME. Service is friendly, chefs work at a fast pace. And you can do half rolls! You can't go wrong here!"

Between the 4 out of 5 star rating, and remembering that I had heard good th8ings about Sushi Mon, we decided to meet there for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. \n\nMost of the tables were full when we arrived so we decided to sit at the bar. After a quick glance at the menu it was clear that AYCE would be the best way for us to go so we started out with some edamame, miso soup for my friend and drinks while we decided on a few rolls. \n\nI love that they offer 1/2 rolls, it allows me to try things that look yummy but I am not sure about. I also love that ACYE included nigiri sushi, and the fish was nice and thick and tasted very fresh. We started with an order of tuna, salmon and yellowtail to start and ended up having seconds and then thirds of the tuna as it was just delicious. \n\nAs for rolls, we started with 1/2 orders of Caterpillar and Philadelphia rolls. These are my basics that I almost always order, and Sushi Mon did them well. We also had the Frying Jason roll which was a baked  roll that had scallops and yum yum sauce. A little heavy on the sauce but I would certainly order it again. We finished off with a Spider Roll because my friend wanted somethign with soft shell crab. This was made with soy paper and was large so I had a hard time eating it. This was my least favorite of the rolls we had...\n\nThe only problem I had was having to ask for water refill. Otherwise it was an extremely tasty lunch. They charge a little more for AYCE then some places but the quality of fish makes it worth it in my book... Sushi Mon is definitely on my go back ASAP list."

My friend and I were sat very quickly at the sushi bar where we were greeted by our sushi chef who's name I don't remember, but he had these light green eyes you can't miss. He was awesome. The real trouble began after he informed us he was going on break and had a different guy take over. My friend asks for another roll, as the chef begins to make this, the server drops off our checks, right in the middle of our meal. Now I wouldn't be so irritated by that if we were almost finished, but it felt as if we were being rushed to finish. Also my friend was supposed to pay for this meal, somehow they gave us each separate checks, one AYCE and one ale cart. We told them we were BOTH doing AYCE and that it would be ONE check. I was a little annoyed but figured hey must've forgotten or something might have happened, so I brushed it off. The final straw however, was when the checks were dropped off the chef stopped making our rolls and looked at the bills. He then asked us why the checks had been dropped off, and if we were done. When we told him we weren't finished eating and to continue making the roll, he still continued to question us as to if we were finished, asking if we were gonna pay for the rolls he was making, saying \"I don't know what's going on.\" Only after we flagged down a server to change both bills to AYCE, did he continue to make our rolls. The first sushi chef we had was amazing, I'm really sad he had to go on break before we finished our meal. I'm sure this review would've been much better if the second chef hadn't been so rude. I won't be back, but for everyone else who goes and sits at the sushi bar, look for the Hispanic man with the green eyes, like I said he's AWESOME."

But I can say their AYCE has always been solid and consistent which is why it seems to be always busy and which is why your service may take a hit. Be prepared to wait to be seated in the small restaurant during peak hours and to occasionally wait for your server or sushi chef during your meal because they are tied up.\n\nThey have extended hours for the late night cravings. For the novice sushi eaters, there are plenty of pictures on the menu to aid you. If you're sitting at the bar, the chefs are more than willing to answer any questions or fill any requests. Keep your eye on the chalkboard for any specials also.\n\nThis last visit I sat at the sushi bar just after opening on a Saturday and had a solid meal of appetizers and nigiri. The chef was busy but made sure my meal was flowing smoothly. I didn't get any rolls as all of the 30 pieces of nigiri were delicious and enough to satisfy me. They had two clam specials: Asari rayu and orange clam (I took pictures of both but they were pretty crappy so I didn't post them) which both had oil and sauce respectively that elevated the clam which is something I normally don't order.\n\nSushi Mon is not head and shoulders above the rest and they're location is not convenient for me. I am still a fan though and will continue to frequent there but it will most likely be only late night, or if I happen to be driving in the area and the wait looks reasonable."

If I'm not scoping out a new place, this is my old-reliable sushi place.\n\nSushi Mon is a small privately owned sushi restaurant in a rather nondescript shopping center on the corner of Maryland and Silverado.  It's also very popular, so be prepared to wait for up to half an hour or even 45 minutes on busy nights.\n\nThat being said, it's totally worth even an hour wait to get in.  The sushi chefs are fun and talkative, and really help you out, and will make you custom rolls if you ask for it.  The fish is always fresh and flavorful, and they have a lot of specialty rolls, and are always adding more.  In addition, they have a large selection of nigiri, and will always have a special of the day posted on the wall.  The wait stuff is quick and efficient, though they don't have as much personality as the chefs.  And the manager is the best guy ever.  \n\nPersonal favorites are the jala-jala roll, the sushi-bon, Pete's roll, and the must-have Dynamite.  \n\nThe all-you-can-eat is $26.95, which is a little daunting for newbies, but it's the only choice for a Sushi Mon-ster like me.  Keep in mind, too, that you can get half-rolls as well, so you're not stuck eating a huge roll that you wanted to try but didn't like.  This is a social experience, so don't go alone, it's just not fun, is it?  \n\nAlso, they have an all-you-can-eat punch card.  Eat 10 times, and you get your 11th one free.  I've made use of this 3 times in the last year.  Here's a secret:  Take friends from out of town!  You can have their stamps and add to your card! :D  \n\nFinally, this place is just plain consistent.  I've been to other sushi places where they were good one day, and not good the next.  The service would be worse, or the fish would be less fresh, or some thing.  Sushi Mon has always been good and delicious and has never let me down yet, and I've been here more often than those other places combined.  \n\nDon't look for fine dining, just fun, over-stuffed sushi dining!"

I love ahi poki, just not their version of it.  Otherwise....\n\nNothin to complain about :-)"

The notable rolls: Lemon Roll, Chubby, Hurricane, & Sexy Girl. I was starved from the long ass wait that I did not take a single food pic. I also liked the octopus seaweed salad.

Although it was packed, we didn't have a wait because there was only two of us and we sat at the sushi bar.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\n--the Maryland location is small-ish, so you're in close quarters with everyone.\n\n-- it had a bit of a fishy smell, more so than other sushi joints. I chalked it up to the close quarters of place.\n\n--they were flexible with the AYCE option. At first, we weren't sure whether we wanted to do AYCE. Sometimes it makes more sense, especially if you want to try lots of different rolls.  But you gotta be ready for AYCE, i.e., have some drawstring sweatpants on.\n\nAs we debated, the chef advised us that he would tally the amount once we were done, and charge us whatever was less, whether that be itemizing the rolls or the AYCE price. Awesome!!!\n\n--one of the best things I loved is that they let you order half orders of most rolls. This is really great when there's only two people eating. My husband and I have different tastes, so it can be challenging to eat multiple rolls by myself. But we love trying lots of different rolls. Ordering half rolls was a great option for us.\n\n--that being said, I didn't l-o-v-e the rolls. Don't get me wrong -- it was good but I just didn't think it was *great.* Some of the rolls we had were kinda bland. Maybe it was just an off-night we went. I think I'm willing to give it a try again ;-)"

They offered great customer service the servers made sure my drink were always filled and they always checked to see if we needed something from the actual kitchen, because on the all you can eat menu they didn't have just sushi. You could order teriyaki chicken bowls, rice, poki, and other stuff. The Takoyaki (fried Octopus Ball) was really good not the best but it was pretty good! One of my favorite roll would have been the Dragon roll (California roll with eel on top and eel sauce) it was amazing. I would go back again.

I have been to almost all of the ayce sushi place in orange county and only a handful of ayce sushi places in LA, but I have never seen a worse rice to rise ratio for both the nigri pieces and the rolls. Actually some of the rolls were ridiculous large, especially the 5 piece rolls. The biggest rolls I have ever seen. When the menu states that you will be charge for extra rice, and then the rolls comes out a gigantic and filled with rice. Should have taken a picture of this. \n\n-Service. Our server was new, but overall very nice and did the best he can. We asked him if we can get a spider hand roll and he wasn't sure. My biggest gripe is that we have a kid. Most AYCE places have a different price for kids. He failed to mention this. A kid that is 8 years old should not be charge the same price as an adult, if everybody is charged the same price the restaurant should let customers know. \n\n-From the rice to fish ratio, to not disclosing the price difference, can't help but feel a bit of disingenuous on part of the owner. At the very least it is a lack of disclosing information that could easily enhanced a customer's experience. \n\nPros: The freshness and quality of the fish is above average in comparison to most of the ayce places I have been to. Too bad you only get to get a thin slice/small piece of it. If it wasn't for the quality of the fish, this place would really get one star."

The staff doesn't change and neither does the quality.  Don't expect fancy over the top rolls to delight your Instagram followers.  Do expect lots of sashimi choices.  Get a punch card, you will be back.  Consistency is where it's at here.  Also, lunch is cheaper with mostly all the same items.  Order the Cajun albacore and the baked mussels... you will be glad you did.  Lastly, if it's your first time, order half rolls so you can try everything.  Happy sushi eating."

The old owners took a lot of pride in treating the customers well and serving high quality sushi. since it was sold, the d\u00e9cor might be improved but the customer service and food quality stinks! They scrimp on the servings and the service. Also,I went there on a Tuesday night, after the main dinner crowd had left.  Only 2 tables were filled with customers and they refused to seat me at any table but a tiny one facing into a corner.  I am glad there are a lot of Sushi Restaurant choices on the west side, I've taken my business elsewhere."

I have to admit, I was annoyed when they charged my son who eats two pieces of a roll and plays with a third piece. I'm not cheap and I don't mind paying for him, but we were good for at least once a week. . . Let it slide. \n\nThen flavors from the kitchen changed too. Take it or leave it. I bought my restaurant as an existing business as well. Your customers liked what they received. You may think you're improving something, but in reality you are changing something that people like.

(He's tried the one on Maryland and loved it; we go to Goyemon -my favorite, on Decatur all the time).\n\nSat around for ten minutes at the bar before we ordered some rolls (AYCE of course). The rolls took a while to be made (very slow in comparison to all other AYCE sushi restaurants) especially considering how many customers were dining. It was just us, another couple, and one other lady. Luckily I eat pretty slow so I wasn't kept waiting too long between rolls. My boyfriend, however, really had to slow down his pace and did have to wait for new rolls. Btw, there were four sushi chefs working behind the bar. You definitely need to order as much as you can when you figure out what you want or else you will be waiting a while for your food to come. \n\nThe server didn't come and take the drink order until after our food already came. Again, keep in mind that they made the rolls relatively slow (and we only made two nigiri and two half roll orders). So we were already eating by the time she brought our two waters. \n\nSkip to the end of the meal...after we order dessert we notice a baby roach crawling on the menu right in front of us on the bar. We didn't make a big deal (as gross as it was); my boyfriend just squished its guts out with his napkin. But to make matters worse, when we were brought our bill, they charged us for dinner instead of lunch. We brought it to their attention that we were already seated by 3:50 (dinner doesn't start until 4:00 and we weren't going to pay an extra $10 when we didn't even order any dinner specials -namely the green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e  which I love). The server then came back and informed us that their computer said that we came in at 4:10 and that's when I called bull. I specifically remembered looking at the clock when we got our waters and it was 4:07. Again, we waited forever for our drinks, and if we got the drinks at 4:07 then how the hell did we walk in and get seated at 4:10? They finally decided to CORRECT the bill from dinner to lunch, but our whole experience was already ruined at that point. Will definitely not be making a return to this restaurant."

The establishment had been expanded and added a sushi island and the all your can eat price is cut in half. However, if the food quality and selection went down by half, I don't know why I would take that extra time to go away from the Strip just to visit this place.\n\nThis had been my all time favorite in the past and this time, it let me down big time.

            "review": "Update: had a pretty awesome AYCE meal here last weekend. Sat in front of the friendly Kazu-san and had a good time. Incredibly tender unagi. Nice salmon belly and yellowtail belly. Very buttery toro. Sushi rice in the nigiri was on the warm side, and loosely packed - and I appreciated that. All of the nigiri was prepared like this. Kazu-san's got skills!\n\nI was also served a perfectly broiled Yellowtail Collar - medium rare. Delicious. The scallop sushi was very firm and fresh - the closest to live I've had in nigiri form. (Sushi Koma's scallop sushi is rather slimy+fishy in comparison.)\n\nMy new hand roll rule: Only order hand rolls one-at-a-time at the sushi bar *only* (to maintain a crispy nori cone). Makes all the difference. Your hand roll nori will become a soggy latex funnel if you let it sit for more than 20 seconds. Gobble it up as soon as it is made!\n\nI am again a big fan of the 'new' Sushi Mon. Great service, little or no wait time, and a convenient location for West-siders. I *do* enjoy the kitchen food at Sushi Koma a little more (e.g. their Tostada, their gyoza) but as far as straight-up sushi goes, Sushi Mon is fantastic."

It was worth every penny to pay 5 dollars more. \n\nThe service was great. Easy to call service all the time. Also recommend sitting at sushi bar. It is easier to order when you sit in front of the chef.  The sushi chef remembered me from yesterday and started to make sushi for me after asking me if I want similar sushi/ portions from yesterday. The dessert green tea ice cream was kind of lacking, but the tempura ice cream was very good. \n\nOverall I would recommend anyone to eat here.

About 1.5 yrs ago, they changed the unagi to a lesser quality and smaller portion. It's been downhill since then. At Sushi Mon recently, we had to send back the snow crab because it was starting to spoil and was inedible. They are serving salmon nigiri that includes sinews from the worst parts of the fish. Gone is the beautiful marbling of fat that should be seen with good quality salmon nigiri. The California role? Though this role blasphemes the very idea of traditional sushi, the one they served us should be a source of major embarrassment to any sushi chef. The uni thankfully was fresh and delicious. I know the quality of AYCE sushi can never match a la carte, but in this case, the AYCE sushi used to be much better. The price hasn't gone down, but now the quality has dipped so far that we've decided to start searching for a new favorite sushi spot, sorry to say."

My friends have gone to the Sushi Mon over on Maryland before, and one of them got pretty ill, but she gets sick pretty easily so I didn't necessarily think it was cause to boycott all Sushi Mon locations in the state. How wrong I was. \n\nI was here the other night on a date (his choice), and I was immediately underwhelmed by the super small interior, fishy smell, and the fact that they said the wait was 20 min but ended up being 35. We finally got seated at the bar and opted for the AYCE, which I normally never do, but seemed like a good idea so I could order some uni and salmon belly. I was slightly skeptical about the quality of the fish, but I've eaten a lot of gross things in my day and figured it couldn't be thaaat bad. \n\nWell, a few pieces of sushi into the meal, a beetle comes crawling across my plate. That's right, a BEETLE. I sprang into action and crushed that sucker with my napkin, as it became incredibly clear that my date was paralyzed by bugs. Too stunned and disgusted to fully comprehend what just happened, I was in the process of looking around for a server to tell them what I saw when ANOTHER BEETLE came crawling up from under the sushi bar and onto my plate. At this point I jumped up from my seat and my date's face was white, (I was grossed out but also found this whole scenario incredibly funny, and I felt really bad for him), and as small as the place was, no other diners really seemed aware that they were eating next to bugs, and what's more alarming is that the employees barely cared!! A busser came over to take my napkins with the bugs in them that I had already killed, mumbled out an apology, and went on his way. We had to then ask for the bill so we could get out of there, but that was it, no other apology, no comping of anything, we barely ate more than 4 pieces of nigiri and they still charged us for 2 AYCE meals. Absurd. \n\nBugs on Sahara, recorded illnesses on Maryland, horrible service at both. Health Inspector...where are you!?"

The servers are Japanese but the four sushi chefs are mixed, could be Japanese and Chinese but I saw one was teaching the other, one was focusing on filleting, one was on a cell phone (kidding!). Of course no one's on a cell phone here, hello! Anyway, the lunch was great and we would come back here, for sure.

            "review": "My family of 4 live nearby and have tried this place about 4 times. Although the food is good (thanks to the sushi chefs) and reasonable, the service or lack thereof is poor to say it politely. They are simply unfriendly and border on rude at times and they act like they do not care whatsoever whether you come back or not. They do not show any appreciation for our patronage either, which is irritating to say the least when you spend your hard earned money. So much so it makes the whole experience unenjoyable.  It's too bad because we enjoy the food and love sushi and since we live nearby, we want one of those places that we can go to often and you know them and they know and its always a pleasant meal and experience. However, after eating here 4 times and hoping the service will be better each time, it just isn't and we walk out saying well at least the food was good. We really want this to be our place but I guess we'll have to give our hard earned money to another establishment that appreciates it. Very disappointing. If I could give 0 stars I would. Again, this review is not a reflection on the sushi chefs at all, the food is good, its the service and management that has driven us not to return."

            "review": "Sushi to rice ratio is way off. 2x the rice to thin slice of fish. Don't order appetizers  (miso soup / seaweed salad) they put extra salt to get you to drink more and eat less. They get mad if you don't finish every grain of their rice. \"That's a 'no no'. You must eat all rice or they charge you\" says the waitress. Who is \"they\"? Lol \n\nQuality of cuts is not good as the sushi \"chef\" leaves the tough \"silver skin\" in the fish, making it disappetizing. Add the excessive rice clump to the mix and you get expensive gas station quality sushi.\n\n1 star for the can of Febreeze in the bathroom.  Thank you ;)\n\nTip: You can easily dump their excess sushi by putting all of it into a napkin and flushing it into their toilet! Or load your mouth and spit it into the toilet, if you don't want to keep asking for napkins!)\n\nHealth: Kitchen has a moldy stink to it. You may want to give it a wiff while waiting for your table. You may change you dining plans afterwards. I didn't notice it until I went to dump my rice load. \n\nGo to Kazuki Sushi on Decatur. WAY BETTER AYCE!"

Some of the more specialty nigiri (garlic tuna, seared salmon) is also topped with a ponzu sauce that makes everything fall apart and way too salty. Spider roll was also very salty. Shrimp tempura was good. Service was not bad when I was there. For a good off the strip AYCE sushi option I suggest JJANGA, which has better sushi and is a dollar cheaper."

They have a sign as soon as you walk in that if all your party is not present, that seat will be given to next customers.. So was not the case today.. As they left 2 open seats empty for 15 minutes to wait for another person to join a party at sushi bar as other people were waiting for seats. When I asked employee for a manager, she paused for a few seconds and said that they were not available!! One star because I really liked the variety; but we ended finding something better and less expensive without all the \"rules\" and \"time limit\"!!"

Had no issues parking and came at 1pm just a few hours after opening. \n\nAfter the disappointment at 808 tapas I've been craving some good sushi, especially an AYCE spot. In comes Sushi Mon, their AYCE is $21.95 and they give you 45 minutes to eat. 45 minutes may not seem like a lot but at the speed they make them in and how much you can order its more than enough time. \n\nI ordered some nigiri, salmon, squid, and cajun albacore along with 007 roll, JJ roll, pastel, and alaskan roll. It was all very delicious, service was super fast and very efficient. I was completely stuffed when I walked out and more than satisfied. \n\nWhats great about this place is if you really want to try something but don't want the 8 pieces, they let you get a half order's with 4 pieces, so you can really try a diverse selection rather than get stuffed on a few items. Remember anything you don't finish they charge you for so make sure your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach.\n\nGet their frequent dining card, after the 10th AYCE you get one free, whats great is if your with someone and they get the AYCE it counts as two on your card so if you go with people that don't go often get credit for their meal. All in all I enjoyed my lunch, at dinner its 3 dollars more for their AYCE and they give you 15 more minutes for a total of 1 hour."

I normally tackle the all-you-can-eat menu, which allows me to try everything in small portions (great when trying new items, or just enough before you call it quits!). The nigiri is great, as well as their house specialty rolls, which I suggest ordering later so you don't cork up your appetite so soon. Don't forget to save room for dessert(s) which is also included in AYCE- the tempura ice cream and lychee sorbet are my favorites!  For smaller appetites, the \"screaming orgasm,\" curry and udon are delicious \"regular menu\" options.  The staff is always friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is casual and fun. Being such a popular restaurant, you and your party may not be seated right away, but it's definitely worth the wait!"

The fish were as fresh as you could hope for here in vegas -- comparable to goyemon (another favorite sushi place). Their rolls were good though none stands out -- but they will make you custom rolls which is great! Aside from our usual nigiris: super white tuna, yellow tail, salmon, eel, red snapper; we always order: frying jason, volcano, dragon roll, mussels, orgasmic salad and whatever else is on the daily special board. They have a more extensive (with grilled fish) dinner menu so its also worth going there for dinner but 808 sushi offers more grilled fish than sushi mon so thats where we go if we feel like having sushi/grilled fish for dinner.\n\nSushi Mon's service was great and friendly. We get our orders without noticing how long it has been... And we order a lot to get our money's worth! The flow of food coming our way was exceptional and they always refill our teas. The place is small enough that wait staff always see you if you're trying to get their attention. \n\nOne thing i will always come back here for is their lychee sherbet!!! There's not a lot of restaurants here that serve lychee sherbet... its always worth the drive to have a little of this treat!"

I put my trust in you....wait, got sidetracked for a second....\n\nHow's the food???  THAT'S what matters to me!!\n\nWell, as you might have guessed seeing the 5 star review, it's better than good in my book.  It was surprisingly good actually!\n\nI ordered about 15 different kinds of Nigiri.  Not ONE of them were disappointing!  All tasted fresh, but here are some noteworthy ones to touch on :\n\nUni : Very good Uni! Love the consistency...not watery/runny or overly salty!  I am SUPER particular when it comes to uni...it's the difference between thoroughly enjoying it, or slightly gagging on it at first taste.  Thankfully, it's the former.\n\nHotate : The Fresh Scallops were PERFECT! Super tender, melt in your mouth good! Buttery, with just a hint of citrus and wasabi of course...only thing I have found to rival it ANYWHERE is YG&S's LIVE counterpart!  And considering that it's not FAIR to compare it, this is the best I've found LOL :P\n\nAmaebi : The sweet shrimp had a slight crunch to it, buttery taste, and smooth finish.  Great choice.  I did not receive the fried heads...you probably need to specify if you want them.\n\nThe Hamachi Kama was on the daily special...this is my most favorite part of the fish!  If you see it on the menu and don't mind diggin in for the good stuff, you gotta try the collar if you have been sleeping under a rock!  If you've had it before, you are gonna order it without reading this anyways LOL.\n\nAnd for dessert, both the Chocolate Mousse and Green Tea Creme Brulee were on daily special.  If you see either on the menu, I would highly recommend both!  Chocolate mousse is a little thicker than their sister stores counterpart, but still that same great taste.  The creme brulee was perfect...strong green tea taste, and I love that crispy crust!\n\nService was very fast.  They were pretty slow on this Tuesday night, which got me worried about the quality I was to encounter, but I am glad it didn't affect my visit.  But because it was slow, my orders got taken promptly, food was prepared and served quickly, and I always had refills etc.\n\nOnly NEGATIVE thing I can think of...I got charged $3 for \"sharing\" with Little Foodie Dude.  He just turned two, and yes, he DOES have an appetite LOL, but it will mark forever in history as his first charge at an AYCE restaurant.  I'm not too mad though, considering he ate an entire order of Edamame, 4 pieces of unagi, ahi, salmon skin handroll etc lol.  He got his $3 worth :P\n\nI hope it wasn't a fluke, but I much preferred my visit today than the last few times I have been to the Henderson location, as well as the G'monster himself!  All they need now is the Grilled Pork Belly and I'll never have to go back there again lol.\n\nKeep it up Sushi-Mon...keep the ball rollin forward and never look back!\n\nPics :"

Both locations are one of the best AYCE Sushi joints in Vegas. Lunch AYCE is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95. You don't have to get AYCE and can just order like a normal restaurant. But I think the prices for the All you can eat is quite a good deal if you know what to order.

Each order is 2 pieces of Nigiri.) My favorites being: 1. Salmon ( A very fresh and clean tasting fish. I highly recommend this to first time sushi eaters as it doesn't have any fishy smell and is very smooth. My all time favorite.)\n2. Yellowtail ( Classified as a \"Luxury fish\" Has a rich oily texture. The flesh is light red, A good piece of Yellowtail has very rich flavors. I used to go deep sea fishing for this with my late father. ) \n3. Halibut ( White meat of the sea, Hirame has a very light taste and is delicate. The meat has a soft and chewy texture and lots of flavor. Another fish I used to go deep sea fishing for. Quite an ugly fish if you ever catch one yourself. But one of my favorites by far.\n4. Unagi (Grilled Fresh water Eel. Has a rich flavor and should be both crisp and tender. I recommend this fish at the end of the meal as the flavor is strong and may overwhelm your taste buds. You want to start off with the lighter tasting fish to fully enjoy the taste of Sushi.)\n\nTuna (Maguro)   $3.85\nGarlic Tuna   $4.20\nSeared Tuna   $4.20\nSuper White Tuna   $4.50\nYellowtail (Hamachi)   $3.90\nSalmon (Sake)   $3.85\nSeared Salmon   $4.20\nAlbacore (Bincho)   $4.20\nCajun Albacore   $4.50\nHalibut (Hirame)   $4.00\nRed Snapper (Tai)   $3.80\nMackerel (Saba)   $3.80\nFresh Scallop (hotate)   $4.75\nYum Yum Scallop   $3.50\nShrimp (Ebi)   $4.00\nSquid (Ika)   $3.75\nOctopus (Tako)   $3.80\nSurf Clam (Hokki)   $3.80\nCrab Stick   $3.50\nCrab Meat   $3.50\nSnow Crab Meat   $4.95\nFresh Water Eel (Unagi)   $4.50\nSmelt Egg (Masago)   $3.50\nSalmon Roe (Ikura)   $4.20\nSweet Egg (Tamago)   $3.00\nSweet Shrimp (Amaebi)   $5.50\nSea Urchin (Uni)   $7.00"

I was out to dinner with 2 friends & after reading the reviews this place relieved, it sounded fantastic. After the first round of orders the quality of the service & sushi went down drastically. The server let us sit for 15min after taking our plates from the first order before returning to take our follow up orders. When the 2nd order had been placed, our server returned 10min later & rudely questioned if we could even finish our order. This led to another 10min wait before receiving our food. I understand having to serve & accommodate other orders/customers, but the delivery of our food was a slow & drawn out process, especially when compared to the super quick food drops when we first sat down. Sushi that was supposed to be hot was cold, & the cold sushi was warm as if it had been sitting out. At this point we knew we were no longer wanted. After flagging down our server, we requested dessert along with the bill. The mochi was on point, but the tempura ice cream was presented in a soggy condition, ending our evening at this establishment. All of this & they had the nerve to ask for a 12% percent gratuity on the check. They treated us horribly as customers. We were not loud in anyway,  rude or disrespectful in any manner, or deserving of this horrendous customer service. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone.

I was being lazy one night and didn't want to dine in, so I got my food to go. Staff was friendly and my order came out quickly. I ordered three rolls:\n\nSushi Mon Lasagna\nPastel \nDomingo\n\nOne thing to note is that the sauces come on the side with to go orders. This is good because it gives me a chance to try the rolls naked. I loved the Domingo roll. It has tuna and avocado with jalape\u00f1o salsa on top and ponzu sauce. This roll was super tasty as is, but the addition of ponzu sauce upped the ante for me. I wouldn't hesitate to order this again.\n\nThe lasagna was a second favorite. This roll is very decadent. Cream cheese and scallops baked on top of a California roll and smothered in eel sauce. Soooo good and probably a billion calories a piece, but so worth it. I was hesitant the first time I ever tried a lasagna roll. Who knew cream cheese would be so good with fish? Not me. But it is amazing. This is a very rich roll so maybe try half if you have never had it before. \n\nThe pastel was good as well but was my least favorite. It had shrimp and crab wrapped in soy paper, and shrimp and avocado on top. I omitted the cream cheese from this roll but it does come with it. After that lasagna roll I couldn't think about eating more cream cheese. Eel sauce and spicy mayo top this, but I felt like the sauces didn't add much to a pretty plain roll. \n\nWhile I sat and waited for my order I was offered water which I declined but thought was nice. Everyone I came across was nice and they even thanked me for waiting. I will be back for the AYCE- Lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95."

            "review": "Sushi Mon is the sister restaurant to Goyemon, which is one of my favorites, so Sushi Mon is definitely a 5-star in my books as well!\n\nSushi Mon is on the West side of town, and my family and I love this place. We used to go about once a month to this location when we weren't going to Goyemon across town. We would go for either lunch ($21.95/person) or dinner ($26.95/dinner). Since the menus are essentially the same between the two, I want to call out a lot of the same reasons why we love Sushi Mon. \n\nFirstly, there are some advantages to going for dinner - 1) they serve salmon belly nigiri, which is way better than getting regular salmon nigiri and 2) you can get 1 order of uni (sea urchin) and 1 order of amaebi (sweet shrimp). Other than these two things, you can pretty much order everything else, including the AYCE dessert, during lunch. The major differences between Sushi Mon and Goyemon is that Goyemon has grilled fish items for dinner, as well as ramen after 11pm, so if you want those items, check out Goyemon instead.\n\nAnyway, our typical order when we go for dinner at Sushi Mon includes the following items: \n1) nigiri - salmon belly, hamachi (yellowtail), saba (mackerel), super white tuna, uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp), snow crab meat, unagi (fresh water eel), and ikura (salmon roe)\n2) rolls - Sexy Girl, Hurricane, Sushi Mon Style Lasagna\n3) side dishes - steamed gyoza, yakitori, shrimp and vegetable tempura, sashimi salad, miso soup, baked green mussels, udon\n4) dessert - lychee sorbet, green ice cream, strawberry mochi, green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e\n\nJust like Goyemon - this is one of the easiest 5-star ratings I can give on Yelp. The only complaint I have about Sushi Mon is that the wait can be long as well, although we've noticed that the wait isn't as long as Goyemon. The restaurant is not all that big, and if you have a group bigger than 4, it can take about an hour to get seated. \n\nIf you ever go to Las Vegas (and you are still reading this review), promise me you'll go to Sushi Mon or its sister restaurant, Goyemon. Ok? Cool, thanks!"

We were pressed for time so we just wanted something quick, easy and that would fill us up. \n\nWe tried 3 different rolls: \n\nSpider roll - (5pcs) Deep fried soft shell crab, crab meat, cucumber and avocado wrapped in soy paper with eel sauce $9.95- The soy paper was green so it looked interesting. The fried crab flavor was faint and almost tasted like shrimp tempura. I wouldn't say it's the best roll I've ever ate, it was basic and not memorable.\n\nVolcano roll - (8pcs) California roll with yum yum sauce & scallop  $8.95 - it was smothered in yum yum mayo/eel sauce. I'm not complaining since I love that decadent stuff. \n\nCaterpillar roll - (8pcs) Eel and cucumber wrapped with sliced avocado & eel sauce $9.95 - one of the classics! It was good, the eel was fatty and I enjoyed it. But $10 is pretty pricy in my opinion. \n\nI think that they are overpriced for their presentation and what was offered to us. But businesses have to make their money somehow!"

Second, when something like this happens, I would have thought the manager would have come over to make sure my son was ok... Nope all we got was a sorry from the waiter and then he started to clean the water up. So I went back to the restrooms which were both taken at the time, waited there for a minute and just decided to take my son out to the car to change him and calm him down... Once again waiting for the manager to come up to us. So by the time I got to the car I was just livid. All I wanted to do was leave. I knew if I had stayed I would have ripped someone a new one. \n\nOn the way home I called the manager and spoke to him. He was no help what so ever and was claiming that the reason he didn't walk up to us was because \"we were in the bathroom\"... Which we weren't... And \"we walked outside\"... Which he still could have came to check on us and make sure my sone was ok. Excuses excuses!

I  have him do an omakase-style meal of nigiri and the daily specials (which are all reliably great!), and eat until I can't anymore.\nSoto is good at pacing so you can enjoy quite a few pieces of fish before unbuttoning your pants or admitting defeat, and is quite charming to make conversation with as you munch.\n\nStellar stand-outs: fresh scallop, garlic tuna, cajun albacore, tuna hand roll, ika with mint (totally crazy!), and the sea bass. Sides of mussels, miso, orgasm salad and/or sashimi salad are also good add-ons. \n\nI'm not too big on rolls here unless I'm ordering to-go, but the Lemon roll, Crispy Spicy Roll, and Moon roll are all good picks- they have quite an extensive menu organized by specials, fried rolls, and tempura rolls and most have pictures to accompany them.\n\nFor dessert, I tend to stick to the classic green tea ice cream which is never gritty or chalky, while my BF swears by their tempura ice cream (today's special flavor was chocolate-fudge), but they also have a green tea creme brulee on the dinner menu that I've been meaning to try.\n\nAll the staff here are incredibly friendly and genuine, but Chef Soto is my favorite. Even if he's not working, all the guys are willing to feed you the best quality and best tasting fish in town, served with a smile and a joke or two.\n\nEDIT: dropping my rating. Chef Soto and several other familiar faces behind the bar are gone, and with them the top-notch service and quality I've loved about this place."

I always get the seaweed salad as a starter because of how fresh it tastes, and then basically any bit of sushi, nigiri, and side that they offer on the AYCE menu. I then finish off with one of their desserts such as the mochi ice cream, green tea ice cream, or litchi ice cream. Sometimes they are out of the strawberry mochi (which is my favorite) but I'm fine with getting their other flavors when that happens. While this place is kind of small, it is around the corner from my house so it is the one we always go to. I don't feel like the wait time for food is that bad; if you order several sushi dishes at once they bring the next out just as you finish off the last dish. Go as a group and all get the AYCE so you can share. Lastly, if you order an nigiri, don't forget to request their fresh wasabi to go with it!"

My experience today was far from those low reviews, if anything I'd say that the quality and service was probably one of the best I've had from any sushi place in a long time!!! My boyfriend and I did AYCE as usual, and at $27 we thought it was pretty pricy, but stayed anyway since it had been a year since we'd last been here. We love to order nigiri, so I'll try to remember everything: \n\n-tuna\n-garlic tuna \n-tako\n-salmon \n-blue fin toro \n-euro sea bass \n-poki\n-ebi \n-yellowfin \n- 1/2 911 roll\n- 1/2 a chi chi \n- 1/2 sexy girl \n- 1/2 crispy rice \n\nI can't go into detail describing every dish since it's all pretty self explanatory and the last 4 specialty rolls I forget what was in them :(  I will tell you this though, the quality of the fish was superb, especially the salmon belly and toro (it melted in your mouth!) but the best part was the quantity of fish!!! Some places they give you a huge chunk of rice with a thin later of fish... Not here, not this time! Thick ass pieces!! Excuse my language, I'm just that excited!!! And our chef, BEN, was super nice, explained every kind of fish, their delivery dates, and even made us some nice nigiri pieces that were not on the menu. This totally made the price well worth it, and the staff weren't awkward when we ordered half their inventory, like we usually do when we order sushi.  We also arrived right after the lunch menu, 4pm, so it was not crowded and noisy, and had all their attention!! \n\nGreat place, friendly staff, superb service, and superior quality and quantity of fish. Shout out to Ben once again for the service!!! \nThank god I wore my stretchy pants today!!!"

My favorites are their takoyaki, baked green mussels, garlic tuna, super white tuna, red snapper, the Moon Roll, and the Ecstasy Roll.\nA couple of small things I wish they could improve on are outside seating and a tiny bit more effort on sweeping. With the outside seating, it gets pretty busy some nights, and you can not sit unless your entire party is present. With the sweeping, the restaurant is pretty much always clean, but my boyfriend dropped a piece from his roll today and there was rice everywhere under his seat. We got the attention of one the staff and told them what happened, and if I was a host or server there, my first instinct would be to sweep it up right away."
