But I doubt I'll return to this place."

The our last view was a real treat!\nI had been craving a chimi for years and the sweet server said he would go back and ask if they could do a vegan one....of course they could! I ordered a bean and cheeze and avocado chimi :D I wish I took a pic of it it was soooo yummy and gooey and ridiculous :D I asked for black beans with mango salsa on top as my side. \n\nAnyway, this place will make you just about anything you want. I even requested the kale salad be put into a wrap before and yep they did it.\n\nService is slow sometimes but always pleasant. The owner is a sweetheart, glad he left what he was doing to open his Nacho Daddy's ;) \n\nWe had a Yelp event at the one at Henderson and after that we tried Hendo location again after that....ummmm we are not a fan. \n\nWe have had some yummy veggie fajitas here also (don't know if they are a menu item). You can't beat their nachos. I wish they had a cauliflower buffalo vegan nacho like I have made at home then I would truly be in heaven. My fav item is still the kale salad. It's that dressing, that grilled corn, delicious. \n\n\nThat spicy tofu burrito is out of this world but wow it's freaking spicy I don't know how my bro in law nor my hubby eats that. They always inhale theirs.\n\nI'm not a fan of adult drinks and hubby is allergic to tequila (in an oopma loompa turning orange type of way) so not really sure about their margs etc but my friend said her special tooty fruity marg was super yum and super strong. \n\nNacho Daddy IS the Nacho Daddy."

My husband and I visit Vegas often and going forward the service that we received will bring us back to Nacho Daddy's every time. Make this a place to stop on your list of things to do in Vegas!

They were battered and crispy.\n\nFriendly and interesting banter with the bartender. Wasn't too busy. It was before dinner. This was a linner meal. Late afternoon. The staff seemed to laugh and gab about enjoying themselves. \n\nService was quick. It was a pleasure to dine there. The air conditioner worked. Good conversation. Good tunes. I have zero complaints. I was contented. I would like to explore the menu more. \n\nWhilst in Vegas, hop over to Nacho Daddy. You'll be glad you did."

It was late, we were hungry. The place was pretty empty. The food was loaded with msg and made me sick for days. I had the so called homemade guac.....wasn't the freshest. I ordered the wild rice which seems to have come from a box and loaded with msg. Had the server to remove it from the check as I did not eat it after examining it. The black beans were good. Again, it seems msg is what gives this food any kind of flavor. My companion had the queso served with chips and a heat lamp and ground beef. She said it was ok if you were intoxicated.The brighter side is our server. He was amazing! Very attentive and fast. Took care of things as needed very quickly and with a smile.  Another plus is  the branding and the merchandising.  I love good marketing, but let's back it up with a good food product."

Staff very friendly , always engage on making my experience better each time I'm there . Let's talk about the food . The quality of their meat , fish is top notch . Menu has variety of options . Not your standard Mexican restaurant I would say . My favorite is the street tacos ( Delish) , the naked chicken wings ( not fried or battered ) actually made with a dry rub and grilled , the lobster dishes on the menu are to die for and did I mention they have a nacho caramel apple pie ? So freaking amazing ! They also have a healthy meal option too and vegan ! I would highly recommend this place for food ."

            "review": "My group was hanging out on Fremont Street and people were hangry. So hangry in fact, that after attempting to find a place to accommodate 10 people, most of the group headed back to the hotel.\n\nThat left 4 of us to get something to stuff our faces with. We went with Nacho Daddy which turned out to be an awesome decision.\n\nIt was not crowded at all on a Monday night, so we were sat quickly and placed our appetizer and drink order. We went with the pulled pork BBQ nachos, which turned out to be phenomenal. The pork was good (not the best I've had but this ain't dixieland), but the sauce and queso made this spectacular. Their BBQ sauce was very tangy, with just enough sweet and a little kick at the back end. The white queso was interestingly underneath the pile of chips and toppings but it works well as it keeps the slimy chip situation to a minimum.\n\nOur margaritas took a while to obtain but were good. Mine was the house rita, which was a tad sweet but mixed strong enough and with fresh lime juice.\n\nEveryone at the table ordered various iterations of Gringo and Street Tacos. I personally got the steak filet ones which were great. I would have preferred shredded cheese to queso, but it turned out ok. Others in my party were really impressed with the shredded pork tacos. Refried beans were on point as well. The Spanish rice was unimpressive, it was a bit overcooked but had the right flavor.\n\nThe only reason I gave this only 4 stars was because the bar was a little too slow in getting drinks out. Our server was awesome! We were given great recommendations and he took a few pictures of our group since we learned he's a serious photographer!\n\nShould we find ourselves hangry or even hungry on Fremont Street again, this place will be in the short list for sure!"

When we got there, there wasn't too many people inside. We wanted to watch the TVs so we decided to eat at the bar. The bartender was very nice (I don't remember her name) and the bar was very clean. My husband ordered a beer and I had a Daddy's Michelada which was really good. I also ordered some mojo pork street tacos and my husband ordered the wings. He said the wings were good and my tacos were good but not great. I've had way better tacos in California so my standards are pretty high. Maybe I should have ordered Nachos since that is what they are known for. Overall it was a good experience and I would go again. If my tacos were amazing I would have given it 5 stars."

Our server was really friendly and energetic; no issues there. The problem was the service times! We started out with drinks that took a bit of time to get to the table. We then placed our orders and waited FORTY MINUTES for our food. Our server came over at about the 30 minute mark and said it would be out shortly. After 40 minutes I would expect some acknowledgement that the wait time was insane and maybe a comp'd serving of chips and salsa since they aren't supplied for free. \n\nThe Nacho Average Burger Nachos were tasty with melty nacho cheese, ground beef, thin crispy chips, bacon, red onion, lettuce and tomatoes. They let us know that the portion would be enough for 2 but because I love to eat, I finished it all on my own. They serve breakfast all day but my sister's breakfast burrito was sad. When you think breakfast burrito, you expect something massive. Hers was small, and filled mostly with eggs. She had to dig around for the bacon and they forgot the avocado that she added. It was a disappointing dish for her, but everyone else was pleased. I'm not sure if the 40 minute wait time was a one-off thing but I hope they adjust that soon."

And no, it is not a nightmare, because the nachos here are so good I can't think of a better place to perish than in the gooey goodness of a soggy, cheese-smothered tortilla chip from Nacho Daddy.\n\nBefore you ready any further, take a moment to appreciate the pun of the name.\n\n...It took me a while at first, so just want to make sure we're all on the same page.\n\nBREAKFAST NACHOS.

I was even inspired to make a version for my friends on a few occasions to great success, but I haven't come close to beating the original.\n\nThe one drawback to this place is the service. When we did get service it was great, but the waitstaff/bartenders were spread thin and trips to our table were few and far between.\n\nEven so, you neeeeeed to go here if you find yourself in downtown vegas.

Sigh, more fools us.\n\nWe came in on St. Patrick's night and the place was quieter than every other restaurant on the Fremont Street Experience, which should have been our first warning.  We ordered a pitcher of White Peach margaritas and the \"average burger\" nachos for me, Daddy's Supreme chicken taco for him.  Then we waited patiently, expecting the drinks to come out first.\n\nNo such luck - here comes the food.  I look over at my husband's plate and see this really sad-looking taco shell with a bunch of filling in it.  There was more plate than food, and I had a nasty feeling that the rest of the experience wasn't going to be much better than this.  My nachos, at least, had some substance.  But... they were just okay, not great.  The cheese sauce tasted like reheated Cheez Whiz, there was no bacon whatsoever to be found, and the onions were minced so finely that they just disintegrated the moment they touched my tongue.  I was bitterly disappointed.  \n\nTo make matters worse, the margaritas came when we were nearly done with our food.  Bad, bad timing.  We were pretty much ready to pack up and leave by that point.\n\nOnce the drinks came, the experience was slightly better - but, hey, I got drunk.  If it takes getting me drunk to improve things... (and my husband will tell you that he has never seen me tie one on like that, ever)\n\nFinal insult:  the bill was 53 dollars, making it the most expensive meal we had in Vegas over the course of a week.  It wasn't close to being worth that.  My husband honestly didn't want to leave a tip at all, but I convinced him otherwise.  \n\nIt never did get any busier while we were there.  I see why it didn't now.\n\nThe only reason why 2 stars - the food was edible and the drinks packed a punch.  But that's it. Servers were polite but in the end did nothing to improve our experience here.\n\nNot recommended."

The guys actually wanted to come back the next night for drunk food, it was solid.  If you happen to be downtown late at night, you should stop in."

We basically filled the whole restaurant with about 15 people there for the dinner. It's a super small place. The parking can also be hard to find, but that's everywhere downtown. \n\nI was so excited to try some of their nachos and loved the variety of options like buffalo chicken, BBQ chicken, hamburger and enchilada. I opted to go with the enchilada nachos with green sauce. Overall these bad boys were delicious! I'm glad I made the green sauce choice and the toppings were definitely not sparse. The only thing I didn't care for was how quickly the chips got soggy. I'm not a soggy chip fan so that kind of crushed my spirits. \n\nI would definitely come back again to try some more of their nacho and entree options. Oh and don't forget to check in for a free house margarita!"

Tho they claim to be, they're not as vegan or vegetarian friendly as they think. So my girlfriend is very unhappy with either one of the orders of make-shift vegetarian tacos she's had, but she loves their margaritas. One thing I will say is, there's a difference in having good service and then too much service, both times I felt like I had 6 people waiting on me, I constantly had people talking to me and felt I never had second to actually enjoy my food. Also, their whole delivery system for chips and salsa is terrible. They start by asking you which salsa I want as if I knew my options, so I ask for all at once so I can decide. Then they give you a basket of chips with these tiny little, smaller then a shotglass, cups of salsa. The chip barely fits in the cup. You kinda have to pick up the cup and pour the salsa on each individual chip. It's bananas. Has this nacho daddy character never been to a  Mexican restaurant? What is he trying to prove? They all taste great but it's almost too much work to enjoy. Last but not least, this place is a coke establishment, which is always a plus for me!"

I've had times when I can barely touch the food they give me, and three times when I'm scarfing it down like Gabriel Iglesias on taco Tuesday. This applies to both food and the drinks. There are some bartenders that if I see working I immediately know that I need to stick to my cervezas since they can't mess that up. Overall it's not bad, but it's not great. It's just workable, I'd just like consistency. The Henderson location has always been pretty good, I've heard good things about summerlin, and I liked nacho daddy when they had a booth at LIB.

Literally everyone working walked around without a smile on their face. I'm not expecting a welcome choir when I come in, but at least look like you wanna do your job.\nOur server was Debbie, I joined my party late and had to wait five minutes before leaving my table and going to the counter to get a menu. And then I waited another three minutes at the counter while two employees looked at me and kept moving. I stopped someone and asked if I place my order there or if my server does it for me, and as if my question inconvenienced him, he said my server would do it.\nThen Debbie comes to the table and without saying \"hi, welcome to Nacho Daddy\" or \"hey, how's it going\" or even \"hi\", she says \"what can I get for you?\" She REALLY made me wanna pay 15 dollars for two tacos.\nShe brought me water but didn't bring me a place setting. It'd be one thing if it was busy, but she had two other tables.\nAnd then when we asked someone else for the check, because 4 out of the 6 people had been done with their food for a while, the guy said, in a hurried tone, \"she's gonna get it, she's doing something right now.\"\nEven if Debbie was legitimately busy, there still wouldn't be an excuse for the wait time of things & her attitude on top of that added to the not-so-great experience.\n\nI don't know how my group was acting before I showed up, but even if they were some what of a hassle because they took too long to order, or couldn't decide or were constantly talking over each other, you're still in the service industry and your job is to put up with it and you deal with it every day, so buck up and deal with it.

The salsa was mediocre and the guac was underwhelmingly plain. The chips were actually pretty good. The margaritas were also mediocre. \nAnd then we had to go through this cycle again of trying to find someone to give us the check. We were going to pay with credit card, but it took so long that we ended up just paying with cash and leaving. \nAmbiance-wise, this seemed like a pretty mediocre Tex-Mex/Americanized Mexican joint. Also, they had some interesting choices for their TVs surrounding the bars. One had infomercials, just infomercials: vitamin supplements, prostate issues. Another TV had cartoons.

Nacho Daddy regularly features musical performers and artists which really helps reflect what DTLV has been focusing on for the past years.  The food is similar to the Henderson location, but seemingly in smaller portions. The street tacos are delicious and the Thai chicken nachos are a great twist and a must-try dish. Splurge on the deep-fried ice cream, its worth it!  The bar gets extra points for serving up margaritas in mason jars! Though the food is pretty good I thought it was overpriced; $14 for nachos? $10 for margaritas? Meh. \n\nService was pretty friendly on our visit though the bartenders seemed to be slacking on the drinks. Our margaritas were too sweet and they weren't that generous with the tequila. Though I'm not opposed to future visits, they are more worthy places in DTLV."

This is the only place we have visited twice and more than likely will be back once more.\nWe came back a second time and we're happy to see Jaylon, Mark and our server Rebecca .

We literally had to go up to the bar ourselves after waiting about 10 minutes for the beer we asked for twice! Also the bartender seemed to have a terrible attitude and often ignored us, that is why we left to a table hoping for better service.. The food was mediocre.. I still left a tip just to be courteous but on my way home was regretting it! Will definitely NEVER be back!!! If I could leave a smaller rating I would! The only people who were attentive were the blonde with \"sancha\" on her name tag, and the guy with the cool mustache who helped us out more than our server. Not sure if he was a cook or waiter."

We finished the drinks and food and wanted more drinks, but when we tried to get the bartenders attention he completely ignored us.  Sat there for over 20 minutes without anyone coming to get another drink order.  We even pushed our empty glasses and plate in his direction and still ignored us.  Politely shouted over the music and raised our hand, still ignored.  Awful awful awful service but it wasn't just to us, three groups on our side of the bar all experienced the same thing.  Maybe the bartender just wanted to keep serving the dude who he fist pumped since he got two rounds before anyone came our way."

In any case, I am a fan of that particular selection, although their burger nachos and chicken fried steak/egg breakfast nachos are no slouch either.\n\nA decent little location just across the way from the Neonopolis, and nestled well within Fremont Street, I liked the low-key vibe there, with their poppy music videos on the TV, and a pretty tasty Bloody Mary (also of note, their coffee selection is excellent).\n\nThe service is friendly and keeps tabs on you.  Prices are reasonable, and portions are BIG.  Come hungry, for they will hook you up if you are suffering any sort of nacho deficiency.  \n\nIn any case, I took it upon myself to visit this location four times over two weeks, if that tells you anything, and now that I'm thinking on it, some buffalo chicken nachos do sound remarkable tasty right about now.\n\nThey need delivery.  Because as strong as my need for nachos is, I'm not feeling the cold right now.\n\nWe need to work this out, Nacho Daddy...."

We were seated and served quickly, the waitress was quick, efficient and friendly. The place was good for kids because it was separated from the bar area by a wall, I am not sure how kid frinedly it would be at night with a full bar.  My 7 year old got the kids nachos, my wife got the pork tacos and I got the supreme tostada nachos. We all loved our food it was delicious. The pork taco's were the best we had ever had, the kids nachos were tasty and the cheese sauce it really good. The supreme nachos were excellent and slightly hot due to the fried jalapenos. The only complaint would be that the supreme nachos were a little smaller than I expected. My wife ordered a Mango Thai Basil Margarita and she said it was tasty and she enjoyed it. We all shared a Churro sundae and it was so good. We couldn't finish it all but we tried. It comes with chocolate, caramel and raspberry sauce with 4 churros. We had a great late lunch and it was well worth the trip to Fremont. We will definitely be back again!"

She said well it looks like you also had beers.. I said you are right we ordered the beers but were never served them.. So we got the check for our 2 shots of tequila, paid and left..

Dining options were rather slim when we were strolling between the Fremont Street Experience and the Mob Museum. We noticed too late that Tony Gemignani opened one of his pizzerias, Pizza Rock, smack in the middle of the area, and we were already in shock over the sight of the Heart Attack Grill where they let people weighing at least 350 lbs eat for free. We were grateful we didn't meet that threshold.\n\nBy comparison, Nacho Daddy seemed like a downright demure dining destination in the middle of downtown Las Vegas. It's really just as much a bar as it is a place to eat although the menu is pretty robust with not only nachos but also breakfasts, burgers, wraps and other Mexican dishes. Jamie W. was hungrier than I was and ordered the $13.50 Vegan Burrito, which was a flour tortilla stuffed mostly with wild rice with bits of Cajun-spiced tofu, black beans, vegan cheese, diced peppers and onions, mushrooms, fire-roasted corn, avocado salsita and pico de gallo (photo: http://bit.ly/1ZiHHn2).\n\nIt was quite a pile in there, but it wasn't overly flavorful for all the ingredients. I just went with the $9.95 Flour Quesadilla which was just a flour tortilla with mozzarella cheese melted inside accompanied by a mini-scoop of sour cream and pico de gallo (photo: http://bit.ly/1RZtC8F). It was alright though something I could have made on a dorm hot plate a hundred years ago. We noticed the place start to fill up with regulars mostly around the bar, but I have to give props to the manager whom I think was the one serving us since the younger server was keeping busy entertaining the bar patrons. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...middling Mexican food maybe more satisfying after a stint at the bar\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...nothing special, kinda Tex-Mex in feel\nSERVICE - 4 stars...for the unexpectedly efficient server\nTOTAL - - 3 stars...now who's your nacho daddy now?"

I ordered the vegan street tacos off of the happy hour menu. They came with tofu, black beans, cilantro, corn, hot salsa, guacamole, cabbage, and corn salsa. I was so hungry by the time the food came (my fault, there aren't many vegan restaurants in vegas!) That I happily ate the tacos. After we had already paid (not looking for anything free here) I mentioned to our bartender that most of the ingredients were missing, so she could bring it up to the kitchen. Again, because I work in the restaurant industry it was more of a tip than a complaint, because the next customer might not be so happy if this were to happen to them. When I went into the restroom, I overheard the server complaining about me in detail to someone else. I can't believe how incredibly rude and unprofessional this kind of behavior is and because of this I want to urge others not to go here because of how Allie acted."

So when a Tuesday night craving randomly arose, I decided to choose a place close to my job that offered a little bit of happy hour libations and good grub. Since they've opened, I've visited Nacho Daddy a few times. For someone who hasn't really put Mexican cuisine at the top of their list, they must be doing something right for me to continue coming back!\n\nAs successful as the Anthem location was, Nacho Daddy decided to open up shop last year in Downtown Las Vegas. This semi-hole in the wall gem of a cantina is located on 4th St., between Stewart Ave. and The Fremont Street Experience.  If you get lost, just look for the bright red and yellow neon sign accompanied with a Nacho chip man dressed in a Sombrero.  When you enter in the restaurant, you'll notice a few focal points. The first thing I noticed the partition separating the restaurant from the bar. Covered with pictures of various tequila brands, the partition really holds true to the type of restaurant this is.  There were also two garage style rolling doors offering a lot of fresh air ventilation which I appreciated on this warm evening.  \n\nEntering the full service bar, I immediately noticed the square bar top that took up almost the entire space.  Big screen TVs and projectors allowed me to watch multiple games and networks.  On my visit, Tyrone and Rick were the bartenders helping me out.  Tyrone was the one who actually took my order and stood out to me the most.  He was not only easy to talk to, but super attentive and really took the time to show me I was a valued customer.  Now that's customer service!\n\nThe partitions made me realize that margaritas were definitely in order! Call me a lush, but since this was also an important review, I thought it was only fair to try an array of flavors! So here's the deal: their margaritas run anywhere from $8-$11 depending on the flavor.  All margaritas are served in a cool mason jar and garnished with a lime wedge and salted rims. On my visit I wanted to stick to one brand of tequila, so I chose the Sauza Hornitos Plata for its spicy taste and agave origins. Here's what I got:\n\nBlackberry Acai Margarita for $10: Acai liqueur, muddle blackberries, agave nectar and homemade sweet and sour.  This drink was a bit too tart. You can definitely taste the sweet and sour flavor with a hint of the agave but the stars of the show were the blackberry and acai.  Chunks of blackberry offered a nice textured pulp and the sweetness of the acai balanced some of the tart flavor.   \n\nWhite Peach Margarita for $9: White peach liqueur and puree, fresh lime juice and sweet and sour.  What I loved about this one was that it was a lot sweeter.  Sometimes sweet and sour can get a little to tart but this drink was subtle and full of flavor.  Like sitting on the banks of Georgia!\n\nGuava Margarita for $9: Orchid guava liqueur, guava puree, fresh lime juice and sweet and sour.  This margarita was set up exactly like the white peach. Full bodied from the puree, the guava nectar really shined through.  I felt like I was on the beach in Waikiki!\n\nMango Thai Basil Margarita for $10: Thai basil, agave nectar, Mango Schnapps, mango puree, fresh lime juice and sweet and sour. I was pleasantly surprise about this one. On one hand you have the fragrant taste of a mango.  On the other, you're hit with a hint of the basil herb, breaking up the sweetness in an awesome kind of way.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this eclectic drink!\n\nAfter trying all of these amazing libations, I needed something to balance it out. Remember folks, Nacho Daddy serves food! Tyrone was nice enough to suggest the Taco Tuesday deal: 3 mix and match tacos for $3.33. I was at the point of no return. I had to take advantage of that and I'm sure glad I did. Like the margaritas, the tacos are well prepared, well-seasoned and ultimately well received. I got the pork taco, stuffed with cheese, the chicken taco stuffed with onions and cilantro and the breaded shrimp taco stuffed with cabbage, cheese and pico.  All were super flavorful, filled with the protein and delicious!\n\nWhen it's all said and done, I will rave about this place for a long time to come. I'm a huge fan of local businesses opening downtown.  This place has truly brought their success in Anthem, to the heart of Las Vegas. Whether you're in the mood for a happy hour drink, late night libation or even a brunch brewski, make your way to this awesome place, Nacho Daddy!"

Great place to go with friends, or to just sit alone at the bar and meet strangers. Filet mignon nachos were delicious. Tons of meat and cheese that really hit the spot. Our waitress was also so nice. Cherry on top was that DJ Stellar was hanging out there with his crew, and then we saw him perform an hour later! So you may just see some cool people there too while eating awesome nachos."

The place can get a little packed, as those annoying trolley pubs have this on their route and dump 20 people off trying to get shots, but it's worth the trip.  The location in Summerlin is definitely nicer, but I like the atmosphere of this place.  If you live downtown, it's a great spot.\n\nThey have vegan options on every section of the menu.  My favorite are the vegan nachos!  A real treat.  The guacamole is good to start out with and I recommend asking for the same chips that come with the vegan nachos.  You can't go wrong with the tofu fajitas either.  The portion sizes are absolutely incredible and can easily be shared.  \n\nIf you're not faint at heart, you can get a tequila shot with a scorpion in it!  Not my thing really, but everyone should try it once.  There is some good merchandise for sale.  Have a scorpion shot and get a shirt that says #gotstung!!!\n\nLike I said earlier, the place can get a little packed, so don't expect to get your food in 5 min like most tex-mex places.  It's worth the wait."

We ordered a small white queso which is served atop a small candle to keep the cheesiness smooth. Brilliant! \n\nTheir menu is extensive, but why order anything but nachos? We went for the potato nachos and the filet mignon nachos. The potato nachos are served on actual potato chips- I was expecting potato chunks on chips but oh well...what I got was okay. The filet mignon nacho plate was insane. It was way too much for one person, so order wisely! The steak was delicious as were all the other trimmings. \n\nService during the meal was great.

The place is small and cramped, and I think they could have alleviated that problem by making the bar just a bit smaller and instituting some smaller bar seats, as the seats take up to much room in the walk-ways. \n\nHappy hour consists of $5 margaritas and $4.50 Mexican beers they have on draft. Not the largest selection for a HH, but not bad. There is food on the HH menu as well. I ordered the shrimp tacos and out they came as fried shrimp tacos, which I would have liked to have known and wish the menu would have pointed that out.\n\nMy friend and I also shared a nacho platter, ahem, since we were at a place called NACHO Daddy I had great expectations. They arrived in no time and were placed on our table. As I looked at this platter of nachos I questioned many things in life, \"When a tree falls in the woods and no one is around, does it make a sound?\"... \"When I am at a place that specifically has Nachos in its' name and I am unimpressed with the nachos... are they really nachos at all?\"\n\nWe got the Filet Mignon Carne Asada Nachos. I have reservations on whether or not the meat was actually filet mignon. I also have reservations now on ever ordering a $16.95 priced plate of nachos, which I expected to be bigger, and better.\n\nNext time I want nachos I will go to Roberto's and ask for Carne Asada Nachos and I'll eat the &*&! out of those things and be happy I didn't pay $17 for them."

They serve it with gauc and salsa, both were great, but totally unnecessary-the huevos were perfect as is. Oh, Oh, Oh! They made my eggs perfectly over medium.  I don't know if you've ever ordered over medium eggs before but it's quite the gamble.  Kudos to the cooks!\nMy partner in crime ordered the Nachos and walked out with a food baby as well.  He had some super tasty raspberry margarita which totally trumped my guava daiquiri.  \n\nOn a side note:\nOur server was pretty much MIA during the meal but this was obviously due to the fact that she was in the weeds.

Mostly covered in ranch or blue cheese dressing, we are not sure which.   Service was slow, atmosphere was nothing to brag about and food was awful.    They state they make the chips, they must make them weeks before.  Ours were incredibly stale.      Won't got back any time soon, the pear margarita was ok.   However, there are plenty of other bars to drink at with much better food for the price.    I can't even give this place one star, however it made me in order to post this"

Plus I like Mexican food in all forms, so hanging out here should be easy. \n\nTurned out to be a good place to grab a solo lunch. I came in around 12:00 pm on a Monday and was just about the only customer in the place (save for the woman on her laptop at the bar, I really was it). Surprising, so I was instantly concerned the food must be bad. Or you'd need to be liquored up with a bunch of tequila to be happy here, which wasn't on the menu for me. Fortunately, the food did not disappoint but more on that in a moment. \n\nLet's talk 'bout yo daddy...\n\nNacho Daddy is larger inside than it appears from outside. There is a spacious wraparound bar and a separate dining area with plenty of seating. There is also outdoor seating with umbrellas, although they had to take them down while I was there due to excessive winds. \n\nServer Nicole was down to earth and cordial. She was training a new guy and he seemed to be catching on quick. The manager came over to say hello to me, his sole customer. : ) Nice touch. \n\nOh and the food. I had the chicken taco and can honestly say, it was one of the best taco's I've ever had. They mix some kind of pesto sauce into the taco that complements it very well.  I commented upon this just before leaving and they weren't sure what it was, but were glad I liked it. Well now, I'm glad too. \n\nThe manager's cool. The staff nice. The food excellent. The environment very comfortable. I'm not sure why it was empty both before I arrived and after I left. Maybe it's just a quiet Monday. I'll bet the place lights up at night. \n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you're downtown. Lots of options on the menu. And if you like tequila, this is your place."

This place gets automatic points from me for having a vegan menu!\n\nThe Vegan Nacho was a MOUNTAIN of ingredients including grilled peppers, onions, corn, salsa and pinto beans. There was veggie patty crumbles that I'm pretty indifferent about however the amount of mushrooms seemed to be minimal compared to the ratio of other ingredients. I also wish it had more guacamole but that's more of a personal preference. I was impressed with the amount of cheddar and mozzarella Daiya. Jalape\u00f1o chips were stacked pretty high and I was happy to see that the ingredients weren't just piled on top of the chips but layered within the dish. $15 may seem pricey for a plate of nachos but this place makes a genuine effort to make the price worth it. http://bit.ly/1Ic9mRg\n\nThe meateater BF had the Buffalo Hot Nacho which he devoured. I think that means he liked it.\n\nService was friendly and the atmosphere is casual. I appreciated that this place wasn't overly cranking the AC like most places do. I understand that Vegas weather is hot but it's inconvenient to have to carry a light sweater just to stay warm indoors.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan! I predict that we'll be back to check out other items on the vegan menu :)"

I've tried several of their dishes and have never walked away with that \"wow\" factor. Their nachos are very satisfying, and they come with a heap load of toppings to ensure that every chip has some kind of yumminess on it. The BBQ nachos are the best, in my opinion. \n\nI've tried their filet beef street tacos. The beef is cut into very small pieces, and then topped with a sprinkle of onions and cilantro. The food is then placed on two mini corn tortillas. The tacos do the job, don't get me wrong, but the meat was a bit overcooked to my liking, and I had to add a bit of hot sauce to keep the tacos moist. Again, not a terrible meal.   \n\nMy favorite thing on the menu is their fish tacos. This is definitely a dish I would go back for!! The fish is slathered in herbs and spices and then thrown on the grill for good measure. The well flavored filet is then topped with cabbage and a little salsa, but the best part is the thick handmade tortilla it comes on. Everything works together well, and two of these babies will definitely leave you with a smile. \n\nThe service at Nacho Daddy is okay, and the environment is relaxing with a nod to the famous 90's bands playing on the TVs. All in all, I'll be back."

His margarita suggestion was taken, and enjoyed. My spicy vegan burrito was one of the best burritos I have ever eaten.\n\nWe loved this place so much, we went back the next day! Luis was our server again, the food was amazing again, and the equally awesome manager, Tyler, even gave us a yummy churro sunday on the house! At that point I just wanted to move in.

We ate it so fast I didn't even take a picture. \nThe buffalo nachos needed more queso blanco, I had to order a side of it because it felt like I was just eating chips covered in buffalo sauce. \nThe strawberry margarita was very tasty.

I was downtown and so Nacho Daddy. \nThey are open later than a lot of other food serving place in DT (short of a casino coffee shops) and there are times of day you can actually park in front of the place, I believe it's before 10pm. \n The crowd and the vibe is very all over the place, you never know if there will be a drunk girl throwing up in the bathroom or if someone will slap you on the shoulder and ask about \"what's good here\", but if I didn't like that, I'd live in Henderson."

I can't believe they claim they are voted the best in town and I am shocked they haven't changed the recipe after the feedback I've heard from other people that have had them. \n\nSecondly, it seems they always have the giant front roll up door open even on extremely hot days. If your going there between may and August, be ready to sweat! Not the best environment for enjoying a nice lunch or dinner. \n\nIf you stick with the ice cold beer they offer and go either at night, or in the fall/winter, you will have a 5 star experience!"

It was more like a pastry crust rather than a flour tortilla, but it was very good.  The menu says that all breakfast tacos are served with potatoes or refried beans and rice.  I was offered neither.  I did have a choice of mild, medium, or hot for the salsa and I chose hot.  It's mildly hot if that's not an oxymoron.\nBreakfast was good and the server refilled my coffee when he saw I was getting low.\n\nThis place just opened a month ago and they're still doing work on it.  This morning, they were installing a garage door in the bar area that can be raised in good weather and serve from a counter on which the door rested today.\n\nPart of the fun of eating here today was watching my server change the Coke cartridges.  The syrup now comes in super concentrated containers that look like copy machine cartridges and it was interesting watching him switch out two of the cartridges. The change in technology was interesting.\n\nI parked underground in the Neonopolis garage and there was no charge.  I don't know if it's because of the time of day or that I was there less than an hour, but this is the second time that the cashier at the pay station just wished me a good day and opened the gate.\n\nNacho Daddy is worth a return visit when they get the kinks worked out.

            "review": "After strolling around Fremont on a rainy day, we were ready to dry off and get a bite to eat. At the suggestion of our friend and local Las Vegas guide, we headed over to Nacho Daddy. I honestly think that had she not suggested it, I never would have noticed it. Not only is it off a side street near Fremont but it's also not flashy like many Vegas restaurants and we almost walked by it.\n\nThe inside is simple but what the restaurant lacks in decor, it seems to make up in quality of food. Everyone was pleased with their dishes, from quesadillas to burritos to nachos.\n\nWhile I was tempted to order the nachos, I knew that I could never finish a plate of nachos on my own. It's too bad that they don't offer half orders of the nachos. Instead, I chose the chicken quesadilla. It was one of the best quesadillas that I've ever had. It was filled with gooey cheese and juicy shredded chicken and served with a side of sour cream, guacamole and pice de gallo. Had I not been on vacation, I would have been content to eat half and take the rest to go but instead I forced myself to finish the quesadilla and was pleasantly stuffed for quite awhile. \n\nTwo of my friends shared the Fiesta Nacho and managed to clear the plate between the two of them. These nacho plates are definitely something to share with a friend though, unless you're a super heavy eater. Another friend ordered the vegan burrito and I was impressed that a Mexican restaurant offered several vegan options. \n\nCompared to places on the Strip, prices at Nacho Daddy are very reasonable. My quesadilla cost about $12 with tax and tip, which isn't much different than what I pay in San Diego. The nacho plates ranged from $7.50 for cheese nachos to $16ish for nachos with meat and lots of toppings."

Nacho cheese!  *ba-dum-tissss* Thanks folks, I'll be here all week.  \n\nAfter sampling some of their delicious bbq nachos at the last yelp event, I was eager to go here.  I finally got my chance yesterday 11-15-15 at 11:30 AM.  This restaurant is located on 4th street which is right smack dab in the middle of the fremont street madness.  We parked in the fremont parking garage and it cost $2.  \n\n\n$35.74 got me a bloody mary, a triple dip appetizer, and a barbecue pulled pork sandwich.  Our server, Jon, was very attentive and brought us a high chair, crayons, and a kids menu for the boy.  \n\nThe bloody mary experience was unique to me....it was a bloody mary DIY bar.  For $8 they give you a mason jar with ice and Absolut in it, and then you go up to the bar and make it the way you want it.  They had bloody mary mix, pickles, celery, hot sauces, cucumbers, olives, lemons, etc. I thought that was pretty neat.  \n\nThe triple dip ($11.95) consisted of white queso dip, guac, and salsa, and it came with the world's saltiest chips (see photo).  That queso dip....oh wow....I wish I could fill up a jacuzzi with it and drink my way out.  It was heavenly.  Their guac, however, was yucky.  It tasted like the kind you can buy at Wal-mart.  I would have given this place 5 stars if their guac was good and I didn't have to wade through smelly street performers to get there.  \n\nThe pulled pork sandwich was awesome...so juicy and messy!  It came with piping hot fries that I really enjoyed dipping in the queso dip.  My only critique would be that the pork was in large chunks and I prefer it more shredded.  \n\nYay! I'm a fan.  Next time I'm getting the buffalo nachos and street corn."

We were greeted inside and it was a beautiful day out despite the wind so we opted for the patio seating.  He said no problem and immediately noticed the table needing to be wiped be cause of rain and dust in the air recently.  He quickly got a rag and took care of the issue with out us requesting.  \nGood eye Ric.  \n\nHe took our drink order promptly and brought them out at the same pace.  We were not in a rush by any means but ussually we like to get service going quickly because of the kids and there short attention span.  Ric followed up for our order when he could. There was another group asking him what seemed like 1000 questions but like I said I understood the circumstances.  We were just enjoying the weather andthe kids were coloring because Ric was ontop of it and brought us the color pages and crayons.  \n\nWe began to inquire about food options at Nacho Daddy regarding portions and veggie options and he informed us they had an entire page dedicated to Vegan eating.  Sweet! Mom said.  This was our first meal of the day even though it was 5 in the afternoon.  So Ric quickly brought us a great bucket of chips, two salsas, and cheese dip like queso fundido type thing.  All were very good. Salsa tasted fresh and homemade with a little bit of heat.  Cheese dip was good also.\n\nMom went with the Black Bean Burger and could not decide between garlic or sweet potato fries, Ric quickly responded with I can split between both if you like.  Awesome job again my friend.  I went for the BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos, which had very good flavor and a huge portion.  My one issue with this dish is that it tasted like the pork had been sitting in the hotwell all day so the meat was very tough and chewy.  My jaw bones seriously hurt after finishing this dish.  I am not one to complain but that issue did not stop me from killing the entire plate.  I give the dish a 3.5 star out of 5 because of the chewyness. Mom had no issues with her burger and fires she had no trouble crushing this dish either.  \n\nOverall great first experience.  Ric made it 5 stars.  He is possibly one of the best in all of DTLV.  We had to speak to the manager to let her know about how great Ric was.  We will be back to visit Ric soon.  The food was also good enough to come back and explore the menu further.  Thanks for the good time."

A restaurant that serves nachos and tequila open the breakfast? This definitely looks like a place for late night boozing. Attractive, young waitstaff and 90's 'nostalgia' music that I clearly remember as a full grown adult. Nothing will make you feel your age faster than nostalgia that you're too old to care about. The drinks section takes up half their menu. Bar food makes up the rest. We got the nachos because it's in the name so you'd think they'd be good. They were pricey but plentiful. This is a good place to go if you've got expendable income and you would rather blow it on a night out with friends instead of something sensible like video poker. Not my kind of thing but I'm not their audience. If you want to spend your paycheck on shots of tequila and tortilla chips then you might love it."

Answer was yes. 23 minutes passed , no service so she went inside ordered 2 shots of Julio 42 and a Reposado.  Finally a server with Bunny ears came out and took our food order.\nReally piss poor service.  I get it.  Downtown deals with tourists equals crappy service.  Hopefully your new store in Summerlin will care about and cater to locals.  Will give it one last try.  Thx Earle\nWe stopped in to check ND's out.  Heard about Nachos from watching it on the TV show Mystery Diners. Also a big sign out front advertising $5 tacos and $6 Titos \nWe sat at the Bar and had a great time talking with him. The day we dined was National Taco Day as well as Vodka Day. Go figure. Tacos and Vodka.  With that said.  Nachos had $6 Titos cocktails. So we had street tacos and Titos \nLater that evening we decided to return with a friend for a cocktail. We ordered 3 Titos and service was really slow \"different bartender\"  took forever to pay.  Got the bill and the bartender charged us $9 a drink instead of the posted $6 price. After some discussion they finally adjusted the bill. Then sent a guy out front to take down the posted special sign.  Not sure if or when we will return"

When I got home later that night and cleaned by bag, I realized that I was charged for than double price for my entree. I called the next morning hoping that the problem could be corrected via phone. I was told that I had to physically go downtown, which is a hassle from Aliante. I asked for gas for the inconvenience. Anthony, the manager, proceeded to call me a liar among other things.. just completely unprofessional.\n\nI was later allowed to come collect the difference. The server confirmed her mistake.

As a frequent customer of the Eastern location until it closed, it was night and day.  \n\nWalking in on a Saturday evening we figured it would be busy.   There were seats open at the bar so we snagged them up.   I wish we didn't.  The service around the bar was absolutely horrid.  First off it took them ten minutes to acknowledge our existence to take our drink order. Since we already knew what we wanted to share, we put in our order right away before she left.  That was the last we saw of our original waitress.  45 minutes later our food comes out.  It was delivered by another waiter and he asked if we needed anything else.  I politely asked for hot sauce as well as our plates and napkins.   Did we see him again?  No.  Was our waitress in sight? No.  So we are sitting there with our drinks empty for the last 25 minutes without regular place settings to eat.  My friend actually went back to the kitchen to see if we could get any assistance. He got their attention.\n\nAs we started to eat our so called Nachos, it was abundantly clear they were inedible.  The flavor was way off.  The entire bottom of the plate was water.  I would like to refer to these plate of nachos as nacho soup.  As if those weren't bad enough, the fajita sandwich tasted as if it was made the day before and sitting under heat lamps.  Was I in the twilight zone?  I just want to also mention we did not see our waitress during this entire time.  \n\nEventually we were able to flag down another person to pay our bill.  We wanted to get out of there and never look back.  Just a disappointing experience."

My friends and I went here as suggested our friend who lives in Vegas and let me tell you I will always listen to him for his food recommendations. This place was so yummy and had a cool vibe to it. Very clean and our server Eva was awesome. Very personable and knew the menu well. We all got nachos myself the ones with the pulled BBQ pork and white cheddar and cilantro. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. I definitely recommend them. My husband got the hamburger nachos and those were very yummy. One of our friends got the tacos and man oh man was the tortilla delish. House made by the chef himself and the best thing we had ever tried. We tried asking for the recipe but they wouldn't share their secret recipe. Although Eva told us they were in the process of creating a cook book and to look for it in May! Man I can't wait til May so I can be one of the firsts in line to purchase all the yummy dishes. Thank you Nacho Daddy and Eva we had a wonderful time."

Griffin, our excellent waiter, said he'd get the bbq sauce on the side because the kitchen can sometimes be heavy-handed with it, which was perfect, as my husband and I have differing levels of love for it. The nachos were spot on. So good that I nearly ordered a second variety as my entree!  Wayne ate fajita cheese steak with parmesan garlic fries. I had fajita chimichanga with green sauce. Both were outstanding.  We will be making Nacho Daddy's a regular stop on our annual trip out here from now on."

Total bill for all 3 not to exceed 600.00 total or 200.00/couple. \n\nAll 6 of us have been to & loved the Henderson location so when Nacho Daddy opened in the DTLV it was our 1st choice to go to for dinner. \n\nWe arrived still a bit sated and slightly tipsy from our last stop. *not to worry we who live in Vegas make sure not to drink & drive* \n\nWhen we arrived *slightly late but we called* they had our table all ready & waiting. Our server was Chris who was amazing at keeping our glasses full. \nWe started with a round of Lambics - just to clear the palate. \nFollowed by a pitcher of perfect Margaritas. Normally not the best idea because for some reason in other places we've found that the pitcher method loses some of the quality of the actual cocktail. Not in the case of the Big Daddy's. consistent tot he last drop. \n\nFor food - we decided on 3 different types of nachos\n\nFlorentine: Chicken Spinach & asiago cheese. \nvery light & different from the nachos we've had previously. Excellent choice for a vegetarian as they will make them - the chicken. By far my personal favorite. Kind of like a nice spinach dip with the chips already in. \n\nThai Chicken:  not my personal favorite but everyone else loved them. Basically it was a nice pad thai on nacho chips and very SPICY. it was very flavorful but I was enthralled with the Florentine.\n\nFiesta Chicken Nachos: Closest to what is expected in a traditional American nachos amped up with the addition of the diablo sauce. One of the \"boys\" tried to lick the plate. \n\nSpeaking of \"boys\" the urinal block is hysterical. yes I looked. \n\nWe each had an order of corn on the cob & shared 2 bowls of the queso dip. \n\nFood:  consistent with the Henderson location. \nService: Exceptional. Chris gets 5 ***** (for vegas, someone that attentive to a large party is very unusual) \nFat Friendly:  All seats were armless so no hip issues. also spaced far enough apart that we didn't have to sit back to back with our neighbor. Maybe because it was a Tuesday night in off season, but there was ample room. Doubt that would be the case during Life is Beautiful or EDC. \nAmbiance: much more cosy & conducive to conversation than the Henderson location. \n\nTotal bill including tip: $206.00 \n\nIt was a great choice & w've been back since and still consistent with the food & the services!"

As we walk up to the door I hear music, people talking and laughing I immediately perk up thinking this place is going to be fun and amazing.... we walk past the hostess stand which is outside of the door, we look around I see a few bartenders, servers  and Busboys yet not one bothered to say Hi or  acknowledge us. I finally walk up to the bar and asked if I could sit anywhere? She looked shocked that the hostess wasn't out side and the then was nice enough to give us menus and found a good table for us. The waiter was nice informed us of the drink specials. I decided to get a Daddy's Michelada and OMG it was like unicorns and rainbows Amazing!!! And it's the main reason they are getting 3 stars... for the appraiser we ordered Queso Dip although the presentation was good the actual Queso was very bland no flavor at all and overall disappointing. Finally for my Entr\u00e9e I ordered the Smothered Burrito with chicken and the green sauce it was okay. It was a little bland. The only thing that saved my Burrito was the sauce it was drenched in. The chicken on it's own was dry. Now I didn't go in thinking it was going to be authentic Mexican food but I did expect for the food to have some flavor and it didn't. I also did have the Guacamole and Pico with chips and that was really good. I might come back to give it another chance but it definitely won't be any time soon. Unless I'm in the mood for a Daddy's Michelada."

In fact, when I received it I was quite surprised to discover how many NOT covered chips there were. They could have done away with about two thirds of the chips, but they basically use the chips as a way to present you with a pile high plate, even though the good stuff is not as plentiful as it could have been. Still delicious. Just not as \"Oh my God\" as I was lead to believe.\n\nNow for the taco:\nI had the barbacoa taco - Now this deserves the \"OH MY GOD!!\" It was DELICIOUS!! In fact, I wish I had ordered a couple more and NOT gotten the nachos. The meat was seasoned PERFECTLY!!

My friend and I had never been here before and the waitress recommended the Fiesta Nachos as one of the popular dishes.  I thought they were just okay.  The chips could have been hotter in my opinion.  Considering this place specializes in nachos I guess I was expecting to be blown away.  I don't see myself coming back here unless it's another invite type situation."

Nachos are delish and finger licking good. \nAlso grab some street tacos off the appetizer menu. Small snack size tacos. Pick any meat to be served in two thin corn tortillas. The chicken meat was perfectly grilled and slightly burnt which gave the perfect amount of crunch. Yum!\n\nThis located is located a little turn off Fremont street. A great stop to cool off from the Vegas heat with some cocktails and munchies!!"

            "review": "I went here a couple of weeks ago for lunch. We dined at the down town location. Cute name. Clearly marketing to the tourists as there is a bar that opens to the street. Medium sized dining area. What put me off almost immediately is when I went to the website lunch specials were listed. However, when I went there the waitress new nothing about it and asked the manager, the manager then came over and explained that the lunch specials were only for the Henderson location and not downtown. I will own up that it was my mistake upon review of the website again when you download the menu it states Henderson menu and when you scroll down to the very bottom then there is a cover sheet stating Las Vegas menu that does not list lunch specials. Nonetheless, this left a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nAs to the food, a bit pricey in my opinion for what you get. I will admit that I am a nacho snob - I love nachos and if I am going to splurge they better be darn good. I like traditional nachos piled high with gooey cheese (love the nachos at Big Dog's) and avant-garde nachos such as the asian nachos at Grand Luxe. The nachos sounded good, we ordered the cheeseburger nachos and bbq pulled pork nachos. The queso sauce was smooth and creamy and the pulled pork was sweet although not great bbq but I didn't expect that from here.  Cheeseburger nachos, well, were like a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, ground beef etc. They were approximately $10 each. They were good but again nothing phenomenal and for the price not a whole lot there. I was full but had I been any hungrier would not have been. And I am pretty sure other people in the group were not full. There were three plates of nachos shared among four people. \n\nThey had one of those new help yourself Coke machines with the different flavors. Overall I have mixed feelings about the Coke machine. You have to get your own drink which I am okay with but if there is anyone standing at the drink machine you may be in for a long wait as they ponder their drink selection.  Anyway, cute idea but I won't be coming back."

The last person answered again, I said I wanted to talk to the manager, places on hold again for another few minutes. The manager answered, I spoke with her about how ridiculous it is to have to wait that long to try to pay for my food over the phone...the order vanished, however she knew it was supposed to be a bbq chicken nacho and a chicken fiesta nacho. She was basically having to retake the order, \"the computers are down\" I was told. I ended up just canceling the order because the amount of time it took for me to be on the phone, I could have walked down to Fremont street and eaten something by the time the order and delivery would have even happened. The only reason why I'm giving it a 2-star rating is because the manager offered me a gift card if I should decide to order with them again.  I can't even base my review of their food, it is purely all based off of customer service. ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS TO PAY FOR IT OVER THE PHONE...WHO SERIOUSLY DELIVERS WITHOUT ASKING FOR UPFRONT PAYMENT OR ASKING IF IT'S CASH???? Oh wait, they do."

This restaurant has the fancy Ferrari designed Coca Cola machine so I indulged in a Cherry Coke. We decided to share an order of nachos, tostada style, and an order of grilled mahi mahi tacos. The tacos turned out to be one in the case of the fish option, but our server insisted it would be enough food. Our server and the others seemed very young and not supervised, but were all very smiley and all kept busy even though the restaurant was quiet. \nThe food came out very quickly and was really good! The taco was my preference, I will totally order it again. A fresh flour tortilla, slightly crisper and loaded with two small tender mahi filets, cabbage, chipotle cream, salsa cruda. It was so delicious I almost couldn't stop eating at the halfway mark! The nachos were very good as well, loaded with seasoned beef, refried beans, Pico de gallo, queso and shredded cheeses, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, fried jalapenos. \nI highly recommend this place for quick lunch or late bar bites. Really accessible menu for picky groups. I'll have to try a burger next time for sure."

She was in the mood for nachos, so coming here was a no-brainer. \n\nUpon entering, we were thrown off by having to seat ourselves. It was kind of packed, so finding a table in the back took a minute. There was a large party in the center that seemed to be taking up everyone's attention, so it was about 5 minutes before we even got menus and another 5 before we got to speak with our server.  Fortunately, that gave us time to decide what we wanted to order, so we ordered as soon as he arrived. \n\nIt took nearly 45 minutes to get our food, but again, that was due to the large party in the center. The food was fresh when it arrived, but was mediocre at best.\n\n Her nachos were over-saturated with this extremely spicy salsa. The amount of cheese on the nachos gave the impression that ANY cheese on there was merely an accident. It was primarily a plate of chips and salsa, garnished with chicken and a few vegetables. \n\n I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was amazing. The fries were great while they were piping hot. However, as soon as they cooled down, they became hard as a rock and hazardous to my health. I couldn't finish even half of them (and there weren't a lot to begin with).\n\n The part that gives this experience 3 stars (and not 1 or 2, as the food was quite a disappointment) was the service. Our server was Danny, and the little amount of service the party in the center allowed him to give us was excellent. \n\nOverall, it was a decent experience. Not one I intend to repeat any time soon, though."

With all of the excellent food offerings in the downtown Las Vegas area, it is extremely important to put ones best foot forward on the food scene. There were several strikes for this restaurant in my opinion, the first being that as soon as my family was seated, we were ignored for at least 15 minutes. With the menu having been studied for at least that long, we were ready to order. The waiter breezed up, took my drink order for ONE BEER and left without getting the food order. The waiter breezed up with the beer, took the food order of filet mignon nachos and an order of shrimp ceviche. The sad nachos arrived to the table with very little cheese, drowned is a terrible sauce, low presence of steak, and sad looking guacamole. The chips were fresh. The ceviche was a no. All around...a no. No flavor, nothing, period! The avocado was fresh. Oh yeah, I wanted another beer, no one ever came back to the table. Once done with dinner, we waited, and waited, and waited for the bill. Finally it shows up and guess how much 1 beer, 1 plate of nachos, and 1 ceviche appetizer cost...OVER FIFTY DOLLARS! Are you kidding me!?! That's even unreasonable for Vegas! We weren't on the main strip. Not even on the Fremont Street strip. I do not recommend this place AT ALL."

The chorizo was mild and not what I find in a Mexican supermarket. \nMy girlfriend ordered the green enchilada. She loved it. The sauce was the most notable. The refried beans however, should have came from a different can. The rice was good. A little crunchy but the enchiladas made her forget. \nThe big day burrito was fucking good, said my friend.

She said she would be able to make my coffee, but not right away. She would later just forget (thank god for the manager who came over and made it for her). After ordering, the restaurant filled up with runners from the Color Run. \n\nAs service slowed to a crawl, our food came out. Well, only some of it. And it was the wrong order. 30 minutes later, our order still was not complete. 40 minutes had passed, we gave up and we asked for our check. The server eventually got us our check but charged us twice for the food we never got. After correcting that mistake, she failed to give us back our credit card. It was time to leave to avoid more and more errors. After a morning of below average service, we left. \n\nHere is the good part. As this was rare service from this location, I went back later to discuss it with the area manager. She was very apologetic and kind. She wanted us to return and make up for the errors from that morning. She said she would discuss the problem with the server and see if there was a systems failure during breakfast times. \n\nI appreciated the proactive nature of the area manager. Serving can be a tough job and some days are better than others. While our experience was below average, it was corrected by a manger willing to listen and correct the errors. \n\nThank you Nacho Daddy for responding to customers needs!"

I was really excited about trying their Nachos, expecting something unique that would set them apart from typical Nachos at any other bar/grille. \n\nThey were certainly short handed, because we ordered our drinks and then after what seemed like forever, we had to find our server to make our order.\n\nI ordered the Enchilada Nachos, my wife ordered the Vegan Nachos, my daughter ordered the chicken fingers. \n\nIt was alright. I kept thinking that I could have done far better myself. Maybe I just ordered the wrong item, but my wife absolutely hated her Vegan Nachos. So I tasted one of hers and the cheese tasted horrible. She almost asked them to take it back, but we couldn't find our server for so long that she ended up forcing down half of it by the time he came back around and it didn't seem right.\n\nMy daughter's chicken fingers were very good! At least they got that right.\n\nSo, if you're looking for nachos that make you say, 'meh', get the Enchilada Nachos. If you are starving and long for cheese that tastes like melted plastic, get the Vegan Nachos.\n\nBut if for some reason you find yourself in this average restaurant and you aren't the 'risk-taking' type, ask for the kid's menu and order the chicken strips. They are called 'pull my finger'."

They sounded like they would be tasty from the menu description. My expectation was that the chicken would be shredded, since that's how it always is in enchiladas. Instead, there were little cubes of dried out chicken. I expected some enchilada sauce to be mixed in with the chicken, but instead the nachos were a wet, greasy mess. Enchilada sauce had been dumped over all of the chips. I ate about a quarter of the food. That was all I could stomach. I ended up having a \"sour\" stomach for nearly three hours after the meal.\n\nMy friend had what she always has - the Big Daddy burrito. She loves it. When it came, it was obviously smaller than what it had been in the past. She stated that they must have changed the recipe because it just didn't taste the same. In the past, they always had brought a small plate with sour cream and lettuce on it, too. She asked to speak to the manager who came over after we had completed the meal.\n\nThe manager insisted that there hadn't been any change to the recipe and that the burrito had never come with the small plate of lettuce and sour cream. She seemed uninterested in inquiring why most of my food was still on the plate. Eating here really seems to be a crap shoot."

I was so disappointed that we traveled all the way downtown just to be told we couldn't get what I wanted. Oh well, we ordered food anyway.\n\nThe food itself was pretty good. My cheesy nachos had delicious queso, though it was lacking the amount of jalapenos we would have liked. We asked for a side of them extra. But, our server/bartender forgot and we had to ask again 15 minutes later.\n\nMy boyfriend also ordered one of the burritos. He really liked it, and it was a generous size. He gobbled it all down. I didn't try it myself, but I trust his judgement.\n\nWe also had to ask for refills for our water, which was challenging because she spent most of her time talking to a couple and group on opposite sides of the bar.\n\nI'm pretty set on trying these scorpion shots. But next time I will call first.\n\nEDIT:\n\nJust added another star to this review because I was immediately contacted by the restaurant owner to apologize for my experience. I was offered a comp and to be contacted when scorpions come in. I'm very impressed. And I am hoping very much that I can give them another try when I come back to Vegas next year! :)\n\nEDIT AGAIN: Bartender just contacted me to apologize to me too. Seriously, this place is wowing me with their customer service. I just have to give another star. I'm going to be back next year and will definitely come here."

I was so excited because I had been to the location in Henderson and always had good food andxservice.\n\nI was a little disappointed as the downtown location is much smaller and the decor is super urban. There is a small seating area of 2-4 person tables (about 10) and a wall that seperates the bar area with counter height seating. It fits the downtown scene but I don't find that seperation comfortable. \n\nThe menu is not the same as what's online or what is at the Henderson location. This menu has less items which was disappointing because I was raving to all of my friends about their delicious quesadillas and it wasn't there. We were also told by the staff that there were items available at the bar were not available on the menu. In the end we got our quesadillas but it was confusing. \n\nOur party was about 13 people and the servers were very good at getting our food and drinks without too long of a wait. I had the burger nachos which was delicious and a raspberry margarita which was a little too sweet but good. My boyfriend had steak fajitas and a skinny margarita and was very satisfied. We ordered the smore's nachos for dessert and that was epic!

I was a little disappointed, which made me sad because this was my birthday dinner AND I'd heard so many good things about Nacho Daddy!\n\nI made a reservation two weeks prior for 20 people. I called that afternoon to confirm the reservation. (\"yep, we have it, no problem!\"). When we arrived, no one seemed to know what we were talking about! Luckily, they weren't super busy, so they were able to set something up for us, but that definitely put a sour taste in my mouth to start.\n\nSecondly,  the menu is NOT the same as what is posted online (only the Henderson location  posts their menu). This was especially disappointing because I'd already planned out what I wanted, but lo and behold, it wasn't on their menu. The menu of the Downtown location is much more abbreviated. \n\nI ended up ordering the BBQ nachos, which were good, but the sauce was very strong, and there was a lot of cilantro. We also had chips & salsa. The chips were great, and the salsa very hot. \n\nI also had a Raspberry Margarita, which was super sweet! I like sweet drinks, but this was even too sweet for my taste.  \n\nWe also got an order of the s'mores nachos to share and sing Happy Birthday to me! They were okay. Just beware that the marshmallow sauce is REALLY sticky! Just passing it around the table, a girl got some of it stuck in her hair, and I know I got some  on my face and it was hard to get off!\n\nThe service was very friendly and casual, but I think they were a little strapped for servers (it looked like they might have only had 2 and 1 or 2 bartenders?), so they didn't come back to check on us and our needs too often. \n\nI do want to check out the Henderson location, but I don't know that I'll return to ND downtown."

Too much kale and not enough toppings. The dressing, which was an oily citric concoction, didn't add flavor. \n\nFilet Mignon Carne Asada Nachos ($16.95): We paid 16 bucks for some bland-ass  nachos. Though they were loaded with guacamole, pico de gallo, refried beans, cilantro, and \"filet mignon,\"  these were disappointingly flavorless. \n\nThe carne asada nachos here don't even stack up to what my neighborhood Roberto's offers, or any kind nachos offered elsewhere.

She was really friendly and actually pleasant to talk to. Refreshing for a Fremont bartender. Food was solid we had the enchiladas and queso. Couple of bloody Mary's which were surprisingly good and they had bacon in it which is always great! Their coffees are good just wouldn't recommend the Mexican latte. Overall experience was good. If you want a margarita or a relaxed atmosphere. Check it out."

            "review": "It was a morbidly cold night on a Wednesday, with wind chill it was probably 40 degrees. Which absolutely disrespected the shit out of my unprepared Southern California clothing. \n\nMy comrade and self decided so seek shelter in a place called nacho daddy. We parked our steeds outside and approached the two far end seats of the bar \"it was near empty in there\". I started off as any self respecting male would. With a water on the rocks \"of which I was heckled for by the bartender, but I didn't care because I was parched of my vast travels of the sema auto show.\" Anyway, After looking at my menu for all of 37.4 seconds I knew the tostada nachos were the meal to warm my near lifeless body. The friendly female bartender had enough of my shenanigans after I placed my order and slid me a Miller lite across the bar and said drink up. Little did I know this Miller would be the beginning of the end. As I finished my beer my comrade decided the remainder of the night would be spent with shots. \"Jameson and pickle juice\". After several shots \"more like 7\" along with everything else I had pre gamed with at a city called New York New York. Where we traded beads to a man in a type of chair with wheels and no legs in to get directions. l knew I had fucked up. The nachos were transported from the kitchen to the bar in a backhoe that somehow they made fit in such a tiny spot. I'm not a big person by any means so these nachos made my hand look like that little person from Austin powers. I didn't know how to attack this battle without making a huge mess or drawing attention to myself. I somehow managed to rig myself a harness from napkins and straws to suspend myself from the ceiling as to not make a mess on myself. \n\nLol now that you've probably read the majority of this review I'll take a second to actually say the bartender was attentive, friendly/assholeish \"in a good way\" and the food runners were awesome as well. I recommend sharing the mound of happiness they call food with the duggar family because I barely made a dent in it. I've been to this location several times, they never give me a reason to not come back. The company was better on Fremont, as opposed to the overpriced hooker sitting  next to me at the bar blowing her second hand dick smoke in my face."

We ordered the grilled Mexican corn on the cob, which was to die for. We both could've had five more of those. The nachos themselves were fantastic, and huge! And for dessert we got the fried ice cream, which comes with chocolate and vanilla tortilla chips, which were probably even better than the fried ice cream. Service was great, food was great, atmosphere was great... Very pleased."

I ordered a michelada based on the pic in the menu, what I got was a beer with Tabasco & lime in a cup used for water. The rim had an enormous amount of margarita salt. And I have no idea what kind of beer was used since the waitress didn't ask me. The filet minon nachos were ok. Nuthin to write home about. The meat was not as tender as I had hoped. Crab & lobster street tacos were ok, they stuff more corn in it than the crab/lobster.

The dining area was pretty busy, we were told to seat ourselves at the only available table and a server came over fairly quickly to inquire if a highchair was needed (it was). \n\nWe started out by ordering drinks, I had a moscow mule which was served in a silver mug (I should dock Nacho Daddy one star just for that BS). For an appetizer, we got the triple dip which is queso dip, guacamole and salsa. The guacamole was chunky and looked great but lacked seasoning, and queso dip came with sliced jalapenos in it however no heat could be detected by anyone in our group, which became the standard for our evening. \n\nMy husband got a combo which was a 1/2 a sandwich and a bowl of the ghost pepper chili. My brother in law had the ghost pepper chili nachos. Both commented on the lack of heat in their meals. The shrimp bowl I had was fine, as was the quesadilla that my sister in law had. Nothing was exceptional though. \n\nFor me there are too many good places to dine downtown for me to go back to a place that was 'just okay' anytime soon. Sorry Nacho Daddy, you just didn't do it for me."

Focusing on the MEH quality of the MEHnu, however, is missing the point-- Nacho Daddy is not about Michelin Stars, it's about FUN! So leave your foodie-badge at home, get some friends together, get yourselves sloshed, and scarf down the nachos for a killer good time in Downtown Vegas!\n\n3   S T A R S\n\n* NACHOS + BOOZE CAN'T LOSE\n:::: The Nachos -- The perfect BOOZE FODDER! Nacho-greatest example of gourmet Tex-Mex, but PHENOMENALLY SATISFYING when you're 2 beers and 2 shots deep, and about to take a video of your poor homie chewing up and swallowing a dead scorpion on a dare. Please be courteous and vomit outside!\n\n* PARTY PALAZZO\n'Palazzo' means PALACE in Italian, as in watch your PALs get drunk off their ASSes! This is VEGAS BABY, so get STUFFED & get TRASHED, and this is a great place to do both! Rush in with your new crew of friends you just made Downtown & go 18-Dummy off their grande Tequila selection (60 varieties) while deep-throating MORE NACHOS (gross)! Watch the game on one monitor, or hilariously tacky old 70's and 80's music videos on the other, in between scorpion-shots and INSTAGRAM-selfies!\n\n* THANKS FOR THE MEHmories\nI will never in my life forget this meal. I walked into a big, fun space for lunch, was waited on by a super-cool server named Elicia, devoured one  disappointing MEH dish after the next, and finished with an unforgettably bad Las Vegas decision--the Scorpion Shot! My life on this planet has been made slightly more significant by this wacky bit of suffering.\n\n2   M I N U S E S\n\n- MEHlancholy MEHnu\nDon't walk in by yourself as a foodie because you'll feel like a fool :) Let's find out why...\n:::: Carnitas Tacos -- Utterly Bland. If you've ever experienced eye-fluttering ecstasy from expertly crafted tender-juicy-crispy-salty carnitas tacos then DO NOT order them here. It'll MEHk you sad.\n:::: Battered Fish Taco -- Decent. Best thing I ordered. Great texture, good flavors.\n... So then I tried to redeem the meal with what I thought would be a guaranteed winner, but it was even more MEH!\n:::: MEHxican Roasted Corn -- Like a disappointing Tinder date. She seemed so hot until we MEHt. Too little mayo, too little cotija cheese, no chili powder, no lime, and the corn was wet roughage--not sweet enough. Complete fail.\n\n- SCORPION SHOT: MASOCHISTS ONLY!\nProbably the go-to hazing ritual of UNLV fraternities. On par with eating a rotten shrimp head from the bottom of a Panda Express dumpster. Chewing into the guts of the scorpion, realizing that its half-decayed organs were all over my teeth, and then washing it down with a shot of tequila was a 5-second NIGHTMARE. I almost threw up my entire lunch. So why did I do it? The server picked up on the gray glow of my meal disappointment and hit me with a brilliant up-sell. \"You know what you should try that's pretty good?\" she said with a wink, \"The Scorpion Shot! Come on, you have to do it, you're in Vegas!\" She smiled pointing to a black t-shirt they sold with '#GOTSTUNG' printed on it.\n\n\"Awesome!\" was my innocent reply."

I called and asked if they could fax it and their fax machine was also not working.  They had someone deliver a menu to my office (they don't even deliver food).  That's a good start!  Or so I thought.\nNot sure if everyone is drunk when they review this place or what but the food was horrible.  No one in my office was satisfied with their food.  I ordered the Supreme Tostada Nacho and it ended up missing half of the things that are listed as being on it (fried jalapenos, avocado lime salsita, cilantro, etc).  It was some bland beef, bland fake cheese and a little real cheese on top of greasy chips.  Not sure how they can pride themselves on their nachos when I could get better ones from Taco Bell.   Another co-worker got steak street tacos - she said they were bland and nothing to write home about.  The wings were also not very tasty.  \nSo much for a new lunch spot downtown for us...."

We were also in the mood to have some margaritas so we figured perfect! We ordered our fiesta nachos and the nacho burger nachos or something like that, both of which were super yummy. We had a super nice server named Luis who gave us great service and sold us on not getting individual margaritas. He said we'd be better getting the pitchers cause we could get 4-5 margaritas each for less price so we were like done! Took 2 pitches between 5 of us. When he came out pouring the first pitcher it only filled up 4 of them just over half way. He had to use some of the second pitcher to fill ours more but then stopped half way through the second he realized we were clearly being shorted. He left with the still half pitcher and came back with it filled back up. In the end we all only had 1-1.5 drinks each. One of my friends asked for a manger and explained to him the situation and just felt like we were a little shorted and we were really nice about letting him know. Honestly we probably could've gone without even mentioning it and leaving barely satisfied with the situation but we decided let's just let him know. The first thing out of his mouth when we explained to him he said so you only had 1 1/2 drinks each? That's hard to believe. Ok no big deal. We just elaborated and he seriously did not care AT ALL about it. He was like well I sent you out a whole new pitcher and we were like well you took the half filled pitcher back first and just filled it with ice. After the shortest discussion ever he literally said ok well have a good night. I work in a customer service industry as a manager and it's our job to, even if there's not much we can do, to make sure the customer is happy. I'm not exactly sure how he was trained as manager or if customer service is of ANY important to Nacho Daddy but that was my first experience with the company and it's left a sour taste in all of our mouths because of it. The managers name was Rob apparently and I can't express the extent of how he just could not be bothered with us and in no way were we \"those\" kind of customers. We just wanted to let him know and he gave two shits about it. I don't know if any of us will come back, who knows. But total douche of a manager and that sucks cause other than our experience with him...everything wasn't too bad."

It sorta reminded me of the frozen mini shrimp you buy int he bag, and just defrost. \n\nThe grilled wings were actually good. They gave us the sauce on the side, so we could control how much we wanted. For grilled chicken wings, I think it was quite legit. 4.5 stars. \n\nI did love the layout and interior of the place, especially the draft beer section where you swipe a card and get a drink. I thought that would be fun with a group of people or even as a date. \n\nAs for the nachos, I haven't tried it, and I'm not sure if I really like their method of using cheese that is melted in a pot (like velveeta) versus the real shredded cheese that's on top of nachos. So, I guess one day, I may try it, but because I'm particular about my nachos.\n\nService was a 5 star. I loved our server, and he was super fun to talk to. I think that was the highlight of our meal besides the good food. \n\nI give this place a 3.25 stars for their food. Service brought it up to a 3.5."

We had chimichangas as an app, I had the huevos rancheros and my boyfriend had the Fiesta nachos. Everything was delicious. Both the nachos and my entr\u00e9e were generous portions. We each had a house Margherita and they were very good, and only 5$ each because it was happy hour. Our bill was just under 40$. Our server, Mikey, was great, very friendly and attentive. And he also honored our coupon even though they usually don't during happy hour. The atmosphere was very nice: they had 80s music videos that we were very entertained by but the music wasn't so loud where we had to yell to each other (think Yardhouse). I don't think it's fair that other reviews compare this to more authentic Mexican restaurants since I don't think it's the point of Nacho Daddy. Overall we really enjoyed it and will likely add this to our list of go-to places to eat."

It was plenty of food to fill up me and my husband and we left HAPPY!!! \nAnd...\nThey have a very extensive menu... not just nachos. Burgers, Chicken Wings, Vegan dishes... (the Daddy's Big Burrito caught my eye for my next visit for sure)"

I needed a drink on a patio and Nacho Daddy has Union Jack on tap and/or a free house Margarita with a Yelp check-in. I skipped on the margarita (saved the offer for later though) and opted to share a pitcher of beer with my party. Union Jack pints were $7 and pitchers were $25. \n\nIt was mostly about the atmosphere and alcohol so the only food I tried was the order of spicy shrimp nachos. It was good for what it was, bar food to soak up some of the alcohol. The service was great, our drinks were never empty. Not awesome but good enough to sit and sip on the patio. The beer selection does take it up a notch if you want something other than the usual tecate or modelo offered at most Mexican spots in Vegas."

Nacho Daddy is a novelty joint with the name \"Nacho Daddy\"- what is up with these negative reviews that are like \"the menu is primarily nachos, not a lot of variety\". Um, that's not a problem with the menu, the problem is you suck. \n\nThings I have had that are good\n\n-Cuban. I mean, not really an actual cuban, but a good sandwich nevertheless.\n-Wings- shockingly good. Really good blue cheese to boot\n-Queso- OMG WHITE QUESO I'M SO HAPPY\n-Burger Nachos- basically chips, cheese, and ground beef... so 10/10 would bang\n-Sliders- I didn't actually get to eat any of these as my dining companion killed them all. Looked good though.\n-Pork Tacos- I'm not ashamed to admit these were insanely good. Caramelized onions on top, some kind of delicious sauce, pretty pretty pretty good\n\nI have never actually been in there because I live 5 feet away and order it from postmates cause ballin, but I would assume the decor was subtle and sophisticated."

Our waiter was on point every second, even though it was very clear that he had just been slammed with 5 tables. It did not matter, he did not miss a beat! \n\nFood- Everything tasted really fresh, came quickly, all being delivered by friendly food runners. Was it mind shattering Mexican food? No, but it was all really good.\n\nMy biggest obstacle is the price point. All through my college years I survived on big delicious burritos because they were super cheap. So in my brain, I think Mexican food should be at least slightly inexpensive. \nWe ordered 1 appetizer - Queso Dip- It was good.\n3 entrees- 2 burritos and a plate of nachos.\n2 soft drinks, and a single beer.\nOur check with tip was $100! - OUCH!\nI could name 8 places in LV that would be as good and 1/2 that price.\n\nI would go back, if it was suggested.\nBut, honestly, I am not sure I would suggest it myself."

Now that there is one in my hood- in the old Firefly location on Sahara- a friend, who's been a longtime fan, suggested we grab a bite there. I loved the ambiance... still very Firefly'y, which I always found sort of... sexy? The hosts & our waiter were very friendly. My friend knew a shocking amount of Nacho Daddy fun facts, which was kind of fun & made me feel more connected to it. We ordered the elote (corn), Vegan \"steak\" nachos then went carnivorous with 3 mix & match tacos to try (chicken breast, filet & fish). Everything was delicious! My friend even gobbled down the whole filet taco... without saving me a bite... it was that yummy. The huge plate of vegan nachos were totally not weird. The \"steak\" had steak flavor & tender texture... we scarfed the whole plate but, because it was vegan, we didn't feel weighed down. Our favorite, though, was the fish taco... with a creamy dallop of cole slaw & mango salsa... it will likely be my summer go-to. I've already dined there a 2nd time, but at the Eastern location... I prefer the Sahara ambiance & staff more but the food was just as good. There was an awful man flipping out on our waitress & then to another staff member & I thought they handled it like champs. Certainly better than I was about to!"

When nachos are supposed to come with cheese and cheese sauce I should notice the cheese. There was very little cheese and none of the sauce. On top of that my nachos came with a surprise heap of black beans. I've never had black beans with Mexican food so this was a surprise, and unfortunately I do not like black beans. My daughter ordered the mac n cheese off of the kids menu. The bowl was not large, and was about a third full. I had to feed her again when we got home. It was probably about 5 ounces of mac n cheese, literally. I tried the nachos that my wife ordered, they were okay but also lacked cheese. I was hoping that this would be what I hoped for, but it isn't. We likely won't return. Also the prices were a little high."

I would hear stories of my friend who would praise Nacho Daddy on his side of town for hours on end.  I was so close to going the one Downtown, however I was recalled home prematurely by my significant other.\n\nThis time.  This time, it was DESTINY!   My friends and I counted the days to opening when we first saw it was coming to our side of town.  The the time came.  We sat, we ate, we got full.  We left happy.\n\nThis place was awesome.  Great ambiance.  Awesome Servers.  Insane menu!  The prices may be a tiny bit higher than what we usually spend, but totally worth it.\n\nI got the \"Fiesta Chicken Nachos\" with my now infamous custom order of Diet Cherry Coke.  \n\nBoth were spot on.  The Nachos were very tastey.  When they came, I didn't know how to attack it.  I accidently got a  little bit of cheese on my finger and when sucked my finger clean, it hit me!  My first bite of Nacho Daddys.  It was epic.\n\nThe Fiesta Chicken Nachos was very creamy, very rich (but not too rich) and there was definitely enough for me to take it home if I was sensible that day.  But I wasn't.  I DESTROYED the plate and it was glorious!\n\nI swear up and down that it tasted like I was hitting pockets of CHOCOLATE in my nachos.  As crazy as that sounds and as gross as the prospect may be, it was good!\n\nOur server was astute and prompt.  For being open for only a few days when we visited, the place was well put together and on the ball.  \n\nI highly recommend this place.\n\n- Clean\n- Spacious\n- Music Videos playing, Sports playing, TVs everywhere."

How in the world do they have ice cream for that but not for deep fried ice cream? How does that make since. Food for 3 kids, (I did not order anything seeing how expensive it was for the quality of food) I just ordered food for my kids and for 2 kids meals and 1 thing of nachos and 1 desert was $60!!

Nacho cheese sauce?  Really?  Too bad I don't drink, because if I was drunk, I might have given another star.  Really disappointed."

Not something you want to hear when you are greeted.\nWe sat down about 10 minutes later and ordered immediately. The server was nice but he never really checked up on us. He was focused on 2 other tables that were a bit larger. We had to flag him down for water and condiments. It was hard enough to just get his attention with music blasting. \nThe food was between del Taco and Robertos.  That's the only honest description I can think of. I opted for the queso dip and chips and quesadilla. My husband ordered the burrito, which was huge, but nothing phenomenal. The queso dip was made out of real cheese, but that was the only dish that stood out. The kids had nachos and Mac and cheese, so, that too was mediocre. \nI don't think I will come back here anytime soon, maybe for the happy hour. Maybe I will update my review then."

            "review": "Located in the former Firefly restaurant this place offers a bit more than nachos. We arrived during happy hour and i must admit their house margarita is amazing! I wish they offered a smaller portion of their nachos during happy hour sometimes you dont want a massive mound of food at $10.95 a plate. I ordered the bbq chix nachos which my friend warned me not to order because they are a bit robust. They arrived and she was not wrong - there was too much going on on the plate. The bbq sauce was overpowering and salty, the cheese sauce got lost under everything and just coated your mouth, the onion strings were salty and the chicken was salty. I suppose it came out as it should have but i make these at home minus onion strings and never get this kind of intense flavor. I wouldn't order them again. My friend ordered the hamburger nachos which were an odd flavor combination but good. My other friend ordered the fish and chips which tasted of old smelly fish. We blame him for ordering that in a restaurant that serves nachos, but not sure why thats even on the menu. \n\nThe service was great, quick and friendly. They have a pretty varied menu to choose from if youre not a fan of nachos. I love nachos but will stick to my real Mexican restaurants to satisfy my appetite."

We went in and were immediately seated, we arrived there around 6:30PM. We were treated by our waiter, Shawn, who served our drinks quickly. My table and I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos for an appetizer and they were amazing! The size was large and honestly I would have eaten it as an entree. We ordered our entrees and I got the camp fire burger (not exactly that name, but around those words) with a medium rare meat and garlic parmesan fries. The meat of the burger was so juicy and the buns were toasted to perfection. The fries were made to perfection, all of the fries were crispy and they didn't lose their crunch through the entire meal. But the fries were just a little too oily but still tastes amazing. Overall, I would say A++ for the food and service. Thanks to our waiter for the amazing suggestion and service. \nThe environment was nice. I liked that they had late 90s music playing in the background with the music video playing along. They also had sports games on tv like baseball, cross fit, and football. So A+ on the environment. \n\nSo I went here two days after (July 26) and the service here was bad. But I don't completely blame the waiters. There was probably 3 waiters serving the entire restaurant which made our food service slow. I do not know exactly how long we were waiting here for our food but it was probably 30-45 minutes. This place has its good and bad days. Let's hope that if you do go here, you get here on a good day."

They seemed to try to hurry us out and brought the bill quickly. Our bill for two people was over 40 bucks and we didn't have any drinks. I left hungry. The food server and hosts were very friendly and the salsa is good. That's about it. \n\nIf you want a better Mexican restaurant go to Lindo Michoacan, Juan's Flaming Fajitas or even Ricardo's."

All three were great, but the prices were a little tough to swallow (pun intended). Don't get me wrong, the margarita was very well done, and the spicy shrimp nachos were excellent as well. The $15 dollar price tag wasn't worth the portion size. Our bill came to $45 or so after taxes, and I just didn't think it warranted what we ordered. \n\nWe'll be back again in the future, but I don't think we'll make this a regular stop. I think a price adjustment in the future is probably warranted (I think they've only been open for a week or so) and if so I think we'd come more often.\n\nAt the end of the day it's worth a look, and they have a pretty extensive tequila list that might be fun."

Although it wasn't busy, we were promptly greeted and seated. Deb was our server and was extremely knowledgeable on the menu and drinks. We started with the 6pc wings. Deb was right! They didn't need any sauce!! Soo good! Then we split the Shrimp fajitas. They came out still sizzling and were absolutely perfect!\nOur drinks were never empty and didn't have to ask for anything we needed. This by far is some of the best food and service we have received in Vegas. We will defiantly be back to try more food, happy hour and the live trivia during the week!!"

But our Server was a CHAMP and made the whole experience AWESOME! \nNot to say the food was bad, it was just Meh... But the confusing part was, 2 burritos, 1 nacho plate and 2 beers and it was like $100. That seemed kinda high. And although it seemed kinda high, we still had a GREAT time! Most people won't let Management know about great service, however on our way out, I made sure I let the MOD know what a great Server we had and what a great time we had because of him!"

But that's not the reason I wouldn't come back. The service was HORRIBLE. The manager couldn't have been there that night. Plates were being broken in the kitchen. The staff was laughing. A male server picked up a female server and just horse playing the whole time we were there. They got our order wrong and took forever to give us back the check. We felt that if we just left, no one would have even noticed. It was like the staff were at a frat party. I'd never go back there, it was awful."

We had the Thai chicken nachos (could've been warmer, but delicious), Mexican corn on the cob, & some carne asada & chicken street tacos. We sat at a high table in the bar. The restaurant was practically empty when we got there, but was full when we left at 6:45. We were immediately seated & served our drinks. I had a skinny margarita & he had the house/happy hour wine. I ordered mine without salt, it came with salt on it, but no big deal. I drank it that way. We had to ask for happy hour menus as they were not on the table. My husband didn't think the house Cabernet was very good so he switched to margaritas as well. Overall, we both said we'd go back. It's a unique menu. The cheese sauce on the nachos is a bit processed tasting, but not overwhelmingly so. Everything we ordered was good & it was a lot of food. We split all of it. I had two margaritas, he had two margaritas & a glass of wine. Our bill was $65.00."

You see it at times at a buffet when the food has been sitting out all day.. That's what it looked like. \n3. This is what my bf calls this place: it's kinda harsh though... It's a wanna be Mexican restaurant.

These are classic, hilarious and often mind boggling music videos from the 80's.  Remember when Eddie Murphy was singing about his party girl?  \n\nThe staff is very accommodating.  My friends and I sit at the bar which is usually not over-crowded.  The bartenders are attentive, friendly and knowledgable about mixed concoctions and tequila.  Yes, they offer a shot with a scorpion in it.  Be brave!  \n\nOn Weds night, they hold trivia night.  The questions are tough.  My friends and I are Public Ivy grads and we usually come in close to last lol.  Put your team together and if you win, I think the prize is a 50$ gift card (not sure since we've never won lol.)  It's a lot of fun and a great way to meet people!\n\nNot sure why this place isn't busier with the creative food, great service, entertainment and reasonable prices.  \n\nEnjoy!"

Until we sat down at the bar , young guy in charge of changing Channels was very rude to my wife and we kept on getting the run around .. Very bad first impression we will not be returning very bad for this place because we always bring a big crowd .. So we went down the street to pkway tavern and got excellent service ..

Rice and beans on one side, meat on other side of it. It would fall apart when you cut into it. Atmosphere would have been perfect if it hadn't been for the odd shows they had on the TV screens. One was a turtle eyeball being surgically worked on and the other was a show of idiots performing painful stunts and making fools of themselves. Definitely not what I wanted to watch while I ate.

(I figured Summerlin location would be just as fun as downtown). I tried to make reservations for our larger party in advance twice, each time my phone number was taken and they said a manager would call me, which did not ever happen. I finally called again a few days before our planned outing and just made a regular reservation, no manager approval needed. I realized it's probably a lot more casual than I was picturing.\n\nAfter we got there the servers and hostess were super nice and accommodating however the food itself was not great (I'd rather eat nachos from Robertos or KoMex) and I am not sure if it is because of where we were sitting or the fact there were other large parties there, but half my party ordered extras (like sour cream or guacamole) and it didn't come until the end of the meal, after they had eaten most or all of their food.\n\nThe name Nacho Daddy is cute and the thought behind the food and menu was better than the food itself.  The prices were reasonable (my bill was half of what I had budgeted on spending on our party) but I do not plan on returning there again.  After hearing feedback from my staff in the office the next week their sentiments were the same."

I ordered both with garlic parmesan fries one of the sides that comes with the sandwiches.  I was told 15 minutes and that was about exactly right although I was thjere early because they're so close to where I live.\n\nMy wife enjoyed the Mexican burger and the fries very much.  My sandwich was good but it's not a Cuban sandwich.  It's pulled pork and a slice of ham with some cheese on a toasted baguette and not a pressed sandwich as every authentic Cuban sandwich should be.  I liked the fries.\n\nThe packing for take out was good.  It was firm plastic but on the cold day we had, it wasn't the best insulator.  It wasn't a good day for takeout for most places with the cold.\n\nThe sandwiches were OK but nothing I'd get again.  Pricey for what you get.  Too many good places around."

We finally decided to try...unfortunately on a night that featured the wild card round of football.\n\nWe waited nearly 30 minutes for a drink order so we quickly placed our order in case we got lost in the shuffle. When our drinks arrived, they were without straws. Upon asking we were told, \" oh sorry, I'll get you some.\"  The appetizer arrived right on queue, which we were to find out would be the highlight of our meal.\n\nOur meal arrived in two parts, four plates for everyone else...mine 10 minutes later after having to ask for it. While I don't claim to be a connoisseur or any kind of food critic per se, their food was bland, partly cold, and the tacos brought back memories of being at taco bell after a long night out with the guys. Refills on drinks arrived before we got straws, but hey they're trying, right?\n\nNow mind you, I understand that it was a busy night with the game on, perhaps a little understaffed because they were unsure what the crowd might be like, and there was a reserved party in the next room. However, some things can be excused and overlooked, others...not so much.\n\nSave your pallet the trip. The food is a notch above Del Taco or Taco Bell, the benefit here being at least you can have some alcohol to kill some of the taste. The staff was friendly, but very tunnel-visioned with their duties. The poor gal waiting on us already had a complaint from a neighboring table so we graciously ate our food and left, no sense adding more fuel to that burning fire.\n\nMy piece of advise, skip this place until they can get their act together. Sorry honey, this place is a bust."

Food was consistently good most likely because all recipes are made in their commissary kitchen.  We came during a late lunch so there was no one in the restaurant.  Food came out in minutes since we were the only ones in the dining area.   Our Nachos were delicious, the chicken tenders for the kids  did not look as fresh.  The chicken strips were an odd shape with a unique processed taste.  \n\nI will always be a fan of Nacho Daddy I think it is a great concept.  One of my favorite features about the Summerlin location is the self serve craft beer area.  You can purchase a gift type cardin $20 increments and draft your own glass of beer.  They have many great selections of local and regional brews available.  Insert you card and pull the lever and your credits will be deducted form your card.  WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT??!!! Great Idea give it a try.  I have seen a similar setup in wine dispensing before."

We immediately ordered the Mexican Corn and the Spicy Shrimp Nachos. The corn was okay. Definitely over cooked or had been cooked and sitting out a while. The nachos were horrid. For $17 you get maybe 4-5 medium shimp cut up into smaller pieces. The chips were SO greasy!!!! For $17 I was expecting more. The worst part is that I've been up since 3am with food poisoning from the under cooked shrimp. I should have known by looking at them. \n\nThe staff is the only reason I gave two stars. Attentive and genuine.  I so badly wished the food was better. I'll gladly go elsewhere, pay half that price and get 5 star nachos."

            "review": "We ate at this new restaurant yesterday - Saturday - about 2:00 pm.  \n\nSO MANY reasons why we will never go back there.\n\n1 - With a name like Nacho Daddy, I would expect that the place would offer a lot more with respect to Nachos - build your own, nacho bar, etc.  This restaurant had none of that - at least we didn't see it.  Our group did order one order of nachos - enchilada style - YUCK - so little melted cheese - you could barely see it.   Not great.  \nSent back to kitchen to add a few beans and it took almost 20 minutes - the table was done eating by the time the order came - note:  the restaurant had less than 50 people in it...\n\n2 - Being a new restaurant in this area, they should be better.  Surely there was a manager on duty - but not once did he/she ever walk around and check each table to see how the meal/experience was going...\n\n3 - The chips and salsa and guac ($10) was good - but we will not be back ever.\n\n4 - One person in our party ordered a bowl with beans/chicken - it was delivered on a black rectangular plate- HORRIBLE presentation - very unappetizing.  Although the chicken had good flavor.  For the $, it was not much food though.  How much do black beans/rick really cost you, Nacho Daddy?  Don't mind you making a profit, but you do need to reevaluate your menu pricing.  A little out of line - you have to compete with Chipotle and Cafe Rio just a block away - yes, they are fast casual and Nacho Daddy is not - but families that don't care about drinking a margarita or beer will not be interested in your restaurant more than once, based on your current menu.\n\n5 - 3 people ordered a meal/iced tea and 2 had only chips/guac/salsa/tea -- our bill was $70 (before tip without bar drinks).  For lunch, that is ridiculous.  \n\nWe will go down the street another block and go to Cafe Rio - it's fast casual, but quality food and fresh ingredients - and the entire meal for us would have been closer to $35...\n\nI'm placing my bet now - Nacho Daddy's will never make it at this location."

Our server Johnny was excellent. attentive, friendly and fast. The food was very good and the selection of Tequila is extensive.  It was also Taco Tuesday which gets 2 for 1 Tequila. Woo Hoo.  My only negative comment is the staff is not well versed in Tequilas. ND should train/educate all employees about Tequila. \nWith that being said we look forward to returning soon to the New Nacho Daddy's in Summerlin for another fun evening"

My first impression was that this place looked more like a sports bar than your typical Mexican restaurant, with TV's, a craft beer bar, and a large bar area.\n\nThe trivia was surprisingly fair and winnable, and there were about 8 teams so it came down to the wire.  The beer selection was very solid, at price points of about ($6-$8).  They also implemented a new craft beer bar where they put local or rarer rotating craft taps on the wall (about 6) and you buy a card and pour yourself some beer on your own.  I absolutely love this concept because I usually get flights to try new varieties.  It did not say what they charge per oz, but I would assume it would come out to about $7 for 12oz.\n\nThe person I came with had the burger, which he said was pretty good.  And the fajitas smelled amazing when they passed by.  I have also heard stellar reviews about their margaritas and their scorpion shots (not sure this location does though, however).\n\nFinally, I had a coupon which they honored no problem.  This place is worth a try, especially on a wednesday since there's good trivia.  But I could even be back here to watch some sports in the future because the atmosphere and beer selection is quite nice for a Mexican restaurant."

Both greeters started arguing about who's fault it was.  After being stated the waiter took our orders but no drinks and no refills afterwards.  My nachos were very good, my wife's fajita salad was drenched in vinegar (drenched).   It is worth trying once, but due to poor service and not so good food  we won't go back.  \n\nAfter writing this review I had a message from Nacho Daddy management offering to review my experience with their restaurant.    As a consumer it is refreshing to see that they do listen and want to make an effort to provide a quality experience.  Thank you Nacho Daddy"

He was attentive, funny and friendly.  Our drinks were never dry and it was done with a smile.  \n\nKeeping with the known, we tried what we would usually order ~ Supreme Tostada Nachos as well as the Fajita Cheese Steak Sandwich.  The nachos were piled high with ingredients of meat, cheese, tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os sour cream and guacamole.  Chips were crisp and warm.  Delicious.  Our sandwich met the standards of the table.  Filled wonderfully with steak, onions peppers and quest.  Great sandwich indeed!\n\nBonus~ There is a free house margarita with Yelp check in.  Just a cherry on top of our fun visit here.

The chips are nice and thin and fresh, the cheese was melted, not a cheese sauce, and there was just a little bit of heat.  I also liked the smokey flavor that I think came from the meat.  These nachos are easily big enough to share.  The margarita was amazing. It didn't taste like a margarita from a gross bar. It tasted fresh and fruity and the flavors were balanced. \n\nI also had the flan, which was great. It was a little firmer than I am used to, but really great. \n\nI sat at the bar and enjoyed the videos from my high school days and the friendly service from Tyson (Tyler?) and the other bartender, who was fantastic."

The plates looked bare and my boys finished the fries in a matter of minutes. The fiesta chicken nachos were really good and came topped with refried beans, salsa, queso fresco, sour cream, and guacamole. My favorite were the spicy shrimp nachos, although, they don't really live up to their name since they only have a small kick. The tortilla chips are jalapeno chips, they're topped off with monterey jack cheese, jalapenos, diablo sauce, tomatoes, and cilantro. Everything was very delicious and our meal with drinks came out to a little over $50, so it was inexpensive for 4 of us to dine in. \n\nFood was good, atmosphere was pleasant, our server was on top of everything, we never had to wait on refills and she constantly checked up on us so excellent service on her behalf."

I stood at the host stand for 10 min without any one approaching me and my boyfriend.

Now, I'm not sure what happened in that half hour or so but the coupon was gone by the time we got the check. I'm pretty sure the waitress took the coupon when we showed it to her, but either way she wouldn't give it to us. I would have liked to speak with a manager but I was too distracted by the table behind us. They asked to move seats and their waiter seemed really annoyed with their request. I saw him roll his eyes when he turned away and he was swearing the whole time under his breath. Really vulgar things. I was honestly shocked. Obviously the table being served couldn't hear him but I could. \nVerdict: good food, but not so family-friendly language and rude servers.

I had gringos tacos 1 chicken and 1 beef they were pretty good the only thing I didn't like was that they use cheese queso instead of shredded cheese. It sucks that chips and salsa are extra we are used to eating at Juans flaming fajitas and chips and salsa are included not to mention soup is also included. I don't eat beans so I did not have them I only had the rice and it left a lot to be desired I had to cover it in salsa. The rest of the menu looks pretty decent so I'm sure we'll be back to try it again."

I am not a fan of Mexican food and had frequented the Firefly that was previously here so I was not quite sure to expect. \n\nThey have a decent happy hour menu - $5 dollar house margaritas (and they didn't skimp on booze). I was happy with the food on the happy hour menu as it wasn't all carbs. I had the ceviche and I have no complaints. The grilled corn tempted me too.\n\nI don't really have anything negative to say. Perhaps they could have free chips and salsa? (I was always a fan of the bread/weird butter at Firefly)\n\nI would go back.. and I know my friends definitely will (they live much closer)."

They should just include it, like most Mexican restaurants. Anyways, the salsa was ok, a little bland, I had to add some salt for flavor. We got the mild and medium salsa, pretty much neither were spicy, which was ok by me. I ordered the cheeseburger nachos as my main. Once again, they were a little bland. The ground beef did not have too much flavor. I would say they were just ok. My brother ordered the spicy shrimp nachos, he said they were not spicy at all. I tasted them, kinda bland. All in all the food needs more flavor here. We shared a fried ice cream for dessert and that was pretty good, but I think it was like $9, glad we didn't get two at that price. Oh yeah and when you eat the salsa here, prepare for your breath to smell like garlic for the whole 24 hours after, even with mouthwash and good brushing, lol."

The servers are all so kind and cheery. I have an IndiCard so I use it whenever I go for the sweet discount (don't worry, the amount we save is usually what goes to the server for their tip - for example, our bill tonight for 2 sodas, Burger Nachos, Tostada Nachos, and a fried ice cream was only $21 with the IndiCard hookup, so we tipped $20. Win-win, right?)\n\nWe want to come back on a Wednesday for the Trivia Night with our friends soon. :) Thank you, Nacho Daddy!"

As far as service goes it was very good and our waitress checked on us frequently. With that few tables it would have been a shame if it wasn't.  I tried two of the margaritas, the blackberry and the mango.  I preferred the blackberry maybe because it was a little sweeter.  The mango was just okay to me but I wouldn't order it again. Shared the Filet Mignon Nachos and they were delicious.  My pet peeve with the Downtown location was the chips were not even warm and here they were perfect!  Before we had decided on the Filet Mignon Nachos the waitress was helpful in letting us know what was popular and warned us about a spicy selection we almost made that would have had my BF sweating in his seat.  The Yelp check in offer was a free margarita and it's full size so that was nice. I've been to other places where a check in drink offer is half the size of the regular."

Nick offers no adjustment on our bill nor anything else to make us think the place cares about making the customer happy. I tell him I plan to tell everyone I know not to go here, but I think others have beaten me to it since it was pretty empty for a Friday night. The food is unremarkable, forgettable, and overpriced.

This place opens at 8:00 daily and for a good reason. On weekends they offer never ending mimosas and a make yourself Bloody Mary bar (never ending as well). Most breakfast spots have ridiculous waits on weekends. This place wasn't crowded and the food is amazing. \nThe menu has so many things I want to try. Definitely have to come back for other things. They have a 80oz El Jimador margarita table top dispenser for $45 too! So many unique things. Come enjoy Nacho Daddy!!\nJulie was a great server too!!"

Cons - seated next to the shrieking eels of, \"of my god, we're like totally awesome\".  My ears are ringing and bleeding. I may die of this internal injury in my sleep and those screeching college drop outs will get away with killing me. \n\nAny who, the kids meals were so very lackluster.  The chicken tenders and fries both had an essence of aquarium rot. The mac n cheese was ok, the kids nachos came out both cold and soggy.   (Nice way to watch the goods, servers).  My chicken chimichanga was crunchy on the outside,  and a tongue scalding inferno of mostly beans on the inside.   Not much to write home about. \n\nWell, then there was the dessert.  Churro sundae...this part they got right. I think the sound waves from the incessant shouting out of the early twenties cat ladies actually made the ice cream melt a little. \n\nSo,  after we practically swallowed the sundae whole, we waited for the check.   I couldn't shout over the stadium of three nor could I make visual contact with Ru Paul, I mean, our waiter.  After ten minutes,  and my son remarking on the steady slew of profanities from the fourth string cheer squad, the waiter magically appears,  check in hand, at their table. If I could have done it, I would've chucked my leftover bean log at him to get his attention. We literally sat for several more minutes and watched the trio jump in a fourth member by making him out-shriek and out-squeal them all,  combined. Two more minutes of feeling my ear drums expand to near bursting,  I got up from my table to leave, no check,  just leave.  Finally, the guy from Cats, off Broadway, of course, addressed me as I was going up the ramp,  with my kids.   I showed him my mean face and he said,  I have your check right here.  \"Well, thanks, glitter balls!  About effing time...\" is what I wanted to say,  but,  instead,  I thanked him for the delicious sundae, while he intermittently gave me his bitch face (and kept turning to look at his new girlfriends).  I will never be back. \n\nFYI -  the super loud femmes were already eating their giant freaking nacho piles when we arrived, so, I never imagined those potential DUIs were going to sit and drink and scream at each other for another 45 minutes.  This may be my last review ever....unless I don't succumb to the ear injury."

We all had drinks in a very short period of time.  The menu is pretty long - there is definitely plenty to choose from.  What I particularly like are the variations on standard Mexican dishes.  For instance, they have Thai chicken nachos and filet mignon nachos.  One of my friends sticks to a more vegetarian/vegan diet and this is the only Mexican place I have ever seen that has vegan options. \n\nI split the Supreme Tostada Nachos with a friend.  The food was delicious.  The nachos came out as a decent sized plate, more than enough to split if you're averagely hungry.  \n\nThe interior looks like it can be split in two, with sliding panels on top of a half wall so that it can split up the bar and the dining area.  I imagine this makes it better for families and helps keep the place a bit quieter.  \n\nI'd definitely be happy to come back here."

Last night we decided to try dinner time, and the atmosphere was totally different but still awesome. Wednesday nights are trivia night, and although we didn't participate this time, we sure will next. If you go for trivia plan on spending 2 hours or so there - that's what the dude told me it takes on average. There were lots of people playing and it was crazy fun just to be around. Busy nights and lazy afternoons - nacho daddy is good anytime of day. I heard they have brunch, I can't wait to try it. \n\nAnyways, last night I got nacho average hamburger nachos and they were awesome. They were exactly like a supped up version of Taco Bell nachos bell grande. If you are stoned or are crazy nacho cheese sauce: get this. It is the caviar of stoner food, I swear. I normally get the filet mignon nachos or the fiesta nachos when I go, which are also both AMAZING. I also tried the fried ice cream - super good. My SO has always liked his food too, but unfortunately I don't remember what he got as I was too immersed in mine. Just know he liked it as well. \n\nAs far as service goes, I have always liked our waiters every time we go. However last night a guy named Alex (I think?) served us and he was hardcore working it. At one point I'm pretty sure I saw him running. Running through the place like James Bond just to make sure people get everything on time. That is a wild amount of  dedication to customer service. \n\nI would give this place six stars if I could just because of waiter dedication. Nacho Daddy is hardworking, full of awesome food, and fun and I appreciate it."

            "review": "I can give it a good 3 1/2 stars!\n\nTruth be told, we visited Nacho Daddy off the basis of a Groupon.  Without it, I was teetering on the fence about visiting here.  Mainly because even though I love me some nachos, I usually have no problem making it at home (and I do make a pretty mean one).  But in the end I saw some flavors on the Nacho Daddy menu that were intriguing.  It's not hard to make me happy when it comes to nachos, I mean I even like the ones at the local 7-11!  \n\nThe fam and I went on a weekend for lunch and was a bit surprised the place was fairly empty.  There was football on the TV!  Nachos!  Beer!  Women in tight tops!  Would have thought Nacho Daddy would have been more filled in for a sports day.  There were only like 6 - 8 tables taken when we got there, and a fairly empty bar area.\n\nWe were seated promptly at a nice corner table near the windows.  Our server was very personable and fairly quick.  Looking at the menu we all decided to get two nacho entrees to share and a salad to go along with it.  We decided on:\n\n*Nacho Average Burger Nachos ($10.95) - seasoned ground beef, applewood smoked bacon, yellow queso sauce, red onions, tomatoes & shredded lettuce over house made corn chips\n\n*Florentine Nachos ($11.95) - grilled chicken breast, sun dried tomatoes, bacon, spinach, topped with Asiago, Romano & Parmesan cheese sauce, all over spinach corn chips\n\n*Kale Salad ($6.95 & a Nacho Daddy favorite) - kale with cucumber, corn, grape tomatoes, mushrooms, red onions & avocado with an agave citrus vinaigrette\n\nYou might think that with the advert of house made chips at Nacho Daddy you would get a complimentary bowl of them along with some house salsa at each table.  Isn't the chip supposed to be your strong point?  Why not a sample?  But not the case here.  If you want it, Bottomless Chips & Salsa are offered at $2.95 for every 4 guests.  Not a big deal, but it did kinda bother me a bit.  Oh well, price of doing business I suppose.\n\nDidn't take too long for our orders to come out, maybe around 20 minutes.  All looked pretty fresh!  \n\nNacho Average Burger Nachos were good.  Basically like a cheeseburger on a nacho!  While delicious, I didn't think this was really something I couldn't attempt to make at home.  Chips were crunchy, with a fair amount of toppings on top.  But I could have done with more cheese on them, maybe a healthy layer of shredded cheese in the middle of the chip stack BEFORE adding the queso sauce and toppings?  I had a few spots there where my chip didn't get any cheese on them.\n\nThe Florentine Nachos were pretty to look at with all the Italian colors of red, white & green.  Thankfully they were tasty as well.  Grilled chicken wasn't dry, and the sun dried tomatoes and bacon added some good contrasting texture.  The white cheese sauce was yummy, but again there wasn't quite enough to go around!  Some of the spinach chips ended up being bare in spots!  \n\nSurprisingly, the best thing we had on the table was the Kale Salad!  I would go back to Nacho Daddy just for this!  Possibly make it a meal next time with the addition of a grilled chicken breast on top!  This salad was downright great, even though the rest of my fam didn't like the red onion on it.  I think the vinaigrette is what made their kale salad really good.  It was sweet, sour & tangy, a good mix with the hearty kale & meaty avocado.  I just wish this sucker were bigger!  \n\nThe manager of Nacho Daddy came to our table towards the end of our meal and asked us how we were doing & if the food was to our liking.  I politely made a small comment about the cheese placement and he told me they would definitely look into making a change on that.  He also suggested on the next visit to try the Thai Chicken Nachos, his current favorite.  Pleasant guy, thanked us for coming in.\n\nOverall Nacho Daddy is going in a good direction for a niche/theme restaurant.  The nachos were tasty but needs some work with getting more cheese in those nooks & crannies.  Also, maybe up the serving a tad?  When I think nachos I think a big pile of chips smothered in goodies.  Adding another little layer of chips would up the wow factor for these guys and add value to their pricing.  I wish the salad were a bit larger as well, but it was enough for three of us to share in smaller servings.\n\nI'd come back again to Nacho Daddy if I had another Groupon handy.  I'm not sure if I'd be back right away without one though, there's just so many other places to dine if you're spending that kind of money.  However, their nacho combinations are hard to beat.\n\nNacho ordinary joint!"

But then we waited 15 minutes and left... no one came up to greet us or ask for drinks or anything !. The sad thing is the place wasnt even busy . Sorry but if you cant say anything withing 15 minutes of me seating at a table that means you offer bad service.  I will never give them another chance . Good luck with staying open."

Almost to the end of the meal a hair was found in the food. This was a short dark hair. I don't know if this has happened to anyone before but you he this nauseated feeling in your stomach and you appetite is ruined. I had no problem telling the waitress and she told the manager. This is the problem I have, the manager didn't come out and apologize she sent the waitress back out who said  the manager took the entree off your bill and the chips and salsa. And then she said sometimes these things happen. \n\nExcuse me sometimes these things happen you don't tell a customer that EVER. She was making it sound like it was ok and it's not ok . That's disgusting unsanitary who the hell is in the kitchen and why aren't they wearing a hair net because it wasn't long enough to pull back . I'm pretty sure we won't be back"

We were seated quickly, which was great, but then no one asked us if we wanted drinks or a kid's menu for our little one. So we sat for awhile patiently and then a server came over and we asked to please bring those things over for us. We ordered our appetizer (queso dip - by recommendation from a friend who had been a patron at a different location). The server asked if we wanted salsa with it and I said that I did. When we received it, no salsa was with it and the queso was pretty lackluster. It was a very pale yellow color and it paled in taste as well. It was just sort of bland, like I've had better grocery store queso. From a place called Nacho Daddy, we expected more/better.\n\nWe ordered from the kid's menu for our son (macaroni and cheese) and asked for it to be brought out before our food (parents out there know why). They brought it out and my husband couldn't even cut through the noodle, it was so hard and so chewy. We had to send it back because it wasn't edible. The server came back and said the manager apologizes and that he agreed it was hard and they will make us a new one. They fixed it and brought it back and it was clearly much better, so I don't know what happened the first time.\n\nThen the nachos that i ordered came (filet mignon nachos) and I was fully expecting a nacho place to get it right. Wrong. The nachos weren't at all layered, so once you pull off 1 or 2 chips that are loaded with the toppings, everything underneath is just chip. You'd think they'd know better!\n\nI ended up not eating much more than 10 chips fully loaded before I was all done. We saw the s'mores dessert on the Yelp check-in that I did while I was there and we thought it looked amazing and wanted to give it a try. Let me just tell you...it was really good, but it's huge. I recommend 4 ppl sharing that bad boy. Seriously though, best part of the whole dinner right there. Only problem was it was so big and that sort of dish isn't edible later, so we had to leave a big portion untouched.\n\nMy husband got a sandwich and he said it was great. So maybe they should change their name or their business model. Nacho Jr. would be better due to the clear miseducation on nacho best practices!\n\nWhen all was said and done, we left with a $75.00 bill (yikes!) and they STILL charged us $1 for a side of ranch even though they had a lot of missteps themselves (including not ever mentioning that a side of ranch was $1...first we learned was when we saw the bill). \n\nWon't be back unless it's new management/chef. Really disappointing experience overall."

We tried the sloppy Jose, bbq, Nacho average burger, supreme tostada, shrimp, and filet mignon nachos. They were all delicious. My favorite were the BBQ.

Would advise against ordering them for takeout though.\n\nWeird communication issues when picking up my order, combined with an odd choice of takeout packaging- chips, cheese, and protein are boxed in cardboard similar to pizza carryout. Additional toppings are packed separately in Styrofoam and plastic cups. Initially I was put off by this but it grew on me- could add the sour cream, guac, and beans to my preferred level. Portion did not seem adversely affected by the box used.\n\nFlavors though? Tasty. Chicken and encihlada sauce was well seasoned but not spicy, large rings of jalapenos made it easy to eat around them if you want, portion was large enough to share- maybe add on some tacos and this is easily dinner for two. \n\nBonus star for having queso on the menu- one of the few places in town to do so, and one of the major things I miss from home! ."

Sweet!\n\nWe were greeted and seated immediately by a hostess. Our awesome server Nick took care of us, including making sure my food had no tomatoes. This is really important for me, as I have a food sensitivity to raw tomatoes. I had the chicken fajitas, which were delicious and not greasy at all. Loved the addition of scallions. The rice was tasty; refried beans actually tasted of kidney beans for a change. Mom's vegetarian burrito with a veggie patty, black beans, rice and lots of vegetables was also amazing and proved too much for my mom to finish. As a vegetarian, she was impressed that thought had been given to making a great-tasting dish that wasn't an afterthought.\n\nBeer for me and wine for mom -- good selection for both. There's a tasting option for craft ales at 60\u00a2/oz on a $10 prepay tab, but it was more beer than I could handle!\n\nI'll be back next time I'm in the area. Nothing to fault, and a lot to like."

My excuse was I'm eating for 2! ;) Unfortunately, I was not able to try the cocktails because I'm 41/2 months pregnant but I got to witness my boss and a couple of coworkers do the Scorpion shot and that right there was a memorable evening.. It was a great experience and the service was so incredible I would definitely recommend this location. Thank you so much Debra for your wonderful hospitality and you will be seeing us again soon!"

The bottomless chips and salsa. Everything was pretty blah from there.\n\nI got the Tostada nacho appetizer for dinner. The seasoning on the meat was like...they tried to do Mexican flavors but got confused or were missing the right spices and used something else. It was just weird. And I totally appreciate super loaded nachos... these were just too much. \n\nMy husband got the buffalo chicken nachos and got approximately 3 tiny pieces of buffalo chicken on them. \n\nThank god for the bottomless chips and salsa or we probably would've gone hungry. \n\nOur server was great and had an awesome sense of humor, so that helped. I'm glad we went and tried it out, but I don't think we'll be going back."

Nacho daddy does exactly what they advertise: nachos. I wouldnt get much else, if anything, off the menu but nachos and drinks. Be careful during sporting events or happy hour, they can be a bit crazed and ticket times can run long, but all in all good time isn't your severs fault, and they are trying as hard as they can.

They serve a Combination of American and Mexican food dishes, with emphasis placed on their unique selection of nacho dishes.\n\nI tried them for the first time today and I probably should have stuck to the nachos the namesake suggests. I ended up getting the grilled cheese sandwich (stuffed with roasted Anaheim chilis, two cheeses, and applewood smoked bacon), because it sounded different and awesome. It was good, but nothing to celebrate, or probably even order again. The bread was a little too buttery tasting and there wasn't as much cheese as I'd expect from a grilled cheese. Bacon was good, but thin. I've gotta applaud the creativity, though.. This sandwich had so many things I like cramped into one package.\n\nMy wife went with a sandwich as well and got the cheese steak. It was actually quite small, and I didn't see any cheese on it at all. The beef was flavorful, but the bread also had that weird buttery taste. I like butter, but I'm pretty sure this was some kind of soybean oil based imitation. \n\nOverall, both sandwiches were good, and the sweet potato and garlic Parmesan fries we ordered were great.\n\nI think next time I'll definitely be trying out their nachos, however, because the pictures and descriptions looked really good, and the food I did have just wasn't good enough to bring me back on its own.\n\nWe liked the bottomless chips and salsa. Chips were excellent but the salsas were average. Medium was pretty good, but the hot salsa made me laugh. It was just the same medium salsa with a handful of pickled jalape\u00f1os sprinkled on top.\n\nThe beer selection was pretty stellar, so if I'm ever looking for a place with great brews and appetizers, this is definitely a top choice on my list!"

I've everything from the Nachos to the enchiladas and it just wasn't for me.  It's a hair pricier.  Not terribly, but a hair.

I usually wait till I try a place a few times before going star crazy but as stated I have things I need to say.. The reason they get two stars instead of zero and a escalation  is  when I called to ask wait times and when we were seated both the female who answered and the gentleman who seated us both who sadly I didn't get their names were friendly and informed...\nFood  quality and booze was good even if my experience was not .. so let's get on with this yelp rage review from another one of those hangry yelpers shall we? \n\n\nSo driving down Sahara on our way to Indian Friday night we drove past nacho daddy and I recalled I tried them out originally at a yelp event and fell hard for their Mexican corn offthe cob so of course I decided before my movie date Saturday it was time for margaritas and some Mexican nachos .. Fast fwd to my evening nacho daddy experience ..\n\n\nShawn our waiter set the tone for my Saturday night meal to where this place is going to be tabled for quite sometime before I try Them again ..which is lame cause I totally planned to bring someone who isn't a square bear (my bf doesn't drink much) that will drink and  shoot Scorpion shots when I was photo ready cause admittedly I was in cozy clothes to prep for three hours at the movies after so I was not \"fancy \" to do cute tourist like selfie scorpion shots ....\n\nMy biggest pet peeve when dining is being left thirsty .. I need soda usually diet or water and refills often lol my server failed from the jump with that.. I had asked some questions about the premium margaritas .. He didn't really say much but the jalape\u00f1o is too spicy for him so  I got this cucumber chili one he recommended which wasn't on the menu but he told me about and my guy got a raspberry one both of which were tasty imo for the 11/12$ price tag but the service went all bad when Shawn left to get those without asking if I need water but also having to be prompted to get some .. Worst thing is he not only brought our margaritas before the water that was requested but we had to ask for the water again and I continually saw him walking around talking to other co workers .. Being friendly ..I'm sorry he can love his co workers but service should prevail especially when I need water ..\n\nHe didn't recommend stuff and I had to do the digging and just responded we don't have it anymore so it got old for me really fast ..\nNow when date night occurs I typically go for app, two entrees and dessert plus booze  .. This situation already had  gone downhill fast ... It gous to one entree (maybe Shawn thought due to my attire I wasn't interested in spending money ) here is the thing usually I still eat my food and spend my money but I escalate the issue .. However being on a date and having my guy prefer to not make a scene I went another route which is not order stuff to lower my tab which helps make me feel less horrible for not tipping well but it leaves me to where I'm hangry and upset ..\n\nIf you do go here check in  on yelp and you'll get a free house margarita.. It was delicious  so I may go back to the bar sometime but..  \nBe advised I only got that free margarita to make sure he knew I was checked in but also cause I thought maybe the manager or supervisor would have to authorize it and come by cause I don't usually do top shelf so if I give it a thumbs up\nSo it's  fair to say they have a good bartender \n\nFilet nachos won the entree choice due to recommendation of the dude who seated us that was nice... They are 18 something and huge so we shared those fine but it was lack meat and had way too many beans but the taste was good ... Those beans are where Shawn and I went to the point of no return cause I was going to try another premium margarita and let my guy get his dessert but ..My \nmeal ended with my boyfriend and I waiting so long for Shawn to check back that the excessive beans on our nachos that had no meat were spread out on the dish and Shawn comes up and says \"are you done playing with your beans? Which \n\nA. I guess if we had aligned and related that would of been cute but we didn't \nB. You see it not eaten and don't ask what happened or how everything was.\nC. You had enough time to watch , lurk but not check in..\n\nMy boyfriend really wanted to try the churro banana split  but he had to make due with Ben and Jerrys at redrock.. Why? Cause I couldn't handle Shawn or the sight of beans any longer..it also delayed my finding good movie seats so thanks Shawn you win!! But seriously \n\nOverall this was just not a good experience but the quality of food was not bad it was meh .."

I did order nachos, but what I got was missing the key ingredient...\"nacho cheese\". The tortillas were covered with some kind of red sauce, chicken, a few sprinkles of shredded cheese.

All the paint and decor looked almost identical to Firefly (restaurant in this space before it became nacho daddy). \n\n- Great Mix of 80's and 90's music playing with accompanying music videos, but was weird to see/hear at Nacho Daddy. \n\n- Very large menu with only 1 page of nacho dishes. I was disappointed in the selection of different nacho dishes and the fact that the rest of the menu was simply a Mexican restaurant menu. Also, the nacho dishes were listed as appetizers. I was told they would be enough for a meal. I was hungry when I finished my plate of nachos and was hungry when I left the restaurant. \n\n- Purchased the Florentine and Nacho Average Burger Nachos. The Florentine were absolutely delicious and were a play on an Italian dish essentially with prosciutto and some other goodies on top. The burger nachos were not too bad. We had the snores dessert nachos to finish things off which were pretty interesting/tasty.\n\n- The prices were a bit high for nacho appetizers $12-$15+.\n\n- my wife was excited about their extensive/diverse, coffee menu. Unfortunately, they staff was not trained on how to make any of them and only regular coffee was available. A let down.\n\n- Our server was nice and the service was decent. We had to wait a long period to get the check as the waitress seemed to disappear for a bit. Not the do all end all, but not the smoothest so would have liked. \n\n- OVERALL, the food was yummy, prices were a bit high, and it was a cool place to go as a novelty.  It seemed to have some identity issues with the mix of music, videos, etc. I don't think I'll be returning although I recommend giving it a try if you want to go somewhere different and are in the mood for Mexican. \n\nEnjoy!"

The staff here all seems to be friendly, and the manager even checked on us, which I haven't seen in quite a while at other places. We live in the north part of town and came down to Summerlin for errands, but this place is worth the drive alone!!"

I mean really, really, bad.  This is a nacho place, but the chips are horrible,  the toppings are sparse (except for the connivence store pump cheese) and no free chips and salsa, once we tried them this wasn't a big deal.\n\nThe two stars are for the deserts, we had the fried ice cream and caramel apple nachos and they were good, but the chips they used were oily and greasy.\n\nMy advice is to pass and get your mex food fix from faustos or Roberto's."

We arrived at 7:15 and the quiz had already started, but we got over it and played catchup before reading the menu.\n\nWhen the waiter came over, we gave him our drink order and said we needed more time to consider the menu. he brought us our drinks and then ignored us. We told the host wanted to order, and it still took the waiter another ten minutes before he came back (without even so much as an apology). He said he thought we didn't want anything, which made no sense because all we had ordered was water...\n\nWe shared a plate of shrimp nachos. They were totally gross and crazy expensive. $15 for a pile of soggy green tortilla chips (I just find using festively colored chips really odd) covered in a thick salty cream of all things. A few diced tomatoes and jalape\u00f1os had been sprinkled on the top, and of course some shrimp in there. It tasted like a pile of wet chemicals. I'm pretty sure nothing in there constituted as fresh foodstuffs. \n\nThe waiter came back to ask about desert. My friend asked for a coffee. The waiter said, \"Well, the cappuccino machine is broken. And so is the coffee maker. And we require REALLY hot water to make coffee. You see, we need it to be really HOT.\" \n\nIt was really bizarre. And of course, no apology again, just another disappearing waiter. Eventually he brought the check (after taking a shot with a table near us). We put down a card, and again waited, and waited, until finally we gave up and threw down exact change in cash and took off. \n\nA seriously horrible experience. Quiz host was cool, but there were no multi-media type of rounds and the venue (even without the rude service and yuck food) isn't really suitable for a quiz."

Staff was SUPER friendly. \n\nWe had the Triple dip to start, it was a great appetizer with queso, guacamole and salsa. We also tried a couple different margarita flavors but personally I loved the mango. \n\nAs entrees I had the signature tacos with pork which were gigantic! It comes with two tacos absolutely stuffed with meat. The tortillas were really good and fluffy sort of like Cafe Rio's. My favorite part of the dish may have been the rice it was SO good. \n\nI also tried the buffalo nachos. Definitely would be a good hungover or drunk food but I got pretty full at that point! The last thing we tried was the churro sundae which came with two churros and three scoops of ice cream. I feel like they could have reversed that with two scoops of ice cream and three or four churros. The ice cream seemed to melt before we could get to it.\n\nOverall it was an awesome experience and I think people will have a really good time here. They also have scorpion shots which I witnessed but don't think I'll be participating in. Good times, great food and drinks!"

We had chips and guacamole for an appetizer (good for two people- order an extra if you have more than that), carne asada and the nacho average burger nachos (don't even try to share- get your own and eat the whole dang thing yourself. You deserve it. Hell, its Vegas! Be fat for a week). I was still recuperating from the previous night's drinks, so I didn't try their margaritas but I've heard they are to die for! Eat here! There's nothing else I can say. You have to experience this place for yourself. Oh! Almost forgot- this place is great for vegans!

We stumbled upon the location in downtown last year and found that they opened this new location off the strip.\n\n     On this trip to Vegas, we've eaten here twice.   All of the menu is good, as a large group of us have tried multiple food choices!  Being from Texas and getting chips & salsa as an appetizer with your meal for free, is the norm. Here it is not. So we bought the chips & salsa appetizer. They make three different in-house sauces and two of the three we really enjoyed. The mild and the hot are excellent salsas, but the medium just didn't cut it for us. We enjoy the Naked Grilled wings in buffalo sauce. They are quality wings with lots of meat!  Let me also rave about the white queso dip! It's basic, but really good.  My wife loved it!\n     \n     For this review, I only took pictures of the meal that we ate this time. This meal was the Hot Buffalo Chicken Nachos, which are chips covered in queso with popcorn chicken that has been tossed in their buffalo sauce. Then they drizzle a ranch dressing across the top, add some celery, some green onions and, wallah, you have spicy nachos! On our first meal, just 2 days prior to this review, I had the Nacho Average Burger Nachos, and they were delicious.  Others had the Filet Mignon Nachos. We all drank buy 1 get 1 free margaritas, and they were excellent.\n\n     The service is great.  The first visit we had Mark as our server.  He was very attentive and quick.  Great personality.  On this review visit, we had Victoria as our server.  She was great.  Very bubbly and sweet. Outgoing and willing to get what we needed. There is also a food Runner / assistant named Humberto.  Let me tell you, this guy was fantastic! I told the manager, Mikey, that Humberto was a great employee and Mikey appreciated hearing that about him.\n\n     I very rarely will give five stars, but Nacho Daddy on the strip in Vegas is well deserved. I even went as far as telling them they should bring this restaurant to the DFW area in Texas. If you're ever in Vegas, go check them out. I don't think you'll be disappointed!"

My group of five was pretty hungry so we each ordered our own nachos and shared family style. The waitress said one nacho order could feed 2 to 3 people but she didn't know how we do. We ordered the Filet Mignon nacho (BEST!), Buffalo Hot nacho (yummy for those buffalo wing lovers), Nacho Average Burger nacho (tastes like a cheeseburger), Carnitas nacho (SO YUMMY) and some other one that is not on the yelp menu. Obviously, the last one wasn't that memorable so that can be skipped. \nThey are open 24 hours on the weekend so definitely give this a try on your next Vegas trip."

Very nice atmosphere on the strip. \n\nFOOD: Started with the dip trio. Salsa was spicy & flavorful, but not mouth burning. The guac was delicious! It was chunky & you could taste the onion and garlic. The cheese was zesty with jalape\u00f1os, but again not overpowering. I had the chicken chimichanga. I take my chimis bery seriously. Many places claim to have a fried shell but do not OR dont offer the fried shell. Well isnt that a burrito then? This chimi was large in size and had a perfectly fried shell! The chicken inside was flavored very well which mixed masterfully with the guac on top. One negative: there were also beans & the way mine was rolled it seemed like the right half was chicken & the left half was beans instead of being a great combo of each in every bite.\n\nSERVICE: id have to agree with prior reviews & say it was disappointing. Our waitress greeted us with her depressing story about how shed rather be home in bed. Not what anyone wants to chat about before dinner. Perhaps some customer service lessons for the crew are in order. \n\nOverall it was a great dinner & i would / will definitely be back for another try!"

Wij zijn niet bekend met taco's, enchilada enz maar we wilden het toch eens proberen. Wij hebben voor nacho's gekozen en het was super lekker. De porties waren ook erg groot, dus zorg dat je honger hebt  En net buiten de drukte van de Strip, wat wij aangenaam vonden. Een aanrader!!!"

The place was fairly busy, but the hostess knew of our party and promptly, without even asking, guided us to the stairs that led to our party. Point for knowing the situation.\n\nService was ok, just a bit slow at times but understandable since our party had about 18 people all putting in various orders at various times, and only one server, MJ. She did a great job handling all of us. Billing was perfect, no issues there.\n\nI had the beer battered lobster tacos, that came with a side of rice and side of beans....standard fare. The tacos were tasty, loaded with salsa that almost overwhelmed the entire dish. I wish the lobster would have been a bit larger so it balanced out all the lettuce and salsa better. \n\nI'll give them 3.5 stars. I'm not a huge fan of Nacho Daddy, based on a few meals at the old Henderson location."

We had some special request and the waitress SERRENA got our order right on the spot!! \nFast forward to today. We are going back home to San Francisco so we stopped in for breakfast since they opened at 8. And guess who our waistress was... We got our seats and our waitress SERRENA immediately remembered us from the other night AND she also remembered what we ordered AND the specifics (no cilantro, add jalape\u00f1os etc) i was immediately impressed and she is super sweet and friendly! The funniest part was when she caught my husband inspecting his vegan chicken and she came up to ask if everything was ok. We laughed because one he got caught and two because the reason he was inspecting it was because it taste just like real chicken and the flavor was amazing!

The nachos were soy-based, which worked out for my nut-allergies, and I was told that the dish was also gluten free. I saw another server bring out an order of the same, and couldn't believe that the giant sized plate was the same our table had received. Apparently, I had scarfed down the entire thing, and still wanted more.\n\nOur server Dezi was so nice. She made us feel welcomed and was quick to take care of our needs."

I look forward to my next visit to Nacho Daddy"

So little help from the hostess or the bar. Nothing is marked vegetarian on the menu - tho they have an icon - and even their chips and salsa remain unmarked. So unless you're a carnivore or don't eat cheese I would avoid this place. Also service was awful. It took at least 15 mins before I could ask about vegetarian menu items... overall I'm just so disappointed... \n\nService: 1 star.\nVegetarian friendly: less than one star. \n\nThat's all I can attest to because we left."

We tried the BBQ Chicken nachos and ordered 6 naked BBQ wings, which were also great! The wings had a spicy dry rub and came with the BBQ sauce on the side.  The nachos were piled high with pulled chicken, although they had a bit too much BBQ sauce for my opinion and could have used a bit more salsa and cilantro.  Happy hour was also starting and we couldn't pass up $4 draft Mexican beer.  Just off the main Las Vegas Strip with outdoor seating in the Miracle Mile shops its a nice place to grab a quick eat!"

However, my in-law had ordered some chicken plate and was very dry and we had to replace it with another enchilada. First it took them a while to get his order out and then to find it was all dry. Then by the time enchilada came, not much hunger or mood left! However, their dessert dried ice-cream was really good. The cancelled item showed up on the receipt and we asked them to cancel it which they honored. \nFriendly customer service. But overall food was okay. Definitely try their Fried Ice-Cream!\n1 Spicy Burrito = $12.95\n1 V.

All the hostess were sweet and nice and everything was good up until my friends' orders came out so I waited for my order which never came. Our server was busy waiting a large group that came in after us, which was understandable but time kept going and the table needed refills and my friends' were basically done eating their huge plates of food before we were able to flag down our server about what happened to my order. A huge platter of tacos went to that table he was helping. He said he'll let us know and then goes over to the big party. Basically takes care of that big party the whole time. He walks by and says it'll be out soon. It's been well over 40 minutes for two tacos with rice and beans by that time. My friends are stuffed and done with their food and I had to go, it's close to an hour now. So I flagged the waiter down and just politely asked if we could just cancel my order. He tells me it's literally done but we've been sitting there and everyone in my party is sitting there done while he's been serving that one large party. I  needed to leave so I just told him it's ok I'd rather not take it because I wouldn't be able to eat it or keep it on me. I'm not one to take home food either if I didn't buy food for the whole family. He comes back and inquires about why I don't wanna take it home so I tell him I have things to do and I don't wanna eat all of this in front of my family and he replies with \"so you don't eat in front of your family?\" Which was pretty rude so I told him well I'm not gonna sit there and have them watch me eat and not have bought food for everyone? I've waited so long for this food and literally everyone was finished and we had to move on. The place was not even busy. Plus I don't understand why a small order was suddenly done when I wanted to cancel it and he's being rude to me about it. Oddly enough after getting us our check he apologizes and says it's all his fault. But it's insincere because just a minute ago he didn't understand how I wouldn't want to take the food with me when there could be a number of reasons why and it's no ones business. I would've been fine if he just canceled it but having to explain myself and having his comments just really made a bad experience."

It sounds like a gimmick to draw you in. We laughed at the name but glanced in and it seemed like a cool spot with open air and all we wanted was a snack to hold us over so it wasn't the end of the world if we had mediocre food.\n\nFish tacos sounded like a good option for a snack but the waitress upped the ante by suggesting the signature tacos because of the homemade tortilla. I can't possibly say no to that - I was game. And indeed, as she claimed, these grilled fish tacos on homemade tortillas were fantastic. What a great suggestion, one that got us to revisit this place a few days later.\n\nWhat I will say about Nacho Daddy is that the service and hospitality was excellent in both of our visits. No one left you hanging - people came by right after we sat down but also checked in with us periodically to see how we were doing. This place was a pleasant surprise that was also convenient to our hotel."

Unfortunately, the margarita was overwhelmingly sweet and sour mix.  Their sweet and sour is made in house and actually pretty good, but the margarita itself was not well made.  I know it was free, but if it was a true representation of their margaritas, I wouldn't get one here.\n\nAside from that, this is a good place to eat affordably on the strip.  It's part of the Miracle Mile Shops, but the entrance is located on the outside of the shops.  There's plenty of seating and TVs everywhere for watching whatever is on.  \n\nAs the name suggests, they have a large variety of nachos to choose from.  I couldn't decide which one to get, so I chose the Burger Nachos ($13.50) because it had a star next to it.  It had everything a burger would normally have, but tasted a lot like a taco salad.  They weren't bad, but something I could easily put together at home.  I was more impressed by my friend's enchilada nachos.  It tasted just like enchiladas, but in nacho form.\n\nIt's a cool place to go with your friends and grab a casual bite.  Just don't get the house margarita."

The shrimp fajitas for two was huge and yummy.  The naked wings were also good and my 'Daddy Bowl' with quinoa and chicken was superb.  All of this food was high quality, reasonably priced and our server Jovanny was super friendly and attentive without being invasive.  Two drinks, an appetizer, shrimp fajitas for two, and the daddy bowl came to $77 after tax excluding tip.

Came here for lunch only to get their nachos to-go. We ordered 3 of their nachos to take back to our hotel for a party of 8. \n\n* Ordered: \n- Filet Mignon nachos (5/5 stars): As soon as we got our order & had to wait for our uber driver to pick us up.... we completely finished this entire box between 4 of us before uber even got to us! LOL! We had to order another box. The mixed fish, cheese, & salsa make this a good combo with chips.\n\n- Seafood nachos (3/5 stars): This was our least favorite, but was still finished by the end of the day. I think the mango was too fresh that it didn't taste as well with the seafood & my cousin agreed.\n\n- Fiesta nachos (4/5 stars): This was our 2nd favorite. Packed with meat, cheese, & colorful chips. Definitely looks like a fiesta in a box. There was a lot of meat in this one.\n\nMissed out on the full sports bar & drinks but they do serve happy hour, gear, & games to participate to win in! All 3 boxes were good for a party of 8. Not a full entree, but good enough for a filling snack in between drinking throughout the day!"

Three out of four drinks came out before the meal, but the fourth hadn't come by the time our meal came--and neither had the chips and salsa we ordered. We inquired, and the chips came out, but the last drink didn't. It took another reminder, after we were almost finished with our meal, to finally get the last drink.\n\nTheir nachos are very good, and so are the margaritas. I preferred the Daddy's margarita, which was more balanced, over the house margarita, which was too sweet."

We got a lot more than that - great food and great service. \n\nWe got here a little after noon and was quickly seated inside. As the hour progressed, more and more people came. Yelp has a free margarita for a check-in so that was the first thing we were on the mission for. Jovanny was our waiter and he just exuded warmth and hospitality (I might be biased because he called me exotic looking ;) He brought us out our margaritas right after taking our orders. I'm not a huge fan of margaritas but this was good! Plus, it came in a cute mason jar which was nice. \n\nJovanny came by with some chips and salsa on the house (this guy is such a sweetheart!). Our food came by pretty quickly. I got the dry chicken wings with BBQ sauce and my fianc\u00e9 got the supreme tostada nachos with vegan chick'n. I LOVED my wings - they were crispy and I got to dip it in as much sauce as I wanted. My fianc\u00e9 devoured the nachos but the few bites I was able to get, it was so good! For people who like spicy, that is a great option! \n\nBottom line, this is a great place to grab a bite and a drink. Make sure to ask for Jovanny :)"

So we waited at the bar and got some drinks. 20 minutes later the hostess called my phone from a whole 10 feet away to tell us our table was ready.  Once we were seated at our table, we waited 20 minutes for a server to show up.  No one ever did, although someone had the time to come by and pick up our menus, otherwise ignoring us. I finally went up to the hostess stand to ask them to send us a server. Except the hostess was outside talking to someone, so I had to ask a busser. The hostess finally came by and said she'd send a server over. We waited another 15 minutes and no one showed up. We finally decided to move back to the bar since we knew at least the bartender was working and could put in an order. Apparently prep work was more important than paying customers, because one of our party overheard her tell the barback she was too busy to take our order.  One hour of waiting later, we walked out.  We specifically came here because of the nachos and because it was local. So much for supporting a local business."

The pitcher poured like 2 drinks maybe... so if you want average nachos and ripoff drinks, then I guess it's fine. There's simply better places to go, but most of Las Vegas is designed to rip you off. I mean, it's the gambling capitol of the world, so I guess by Vegas standards this place deserves the 4 stars or so it has, but otherwise it's a 2. Would be 3 if the prices were more reasonable. Then a 4 if the food was actually better than average."

The place was pretty quiet when we arrived, perhaps because people were still recovering from all of the excitement from the night before, or maybe because the location of the restaurant is off the beaten path... it sits on East Harmon a little away from the corner of Las Vegas Blvd, getting overshadowed by the infamous Taco Bell Cantina. We opted to sit at the bar and was greeted by the bartender immediately. We kept it simple and decided to share an order of Ultimate Supreme Nachos. They were good, not overly outstanding, and could've been warmer. I do appreciate that there was a really good toppings-to-chips ratio and the bartender even offered to bring a few extra chips, if needed. Pricewise, it was a little more than I'd prefer to pay for nachos but given that it was a restaurant near The Strip, the higher price is pretty much expected. Perhaps we will return again on the next trip and try out the seafood nachos."

We sat down with an ambience that I could only imagine will be perfect for a Friday night. We came on a Saturday afternoon so it was quite relaxing. This is where we meet our server Mark. Mark was the BEST server I have ever had hands down. He was funny, lively, and went out of his way to make our experience here the BEST it could have been. He was prompt, precise and engaging. I had an issue with a coupon code for another nacho daddy and he corrected the issue with NO problem. \n\nThe food: oh my gosh. We first got the triple dipper which was frankly okay. I love queso so I was most excited for that, which is the reason for my okay status. But the triple dipper didn't even matter once we got our entrees. First of all we only wanted one basket of chips (even though we were offered a refill) and by the time we picked up the last chip our food was arriving. I would like to say thank you to Ruben for running the food, he was just as courteous as Mark and treated our table with respect. He and Mark were more than we could have asked for for exceptional service. So the main courses. I NEED to talk about the street tacos. This is a MUST. If you're a Tex mex connoisseur like me, you know NEVER to order chicken from a Tex mex place you've never been to ( for those who may not favor this type of food as much as me, you don't because it's typically dry). It was DRIPPING with juices and I was shocked! My friend ordered them because I was steering clear of anything chicken because of the previously stated reasoning. I regretted not getting them. They were so amazing and flavorful. Side note: EVERYTHING besides the guac was peak perfection for flavoring ( guac wasn't bad, you just had to add a little something like salt which I thought was thoughtful for people with salt sensitivities). I ordered for me and my friend to share the filet mignon nachos. They were so delicious and the perfect plate of nachos. I went ahead and added the queso from the triple dipper and there was no going back. We didn't have room for desert but it was so good without it.\n\nOverall: I am so pleased that I chose this place and would recommend it to anyone, I even raved about the place to the couple that walked in as I was sitting at my table. My hope is that they can make their way out to LA soon so I can get the chance to experience this restaurant again! \nThank you to Mikey as well for leading a GREAT team!\n\n- edit : the margaritas are from God himself but be careful because they taste like juice and they will creep on you!"

I was happy to learn they had specials on both on a sunny Tuesday in November.  Service was so- so.  The place was pretty empty and the server seemed hungover and dis-interested.  Luckily she did tell me about the taco and drink specials - 3 tacos for 5$ - YAY and 2 for 1 top shelf tequila!  Yay again!  Corn tortillas are a little thick and chewy for my taste, but I like that they have lobster and crab, both fresh and well seasoned.  I will be back to try the Nachos!"

When the food came we had one bbq chicken and a bbq pulled pork. I tried to explain to the expo that I ordered buffalo chicken and he tried to tell me that's what I had in front of me. When the bartender came back to check on us I explained to her what happened. She said it was her fault and 10 minutes later my buffalo nachos came out. They were horrible. The chicken on top was fried chicken nuggets that were completely soggy. The entire plate was covered in Franks Red Hot (don't get me wrong franks is great but not alone on top of chips for $12.) Sad to say I was that person who sent it back. Our BBQ nachos were good but nothing I would come back for. The server was great and took off one of our drinks, which I can always appreciate good service. Maybe just drinks and a light snack is the way to go here."

This world where everyone's favorite food group (that's right, FOOD GROUP) is not only featured, but the focus of their menu. How awesome is that? Could it get more awesome? Yes it could (if they put one in Reno) being in Vegas is pretty amazing! \n\nLocated right outside The Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood it is pretty convenient, especially if you're in the shopping or Nacho mood. Patio seating with an aircraft hangar style door, also a great centrally located industrial concrete bar, and warm sunlight (in case it happens to be a cold day, as it was for us). \n\nBecause we seemingly don't know how to settle for a stock off the menu selection we went with the Supreme Tostada Nacho, but asked for the pico on the side and also a side of the enchilada sauce, but without the lettuce (cause that did seem weird, right?). First, how awesome was the bartender? They brought out our order and he immediately noticed the presence of lettuce and threw up the stop sign. All apologies, it was returned to the kitchen and a fresh prepped replacement was brought shortly thereafter. Second, these were the best nachos ever!!!! Ermergosh! Such a great blend of flavors and I was halfway through the order, before I remembered we had the sides. Unfortunately, I had waited so long that the enchilada sauce had cooled before I got to it, because I'm sure warmer would have been better (still pretty good). \n\nI digress, let me finish this thing. Aside from amazing nachos, the bar hosts plenty of tequila (as they should), some decent beer (some local), and a friendly, smiling, engaging, conversational, smart, fun staff. Who wouldn't want to be here, eat here, roll around in a pool of nachos here? I'll never return to Vegas, without visiting here!"

Yelp came to the rescue and I saw the Nacho Daddy was within the Miracle Mile which is connected to the Elara. It feels like you're exiting the property which you are but when you turn right, the establishment is right there close to - couple yards from the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd. If you sit outside you can hear and see a lot of the hustle of the strip. \n\nNachos were really good, I was happy to see all the vegetarian options. I would have liked my nachos to be more cheesy. They were perfectly spiced however and the flavors all melded very well. Huge portions and so two people can easily share. I had a peach margarita along with my meal which was quite strong but good. I was happy with the prospect that I could take it to go as I had an early morning but still wanted to enjoy it back in my room. They had live music while I was there and it was a fun little joint to enjoy when you sort of just want to get away from what is the strip. Will defiantly be back when in Vegas. Not for that scorpion shot though!"

I had been drinking, and I'm sure most of their customers have also been down the same alley leading up to this point in the night. \n\nThe check in deal on Yelp was a huge plus for a free house margarita, the cool server that everyone talks about, Jovanny, even let my wife and I have one each for checking in. He then forgot them and we had to ask again, all the sudden he brought out 4. (There was a table of 10 of us so we shared) Great customer service by him for not even making a big mistake it wasn't 2 minutes later than the rest of the drinks.\n\nWith such a large group I anticipated not only a wait to be seated, then a long wait for food. This wasn't the case at all, actually the place was pretty dead for a Friday night. We were seated immediately and had food and drinks quickly. I'm surprised there weren't more customers as I'd definitely return if I lived nearby.\n\nI had just a standard nacho with beef, cheese, avocado, sour cream, etc. just your normal nacho. The amount of ground beef was ample, and they really built this nacho up. They didn't do the stack of chips then toppings, it was mixed in sporadically. The amount of real cheese, then also a nice nacho cheese made this wonderful.\n\nI was very surprised to find that even by the end the nachos were not soggy, everything was still crisp and firm!\n\nOne nacho is enough to share for kind of a drunk meal to top off the night, most in our party got their own and did not finish, or get remotely close.\n\nOnly downside is someone in our party ordered wings. He absolutely hated them and thought they were horrible. He shared with several people at our table and no one was fond of them. He did tell our server and since he shared them it was no longer valid to be refunded. We weren't really bent on the refund, but what a silly policy. Over half still there and since he shared them he couldn't even get a discount. I didn't stop hearing about the wings all weekend. Bummer."

I would have been ok if he told me he was going to take care of my appetizer only, but don't tell me your going to do something and not do it.  That's the worst !   Worst part about the experience is it was dead, so they had no excuse on the amount of time to attend someone.  Would I recommend it to someone ... I don't know if they have service like that maybe not, but the food is really good!\n\nI think the Mgr should have been out on the floor helping if they were short handed, or whatever the case was.  I saw a few employees just standing in the back just staring right back at me ! WTF! That is another management problem."

The ambiance is nice--it's rather dark inside but not overly so, and the tank of scorpions at the entrance was definitely eye-catching. The menu is pretty large, as are the actual nacho dishes themselves. I am not sure if they are all the same size, but we went with the Supreme Tostada Nachos and they were definitely enough for two people. Even though there wasn't a lot of food per se, there were enough calories in all the cheese and saucy goodness to last for a long while. All in all the dish was balanced and done very well, with the chips remaining crispy while we ate and flavorful salsa and ground meat distributed all around. They did screw up on the Daddy's Wings though; while the meat was perfectly done, the sauce on the outside was way too salty and made the wings pretty hard to eat. Maybe just a fluke? Remember to check in for that margarita."

They have over a dozen different options where it is more than just changing a topping a two.\n\nWe started with the queso dip.  This was actually one of the best ones that I have had.  It was a nice portion and the unique aspect was that it was set up almost like a fondue holder having a flame underneath to keep the cheese melted.\n\nWe then had an order of the spicy shrimp nachos and the smothered burrito.  Both hit the spot!  The nachos are definitely big enough for 2 to share and be more than filled.\n\nThis isn't going to be fine dining by any means but if you are looking for something above fast food Mexican at a reasonable price this is a solid option."

I had been to the downtown location over a year ago looking for the scorpion shots, and they had run out of scorpions. I was so psyched to get to try them this time, and the location so convenient.\n\nThe bartender recommended a really smooth silver tequila - I can't remember what it was. It came in a double shot, totaling $14 I think. Totally worth it! However... I did not dare eat/swallow the scorpion. I was not that adventurous. I totally disappointed everyone in the restaurant who watched when they heard the bartender ring the bell (they do that to bring attention to someone buying the scorpion shot). Oh well, I got my photo and experience of having a dead scorpion in my mouth for a few seconds! Haha.\n\nOH YEAH and they have a vegan section fo their menu I never knew about.

This place was right across from the hotel (it's part of PH's Miracle Mile Shops), and it was new, so we opted to try it out. As it was Saturday night, there was a fairly long line, of course, so we were expecting a ~15-minute wait. The host hooked us up, though, by giving us a spot at the bar - probably since we were the only, or one of the only, couple(s) (i.e., nongroup) there.\n\nIn my at times utterly futile, but steadfast, quest to go vegetarian, I went right to the menu's vegan section (it's quite a nice selection, BTW), and opted for the Vegan Chick'n Tacos. It came with wild rice, black beans, chipotle onions and salsa (along with the chick'n, obviously). Honestly, this faux chicken tasted as close to actual poultry as anything I can remember in some time - marinated nicely, fresh, cooked just right. Really good. The beans and rice went well with all of that. Didn't mess with the chipotle onions too much - whew, were they hot! Between my lemonade and water I was guzzling for a couple minutes there.\n\nNot a drinker, so can't speak about the quality of their spirits; the Ms. enjoyed her Mai Tai, FWeTW, as well as the chicken - the \"e\" included - enchiladas (and they did look really good).\n\nI wish I'd gotten our bartender/server's name - she was a hoot! Energetic, attentive, and friendly. The atmosphere was laid-back and relaxed, at least at the bar.\n\nAll told, everything came out to ~$40 or so - not bad for what turned out to be dinner on the Strip.\n\nGlad we tried this spot. Will definitely return next visit to Sin City.\n\n(Sorry for the pic-less review - I'm new to Yelping. Next time, though!)"

They have a lot of \"specialty\" nachos - which is great for the variety - but the prices are ridiculous. The waitress, when we asked about portion size, told us we could probably all three share 1 nacho order and be fine and full. We were so hopeful!

I got a pomegranate margarita; it tasted great and was very potent, loved it.\n\nMy wife and I split a fried ice cream dessert. It was certainly ON POINT.

I get the chicken tacos and dip them in queso - another awesome thing on the menu. \nI recommend the queso dip as an app as well. \nI usually get the Buffalo Nachos. They never get old and I eat them at least once a week! They're the right amount of spicy, too. They're quite large and there also on the happy hour menu. \n\nI recommend everyone getting the margarita you get for free when you check in. Their margaritas are so yummy and they're pretty potent .\nI recommend this place to anyone looking for a cool, kick ass local place."

They have unique nacho dishes worth trying along with traditional Mexican and Tex-Mex food. Servers are very nice and like a sports bar type of atmosphere with lots of sports games on TVs everywhere. It's a good and fine place to bring kids (don't have to worry about them yelling in a quiet restaurant). According to our waiter, place just opened about 3 months ago, but already very popular. Some dishes are a little pricey, but not as bad as eating at some of the main Strip hotel restaurants. Worth trying!"

After a  couple of frustrating days (in which we had our car broken into and were burgled), we were in desperate need of some positive vibes. Meeting Jovanny was easily one of the best things about this (very eventful) trip. From his excellent customer service to his bubbly, warm personality, we were thrilled to have him as our server. He was very sympathetic to our plight and made our dining experience extra special to ensure we left feeling better about our time in Vegas. \n\nThe margaritas, nachos, and chips and salsa were all fantastic. I would rate Nacho Daddy a four or five based on that alone, but the service we experienced with Jov was second to none (and I'm serious - best ever). The staff who brought out our food were super polite and friendly as well. I only wish we could leave 10 stars.\n\nThank you for helping to salvage our vacation!"

At one point our waitress vanished and I couldn't get a water refill, but when she was on point, she was very on point. Side note- she was very cute and had a rocking hair cut. Anyway, randomly picked Nacho Daddy for a night out with my friends after we finished our conference responsibilities for the trip and we wanted nothing more than to get away from the conference center and down the strip for some food (and refreshments for my friends, which I passed on). The waitress gave great recommendations. Between the four of us we got the cheese enchiladas, the filet mignon nachos, lobster tacos, mini fish tacos, and the Mexican corn. I had the corn and the fish tacos. \n\nThe corn was tasty but not the best I've had -it was very, very light on the cojita cheese, and the seasoning was only on side of the corn, and barely had any crema. Elote is one of my favourite foods, so I was a tad disappointed. The fish tacos were tasty, I liked the mango salsa. My friends enjoyed their food and drinks as well. The servings were humongous, and the prices were reasonable- and it must have been happy hour because my tacos were discounted. I asked about the Yelp check in but it was after we ordered and apparently we didn't have the right kind of margarita, but definitely take them up on that, it's a great offer. \n\nWould definitely try the nachos if I were to ever return, I just felt like getting something with more protein than cheese (full disclosure, I'm pescetarian- I did like the option of the vegan menu but wanted to try two smaller menu items instead. Would try them in the future if I were to return though!). The decor and vibe of the place was great and we were seated in a cozy booth with a good view of the open kitchen!"

They have embraced their scorpion theme with a giant scorpion terarium where you can watch them prey on little crickets, and they offer a scorpion shot that comes with a little baby scorpion in it. \n\nService was pretty blah. First they forgot our margaritas, then they forgot about 1/2 our order and had to come back to ask us what we wanted again. Good thing they did though because I wanted the vegan fajita bowl and they forgot it was even vegan! \n\nFood came out and they forgot we ordered the garlic cheese fries, a side salad, no onions ina. Sandwich, and sour cream. So they had to go back and make it and bring back out. \n\nPretty slow service all around as well but there weren't that many people there. \n\nwould probably come back for late night drunk eats, and for the free margarita you get with a check in!"

Ceviche was tasty and very fresh. Only thing is I think there's to many chips for the serving. Picture to follow. Kids nachos were big portion we added chicken to them which was very good. Quesadilla was not very tasty. Needs to have less cheese and more crisp tortilla. It taste more like oil. Our server Gio was friendly and upbeat! Made good conversation and took care of us. Overall it's a good place to eat as a family. Lots of tvs and we got the Sunday night game after asking the GM! When we asked a server passing by he came back saying the owner wanted to watch the hockey game. So when he came by asking what could he do to make our expierence better we asked for the Sunday night game which he said ok to. We thought it was wired when we got the first response.

Our group took the shots together, and one of my friends made the mistake of chewing the little bugger... don't do that.\n\nMargaritas were excellent, nachos were killer (one of the best bangs for your buck in Vegas - try the shrimp or the filet mignon nachos!), but honestly the service was even better.  Audre was our hostess and was absolutely amazing.  We actually came back a second night during our week-long stay to take more scorpion shots, mainly because of the friendly atmosphere.
