            "review": "As seen on diners, drive-ins and dives, yes fat choy is located inside the eureka casino located next to SLS. i came here with a couple of girlfriends for lunch one day because we had heard good things about this place. they're really known for their baos and we ordered both the duck and pork belly- delicious and i highly recommend it! we also got the wonton soup with noodles but thought it was quite bland. we ordered the sesame noodles as well and thought it was lacking flavor. we got the hot wings too and it was just your ordinary buffalo sauce wings that you can find from anywhere so that wasn't too impressive. besides the food, the service was prompt and attentive which we appreciate. even though most of our food were lacking something extra, the baos were definitely worth the hype!"

            "review": "Unique menu items, cute little place inside an old casino, quick service. Easy 4 stars.\n\nMy go to sandwich is the pork belly BLT. Pork on top of more pork. Can you say heart attack? Pork belly is fatty and rich while the bacon is crispy and salty. Explosion of flavor in my mouth. It is on the greasier side, so prepare to use a lot of napkins. I'm glad I have turned a fellow yelper, Tom F. on to this sandwich. \n\nThe vibe is upbeat, depending on who you go with. The service is fast and friendly, also depending on who you go with or if the restaurant gets crowded. I will return, but only after a few gym sessions to work off this sandwich.\n\nTip: take a deep breath before entering the casino and you can exhale once you enter Fat Choy. The cigarette smoke is pretty strong, unless you want the black lung, then that's cool too."

Mixing the duck meat with the egg and rice created a creamy, just-enough fatty dish that was hard to resist.  The duck bao was incredibly, finished with hoisen sauce and a sliver of cucumber.  And the grilled cheese with short rib meat was over the moon delicious!  We'll be back!"

The soft white bun hugging the greasy slab of meat, greens, and crushed peanuts is quite beautiful and should be devoured immediately. Other highlights include the potstickers, sesame noodles, and duck rice and baos. Will this food destroy your New Year's Resolutions? Absolutely. But will you feel great while eating? Yas."

Of course, what's considered fine dining these days? Can't remember the last time I wore a jacket to a fancy joint. \n\nHere is an example of fine dining quality food that you reach at the end of a haze of stale smoke. Cost savings of the missing maitre d' passed on to you. Besides, the staff is friendly so you won't notice.\n\nSkip the middle, patronize joints like this."

            "review": "This place is just okay. I honestly had higher hopes. First off it's located in Eureka Casino and since the casino is so small all the smoke comes into this little restraunt which can be really bothersome to those with allergies or asthma. It was still bothersome to me even though I chose the last booth in the back of the restraunt. \n\nWe had our hearts set on soft shell crab bao since we heard good things on yelp about them but were informed that they were seasonal and were not currently on the menu. Also as stated on yelp they didn't have a 3 piece bao combo. Talk about a buzz kill. I already knew I was going to order shortrib grilled cheese ams we would share both the bao and sandwich . Since they didn't have the soft shell crab we ordered the Peking duck bao which comes with 2 buns with meat cucumber and sprouts ? Don't quite remember but my taste buds have also forgotten them. I feel that the meat was lacking flavor and it was boring. Didn't taste fresh. \n\nShortrib Grilled Cheese - our server suggested it on sourdough so I went with her opinion. I feel that the sandwich is very heavy so they serve it with a tomato jam to cut the heaviness but the tomato jam I feel didnt quite highlight or compliment the flavor of the shortrib. It was a bit greasy as well. The fries were crispy and cooked perfectly. \n\nOur server  Jenny was very friendly attentive and helpful with the menu  and explained how the dishes were Prepared and cooked and talked about the ingredients so forth. So this place gets 3 stars."

I don't think I can find these two flavorful dishes anywhere else. The potstickers are the best I've ever had, maybe in my life. The pork belly baos are also super delicious. I am always craving coming back here."

The menu is very limited which, in my experience, is usually a good thing as the restaurant then does a few things well! This was no different. The pork belly bao was great and so was the duck, even though I am not much of a duck fan. The chicken teriyaki bowl was fabulous. Bar is beer and wine only but loved the Lucky Buddha beer in a fun bottle! My only negative was that it was inside a smokey casino with what seemed to be poor ventilation. It is also not in a great area. If you are feeling adventurous, give it a go!"

I had no idea inside the \"neighborhood\" casino was one the best places to enjoy some very tasteful delights.\n\nHe had told me about the menu, even showed me pictures of the food, but it wasn't until I took my first bite of their pork belly bao that I knew I was hooked.\n\nWe knew we had to try the bao and the burgers so we ordered both.  When the bao arrived to the table, they both looked so appealing, making my mouth water.  \n\nThe pork belly was a big strip of pork  which was decent in size, with a layer of fat and a crispy skin.  The cilantro and pickled mustard greens with peanuts pulled it all together.\n\nThe Peking duck bao was good with a hoisin sauce and cucumbers, but it was the pork belly bao that stood out.\n\nWe ordered their Fat Choy Burger which made the top 10 burger list, but we asked for the egg over hard, I don't care for runny yolks. The angus beef patty was juicy and cooked to perfection and the braised short ribs were so tender it almost melted in my mouth.\n\nI loved the onion jam mixed with the secret sauce, and talk about full strips of bacon, loved it.  I was told the bun comes from La Brea Bakery it was so yummy."

            "review": "Short Ribs Grilled Cheese Sandwich!!!\n\nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words.  It's the pictures, not the reviews, of Fat Choy's Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich that got me to bookmark this place. I didn't know much of Fat Choy or even the Eureka Casino until Terri R. mentioned it during lunch a couple of weeks ago.  I read a couple of reviews and thought maybe.  But after looking at a few pictures, I knew I had to eventually pay a visit for their Short Ribs Grilled Cheese. \n\nYesterday was perfect.  I was in a meeting in California and just experienced a really bad lunch.  In the middle of my presentation, I get the text from Terri R. to meet at Fat Choy for dinner when I get back in town. If you read Terri R's review, she mentioned she dragged me here.  Not even close.  No one has to drag me to anything that equals me eating. Remember, my favorite food is seconds. \n\nThe service was really good, but also expected since we were 2 out of only 4 customers in this joint.  Of course I had the short ribs grilled cheese w/fries and Terri had the same.  The sandwich is as good as advertised.  Imagine a perfectly made grilled cheese sandwich and a couple of pieces of tender fall off the bone short ribs.  Then put those together with sauce that isn't overpowering and not too much of it.  That's what you get with Fat Choy's Short Rib Grilled Cheese.  It's worth another visit and if I was still a drinker, this would make the perfect hangover meal."

I knew nothing about this place, except it's the brick n mortar to the food truck @GreatBaoLV.\n\nOverall, good comfort food. Portions are sharable, but not huge.  Free wifi, but a tiny place, so I'm sure once this place gets buzzing, it'll be food to go for many.\n\nIts better than a 3 star, but not quite a 4.  \nIf it wasn't in such a smoke filled casino, I'd go back."

            "review": "Went here for the 3 for $10 bao special and the fluff ice was an extra added bonus. I enjoyed the 3 baos, duck, pork belly, and the crispy soft shell crab. My favorite was the soft shell crab, so unique with it's soft sweet bao texture, then the light and crisp crunchyness of the soft shell crab. \nI also tried the Fat Choy burger. It was cooked perfectly medium. The patty is quite thick and beefy with the yummy shredded short rib meat on top of the patty with crispy bacon and a runny fried egg. Perfectly delicious. Also the fries were cooked as an art form!  They were skinny fries that were crisp on the outside and nice and buttery on the inside, like eating a fat fry, only it was a skinny fry. This chef really knows how to make fries. \n\nFluff ice guys are only here for a limited time, at the time of this review fluff ice is leaving on 6/23/13 to go back to Cali:  Then for dessert I had to have a fluff ice drink with egg pudding. I usually get my fix in california, but hey, if the egg pudding comes to you in vegas, why go to cali?  I got the large egg pudding and lychee jelly drink which was a little sweet at first because I didn't mix it. Once you mix it, it is a great balance of sweet and savory. They should team up with Fat Choy and make a Fluff ice with crispy bacon, that sounds good. \n\nTo adress it being inside the Eureka casino, there is a guard in the parking lot, and the casino really wasn't that smoky on a friday night. Inside the restaurant I couldn't smell any ciggy smoke at all."

The food was so memorable last time that it more than made up for the smokey location.  \nThis time around, the prok belly bao was delicious, but the duck bao and the potstickers were mediocre.  And the short rib grilled cheese was a letdown, with the flavor being OK, but I don't think the ingredients had been warmed enough, so that the cheese was only partially melted.  The service was good and it isn't their fault that security had to come in and escort a sleeping homeless person out of the booth behind us."

I had the pork belly and duck bao. You get 2 with each order for  $7 an order, I thought it was a bit much for such small bites. Flavors were good on both and I would say the pork belly was a little better. The duck was crispy but all the flavor was in the sauce not from the duck meat. The rest of the menu doesn't have many options but there was a special board I noticed on the way out, it wasn't pointed out when I was handed the menu. The server was very nice and efficient so definitely a plus for service."

I can't describe it. It's crispy on the outside and the pork fat is so flavorful bursting with unimaginable bliss of joy with every bite . The amount of dedication invested in the preparation of this pork belly speaks for itself. Fat Choy really hits the spot when it comes to perfecting their boas. You can tell there was a lot of work put into the pork belly alone to make its so flavorful.  Coming from the San Gabriel Valley area, a place known for one of the best asian cuisines in California, I can say nobody can beat what they have here. I'm a food junkie and chef myself the boas definitely hits my weak spot transitioning from vegetarian to a slow transition to meat. I highly recommend this place because of the heart and soul poured into their dishes. I can definitely taste it with every bite. \n\n\nRECOMMENDATION: REWARDING*****\n\n1. Pork Belly Bao (5++++++++/5) BEST Pork Belly Bao I have ever tasted in my LIFE\n2. Tofu Bao (5+/5), BEST option for Vegetarian Eaters"

Strangest location ever for a great restaurant, in a small casino on Sahara.\n\nWhen we walked in it looked like a burger diner. Red shiny diner seats and booths on the side. Had a cool soda machine, it had push buttons on the machine for different sodas and such. Seemed like they had 12 different sodas. Pretty awesome to see haven't seen that much.\n\nTried a little of everything and tried as many dishes as we could:\n\nShrimp toast with egg was amazing. A simple dish but done perfectly and i was highly impressed\n\nRoasted marrow with toasted bread was cooked perfect. They leave it in the bone of course and its a good serving size especially for marrow. Its not healthy so don't want too much anyway. It tastes amazing on top of the toasted bread.\n\nPork belly and duck boa were both great. Bao's were perfectly cooked and i really can say they did a great job with both dishes. Duck and pork belly were cooked to perfection and flavored just the right amount.\n\nSesame noodles was our last dish and it had the right amount of ingredients and the sesame oil was just the right amount. If you have ever cooked with sesame oil, you know that a little goes a long way and cooking with it is not easy. Dish full of veggies so made me feel a little better and if had the marrow and shrimp toast...healthy eating?\n\nWould have been a 5 star but to me you need that WOW factor and i didn't get it as much as i think a 5 star deserves. Like i said strange location but bring you glock and go enjoy some great food."

Well Fat Choy did that to me. Now I'll be honest, fat Choy isn't a place I would've found normally because it's inside the eureka casino, which is one of those off strip casinos that seem to be filled with the same group of anonymous gamblers. \nThe decor is interesting. It's diner style, lots of interesting pictures and a chalkboard with the daily special\nNow about that food. There's the pork belly BLT, it's exactly what it sounds like, a BLT with pork belly that's so soft and tender that it's  slap yo mama good. The duck bao was money. I found out after that they started off as a food truck selling that, which makes sense. The piece de resistance is the eponymous fat Choy burger. Im gonna just roll call the ingredients, please try to not drool on the screen: half pound patty, short ribs, bacon, egg, onion jam, plus all the regular burger fixings on a soft bun. I demolished that burger quicker than usain bolt does the 100m. \nLong story short, this place is filthy good. I love this place, everyone I brought here loves it. Odds are if you read this far you'll love it too"

I find the food here to very reasonably priced and seriously yummy.\n\nI have been a fan of Great Bao since the beginning. I was a bit dispirited when I found out that they were being kicked out of the hair salon (kind of an awkward location anyway, but that's beside the point.) Good thing they had their truck. I enjoyed visiting their truck almost every time I went to Vegas in the last year (about 7 times.) Nonetheless, when I heard that Great Bao was starting up a brick and mortar restaurant, I was stoked.\n\nMy favorite thing about Great Bao was the fact that they had so many different specials / food choices. Those specials were what kept me going back. Those changes in his menu were kind of a reflection of what he wanted others to taste.\nChef Sheridan having this restaurant somewhat represents the big canvas that the truck and salon just did not have for him to fully express his art in cooking. The menu here is simple, and every dish I tried had so much thought put into it.\n\nI wish I could go into detail about everything I tried, but I'm just going to keep this short and simple. The shrimp toast is a MUST - t'was my favorite item of the meal. The Fat Choy Burger - cooked perfectly medium and SO juicy. The dressing on the side salad is AMAZING. The bone marrow is perfectly cooked, and I like the fact that the bread is grilled. The duck rice, so smokey and tasty. The sesame noodles are quite good as well.\n\nWriting this review is making my mouth water...\n\nI can't wait to go to Vegas again so I can try their pork sauce noodles and pot stickers!\n\nNeedless to say,\n\nLove."

I mean the Eureka Casino is a wretched old haunt with decades of stale smoke and failed dreams layered into its sad old casino floor. Hold your breath and walk straight into the restaurant, where the Fat Choy gang has done a fine job creating a fun, retro vibe. Indeed, the charm of the place is its comfy throw-back appeal. The menu is straight up comfort food--some of it Asian (baos, dumplings, noodles), some of it not even close (burgers, grilled cheese). I love that there's no attempt to \"fuse\" the two together or come up with a clever concept for the coexistence of east and west dishes. The menu is simply a list of wonderfully soulful and homey dishes, end of story. What matters most, of course, is the execution, and Fat Choy gets it right. The pork belly bao is perfection, a brilliant combination of fluffy steamed bun, succulent pork, crispy skin, and a nice bit of tart mustard gremolata. Whoever knows knows that whoever put that together knew what they were doing, with all the parts working together to create a mouth bomb of tastes and textures--soft, luscious, crispy, and bright. The duck in the duck rice has been confit'ed to a melting buttery softness. The short rib grilled cheese may be the absolute ultimate in stoner comfort food. You could fall asleep in that thing and never wake up. I haven't tried everything yet, but everything I have tried has been spot on. I just wrote a review of \"eat,\" where I complained that it over-promises and under-delivers. Fat Choy under-promises and over-delivers! This is unpretentious food prepared with love and passion, and so it needs to be celebrated not just for that reason but because precious few places achieve this level of integrity. The wait staff are always personable and attentive, I should add. I can't think of a more welcoming restaurant, which makes it odd that its located in such an unwelcoming building. Get thee to Fat Choy!"

I was a little surprised when I saw something else. The beef short ribs weren't that good. It was nice and soft but it wasn't worth ordering.  The Sesame Noodles was actually good. The only problem with the noodles was that it was way too spicy that we couldn't finish it. The dumplings came with a salty sauce which made it even more salty - not good. The chicken teriyaki was good but nothing special or out of the ordinary compared to basic chicken teriyaki you can order at any other restaurant. The only thing that was good was the Pork Bao. If I would ever come back to this place (which is most likely never) I would only order the Pork Bao.\n\nThe service:  LACKING.  We came in a group of 7 and they didn't refill any of our drinks until we were done with our food and ready for the check.  We had to flag the server for refills which was almost dumb because the place is small and it wasn't busy when we were there. \n\nOverall, the food isn't enough to make up for the pathetic service that was provided to us. Also, beware of the smell of smoke. We didn't know it was inside a casino and all the smoke from the casino goes into the restaurant. For some who are non smokers this was a huge turn off. Never coming back to this place."

Secret sauce recipe is on the wall! The burgers were so juicy, we needed extra napkins to wipe our fingers and wrists. We also tried the pork belly bao buns, which were a tasty novelty. The pork belly had a good fat to meat ratio and had a nicely crisp exterior. We brought an order of the duck baos for my friend's two kids and they scarfed down the baos so quickly we didn't even get to try a tiny bit! \n\nA few of the positive things about Fat Choy aside from the damn good food - it wasn't pricey (average price for a great burger), there was no wait, the server was experienced, parking was super easy and we didn't get lost once we were inside the casino. The negative - there weren't a lot of customers, so the server disappeared into the kitchen for long stretches of time. I needed a water refill and extra napkins. I ended up draining both glasses of water on the table, before she came back. Since the food we ate was pretty damn good, we would definitely go back and try some of Asian items on the menu!"

So far, we've only been there for lunch, and been pretty empty each time - there's never been more than 3 other tables filled. I'll give restaurants leeway for being slow and inattentive when they're understaffed and busy, but there's always been 2 waitresses and 2 or 3 people in the kitchen.\n\nI think the asian waitress that came over from Great Bao is amazing - friendly, knowledgable on the food and really on it. The other 2 or 3 I've had....not so much. They've given me the wrong order twice despite being it empty, and only having a total of 5 burgers/sandwiches to choose from. This time they got the right food, but they forgot to add the egg to my pbblt - there's always something w/ this place.\n\nWe usually eat there, then I get 2 or 3 separate orders to bring back for my coworkers. Today my VP noticed that the receipt said $9, then magically the total became $10 - see pic. Leave it to a finance guy to notice something like that. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3yRadq4tgXdb_zjDa4KwPA&userid=dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA\n\nSo evidently Fat Choy thinks it's ok to charge $1 for each to go order without telling anyone about it up front, or even listing it on the receipt. With fees - it is what it is, and I have no problem paying it. But I think it's way sheisty and deceitful to slip it in without informing anyone AND hiding it on the receipt. \n\nIt's not printed on the menu and despite what the person on the phone said, no waitress has ever mentioned it to me at any point. I was told that it was clearly posted on the cash register. Which nobody really even pays at because they have waitresses and nothing is ready made, so you end up sitting and waiting for your food regardless of what you order. \n\nYeah it's just effen $1 but since I get separate orders for my coworkers, that has added up over time. I've never understood to-go fees anyway - is it because they don't get tipped for take out orders? It's not about the cost of the box, because you're never charged to take home leftovers, so why would you have to pay $1 for the privilege not to have also dirtied a plate, silverware and cup? \n\nSo whatever, next time I'm just ordering everything for eat in, dirtying plates, then making you bring me boxes for them. And please don't spit in my food because I still gave you 4 stars even though you guys p*ss me off sometimes...."

The stand out was the housemade \"ketchup\" which reminded me more of a thick tomato soup flavor. It was perfect with the cheesy sandwich\n\n-sesame noodles: a tie for my favorite dish on the menu. It's hand pulled egg noodles tossed with vegetables and delicious sauce. For being a noodle dish, it's extremely light and they can even make it vegan using udon noodles\n\n-pork belly bao: the name sake for the truck and it was bomb\n\n-potstickers: a great starter and comes with a housemade soy sauce dipping sauce\n\nLastly, the super nice owners, I had a chance to sit down with co-owner Jenny Wong for an entrepreneur interview and she is kind, welcoming and truly passionate about her business. It's her livelihood and she cares about the customer experience. Definitely go check them out. Don't be off put by Eureka Casino.

Ya know, had they given us another sob story of sorries, we weren't going to even bother a fourth time, but luckily that wasn't the case.\n\nFat Choy is inside of Eureka Casino, a tiny casino some where on Sahara. The only bad experience I had was having to endure the lovely smoke filled casino.\n\nOn the table: Pork Belly Bao, Duck Bao and a noodle dish whose name escapes me but the flavor doesn't!\n\nI'm not a fan of duck bc of the gamey-ness  but I tried the Bao anyway, though I am still not a fan of duck, the Bao was quite tasty! As goes the same for the pork belly, that'd be the one I devoured! Between my husband, son and myself we had a total of 9 Baos and the noodle dish and our bellies were pretty darn content!\n\nOh, for those who have children, yes, they do allow minors in the restaurant but no where else."

            "review": "OMG the pork belly bao and the short rib grilled cheese!  I should just end my review with that statement.  It's all you need to know about this place, seriously.  \n\nWhen in Vegas, my best friend (who is a Vegas native) is always tasked with taking me and the boyfriend on obscure, off the strip dining adventures.  When she and her husband picked us up from our hotel, and drove us to this casino named Eureka, I was skeptical.  First of all, the Casino looks super sketch.  It's tiny, and it's next to a tire center.  They were also remodeling, and they had the bathrooms outside in trailers.  I was ready to get back into the car, and say \"forget about it...\"  They insisted that we would not be disappointed.  So we ventured into this dark and drab Casino, and walked to a tiny restaurant in the back.  I was still skeptical when we got the restaurant, because it looked like it was going to be one of those crappy diners that are open 24 hours, but serve bad food.  It was also empty.  \n\nAnyway, on to the food.  We ordered a variety of things:  The Fat Choy Burger, pork belly bao, short rib grilled cheese, and wonton noodle soup.  The winner of this meal was definitely the short rib grilled cheese.  I know, I know..a grilled cheese sandwich, from a sketchy wannabe Chinese restaurant, at a ghetto casino off the strip...but TRUST me, it was melt in my mouth delicious.  The boyfriend ordered it, and I was green with envy as I watched him polish off the entire sandwich.  The porkbelly bao had these thick slabs of the most tender and juicy porkbelly that I've ever had.  It was also topped with pickled mustard greens, and the flavors just blended so beautifully.  I personally ordered the wonton noodle soup, and when it came out I was disappointed by its appearance, but the moment I tasted the soup, I could tell that this stock was made from bones.  Like, it was some legit noodle broth.   \n\nNow, when I plan my next trip back to Vegas (at the end of this month), I will have Fat Choy on my list.  I must have one of those short rib grilled cheese sandwiches, and I must stuff my face full of porkbelly bao!"

Maybe  something pickled or even a dash of rice wine vinegar.\n\nThe duck rice wasn't that appealing to me because I could easily make something like that at home.

Well at least they now have a brick and mortar location, and I know where to find them.\n\n After reading all these reviews 3 words seemed evident....FAT CHOY BURGER. So we ordered that medium rare, AKA the ONLY way to enjoy a burger, and oh, lookie here..what's this??? a special, that week only 3 bao and a drink special for $10? SOLD! Choices were Roasted Chicken, Tofu, Pork Belly, Peking Duck, and Soft Shell Crab. Not really in a tofu mood, and having pork belly'd well over 50 times, I'm a sucker for soft shell crab, juicy roasted chicken and perfect peking duck, so we went with those.\n\nIt was also my first encounter with the dangerously cool freestyle coke machine. With endless combinations imaginable I came up with a Vanilla Root Beer, and Wifey got a Peach Mello Yello(ask Jenny to make you a Gummy Bear!)\n\nThe Fat Choy Burger did not disappoint and is in my top burgers category. The 3 Bao Special was also great with the crispy skin from the roasted chicken and peking duck, but my favorite bao is the soft shell crab and I would take that over the pork belly any day. Thank you Sheridan and Jenny, your patience and persistence has definitely paid off and I wish you both nothing but continued success!    ALOHA!!!"

It was tender, moist and fresh. One of the best I have had. We also had the Short Rib Grilled Cheese that consists of pulled beef short ribs, onion jam, provolone, cheddar, marinara dip, fries or salad.

Came with a bowl of fried wonton wrapper slices.\n\nThe duck skin in the bao was crisp, but the meat was a little tough, and the dough was a little dense. I still enjoyed them. The potstickers were pan-fried, not deep-fried, which I always appreciate, were flavorful, and had a good sauce.\n\nThe only negative was the service, which was really slow (they did apologize).\n\nCommenting on another yelper's post:  I'm sensitive to cigarette smoke, and I didn't notice any while I was dining."

In particular, the layers of flavor that come with its dishes will first hit you with a bit of Hawaiian flavors from the teriyaki coating, followed by thousand island, and then just the fatty richness of the meat.  Of course, I'm describing the Fat Choy burger, which is one of the best burgers I have ever had.  Additionally, I'm a fan of the pork belly buns that have all the elements of the traditional Peking Duck, but with the added goodness that only pork belly can deliver. \n\nAll in all, Fat Choy is a clean simple restaurant with excellent food and service (thanks Emily!).  I enjoy bringing friends to try Fat Choy, as it quickly becomes a favorite.  The pricing is reasonable and fair.  You will not regret trying Fat Choy."

The pork belly and duck bao was fresh and delicious. The Fluff Ice was there on the day I visited and their ice creations was also good.  However, there seems to be only two employees working the front of the restaurant and the place was busy. Perhaps, it was unexpected for a Sunday but the place seems very busy when I arrived. The two employees working the front was the waitresses/hosts/bus boys/cashiers and I felt bad for them.  I do not know if this is normal for Fat Choy but if it is. I hope Fat Choy seeks out Robert Irvine and his Restaurant Impossible team to get them organized. I do not think Fat Choy is losing money based on the crowd of people on Sunday but I am sure they can make more."

I happened to find myself on the East side of town with a friend and we got our FC on.\n\nFat Choy is located in the Eureka casino. It's a cute little coffee shop tucked in the corner. The place was clean and had bright red, Asian decor in the space. Put waitress was over in a Jiffy. She handed us menus and took our drink order, they have a coca-cola freestyle (a million flavor combos, y'all). My friend and I decided to order a few different things and split them. Our waitress informed us that everything is cooked to order. It takes a bit longer to get the food (nothing excessive), and it's totally worth the wait.\n\nRound 1. Grandma's Potstickers and Wonton Soup.\n\nThe potstickers were fresh and I don't remember the name of the sauce that came with it, but it was divine. Light and with fresh herbs. I can imagine it will go well with just about anything. The wonton soup was also super fresh (you will hear that a lot because it was super, duper fresh). Big pieces of brocoli, thinly sliced carrots, and other yummy veggies, as sprinkled with fresh herbs. A definite must try!\n\nRound 2: The Short Rib Grilled Cheese and Duck Bao.\n\nMay we please have a moment of silence for the Short Rib Grilled Cheese. \n\nThis is one of the most decadent sandwiches around. Gooey cheese, succulent tender shredded short rib. Mouth-gasms, y'all. I recommend sharing this bad boy, it's very, very rich, but oh so good.\n\nThe Duck Boa was served in a deconstructed style; instead of being steamed all together in a bun. The bun was steamed and then folded in half, with crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and seasoned to perfection. Delightful, light and filling. \n\nI recommend going with a friend and sharing a few items. Everything is reasonable priced (about $6 to $10 per item). I cannot praise Fat Choy enough. Great atmosphere, amazing customer service, and top notch grinds. Fat Choy, I'll be seeing you soon."

Pork belly had a nice flavor and the bun was fluffy. Potstickers greasy and the pork inside was very bland. Sesame noodles were light and well cooked. Short rib rice came with two small pieces of short ribs and no sauce so this dish tasted unfinished to me. The teriyaki chicken rice tasted Americanized and the sauce did not taste house made and was bland. On the menu it stated the chicken teriyaki rice came with market vegetables and the short rib rice came with mustard greens. Both actually came with a side salad which was not listed any where on the menu and it made up half the dish. I told the waitress and she said that's how we do things here and the chef thinks it goes better with the side salad instead of the vegetables. I found this response to be odd when the menu said nothing about either item including a side salad. \n\nThe food here is just ordinary, the diner setting is confusing, and Asian & American food is not a combination that works."

For our mains we shared a fat choy burger, duck confit plate and short rib plate. They were all  yum but the duck and burger get major kudos. Go for dessert too!

I was actually surprised at how nice the space looked.  this might be due to the fact i was at Eureka several years ago and the place looked like a dump back then.  Maybe it was a slow day since there was little in the way of smoke.\n\nI went with the short rib grilled cheese and based on the servers recommendation, sourdough bread -  $10 includes fries.  My buddy went with the cheesesteak.  Chuckled at the diet coke served in what had to be a 32 ounce glass beer mug ... do they serve beers in those mugs ?!?\n\nThe grilled cheese was decent - my only beef ( get it ? ) was the short rib meat - it tasted great but it was not spread evenly on the sammie - in fact, almost all of it on one side  - strange.  Fries standard frozen out of a bag and into the fryer.  Have to ding a star for the price .\n\nThe cheesesteak was average but then again, who goes to fat choy for a cheesesteak ? \n\nphoto attached"

            "review": "I have driven past the Eureka Casino a few times and never have given a thought about stopping in.  But, now that Fat Choy is there; I'm going to be a regular.  Hell, I'm going to be the duke of this place.  There is so much on the menu that looked incredible.  And, then to add fluff Ice to the mix... forget it!  Can it get any better, I think not.  The reason that I came was because Shawn put on a UYE here, and many thanks to him for turning me onto this place.  Another thing, Fat Choy is on the East side of town and relatively close to where I live.  That is a huge plus in my book.  So, here was my 5 star experience:\n\nIt took me about 10 minutes to get to the Eureka Casino, where Fat Choy is.  Here's a tip.  Not the best part of town, so make sure you lock your doors and set your alarm.  But, they have a security guard near the parking lot making sure things are kosher.  \n\nMet a group of people and we walked through the casino to get to Fat Choy.  It's a small casino and has a bit of smokiness to it.  Not as bad as I thought it was going to be, but noticeable. But, not at all noticeable in Fat Choy itself. \n\nWe enter Fat Choy and Jennifer, who waited on us, already had a table set up for us.  She was awesome too.  She wanted to make sure we were all happy and went the extra mile.  \n\nWe waited for the rest of our group to show up.  There were 10 or so at our table and we also took over a couple of booths.  We totally took over the place.  \n\nSo, Jennifer came around and took our order and went over it to make sure everything was right.  Told you she went the extra mile.\n\nI had the Fat Choy burger.  Incredible.  Look at the picture I added just for the drool.  I was also looking at the other choices others have made.  And, I will be back to try those too.  \n\nAnd, then the fluff Ice came out.  What a great way to end a meal.  And, we even got a complimentary coffee flavored fluff ice.  Extra mile by everyone at Fat Choy.  5 stars for sure."

And the taxi driver kept saying don't walk outside in that neighborhood, call a taxi when you want to leave, etc., And this was at 11 am on a Sunday morning!  He was so afraid for us!\n\nAs we exited the cab, a security guard came running out and asked our taxi driver if he could take a fare who was drunk, how drunk? Pretty drunk. Is he barfing?  He's already barfed it all out.  Well, I'll guess I'll take him.\n\nUgh!  Nice convo to hear as we are about to go in and order lunch.\n\nWe had the duck bao for a starter (which actually arrived way after our entrees were served) and it was excellent. Our favorite item.  The duck portion was itty bitty tho.  Maybe the size of a half dollar!\n\nI enjoyed the seasme noodles.  The short rib and Mac and cheese grilled sandwich was good but the short rib had no flavor\n\nThe chicken teriyaki was not edible.  It was way too salty.\n\n.....we took our taxi driver's advice and called for a taxi (he gave us their number) and no answer.  We put our big girl panties on, and  walked to the SLS, about three long blocks, and stood in their taxi line.\n\nWe went to Fremont Street from there."

Like another reviewer, I sat as far from the entrance to the casino, and the fragrance of tobacco smoke still reached me and affected my meal. That was the only negative. The food was fantastic. Really great wonton soup, seemed made by hand very recently, very fresh. I had a pork belly BLT sandwich. I assumed that meant substituting pork belly for bacon, but no, it was BOTH pork belly and bacon, plus lettuce, tomato, and unique mayo. Pure heaven comfort food. I could not stop giggling with happiness after the first bite. Our waitress was super engaging and sweet with our kids. Very small restaurant, very reasonable prices.

I absolutely love and sort of Asian fusion so I got super excited as I read through the reviews and looked at the photos - I bookmarked it right away and told my bf we were coming here for dinner! \n\nWe followed the directions and winded up at such a random location - Eureka Casino  (a stand alone casino in a not so great part of town) hahahah. But we were like we gotta see what this hype is about!!! So we went into this small casino and there it was, Fay Choy. It looked like an old, diner-style restaurant with old school diner booths. Interesting ambiance to say the least. Anyway, the waitress handed us menus and we could decide what to get cos there was so much I wanted to try. We ended up getting an order of the Pork Belly Bao (YUM) ugh so nommy. The bao was perfectly made. Some restaurants mess up and make the bao a little too dry, or flaky, but here it was perfect! We also got the Braised Short Rib Grilled Cheese..... Omg my love for grilled sandwiches got even stronger after this one!! I mean, I LOVE short rib and I LOVE grilled cheese so when I saw this as one thing I had to get it!! My boyfriend got the Fat Choy burger, this was good too but not the bessst burger in town, still good tho! Our experience was great, service was awesome. Definitely will be coming back to try more!! \n\nDon't be intimidated by its location!"

            "review": "If you're into cars, you're familiar with the concept of price-independent vs. price-dependent reviews.  For example: is the new Corvette better than the current Ferrari Italia?  On a price-independent basis, pffft, not even close.  But the price-dependent verdict?  Absolutely!  Is Fat Choy a better restaurant than, say, Joel Robuchon?  Uh ... NO.  But when you factor in price, yeah, I'll say yes, it is, because the average tab per person (tax and tip included) at Fat Choy is $15-20 whereas the average cost per head at Joel Robuchon is 25 quadrillion dollars (OK, slight exaggeration).\n\nThe quality of the food at Fat Choy is very good.  When you consider the bang-for-your-buck, Fat Choy is off the charts.  Where else in Las Vegas, or anywhere in America for that matter, can you get roasted bone marrow for $8 or duck confit for $12?  Those are the two menu items that I put in the gourmet category; the other two categories are Asian fusion and American standards.  I'm not a big fan of bone marrow; it's just a bit too rich and the flavor too strong for my tastes.  That said, I did think the one bite I got when my cousin ordered it was pretty good.  My cousin (who finished off every last bit of the marrow) was flabbergasted by the price, insisting that for a bone that large, he would expect to pay $20 at least.  But I am a huge fan of duck confit, and at Fat Choy, it's as good as I've had it anywhere else, with the bonus of an astonishingly low price.\n\nIn the Asian category, my favorite is the pot stickers.  It always baffed me that pot stickers are on every single Chinese restaurant menu in America because I've never much cared for them.  But wow, I love the pot stickers at Fat Choy.  The wrapper isn't gummy or rubbery like in every Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten in, and the filling is leaner and more savory.  My other favorites are the sesame noodles and the fried pork sauce noodles.  The sesame noodles feature some mushrooms (I forgot which variety) that add a delicious layer of flavor to the sesame.  If you let the fried pork sauce sit for a couple of minutes, the noodles absorb all the deliciousness of the fried pork.  Both baos are great, pork belly and duck.  For a foodie on a budget (describes me to a T), the Peking duck bao is a real gourmet treat.  Again, how many places in Las Vegas, or anywhere else, can you enjoy gourmet quality for seven bucks??\n\nThe menu category I don't much care for is the American standards.  Don't get me wrong, they're done OK.  It's just that I don't like that kind of food.  But if chicken wings, spaghetti & meatballs, and cheesesteaks are right up your alley, you'll be satisfied at Fat Choy.\n\nMuch has been made of the smoke issue inside the Eureka Casino, which was described in a local magazine as the kind of casino where chain-smoking gamblers are surgicaly grafted to their favorite slot machines.  To borrow from the immortal wisdom of Bart Simpson: It's funny because it's true.  Fat Choy recently got a smoke-eater system, which has helped tremendously with the smoke issue.  I'll admit, I used to get pretty bothered at times by the smoke blowing in from the casino.  If you're extremely smoke-sensitive, the smoke-eaters might not be enough.  Actually, if you're extremely smoke-sensitive, you'll never survive the walk through the casino to get to the restaurant.  But for me, the smoke issue is now a non-issue.\n\nThe very short walk through the smokey casino is well worth it.  Besides great food at astonishingly low prices, Fat Choy has a passionately committed executive chef, Sheridan Su, and a terrific, warm, and friendly (genuine warmth & friendliness, in Las Vegas?) staff headed up by general manager Jenny Wong.  For any foodie, a trip to Fat Choy is a good idea.  For a foodie on a budget, it's an absolute must."

After checking Yelp, I was surprised to see that many of my Yelp Elite friends have already visited this place and have given them top notch reviews. I really trust the opinions of my Yelp comrades, so I knew I was going to love this place. \n\nI was surprised to find that this place was located in the middle of a run down casino called Eureka. Walking through the casino, I thought I was going to have a disappointing time. When we entered the diner, my spirits lifted. Nice read diner booth seating, bar tops and tables were ample for all sorts of parties. Our server was very thorough. When she carded us for the alcohol ordered, she asked us questions about our ID's. It was different, but appreciated. She also went through some kind of spiel about the place, but talked so fast, I wasn't able to catch what she was saying. \n\nFor our meals, I decided to get the two recommended items: Peking Duck Bao and The Pork Belly Bao for $7 each. HOLY EVERYTHING THAT IS HOLY! These baos blew me away and really surprised me. The Peking Duck Bao: duck in an open faced steamed bun, cucumbers, scallions and hoisin sauce. The duck was perfectly cooked and flavored nicely. The cucumber and scallion brought a nice crunchy element and the hoisin brought a nice BBQ sweet flavor. What an AH-MAZE-ING dish. What's more amazing was the Pork Belly Bao: Fried pork belly, pickled mustard greens, cilantro and crushed peanuts. The belly was marbleized and perfectly fried. The peanuts helped to break up the marbleized meat. The cilantro and greens helped to bring an herb and very slightly bitter element. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE BAOS FOREVER AND EVER! \n\nWOW, what an awesome culinary experience. I was more surprise that this gem of a place was located in an older casino building. It truly is your treasure to find. I'm definitely coming back. VERY SOON."

The pork was crunchy but super salty (hello, hypertension!).  They could've added more sauce to neutralize the saltiness 3.5/5\n\nShrimp Toast:\n$8 gets you a piece of toast with shrimp, Chinese sausage and a fried egg on top.  It was good.  But not $8 good. You can get shrimp toast at most Chinese restaurants for half the price  3/5\n\nBone Marrow:\n$8 of fatty goodness with good onion jam on top.  5/5\n\nI usually don't pay attention to the price when it comes to food.  But today I had to.  I think Fat Choy is overrated and overpriced for what I get and where I'm getting it from.  I can understand paying $8 for shrimp toast if I were in Bellagio or Wynn.  I can get 3 pieces of bao from somewhere else for the same price.  The concept is great but needs to be improved before I can come back again.

My sis, who does live there, is a fan of their baos (I find always find it funny to hear white people say \"bao\"), and since Fat Choy was listed as one of the 38 must-go restaurants in Vegas by some website, she took me there on my recent visit.\n\nWe had the duck bao, pork belly bao, and short rib rice.  Both baos were delicious. However, I'm from the Bay Area where we have constant access to Chinatown so bao is not a unique thing.  You can't really ever go wrong with roast duck, so while the duck bao was great, it was no better than any other duck bao I've had throughout my life.  A generous piece of delicious boneless duck in a steamed chinese bun with a bit of greens, drizzled with hoisin sauce.  Yummy but for $7 for 2 pcs, the price was kinda ouch.  I can get half a roasted duck at a chinese bbq restaurant for less than that.  Still, for the non-Asians in Vegas, I can understand the hype if you've never had something like this.  And I do definitely recommend trying it if you never have.\n\nI was more impressed with pork belly, but that's only because that's rarer where I come from.  It was done so well.  Exactly what pork belly should be and far superior to the pork belly dishes I've had at higher-end trendy Asian fusion restaurants.  \n\nThe short rib rice was great as well.  I wouldn't call it generous but it was enough.  The short ribs were incredibly tender and seasoned wonderfully.  I was afraid it would taste like nothing more than pot roast (which we make at home all the time in the crock pot and which similar beef entrees at a lot of restaurants end up tasting like even though they call it fancier names).  But the ribs surpassed my expectations.  Came over white rice with a side of salad (with the fancy greens--not the cheap lettuce) and some chopped pickled mustard.  That pickled mustard added a lot to the dish for both my sister and me.  If you're not familiar with it, I'm not sure that you'd really appreciate it though.  \n\nI honestly don't know that I would go back myself because, as I said, I have access to similar types of food here in the Bay Area and at much cheaper prices.  But I might if I lived in Vegas.  One downside is that since it's in a casino, you can smell the cigarette smoke if you're sitting close to the entrance, and it can be pretty bad.  I am so glad California is more prissy about smoking.\n\nThe service was really friendly.  Both servers were sweet.  Another yelper said there is a mandatory 15% tip, but I don't think that's true.  When you pay on their tablet credit card swiper, there is a button you can press to add 15%, 20%, or 25% tip, but you don't HAVE to press any of them.  \n\nThey also had a nice selection of dessert, including root beer floats!  I bought a red velvet cake home for my white boyfriend.  I didn't try it but he liked it. He said it wasn't as sweet as other velvet cakes he's had."

And after reading these reviews, I was prepared to hit a wall of smoke and smell like I was in a casino for eight hours when we got there.  Soooo, not the case.  If you are uber sensitive to smoke, you can barely smell it here?????  So, don't let those reviews throw you off.  (Unless they were there on a Saturday night, busy weekend or tourist season!)  The parking lot is fine?  Lighted, security guy, it's not the ghetto, people?  Grow a set, will ya?  Park in the lot, go in the back entrance and the restaurant is on the right.  You barely walk through the casino.  We went on a Tuesday night, non-tourist season and the place was dead.  (Casino too).  This place would do so much better at an upscale casino or even a strip shopping center.  Cause, honestly, the casino is crap.  But the restaurant is GREAT!   American-Asian. Diner set up with counter and booths.  Super casual.  Our waitress was Emily and she was an absolute doll.  Friendly, professional, cool...perfect service.  Now the food - I'll be going back again and again.  We (four of us) ordered the duck bao, the port belly bao, duck fried rice, pot stickers, and sesame noodles with pork belly - you can get chicken, Chinese sausage, or just the noodles.  Everything was delicious.  Not only was the chef on Diners Drive In and Dives, but Chopped too.  And he rules.  Everything was so good.  The noodles had a spicy kick - and I could eat them every day.  The Bao, with their steamed buns - so fresh, so tasty.  They are listed under the \"Snack\" part of the menu - you get two and it's a great start for the huge bowl of noodles you get or the serving of duck fried rice.  Great portions.  First time having pork belly and c'mon it's in the bacon family - you can't go wrong.  This place rocks you have to give it a try."

Drive Inn, Diners and Dives must come check this place out! \nWe got the famous Pork Belly Fat and Crispy Roast Duck Baos 2 Baos for $7 also the amazing Short Rib grill cheese sandwich $10 with some crispy thin fries. One bite of this crispy, cheesy yummy goddess will send you to fat boy heaven. Ask for some their ranch (which is so good) and you won't believe that you are eating something so good...yes it exist! Home made pot stickers so good you can tell it's made in house....(or someone's house LOL) it was crispy and tender just the way I like my pot stickers cooked, and it comes with an awesome dipping sauce. Fat Choys Chicken with rice is their version of a Teriyaki bowl also yum. Washed it all down with a cold Lucky Buddha beer. Fun, clean Chinese American diner with amazing food. Easy carefree place with good food, you just gotta hold you breath and make it through the smoke in the casino. Good thing you can book it straight from the front door to the Resturant in 5 seconds. Specials like the soft shell crab bao, fat belly BLT and the Fried Pork noodles are only offered for a limited time and you can get notices when by following them on Twitter and or Facebook."

The Fat Choy Burger! This wonderful creation is made up of half a pound of angus beef, short rib, bacon, fried egg, cheddar cheese, and a fried tomato. \n\nNot only did we get the Fat Choy Burger, but we also were intrigued by the choices of Bao Sliders that were on the menu. We got the any 3 plus a drink for 10 bucks deal. We picked the pork belly, peking duck, and for a limited time only, soft shell crab!\n\nService was awesome. Our server was constantly checking up on us. \n\nAs a bonus, Fluff Ice was there as a temporary pop up to see how people will react with the Fat Choy collaboration. We ordered a medium halo halo and a chocolate crunch. Just the sheer silence of my kids told me that they approve of the fluff ice!\n\n5 stars for all of the above mentioned. Minus one star for the glaring issue they need to address. THE FREAKIN SECOND HAND SMOKE COMING IN FROM THE CASINO!

I guess this owner has some pretty good tastes.\n       - Area - So this place isn't in the greatest part of town. It's in what use to be a diner in a rinky dink casino. The casino is smokey, but the dining area isn't too bad.\n       - Decor - Once you get to the restaurant, it feels very cozy. It has a diner feel with Asian decorations that seemed like an afterthought.\n       - Food truck - I believe this restaurant is owned by the same owners as the Great Bao. I never actually tried the food truck, but there's paintings on the walls that point to this fact.\n**Ordered**\n       - $10 Fat Choy Burger - I don't even know where to explain how great this burger is. Braised short rib, bacon, egg, and special sauce on a burger patty. The braised short rib they put on the 1/2 burger patty is the perfect saltiness that it almost renders the bacon redundant. Yes, I know. I said it. It was better than bacon. It is the perfect blend of salty meats, juicy burger, gooey yolk, and sweet Asian sauce to make me want to come back again. It came with fries, but the fries were just ehh.\n       - $8 Shrimp Toast - First time I've had this anywhere and it's hard to describe. It's egg, chopped up sausage, and some kinda sauce on top of a toast. It sounds super weird, but once you bite into it, it all makes sense. It's like those seafood toast things at buffets, but way better.\n       - $7 Peking Duck Bao - They come in pairs and they're just like the Peking Duck you'd get at an authentic Chinese wedding. The only difference is usually it's mostly duck skin. This is a lot more meatier. It's delicious.\n       - $9 Pork Noodles - Dry noodles with chopped up pork on it for flavor. They were excellent. The minced pork was just salty enough to complement the slightly sweet noodles and not overpower it.\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a unique Asian Fusion place. It's a hole in the wall, but it's also a gem."

It was messy and sloppy and all over my plate and the egg oozed all over, just like how any good burger should be. The fries were fine, crunchy and seasoned. The only negative things were that the burger could've been seasoned better and cooked better.\n\nThe food left me in a coma and makes me want to take a nap. I recommend Fat Choys."

I've been wanting to check out the Eureka Casino anyway....one of those solidly un-pretentious little locals' dumps that will doubtlessly be imploded any day now. Well, after having checked it out...IMPLODE AWAY, I SAY!\n\nEverything in this restaurant is coated in/soaked in/bathed in/wallowing in grease. My friend and I shared the pot stickers as an appetizer -- they were OK, although also glistening with gratuitous grease. As far as pot stickers go...they were like any other potstickers. Except greasier. All the better to slide down your gullet, I guess.\n\nNext, I had the much-ballyhooed Short Ribs Grilled Cheese. BLEECCCHHHHH doesn't even begin to describe this monstrosity! I thought the pot stickers were greasy -- this beast was OFF THE CHAIN GREASY! It was like eating a heavily-salted Jheri curl sandwich!! I don't like wasting food, so I managed to choke down half of it before giving up -- but it was G.R.O.S.S. It was SO salty it was almost like they were trying to cover something up. Also, the grease had a weird sort of stale aftertaste, like they use the same fry oil over and over. YUCK! \n\nThe fries that accompanied the sandwich were similarly greasy. I know, I know, French fries are called FRIES because they are FRIED -- but these were ridiculous. I've had better fries in the employee dining room at Caesars Palace! The fry grease had the same gross aftertaste as the sandwich, which totally killed whatever was left of my appetite.\n\nNow, you might chalk all of this up to my being a veggie-eating commie bastard -- but guess what? My friend, who is most definitely NOT a veggie-eating commie, had the Fat Choy burger...and was similarly grossed out. He reported that it, too, was astonishingly greasy -- although he did finish the whole thing, so it couldn't have been THAT bad.\n\nYou might blame me for not having ordered something less greasy than a grilled cheese -- but the menu is extremely limited here (one page only), and since I don't like duck or pork, I didn't want to get the highly-touted bao or any of the rice dishes. I'm willing to bet they are just as greasy, anyway :-/ In fact, there wasn't much of anything on the menu that grew out of the ground -- it was all lard, grease, carbs and meat.\n\nWhat really sucks is, I came in here fully expecting to adore the place -- being as it's located in such a solidly unpretentious dive. Speaking of which.....\n\nAfter I gave up on eating, and had sopped the grease off my face with no fewer than thirty napkins, I went out into the casino to have a drink at the bar, thinking I could salvage the evening with a little people-watching and a rum & coke to cut through the grease still coating my tongue. But even that went sadly awry.\n\nFirst of all, it's a cash-only bar, and I didn't have any on me. So I had to get raped by the corner ATM, and pay a $5 surcharge...which brought the cost of my drink up to Strip prices anyway. If I'm paying Strip prices, dammit, I want to at least be able to ogle drunk bitches with fake tits, etc. But all I got was a depressing, smoke-filled room full of methheads, with Kenny Loggins playing somewhere in the background. That kind of ambiance is OK if you're in a certain mood....\n\n...but when you're already on the verge of vomiting, it ain't no fun! I finished my drink and got the fuck out of there, probably never to return. \n\nI never thought I'd say this, but...there are some places that DESERVE to be imploded. You hear that, Tony Hsieh?!! Blow this bitch sky-high and have at it -- even an elitist members-only dog park would be better than THIS!!!"

I think this dish was made for me, anything that combines Bacon and Pork Belly can never be wrong!\n\nShortrib Grilled Cheese: This was probably the dish of the meal (I will be having of these in my future). The Shortrib is cooked to perfection, with enough cheese to balance, but not overpower. And the onion Jam served on the side complimented the sandwich perfectly.\n\nFried Pork Sauce Noodles: Noodles with pork belly. The noodles had a bit of spice to them, and the pork belly was cooked to perfectly. It was a touch spicy for me, but still a great dish.\n\nDuck Rice: Hands down the best dish of the meal, A quarter duck (leg and thigh) served with rice. The duck was succulent (they told me it's a 2 day process for the duck to be made), and the garlic rice goes well with the richness of the duck. \n\nThe Location is not too big (but way bigger than the old shop), there are a bunch of TVs, and a bar as well. I highly recommend you check it out! Well done Chef Sheridan and crew."

I didn't believe her at first but when I had it a few years back, I had to make sure that anytime I'm in Las Vegas, I have to visit this restaurant just for their baos.  This isn't my first time here and it will not be my last. The service can be a little slow, and the smell of smoke is a little much but I don't mind any of it as long as I get an order of their pork belly bao and Peking duck bao. \n\nPork belly bao and Peking duck bao:  They are both very good and flavorful. I do prefer the pork belly bao over the duck because there's more meat on the pork belly. I've had the tofu and mushrooms bao in the past and it was pretty tasty for a vegetarian dish.  If I could eat a lot of these, I would in a heartbeat.  The bun is nice and soft, there's enough sauce and lots of different textures in the dish. I love it!  \n\nSesame noodles:  I was surprised that I liked this dish. It had a great peanut sauce/flavor. The noodles were cooked nicely and had a great bite to them. There was a good amount of chopped up vegetables and sauce in this dish. It was enough to share as well. \n\nPork belly BLT with fries:  the fries were excellent - crispy and soft. If that's even possible. There was enough pork belly and bacon in this sandwich. The sourdough bread was amazing. It was buttered nicely and it was crispy. Overall it was a really good sandwich. \n\n5 stars for the baos and basically that's what the 5 stars are for.  Oh and the prices are pretty good for the amount of food that you get."

            "review": "Fat Choy is another promising restaurant from Sheridan Su but at least with this first visit, I'm not sure I was totally sold on the concept or the food.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is a weird mish mash of items from a really classic diner feel mixed with some food truck trappings.  Perhaps it was the location itself (the Eureka Casino) that also didn't help - Fat Choy is tucked away near the front entrance's left corner, but the really smoky interior and odd smells make for an odd first impression.  \n\nMenu-wise, there's a mix of diner and Chinese food here from breakfast to late dinner.  There's also some beer and wine options available with some dessert as well.  I opted for the Fat Buddha beer and the short rib rice bowl.  The beer was about $5 and the bowl was about $14.  The bowl came with the short rib, some mixed greens (with a choice of sauce), rice and a choice of an added egg for extra.  There's another sauce mixed in here as well which probably had the best impression - being tangy and a little sour.  The rest of the dish however was just okay.  The short rib tasted a little off to me for some reason (not that tender) and the bowl dish from the rice to the salad were fairly bland.  The egg helped the most and I wish I mixed the yolk in more with the rice for instance to make for a better dish.  \n\nService was also a little hit-or-miss for me.  I waited in the front for about 10 minutes before being helped (didn't see any staff) although after being seated, service seemed to be smoother with a shorter wait on food.  \n\nI'm totally wiling to give the restaurant another try (after trying the really delightful Flock & Fowl) but at least the first go-around was a little ho-hum."

Hey it's great to have friends write puff reviews but in the long term it truly does Sheridan a disservice.\n\nFirst, the good- the Pot Stickers. Yes, they were good and tasty. But once the order was placed they took 30 minutes to come out  and there were only a handful of people in the restaurant.  Plus I saw Sheridan AND another cook in the kitchen.  Does this neighborhood really support five small Pot Stickers selling for seven bucks?\n \nThis is my major beef with Fat Choy, there is a total disconnect with the menu and the neighborhood. Examples: They open for breakfast at 8am...this is a working class area...the working class is at work at 8am...also, pancakes and eggs sell for eight bucks...again maybe that works but not here. How about a breakfast special to draw people in...this is not Robuchon's...\n\nBack to the meal. I ordered  beer and I believe they brought me something close to a 40oz...I laughed...largest bottled beer I have ever had with dinner...who came up with that...\n\nPork Belly BLT....I was excited to try this, unfortunately the pork belly was more like bacon bits...there were hardly any there...I asked for extra sriracha mayo and there was not enough to even taste...and the bread was totally soaked in grill grease...absolutely brutal execution...\n\nPlease understand I want nothing but success for Sheridan. But I have never walked out of a restaurant feeling the owner had such a disconnect with concept and presentation as what Sheridan has done with Fat Choy. An intervention is needed without which Fat Choy will be gone by June."

I've been paying extremely high prices for crappy Excalibur casino food the last 3 days, I am ecstatic that I found such an amazing place serving such incredible food. Pork Bao sliders are unlike anything else you have ever placed in your mouth, and the chicken wings were juicy, fresh, and made to order. My friend requested some more spicy than normal and the staff graciously honored his request, and the result was a perfectly fried, juicy, succulent, hot saucy wing... perfection!!! My friend travels to Vegas regulary, and had lived here before and had never been to the casino that holds Fat Choy's, said he had never even heard of it. But I made a believer out of him today.

Their burger did not disappoint...  If you fancy yourself a burger aficionado, you must try theirs!\n\nFat Choy is a Chinese fusion diner tucked away in the Eureka casino.  The unassuming ambience did not undermine my experience...\n\nWhat is in the burger?  1/2 lb burger patty, braised short rib, cuts of bacon, subtle sweet sauce, fried egg, and a sweet bun (?).  Also comes with lettuce and tomato.  \n\nEnough short rib but not overpowering the patty--good balance.  \n\nCrispy cuts of bacon adds a crunchy texture on some bites.  Many burgers that come with bacon don't serve crispy bacon.  Instead you take a bite and hope you shear of a clean piece of bacon, but what usually happens is you can't bite off the bacon and end up eating almost the entire strip of bacon in that one mouthful.  Fat Choy cooks the bacon to a crisp and cuts the bacon into squares.  No need to battle with the bacon for a bite sized piece.  While  bacon is not listed on the menu description of the burger, I found the crunchy texture to be a wonderful surprise.    \n\nThe color of the bun was either a potato or a sweat bread bun.  Bun--sweet and soft.  My favorite type of bun...\n\nIn many ways, a perfect burger...\n\nService was terrific. Diane was friendly, outgoing, and charismatic. Askd many times how i was doing...  \n\nI am definitely returning to Fat Choy on future visits to Vegas.  I might even try other options such as the pork belly bao which is highly touted in many reviews..."

The little hamster in my head was all giddy when I read that there is kalbi and bacon in a burger. When I think of Kalbi I think of Korean short ribs so naturally I was thinking I'd get a nice slab of BBQ goodness in the bun. No the case here, the kalbi was more like bulgogi or Korean brisket. It was tasty but not what I was expecting so it didn't taste right in my mind. Don't get me wrong, the burger was decent just not what my brain and taste buds had a major conflict. Thinking about it now, I am not too sure but I didn't taste any onion jam or secret sauce either. I recall some thousand island (oops) dressing on the bun though. \nLike I said no major wow factor on this one for me. This one didn't kick me in the mouth nor make me wanna slap my momma.. \n\nFor some reason my brain and taste buds got in sync for this one. \nThe grilled cheese was AWESOME!

I think I may have to dethrone Babystacks' Kalua Pig Grilled cheese and make this concoction king of grill cheese in my mental kingdom!. \nThe marinara sauce on the side was a great touch.

The menu is condensed but they clearly have tasted all the food and can give you a great recommendation. \n\nThe first visit I tried the potstickers, duck bao and sesame noodles. The potstickers were good although the sauce was a little harsh for me. I really enjoyed the duck bao, clearly the chef has spent time finding what additions and condiments compliment the duck best. The sesame noodles were basic but not in a boring way. A nice hearty dish that's good after a long day of work.\n\nMy second visit I tried the pork belly bao and the short rib grilled cheese. Both of these were absolutely delicious. The pork bao is savoy and the crushed peanuts are a unexpected welcome addition. What can I say about the short rib grilled cheese? AMAZING.

Its certainly not the nicest part of town (and that is putting it nicely), but in a way this is something that I liked about the space.  Its in the heart of the city, and like any city not all of it is pretty and glamorous.  Also, rest assured, the parking lot is well lit and there is a good security presence such things go awry.\n\nOnce inside Fat Choy, it does a decent job establishing its own unique brand outside of the normal casino cafe.  The room has personality that matches its menu.  Our waitress was nice and had a lot of knowledge about the menu.  She recommended the Pork Bao, the duck fried rice, and the special - bone marrow.  I happily ordered all three.\n\nThe Pork Bao, a delicious piece of pork wrapped in dough and smothered in relish and peanuts was something out of food lover's day-dream.  The moment I took my first bite I forgot everything about the seedy casino we were sitting in.  I was instantly happy with my choice to dine here.  And I quickly asked for another order as soon as she could bring it.\n\nThe duck fried rice was a wonderful mix of rice, perfect duck leg, and salad greens.  I ordered it with a fried egg on top, again from the waitresses recommendation.  Really good flavors.\n\nLastly, the bone marrow.  I'd read you had to order it when it was on special, and I followed direction.  It was much better than I though, a half-ox bone cooked well and smoothed in sauce.  It comes with a side of fresh toast to spread the marrow on.  It was meatier than I expected, with FULL flavor.  Surprising and unique.\n\nI plan on coming back just for this bright gem.  If you want to try something new, brave the location and give this a try."

The place is nice for been inside eureka one of the older casinos here it's safe it's not shady but of course like old buildings it might have a smell to it for some but not me , oh and the staff was awesome !

We got sesame noodles, duck bao, and the short rib grilled cheese\n\nSesame noodles: I kind of expected the flavor to be a little more subtle. There's actually a lot going on in this bowl. Once you start eating it, it gets a addicting and you just want some more.\n\nShort rib grilled cheese: I was probably most excited for this one. I really liked the combination of the buttery bread and salty meat, but I do think tht the meat was a little too salty.\n\nDuck bao: I absolutely love duck. It looks very simple but when you bite into this one, it's something else. The duck was a little too crispy, but it was still great and really went well the the outside part cause it was so soft.\n\nThe service: our waitress was so nice! She made sure we were satisfied and added little tidbits. I really loved how friendly she was. She gave a great vibe.\n\nIf you want good cheap food with an awesome atmosphere you need to come try this place."

Funny enough same thing happened to Bobby, Misti, Mamie and her hubby that they were here too! Hey! \n\nWhat a funny name though. I know most people will think Fat Choy as in the Chinese New Year greeting \"Gung Hay Fat Choy\" or maybe a cheeky nickname for someone chubby but I think of the literal translation \"hair vegetable\" which is a type of moss put in some Chinese foods. Not as cute, but also pretty tasty.\n\nThe menu is solid sounding, it was hard to decide on what to try. That is promising to me that the whole menu is well thought out I couldn't zoom into just one thing easily. We settled on sharing two things as we had a early dinner to catch though I would have loved a appetizer or dessert. \n\nShort rib rice bowl - this was braised bone in and was tender. They gave us two generous ribs that cooked in a sauce that reminds me much of Filipino adobo. It was a tiny bit salty for me, but I don't think it is ridiculously so. They give you a bit of salad with balsamic dressing and pickled mustard greens to go with it. It was good, but I don't know if it was $14 good. This doesn't seem like a neighborhood that drops that kind of money so I don't know how this will play out with the local patron traffic vs the foodies who will seek this out. \n\nPork sauce noodles - I really liked this. The ground pork and diced tofu mixture is cooked in a hoisin-ish type sauce and thrown with some shredded carrots, cucumbers and sprouts. It reminds me of dan dan noodles, but I think I liked this better. I would definitely get this one again. \n\nService was nice, but wasn't the best. The BF ordered soda and really thought it was stale tasting and let the server know and she just took it away and never offered anything else and I still had to pay for it. They give you a bottle Eureka water for free if you ask for ice water, but I never got a refill on my empty water. It took a while to be able to order and had to walk up to the counter to get our check and be on our way. It wasn't really busy and there were two ladies working the floor so I feel it should have been a bit better. \n\n I wouldn't ever think to come to the Eureka and is still kind of a weird bare cafeteria-esque space, but this is a more comfortable spot than their previous incarnation in a salon in that there is seating. I am not overly smoke sensitive, but the smoke smell is strong on the casino floor and the restaurant opens out so it may be bothersome to sensitive noses. \n\nI see some promise of well made eats so I will be back for more Fat.\n\n(Yelp 100 Challenge 34/100)"

It's not a five star place, but it still does the trick for the most part.\n\nI've been wavering with Fat Choy for a while now, and while it's not the best, it's a good restaurant that I'd recommend for pork belly items. Otherwise, the dishes tend to range from OK to pretty good. For example, the Fat Choy burger (which I finally tried last year) doesn't compare to other similarly priced restaurant burgers that I've eaten in Las Vegas, and the rice dishes that I've ordered didn't dazzle my taste buds either.\n\nToday, I visited specifically to try some of their lunch specials. The soft shell crab bao ($9) was the first order. While the namesake component was certainly a delicious and crunchy treat (and might-I-add visually impressive), the sauces were uninspired and the ratio skewed toward bready. I can't help but contrast this with the mouthfuls of meat in Chef Sheridan's other creations.\n\nI was going to try the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, but instead I went with what turned out to be the last pastrami melt ($10). I hope they didn't skimp because it's definitely not one of those sandwiches piled high with pastrami, or cheese even. The ingredients all tasted great though, and the crunchy bread was essential for texture. The massive side order of fries (included in the price) was pretty good, although I suspect that the broad salt flakes created an uneven seasoning situation. Overall, it's at least a notch below a great sandwich-focused shop that recently reopened in the Arts District.\n\nFat Choy is still a good restaurant to visit from time to time (for pork belly), but it's clear that Jenny and Chef Sheridan have brought a better game with their chicken-centric lunch spot Flock and Fowl just a few blocks away."

But, and this is a disappointing \"but\", both the pancakes and waffle were confusingly chewy. This, we could only guess, seemed to be because they were not made fresh? Not sure. \n\nSo, definitely some tasty vittles to be had, but still not as exceedingly fantastic a five star review would imply. Struggled to decide between staying three star or going up a star.

It was a Thursday night at 6:00. \n\nFacility: The restaurant is located in a mediocre casino called Eureka. It looks like an American diner, almost 50's-ish, but at closer inspection, it has some modern Asian influences too. Fairly clean and pretty small. It has booth seating, tables and chairs, and bar stool counter seats. Unfortunately, the smoke from the casino leaked enough into the restaurant to make my hair smell like old smoke when we left. :/ \n\nService: Well, this is hard to say nicely. The service was ok, but our waitress seems a little confused. That's a nice word. Confused. Anyway, she was nice enough, and was awesome at remembering the drinks for refills, which with their 100+ combinations of sodas, that's impressive. Yeah Diet Dr Pepper!!!!\n\nFood: I shared everything with my Girl, so we had 3 dishes. \nPork Belly Bao - 4/5 - yum!  The meat was good and the condiments accented it nicely. The bun was fresh and soft. \nDuck Bao - 5/5 - This was my fav. I really loved the cucumber topped onto the salty, rich duck. It was so good!!\nShort rib grilled cheese with fries - 3/5 - this was a good sandwich. The grilled cheese portion was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crisp to the bread. The filling was shredded shortrib, melted with cheese and topped with an onion jam. I did get a few pieces of onion peel that were inedible, but it did add some sweetness to the sandwich. There was a side of tomato jam that more resembled marinara sauce. I used it for my fries. Fries were average tasting, but they are hot and fresh. \n\nOverall: This was a good restaurant. I would come back again with friends. I will make sure I have nothing to do after a because of the smokey hair and clothes. \nBut the Bao is yum!!"

The prices are reasonable,  the service is EXCELLENT,  and the food is really good.  Fresh, quality ingredients are used. \n\nExample: Wonton Soup. I didn't find any gristle in my wontons! The \"pi\" wrapper was the good thin type. ..not the cheap, thick style!  The water chestnuts were chopped so finely that they were a pleasant texture instead of an obvious big nuisance! The broth had a mild, but complex flavor. ..not a salty assault! \n\nAlso enjoyed the Peking Duck Bao and the Potstickers with its crisp edges and Ginger Scallion dipping sauce. ..they were yummy!

She asked me about being there before and if I had any questions about the menu.  She was very helpful and very personable.  I was the only customer on this slow Sunday evening, and she had extra time and she spent it checking back with me a chatting.\n\nI had looked at the menu online and I opted to try the bao.  I've never had Vietnamese bun bao so this was a new experience.  I ordered the duck and pork belly bao.  The duck bao comes with thinly sliced cucumber pieces, scallion, micro greens, and hoisin sauce.  The pork belly bao comes with one side of the pork seared, pickled mustard greens, cilantro, hoisin sauce, and some crushed peanuts.\n\nThe sandwiches were great!  The duck was my favorite because I simply love duck.  Jenny had brought me Sriracha and a small plate for putting the Sriracha and then using the plate as a dipping area.  It worked quite well!  The bun was very tasty.\n\nThen the option came for dessert.  What's a person to do?  Ask Jenny for advice and certainly follow it.  I got the peanut butter cup which has a chocolate cookie-like bottom, then a layer of peanut butter mousse (my words), topped by some bits of crispy pieces.  I got it \u00e0 la mode with vanilla ice cream.  The peanut butter is excellent.  Soft, creamy, and very rich!  I'm a fan--big time!\n\nThe restaurant uses the app Wallet so you can pay without pulling out the plastic and they'll email you a receipt if you want.  \n\nThe only drawback for me was the smell of smoke.  The restaurant is open to this small, locals casino and there's a smell of stale smoke as soon as you come in the door from the outside.  This permeates the restaurant and detracts from the overall experience.  I wish they'd put up some doors after scrubbing the place down and trying to get rid of the smoke smell.  But, I will be back.  Even though it's a small menu, there are things to try!"

The location at night time looks a little sketchy, but trust me, well worth it. Delicious little gem in Vegas. The burger is one of the best burgers I have had, and I have had a lot of burgers. Just very flavorful. And the staff is awesome, very accommodating! I remember we tried helping the waitress move the tables to fit out party and she insisted she do it. Unless we wanted to take her job she stated. LoL. Awesome!"

I guess this place started off inside a hair salon but got too busy and started a food truck eventually leading them to open this restaurant. Only con is that its in a small casino that is a little smokey but then again this is Vegas"

I came by for lunch and decided to try their bao and see what the hype was all about.\n\nYou get two bao for one order and lucky for me they were nice enough to let me mix and match the pork and duck baos with one order.\nPeking Duck Bao with cucumber, scallions, and hoisin sauce -- http://bit.ly/Z3btzg\nPork Belly Bao with pickled mustard greens, cilantro, and crushed peanuts --  http://bit.ly/11ds7IZ\nBoth were awesome, but I think I liked the duck the best.  \n\nI also ordered the Sesame Noodles which was very good as well if you're into cold noodles.\nhttp://bit.ly/11drRK0\n\nThe menu is pretty affordable and extensive ranging from burgers and fries to rice bowls and other noodle dishes and there were quite a few other menu items that I wanted to try.  I'm definitely coming back again for the Shrimp Toast and the Fat Choy Burger.  Give Fat Choy a try if you want some awesome Asian comfort food!"

            "review": "There seems to be a trend in Vegas where a slightly unique restaurant opens in town and everyone goes nuts over it for months on end. Case in point: Honey Salt, Eat, Poppy Den, any Gordon Ramsay Restaurant, and pretty much half the places on the Strip. And from my experience so far at some of these places, they're all overrated and honestly nothing out of this world. If you were worried that there weren't any new ones, along comes Fat Choy to kill your worries. On top of their 'famous' bao buns they're now offering a trendy burger to please the masses, so I headed over to see what all the hype was about.\n\nFat Choy is located inside the Eureka Casino, an overly smoky, tiny, awful casino in an older part of town. And when I say smoky, let's be clear, it's completely awful. Upon walking through the doors you get smacked with a wall of cigarette smoke the likes of which I haven't experienced since the last time I went to the Double Down. The building is tiny; the formula of a small space and a group of depressing looking old people smoking endlessly at slot machines makes this for the perfect whirlwind of awful. This smoke doesn't end in the casino, for when you walk into the Fat Choy restaurant space this smell doesn't dissipate. In fact, at one point while I was waiting for my food I marveled at the fact that I couldn't smell any food cooking, just more cigarettes. I didn't spend any more time in the casino itself other than walking through it to get in and out of the restaurant, yet my throat was noticeably sore by the end of my visit.\n\nThe restaurant itself has 5 bar seats, 5 booths and a handful of tables in a generically-decorated typical casino caf\u00e9 style. There were 3 or 4 TV's in the space each with a different show on, and unfortunately the audio that was chosen for us to listen to was an episode of the Kardashians. Major points taken off for that. The menu is extremely simple: almost all Asian-themed items from potstickers, bao, rice & noodles and even the burger. There's also a breakfast menu with about six items on it that are as basic as you can get. We love a great pork belly bao sandwich, so we had to order them before our burgers. It was really good; the pork was extra crispy which I loved, and the peanuts were sparse but added a nice extra crispiness to them. Still, as good as they were I can't say they were worth going out of your way to try with several other bao options in town.\n\nAs for the Fat Choy Burger, it comes with 1/2lb of Angus beef, short rib, bacon, fried egg, cheddar and roasted tomato. Upon first bite you immediately notice how incredibly messy it is, maybe because of the short rib grease. The rib had really great flavor though, as did the super crispy bacon. The patty had good flavor, but seemed to be a bit of the generic pre-made variety. Still it was cooked very close to the medium rare I ordered. The egg was very large and had good flavor, with a bit too much lettuce as usual. I didn't notice anything special about the roasted tomatoes in the burger unfortunately. The bun was a bit thin for all this stuff, but fresh and fit well with everything else. Overall there were really good flavors that differed from bite to bite, but something about it felt like I was in a dive caf\u00e9 in a dive casino, trying to out-do itself and make a tasty cult burger. I was, and for all their noticeable efforts I don't think they quite got there.\n\nThe fries were incredibly undercooked to the point that most were inedible. They were of the frozen generic skinny fry variety but I tend to like those if they're overcooked just right, and not completely raw like these were. In all I don't know if I get all the hype around this place. The bao was good, I'm no pro by any means but I've had better. The burger was certainly good, but nothing that stands out as being worthy to go into this awful smelly building ever again. My meal could have been made better if the fries were decent, but not enough to change my mind too much. So once again I've been able to experience a restaurant that everyone raves about yet I've walked away completely unimpressed and not willing to revisit. Maybe I missed something as everyone seems to think I did with Poppy Den, BurGR, Honey Salt and probably a few others, so venture here at your own risk."

The restaurant is in the strangest, smallest casino, but it adds to the quirkiness. It's actually fun how bright it is compared to the dim casino.\n\nThe server was very kind and we ordered quickly. The soft drinks are HUGE here! We got the bone marrow to start and then I got the Short Rib Grilled Cheese and my bf got the Pork Belly BLT. The marrow was delicious. Not the best I've ever had but very good quality and flavor for the price. The two entrees, very rich. We looked like jerks only being able to eat half of each sandwich, but after the Jan 1 hangover and barely eating, our stomachs could only handle so much. \n\nI enjoyed the grilled cheese, and really loved that it had the dipping sauce. It gave the illusion of tomato soup without having the tomato soup. I also like how they use shoestring fries. I'd definitely like to try this place again, and am super bummed I could only eat half of my sandwich (I craved it during the flight). It's definitely a unique take on food in a different location. Worth the short drive off the strip!"

I had been slacking on trying Fat Choy since its opening, and now literally working next door, I have NO excuses! \nI went solo on my first trip for a lunch break. Wow was it crowded. I sat at the bar, which gave me a peek into the kitchen so I didn't mind. I ordered Gyoza which came with a fresh garlic sauce. Next time I will order them well done the crisp would add what was missing for me. For my entr\u00e9e I ordered Sesame noodles no peanuts. OMG I was in heaven and ate the entire dish!! \nMy second visit my friend and fellow yelper Allison S. joined me for lunch. Between the two of us, our table looked amazing. Even the house salad and dressings were homemade and on point. She had the special, the soft shell crab bao. I had the short rib grilled cheese and the teriyaki chicken rice. The savory taste of the grilled cheese is still lingering in my mouth. Not really but I wish it was!! It melted, I didn't even ask Allison, I simply cut her a piece of my sandwich and said EAT NOW! She agreed it was heaven. I loved the thin cucumber slices in my rice, it went well with the sauce. \nAt the end of the lunch, the coolest thing happen. Chef Sheridan came over to check on us and our food. He totally remembered me from the food truck game. That made my day!! I cant wait to come back and attempt to try something else. It will be hard knowing how yummy that grilled cheese is!"

Now, I consider myself a professional porker from the old school, but in order to be considered a contemporary \"foodie\", one has to venture out into the brave new world of exotica featured on the Food Network, and since \"pork belly\" and \"bacon\" are considered practically synonymous, I was actually anxious to give it a try. I am no longer anxious. It's not that it tastes bad, it's just that it's a little pork with a lot of creepy, greasy, mostly raw fat. How is it that the fat layers on bacon fry up crispy, chewy, and delightful, and this just seems like the stuff that would make you refuse to eat until your mother trimmed it off your meat for you? Yuck. Don't know what the fuss is about, but I'm not blaming it on Fat Choy. I assume this is the way it's supposed to be, and it's just not for me, along with blue-veined cheeses and anything with the word \"tartare\" in the title\n\n. Anyway, what we did have was hot and fresh, and the service was fine- one obviously experienced waitress named Tammi who was working like crazy and appeared to be training a younger one who seemed a little lost. All fine.\n\n However, we returned this week and had brunch. Dropping a star because the hollandaise on the Eggs benedict was salty, runny, and I expect pre-packaged, and the eggs were overdone. The potatoes on, the other hand, were golden, crispy, and delicious. Most everyone else's food was fine, but one poor Sad Sack ordered waffles, and they were so limp and pale you would believe they were cooked by an Englishman. They boil everything! However, it should be noted that the waffles we saw being served a little later to neighboring diners looked brown and toasty. So go ahead and order them, but first ask yourself if you feel lucky today\n\n. Added to this was the fact that they weren't that busy, Tammi was still plugging away, and the no-longer-new girl was still lost. While as a fan of The Walking Dead it was kind of fun watching her wandering around, bumping into walls with a vacant stare and a thin trickle of drool running down her chin, it was pretty much impossible to get a refill from her. Must have been hired for her looks. On the other hand, maybe not."

As with all casino restaurants  there was a faint smell of smoke, but not to bad.  I dont do well with cigarrette smoke vut could tolerate this.  A very nice and friendly waitress.   Maybe seats 20+.  Not many items on the menue but they don't need tham.  I had a special,  a pork belly. BLT on thin sourdough  and it was perfect.   I hate too much bread but this was yummy and grilled.  My lunch partner had a short rib rice bowl that was outstanding.  Tender, not to salty or fat.  Has some salad things on top that we could not exactly identify but yummy and  generous portion to boot. Lunch was served with side of fries or salad for my special.   Found the place on diners and dives.  If you like the whole in the wall no frills different and outstanding Asian American food give this try.  I will be back next time business brings me to the valley.  Annnnd it was inexpensive.  Sorry no pictures of food,  we ate it too fast."

Since it was my birthday, my Dad wanted to take me out to lunch and I knew this would be the spot to take both him and Joel! Boy, I was right! Still totally sticking with my 5 stars. Wish I could give more it was that good. \n\nThis time we split the Duck Bao. The duck was tender and had a little piece of skin! Can you say PERFECT! It's so hard to pick what you want here. Cause I want ALL the things. I went with the special, which was the PBBLT. It was Pork Belly with Bacon, lettuce, tomato and a spicy aioli on Sourdough Bread and a side salad. \nJoel got the Short Rib Grilled Cheese with Fries. He can not stop talking about this sandwich! He said it's not just the best Grilled Cheese he has ever had, but most likely the best sandwich he'll ever have!!!\nMy Dad had the Crispy Duck Leg with Rice. He was so impressed with it all. He cleaned his plate and picked every piece of duck off that leg. \n\nThe Staff is so friendly and very informative of all the dishes! I have to say if it couldn't get any better they have a Coke 100 machine! So I can have ALL the Diet soda flavors!!! Including my current favorite Coke Zero Cherry! \n\nYAY Fat Choy's! I can not wait to be back to eat more of your delicious food!"

I asked for the Shrimp Toast as it sounded fantastic but was warned by the waitress it was really small and that I'd probably want to double up. At the price Fat Choy charges for appetizers I decided against that and ordered the Cheezesteak Sandwhich. I should have just ordered a single Shrimp Toast. The Cheezesteak was not even mediocre. I left more than half on my plate. I didn't even bother to take the rest home.\n\nOn the bright side my Dad did better than me with the Fat Choy Burger. It did look good and he said it was excellent. After I paid I left feeling like I might as well have gambled my money in the Euraka or ate somewhere else. Really disappointing. \n\nThe menu is very hit and miss.

Yes, it is filled with smoke. Yes, the location isn't...ideal. But folks should still check this place out. in spite of the reviews. And yes, in spite of the smoke. \n\nWe only had three items on the menu. We had the short rib grilled cheese, the duck bao, and the pork bao. \n\nThe food was very tasty. The bao was thoughtfully prepared and the meat in each was seasoned well. That crispy skin and moist meat drew me into both bao options. They were solid. The grilled cheese sandwich was gooey and flavorful. And the bread was toasted perfectly and the meat inside was generous and just sweet enough to cut through some of the heaviness of the sandwich. But it was too greasy for me. I was good at the first few bites---I should have stopped there and tried another dish. \n\nHere is the part that you might not understand about this place--there is a heart to the food that cannot be dismissed on the basis of grease, and location, and even smoke. Even without knowing the owner's story (see other reviews) you can taste the thoughtfulness and energy in each bite. These dishes were not thrown together in an attempt to get doors open. They were crafted and tweaked to achieve a specific balance---even the greasy grilled cheese (which was very well flavored, by the way). \n\nI cannot imagine the pressures that a small restaurant has to endure in that kind of setting (small locals casino). I saw people wandering in during a break in their slot play to have a burger followed closely by what looked to be Yelper hipsters looking to try the newest location.  Fat Choy has a diverse audience to consider and I am willing to cut it some slack in its efforts toward making their new location work for their customer base.\n\nI think this business is worth the trip to the Eureka Casino. I think it's worth battling the smoke and stepping over some colorful locals. I admit something about the story does appeal to me. But more than that, the food appeals to me.  I will be back."

Veruka learned her lesson well since we last went out - she decided that, from now on, she's going to order whatever I order. The Tofu and Mushroom Bao was pretty tasty. The kid got the Kalbi Steak and Eggs. The order was pretty large, so he ended up taking home leftovers. Cool, no need to cook tonite! Our waitress, Michelle, was new there. She did a good job of serving us and keeping our drinks full, and also put that 100-flavor soda machine to good use. Her and the other lady that was working behind the counter said that it was the first time they made a real suicide soda. The only drawback to that is that the kid is going to be wired until 3 o'clock in the morning! I forced myself to get dessert, and went for the Red Velvet cake. Sweet dreams!

Ordering\nBetween the 5 of us, we ordered 3 Fat Choy Burgers -  1/2 lb. certified angus beef, shortrib, bacon, fried egg, cheddar, onion jam ($11.99), which includes fries or salad. We ordered ours medium rare; 2 with fries, 1 with a salad.\n\nII. The burgers\nThe burger patties were really big and were cooked perfectly to order. They were very juicy and obviously cooked on a grill (you can taste the char), but could have used more meat flavor. The burger texture was a little monotone; maybe pickles or onions would have helped. The flavor was also a little one dimensional. It needed a sweet or acid note. Trevor mentioned that his burger was inconsistent in flavor from bite to bite. The egg was gorgeously cooked. The bun fell apart a little bit because the burger was so juicy. \n\nIII. The fries\nThe fries were really good! They reminded me of McDonald's fries, which is extremely high praise. Dennis said they were a smidge too salty for his taste. Sumana really enjoyed her salad that was drenched in balsamic (gave her that acid note the rest of us were missing).\n\nIV. Miscellaneous\nFat Choy is located inside the Eureka casino, which is a little bit off the strip. The ventilation in the casino is not very good so the smoke really permeates everywhere, including inside the restaurant. The restaurant itself is really cute and has some fun decoration. It was pretty chill and didn't have a lot of people there (surprising given we went during lunch time on a Saturday). They had good music playing, and our server (Tammi) was really great. Super friendly! This place is pretty easy to get to and has plenty of parking.\n\nV. Value\nAgain, there was some debate regarding the value of this burger. Some of us thought it was a good value considering it comes with a side. Others of us thought it was priced a little high for what it was.\n\nVI. The verdict\nDecent burgers. I'm really curious about their baos, which are their specialties. I'll have to come back for one of those. The ratings: 3.2, 3.3, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1.\n\nNext burger crew meeting: Fuku Burger after we take a burger break at the Mob Museum!"

We again ordered both the Bao and they were pretty good, the potstickers were very greasy and under filled, better to buy the frozen ones from Trader Joe's.\n\nThen the sandwiches:  She ordered the short rib grilled cheese and I the Fat Choy burger with crispy fries. It was not busy but they took forever to arrive. The grilled cheese was dry with very little flavor except for a slightly rancid odor and taste, my burger which was ordered medium rare was also dry and overcooked, the fries were limp and greasy. Every dish was highly oversalted as well.\n\nOur server, I believe her name was Emily, was charming and very efficient but she could not make up for the slowness of the kitchen. I was given a properly cooked burger to go and it was marginally better but there is a limit to what can be done with a cheap ready-made patty.\n\nThere must have been a fair amount of Kool-Aid drunk by many Fat Choy reviewers and it helps no one, not the owner/chef or the potential customers. This place could be fixed, it's a good concept and menu but the execution and cooking are pretty dreadful as are some of the ingredient choices.\n\nAs it stands now, Fat Choy is a 1.5 star experience, sadly it's less than a mile from my house. Bachi Burger is more expensive and over 15 miles from my house, we choose Bachi every time.\n\nCAVEAT COMESTOR!"

If I blind folded you, sat you down at the table, and removed the blindfold, you'd be ready to order an omelet with an extra side of bacon and sausage.  \n\nFat Choy describes itself as Asian-American fare; it has very traditional Asian foods on the menu and then it throws in very traditional American fare such as burgers and chicken wings.  I really don't get this \"synergy\" if any, but whatever, it's not a plus or a minus really.  Maybe you want to get some bao and you can convince your friend to come for the burgers and wings.\n\nWe ordered the pork belly bao, the shortrib rice, chicken teriyaki rice, and 2 orders of Grandma's Potstickers.\n\nPork Belly Bao:\n\nThe wrap itself was good, the flavor of the pork belly was great, but the pork belly was dry as it was a bit overcooked.  Overall it was decent, but not great.\n\nShortrib rice, and chicken teriyaki rice:\n\nI lumped these together because they both had similarities, although the styles are supposed to be totally different.  The similarity here is that they both came with a salad with balsamic vinegar WITHIN the dish.  Wtf, this does NOT go with the flavors of either dish at all, and a salad wasn't mentioned on the menu for either dish.  If I had known it came like that, I would have ask for it on the side.  No veggies were mentioned for the shortrib rice, and market vegetables were mentioned for the chicken teriyaki rice.  The shortrib itself was actually really good, but the rest of the dish was mediocre.\n\nGrandma's Potstickers:\n\nNice pan fried crust.  Definitely a fan of that.  But the filling?  Yo, if my grandma came out with this I'd tell her to get back in the kitchen and work on the damn recipe because yo, where's the flavor?  Kidding, my grandma would slap the dumpling outta my mouth and make me wash the dishes afterwards.  But seriously though, very disappointed in the filling as this dish was hyped up and it was only OKAY.\n\nAll in all, this place gets three stars because the dishes are just okay, and the prices are commensurate with what you get in my opinion.  Would I come back by myself?  Nah.  But if a friend wanted to try it out anyways after I tell them how mediocre it is, meh, sure why not, might as well try out the American side of the menu."

It's a bit out of the way, but well worth the visit.\n\nI've been here a few times and sampled almost everything on the menu. Nothing was disappointing, but the bao really stands out.\n\nIf you come here, you have to order at least one or hopefully all of these dishes:\n\nPork Belly Bao\nRoast Duck Bao\nSoft Shell Crab Bao\n\nThe proteins in all three dishes are cooked to perfection.\n\nThe pork belly is marinated for hours and then slow braised, then finished off on the flat top where it gets caramelized and crispy on the outside. The duck gets similar love and comes out crispy as well.\n\nThe meat is served in perfect little boa pillows with a delicious sauce and some micro greens and/or cucumber.\n\nThe soft shell crab bao is equally good, it's like eating sushi tucked into a cloud of bao goodness.\n\nThe chef(s) here cook with love and put their heart into these dishes. I hope they open another location a bit closer to Summerlin, because I get serious cravings for this stuff.\n\nEasy 5 stars."

The short rib was better in this dish because it had been shredded.  \n\nPoints for service!  Our waitress was great.  But the kitchen incredibly slow.

Comes with fries or salad.  Fries were just meh.  Salads would've been a fresh spring mix.  About the reviewers who complained about the grease factor here:  I didn't think that even a plain grilled cheese could be termed \"health food.\"  Throw in some short rib and...well, what did you think you were ordering?!\n\nroasted duck bao:  Bao part was perfectly moist and textured.  Duck was good, too.  I would have preferred more fillings though.  I know it normally comes with the duck sauce and green onions, but I expected a little more creativity for the cost.  You only get two.\n\nshrimp toast:  Good.  Even better with the runny egg yolk.  Def a must order.\n\nFat Choy Burger:  Reasonable price for a burger on the strip.  Still just a burger with short rib.  \n \nPBBLT:  BLT with rib that tasted like a simple BLT.\n\nDuck Rice:  I thought this was good and a must order.  My husband was not as impressed.\n\nFried Pork Sauce Noodles:  My least favorite.  Sauce was too thick on the rice noodles (?).  Would not order again.  \n\nService was likely the best part of the meal.  Jenny, our server, was the only one working and she made sure everything ran smoothly.  I saw mostly locals there, and even a table that probably only came to Eureka Casino for Fat Choy, like us.\n\nI had high hopes as this appeared to be a foodie haven from reading yelp reviews, but only found a solid restaurant selling good but unmemorable food."

Don't let the neighborhood or the exterior spook you. Located inside the Eureka casino, Fat Choy was much smaller than I expected. But we were seated right away in a booth in the corner.\n\nThere were so many items on the menu we wanted to try ... so we did! We ordered the potstickers, wonton soup, and order of pork belly bao, and an order of softshell crab bao. The potstickers came out first and had a wonderful dipping sauce to accompany them. The wonton soup came out next and had great flavor. We added a side of noodles to our soup for extra \"filling.\" The broth of the soup was tasty and brought the whole thing together. The pork belly bao were everything I hoped they would be. \n\nBut then things went a little south from there. We placed our order for the softshell crab bao after we placed our order for all the other food and it took almost half an hour to get our softshell crab. \n\nThe waitresses kept apologizing and saying that there was a new cook in the kitchen and that is why service was so slow. Because the food was so good and we weren't in a rush, I'm willing to forgive the slow service. And the next time I'm in Vegas, if I'm craving bao or some tasty wonton soup, Fat Choy is where I will go. (And the prices can't be beat!)"

I found this place on yelp which looked promising.\n\nAfter some convincing, I got my husband to come with me. Eurika casino is located off the strip and the area does not look very appealing. The parking lot to the casino was decent sized for its establishment. \n\nThe casino itself smelled so heavily cigarette stained but I raced with all my might to the restaurant. (Thanks to whoever posted the front entrance of the restaurant). \n\nI walked in and was immediately greeted by a kind lady. I approached the counter and looked at the menu (not sure why since I was only there for the duck bao). The same kind lady informed me there was a $1 charge for to go option but the wait would still be around 30mins (at least). I said no problem and ordered two orders of duck bao. When I have her my card to swipe, she said she would wave the dollar charge since the wait will be a while (so nice of her). The iPhone transaction thing auto texts you the receipt post payment (cool!)\n\nWe waited on the side benches and saw a signed cutting board by \"Guy\" from the food network  show. The nice lady who helped us was also in the photo with him and the owner (who the little mascot is based on I assume). \n\nTwenty minutes later, I received my to go box and was instructed to quickly consume contents to ensure freshness. The nice lady kept on apologizing about the wait which was not a big deal but dang, service sure is great. \n\nMy husband and I steadfastly went to the car and opened the magic lunch box. OMG omg... They looked amazing and smelled delicious. \n\nI took some pictures and then in my mouth it went. Oh M g mouthgasm. The crunch of the duck skin. Tender meat. Delicious sauce and nice added cucumber crunch was simply amazing. My husband is the most picky Asian food eager and even he was like oh my god this is good. Needless to say we scarfed them down in less than 6 minutes. \n\nIf you're looking for a duck bao fix. LOOK NO FURTHER! Thank you for the delicious bun :)"

We were very patient, but an apology for the lateness would have been nice.\n\nWhen we arrived, the place was about 1/2 full. Cute little diner inside an old casino (Eureka Casino)... As you walk into the casino to get to the diner, there's like a wall of cigarette smoke that hits you... Not like the newer casino/hotels, but fortunately the diner wasn't so bad. It's pretty clean, cute decor with a few booths, few tables and some bar seats.\n\nThe menu is a mix of American diner foods and Chinese  foods. I heard about this place from my brother so wanted to check it out. We ordered coffee (which was really good), duck bao, fried duck rice and sesame noodles. The sesame noodles came out first. It's a vegetarian dish but you can add meat if you like. We had it veggie style. It's peanuty and has a good amount of veggies in it. However I did think the noodles were a bit over cooked. Still good though, but not spectacular.\n\nThe duck bao came out next. They tasted a lot better than they looked. The fried duck rice came out last. We both stared at the dish in confusion. We thought it was a fried rice dish but was a duck and rice place with a side salad. We got a fried egg with the plate, which was a bit over cooked. This dish was just ok. The bao was definitely the best out of all the things we ordered.\n\nOverall food was ok, nothing spectacular and just took waaaaaaay too long to get to our table. If they continue this way, might be hard to survive. Seemed like there were issues in the kitchen. Like I said servers were super nice but no apology for lateness.

You have a counter, tables and booths. Big screens with sports and the Food Network. Staff are fast,friendly and love to describe the dishes and the quality they put into them.\n\nFor what you see being served, you pay half of what you would find in fancier spots on the strip but get ALL the taste and portions. Expect to spend from $7 - $14 depending on appetite; My bill with tea was $12. \nThey even have one of those 100+ Coke mix machines! I ordered the Fat Choy burger with fries: 1/2 lb burger made with (over night marinated) short ribs, bacon and a perfect sunny side up egg.\n\nThe Chef Sheridan Su is a perfectionist; even the fries were perfectly crisp and light. See, a cook moves out food; a Chef will not put anything out UNLESS it is something THEY would eat. They stay in control of the prep, purchasing  and delivering the finished product. He put in time at some of the best places on the strip and has struck out on his own with this; you should take advantage of it and avoid fighting the strip to \"eat gourmet at a Denny's price\". If there was one thing I could ask for it would be for Chef Su to teach a class for other restaurant cooks on how to correctly make bacon.\n \nAnytime day or night, this is a place to hide from high prices and so-so food.

Monday nite May 13 \n\n-  We waited ~40-45 minutes and did not get our Fat Choy Burgers.\n-  There were 5 tables in the whole place that had seated customers not exactly a sellout.\n-  Wait staff was 2 young girls who tried their best but the food was not coming out\n-  We noticed a plate being returned to the kitchen as being cold from one of the 5 tables that had gotten served\n-  We were told the kitchen was a bit backed up about 20 minutes after being seated\n-  Finally, after seeing the returned dish and what appeared to be lack of production and expertise in the kitchen, I went left my seat and confronted the wait staff and found out:\n   1.  the plate was indeed returned for being cold\n   2.  the chef on duty was \"new\" (first timer) as the regular chef was not in the kitchen that night.\n\nThat was enough information to pack up and get out before we were given a version of the 10 Best Burgers made by a \"new\" chef.\n\nTo use a baseball analogy, you will not win the World Series if you only have a good starting pitcher (i.e. the regular chef) without having a competent bullpen of backups to finish the job.  Especially after getting such a review in the local paper that would expect to draw in new customers.  \n\nSad amateurish performance.  We were so hoping this would be a great place to return to as we love the bartender and the casino."

The duck and pork belly bao are always a hit, but there are other items just as worthy of being ordered. The short rib rice dish is comprised of two large chunks of boneless beef sitting atop the fluffiest rice imaginable. No knives are needed. The beef easily falls apart with the slightest poke. If you need a little grease, the short rib grilled cheese is the way to go. Plenty of beef fill this sandwich along with an onion jam and provolone and cheddar cheese. The acidity of the tomato dip puts this dish over the top. For more subtle, but equally excellent flavors, \"Grandma's potstickers\" delivers. The crispy seared bottom to the dumplings serve as a sign of quality before cutting into the pork and green onion mixture within. The location (inside the Eureka casino) may not be the best, but the food is well worth the visit through the smokey environment.\n\n4.5 Stars"

            "review": "Fat Choy is a hidden gem of a restaurant located inside the Eureka Casino on Sahara. We have been here a total of three times now, twice dining in and once for a takeout order. The first time I ate here with my husband and friend (she had no idea what to expect but she trust my judgment). You seat yourself I try to get the back booth because the smoke is pretty heavy in the casino, but I've never smelled the smoke in the restaurant itself.\n\nWe started off by asking the waitress about the soda machine. She pretty much told us that you could get any soda flavor combination you can imagine except for cream soda. Our soda's came out in HUGE 32oz glass beer mugs with free refills. We ordered two servings of \"Grandma's Potstickers\" My husband and friend ordered the Fat Choy Burger, and I ordered the Sesame Noodles, and Short Rib Grilled Cheese.\n\nIt takes a while for the potstickers to cook, so be patient. Our waitress served our potstickers and said, i quote \"I'm so excited for you to try these!!\" They come five to an order, with a side of ponzu sauce with garlic, green onion, and a hint of balsamic vinegar. The first bite just blew my mind. The outside was perfectly pan seared in sesame oil, and great pork filling. By far the best I've ever had!\n\nNext the entrees came out shortly after. My husband's and friends Fat Choy burger came out. It comes on a soft bun with perfectly cooked medium rare sirloin beef  (if requested), short rib, bacon, cheddar, roasted tomato, and a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg, which my friend commented \"It looks like an eye staring at me!\". LOL!! It was huge, juicy, and sloppy. One of my husband's favorite burgers.\n\nWe shared the Sesame Noodles, which came with roasted wild mushrooms, cucumbers, carrots, peanuts, and sesame vinaigrette which had a bite to it with Sriracha. One of my favorite dishes. Very addicting. My friend was saying she didn't like noodles too much but she was sure stuffing them down like nobody's business. LOL!!\n\nThe Short Rib Grilled Cheese with Onion Jam, Provolone, and Cheddar cheese was good but not my favorite dish on the menu. I will say the Onion Jam was interesting, never had it before. My third time here I tried the PBBLT, with pork belly, bacon, tomato, lettuce, sriracha mayo. Huge portion of pork belly!! Can't wait for my  Father-in -law to try this!!\n\nMy husband and I keep craving this place. We came here the next day for takeout (I would recommend eating it fresh however) The food is top notch \nfor a small establishment. The waitstaff is friendly, the prices are very reasonable for the large portions you get. Till next time Fat Choy!!!"

            "review": "I have been meaning to eat at Fat Choy ever since I moved back to Vegas almost 4 years ago. I  have only heard and read wonderful things about it, so I was very surprised to walk in at noon today to a completely empty restaurant. I actually walked out just to double check I was in the actual Fat Choy restaurant. \n\nThe restaurant is small, very small, with a 50's diner fill. Two tv's on the wall and a mix of hip hop and 90's surfer/skater punk rock. The menu is small but it seems as though you can order off the menu. They offered two different specials today but I went with an off the menu Pork Belly BLT. A mix of Bacon, Pork Belly, Tomato, Iceberg Lettuce on top of two slices of sour dough bread. It was creamy, and delicious. The pork was fatty but super tender. This sandwich is super rich, I would rather share it than eat the entire thing myself.\n\nI also enjoyed the pan fried potstickers which were awesome. I was told these were the Chef's mothers recipe and were a perfect way to start. They were crispy fried on one side adding great texture and soft on the back. This gave the potsticker a really nice chew, one of my favorite potstickers to date.\n\nI'm excited to try some of the other options on the menu in the future. This food is not for the health conscious, and I think it's intentional. It's about packing Big Flavors inside a little restaurant, inside of a little casino just off the strip. And the emptiness of the restaurant when I arrived soon began to fill up, maybe people were just waiting for me to order."

            "review": "I'm a bao that life.\n\nIn a city that loves a good bao. The Pork Belly Bao ($7 for 2) is a solid option - It has pickled mustard greens, cilantro, crushed peanuts, and hoisen sauce. The only gripe I had, was that some parts of the pork belly was too tough and dry to get my teeth into. Other than that, it was a tasty bao and the best thing I ate here. Flavor rating: 4/5\n\nWe also tried the duck rice - It comes with a crispy duck leg (not so crispy), cucumber salad (basic spring mix with a light soy sauce dressing?), fried shallot, and ginger scallion sauce (the best part!) for $12, we also added a sunny fried egg (their egg needed work - it was too slimy) for an extra $2. The duck rice wasn't too shabby, but I think it was missing something; It tasted rather dull. Then it dawned on us, you need to eat it with the ginger scallion sauce it comes with (by the tablespoons), in order to wake the dish up and give it some character. The overall dish reminded me of Hainan chicken and rice, but with duck. Awesome concept, but it didn't blow me or my tastebuds away. Flavor rating: 3/5\n\nThe sesame noodles ($8) were a big fat NO. The entire dish was terribly bland and tasted like it came straight from the market's prepackaged and refrigerated isle. The menu advertised roasted wild mushrooms, yet we see saut\u00e9ed cremini and canned straw mushrooms (from biglots?) Don't get me wrong, I love canned straw mushrooms (I'm asian, I know all about it and use it in my cooking.) But the ones used in this dish, were like a weird-tasteless-knockoff brand. To top it off, I didn't taste \"roasted,\" let alone any of the \"wild mushroom\" earthiness or nuttiness in the dish - this was the reason I ordered this dish and it was all a major lie. Also, the peanut sesame vinaigrette needs work, lots of it; It was not flavorful or exotic, it was uninteresting and weak. I was extremely turned off by this lackluster dish and after the second bite, I refused to eat any more. Flavor rating: 1/5\n\nWould I come back? There's a 50% chance. There are many restaurants in Vegas offering a good ol' bao nowadays (BURGR, Bachi Burger, Jinya Ramen Bar) and there is nothing that makes the bao here stand above the rest. Although, I might return to give their burgers a shot."

The food was good, but the service was just terrible.  We sat down at a booth where there were four other tables and a 6 top taken.  For this place with one cook in the back, it must have been very overwhelming, because our food took 42 minutes to get to us.  That being said, our table remained piled with dishes, drinks were never refilled, and after a TWO HOUR DINNER at Fat Choy, most of that time in waiting, I waived the white flag and approached the counter to pay for my bill while we waited for our last order of bao to come out.\n\nThe bao this evening was slightly different, heavier on the pickled greens, folded in cold bao instead of steamed bun, fingerprints of sauce on the buns from the cook, and it lacked the crushed peanuts on top.  Our potstickers were more greasy than our first two times at Fat Choy, and those took an additional 30 minutes because the server failed to write our order down properly the first time.  \n\nWith that being said, we will seek out another bao place in town.  Service is everything to me, and after last night, this place is not worth returning to if the service and quality of food can be that inconsistent."

We came here especially for their duck bao and pork belly bao but they were all out of the pork belly so we settled on two orders of the duck bao and an order of the short rib grilled cheese. The waitress was very nice but she must have misunderstood us and only gave us one order of the duck bao instead of two orders. It was near closing time so we didn't want to say anything. \n\nThe duck bao is definitely something I would get again on my next visit. It was very tasty but small, I guess that's why it's listed under snacks on the menu. Two pieces of bao come in one order so the boyfriend and I shared. We also shared the short rib grilled cheese, and OMG, I want all my grilled cheese sandwiches from now on to taste like the grilled cheese sandwich I had from here. The meat was so tender and tasty.\n\nThe restaurant is small and very casual, and is located inside the Eureka Casino which is a small, smoked-filled casino on East Sahara. I don't usually come to this part of town so I had never even heard of the casino until I read about Fat Choy. The cigarette smell/smoke is horrible inside the casino but once you're in the restaurant, it's not too bad. \n\nThere were many other things on the menu that looked really good so I will definitely be returning and hopefully they won't be all out of the pork belly bao."

Both the duck and pork bao were delicious.  All the ingredients were super fresh and you could tell there was a lot of love putting them together.  The meats were juicy and perfectly cooked.  There was delicious duck fat dribbling down my arm when I took the first bite.  YUM!  The pork fat was melt in your mouth good.  \nThe short rib grilled cheese on the other hand, was disappointing.  The menu said cheddar cheese but to us, it really tasted like Kraft American slices.  I'm pretty sure I can distinguish the difference between cheddar and American.  Onion jam you say?  What onion jam?  Couldn't taste it.  The tomato dip on the side should be renamed \"warm jarred marinara\" as that's exactly what it tasted like.  I thought since there was so much TLC poured into the baos that maybe the owners would have done something unique for their fries.  But nope, they're just mass produced, store bought, frozen. \n\nService was fine, I was expecting to have to wait for a long time after reading others' reviews, but maybe it was because there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant when we were there. \n\nThe ambiance and location SUCKED!!  The restaurant is located in the Eureka Casino and it's an open door leading into the restaurant - It was seriously like sitting in an ashtray while trying to eat.  The smoke was overwhelming and it was hard to enjoy our meal. \n\nI'm not sure if I will be back - don't get me wrong..  the bao were sooo good!  But being a non-smoker, I'm not sure I can handle sitting in a gross old building with second hand smoke as my complimentary side."

The burger is 1/2 pound of  Angus beef and consisted of the following toppings of boneless short ribs, bacon, cheddar cheese, roasted tomato and , a fried egg on a fresh bun. \n\nAll I  have to say the burger didn't last very long on my plate it was Deeeeelicious!! After devouring my burger treat I also noticed on their menu they had pork belly which I  haven't tried before so, I ordered a small portion of  pork belly slices which shortly arrived and  it had a fatty kind of bland flavor but, with a little tobasco on it I woke up the flava.\n\nAnyway to sum it up the food was great the server was friendly and the place was clean.

You step into the Eureka Casino and all you smell is cigarette smoke.  But then you walk into Fat Choy and find a cute diner with diner servers.  \n\nOur server was incredibly friendly and nice.  I was initially concerned that both servers were older American ladies who didn't look like they really understood Chinese food, but they certainly made up for it with their friendly service.  \n\nInterestingly the owner was walking in and out of the restaurant but she completely lacked any personality.  We were sitting between two tables who were trying to compliment her on the restaurant and some chef award that he husband won.  It was shocking to see how disengaged she was with these fans.\n\nFortunately the food was tasty.  We had several orders of the duck bun and an unbelievable pork bun.

I first started to look for the Shrimp Toast I had heard so much about and well...come to find out it is a special and not on the menu all the time...DAMMIT!!  I moved on to the Crispy Garlic Chicken wings...BAM foiled again, also not on the menu!  So I continued to work the placard menu in hand and try not to be disappointed while the monitor above my head teased of dishes that were, you guessed it, not on the menu.  I was crying by this point into my Stella and the server came with a tissue and said buck up little butter cup you will not be disappointed by the bao.\n\nWhoa daddy.  I had the pork belly bao and the crispy duck bao, (two per order), and I pretty much drooled all over myself just trying to get it all down as fast as I could.  Pretty bomb, folks, with a perfect not spongey bun, the belly was the perfect fat to meat consistency, the crispy duck was a bit stingy (or im just gluttonous), and i rounded it all out with gyoza that was \"asi asi\" nothing special but had good flavor and was prepared correctly.  I neglected the rest of the menu already deciding that I would come back because I had to order another round of Pork Belly Bao.  What? Don't judge me!\n\nIf it wasn't for the guy who just lost $6,000 samolies but still had time to yell into his \"brand new\" apple watch and listen to Iggy Azalea at full tilt, I-G-G-Y, I-G-G-Y, while carrying on an absent conversation with me throught six teeth, that couldn't quite handle the wedge salad with a caraf of blue cheese he ordered on the side, it would have been a perfect little lunch adventure.  Thanks Fat Choy, Ill be back!! Eat on Amurica!!"

I arrived and was told that they are closed because of a private party for Chinese New Year. I'm glad that you thought it was a great idea to turn away two locals that might return again and again to accomodate a table of ten. Based on the prices the table is going to garnish the max of $300, but are losing potentially $ 1000's on locals. I probably will never return, considering the mind boggling selection of Asian fusion restaurants I have to choose from. Sorry fat Choy your loss!"

My companion was so hungry, he ate part of mine while waiting for his, which didn't come out for another 10 minutes. I ordered pork belly bao and Peking duck bao. Pork beat duck. The rolls were cold, although the meat was warm. The pot stickers came out greasy; had been cooked at too low a temperature. My companion's reuben had thick, salty corned beef, although it was grilled, a plus. Chef Sheridan was not on duty today. Check before ordering. Not worth braving the second hand smoke unless you're going to be rewarded with good food."

Tucked in a Reno-like casino a little off the strip in the back is Fat Choy's.  Definitely looks a lot livelier in the restaurant.\n\nOur friendly waitress told us that they have the Freestyle machine (the Coke machine where you can combine flavors to make like a 100+ different drinks), so I opted for a raspberry coke even though I rarely ever drink soda.  Our sodas were served in huge mugs and the raspberry coke was so good.  \n\nWe ordered the Shrimp Toast ($8) & Peking Duck Baos ($7) to share.  She ordered the PBBLT ($9) & I ordered the Fried Pork Sauce Noodles ($9).  The Shrimp Toast was a piece of toast topped with Chinese sausage, herbs, Sriracha mayo and a beautiful over easy egg.  This was delish!  I love Chinese sausage, Sriracha and an over easy egg done right...so how could I not like this dish?  Just wish there was more!  ;-)  The Peking Duck Baos were made well, a big enough piece of delicious duck (not too fatty) and the hoisin sauce in between the pillowy soft buns.  I think these were better than Chairman Bao's.  I ordered the Fried Pork Noodle because I looked at the Yelp pics and one of them showed it with what looked to be slices of fried pork; however when I got the dish in front of me it was ground pork.  It was like the minced pork and cucumber noodle dish you see at Shanghai restaurants, but the sauce is lighter here.  I still enjoyed it and it was a nice alternative to all the breads we've had in the meal.  Her PBBLT was good too, the belly was cooked a little more though and the mixed greens salad served alongside was pretty darn good for a plain salad I must say.\n\nYou must try Fat Choy if you have a car when in Vegas.  It's a great Chinese fusion restaurant that's super affordable and different from what you'd find on the strip."

The wall near the entrance has a brief artsy history in regards to Fat Choy. It turns out, the owner(s) are from the SGV (626) which is essentially where I grew up.. so naturally I was immediately intrigued.\n\nAttention: Bao is my new favorite treat, I'm convinced. I could easily eat 3 orders of the Peking Duck Bao without question. I pretend I'm full around other people, but the fat boy inside me yearns to continuously eat and eat. *Wrapped within a fluffy n' soft sweet bao bun, covered in a thick hoisin sauce, cucumbers and scallion; the duck is layered and cooked to a crisp with a succulent inside. Every bite was thoroughly relished. Equally impressive is the Pork Belly Bao, which is covered w/ chopped peanuts, cilantro & pickled mustard greens. The pork is a little fatty, to my liking, and too has a juicy inside that leaves your mouth watery and wanting more.\n\nShort rib rice bowl is a must - the dish can easily serve 2; them short ribs are braised with a tender bite. A knife is not needed, as the meat cuts smooth like butter. Mix that with some white rice and a fried egg, pop open that yolk and let it run! The greens in the bowl don't mix too well with the heavy BBQ section, so you can just shove 'em to the side if you're like me. Aside from that, the meat-y yolkish part was tremendous.\n\nI've found Fat Choy an ideal place to share a few small yet fulfilling dishes with friends just a little off the Vegas strip. We were able to try most of the menu upon my last two visits; both times the service was great, the food had my taste buds tinglin' and I left with a satisfied stomach."

Located in the corner of a space best defined as 'questionable' and more appropriately 'seedy' I was admittedly impressed at how separated Fat Choy seemed from the casino and how well the smoke from the slots was excluded from the dining experience and after getting past these issues I was even happier to find the service aspects of the restaurant far better than the typical \"Chinese restaurant\" and actually on par with many high end places on the strip.  With a small crowd of varying ages and ethnicities I made a simple inquiry about the shrimp toast (not typically on the brunch menu) and was assured the chef would be happy to prepare it and although each dish I ordered was good the funky sausage juxtaposing shrimp and tinged with spicy mayo all melded together with a fried egg was undoubtedly the 'must try' dish of the meal.  Opting next for a crunchy waffle topped with somewhat mundane chicken and a bit of Sriracha spiked syrup alongside the signature Duck Bao - a great rendition with pillowy bread, crisp skin, and snappy pickles all playing for center stage - I think it is safe to say that sticking with less \"American\" food is in one's best interest, though the fusion focused crisp roti topped nutella, rich mascarpone, smoky walnuts, and ample honey makes me think that perhaps something like a Korean style chicken and waffles could be just the right thing to add to the menu."

I've been living in Las Vegas for most of my life, and have never even heard of Eureka casino. I've driven past it quite a few times, and yet never noticed it. \n\nTo say the least, i was pretty disappointed in the service that I received. The waitress had come to our table, asked for drink our drink orders. My friend and I both ordered a coke. Five minutes later, she brought 1 drink out. What?! She set it down without acknowledging us and walked away immediately. Why she thought that only one of us wanted a drink, I'll never know. It's not like we had waters on our tables or any other drinks with us. She finally came back about 7 - 8 minutes later to take our food order. I ordered the Pork belly BLT as well as ordered the shrimp toast as an appetizer. The waitress came back probably another 10-15 minutes later, and informed me that they can't make shrimp toast anymore. Why it took that long to inform me, I'm not quite sure. There were only two other diners in the restaurant, so the kitchen couldn't have been that busy. It shouldn't have taken them 10 minutes to realize that they couldn't make an appetizer. \n\nFood was decent. The pork belly on the sandwich was amazing. The only downfall to the sandwich was that my bread was rock hard, leading me to believe it had been sitting in the pass for quite some time. Disappointing to say the least. \n\nThree stars for the food, and the food alone. Wish i could give it more, but rock hard bread? No thanks. Bad service. Bad experience. Would have wanted to go back to try more of the menu, but the service was just so distasteful, I'm not sure if I will."

Don't get me wrong - the restaurant is clean and the seating is comfortable and casual.  I'm afraid people could be somewhat turned off by the location, but if you want delicious Asian/American comfort fusion head over ASAP.\n\nMy husband and I first visited about a year ago.  We always get the pork belly bao ($7), a menu must have.  Thick pan-seared pork belly on soft bao with peanut sauce and pickled greens.  The pork belly is a melt-in-your-mouth crispy delight and the bao are the freshest  I've had. Short rib grilled cheese ($10) is another must have for my hubby.  Generous amounts of tender meat, cheddar cheese and more delicious BREAD.\n\nThe other item I was delighted with was the shrimp toast.  A generous portion of shrimp atop a delicate toasty slice of French-ish bread, a tiny fried egg, Chinese sausage, drizzled with aioli.  Much, much different than your Chinese restaurant variety.  Alas, the server told me it wasn't very popular and it is only served as a special now. :(  Same with the bone marrow, not enough orders to keep it around.\n\nConsistently good, fresh, well-cooked food and the friendly and knowledgeable servers keep us coming back.  Recommend for a casual night out with friends, date night and don't forget Sunday brunch. :) Ice cold cheap draft beers (Abita Turbo Dog, Widmer) at the bar! ($2.75)"

The servings are slider size so it's either meant for sharing or buy 2 for a light meal. The pork bao are probably the best I've had and the same goes for the duck which is easily on par with most joints in the LA Valley area. \n\nThe slow cooked short ribs were super tender and the pickled garnish was a nice touch. Add bacon and eggs to help with the flavor. \n\nThe pot stickers are fresh tasting and home made. The wonton soup was very deerrricious as well. \n\nThe daily special was a pork belly BLT which was pretty amazing as well. Didn't have a bad dish at all. \n\nLove the FAT CHOY logo, it's comical.

We also tried the medium hot chicken wings, wonton soup, and the shortrib grilled cheese sandwich.  The restaurant itself is attractive, we were seated immediately and I had already perused the menu online so had a good idea of what I wanted to try.  The BF tried the wonton soup, came with crispies and he said it was very good.  I tasted the broth and thought it very tasty.  We both enjoyed the chicken wings, ordered crispy.  They came cooked just right and they were not greasy,  but were not reallly spicy at all to my taste.  They were still very tasty, I just expected morebite I guess. Next time I will try the HOT ones.  BF wished they had had the hot mustard that some chinese places have but they did not have it here, onlly the srihacha hot sauce.  The potstickers were divine.  I loved the sauce they came with and devoured all of them.  The sandwich was good, but needed more salt.  All in all we left stuffed, happy and wanting to come back.  I want to try more items here, the angus burger and the duck rice.  We felt the meal was tasty and satisfactory.  We will be back!!  The only drawback today was that the service was a bit slow, there was only one waitress and the restaurant was not  very busy.  She was very pleasant but we had to wait for our dishes and the check."

I actually didn't mind that the restuarant is located in the Eureka Casino, it makes these local restaurants even more interesting and keeps snobs away.\n\nWe chose different items from their snacks section of the menu. We chose the potstickers, chicken wings, shrimp toast and the duck and pork belly bao. The potstickers were really good, so were the wings, although they are like wings you can get anywhere else. Maybe a ranch/sriracha sauce to accompany them would be nice. The meat on both baos was good, but we thought they could've used something moist in them. Neither my husband or I are experts on baos, we've only tried the twice, so it could be that we aren't used to them. The shrimp toast I did not understand, maybe if I would've eaten it as soon as we recived it, but by the time I tried it the egg was kind of cold. My husband really enjoyed it though, and he is picky when it comes to runny eggs. The service is very attentive and friendly, so that's a big plus. \n\nAll in all it was a decent meal; I thought the prices were a tad bit high considering the location."

            "review": "One of the hottest restaurants around is located within Eureka Casino on East Sahara. Before Fat Choy, Chef Sheridan Su (former executive chef at Comme Ca) was serving Great Bao in the most unlikely place; a nail salon. I never tried it back then because I have an aversion to the smell. Dining with salon fumes never seemed appetizing in the least bit. I never tracked down the food truck, and it's taken me sometime to travel to the eastside, but I've finally done it. The Eureka Casino was nicer than I expected and I had heard interesting characters patronize the casino. However, on Sunday afternoon it was clean, quiet and no characters in sight. Not sure what it says about me, but I felt right at home. We strolled back to Fat Choy and took a seat. \n\nThe waitress brought over menus; they had a limited selection and no rice or noodle dishes. We selected the duck bao ($7), and the tofu mushroom bao ($6) after she suggested it over the pork belly ($7). We also ordered the short rib grilled cheese ($10) and the nutella roti ($6) for dessert. We chose a plain old diet coke and diet dr. pepper from their new soda machine with dozens of flavors. Our bao came out first. Duck and pork belly were brought out. The order was wrong, but we stuck with it. The buns are steamed to perfection. The pork belly was fantastic, the fat rendered perfectly so it was rich, tender and filled with that wonderful pork flavor. I loved the freshness from the cilantro and greens, and the texture of the crushed peanuts. This was indeed great bao. The duck was delicious too. The hoisin sauce was light and didn't overwhelm the duck at all. Now, I'm curious how the mushroom and tofu bao would be. Tasty, I'm sure. \n\nThe short rib grilled cheese comes with provolone and cheddar, onion jam and a side of marinara sauce. I'm a purist when it comes to grilled cheese; I'd prefer it with only one type of cheese. I thought the two cheeses made it a bit greasy, the sourdough bread grilled beautifully and the short rib was tender and flavorful with the onion jam. The marinara was thick from the tomato paste. Again, not my preference, but still all the components make and enjoyable sandwich. My husband liked it just fine. My tastebuds just didn't concur. There was nothing notable about the fries. \n\nThe Nutella Roti had me intrigued, nutella, mascarpone, honey and walnuts on roti... what's not to love? The wait, as it turns out. We waited and waited and waited. We would've cancelled had our waitress been around. She conveniently disappeared. We waited and waited some more. It was ridiculous. We asked the other waitress and she said it would be right up. We waited and waited. Finally, the pancake topped with goo was brought to the table. The pancake was incredibly greasy, aside from that the flavors were pretty good, but definitely not worth the wait. I could be more forgiving if it were busy, but we were one of three tables. I'd hope they weren't that far in the weeds with seven diners.\n\nOur patience wore thin; we refused to be held hostage for our bill so my husband went to the counter to take care of it. The eats are pretty darn tasty. I'd return for more bao and I'd love to try the duck rice and potstickers. I certainly hope service will be improved."

I was super bummed as I had been craving bao buns the entire day!  Opportunity presented itself again.  Looking back I can't help but feel that the cosmos was trying to intervene and keep us out if this place.  I have to agree with the reviewer who described the smoke gauntlet you had to pass through at the Eureka to get to Fat Choy.  Upon entering we saw an Asian man in a chef coat leaving.  We guessed that was Chef Sheridan.  Uh oh...\n\nOur server was friendly was patient as we tried to figure out how many of each thing we needed to satisfy our ravenous bao cravings.  We settled on two of each duck bao, pork bao, bone marrow and short rib rice.  We also ordered the potstickers and the sesame noodles.  The good: the potstickers and the pork bao, although according to the video of menu items showing, we were missing some key garnishes.  The bad: The bone marrow was not bad itself, but the floppy sourdough (why sourdough?) that came with it was a huge miss.  I've had the bone marrow at Comme Ca where Chef Sheridan came from and this one pales in comparison.  It was like the Walmart version.  The duck bao was not only missing all the garnishes, they seemed to be missing the duck.  It was a hoisin-like sauce and crispy skin.  That's it.  Not even enough skin to make it worthwhile.  Next up the short rib rice.  It came out cold.  Also it was missing the pickled mustard greens, which were substituted terribly with mixed salad greens and I'm pretty sure, straight up balsamic vinegar.  According to some of the other reviewers pics, we were missing some other garnishes too.  I was so jealous when I looked at those pics because that is not the food we got.  I wish the server had told us ahead of time that they were out of these items.  It's not like they were busy.  It was a Wednesday evening and two or three other parties were there.\n\nNot sure I'd give this place another chance.  Chef Sheridan, you need to let the bottle blond with the neck tatoos go, 'cause she is not doing your food justice!"

This place cares about their clients and the food they make one order at a time. For a local this is a must for those who are on vacation and tired of eating at the same overpriced cookie cutter places on the strip take a cab here for a casual dinner. I went with the duck Bao, short rib grilled cheese and a wonton soup. This place could be in the Wynn tomorrow if they wanted to sell out. Trust me eat here."

            "review": "I have no idea what happened between March 2013, when Niyen wrote his review raving about the Fat Choy burger, and now, but the burger is completely lackluster and worthy of absolutely zero accolades.  \n\nThe patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and there was an egg on it, but that's about all I can say- visually, yes, there was short rib, but it didn't have any flavor. The other ingredients mentioned on the menu, bacon and roasted tomato? So sparingly applied that I didn't even detect them. Niyen's original description includes onion jam, and that is now missing from the menu altogether, but that bright bit of acidity would have cut through the fat and added a pop of flavor. As I ate this burger, I was asking myself why I was continuing to eat it. That's how underwhelming it was.\n\nThe bao aren't noteworthy either, though. Everyone does a pork bao so I opted for the peking duck and the tofu-mushroom versions here. Visually, the tofu-mushroom is already unappealing, with a square sheet of tofu falling out of the bao and minimal stringy mushrooms. Taste wasn't bad, but I wouldn't rave about this to any of my vegetarian friends. And the duck meat on the other bao was dry, accompanying sauce was unremarkable. Everything was very one-note.\n\nService was polite. I'll add that if you sub a salad for your side of fries (with the burger), it's literally a handful of spring mix salad blend: no tomato, no cucumber, nothing else at all added. \n\nIf using a card, payment is processed through Square (or a similar product/service), and you are presented with a tip percentage page- I'm kicking myself for selecting a $3 tip for absolutely zero service and mediocre food to boot. Never again."

Prior to Fat Choy, located in a less-than-impressive Vegas casinos, Sui was cooking up buns in a nail salon. And people lined up out the door to taste. It's gotta be good, right? \n\nDon't let the smoky, seedy Eureka Casino fool you... this is gourmet Asian fusion. With a few American staples still on the menu from the coffee shop who used to inhabit the space. It's very odd to see old, trucker-looking dudes hanging out here. But it's a dichotomy that I'm willing to wrestle in exchange for a gourmet bowl of sesame noodles, plate of shrimp toast (with egg on top), bone marrow or PBBLT (pork belly, bacon, lettuce and tomato). Gluttonous and divine.\n\nCheck out the menu: http://fatchoylv.com/food, by most people's standards, this food is CHEAP. Depending on the time of day or how busy the kitchen is, there could be a bit of a wait. But really, you can't rush noms like this. Just order a Kirin from one of the waitresses and she'll bring it to you in a tall, frosted mug. \n\nDefinitely not part of the sexy Las Vegas strip, out-of-towners should call a cab to get here. Sure, you could walk but the heat will likely do you in before you make it in one piece. And you won't want to drag a food baby back with you, either. Go here for the non-traditional Vegas foodie experience... certainly off the grid and worth an adventure."

People don't go out in the rain I guess. From my yelp research and with assistance from the server, we ordered the short rib grilled cheese, pork bao, sesame noodles, and a wedge salad (to be 'healthy').\n\nThe grilled cheese was by far the stand out. It was exactly what I wanted it to be. It had that good 'merican taste combined with rich short rib. It came with a side of tomato dipping sauce to cut some of the richness. Maybe it's the Asian side of me, but I would have preferred a pickled veggie on the side, like some kimchi or cabbage to cut the richness. I guess I needed more vinegary than what the tomato-y sauce offered. \n\nThe pork bao was delicious! The bao were nice little fluffy pillows on which the pork belly could rest. \n\nI wasn't a huge fan of the sesame noodles. It was a pretty big portion and I got tired of them quickly. I wanted them to have more sesame oil on them and I thought it also could have benefited from more veggies like cabbage or sprouts to contrast the noodles. But, they weren't bad and I could see why people like them.  \n\nI had a great time at Fat Choy and I'll be back for the really friendly/enthusiastic service, short rib grilled cheese, the bao, and whatever other creative menu items might be on for the day."

He lives by the credo of ordering a restaurant's namesake dish, and his gut served him right again. That was one delicious burger, topped with bacon, short rib, cheese, tomato, and a fried egg.

Thin cut and seasoned with salt and pepper. Get a little burger drippings on 'em, and you're good to go!\n\nOur waitress was super friendly but not overbearing.

Could not revamp my appetite eventhough the burger was really tasty!\n\nLong after that incident, I was in the area and decided to go again. This time I ordered Sunday's special which is Fat Benedict. It's 2 poached eggs, crispy pork belly, rosted english muffins with hollandaise. Sounds good, right? Right, except that the benedict never made it's way to me. I waited for around 10 or 15 minutes before Jenny came and told me that she forgot to put in my order but the benedict will be ready pretty soon. So I wait and I wait for another 15minutes. Then Jenny and the other waitress came up to me and admitted that there's been a huge mistake & they gave my benedict to another customer who just came in. She told me that if I wait again, she'll give my meal for free. Hell no, I don't have the time!

Outgoing, gregarious, and accomodating, she was a gem and we were fortunate to have her help us on our first visit! The only reason it wasn't a perfect 5 was because of a slight lag getting refills, but the other server took care of that as soon as she noticed. Great service!\n\nRoom (4/5)\n\nIt's a pretty small space, but with a lot of quirky charm. You really have to check it out!. Plus my friend noticed they have a small little section commemorating Guy Fieri's visit here. (\"Hey Look! that fat guy with the white hair was here!\")\n\nI like this place a lot. Even though the menu is a bit small, the service and food will certainly guarantee I'll be back for multiple visits!\n\n4.5 stars.\n\nYay! I'm a fan."

Fat Choy still retains the diner look of its predecessor but it's definitely an upgrade from Sheridan Su's former location in a salon. \n\nI've been craving baos all week made worse by a friend who posted a photo of homemade Momofoku-inspired baos. After being turned away at Bacchanal, I turned to Yelp in search of baos.\n\nWe ordered both the duck & pork belly baos (one order is $7 and codes with two baos). I love the duck's crispy skin with the special sauce (the recipe is actually displayed on the wall). The pork belly is braised overnight for 6 hours and is perfectly tender. It's served with mustard greens. My fiance doesn't typically like sour notes in his food but he found the mustard greens to be the perfect counterpoint to the sweet sauce. \n\nWe also ordered the Fat Choy burger which comes with a half pound beef patty, shredded short rib, bacon, and topped with a fried egg! I only had a bite but it was pretty heavy with fatty goodness. \n\nThis is one of the best surprise meals I've had in a long time. I wish they simplified the decor to something clean and classic but the shiny red diner seats won't deter me from going. And it doesn't seem to deter other Yelpers. The food is just so good that I'd love to see them expand. \n\nDon't forget to check the board for specials. I was really looking forward to roasted bone marrow & forgot about it until I saw it on the board while walking out. We definitely will be back!"

            "review": "This started off as a quest to find the Great Bao Truck street vendor with the great reviews on Yelp. It turns out the truck has temporarily disappeared and has instead morphed into a diner style restaurant called Fat Choy in the Eureka Casino.\n\nThe Eureka Casino is an unusual location for the vegas Mecca of Pork Belly goodness. It is a tiny smokey third tier casino filled with just slot machines, most of which are penny machines. It will take you decades to blow your retirement at a casino like this with penny slot machines. It seemed that many of the patrons were doing just that.\n\nThe second thing you should know is that it is not exactly on the strip. It is on the corner of 6th and Sahara, which at certain times of days is more difficult to convince a cab to pick you up than the middle of Death Valley National Park. Don't come here unless you have a car to get back to your hotel. I spent over 90 minutes and a dozen phone calls trying to convince a cab to come out here.\n\nOnce you have dealt with these two hurdles you can look forward to some great food. Fat Choy has Great pork belly and Peking Duck Bao. These are their two signature dishes.\n\nThe Pork Belly Bao is a Taiwanese classic, and Fat Choy does a pretty authentic version. Great asian steamed bread, lots of slow cooked pork belly with the crust of cilantro peanuts and sugar. I prefer a little more sugar crust, but these are the best Bao I have had in Vegas.\n\nThe Peking Duck Bao was also surprisingly good. Perfectly cooked fally duck, with just the right amount of spring onion and Hoisin sauce.\n\nThe Eureka Casino is a very unusual location for a foodie gem like this. I would have expected a Popeyes Chicken or Burger King as the resident restaurant. I guess its synergistic; for the chef the kitchen is more roomy than what you find on a food truck and for dinners, you have tables and a roof. I just didn't see many of the retiree patrons fully appreciating this Taiwanese Pork Belly Mecca as they feverishly work down their 401Ks in the smoke heavy air.    \n\nIf you are a fan of Taiwanese Pork Belly Bao and can survive the journey to a smoky little casino in the middle of nowhere, you are in for a food treat."

I prefer the pork belly bao over the duck bao, but it's all subjective. \n\nThe short rib grilled cheese was ok, not great.

Peach flavor first time, Grape the next cup, and Orange for the third)  Service was excellent, the Chinese lady that served us was a bit aggressive in getting feedback from us for unknown reason, probably because we told her we found this place on Yelp?"

You get 2 pieces for $7. The pork belly is accompanied with relish, cilantro, and I think peanuts. It was an explosive medley in my mouth and definitely something I'd come back for. \n\nNext came the entrees: short rib grilled cheese and sesame noodles. The short rib grilled cheese was accompanied with fries and tomato dipping sauce which tasted like marinara sauce. It wasn't anything to write home for, just plain ol' grilled cheese and meat. The sesame noodles left me in a state of confusion. Although it was flavorful, the dish was lukewarm which had me question whether it would've tasted better hot or cold. I concluded it might've been better cold and if I didn't see how much red sesame oil was left over after finishing the noodles. \n\nService was a little on the slow side, but out waitress was friendly and accommodating.

The smell of smoke from BBQ is good, the smell of smoke from cigarettes/casino is bad. I never made it to the tiny Great Bao location so this was first experience eating any of the chef's creations.  I remember seeing him on TV and enjoyed his story so I felt like I had to try his food. \n\nOn my 1st time the bad casino smoke did a number on me, my eyes were irritated, I had a bad taste in my mouth, and my nose was stuffed. I sat as far as I could away from the entrance but it still had the smell. I originally went with some short rib dish which was about $14 but then I saw that there some pork belly tacos on a chalk board menu for $7 and had them change it.  It was 3 pork belly tacos, slaw, salsa, and fries. I wasn't a fan of any of it, maybe it was the smoke still messing it up. The pork belly pieces were pretty dry and tasted just like cooked unseasoned pork belly. The slaw tasted like the one from KFC which I didn't mine but expected more.  The salsa was bad and fries came out almost at the end when I was almost already done.  Actually I didn't feel like I would ever be back after this visit. \n\nThe 2nd time here went better, joined some friends for dinner. I went away from their special chalkboard menu and ordered the fat choy burger. Most of the tables went with their various signature dishes which included the fat choy burger, short rib grilled cheese, bao, etc. The fat choy burger was enjoyable but I wasn't wowed. It was a 1/2 burger, short rib,  bacon, a fried egg, and the burger usually ingredients between a bun. You'd think with ingredients like that in a burger it would be a freaking amazing but it wasn't for me. I've had better for the similar price. I think it was about $10.\n\nThe 3rd time, whenever it happens, will hopefully be the charm lol. I won't try the short rib grilled cheese, don't think I'll like it but not a big grilled cheese fan and it didn't look I'll like it. Maybe I'll stick with their money item the bao, which for some reason I still haven't had even when I've been meaning to try. The only difficult part is I just have to decide on which baos I'm getting. I also have to remind myself to hold my breath while walking through the casino.\n\nTheir menu and the pictures posted look good. The staff is friendly and the environment is good, besides the smokiness which I heard has gotten better. But for now I have to give them a 3 point something, 3 1/3, 3.33333 with the bar on top Star which is still good, it's Ok and a lot better than that 2 star meh.\n\nThere's some drawings on the wall, it's not fancy but includes things of their past. Double check for specials either on the wall or social media, I'm sure they'll let you know but just in case they don't.\n\nThinking about it I believe I already been here for a 3rd time but I don't remember it. lol"

We had the pork belly Bao x2, short rib grilled cheese, won ton soup with noodles, and the fat choy burger.  We didn't care for the soup as was real salty, but everything else was perfect and spot on. The waitress think her name was Haley was one of the best waitress ever including 5 * restaurants which made the dinning experience even better."

Rather then bore you with painstaking descriptions of each item in an attempt to sound like a connoisseur I'll make this brief; this food is crazy good, the service is charming and the location is ....the Eureka Casino.  I've read some complaints about the prices but I really don't understand it.  Given the quality of the food and a menu where entrees are all around $10 I'd rate Fat Choy as an incredible bargain.   I guess some of the old regulars might miss the $3 breakfast specials but  that was a different restaurant and this is a completely different level of cooking.  As for the Eureka casino the place is a dive but that's half the fun.  When you march your out of town guests through the casino to get to Fat Choy most will try to bail and head to the nearest Applebees.  But after dinner they'll be calling their friends to tell them about their adventure and how they discovered one of the best insider secrets in town.  Seriously the casino is smoky but they seem to be managing things pretty well in the restaurant.  Just ask for a table away from the door or a seat at the counter and enjoy."

Their noodles are legit good. The servers are nice and the price is a lot less there than what you would pay on the strip. Fat Choy didn't send me running for a toilet so I would highly recommend you go there and try it. If your walking there make sure you bring a taser it could get a little hairy!"

It was definitely tasty and nicely portioned for a hungry stomach.\n\nService: Only 1 waiter but she was great. Always checked in on me and refilled my water promptly.\n\nFinal Word: I'd definitely go back if I was in the area."

Okay, that too then.\" \n\"We'd like to start with the potstickers as well.\" \n\"Also, we'll be needing an order of the duck rice to go at the end.\" \n\nAlex Trebek, I believe you're looking for, \"How much do you think two girls can put away?\" for \"Functional Fatties\" for $400.  \n\nI brought a girlfriend along with me to Eureka Casino for a double duty visit to Fat Choy, which I've had bookmarked for the longest time, and Fluff Ice, which was holding a pop up. Yes, the Eureka location is unfortunate, but if you can get past the smoky slots, there's more than meets the menu. \n\nThe service is spot on, but the food takes a while longer than I thought should be expected for this kind of restaurant. The potstickers were crunchy on the outside & juicy on the outside, but definitely trumped by the duck rice and bao. The *LIMITED TIME ONLY!* 3-for-10 deal is a great promo and the duck rice is delicious with the ginger scallion sauce. \n\nI still don't understand what the heck a place like this is doing in a casino like Eureka."

The decor is cute, I don't know why I like it. Food came out fast and it looks pretty good I'm gonna demolish this! Ok the pork belly is really good. The bao is warm and soft and the pork belly is crispy and the flavor is yummy. I ate it so fast I forgot to chew. This peanut lodged in the back of my throat is totally worth it! :) pot stickers are done well. Overall I'm really happy I picked this place for lunch."

I come here for the Pork belly buns and duck buns. Awesome Awesome! So great! Plus the server was great and made the experience. This place is going to be on diner drivers and something from the food channel now in a few months. Come here before it gets to big! This place is awesome."
