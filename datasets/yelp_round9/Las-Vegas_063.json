I had the linguini with clams. The pasta perfectly cooked and the little neck clams overflowing!  My husband had the eggplant and pasta that was to die for!  Then on the to dessert!  We shared a piece of ricotta cheese cake that was smooth and tasty. One of the best I have had in a long time. We also had the cannoli that had great filling and a nice crunchy shell. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. It is definitely a place we will be coming back to time and time again!"

            "review": "This is a nice Italian restaurant in Downtown Sumerlin. I have eaten here at least 6 times since they opened. Sometimes it's just me and my wife, and other times with our (grown) kids.\nWhen it's just the two of us, we usually start with the calamari. I'm not a big fan of calamari, but at this restaurant, I make an exception. I've tried the calamari at Red Lobster, and thought I was chewing a pencil eraser. The calamari here was better than any other I have tried. I actually finished the large portion (I did have help from my wife).  If we go with the kids, we will oder the antipasto platter. Yes, it is pricey, but it's a generous size, and the quality of the meats is first rate. I'm pretty sure the prosciutto is imported from Italy.\n\n  For my main course, I seem to be stuck on the salmon. I really like their spaghetti with meat sauce, and the veal parm is awesome, but the salmon does it for me.  It is always tender, juicy, and flavorful.  It even tastes good the next day for lunch, when I can't finish it at the restaurant because I ate too much calamari or antipasto.  Oh yeah, if you have room, the carrot cake is awesome. Get three or four friends to help you finish it.\n \n I see in a couple of reviews people were complaining about slow service. In all the times I've been here, I have not had that experience.  The staff was very friendly, and the service was professional.  Obviously if the joint was jumping, like on a Friday or Saturday night, it takes a little longer for food to arrive, but that's how it is at any busy restaurant. \n\n  Do yourself a favor, next time you have a taste for Italian food, and you're near Summerlin, check out this place.  They have indoor, and covered outdoor seating.  It's a great location to \"people watch\" while you are enjoying a drink and a great meal."

And the food also is a little high someone has to tell them that they are not on the strip. This is my second time there and I will return after I get a loan from the bank. LOL. Give it a try just bring a little extra cash. The first time I came here I love it and still do. I just don't remember it so pricey."

I will preface this by saying that I did not look specifically at the prices of the wine or the specifics of the happy hour specials. Our bill came to $60! Needless to say I was shocked. I could have gotten 4 bottles (of the same wine) at Costco for that price!! I really do love the atmosphere and have enjoyed their food in the past.  I would go back but definitely recommend checking out a corking fee or have your wine before you go!  The manager stated the pricing is related to the night rental on retail space at this complex."

Ben took ownership and insisted on remaking the dish without it. After my wife was cool enough to say she would just pick it off, Ben insisted and had the dish remade. Wonderful staff, great food, and most importantly to me great service. We highly recommend this new spot at DT Summerlin, we will for sure be coming back!"

Food was large portions, well prepared but I was most surprised by the attentive service. I've eaten at every restaurant in downtown Summerlin and this one just jumped to one of our favorites. Much better than Grape Street both in terms of food quality and definitely in terms of service. Keep it up!"

We ordered the bucatini carbonara, linguine with clams and the eggplant parmesan and all were excellent and large portions.  The garlic bread was great but I would just prefer the choice of just plain old  Italian bread.  The balsamic vinegar and olive oil was good but I asked for butter which was brought quickly. Our server Zeki was professional, attentive and polite.  We were also given a dish of olives, red peppers and hard parmesan cheese to our delight.  We will try it again soon."

We had an appetizer of calamari, pizza di Parma and I had the Veal Francese with pasta. The calamari was pretty good, pizza was good and the veal was just meh. There was an odd taste to the sauce on the veal and the veal wasn't as tender as I'm used to. The real reason for the low review is based on the price. If you're going to charge nearly $40 for a plate of pasta then the dish had better be spectacular. Our meal was $75 for two entrees and an appetizer (we drank water) and the food was anything but special. I can't see coming back with those prices to try anything else."

Coming to Tratorria Regiano reminded me a bit of what I come to expect when revisiting Italy. Good food and excellent service are both on display here. Out waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and specials, which was very nice indeed, but I was more focused on the native Italian busboy who cleared the table and supplied the Reggiano to my party's salads and pasts dished. The man couldn't have been much younger than 70 years old and he was totally committed to making sure our table was always well-attended to. I forgot the man's name but I want him to know that I give the restaurant the extra star for his exceptional service. I had the ravioli and it was made al dente just as it would have been made back home, in Roma. The salad was huge and my friend's plates were delectable looking as well. Buona fortuna, Tratorria Reggiano e ci vediamo subito!"

They didn't have my favorite dish which is chicken piccata but they did have my second which is shrimp scampi so that is the only reason they got 4 stars and not 5 stars. \n\nI started my meal out with their steamed mussels, hot cheesy rolls and with oil and balsamic vinegar on the side. Then ordered their shrimp scampi, the shrimps were larger and cooked to perfection. The pasta tasted awesome with the lemon butter sauce. \n\nThey also have a bar where you can come just get a drink and watch a game or something. \n\nThe service was on point and they made sure you had everything you need, not pushy at all. Sonic your ever in Vegas and want some Italian food, I recommend you come here."

The spicy marinara was delicious. \n We both agree we will not go back but it was okay for a last minute lunch.\n$77 before tip for two people. No salad with the meal. \nWe are Italian, rarely go out for Italian food as it is hard to  find authentic/really good food around here. Can honestly say this is no better than Olive Garden. Olive garden is less expensive and the food is the same quality"

With that being said I would give dining on the patio 2 stars at best. First of all, when I ask about bread and water and the server responds with \"the busser will bring that out soon\" you've already rubbed me the wrong way. Which by the way she brought out 2 minutes later. \nThe food is very mediocre and overpriced for what it is especially, with Grape Street being across the street at the same price and higher quality. \nI had the bolognese- average. The man had what seemed to be a chicken breast and dry pasta couldn't even tell you the name of the dish. \nWe had to ask for our check and to-go boxes ourselves in an empty restaurant. \nShould've just cooked at home."

            "review": "The food here was ok, nothing to write home about.  We had a large party and we got several different items.  The biggest problem I had is why I'm giving them 2 stars - their bartender apparently doesn't know what Blue Moon (the original wheat) is.  They had both the regular wheat on the menu and the \"seasonal\", which is a white IPA.  I told him that I wanted the original Blue Moon, to which he proceeded to argue with me telling me that Blue Moon IS an IPA. He said that they'd been getting people complaining because they thought it wasn't an IPA.  That's because it is most definitely not!!  He assured me that it was the regular Blue Moon so I ordered one.  It was the seasonal.  I didn't want to argue with him any further so I just let it go and someone else at the table drank it.  \n\nI hope that management will take this review into account and train their staff about the difference here.  This isn't an uncommon beer and most places carry it, so for it to taste like a completely different type of beer means that either your lines are mixed up or your staff doesn't know what they're serving.  If you're out of the regular that's fine, but don't try to tell me that something I've been drinking for over 6 years is something that it's not!  Please see my picture for proof of what I'm referring to."

I pointed it out to the waiter, who replaced it, and also had it taken off the bill.  The replacement was ok, but not flavorful enough to bring me back.  I truly wonder if the food quality is dependent on who is in the kitchen.  The reviews go from 5 stars to \"blah\". I also ordered the kale peanut salad which was too acidic for my taste.  The two stars are only for the waiter, \"Giovanni\" who I would give five stars, but I don't want anyone to think it is for the food.  I think management needs to do a better job on what leaves the kitchen and goes to the table."

            "review": "We have been here three times and all three times I have been very disappointed.  The service is great but the seafood dishes have been very disappointing!  The first time I ordered linguini and clams. at least six clams didn't open and the sauce was bland and flavorless and the clams had a very fishy taste and smell.  They did give me additional clams but half of them had broken shells that led me to believe they took the ones that didn't open and just broke the shells to get the clams out. I didn't eat them because if a clam shell doesn't open on its own it is because the clam is already dead and who knows how long it has been dead.\n\nSecond time there I had the shrimp scampi. The shrimp were not over cooked but they were stuffed!?  The breading they were stuffed with were soaking in oil.  There was no delightful garlic/wine sauce it was just butter and stuffing.  So I removed the stuffing and ate the six or seven shrimp.\n\nThe third time I ordered the shrimp and linguini in their red sauce.  The shrimp tasted very fishy again and the red sauce was utterly bland! It was extremely disappointing.  \n\nMy husband had their veal parmesan and said it was good except that the veal wasn't pounded down and the thickness was a little off-putting and a too thick breading covered the veal.\n\nHe also had, on another visit, their carbonara and he liked it a lot and on our third visit he had the baked ziti and thought it was very good but the meatballs were  horrible.\n\nOur friend had the lobster ravioli in a pink sauce.  The pink sauce had a very mild flavor and he said it was okay.\n\nThe garlic knot bread is good and the service is good.  The manager or owners ask you how everything is and we always say it's good but I just don't like to make negative remarks in front of their customers so this review is more for them and I just pray the read it.  \n\nWe love everything about the restaurant but the seafood dishes need a major overhaul and they need to remake their meatball recipe."

Of course we checked yelp and this place drew our attention. It looks rather small on the inside, there was a bar, and outside seating. It was a nice night so we decided to go with the outdoor tables. We got seated right away and the atmosphere was really nice. There was live music and the lady who was singing was awesome. She made the experience really fun and enjoyable. My sister and I wanted to share so we ordered the specialty salad and a pasta. The waitress brought us garlic knots to start, delicious and soft!!! Don't forget to dip it in the oil and vinegar. The salad came out right after and it was huge! Enough to feed three people. They also split the pasta into two bowls for us (how nice, we didn't even ask). The food was tasty we finished it all and it was very filling. We enjoyed this place very much."

The garlic knots were just ok and took forever.  They were dripping with butter.  I like butter, but it was too much for me. The food showed up 30 seconds after the bread finally showed up. We had spaghetti with meatballs which was good but overpriced and a chicken dish, which was good.   The server never checked back and took forever to get the bill much less offer dessert."

Not sure about the free garlic knots with oil and balsamic for dipping? They were already pretty oily. Portions look small for lunch but don't be deceived, it was more than enough food but a little pricey for lunch. I had pasta with garlic, olive oil and cracked red pepper. The chef forgot to add the pepper and the waitress failed to notice so I had to ask for them to bring a shaker to the table. Simple flavors are an indicator of a chefs skill and the pasta was perfect and the sauce flavorful (can't believe they forgot an ingredient though). I'll definitely give them another chance- when summer is over ;)"

The restaurant was clean and the staff were attentive.  The restaurant was not busy(maybe a third full). The food had little to be desired.  The food was no better than the popular Italian chain--they even use the same boxed pasta! We started with calamari which were rubbery and greasy and served with an odd colored \"red\" sauce that was actually orange. I had tortellini with Alfredo sauce which was melted butter mixed with cream and very watery. No herbs or flavor whatsoever.  The tortellini was not house made and over cooked to boot! They were happy to take my tortellini and remake something else but after eating a stick of watery butter from my first bite, I lost my appetite.  My husband ordered veal parmigiana but the waiter brought some odd fried meat with a salad on the top!  Oops. My son ordered chicken parmigiana.  He said it was ok. We were out for a family meal and my son ended up eating alone while my husband and I watched.  Right about the time my son finished eating his meal my husbands actual order came so we got to watch him eat.  Not exactly the family dinner we had in mind.  Very pricey for \"chain\" quality food.  I would not recommend this restaurant."

Great selection of Italian dishes.  I had the lobster ravioli and wife had the linguini and claims.  Both were very good.   The flavors were very authentic. Lots of claims.  Also had the espresso martini that was well prepared (not too strong on the alcohol and a good espresso flavor)\n\nAnother big thing with this restaurant are the complementary garlic knots.  They are great.  They have olive oil and vinegar on the table, but some butter might also be nice.  Also, when we got our first batch, they were very cold and I mentioned this to the waitress who said \"Ohh, they just came out.  So do you want a new one?\"  Yeah, right -- they just came out (15 minutes ago).  Nice try.  The correct response is -- \"I'm sorry, I'll get you a fresh batch right away.\"  But they were replaced with a hot fresh batch about 3 minutes later.\n\nIn fact, if I had any complaint, I would say that our server was not the most attentive (took a while to bring drinks, took a while to bring the bread, the aforementioned breach comment).  The other complaint was the prices -- almost $70 for lunch for two with no dessert and one martini drink (including tip).  A bit pricey, but this is appears to be the new norm in the bourgeois downtown Summerlin area, so I guess its to be expected.  \n\nThe dessert tray looked good (and I would like to try the TIramisu) but I was full so will have to be next time.  Anyway, I will definitely go back and try out some other things."

We did some shopping while we waited, but after 70 minutes of waiting, we decided to see where we were on the list. We got back to the hostess and asked how much longer it would be.  She looked at the tables, said \"Oh, shit\", and explained she was trying to save a table for us but had just given it away.  (How does that make any sense?)  I asked how much longer it'd be and she tells me another 45-60 minutes!  How had we waited that long and not gotten anywhere??  Clearly they had forgotten us and had given away our table.  I would have thought they would try to get us in as soon as possible, or at least offered to reserve a table for a different night, but apparently not.  So not only did they make a mistake, they offered no solution, and did not seem very sorry for making it.  \n\nSo I haven't tried their food, and probably won't due to their lack of professionalism and responsibility.  I recommend not taking your chances with this establishment - might have better luck going to the Strip location."

The \"crust\" was so incredibly thin and floppy and wet and cold that I started to take a photo for this review BUT before I could do that, a woman collapsed in the restaurant and hit her head and wasn't getting up. Please understand this next part and read carefully: I was sitting at the far end of the restaurant and there was a ridiculous amount of servers working in this place. Like two servers to a customer. At least 15. The bartender, servers, hostess, and manager just stood there like stunned sheep, so I was the first person to call 911. After running across the restaurant by myself, they obviously had no kind of training in place for an emergency situation. People acted like I was a hero for merely possessing common sense. After the ambulance showed up and took the woman away, the general manager commended me and comped our entire bill. I explained the pizza issue to him and he acted like he knew about it and was embarrassed, but here's the kicker: the guy was from New York....and he allows his kitchen to serve sloppy cold pizza!?

Not the best I've ever had, but still yummy. Besides, they're free.) I ordered a pasta & a pizza. The baked ziti was FANTASTIC! I really enjoyed the sauce, and it's very very cheesy. I had the Salame Picante Pizza, which was also very good. The crust is really why it was fantastic. It's a thin crust pizza, but not super crispy and hard to eat. The olives are definitely fresh, italian olives. Unfortunately, the food does not make this place worth going to. For a 75 dollar dinner (for two people) I expect MUCH more. \n\nThe reason I'm not giving it 4 or 5 stars is because of the atmosphere, lack of unprofessionalism, and the manager. Our server, who was from North Carolina, did well. No complaints there. My complaint is mostly in regards to the open kitchen and the manager, Dan, who truly does not care at all. With an open kitchen, you must teach your cooks how to behave. When I sit down in front of an open kitchen, I have zero desire to listen to the cooks personal music blasting from their phones. If you're gonna have an open kitchen, you should probably tell your cooks that if theres guests sitting four feet away, the music restaurant should suffice. \n\nSomething else that was frustrating was having the football game on. I personally don't care that the football game was on - especially since it's the beginning of the season. What I do mind is when you allow your staff to walk around yelling \"TOUCHDOWN!\" Again, there are guests here. I paid 75 dollars to eat my dinner in a nice restaurant, not buffalo wild wings.\n\nLASTLY, my biggest issue of all - the manager Dan. When I expressed my concerns, Dan just stood there. After about 30 seconds, he says \"I'll address it.\" Not a \"Im sorry. You're right, that's not acceptable.\" Nothing. I already paid my bill, I had zero intention of a comped item. But Dan is by far the most lack luster, uncaring manager ever. Perhaps Trattoria Regiano in Venetian holds their staff to a higher standard than this location.\n\nIn sum, If you're going to Downtown Summerlin and are looking for a nice meal - go anywhere else. You'll actually enjoy the atmosphere of Shake Shack better."

The food was spot on and really nice for a casual, relaxed neighborhood place.  The garlic rolls are some of the best I've had in town.  For some reason, most of the garlic knots I've tried here in Vegas have not been up to par.  These are the exception.  They're soft and have that stretch and bounce of a good knot, garlicky with olive oil and a sprinkle of Parmesanm and served with extra bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Margarita pizza with burrata was excellent, Caesar salad was tasty with dressing on the vinegary side, kids meals were decent and each meal came with a mini cannoli for dessert.  Meatballs looked great but didn't try. I would absolutely come back for the food.\n\nOk, here's the scoop on the service.  I think we just had an overworked server that day and that person was not at their best.  I prefer to give them the benefit of e doubt bc we all have our bad days.  Suffice it to say, service and attitude were subpar but not enough to complain to management.   In the end, we just wanted to pay our bill and move along.  The hostess and manager were very nice and courteous and greeted everyone at the door.\n\nConclusion:  food's great but the waitstaff could use a bit more training.  We'll be back to try again."

Felt like we were sitting in Italy.\n\n Great place to go right before seeing a movie, it's literally right next door to Regal DT Summerlin. \n\nThey have a Happy hour too which is nice and the outdoor seating is really comfortable a real plus is you can hear yourself talk. Unlike some of the other restaurants in DT it's a great place to connect and meet with friends, we loved it! Service by Paolo was superb, I know I said it again but it's worth repeating. Great calamari, Chicken Parm is one of the dishes they're known for. We had such fun and loved it. See Vito the manager and ask for Paolo you won't be disappointed..."

Arugula with cherry tomato salad was a generous pile of arugula but only 5 halves of under ripe cherry tomatoes.  The waiter recommended the baked ziti with meatballs.  It was swimming in cheese and didn't have much sauce.  That was probably a good thing since the sauce it did have was on the sweet side.  The meatballs with it were bland but ok.  Hubby is a chicken parm addict but he barely touched what they served him, also because the sauce was sweet.  Wine list has nothing under $40.  The wines they have are marked up four times retail.  They were out of the first two bottles we ordered.  The Meomi we buy for $17 in the store is $15/glass or $55/bottle.  Ferrari Cab was $55 too.  Over-priced for a casual spot like this.

            "review": "The original Trattoria Reggiano location inside the Venetian is pretty popular, and has had a 4 star average for as long as I can remember. So, when we first arrived to this new second location, it wasn't too shocking to hear we'd have a little bit of wait (30-45 minutes) even on a Sunday at 7pm. But it wasn't until nearly an hour and fifteen minutes later that we walked in and got seated on the patio of what might be the smallest restaurant in Downtown Summerlin. \n\nUp until we got seated, there had only been one other party that put there name down to wait. In the time that we waited the place really started to clear out, and shortly after we got seated, there was only a handful of tables sat. The place was pretty much dead. But for whatever reason, a table of about 6 people had the whole staffs attention. They had been there the whole time we waited for a table, and were there during our whole meal. Obviously either very close friends, or family of someone associated with the restaurant. Food was coming out to them in waves, and nearly every staff member was waiting on them hand and foot. It took 20 minutes just for our waiter to come over after being sat, and throughout the meal, it didn't improve. Drinks and food took forever to come out, we had to ask for refills multiple times, and the guy seemed to barely know the menu. To put it lightly, the service sucked. Even if every waiter here was new, this restaurant has enough experience that they shouldn't have untrained staff, or even crappy service in general. \n\nWhen it comes to the menu, it looks like it's pretty much exactly the same as the original location. They have a variety of classic Italian dishes, some pizza, seafood, etc. Pricing doesn't seem to be any different, and is about average for this style of Italian restaurant. \n\nWe were brought out an order of complimentary garlic knots. The flavor was actually pretty good and they had good texture, but holy friggin' grease. These things felt like they were made and then just rolled in oil. They also brought a little pepper, olive and cheese tray. It was okay, but I'm glad I didn't pay for either. Not really an impressive start.\n\nI had pretty much already made up my mind on what I was going to order before we even came here. The filet meatballs sound good, and usually get great reviews. So, I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The noodles were cooked well, obviously not hand made or anything, but decent. What really let me down was the meatball. I'd say mentioning filet mignon in the title is just a way to sucker you into ordering them. If there is filet mignon in them, the amount is so little it's impossible to taste. They really just taste like straight up pork meatballs with no seasoning. At $14 for an appetizer order of meatballs, and $18 for the spaghetti and meatballs, there should be no doubt that filet mignon is in them. Their supposed house made pomodoro sauce is alright, but this is far from an $18 plate.\n\nAt this point, I was done and not even thinking about trying their dessert. But most of my table wanted dessert, and oddly enough, it was the best thing about this place. Sort of. They have a \"homemade\" chocolate cake that looks just like the garbage Claim Jumper serves, so I passed on trying that. Their tiramisu was excellent though, and really was the saving grace of the night. I'd literally come back just for that, and would likely try the ricotta cheesecake too.\n\nMaybe I expected too much...but with a pretty dang successful restaurant, in the Venetian of all places, I thought TR would have a lot more to offer. Long waits, horrible service, and below average food just wasn't what I had hoped for."

My family and I eat here quite often.  We love the food and the service.  I don't know what place the writer was in but this restaurant doesn't have 15 people working on any shift.  When the lady fell, the bartender (who was an EMT) immediately rushed to her.  At the same time, one of the servers was doing exactly what she should by calling mall security.  The \"gentleman\" really didn't have to do anything since the staff was very knowledgeable about the appropriate actions to take and took them. \n\nI very seldom write anything on Yelp, but I do read reviews of places we want to try.  It really bothers me when someone writes inaccurate reviews.  That is not to say that things can't be wrong at times with food and service. However, let's at least be honest.\n\nThe food at this restaurant is not New York Italian, but rather, true Italian from Italy.  It is authentic and excellent.  The servers, bartenders, and manager are always helpful, polite, and accommodating.  \n\nI have tried to correct an injustice by explaining the event and stating our enjoyment every time we dine here."

The olives were eh, and the canned roasted peppers were just that....canned...or jarred..whatever. Not fresh made. So, as much as I enjoy free stuff, I like free stuff thats good. I'd pass on the antipasto next time.\nThere were 8 of us so we tried a bunch of stuff. I really enjoyed the eggplant rolatini, that was so good. The calmari were OK, but I didn't think the meatballs were great the way people raved about them. I ordered the fruit de mare pasta dish. It was alright. I'd try something else next time if I decided to come back.

Being pressured to order= I really hate that. It was my first time here,  I needed some time. I was also confused why the host is asking for my order minutes after we sat down? If your host is going to take orders, they should know the specials of the day! Alright, so that was an awkward start...\n\nThey bring Garlic knots that are generous and appear very appetizing. Overly greasy, soggy in olive oil, a raw garlic flavor; lighter on the oil and some nice crisp on the bread would be a big improvement.\n\nFella ordered the meatball sandwich (comes with fries); I went with a Caesar salad because I was already suspicious. (AKA: servers and line cooks talking about their dates last night loudly by my table in a big empty restaurant, doesn't make me feel like kitchen is strong on their game). Our food arrived so quickly I was surprised and a little suspicious (microwave?); the cheese appeared oddly coagulated, melted but not bubbly like a nice toasted meatball sam.\n\nThe salad- flavorful dressing but overdressed and I wasn't a fan of the full anchovy presented on top. Top it off- last bite was a sour tomato. Trying to eliminate that flavor from my mouth, I took some fries from my fella's dish, and sure enough the oil had a strange taste. I couldn't get the strange oil taste of my palette from these fries. \n\nMy favorite things from the experience were the fresh flowers on the table and the Andes mint that finally neutralized the weird fry oil taste."

We went in at around 8:45 and were seated immediately and were told that they close at 10- which is fine. \n\nOur night quickly turned when we met our waitress. She was extremely rude and was reluctant to answer any of our questions. When I asked \"what is the difference between a small Caesar salad and a large?\" She rolled her eyes and said a small is a small and a large is a large.\"As if we didn't already know that. So then I asked another question, \"is a small salad enough for two people to share?\" To which she replied, \"it depends on your appetite.\" ABSOLUTELY NO HELP AT ALL. So we ordered the small Caesar to share and the portion was so small my boyfriend just told me to have it. After this our waitress didn't check in at our table one time. She walked past and would say \"is everything ok?\" But wouldn't even stop walking to hear our answers. \nThis type of behavior would be somewhat understandable if they were busy but we were one of only three tables in the restaurant! \n\nI could go on and on about how rude our waitress was but I think that about sums it up. I will say this however, at the end of our meal when we asked for boxes, she boxed up my boyfriends food and I boxed up my own, which I didn't mind. My boyfriend took his left over baked ziti with meatballs to work with him today and guess what? The waitress didn't put the meatballs in the to go container. \nAfter paying the high prices of the entrees and wanting to take some home one would assume you would get everything you paid for in the to go container but apparently not. \n \nWe went here to celebrate what should have been a great night, but our service was so poor, half way through the meal both of us were upset. \n\nI am in the food industry as a waitress and I usually don't write yelp reviews like this but this was the WORST dining experience I have ever had in my life. \n\nI did give two stars however because the food was good, and the hostess and busser staff were very friendly.

The bread, garlic knots, were actually quite good and I devoured 2, especially dipping in the entree sauces. We were finally given a complimentary olive and pepper dish to start out that was just par. Drinks are expensive and not very good to be frank. I ordered a Manhattan and it was just alcohol thrown into a glass, with no real craft. The house wine is $11 and truly is a house wine. Meal came to around a surprisingly expensive $70. Not worth the cost in my opinion with service underwhelming as well. But nonetheless a strip type of restaurant in downtown Summerlin."

We had a wonderful server by the name of Ricki - we weren't sure what to order and she recommended the lobster ravioli which was what we both ordered and it was fantastic. We then had to have some dessert and our server Ricki recommended her favorite- tiramisu- well now it is my favorite!! So glad we decided to check out this place - will definitely be returning when Ricki is working and asking for her recommendations again!"

It looked really nice inside and because of our Italian craving, we found this spot to be something new to try. The food was presented wonderfully, but the taste just doesn't match its good looks.\n\nTo be honest, this was nothing special. Their food, for the prices that they were, didn't seem to really be worth it. My pasta was mediocre, our pizza was as well. \n\nI think the one thing that stood out was the really friendly customer service from our server for the evening. She was very attentive and accommodating. While we waited for our food she brought us out a little tray of cheeses and olives to snack on. \n\nI don't think we'll find ourselves here again, but it wasn't a bad place. Would I recommend this to anyone else? No, because it wouldn't be the first Italian restaurant to cross my mind, BUT if someone were to ask me if they should eat there, I don't think I would try and dissuade them."

I don't necessarily think that the place has bad service overall, for I witnessed our server take great care of the tables around us - offered fresh pepper, cheese, refills, dessert, etc. None were offered to us, we had to chase her down for refills and remind her the kids meal came with dessert. But what really puzzled me was the portion size of my entree. My linguine with clams entree was smaller than my 2 year old's spaghetti from the kids menu. Both served in the same bowl that's only slightly bigger than the small bread plate. We were excited to try their dessert but we never got that far. I normally base my reviews mostly on the taste of food and just explain my experience with service and ambiance, but the service was just THAT bad."

Our server, Theresa was very nice and very pleasant. The restaurant is small and quaint but felt authentic and welcoming. We couldn't have been happier with our experience, and will definitely be returning soon...especially since it is our new favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas.

We ordered the eggplant rollatini to start, which was wonderful. We were pleasantly surprised when they brought out garlic knots as their bread and an amuse bouche of Parmesan hunks, olives and roasted red pepper slices. I had to deliberately not fill up before my entree came out. I ordered the tortelloni and they were perfection. Delicate, flavorful perfection. I speculate that they hand make them because of how well they were cooked. My husband had the gnocchi and he thoroughly enjoyed that dish. We will definitely be back.

The garlic knots and an antipasto plate were very nice, however the salads we ordered were entr\u00e9e sized rather than starters-would have preferred half the size at half the price. The Kale salad with peanut dressing was difficult to eat as it was very spicy and very heavily dressed. The Margareta pizza my husband ordered which comes with no cheese (lactose intolerant) was COVERED in capers which were not mentioned anywhere. That is a very specific ingredient that serves mention on the menu. He is not a fan so rolled most off and ate half. I ordered salmon and vegetables-the preparation was fine although a lot of oil appeared on the plate mixed with the lemon sauce-not a fan of that much oil. The vegetables were heirloom squash and zucchini-really cute vegetables! Overall just very hefty priced and neither of us was impressed with our items. Perhaps the pasta is the way to go as there is a very authentic vibe-but we'll pass on by next time in Downtown Summerlin."

The outdoor patio has comfortable seating and  has some privacy from the adjacent foot traffic. Ceiling fans and overhead heaters make this a year round venue.\nOur party of four chose the patio on this evening. We were seated immediately and welcomed by several staff members. Our server Amanda was attentive and helpful. She had a up beat attitude and I felt that she was truly interested in providing us with great service. Amanda along with her associates  followed up throughout the meal. \nThe complementary dinner rolls with bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar were provided  for the table. We ordered the Filet Mignon Meatballs as a starter. The three large meatballs were plenty for sharing. The shaved Parmigiano Reggiano was offered as a topping. Four different entrees were ordered. Eggplant Parmigiana was  layered in traditional pomodoro sauce and lots of melted mozzarella. The Chicken Caesar Salad included several large pieces of grilled chicken. The Lobster Ravioli was topped with shrimp, sauteed in a pink sauce and white wine. The ravioli pillows just melted in your mouth and the shrimp were tender and juicy. The Chicken Francese was a breast sauteed in lemon-white wine sauce and a touch of butter served with spaghetti. Both the Eggplant and Chicken Francese were especially large and resulted in some to take home. All of the entrees were cooked perfectly to our satisfaction. Freshly shaved Parmigiano Reggiano was also offered as a topping for the entrees.\nTwo desserts were ordered for sharing. Ricotta cheese cake was moist with a long lasting cheese flavor. The tiramisu is served in a goblet with two sticks of cookies. The saucer on which the goblet sits has drizzled caramel sauce. The location of the caramel adds eye appeal but scooping it up is not easy. I would rate the tiramisu as just OK. \nOne note on the restrooms. A restaurant this size should have more than one restroom. As I waited in line a server mentioned that there is a public restroom next door to the restaurant. The woman behind me decided to check it out but she returned to say the line at that one was longer."

The waiter checked on us periodically and they brought a complimentary veggie/cheese dish which was ok. The garlic bread was never replenished that was given in the beginning. The calamari smelled awful - too fishy. I wanted meat with my dish and they couldnt add it for extra. I had to buy meat balls on the side just to pair it with something. My friend's spaghetti and meat balls were plain sauce wise and my other friend's white wine pasta dish was not appetizing at all. Ended up spending almost $200 between the 3 of us. There was definitely nothing special about this place. I dont mind spending good money on quality italian but I think its more hype than anything else. Overall mediocre. I dont think Id come back again. Im usually not a complainer/nit picker but for someone who loves Italian food and doesnt mind forking out the money it was a big let down."

The patio seating with live lounge music is a nice place to hang out during the weekend...make sure to place reservations. The singer will politely ask for your favorite songs but then play her own lol...it's her thing :)\nA bottle of wine and great service from Sam and Daniel, the manager, plus the Garlic knots make this place worth revisiting.\nThe food is lackluster and overpriced but TR's crowd doesn't seem to mind.\n\nChicken Marsala, Veal Piccata  - Both very pedestrian. I think these dishes cater to the older crowd that doesn't like bold flavors but enjoys shuffle board. It reminded me of something I might get at a buffet. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend TR to anyone that wants good Italian food or knows how to cook. But if you want ambiance and don't mind making a meal out of the Garlic knots, then this is your place!"

This time I would have given 1 star but like I said Beth, the bartender, came in and made the experience so much better with her great personality and social skills. Ricki our \"server\" was not attentive, OVER charged us, did not bring our antipasto (I had to ask the manager for it). We were there early, at 4pm, when happy hour starts. I recommend waiting until the bartender comes in at 5pm. The restaurant was not busy, there were us and 2 other tables, 6 people total. If you can go Wednesday through Sunday Beth works then, she is amazing. So helpful, always recommending, attentive, pleasant, sociable, etc... Just a fabulous gal all around. This is what I want when sitting at the bar. The kale salad was fabulous, as was the pizza. Last time we were here the Bolognese and calamari was fabulous. The food is outstanding, but Ricki is horrible. If you hate your job, stay home!"

I didn't care if I wreaked of garlic or that I'd be sweating it out of my pores the next day, they were pretty damn good. As for the rest of the stuff I tried... meh. The menu is typical Italian-American food, the kind of stuff you'll see in a million other spots. Perfect for the non-adventurous eater -- the kind of diner who thinks not eating at a national chain is a bit risky.\u00a0\n\nThe kitchen plays it safe and turns out unremarkable food. Meatballs ($14) made from a filet mignon and pork loin mixture were too hard and dense with a sauce that lacked depth. The small portion of the kale peanut salad ($8) was plenty to share, but the underdressed dish had me reaching for water to wash it down. The end of the meal took a turn for the better with a satisfying, but uninspired, lasagna ($22) with ground filet, ricotta, and mozzarella.\n\nKid menus are available as well. My son's spaghetti (ordered sans tomato sauce, just butter) was a sizable portion that he devoured. Each kid's meal comes with a beverage and mini cannoli.\n\nLocated steps away from the movie theater in Downtown Summerlin, it's a nice looking space with a large patio and a smaller than expected interior, with a bar and open kitchen. The food is more paint-by-numbers than Monet, but is just good enough to satisfy a suburban customer base used to eating recognizable Italian.\n\n2.5 Stars"

There's a lot of options for Italian in downtown Summerlin, but I was curious to try this place out after walking past it so many times- I'm glad I did. I tried the Chicken Parmesan and pepperoni pizza, so delicious! Their marinara had excellent flavor and they immediately give you garlic knots upon sitting down, (mouthwatering) but be careful not to get full before your food comes! Portions are on the larger side and the restaurant is nice but not elegant, perfect for just a casual date night or dinner with family. Also, friendly staff! I was one of the last tables and didn't feel rushed at all."

I now realize that that was filled with tourists, most likely one-time only patrons. The food here was kind of flat and monotonous. The marinara sauce is bland. This is a beautiful restaurant if a bit pretentious. I get a sense that this place is run by a heavy-handed egotistical owner or manager that cannot see-through to its problems. I watched the management while I was dining here, and they seemed stern and unaccommodating. Our waiter was very friendly, almost too much so. I will probably try it again, just in case I was there on a bad day. All in all however, I was disappointed."

The waiter said that the chicken was going to be dry. I said that I would rather have it be dry than to get sick from all the oil and dairy. When the food came, I was surprised to find out that my chicken was breaded. I don't understand why they would give me breaded chicken with gluten free pasta. The waiter never came back after that, so I tried to take off the bread unsuccessfully and ended up giving the rest of my chicken to my son. He got the linguine with shrimp pasta with a watered down sauce that he said was disgusting. $85 later, I feel like I was robbed and have a stomach ache. I wonder if that pasta was really gluten free. My recommendation is that you don't go here and go to the many other places around."

While the service was good it was not as good as last time.  Last time they brought out a plate of cheese, roasted peppers and red, green and black olives that were fantastic.  This time there was only one of those green olives on the plate and when I asked the waiter for the more and for the other colors he found a few more green ones and said that was all there were which I find hard to believe.  Last time the garlic knots were wonderful.  This time they were very doughy and undercooked although very brown on top.  I had the same meal, baked ziti and while last time it was delicious this time I could hardly eat it.  The other meals were just ok.  Nothing to rave about like our last visit.\n\nTowards the end of our meal they sat a very large party behind us although there really wasn't enough room and the waitress kept bumping into me every time she had to get through.  At one point she told me I needed to move my chair in.  If we were not getting ready to leave I definitely would have said something.\n\nI also think that either the prices went up or they have a higher priced menu because it is during the holidays but I can tell you that we probably will not be going back there."

Restaurant was clean, staff was about as friendly as you could reasonably expect with a packed house on a hot Vegas night.  \nHere are a few, admittedly minor, critiques. - our waiter was an older gentleman, with a thick, we thought possibly added on and emphasized for 'authenticity' accent.  He clearly struggled with the whole placing the order via iPad thing, especially when one in the party ordered something he wasn't familiar with (but was on the menu and no changes were requested).  - The pasta e fagioli was certainly nothing to remember, which is disappointing with the 'we're in DTS so we can overcharge' pricepoint on all the dishes. - and one of my pet peeves, they didn't bring all the entrees out at the same time.  They brought three and one in the party had to wait for a while until theirs arrived.  \n\nNot sure if I'll go back.  Food was solid (save the soup), but the price was rather high for what you get and there are better Italian options in town."

We plan on visiting for dinner prior to our future date night at the movies.  The restaurant is literally right next door to the theater.  Service is top notch!  We started with a drink at the bar so we would have a chance to look at the menu.  The bartender was very gracious and answered our questions about their specialty drinks and wines.  After looking at the menu we decided to have dinner and were promptly seated.  Our waiter was right there to greet us and answered our menu questions.  He also asked if we were seeing a movie so he could time our dinner if necessary.  I ordered my fave, eggplant parm which was awesome.  Perfectly cooked and not loaded with cheese.  My better half had a kale salad which was actually very good.  I rarely order healthy dishes but may rethink this as the salad had a great dressing and was a nice change from the standard caesar.  The manager Vito stopped by twice to check in on us and offered us a complimentary plate of olives and cheese which was a nice touch which you rarely see these days.  My only complaint is the lack of restrooms.  They only have one unisex restroom which is located in a busy hallway so it was bit awkward with a couple of us waiting in line.  I have already recommended it to friends so I would give it try.  You will not be disappointed."

This one is much closer to home. \n\nService: Our waiter was Jason. The poor guy seemed so stressed and the entire restaurant seemed understaffed. First downside. Jason was great though. Even though he seemed rushed, he was very attentive and quick to make sure our drinks were filled and our food came out in a very timely manner. \nHis manager or whomever the older gentleman was at the window for food was not. He kept yelling out at the waiters. Which I felt was insanely unprofessional because that window is right next to tables. This is a very open restaurant and you can see all of the cooking staff. \nThere was a time that Jason was taking our order and the manager yelled out \"Jason! Order up!\" And Jason kind of glanced over at him to show him that he was in the middle of taking our order. \nWho does this? I don't know. But I hope he sees this and realizes that it makes him look horrible and the restaurant in general. \nAlso, hire more people or staff appropriately. We went during prime time, 7:30ish. You should be fully staffed. Otherwise, you have a bunch of waiters running around trying to serve a ridiculous amount of tables and people are going to start to get frustrated. \n\nFood: I wasn't really that impressed. The calamari was good, but a bit too peppery. The marinara was very good and very flavorful. We also had the lobster ravioli and the lasagna. \nRavioli...it was good. It was probably my favorite dish. But the lasagna kind of lacked in flavor. It was very mediocre and pretty plain. Which in my experiences in Las Vegas, it's all roughly the same for lasagna for some odd reason. \n\nThe restaurant itself isn't very large. They have a nice sized patio if you want to dine outside and they do have a nice selection of wines. The best was they have a nice description of what the wine is, so that is very helpful. We had the Barbera D'Asti. I highly recommend if you like red full bodied wines. \nThe prices we reasonable as well. \n\nOverall, I'm sure I'll go back to try other dishes. It's a nice location and another good addition to the Summerlin Downton Mall."

We started with a couple glasses of red wine recommended by Bethany. They were exactly what we were looking for.\nWe only wanted an appetizer to share and Bethany recommended the meatballs. This was a good choice as the meat was flavorful and the pomodoro sauce was divine.\nAt 7pm the live music started and it was a great touch. Hi quality lounge music I would call it. \nGreat food, great service, great atmosphere.\nWe'll be back soon!"

In the summer time the ambiance is even better as you can sit on the outside patio. The price point is reasonable, you can find several dishes priced from 18 to 40 dollars per plate. \n\nThey also have a large selection of items so there is not an issue finding anything you would like. The size portions were very generous, I would say most people would have a hard time finishing their plate. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli which was very good. There were large pieces of lobster all over the dish. The sauce was tasty and the ravioli was perfectly cooked. \n\nIf you are looking for a simple but tasty dish I would recommend this dish. Overall, the food was good but not memorable."

Now I understand why she told me she's too busy to help me. So I sit at the bar and wait about 10 more minutes for my pizza. I ask for red pepper and she tells me \"if you want some I would have to go next door and get it\" (next door is also their business).

Three large meatballs, tender and juicy, covered with a yummy marinara sauce.  Very good, and well worth the cost in my opinion.  I ended up ordering the gnocchi, and the host/other waiter heard my order as he walked by and actually exclaimed, \"Oh!  The Gnocchi!  Yes!\"  I thought it was pretty funny.  He was right, too, though.  It was a large bowl filled with gnocchi and a basil pesto sauce that tasted as good (or even a little better) than it looked.\n\nThe rolls were good, and the price was very reasonable for everything as well.

There are so many cooler restaurants on the strip such that I cannot recommend going here unless you happen to be walking by and are in need of Italian. Again, solid food, but was not memorable and the restaurant had a cheap ambiance."

The ravioli was huge. \nTheir pizza and garlic bread rolls were also very good, though the rolls were a little cold.\n\nThe service was fine, though the host was not as friendly as he could have been. He was a bit condescending when I didn't know how to pronounce the name of a pizza, and was quite unresponsive. \nOur other server was great, though."

We were seated as soon as we arrived, and drinks were delivered rapidly. That was about the best part of the rest of the meal. Five of us ordered various salads and one ordered a pasta dish. We waited more that 40 minutes for our food. Once arrived is was good but certainly not worth the wait and not a place to consider for a work related lunch if you are short on time."

There were about 6-8 small tables outside, and 2-3 booths inside. The ambiance was interesting, it was somewhat an authentic italian feel but was off put by the venetian traffic walking by. The staff was attentive but seemed hastened. Nevertheless they were very sweet. \n\nOur noms:\n\nComplimentary Bread: Garlic knots - should have been a bit warmer. I'm a seasoning nazi and I think if they added more seasoning to the dough and added lots of garlic it would be delicious. Outside was very buttery. I took these guys home and baked them and added some garlic seasoning which made them bomb!\n\nStarter: Fried calamari appetizer - Large portion, lightly breaded and fresh tasting. Not bad but not the best i've tried either. Marinara that came with it was warm but strange. I had to add some more s + p + crushed red. I'm starting to think I just have a salty tongue! \n\nEntrees: I can't help but get pasta at every italian restaurant I come across. The man got the spaghetti + filet mignon meatballs. He thought it was OK, but then again we are spoiled by Enoteca Adriano in San Diego's spaghetti and meatballs. (Best i've ever had) For filet mignon meatballs I thought they would be moist and tender, they came out a bit dry. Spaghetti was nothing special. \n\nMy entree: linguini w/ shrimp in white sauce. This usually comes with clams but I had a bad experience with eating clams far from a coast. I loooved this. It was light and refreshing. Linguini was perfectly al dente. I finished the entire thing and even mopped up the sauce with some garlic knots. A squeeze of lemon and fresh parmesan made it even better! (refer to picture posted) \n\nAll in all, I would come back for the linguini. 3.5! Ohh the struggle of rounding up or down for a 3.5 star place. I'm gonna have to round down because of the boyf's lackluster spaghetti and meatballs. Sorry guys!\n\nHonorable mentions: Olive oil + balsalmic were absolutely delicious. They were obviously imported. Yum. \nNote: Pasta dishes ranged from $18-28. $18 being the most basic pastas, so I would say it is almost towards $$$.\n\nHappy eating! xo"

I suggest looking for Brighton or the Coffee Bean and you \"should\" be able to find it.  Was all excited to eat here after reading other reviews but it fell short of my expectations.  I ordered the chicken parm and it came with a small side of spaghetti.  The spaghetti was delicious.  The chicken had a reheated chicken taste to it and I did not enjoy at all.  My hubby had pasta puttenesca.  He ate it all.  Was enjoyable but not fantastic.  Two glasses of wine, our two entree's and and iced tea was $65. Maybe I didn't order the right thing but wont be returning... sorry.  The service was pretty good.  Everyone was extremely friendly but the food just didn't do anything for me.

Add to the experience an intimate atmosphere (yes, it is possible to find intimate atmosphere somewhere in a hotel restaurant on the strip), a personable chef and staff, and a sense of authenticity (not post-modern authenticity, but the actual authentic kind).  We go to Vegas to do two things:  play poker and eat.  And we pack a lot of both into each trip.  It's safe to say that for all of our eating in Vegas, Trattoria Reggiano has no rival.\n\nWhen you go, it might be tough to find in the maze that is the Venetian.  Head for the food court in the canal shops.  It's a few doors down from the food court seating area, but don't let that fool you.  Fake al fresco is fine, but for a nice quiet meal, see if there's a table inside.\n\nAnother online review that says it all, by \"pepprdine\" on yellowbot.com:\n\"The Best of las Vegas.  Trattoria Reggiano is one of those street side cafes that you think of when you are strolling down the streets in Italy. Instead of traveling to Europe you can now just visit the Venetian to find this outstanding restaurant. Excellent service, original menu and true Italian owners who care about their heritage are just a few of the reasons you should visit. Acclaimed Chef Jack Borruso is there most days and nights ensuring that every diner is satisfied. If you end oup visiting the restaurant you need to sit down with Chef Borruso and let him tell you some of his stories about cooking in Italy. You can sit there for hours listening.  You can go to those other \"trendy\" restaurants in Las Vegas and take out a second mortgage on your house to pay the bill and you might be satisfied or you can go to Trattoria Reggiano and get a taste of what a true Italian Trattoria conveys; chbefs visiting your table, authentic Italian Cuisine, smaill, intimate atmosphere and a menu that is better than most high end Italian eateries in Vegas without charging you so much that it would be cheaper to fly to Italy and dine in Rome. This is a must visit when you are in Las Vegas. \""

I think there were maybe 3 booths inside and the rest were tables set up in/outside the main storefront.

As an appetizer, my family and I ordered the Fried Calamari.  This could have been a meal for one.  Luckily we shared it.  Unfortunatley, it was a bit too fried.  The sauce that accompanied the Calamari was good, but I wouldn't have minded had it been spicier.  We ordered two personal pizzas to share.  Although the pizzas are thin, they are large in diameter and declicious.  We ordered a Margarita pizza and a Prosciutto pizza.  While the Margarita was good, the Prosciutto pizza was excellent. \n\nOverall, our experience was very good.  The food was plentiful and very tasty.  The staff was cordial.

When he took my order, I said \"I'll also have the pasta BOLOGnese,\" I was craving pasta.  When our orders came, they got pasta dishes and I received something piled deep under green leaves.  Turns out he heard me order the Veal MILANese, and then he gave me attitude about it. Dude, you just recommended some bolognese stuff to half our table and I said I would also have that!  He did offer to replace the item, but I was too hungry to wait and didn't want my friends to wait for me to finish whenever I did get my replacement order, plus I already angered the guy that brings the food, so I wasn't going to risk it.  Conveniently for them, the Veal Milanese was one of the pricier entrees...\n\nIt should be a sign to you how good the food is that I gave them 4-stars despite my little kerfuffle.  Seriously, it was not easy trying to maintain a pissed-off front while eating that rather great Veal Milanese.  A lot has been mentioned about the quality of the bread, yes, it is also really good.\n\nThe pizzas aren't necessarily great, they're alright, we shared one as an appetizer, didn't really leave me craving more, I didn't even try to fight for the last slice.  Also, and this is very European of them, they serve the tiny-bottled sodas, meaning refills aren't free, and that is annoying.\n\nTo recap: great bread, good entrees, meh pizza, tiny sodas, and a waiter you should be REALLY clear with."

The chicken Caesar salad was ok, the chicken had a VERY grilled smell to it, very strong, not sure why, but the chicken was also a tad bit dry. The cheese on it was yummy though, and I expected to see a smaller salad but it was meal sized. The caprese salad was just ok , the cheese was fresh and moist,the tomato was ripe,but I added a little balsamic vinegar to up the flavor . The shrimp linguini was not too bad, not as much sauce as I expected and a smaller plate than I expected but I was still satisfied and got full. They gave us soft garlic bread in the beginning while we waited for our food, it was good with and with out my dip(olive oil,balsamic vinegar and black pepper).

While purchasing tickets at one of the discount ticket booths on the trip for a couple of shows, we were offered a discount at this restaurant.  We walked to Ceasars (granted it was mid August, so we were in shorts and sweaty) to go to dinner and didn't have time to change clothes. When we arrived at Trattoria Reggiano, we were graciously greeted by the host.  While the host was grabbing menus for us, a server walked up to the host stand and rudely rolled his eyes at us and then he whispered something to the host.  Luckily we didn't get that rude server's section.  We were served by Paolo.  He was EXCELLENT.  Gave great suggestions, didn't snarl his nose up at the fact that we had a discount dinner ticket and treated us with respect (even though we were casually dressed).  He made our dining experience pleasant.  The reason I left off a star was because I asked for a specific pasta (penne) but I got something totally different (fettucine) but Paolo graciously apologized.  I will go back next time we are in Vegas."

I always have low expectations with Italian restaurants, but I knew this place would be a winner after they brought out the bread basket. Top notch! I ordered the linguini cabonar I believe, it was delicious! I also tried the spaghetti and meatballs which was also tasty. Overall it was some of the best Italian food I have had and completely a hidden gem."

The waiters were incredibly sweet older Italian gents who were all attentive and friendly. We ordered the special (last night it was handmade cheese ravioli topped with buffalo milk mozzarella) and the gnocchi al pesto. Both dishes were flavorful and the fresh pasta for both dishes was amazing. The gnocchi was up there with the best I've ever had, the texture was creamy and a little chewy (exactly how gnocchi should be!). The pesto was creamy but not too rich. The meal also started out with garlic knots, mmm! We ended with a piece of the seven layer chocolate cake. I rarely get dessert but this cake was pretty good. A little too rich for my taste (ended up having to take half of it with us) but it was still very decadent and moist. \n\nA+ food and A+ service. I loved this adorable little restaurant and will be back the next time I come to Vegas!"

Make sure you call about 30 minutes before you actually want to pick it up though as it does get busy here at dinner time as it's not a fast food joint. I'd love to sit and dine at this quaint little place in the Venetian if I could ever find time.\n\nFun little extra? All the workers have pretty thick Italian accents and are extremely friendly! Although it makes ordering via the phone a little difficult at times.\n\nBoth times I have gotten the Tortellini Alfredo. Medium chewy pieces of tortellini stuffed with delicious cheese in an extremely buttery cream sauce. The portion for this is a bit deceiving visually when you first get it, it seems small, but it will definitely fill you up! Plus, the free garlic knots that come with it are delicious and are a wonderful vehicle for you to scoop up any remaining sauce you have on your plate.

I stayed at The Venetian Resort in Las Vegas this week and did a bit of research regarding their restaurants before traveling there. I then checked Yelp to see what was written about them--everyone was spot on! The Trattoria Reggiano was just what I was looking for--their eggplant parmigiana and baked ziti were wonderful. The garlic rolls that start things out are fabulous but also very filling , so go easy on them. I wish their wine selection was a bit broader though. I did enjoy a \"Nero d'Avolo\" (Sicilian wine) by the glass which was quite tasty--but, their selections overall were really limited. \nWe split a large cannoli for dessert and had a few Peroni's to wash everything down.

They're good.  The pomodoro sauce that the meatballs are served in is delicious but even without the sauce, the meat is tender, juicy and is filled with subtle flavors. \n\nPenne in Vodka sauce - I had to get my alcohol in some how, even though it was only 11am.  The penne was cooked to al dente perfection, sauteed in a pink sauce with bits of prosciutto.  The prosciutto pieces are very small, so if you want some meat, make sure you opt in on adding the grilled chicken, shrimp, or meatball to your pasta order.\n\nGnocchi al Pesto - How do you say it? GnoKki? GEenotchi?  Doesn't matter, because once you start eating, you wont be saying anything except, \"MmmMM.\"  Probably one of the best gnocchi I've ever had and the pesto sauce is not too watery, not to thick -- divine.\n\nI wish I had enough stomach room to try one of their desserts, but their good sized portions filled me up.\n\nThis place isn't \"cheap\" but it's so worth it.\n\nSo, why didn't this place get a 5 star rating?  \nThe bread.  \nI am the queen of carbs and I love my breads.  The service bread looked like it would be amazing --buttery, golden brown, with parmesan.  But it was actually fairly dense and it wasn't warm.

Among the many shops and little stores within the Venetian, Trattoria Reggiano may only catch a glimpse of your attention because of their \"outdoor patio.\" It's more just some tables set up nicely outside. Not bad, but I think they do that just to seat more people. Inside the restaurant seats just a few parties because there are about 10 small booths more or less. Their kitchen is tiny! Their ambiance definitely catches the intended theme of an \"Italian street side cafe.\"\n\nIt's a cute little place if you're craving some Italian food. Great garlic rolls, almost drenched in the oil and seasonings, some might complain. But I personally really liked it. We ordered the margarita pizza, and a pasta dish that I cannot recall the name of. But neither of the dishes were memorable and I really can't see myself ordering anything other than the basic spaghetti or Alfredo the next time I go there.

We're ignored the entire time while she's laughing with coworkers. We put in for appetizers, and when she finally stops ignoring us and comes back to the table, her response is, \"So are you ready to finish ordering or what?\" I'm glad I had my back to the kitchen because my husband saw them literally opening a bag of pasta to serve! My lobster and his shrimp were frozen. The lobster was so chewy it was barely edible and the shrimp were very minuscule.

I think you can tell a lot about the skills of a chef by the taste of their most basic dish, and the spaghetti and the meatballs are out of this world, which tells me they know what they're doing! i've also tried the caprese which was amazing, the carbonara (to die for!), the aglio e olio YUM, and their veal milanese, which they graciously topped with a ton of prosciutto when we asked. \n\ni'm the type of person who tries not to go to the same restaurant twice, but this place i will be visiting EVERY SINGLE TIME i'm in vegas."

It's a tiny restaurant with a few tables inside, and several more tables \"outside,\" if you can call it that (but not even in the fancy Grand Canal area).  It really felt like I was eating a fancy dinner seated in the middle of the mall.  The service was spot-on, but that can't make up for their more fundamental shortcomings.  Next time, I'd rather eat at a restaurant with classier ambiance, like Canaletto along the Grand Canal... or at just about any Carino's or Macaroni Grill..."

The linguine was perfectly al dente, the quality of beef was on point and the portions were perfect. \n\nThere are a few things that I feel could be worked on just a bit and they are all service oriented.  First, I thought it was a nice gesture that they wanted to place your napkin on your lap for you, but, the first napkin was dropped on the ground and we were told they would get us another and well....she never came back.  Needless to say one lap was napkin less and the other didnt even get the attempt the first did.  Second, our server really looked like he hated his job.  I get it...you work at a trattoria in a mall in vegas.  I can see where you get the feeling of despair, but please, PLEASE put a smile on your face.  Aside from these two small things everything else was great and I would come back and dine here again.  After all, we aren't always on point and we do all have a bad day here and there."

It's a small place, feels like you were tucked in a side street in Rome, not like the expansive Maggianos down the street. Its in the back of the blue sky area. Very reasonable prices and wine list too. Our server, Sergio, was the real deal,  from Italy, who knew the food and wine inside and out. We had meatballs, cabrese and the calamari for apps ..perfect way to start off. Meatballs were outstanding, as was the cabrese. \nTheir pasta dishes were on the mark, pasta primavera... very light and fresh.\nThe pizza was cooked perfectly, the dough a bit thicker that typical romano style but quite tasty the Quattro Stagioni was great. They have many good choices of pizza and pasta. We stuck to the pasta /pizzas mostly. Chicken parm was good as well. I'd definitely recommend this on the strip."

Said tables are technically out in the shopping area, but it didn't feel like it.\n\nOur server was great. He was actually honest about recommendations and would say something wasn't as good if we asked. He was attentive and friendly.\n\nI went for a classic four-cheese pizza, which was enough for me and really could be shared between two people, which would help save you some dough. It was really tasty all around-good sauce, good crust, good cheese.\n\nIf you're around the Venetian and are looking for middle scale Italian restaurant, this is pretty solid choice."

Super casual lunch, nothing too wowwing about it ambiance wise, but i had an amazing salad, we got the chicken parm again, and the garlic bread knots - wowwie so good.

Very casual feel, small place, but absolutely amazingly delicious food, charming server, and just an all around authentic traditional italian feel. From the olive oil and vinegar on the table for fresh bread, the delicious sauce, their tiramisu - delicious. 3/5 of us got the chicken parm - it was delicious. Salads were great and shrimp scampi meal also great. If you're staying in or near the Venetian, you've got to go here. I had just a wonderful experience... thanks to Yelp, because that's how i found it!!"

Someone in our party ordered a pizza with chicken and the waiter forgot to add chicken, then brought us a side of chicken after they were finished eating the pizza. Plus the pizza wasn't very good (the 90 second pizza place in the food court was better). I ordered a pasta and wasn't very impressed either. It wasn't bad but wasn't anything special. After eating (keep in mind I split a plate) my stomach felt terrible as well.    Overall I would suggest looking for a different Italian place.

I've been to many Italian restaurants since but nothing comes remotely close to this place. It's a fairly small and quaint location hidden within one of the most beautiful hotels. It usually has a lengthy wait because it's fairly small, but it's definitely worth it. The staff was very nice and remembers my friends whenever they go back.\n\nI had the Spaghetti Puttanesca with no anchovies and asked for broccoli instead. They brought broccoli on the side and it was the best steamed and sauteed broccoli I have ever tasted. I have tried so hard to replicate it because the chef gave us the recipe but there has been no comparison. The garlic rolls were delicious, we kept fighting over them and the server would keep refilling them.\n\nThe food tasted like what Italian food should taste like. I think this is the closest I've been to authentic. I can't wait to go to Italy if this is what authentic is. \n\nI definitely can't wait to go back. I miss this place.

Tables were close together but I have to admit I did not feel crowded in there. I do believe we scored a very good table in the small patio area - we may have gotten really lucky there. We were seated promptly, server was prompt to our table and overall very pleasant.\nOk, let's talk food now, shall we? One of the main reasons we decided on Reggiano's was the hailed filet mignon meatballs, so that was a must order item for us.  We ordered the appetizer meatballs and before even trying them, I was brave (and confident) that ordered some more in my spaghetti entree, since I decided to go simple and take full advantage of the raved meatballs. I'm afraid I couldn't tell you what the fuzz is all about. The meatballs we simply OK and nothing to write home about (yet I am writing about them here). Equally blend and unimpressive was my spaghetti entree. Expecting to taste a traditional and flavorful sauce, I felt I was eating something only barely better than a fast food joint pasta plate.\nI do regret not having the opportunity to try some of the other entrees mentioned, but I did try the tortellini with chicken in alfredo sauce and that is a plate I can stand behind. The chicken was perfectly cooked, soft and juicy and was an excellent to the delicious cheese-filled tortellini. I was not alone in this verdict, as we all shared our plates (as any sensible family would do). This makes me regret not ordering a chicken based entree, but I hope to get the chance to try other recommended plates on the menu in the future."

But I liked the feel, it's a cute place.\n\n- Our waiter was great. I asked for a wine suggestion and he gave it to me. It was a house wine, nothing amazing, but I did like it better than the cab that my friend got, which was my alternative, so that marks it as a positive. He also joked with us, was very nice and courteous, just all-around good service.\n\n- The food was very good. Granted, I was really hungry, so part of the satisfaction was certainly just getting food in my stomach. My friend got the chicken francese and I got the baked ziti. We semi-shared (I gave her a 1/4 of mine and she gave me a 1/4 of hers). I enjoyed both dishes, although maybe the baked ziti a bit more than the chicken.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place.

I could of had the bread and wine and called it a day...but I didn't...good thing.  We had the warm spinach salad with goat cheese and it was perfect as well as splitting the Linguine Alle Vongole in Marinara... littlenecks very fresh (lived in Boston for last 4 years and these smelled and tasted like the ocean) and perfect arrabbiata style marinara.  Cannoli was crunchy and filled on location.  Espresso not that great for a place that has so many italians in it, compared to the places in italy i've had coffee, but slight oversight maybe.  Being so close to our neighbors I made a comment about the caprese looking awesome...and they gave me some, I felt rude but I ate it anyway because it was really good.  Moist mozzarella, red soft straight from garden smelling tomatoes and large pieces of basil with same awesome Balsamic....it was a perfect mid lunch/dinner and will go again when i'm back up in Vegas."

My wife (who is Italian and makes homemade sauce (or \"gravy\" as they call it) loved her spaghetti carbonara. I ordered the veal parmesean and the portion was HUGE. I only planned on eating half of it, but due to it being so good (combined with a weakness I have of overeating) resulting in me eating the whole thing without even realizing it. Our server was very friendly and attentive and if you are ok with the restaurant's location / relaxed atmosphere (that other reviewers capture quite nicely), this one exceeded the expectations of someone that cooks with family Iitalian recipes, and let me tell you, THAT is tough to do!"

            "review": "We went here for dinner.  \nStarted off with garlic rolls were good.  Virgin Olive Oil and Balsamic vinegar were provided on the table for dipping.  The Balsamic vinegar was sweeter and not as acrid as the one from DOCG.  I accompanied my meal with a Moretti, an Italian beer and really liking this over Peroni.  There is less of an aftertaste and more pleasing to my palate.\n\nOrdered the Linguine Carbonara.  I wanted to taste it so I have a reference of how it should taste.  Most comments online say why order it when you can just make it at home.  They are correct.   Most restaurants serve carbonara but they often add heavy cream and a whole bunch of other items.  Trattoria Reggiano was the only one I found that serves it how it is should to be, Pancetta, Cheese, Egg, and Pasta, that's it.  Overall, the taste was close to how I make it so I'm glad I'm in the general vicinity.  The criticism I have though is that they a used a little too much pancetta and the sauce could have been a little looser.  Additionally, there was little or no black pepper.  Should have asked for freshly cracked black pepper but instead used black pepper on the table, which didn't add much.\n\nMy friend had the Chicken Marsala.  It was very good.  The dish overall was not greasy.  The sauce had a lot of flavor.  Unlike a lot of Chicken Marsala we get in Hawaii where they use too much butter/oil where it masks the Marsala and chicken flavors.\n\nRegarding they other parts of the meal, service was ok.  It lacked in the beginning but picked up later on.  Didn't really care to eat outside in the mall as the tables were too close to each other.\n\nI would highly recommend this place if you are looking for simply Italian food."

Located in a small quaint spot underground the canal-- tried this place since we had resort credit for staying at the palazzo. There are many Italian spots in the Venetian and palazzo-- but I highly recommend this one if you crave Italian!\nFrom the fresh garlic bread-- you'll want more! My husband ordered the lemon chicken-- which the only thing was the portion-- I guess he expected more- although the taste was on point. I ordered the linguine bolognese-- mind you, not a fan of spaghetti, but this was delish! It had chunks of filet mignon meat , in which I thought was just ground beef. The portion was huge ! Had my husband finish half of my plate. I recommend you come here If you want to try !"

            "review": "Why?  Why did my yelp app point me to this place among all the other Italian places in LV?  While I cannot answer that question, I can tell you that we were not fans.  First, the service was terrible.  Our waiter was un-friendly and abrupt.  After we were seated, he came to our table and asked if we knew what wanted to eat.  He never asked us for a drink order.  We had two friends join us who had already eaten, and in the time it took our waiter to come over they were able to walk over to the coffee bean, order drinks, pick them up, and enjoy them.  \n\nSo we ordered, and we placed our entire order at that time - drinks, apps, entrees and desserts.  Then we waited.  And waited.  And then we got our entrees with no appetizer.  The waiter seemed pissed off, and made a comment about the kitchen staff.  Well, what about his job of checking on our table?  Ugh, annoying.  So we canceled the appetizer order and just ate the main course.  We had the pesto gnocchi.  It was bland.  The gnocchi was nice though.\n\nThe bread was also delicious, if not a tad bit oily.  But still, warm and yummy.  Our friends ordered dessert and one of them liked the Tiramisu, but the other did not.  She was expecting a layered-caked style tiramisu, vs. the layered in a glass tiramisu they received.\n\nThe atmosphere also brings this review down a star.  The majority of the tables are set up in the hallway and it makes it feel like you are eating in a shopping mall food court.  Lots of people milling around staring at you while you eat, from an arm's length away.  Not really what I would call charming ambiance.  \n\nThis was by far my least favorite meal in LV, in terms of service, food and ambiance."

We ordered burrata and calamari for the table which was good - not the best I've ever had but still tasty. However the bread they gave before the meal was delicious, I had to stop myself from eating more.\n\nI ordered the carbonara as my entree and thought it was fine. Its obviously a very heavy dinner and was good but it's not something I came away from thinking \"wow, I need to have that again.\" However everyone at the table all really liked their dishes so I'd go back and try something different  They portions are generous and almost no one finished their meals. \n\nOne thing I didn't like was the atmosphere. The restaurant is completely open to the mall with a small gate closing it in and tries to give a neighborhood-esque feel. However, the amount of foot traffic and noise outside the restaurant really doesn't allow for that."

I definitely had to get myself to \"not judge a book by its cover\" with this little joint because on the outside (to me at least) it looks like a strip mall food court venue.  Once you step in however, the service and care that is given to both the patrons and foods really makes you feel loved.\n\nThe Garlic Rolls are wonderful, soft and flavorful and quite honestly you can really get filled up fast on them, so be careful!  I had the Spaghetti with Bologna, noodles were perfectly firm to the touch and the sauce was very fulfilling.  \n\nMy wife had the clam linguini and they did NOT skim on the clams at all--I think that probably will get a good 5-7 more clams than you're normally used to !!\n\nI must say however that the dessert is nothing to write home about, I was really having a sweet tooth and decided to splurge on dessert.  Bad Idea IMO, the $8 dollars could've been better spent elsewhere, the cannoli I ordered was way too rich and dense that I really need coffee to break it down.  Next time I come here, I will skip the dessert and save they money.\n\nAll in all the dessert was the only downside and it wasn't that big of an issue, just don't get it :) 4 out of 5 stars, great service, great food, great place to get lost in!!"

Sat inside (only a little claustrophobic but not bad), hubby had veal parmigiana (the biggest piece of veal ever and absolutely delicious), I had the shrimp scampi and we shared a caesar salad - no room for dessert but would have liked to have tried one of the many choices and John was attentive and had a sense of humor (hard to find in most of the stuffy Vegas restaurants).

I am extremely picky when it comes to eating at Italian restaurants, and I am highly critical when reviewing said restaurants. \n\nUpon arriving, we were promptly seated and pleasantly greeted by our server. The service reminded me of what they offered back in Italia with the tables being out within the walkway of the Venetian itself. The tables were already set up with flowers,placemats, and silverware ready to go. I must say the environment and ambiance seemed to quite right to me. \n\nAfter being seated, we were brought garlic bread that tasted pretty awesome. I ordered the chicken parmesan while my boyfriend went for the slightly more fattening veal parmasean. We opted out of ordering alcohol- they had a fairly extensive list that consisted of both domestic and imported choices- so that we could allocate our funds to dessert instead. \n\nOur food came and was absolutely delicious. It wasn't dry but both our meats were tender and juicy. We had pasta and pasta sauce on the side, both of which did not overpower the veal and chicken. The sauce atop our meats too wasn't too much- just the perfect amount, along with the cheesy mozzarella slice.\n\nWe had to box the remainder of our meals, and order our cannoli to go, because we were stuffed to the brim. It's a good option though so you can return to your room, let your food settle, and enjoy a nice, romantic dessert later.\n\nI would recommend this place if you are in the area. Sure, it's a little pricey, but it is well worth it. Great meals in Italy are not cheap; the same rule applies for the states. You won't be disappointed!"

Trattoria Reggiano was the one place I found that was neither.\n\nIt's a very little restaurant tucked between the food court and the shopping in the Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian.  There are maybe 10 or 12 tables total.  It serves what I call Italian comfort food.  Generous pasta dishes and hearty bread served just like a neighborhood Italian restaurant in Anytown, USA.\n\nIt was $40 for two of us to eat.  We had Linguini Alfredo and Shrimp Scampi.  Both were tasty and filling.  The service was polite and non intrusive.  No back waiters, no captains, none of that; just a guy who might own the place who's happy to feed you whatever you want, and then leave you be to eat it until you want him next.\n\nTwo thumbs up for casual Italian with no fuss!"

We did our research and hit the jackpot.\n\nThe restaurant is currently being remodeled/expanded and so we sat outside along the mall walkway. This was great for people watching.\n\nThe rolls are hefty, buttery, garlicky and delicious. But the real reason to come is the authentic and fabulous Italian food. \n\nThe filet meatballs are as awesome as advertised and worth the price of admission. The chicken parmesan and lobster ravioli were fabulous.\n\nIf there is better Italian food in Vegas, I would be suprised."

            "review": "My girlfriend and I were seeing the Blue man group and needed a place to dine before the show. We were in the mood for Italian and happened to stumble upon this little joint. It's rather peculiarly located-- as though it's purpose as a restaurant was an afterthought in the tiny enclave's design. It almost feels like a genuine old fashioned mom and pop-- if it weren't located in a major strip resort. It's a quaint and intimate little dining experience with all the decorations you need for a casual italian dinner.\n\nAesthetics aside, let me simply say that I give this place my stamp of approval. The bread is tasty, and the food arrived fairly promptly. Our waiter seemed to be an authentic Italian immigrant who had an excellent knowledge of the menu and provided valuable dining advice. My girlfriend went for the tortellini and I settled for the swordfish piccatta. The food arrived promptly and did NOT disappoint. The swordfish was succulent and the seasoning was just right-- so as not to overpower the flavor of the fish. Delicate capers draped over the fish helped me finish my portion in no time. I tried some of my girlfriends dish as well and was pleased to find that the alfredo sauce was rich and well crafted. The portions are just right to fill an average appetite and you probably won't have leftovers. For the price I paid I was quite satisfied with the quality of the food and would recommend it to anyone in the area."

Unfortunately all of the places she wanted to go to had long waits and we just wanted someplace to sit down and eat good fun. We were almost ready to eat at the food court when we saw this small italian cafe right next to the coffee bean. I looked at the menu and the prices were perfect, with everything under 15 dollars, best of all, no wait and we were seated immediately. Instantly garlic bread balls were brought out and they were amazing. The service was incredible, it felt like we were in someones home even though we were a few feet from the food court. We split a caeser with nice big chunks of italian cheeses along with a simple pasta and it was the perfect meal. I recommend it to anyone who just wants a place that is nice, easy and reasonably priced."

A waiter came up to me, didn't say anything, and then turned and left.  Another waiter came over and showed me to a table on their \"patio\" along the Grand Canal Shops at the Venetian.  The tables are very close together in this area and as has been stated in other reviews, this is a high traffic area.  I tend to like people watching so I didn't mind the traffic.  It would have been nice if I didn't have to pretend not to hear the conversation of the two women at the table an arm's length from me.\n\nI was brought a menu and asked about drinks.  Soon a server came with three cheese and garlic rolls and some balsamic and EVOO which he left on the table.  My iced tea was brought and I ordered.  Asking the server what was the smallest appetizer, he suggested the caprese.  I ordered the caprese and the pesto gnocchi.  \n\nThe caprese was OK.  The tomatoes were hot house tomatoes and not very flavorful and a bit hard.  The burrata was quite good.  The pouch of cheese pulled apart and I could place it on the tomato slices.  My server had done some freshly grated pepper on the caprese and that helped.  The best appetizer would have been simply the cheese with some bread and EVOO and let the tomatoes die on the hothouse floor.\n\nThe pesto gnocchi was pretty standard.  There wasn't a strong pesto flavor, but the gnocchi were soft and tasty.\n\nAfter dinner, the server brought me a tray of dessert replicas and I chose the tiramisu.  It's done in a manner you don't see very often.  Instead of a cake like dessert, this version is mostly cream with lots of chocolate powder and some pieces of cake and chocolate near the bottom of the cream.  This was the best part of the meal.  The cream was perfect.  My only complaint is the dessert was served in a fluted goblet, but in the manner of drizzling syrups and sauces over dishes for looks, the plate on which the goblet rested was lined with caramel sauce and confectioners' sugar.  Why decorate a plate on which there's no food?  In fact, I got part of my hand on the caramel and I needed to find a washroom after I left to wash it all off.\n\nService was good except for the start.  The place is OK but it's not a place I need to return to for Italian food.  Too many choices in this complex alone."

The second time was last week, and my entree this time was just okay.  Nothing special.  However....I have to rave about their caprese salad with imported mozarella cheese.  It was awesome!  My wife and I just returned from a two-week Italy tour, and we ate all Italian food and drank a lot of Italian wine.  We had our share of caprese salads, and I tell you, Trattoria Reggiano's caprese salad is as good, or better, than those served in Italy!  It is worth recommending.  They use imported buffalo mozarella, and it is wonderfully delicious.  You must try it, even if you're so-so on tomatoes.  The combination is terrific and not to be missed.\n\nAs for an entree, I would suggest maybe ordering something with a sauce other than tomato based.  Their pasta is very good al dente; I just think a sauce other than tomato-based gives more suble taste and texture back to the pasta dish itself.  Next time I'm here I'll try the veal.  \n\nDo not be dissuaded from trying this Trattoria from the setting.  Yes, it is in a hotel mall next to a magic shop and a Coffee Bean, but the food is good and it is run by genuine Italians.  Not as expensive as the numerous famous chefs' restaurants at the Venetian Hotel, not in as nice a setting, but the proof is in the pasta and sauces. Give it a go; I don't think you'll regret it.  Sit \"outside\" and people-watch.  And don't forget the Caprese Salad!"

Not knowing how to get to this establishment we relied on the directory. BIG MISTAKE. no joke it took us 20 min to find this place. After asking, and looking at several directories ( that show \"you are here\" backwards from where you really are). At one point my wife and I were tempted to just eat any place, but it became a game to find this restaurant. Once here it was smaller than expected and kind of exposed to the mall. But we were happy to find it! \n\nThe service was superb! Wish I remembered our waiters name. A younger Italian gentleman. Super nice, checked on us at all the right times. Overall very good service. \n\nFood: we both had Caesar salads that were very good. I had chicken parmesan which was great and my wife had chicken Marsala. It was honestly very good food. \n\nOur bill came and it was \"cheap\" for Vegas, around $80 or so. Considering we had great service and good food I put $120 bucks in the binder and we finished our drinks. Our waitress took the bill, asked if we needed change and I said no you're all set. 2 min later he walked pasted us and thanked us which was nice. As we left he made it a point to thank us again saying he really appreciated it. I wasn't looking for that, but it was very nice of him. \n\nI recommend this place.

Located in the Venetian shops, it's definitely worth it to get there a little earlier than you want to eat because there is sometimes a line, but they're expanding which I think will be great for service. Amazing garlic rolls with fresh Parmesan, garlic and butter! You won't be disappointed!"

I ordered steak and it was sliced up at serving but it was really moist and flavourful.   Others in my party were pleased with the pasta. The large antipasto however is not good. Prosciutto, cheese, olives  were good but mortadella  and salami do not constitute a good antipasto. Too many pickled peppers just to make the platter look full. All around it was all good."

This restaurant seats maybe 25 people tops with table in the restaurant tightly packed in and a few tables set up outside the restaurant in the mall area for you people watchers.  Yes, of course I'm a people watcher and who wouldn't want to be while your in Las Vegas.\n\nI decided on the spaghetti and meatballs but as our server took his sweet time bringing us our waters, I had changed my mind and now it was set on a pizza.  They brought us bread which was really very good bread.  We made a dipping sauce with olive oil and balsamic vinegar which was on the table.  Holy Cow, that balsamic vinegar was delicious!  Our server said that the balsamic vinegar was brought in especially for this restaurant.  Very nice.\n\nSo, the table next to us ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  It looked and smelled fabulous.  I was pissed I didn't order it.  I know they ordered it to rub it in my face a little, just kidding.  Seriously it looked awesome.\n\nAs I sat there being mad at myself for changing my order last minute, here came our server with our food: Marghertia Pizza, Pizza with Pepperoni and Mushrooms, and the Tortellini Alfredo.  One word = Delicious.  \n\nThe food was really good!  I highly recommend this place.  Our server was from, Siciliy and was extremely authentic.  If you are shopping at the Venetian and your stomach starts to growl, check this place out.  One thing I did pick up on while I was in Las Vegas.... the Italian food is absolutely amazing.  I will definitely return to this restaurant on my next vacation to Las Vegas!\n\nCheers and Enjoy!"

As luck would have it a table for two opened up and we were able to be seated right away!  All-in-all, not a bad dinner, but it didn't blow either of us away.  I think it was because of our selections...\n\nStarted the meal with the FANTASTIC garlic knots... boy were they tasty.  We then shared the meatballs and chicken marsala.  The meatballs were very moist and flavorful and the sauce was top notch.  The chicken marsala is were we had the biggest issues.  It simply lacked flavor.  There wasn't enough marsala and the chicken itself wasn't seasoned.  The accompanied pasta was bland as well.  After that miss, we skipped on dessert.\n\nWith all the great restaurants in Vegas, I'm not sure I will be back to this one.  It's a shame we didn't have a better experience, since there are great reviews.  That's why I think we just made a wrong choice with the chicken..."

What better place to celebrate family than in an Italian restaurant, am I right? Well, today I was sadly mistaken. \n\nThe place was half empty despite being a busy Saturday in the Venetian. We were seating immediately after our arrival and an older waiter came to our table to drop off the menus as well olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Not the friendliest of greetings, but I let it slide. \n\nWhile we were waiting to decide on our meal, I asked our waiter for some bread (thought it was odd we got the oil and vinegar, but no bread) to which he abruptly replied \"bread comes to the table after you place your order\". What's this all about? Was he afraid we were going to dine on free bread and water?!? Anyways, we then placed he order and things got really awkward. \n\nAfter waiting for our food for a few minutes, the waiter came to our table, literally dropped my girlfriends plate in front of her from about an inch above the table top, and set my plate as well as my brothers. He left without a word. \n\nUpon a closer look of my dish, something seemed off with the ingredients, but before asking I thought I would try it. This dish was bland, tasted of canned sauce and was not what I had ordered. Before I could even say anything, the waiter rushed to my table, took the fork from my hand and then pulled my dish of the table... without saying a single word. \n\nThat was it for me. I raised my voice and asked him what was going on only to hear him utter the words \"the chef made a mistake, I'm fixing it\". While I appreciate him trying to fix it, his gross demeanor and terrible attitude interrupted the mood in the table, and upset everyone. To add insult to injury, the manager came over and tried to brush the incident off by justifying the waiters behavior and telling me not to worry about it. Not worry about it? Why would I be worried? I didn't do anything wrong!!!!\n\nThe worst part of all? The manager was within feet of our table the whole time, and he apparently knows this waiter is terrible. \n\nDO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE!!!"

I saw the owner, or someone in management, walking around and talking to some tables. I was hoping he'd stop by mine, but it looked like he was just stopping by familiar faces. I almost always order eggplant if it's on the menu. I must say I was very disappointed.

The atmosphere is a little mall/foodcourty (then again, so is all of Vegas), but the food is definitely well above that caliber.  The meatballs are made out of filet mignon, so expect some high end protein in your spaghetti.  They also make legit carbonara--no canned cream sauce.  It's a hair off four stars; it would make the cut if the ambiance was a little nicer.  I would eat here again if I ever make it back to Vegas, but I hope to avoid that."

He was very friendly and nice, and spoke with what seemed like a legitimate Italian accent! \n\nThe overall atmosphere was authentic and cozy feeling, with light Italian and classical music playing. \n\nI ordered the linguini bolognese and it was served promptly. It was nothing spectacular but thoroughly satisfying. The bread they served was pretty good too, brushed with garlic butter, but not as warm as I would've wanted. Overall a great place with above average food at reasonable prices!"

The food came out super quickly which was great because we were definitely hungry! \n\nThey started us off with some complimentary bread - soft, fresh, cheesy, and oh so fluffy! A wonderful start to the meal! \n\nWe ordered the meatballs as an appetizer. This came with 3 generously sized meatballs. PACKED with flavor and high-quality filet mignon and pork loin. Delicious but a little on the salty side! The meatballs came with lots of marinara sauce, making it perfect to pair with the bread! \n\nFor pastas, I ordered the daily special - a penne with pine nuts, spinach, sundried tomatoes, and tomato sauce. I asked for the penne to be replaced with spaghetti and they did it with a smile! This was simple, nothing spectacular, but definitely memorable because THIS WAS HUGEEEE! It came as a mountain and I was overwhelmed by how much there was. Thankfully boyfriend was around for me to funnel most of the mountain too! \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the linguine bolognese and I loved his dish so much more than mine. Delicious, high-quality bolognese paired so wonderfully with the perfectly cooked linguine. Definitely recommend this dish! This also came as a mountain of pasta. \n\nYou will not leave Trattoria hungry at all!"

Secondly, I'm not sure why she mixed the two but the pre-party might have had something to do with it.  Lastly, I had to try it out and it wasn't as bad as one might think.

We were supposed to go to a fancy restaurant but doing all that walking inside the Venetian with my heels was a killer and when I went to take a break I saw bunch of tables and seats out in the middle of the walk way... figured it was close enough, so we tried it. Best decision ever! It's a little weird because it's self seating but it's still an adorable venue. It's also a delightful place for people watching. The staff was super friendly and fast. I ordered the baked ziti... and let me tell you it was the best baked ziti I have ever tried! The pasta was cooked just right and the cheese wasn't too overpowering and the sauce mmmmm have no idea what made it so different but I'm not going to question a good meal. And the best part of the dinner was the bill! It's completely affordable place with amazing food, please try it! Def coming back here when I go back to Vegas!"

The best part about the meal was the bread... Now that was delicious! \n\nOur server had major attitude. Told me to \"chill out\" when I was trying to move items on the table to make room for the food, then he spilled Parmesan cheese in my drink. When I asked for a new cup he rolled his eyes and told his busser, someone had put cheese in my drink and \"I want a new one\" like he was mocking me. It was just bizarre. He seemed miserable. Anyway... There are way better places to go for Italian in Vegas. Checked this one off the list!"

We did not have a reservation, but the hostess was friendly and told us it was a 30 minute wait. We put our name down and we waited maybe ten minutes tops before she texted that our table was ready. We were sat and our waiter came over. We explained that we were still pretty full from all the good food of Vegas, but that we wanted to split the chicken parmesean. We chose to not get anything else, and to drink we had water. The waiter took our order, and then he spent the rest of the night giving fantastic service to the table next to ours, while ignoring us completely. A couple of helpful bus boys brought out our garlic rolls, and then later our waters. The female manager brought out our meals which they had split for us, and she grated fresh cheese onto our plates. The food was delicious, and fresh. We loved every bite. We finished our meals entirely and the bus boys cleared out plates and still our waiter had never checked on us. He arrived to ask us if we wanted dessert and then gave us the check. We paid with cash and left. The two stars is for the great food and the little bit of good service we did receive, but clearly if you get the wrong waiter and you are not dressed to impress, and buying tons of food, do not expect to get good service at all. Such a disappointment."

Sure we still did some walking, but it was nice and cool amongst the marble laden hallways. \n\nAfter viewing pictures on Yelp of the foods served here, we we're insatiably curious to taste them for ourselves. Our tummies were VERY happy with this choice and so were our wallets! \n\nTrattoria Reggiano is a hole in the wall, tucked away within the Grand Canal Shoppes. Although it has a limited number of booths inside, the seating spills out into the hallway, creating a street cafe effect that seems both authentic and quaint. \n\nWe sere seated immediately and we dove right into the menu. And the garlic balls! We both started with wine, ahhhhve cooooourse. To share, we split the meatballs.\n\nOh, the MEATBALLSSSSS. So tender. So simple. So hot. So meaty. Smothered in the house \"gravy\" or \"marinara\" sauce, these went perfectly with the garlic balls served complimentary. The best things in life, come in ball form. They almost always come as a pair too. \n\nFor our entrees, Mama went for the chicken marsala and I, the carbonara. \n\nMine was so rich, creamy, and the right amount of salty bacon. Although I was extremely full from the meatballs and bread rolls, I don't know how I scarfed this amazing bowl of pasta down, but it was DAMN DELICIOUS. \n\nWhen all parts of a restaurant (ambiance, service, food, timing) come together in serendipitous unity, it's pure bliss.

Served with olive oil and balsamico.\n\nBoth the appetizer and the entrees were excellent. The swordfish came with a nice choice of vegetables and potatoes. The soup with beans and pasta had a nice taste and bit."

It definitely is a hole in the wall, it took our group a while to find it because it's so small! The owner is a very nice, cheerful Italian man who makes you feel right at home. Their complimentary bread rolls are just...I don't know, they're just beyond delicious. Smothered in garlic and full of flavor, plus they were unlimited (not sure if they usually are, but we had a rather large group of 10+) so we definitely took some back to the hotel with us. Our entrees were great as well, truly delectable. You really cannot beat authentic Italian food, the dishes are cooked with care. I was beyond satisfied with my meal, and we left a hearty tip. Will definitely go here again when I vacation in Vegas again :)"

There was a guy singing pretty good covers on the patio but not loud as to impede normal conversation. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and helpful with the menu. I ordered a glass of pinot grigio, a caprese salad and spaghetti carbonara. The wine was dry and crisp, perfect for what I wanted. The salad came out first. Large everything; tomato slices, basil leaves and a ball of fresh mozzarella the size of a billiard ball. The tomatoes were as you would expect in the winter, the cheese was divine. Overall above average for the salad. The spaghetti carbonara was exquisite. Flavors, textures and smells all worked together to produce a fine dish I would order often. Good ambience, great food and friendly staff all come together extremely well. Highly recommend."

The positive thing about going back is that they have expanded the physical restaurant and so it was much easier to get a seat. It just didn't feel the same however. I always loved the 2 Italian men that would serve us and they were nowhere to be seen. Maybe it's just me, but I kind of miss the ambience that used to be there.

But we enjoyed ourselves nonetheless. \n\nHubby ordered calamari- for $15, the portions were HUGE, and he said they were cooked perfectly! I got the marinated balsamic basil chicken salad for $16, which was one of the only gluten free items on the menu. It was delicious! The olive oil is some of the best I've ever had, and I couldn't stop pouring it on everything. The rolls that come out gratis are hot and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Hubby also got a moretti beer- his favorite!\n\nAmanda our server was so sweet and accommodating. I really appreciate how knowledgeable she was about the menu, especially with my severe gluten allergy. She made sure I knew exactly what was safe to eat, and what wasn't. I truly appreciated her concern. \n\nUnfortunately, the other waiter working the lunch shift yesterday, a tall thin man with spiky hair, was so rude to everyone, yelling at his tables and then yelling right next to our table when the hostess seated a couple in his station, screaming that he couldn't handle any more tables and that someone needed to help him! It was so sad! I'm so glad we had Amanda as our server and not him; he would have ruined our meal. \n\nThe espresso is illy but it's watery and not worth the $4.50 price point. It does come with a mini cantucci though. \n\nThe other disappointing thing about the restaurant was the horrifically rude floor manager/hostess, in a brown striped top with brown hair. She yelled at us when we asked about gluten free options before sitting down, as if she couldn't even waste her time talking to us, and told us to leave- thankfully Amanda saved us and said that yes there were gluten free options, albeit few, and that she'd be more than happy to help us."

I guess I must be a little jaded because I grew up in an small town area of New York where probably half, maybe more, of the restaurants were owned by Italians. When I first walked up to this place I was a little reluctant to eat here. In fact, after looking at the plates on the tables my friend and I kept on walking. However, we couldn't make a decision on where else to eat so we turned around and went back. Oops! (why didn't I listen to my first impression?) The dinner rolls that were served at the beginning of the meal were cold and tasteless. I certainly hope they were not the garlic rolls that I see praised in several reviews. If they were then they must have forgotten the garlic with these rolls. The only redeeming part of my meal was the eggplant rotelli appetizer which was rolled up eggplant with ricotta cheese covered with a pomodoro sauce. If I was forced to eat here again then this is what I would order.  The meal I ordered was Chicken parmigiana. I guess I must have strayed too far from their mainstays on this one. The chicken was very tough. It tasted as if it was frozen the heated up in a microwave. The pasta served with it was covered in the pomodoro sauce which actually is uninspiring but goes well with the eggplant and ricotta. The pasta also tasted like it came from the microwave. In fact, the past was so hot I cannot see how it could have been made any other way. It didn't dawn on me that an Italian place could not at least make an edible chicken parmigiana. \nThe service was okay, but I would not call it a friendly place. I guess their goal is to serve 5% of the people that walk by their establishment at least once in their lifetime which is enough to make a go of the business. \nIf you ever spent time eating at restaurants in Italian areas back east then run as fast as possible away from this establishment. \nBy the way, this was $37 each even though we split an appetizer and had no drinks other than tap water. It was a horrible waste of money. This is definitely not a $$ place if you are ordering a meal. I guess it fits the bill if ordering a pizza."

We didn't want to take leftovers since we weren't headed back to the hotel room for a while so we ordered a dish to share. The Eggplant Parmigiana was delicious! The dish was the perfect size for 2 people, especially since they give you DIVINE complimentary bread to munch on while you wait for your food. Divine! Divine, I say!\n\nThe place is really small, only has 6-8 booths & tables inside and about the same number crammed into a space outside. The slight cramped-ness adds to the cozy feel though, I really liked the decor and atmosphere. The walls are lined with pictures of old-time Italian people (just like Buca di Beppo, except better because it's not like the \"Illustrated Archives of Italy, c. 1800-1950\" threw up on the walls like at Buca...of course the food here is 20x better as well). \n\nThe staff are really great, friendly and attentive without being overbearing. It's funny, our waitress so resembled a b&w picture of an Italian woman on the wall that we wondered if they were related. We forgot to ask though!\n\nThe cannoli was amazing. Our waitress gave us a great suggestion for wine too, and they were really nice about the fact that the mister brought in his own beer that we picked up at a bar on the strip. They even gave him a proper mug for it so he wouldn't have to keep drinking it out of a plastic cup!\n\nNext time we are in Vegas we will definitely be back!"

Location isn't great...I suppose that is how they keep the prices down. \"Outdoor tables\" are actually inside.

At the end of our meal he was so carried away with his buddies that he had totally forgotten about us, and need to be retrieved by a bus boy. \nThe Caeser Salad that we shared was good.

Place is super close to the regular suites in the Venetian or Palazzo. Located inside the grand canale shops, the place is actually pretty small. Large groups might take time for them to accommodate without reservations. \n\nI had the lobster rav which was pretty bomb. Sauce was tasty but wasn't overly heavy and lobster chunks were meaty. Also had a bite of the spaghetti meatball. It was bomb too. I think I had a small bite of some other stuff and just remember everything being bomb. Including the unlimited garlic knots. Holy shit they are good. Just remember to triple rinse your mouth with listerine if you're clubbing later.\n\nIf you even remotely enjoy a good pasta and aren't trying to break the bank, come to this place. Also the manager talked like super mario. What more can you ask for."

It's a family run business and authentic Italian as they're actually from Italy, including the wait staff. They made great recommendations and we loved all of them! I ordered the linguine fruti de mare (clams, calamari, and shrimp in a spicy marinara) while my mom orders linguine in clam sauce and my aunt ordered the swordfish piccata style with steamed vegetables. I loved my dish and I usually don't like red sauces. I also loved the swordfish, the piccata was so flavorful and perfectly cooked! The garlic knots were also really great, which came free! We ended up ordering the tiramisu for dessert even though my aunt was hesitant because the example looked really creamy. It was really creamy, but surprised us in how delicious it was! It was a light cream and my aunt was glad we ended up ordering it! I was happy to hear that they would be expanding because they deserve to be seen!

So, of course I HAD to try 'em for myself as an app. Goodness, boy, do I ever agree. You could just eat the serving which comes with three meatballs and share an entree because these bad boys do their justice as a mini meal. The chef and owners of Trattoria Reggiano are not shy about their food. Oh, plus you are treated to homemade, soft garlic rolls as a starter. Mmmm.\n\nA quaint and intimate restaurant, half the dining area is inside the tiny restaurant and half is out in front, what would typically be equated to the \"sidewalk\". I ate with my family in this latter area which I preferred because the inside seems a little tight. \n\nOk, on to the oh-so-tasty and al dente pasta entrees we all had. My linguini with clams in white sauce was so light and perfectly seasoned, and came with BIG, fresh clams! Family had the linguini carbonara and shrimp scampi. Sauteed in a buttered, olive oil sauce, the shrimp in the scampi was again, not a greedy amount. They were huge and fresh and not overdone.  The applewood smoked bacon pieces in the bolognese sauce for the carbonara really takes this dish to another level.\n\nService got better as the nice progressed but I can say see how others thought there was crankiness goin on. It's a tiny place and 2 waiters are pretty much doing everything. So, for that, couldn't give it a full 5 stars. But, i'd have to say that our waiter did warm up and took good care of us!!

It may be small, and if you choose to sit \"outside\" you may have groups of people walking passed you as they peruse the other stores, but Trattoria Reggiano turns out some really good food.\n\nThe complimentary garlic parmesan bread are big soft pieces of pillows -- be careful, you could get full off these alone -- but even that wouldn't be so bad because they are very good.  Though I only tried two pasta dishes - the carbonara and spaghetti with meatballs - both were delicious and more than enough to where you will surely have leftovers.   The sauce alone in the spaghetti tasted homemade and had so much flavor you would think a sweet Italian grandmother was back there whipping it up -- ya never know -- coulda been.\n\nWe all know that eating out in Vegas can add up, whether you're doing buffets or restaurants, but I'm happy to say that Trattoria Reggiano's prices are so reasonable that you will have plenty of paper leftover for the casinos and cocktails.  And the owner is a very friendly and accommodating man.\n\nDon't sleep on this place, I know I won't, and am looking forward to coming back when I find myself returning to the city of sin."

The wait time and the other reviews made me salivating for a meal at Trattoria Reggiano and I insisted that the rest of my group eat here at least once before we left Vegas the last time I went.\n\nAMBIENCE:\nThe Venetian was my home away from home for the weekend last month when I was in Vegas, so it was in a convenient location.  Walking past the place, it looks like a small, quaint little restaurant, but inviting at the same time with the warm lighting.  There are also tables that sort of stretch out of the restaurant, so people walking by can get a good look of what people are eating and the diners are able to people watch.  It was a little bit awkward waiting for a table because there really isn't any designated \"waiting area\".  Standing too close made me feel like a stalker and standing too far keeping watch on whether my name would be called also made me feel like a stalker.  Recommendation - get there early to avoid the awkward wait.\n\nFOOD QUALITY:\nFirst thing we got on the table was garlic bread.  From my previous posts, you'll know that I love carbs/bread with a passion.  I was sorely disappointed when I took my first bite out of the garlic bread.  I was expecting warm, delicious bread - what I got was cold, oily bread.  Gross.  \nI thought maybe it was just an off day with the bread, but the bad didn't stop there.  If the pasta sauce that I buy at the grocery store tastes better than Trattoria, then you know there is a serious lack of skill in the way they cook pasta here.  This is especially disappointing considering it specializes in pasta and Italian food.  My group and I all ordered pasta and ALL of our pastas were undercooked.  Andrew D. ordered spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs were a little bit cold? - How does that even happen??  All of our dishes were not hot.  All of us didn't want to finish our dishes, but we also didn't want to just throw away $20 per person for our dishes right down the drain.  So, we all just sucked it up and ate our subpar pasta.\n\nSERVICE:\nService was poor.  The hostess seemed a little spacey.  The waiter also took forever getting to our table to take down waters and when he dropped off our food, he was basically MIA for the rest of the time.  I had to wave down the hostess after she was done zoning out to bring us our check since our waiter went MIA on us.\n\nI was not on my Yelp game that day and my group let me have it.  It is safe to say that I will probably not be returning to Trattoria again."

Maybe I was really hungry, maybe I had a bit too much of the Fat Tuesday drink, or maybe, Trattoria Reggiano is just that good.\n\nI visited for dinner on a Sunday night and the place was packed.  There was one free table, 'outside' and we snatched that up.  Our waiter very quickly brought us menus, waters, and took our orders promptly too.  About the food:\n\n-Garlic bread (free): delicious.  If you aren't afraid of carbs, which no one in my family is, these are your best friend.  Warm, soft, and garlicky.  These were so good that we asked for another serving after devouring the first basketful.\n\n-Calamari ($14): a very generous portion.  It was almost too much for the four of us, almost.  There was a nice balance of both the tentacles and the rings/body and the marinara dipping sauce was just right.  \n\n-Baked ziti ($16): cheesy penne pasta; my sister seemed to enjoy this dish quite a bit.\n\n-Spaghetti and meatballs ($18): the spaghetti is good, but what makes this dish great is the meatballs.  They are certified angus beef filet mignon meatballs.  These meatballs are perfectly seasoned, perfectly soft and flavorful.  I would definitely recommend this dish. \n\n-Gnocchi ($18): they were out of pesto so we opted for the alfredo sauce.  The gnocchi was perfectly soft and the alfredo was nice and creamy.  In fact, the sauce was excellent for dipping the garlic bread into.\n\n-Cannoli (free): it was my birthday and the waiter let me pick out a dessert for free!  He brought out four spoons so that we could all share also.  \n\nIf you can't tell already, I really enjoyed my dining experience here.  The service was very friendly and helpful, the food was hot, and tasty, plus- I got a free dessert!  The prices are very fair and the food is high-quality."

This location is more quaint with a mom and pop feel maybe? Half the seating area is also outside where people are wandering through the Venetian.\n\nNothing was terrible, but for the price and 4-star Yelp rating I expected better.\n\nGarlic Bread: I hyped this up a lot in my head, but the bread was, well, bread. Not super garlic-y as I'd hoped, but very soft for sure.\nSpaghetti and Meatballs: the filet mignon meatballs were nothing special. Spaghetti sauce was a little on the sour side. Nothing out of the ordinary.\nLinguine in Clam Sauce: lots of clams, which were delish! Linguine was good, pretty standard.\n\nI most likely will not go back, however the service was excellent!

Make sure to add balsamic vinegar as it did not come with any and their vinegar was divine!!! \n- Hefty prices but at least it came with generous portions of pasta\n- We added chicken to each of our pasta dishes which was an additional $6 and the chicken made the pasta a bit soggy and watered down. It would have been nice if the chicken was sliced into strips instead of coming out as a whole breast\n\nOur lunch was $90 and we didn't even order any alcohol - pretty steep but it IS vegas...\nService was just ok. Started out good as she rushed to take our order but then we had to flag her down for boxes and the check. It definitely hit the spot for our pasta craving but we weren't blown away by the pasta.

After scrolling some reviews, this place sounded good and convenient so we took a seat \"outside.\"\n\nIt took us a while to find it since it's tucked away, but if you find the coffee bean, it's right there.\n\nWait staff was good and I'd give this place 4 stars if you want a quick pre-show bite or you're not worried about the ambiance.  That said, you're butted up against your neighbors and I was having to stare at a $150 gorilla suit and a crazy magician trying to sell a disappearing light that got old after 30 minutes (they have a magic shop next door). NOT A GOOD DATE PLACE, it's a cafe.\n\nThe tables are small and a bit cluttered (I don't need an industrial size of balsamic and olive oil, but I do need a plate to put it in).  The garlic bread knots were good, but as stated below, room temperature which took a bit away from them.  I do not agree with the other reviews as I thought the balsamic vinegar is a bit sweet for my taste.\n\nThe GF got hot tea and it was a packet of the cheapest tea in existence (I don't know that they get many people asking for tea, so wont dwell on that one.\n\nWe started with the warm baby spinach with goat cheese on flat bread, it was ok, I'm not a big fan of flat bread that's soggy in dressing, but the first couple were decent.\n\nWe split the spaghetti with meatballs which equated to a meat ball each with spaghetti.  It wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about either.\n\nIn short, it's a decent quick & easy bite for relatively cheap in the Venitian.  For better Italian, check out Enoteca San Marco or Postrio's pasta dishes in St Mark's square."

The Venetian website listed this as a casual dining place in the one $ price range so it seemed like it'd be the perfect place. \n\nFor two glasses of wine, some meatballs for an app, and two pasta dishes we walked out $90 poorer. When you start approaching the $100 range I'm thinking of a decent place back home on Federal Hill in Providence or the North End in Boston. While Trattoria Reggiano wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't worth it. \n\nIt's a small place with some very crowded tables outside the restaurant. We were quickly seated at one of these and it had all the atmosphere of a mall food court. By the end of the meal I felt as I intimately knew the couple on the side of us because we could easily hear the conversation as well as we could hear our own. Luckily the small children on the other side of us were extremely well behaved because being stuffed so closed to them, it had the potential for disaster. \n\nThe service was ok, but there was a team of four guys working the place and each of the four had a hand in our service. We didn't have one set waiter. One of the guys didn't like to talk and took our order with mumbles and gestures, but the rest of the guys were nice enough. \n\nThe small plate of tortelini I had was decent enough, but nothing to write home about. The gnocci that the girlfriend had was drowning in pesto and wasn't homemade. \n\nWe would've had a cheaper and more enjoyable dinner at Olive Garden. We threw money away like drunken sailors all week and then picked a bad time to try searching out an inexpensive option. We would've been much better off dropping a few extra bucks on a nicer place."

Our waiter was very kind about accommodating our individual requests (\"no ma'am I'm afraid the kitchen does not have any fettucine pasta today, but the tortellini is excellent with the alfredo sauce\" and \"I'm sure we can substitute the puttanesca sauce with your Chicken Parmesan\"), and his helper kept our drinks filled. Everything flowed nicely from start to finish.  The tortellinni alfredo was good as advertised.  They used the large pillow style pasta that I normally associate with ravioli, but they were cooked perfectly.  The sauce relied heavily on butter for it's flavor, but then it's alfredo.  If you want diet food, order sliced fruit. My Chicken Parm had nice flavor and the breading was not as thick and KFC-like as I have had at many spots recently (although sometimes that heavy fried/batter thing can be a guilty pleasure.) They were nice enough to make my side of spaghetti with the puttanesca sauce instead of the normal pomodoro which makes me a fan from jump.  I'm going to give the puttanesca a 7/10 just because I like a little stronger garlic flavor and more fresh basil ribbons, but that is just my quirkiness.  Did I mention the great bread?\n\nThe Bad: Nothing.\n\nThe Mediocre:  Getting to the bathrooms to wash your hands before the meal requires navigating about 4 right turns and not missing the passage off top the side, but then that was my experience of the whole Venetian Grand Canal Shopping area itself. \n\nOverall:  Nice Italian food, in a difficult to find location, but still well worth the effort."

There are so many other, more tasty options at the same price point just steps away. \n\nI got the spaghetti and meatballs as other yelp reviewers raved about it, but it was really just mediocre. The sauce and meatballs were altogether flavorless. The only saving grace of the meal was the garlic knots. \n\nThe atmosphere here is also just mediocre, as it's not in the main atrium area by the canal.

            "review": "After perusing the Yelp reviews of Italian eateries in Las Vegas, the hubby and I decided to give this place a try on a recent trip there.  I'm pretty sure this place makes it money on their wine and alcoholic beverages because I was all geared up for a glass of champagne until I discovered that the only brand of champagne they carry had a price tag of over $100.00 a glass (I believe it was actually $130.00!), and I seem to recall the cheapest glass of wine being somewhere in the vicinity of $13.00!  O.k., so I settled for water and a cappaccino (sp?) as an after-dinner drink!  \n\nWe ordered their \"greens\" salad ($13.00) and it was gigantic, so plenty for the both of us to share.  For our entrees, I had their baked ziti ($18.00) and the hubs ordered his usual favorite, lasagna (same price).  The baked ziti was a very generous serving, but the lasagna looked kind of lonely on the plate, so hubby downed what remained of my entree after devouring his lasagna.  They were both very, very good but I was disappointed in the sauce, which was a light, pale, almost pinkish color.  I was thinking it was maybe either a vodka sauce or pomodoro, but the waiter told us they mix ricotta into their marinara sauce; hence, the paler sauce.  I'm not a huge fan of ricotta outside of it being contained in ravioloi or layering it in lasagna.  I prefer my Italian sauce deep, dark red and rich, so this took away from the dish for me, but that is just my own personal preference.  There were large layers of melted mozzarella covering the baked ziti, which was delish!\n\nNow for the best thing at Trattoria Reggiano - DESSERT!!  And, yes, a \"specific\" dessert at that!  It's spelled C.A.N.N.O.L.I!!!  This was the highlight of our dinner experience at this restaurant!  If you eat here, you simply MUST - and I can't stress this enough - M.U.S.T. indulge in one of their cannoli's!!!  Absolutelyo TO-DIE-FOR - the BEST cannoli to ever make acquaintance with my palate!!  And for a Bostonian gal, this is really saying something as Bostonians take their cannoli's VERY seriously (just ask anyone if you ever happen to be in Boston!).  In the several decades of living on the west coast, I had never yet experienced a cannoli that could compare with the way they're made on the east coast.  But, I'm here to tell you that at Trattoria Reggiano, they are pure HEAVEN!!  No. 1, they are huge.  They are filled with marscapone, as they should be, with a few, very few, chocolate chips scattered throughout, whipped cream on top and a light drizzing of  caramel syrup on the plate to make it look fancy!  I was NOT happy about sharing this with the hubby, especially when he's never really cared for cannoli's before!!  I wanted to be a glutton and eat the entire thing myself, but I decided to be nice!\n\nLastly,their bread is also noteworthy.  They're small roundish little knots of bread with a buttery, garlic topping.  Very yummy!\n\nThe only thing that prevented me from giving this restaurant more stars was the fact that I wasn't crazy about the sauce, but that is just my own personal taste."

I was on a trip and went on a double date after reading the good reviews and choosing it after looking at several Italian restaurants in Vegas. For those who say it is hard to find, we did not have a problem at all. If anyone does, just ask a staff member! I give it 4 stars because we are all recent college grads and it was definitely pricier for us. We knew that walking in, but if you're used to Italian as Buca Di Beppo, Olive Garden, and even Dominos (lol), then you'll want to save this restaurant for your classy dinner. I also could be inaccurate with my rating considering we haven't tried any other \"nicer\" Italian restaurants in Vegas. For our meal, we had the filet migon meatballs as an appetizer, chicken parm, penne bolognese, and tortellini Alfredo. Those garlic knots were also incredibly! Large portion and enjoyed some leftovers. Overall, very satisfied!"

It was my second time dining here, and they impressed me one more time. We ordered pasta al aglio e olio, linguine with clams (with white sauce) and the oven grilled bruschetta pizza. There was nothing special from the appetizers or the salad section so we did not order anything, but their garlic knots were more than enough for us to start the dinner. I personally loved their bread. It was tasty with just enough oil as well. The flavor went very well with the balsamic and olive oil. \n\nFood was served very promptly as it should be for pastas. The presentation did have anything special but the food smelled delicious. I didnt add shrimp to my aglio e olio this time because my sister is allergic to shrimp, but you can also add some for 6 dollars, and their shrimps are always cooked very nicely. We wanted gnocci but they were out of pesto sauce, so we didnt, but I would definitely try it next time. Linguine was tasty as well, the clams were cooked right and there was enough juice on the dish that the linguine was moist until we were done eating. The bruschetta pizza was recommended by our server, it was one of the greatest oven grilled pizzas I have had so far. The fresh mozzarella went well with it. I usually am not a big fan of onions, but even the onions tasted so yummy. \n\nService tonight was great as well. The staff fulfilled our needs promptly and friendly. We had a great dinner here. I am going to try their new location in Summerlin next time and try their gnocci."

He had our waters out to us and our bread to us quite fast, but it was okay with me because I was thirsty. I read some of the other yelp reviews, and decided that I wanted to get the calamari. Calamari is probably one of my favorite appetizers. It was a huge portion. The calamari was so crispy and it was just delicious. It wasn't too salty and it had a tomato based dipping sauce which complimented the calamari perfectly. The added lemon juice made it extra delicious for me. This calamari dish was one of the best I've had. My boyfriend and I devoured that, hehe. The bread was wonderful too. \n\nFor our main dishes he had the chicken parmigiana with the spaghetti. It was a good sized portion, if I would've known better I would have just shared with him! You could really taste the tomatoes in the sauce. I had a lemon dish with chicken, I forget the name. Sorry! I won't lie though it was a little too lemony for me, and I am a big lemon fan. So rethink that dish if you don't want to be overwhelmed by lemon. \n\nBut I do love this Italian restaurant.

I don't like that hotel and I don't like malls. However I will endure a lot for good food. As predicted walking through the Grand Canal Shops in search of Trattoria Reggiano was beyond unpleasant.

Either that or they had a legit Italian faccent (fake accent), which was so good that it may be real. \n\nFood here was a bit pricier than I expected (but was it really? It's dining on the strip...), but was good. They start you off with these garlic bread rolls. Make sure you're limiting how many of these you eat. They will come to suffocate you later when you try to fit more carb into your body. The pastas here come in pretty large sizes and are so tasty you just want to keep eating them. Don't. Trust me when i say to box about half of your pasta. I did just that and I was full after a while, and my family finished theirs and I almost had to roll them to the car because they were so full. It may not have helped that we finished with the tiramisu, which was a custard mixed with ladyfingers served in a wine glass. Everything we had here was delicious. I had the carbonara, my mom had a seafood fettuccine, and my brother had the bolognese. All were really tasty and plentiful.  \n\nOne of the things I would change about this place is pricing (but I know it's hard to complain about pricing on the strip). Each pasta plate cost around $17-20+. The other thing I would point out is being able to hear the staff get yelled at/scolded since we were seated near the kitchen. It's almost shameful to the staff to face the customers after they just got scolded!\n\nOtherwise, food was great here and service followed through. Give this place a try if you're in the area!"

Lobster ravioli too was full of flavor, came out pleasantly warm and both dishes were good portion sizes. As were the filet mignon meatballs, which make quite the appetizer (if you are considering ordering them, just do it). Wine prices by the glass and bottle were typical. Garlic knots were a little too reminiscent of a local pizza parlor's, but I'll take it. A little dressing of balsamic vinegar and Olive oil will do the trick. \n2) Secondly, service was a B. Our server was very friendly, but simply put, we just didn't see enough of him. Of course we want to enjoy our meal privately, but more intimate interaction would have warranted two thumbs up instead of one.\n3) Atmosphere was a B-. If you're sitting inside I imagine it's a little more cozy than the outside tables that are uncomfortably close to the passing Venetian guests walking by eyeballing your entrees. I hope your dining guest is easy on the eyes, for he/she will really be all there is to look at during your meal."

            "review": "I have mixed feelings about this Trat. \n\nVisiting Las Vegas last week, we wanted an intimate dinner before seeing The Phantom at the Venetian, and the Trattoria Reggiano is only a moment's walk from the theater. In light of the other reviews here, it seemed an inspired choice. It was less than that. \n\nOn arrival, on a not-terribly-busy Thursday evening after the theater - about 9 PM - it looked terribly inviting: Tables in the walkway as if a true Italian trat, and a few booths and tables inside near the open kitchen. Charming. We asked the Maitre' d for a booth (it helps my hearing, which is very poor), and were told we would not have it, and were shown to a table inside by the wall. OK, but a disappointment, even though it saved me $10 top to the Maitre' d, who seemed oblivious.  \n\nDelicious bread, with decent oil and vinegar, rapidly arrived, as did our waiter, who I asked for a recommendation between the spaghetti with meatballs (\"filet mignon\") and the linquine bolognese. \"Eh!\" He said. \"It's the same sauce, just not in a meatball.\"  Ummmm. The staff says the food is the same?  Disquieting. \n\nMy pasta and my wife's Ziti arrived almost immediately, as we were still on our first piece of bread. Good service is not the same as fast service; this isn't Pasta Now, but a relaxing meal. Still, it was hot and freshly prepared. The Bolognese was tasty, and (as usual) I ate half, expecting to take it back to our room for lunch the next day. My wife, who eats like a bird, ate about a quarter of her Ziti, and as the second waiter came to remove our dishes, I said, \"It was delicious, but we want to take it with us.\" He nodded and left.\n\n A few moments later, our waiter returned with a check - strangely, for an Italian restaurant, without asking if we wanted dessert - and I asked, \"Where is our food.\" I got blank looks; the second waiter said, \"Thrown out.\"  Argument follows. Finally, the headwaiter said, \"Wait. We'll recook for you.\" This time, it takes longer, but when the bag returns, there are two tins inside; I look in the top one, and find bread. \"Where is my linguine?\" I ask. Blank looks all over again. More argument. Finally, another recook, we take the food, and leave. \n\nThe service is obviously challenging, perhaps due in part to there being several languages and accents going on among the staff. The food was good, but not great; the meat sauce lacked seasoning (garlic is not all there is in this world). The Ziti was nice, but as it sat on the table, the cheese started changing from gentle yellow to bright orange. \"Cheese powder, perhaps?\" said my wife. But it was good, albeit a bit incandescent in appearance.  The ambiance was very good, with a slight hint of New York Italian as a result of the dark stained booths. \n\nOverall, better than the food court next door, but not the place for the intimate and relaxing after-theater supper that many might wish."

Despite this, the host/manager said to come back at 7.  We arrived at 7 and he said it'd be a few extra minutes.  There was an empty table for 4 being cleared and I knew we were next on the list, but he sat a party of 4 there before us, leaving us waiting for a party of 2 to get up.  I realize that they don't have many tables and it would seem like a waste to sit a party of 2 at a 4-top, but it was poor service since they rushed a party of 2 out after that, though we still waited another 10 minutes for them.\n\nThe server wasn't nearly as friendly as last time.  He was a little rude when I asked for bread and said, \"Lady, this a busy store!\" in his Italian accent.  I realized it was busy, but we'd been sitting there over 5 minutes before he even came over and then he didn't bring bread the first 2 times he stopped by.  And I was damn hungry.  We both lightened up and he got a nicer toward the end of the meal (probably to bring up his tip).\n\nFood was still excellent.  Got the penne primavera with grilled chicken.  I wish I got something with red sauce, though, because it looked so good, but I remembered how good the primavera was.  Big portions and despite my hunger, I couldn't finish it all.  Pinot Grigio wasn't as good as I recall, but maybe I've just had better since then.\n\nOverall, I'd still recommend for a cheaper, solid meal in Vegas."

He was very pleasant and knowledgeable. With his help we chose the perfect amount of food.  He brought us the most deliciously warm seasoned rolls that we had to have a second serving. We ordered calamari, ceasar salad, chicken parmigian, shrimp with linguini in a marinara sauce.  My family loved all of it! We're from NYC where there is no shortage of good Italian restaurants so we have a pretty good idea about what good Italian food should taste like.  Did I mention the rolls???? We ordered pretty standard stuff and they executed these dishes to perfection.  Victor took care of us by being very attentive and predicting our every need. My only regret was not having enough room for dessert. For 5 of us the bill was $90 including tip, a steal! Remember this is the venetian palazzo complex where restaurants can make your wallet cry all the way to the bank.  When I go back to Las Vegas, I'm definitely going back for round 2, this time with a little extra hunger to squeeze in dessert."

With a very good imagination you could envision yourself at a small bistro in the middle of a village in Italy. The servings at this restaurant are very large so it would be most ideal to share a meal with a friend rather than feel like you need to be wheeled back to your hotel.\n\nThe garlic knots/muffins are so darn good I could probably be happy just eating a Caesar salad and this garlicky piece of heaven. But noooo.....eggplant parmigiana was calling my name and it did not disappoint. My friends ordered veal scalloppini piccata and an eggplant ricotta pizza and were all pleased with their orders.

I found a killer vacation deal over the Xmas holiday and thought why not do something different this year. Anyways,  I found this restaurant on Yelp (like most restaurants I visit while out of town). It had great reviews and I was also very excited to try the buttery buns Yelpers raved about.\n\nMy experience here was terrible. I have never felt so unwelcomed and ridiculed. The buttery buns arrived at our table with a bottle of balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I asked our middle aged Italian server if I could have another plate to pour the EVOO and vinegar in. He flat out told me \"this is not how we eat our bread. Use the same plate you have\". I was completely floored and just looked at him. I guess he realized that wasn't a good answer. He then grabbed a side plate from the empty table near me and pretty much threw it on the table. The underlying tone of his comment was condescending and made me feel like the way I like to eat my bread was completely irrational. I should have asked him who this \"we\" is. I didn't know a oil and vinegar police existed.\n\nOur server then ignored us while being attentative to all neighboring patrons. I was quite peeved and blurted out loudly- \"the service here is TERRRIBLE\" so that all my neighboring patrons could hear me and also conveniently while he was serving them. This quickly changed how he treated us. He quickly came over and asked me how the pizza was. I said \"it's OK\", then he has the audacity to say \"it's ONLY OK?\". There was no underlying joke behind his comment. I just ignored his comment and he left. \n\nWe quickly finished our meal and asked our busser to send the bill. I paid, leaving a 5% tip (the bussers shouldn't be punished, even though they only get a small cut of the tip). \n\nOn my way out I flagged down the manager, a middle aged Italian woman, and told her the situation. The first thing she says is \"what do you want from this?\", as thought she thought I was expecting a comped meal. I said \"nothing, I already paid and am not happy with the service\". She then defended our server saying that he is very good and that I misinterpreted him and that he was probably joking. I was thinking in my head what a joke THIS IS. No wonder service is so bad when management can't set an example of basic customer service and makes the customer feel stupid. I told the manager we are leaving since this was hopeless. The manager then clues in and says \"let's discuss this with the server and have him apologize to you.\" I declined and she told me to come back tomorrow and she will make sure we \"get served right\". No thank you and we walked away. \n\nDo yourself a favor and don't eat here.  There are plenty of other delicious Italian choices on the strip which provide excellent or even decent service and good food."

This caused a bit of a problem because while there was a small line (maybe 10 people waiting), I did not want to take up an empty table of 4 or 6 if there were other parties behind me that would fit the table better. So I suggested to the hostess to seat the parties behind me until a smaller table opened up for me. She felt so bad that she immediately brought me a complementary glass of wine! After about 10 minutes of sipping my wine at a coffee shop across the way, she excitedly waved for me to come over. Upon seating me, she immediately poured me another glass of wine and thanked me for being so nice. THIS is the way a restaurant should treat its customers! In fact, while eating my dinner, I noticed how friendly the staff was to each other. What a great group of servers!\n\nNow onto the food... Having been raised by an Italian mother in New York, I was cautiously optimistic about all the rave reviews. I ordered the linguine with shrimp marinara, which not only arrived piping hot...but with perfectly cooked pasta and about 20 LARGE shrimp. Now, this is how I'd normally make it for my family at home...but for a restaurant, this was outstanding! What really made the dish was the scrumptious was the pasta sauce with its chunks of garlic and fresh cut basil. Watching other dished being served, all I could think of was how fresh everything was. Sooo good! The garlic rolls that were served were the perfect accompaniment.\n\nI was so pleased with my meal ($24) and the friendly service that I made sure to tip the waiter well and I even sneaked the hostess $10 on the way out. I felt it was the least I could do for the two free glasses of wine she served me!\n\nWhat a delight this restaurant was. Small, cozy, romantic and very friendly. It reminded me of many of the small restaurants I used to visit with my family in NYC's Little Italy as a kid. It's a MUST if you are looking for good, basic Italian food in Vegas!"

Even an attempt to make the dish tolerable by adding spices did not work at all. It was beyond disappointing. \n\nThe other 3 dishes were just as dry. One of the girls ordered Alfredo sauce as a replacement to the original and let's just say, they all looked the same.\n\nNone of us finished.\n\nOur conversations at the table consisted on how much better we could have made pasta, and how awful our waiter was.

We were craving some \"good\" Italian food so decided to try Trattoria Reggiano based on other Yelp reviews. I must say they more than exceeded my expectations! Every single server who we came in contact with had a smile on their face & a pleasant voice. I asked one of the servers of he could recommend one of their red wines by the glass. He said he could & would be right back. He returned with 3 wine bottles, gave me tastes of each,  & allowed me to choose which one I preferred. I greatly appreciated this! I then asked about bread & he came back with the most amazing garlic knots! Oh wow! Lastly our meals were delicious. My cousin had the chicken marsala, which she said was wonderful & I had the cappollini pomodoro. The tomato sauce was full of flavor, not just tomato. Everything about our meal was completely satisfying. I cannot wait to go to their restaurant in Downtown Summerlin now!!! YUM!!!"

I was coming off a cold and wanted nothing more than the homecooked feel of spaghetti and meatballs, which I had with the house chianti and the famous house garlic knots. \n\nBest spaghetti and meatballs ever. The sauce was impeccable, balanced but distinct flavor, and light enough not to stop your stomach a few bites in. Pasta was just as perfect - you know you've had a good meal when you remember how much you enjoyed the experience of simply eating it. I'm not usually capable of putting a lot away, but I finished the entire plate, and got a congratulatory, \"Good job, boss\" from my cameriere. Much better than the chiding he gave the Italian sitting next to me, who was apparently letting his pizza get too cold while texting.\n\nThe bill was on my table in a flash, the real boss told a waiting guest \"This table will be ready in 30 seconds,\" and I was on my way. Grazie!"

As when you're walking through the Venetian feeling like you're \"outdoors\", strolling Venice, Trattoria Reggiano exuded a relaxing respite from shopping and the many, many frou-frou Vegas restaurant options. The smell of the fresh-baked garlic rolls becomes more pungent as you get closer and the warm, welcoming personalities of the staff definitely made us feel as if we were walking into our neighborhood Italian restaurant. Everything felt very authentic from the quality of the olive oil, the fresh-grated parmesan cheese, and the colorful options of Italian soda and (iced) teas. \n\nFood standouts (SOOOO good my friend and I ate there two days out of our 3 day Vegas trip): \n\n- Garlic rolls: Ridiculously delicious. Served piping hot. \n\n- Spaghetti Aglio e Olio: generous portion of pasta cooked perfectly al dente with olive oil, crushed red pepper, parsley, and fresh grated parmesan cheese. A simple but traditional dish so you know the flavor was REALLY good. \n\n- Penne in Vodka Sauce: another generous portion of pasta cooked perfectly al dente with shallots, vodka, proscuitto in creamy pink sauce. My friend is super-model skinny and she ate the entire dish - it was THAT good. \n\n- Cannoli. Holy eff. This is the best cannoli I've ever tasted. The marscarpone cream was light and fluffy, the shell was crunchy, and there were just enough chocolate chips for sweetness. \n\nConsidering all of the trips I've taken to Vegas, Trattoria Reggiano is definitely a standout. I can't wait to visit again. Delizioso!"

The main course, the fettuccini Alfredo was simply the best I have ever had, and that includes comparing this dish to restaurants from all around the world. The combination of ingredients and the preparation demonstrate an exceptionally skilled chef. Likewise, the Tiramisu is not to be missed, complemented by superbly prepared cappuccino.

It was rather bland and the sauce was not sticking to the pasta.  I also tried a bite of the bolognese and was not wowed by it either.  The pasta didn't really seem to absorb any flavor.  I was pretty sad because I wanted to try this place and dragged my friends there.  Most of them seemed \"meh\" about the food.\n\nOn the other hand, I tried my friend's lobster ravioli, and I really enjoyed it.  There were chunks of lobster inside, and the creamy sauce coated the ravioli well.  I would recommend this dish.\n\nThis restaurant is located near the shops.  You can also get there walking through the food court that's next to the parking structure (it is behind the Coffee Bean at the shops, not by the escalators).

            "review": "If you've never been here before, be prepared to take an extra 15 minutes to find this place because of how huge the Venetian is. This restaurant is in an indoor mall within the Venetian. Though it's indoors with a controlled climate, most of the seating is still \"outside\" of the restaurant on the patio, so you might have a bunch of random people and kids and strollers walk right past your table. If you don't mind that, the food is great and the staff is kind and attentive.\n\nI went with my friend and her mom, dad, brother, sister, sister's husband and their baby girl. The menu is big but not too large, but big enough to make it hard to decide because at least two things sound awfully good. I teetered between gnocchi in pesto cream sauce and lobster ravioli. I absolutely love ravioli and thick, chewy pastas. I went with the lobster ravioli. The texture of the ravioli pasta was just right, and the filling was a mixture of cheese and lobster. I forget what was in the pink sauce, it was tomato and a bit creamy or buttery and I think they put some shrimp on it as well. My friend enjoyed her very cheesy rigatoni, her sister's gnocchi in pesto looked amazing and I wished I had ordered it, her husband got the same thing I did and ate it all up, her mother I think got the eggplant parmesan but don't quote me on that... I believe it was gooey and flavorful and cooked to her liking. My friend's brother ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and of course that was done very well with al dente pasta and a good sauce. The meatballs are very large and a bit more delicate than they seem from looking at them. I accidentally dropped half a meatball someone had ordered on the side into my water glass due to underestimating the strength of the meatball in relation to my fork. The waiter smiled and just brought out another big meatball in sauce free of charge. I believe everyone was satisfied with their meal. I I didn't end up finishing my ravioli however, but it's my fault because I ordered something too fishy for my tastes. On occasion a bite of the lobster ravioli was too strong and lobstery for me. Don't ask me why, I'm picky and mild with my seafood flavors. The shrimp were fine. Ultimately I had hoped they had my favorite on the menu, mushroom ravioli. I order those everywhere I see them, they always have such a rich nutty taste and they mix so well with cheese and make a great filling! I think that's the reason I ordered the lobster ravioli... I really craved mushroom ravioli. Anyway, I think I should have gotten the pesto gnocchi, that looked INCREDIBLE! I bet it was. If I ever go back I'll try that."

Trattoria Reggiano is located on the second floor right next to the escalators near the floors 1-16 in the Venetian.  It's a small restaurant with few seating.  In fact there are more tables outside then inside.  When I say outside it's actually indoors where people walk by.  Their menu consists of salads, pastas, and pizzas.  They bring out complimentary bread to your table.  These small bread pieces are covered in butter, seasoning, and parmesan cheese.  I ordered the bruschetta pizza and it didn't disappointed.  It was freaking delicious! The bottom of the pizza was crispy but not burnt.  The toppings include tomato sauce, shredded mozzarella, fresh cubes of mozzarella, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and basil.  All of the ingredients were fresh.  The service was great because they checked on us often and got us refills on bread and drinks.  I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.  Can't wait to go back and try other pizzas."

We wanted to sit inside because it looked cozier than the tables in the middle of the walkway, but we were told actually they were starting to clean up in there so we would have to sit outside. No problem!\n\nHowever, we felt immediately like the few waitstaff were visibly upset we had been seated, particularly our waiter. He looked tired, and annoyed he had a table. So much so we literally asked him 3-4 times if it was really OK that we were sitting down to eat. He assured us it was OK if we put the order in quickly. \n\nOverall, they pushed the food out quickly, and we all enjoyed our pizza/pasta. For the price, this place is quite the deal on the strip. You get a lot, it's in a nice indoor location, and the food was very good. If this was a normal restaurant I would give it 3 stars (entirely because of the feeling like we were a burden, the food was great), but the value vs others around make it a 4 for me."

I'm not sure but it was really loud) really threw it off. \n\nI started with a glass of wine - they don't tell you what brand the wines by the glass are, but the cabernet sauvignon I ordered tasted an awful lot like two-buck chuck. \n\nThe garlic knots were good. We ordered the filet mignon meatballs to start, but they really weren't anything special. There was nothing interesting about their texture or the way they tasted. The sauce was flat in taste and more watery / homogenous than I would have liked. I ordered the linguine carbonara, which was fine, but was a little soggier / less al dente than I would have liked. My date had the chicken parmegiana, which was also a bit on the \"soggy\" side. \n\nVegas is sorely lacking in pasta places and this satisfied my craving for pasta (brought on by Olive Garden commercials on repeat on Hulu.. and I flat out refuse to go to Olive Garden)... but it won't be somewhere I make a special trip for."

After looking up some places, he chose this one, and I am extremely thankful that he did.\n\nLooking at the menu, I immediately freaked out because of the pricing (double what I usually pay for). However, I decided to roll with it, as we don't splurge that often, and it was Vegas, after all.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nStarters: Filet Mignon Meatballs ($12): These were absolutely amazing! It comes with three plump meatballs, much bigger than we were expecting, with a delicious tomato-y pomodoro sauce and some spaghetti. We wished we ordered it from the Pasta menu, but maybe next time?\n\nPasta Specialties: Gnocchi al Pesto ($18): Soft ricotta dumplings with a creamy pesto sauce in a large plate that I simply could not finish! These are a meal on their own, and in my case I had leftovers. These cheesy dumplings should not be underestimated, as they do fill you up!\n\nIndividual Brick Oven Pizza: Primavera ($16): A light vegetarian pizza loaded with flavors. I have had a pizza with similar toppings, and that pizza absolutely pales in comparison. This pizza was not very greasy and seemed to be quite authentic.\n\nDrinks: Cappuccino ($6.5): The most expensive cappuccino I have ever had, but one that I will never regret ordering. After having that cappuccino, I have craved it many times over. The drink comes in a small cup with a small piece of biscotti on the side and a small stick of rock sugar. It was the perfect cup of cappuccino in my opinion.\n\nMy family (4 including me) shared these dishes and we had leftover pizza and gnocchi, which we (I) later on devoured at our hotel room. The service was great, with our server giving us time to eat and periodically refilling our water glasses. I was surprised that he didn't come by to check on our food as often as people usually do, but it was a nice change, and I'm guessing more authentically Italian? Anyways, I highly recommend this place!"

We stumbled across it on our way to find the passage to the Palazzo, in which we were staying, but I don't think that we would have discovered it otherwise. There is a limited amount of \"indoor\" and \"outdoor\" seating available, in quotations because the entire thing---which is basically doused with that charming mom-and-pop vibe---is inside a hotel, all decorated with a retro-Italian theme.\n\nI ordered the Penne Primavera, a veggie-full dish with no sauce but just a dash of garlic for taste. It came fairly quickly, which was a relief because we were so hungry, but they also give you unlimited baskets of bread to eat with olive oil and vinegar. The Penne ended up being the slighlty-bland you would expect from something so healthy, but as I am trying to eat clean I decided it was a good choice and jealously eyed my friends' spaghetti and meatballs and Linguini Bolognese. I only had a taste of each, but I can attest that Trattoria sauce is exceptional. The meat is tender and perfectly complements the pasta.\n\nThere are no refills on drinks, however, because they come in bottles. (Water, of course, has refills)."

We had 6 and it took us about 45 min - 1 hr. Wait was totally worth it for the following reasons:\n\n1) They serve hot fresh bread, garlic olive oil bread with option of dipping in balsamic  vinegar and olive oil\n\n2) The portions are filling and very affordable for Las Vegas prices - $16 - $30ish for entrees (I recommend the pasta)\n\n3) Service is attentive and they speak Italian (great sign for an Italian restaurant)\n\nI personally had the Linguine with Shrimp Marinara and it was the highlight meal of the trip.

Great food, good prices and kid friendly...what could be better. I highly suggest restaurant and can wait to visit when I am in Vegas again."

We were not disappointed! It is kind of hidden away from other restaurants, has limited seating but we had no problem getting a table immediately. The garlic rolls were so fresh and garlic-y! Husband ordered a delicious red wine - dont recall the exact name but it was a $38 Primativo. Our entrees came out very quickly and piping hot. Husband had gnocchi with pesto sauce and I the linguini carbonara. Pesto sauce w as extremely fresh and vibrantly green. The gnocchi was the perfect texture, not gummy or pastey. The carbonara was so creamy yet light. Even though we ate all of our entrees and were extremely full, we decided to share the tiramasu. We managed to polish it off quickly! Highly recommend! We will definitely make this a regular stop on all of our future trips."

It worked out nice because we were the only ones inside and it felt like we had the place to ourselves :) I ordred the carbonara and the Hubby ordered the alfredo.  Our meals came out fast.  They loaded my pasta up with bacon, it was yummy.  The sauce very thick and creamy, different that what I am use to, but it was good.  The Hubby LOVED his alfredo.  I didn't love the garlic knots, but dipped in some balsamic it was good.  They seemed to be over steamed so they got hard and dry.  Overall, we were happy."

We started with the Filet Mignon meatballs which were tasty and saucy.  As for the garlic rolls, I found those to be too doughy.  For dinner  my adult children had caesar salads, pizza and pesto gnocci, which they enjoyed.  I ordered the baked ziti which was delicious.  For dessert, we enjoyed the very dense chocolate layer cake, which the three of us were unable to finish.  This place made me wish we had a refrigerator waiting in our room so we could bring home our leftovers.  One of my favorite things about this place is the authenticity of the wait staff.  I enjoyed the energy in the place, including the yelling at each other in Italian, interacting with the patrons with personality and genuine interest, and the attention to the patrons' comfort.  You can tell this is a family owned restaurant and that they take pride in their establishment."

After a little online research, I stumbled upon Trattoria Reggiano.  The reviews looked good, and the price was right, so I decided to check it out--I'm so glad I did! \n\nI was first taken aback by how tiny the restaurant is. Seriously, you could legitimately call it a \"hole in the wall\" because it's just that small-there are only seven tables inside and a handful of tables outside in mall walkway. As it turns out, sometimes the best things come in small packages!  \n\nWhen I walked in, I was immediately seated and served some fantastic bread! I placed my order and started a glass of wine. Before I could even finish my first piece of bread, my spaghetti and meatballs were already brought to the table! The service in this place was great!\n\nMy food was fantastic (apparently, previous posters weren't joking about the filet mignon meatballs)!  My check was a total of $27--not too bad at all, especially in comparison to the other Italian spots that are found all over the area.\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience. Also, this place is legit--the servers were all speaking to each other in Italian--I loved it! I definitely recommed paying Trattoria Reggiano a visit!"

We (a table of 6) were seated right away and garlic knots were at our fingertips before we could blink. Our waiter was lovely and our dishes came quickly and everyone was overwhelmed by how delicious it was. \n\nWe tend to stick to cheaper places but everyone agreed the price was well worth how delicious the food was.

While the food here was decent, there are better options very close by.\n\nOrdered the calamari and linguine with clams to keep it simple. The calamari was fine, not overcooked. The linguine was fine too, nothing to rave about. As is typical with most American-style Italian places masquerading as Italian, there was an excess of oil, the pasta was boxed, and the sauce was probably from canned ingredients.\n\nFor the price, I'd expect more than that, considering the atmosphere is not great. The restaurant itself is really small, but more importantly it's smack in the middle of a bunch of random shops, so you get that mall feeling, and even though it wasn't very busy, the service was inattentive."

Not a bad idea since the restaurant is on the small side and they do not appear to take reservations.  \n\nAfter reading all the rave reviews about the meatballs, well of course I had to get them as an appy!  The server was kind enough to offer the option of cutting down the standard order down to only one or two meatballs from the usual three, so that I can enjoy the entree that I really wanted without killing myself ; ). \n\nPeople weren't kidding about the meatballs -- they were great for sure, but in my opinion,Trattoria Reggiano truly shines with their killer bolognese, bar-none.  \n\nFor the main, I decided on their daily special, which happened to be mushroom ravioli bolognese.  Boy was I ever in for a spectacular treat!!!  It will definitely be difficult to go back to the usual pink slime bolognese that the average restaurant serves, where the ground \"meat\" simply melts into the sauce for the most part.\n\nNot only were the al dente ravioli large enough to be nicely stuffed with that aromatic mushroom/ricotta/goat cheese mixture, the generously portioned pillows of pasta were heavily blanketed by the other star of the dish: an uber thick and hearty meat sauce made with nothing other than abundant chunks of  high quality ground filet mignon.    Each bite was full of lean, solid meat and juicy tomato chunks.   Insane depth of flavours and textures....best pasta I've had to date, short of traveling to Italy.  \n\nThe bill came to $34 but there was enough left over to cover dinner.  There was no microwave in the hotel room to heat it up but that did not diminish the food's taste by much. Still thoroughly enjoyed it unheated as much as I did at the restaurant.   \n\nTwo meals of this heavenly goodness.......  OMG what a dream food day!!! =)"

About three years ago we celebrated my sister's birthday here and we loved it so much we celebrated my mother's birthday here this time. Three years and it is STILL consistently great!\n\nI made a reservation on Open Table for a Monday at 5:30pm. We arrived on time and our table was ready. There were other guests, but it wasn't too busy - understandable given it was early and a Monday.  The atmosphere is kinda casual dressy - there are white tablecloths and cloth napkins, but it is brightly lit and open. There were children dining as well so it is kid friendly. I think they'll even give the kids crayons. \n\nThe waiter was VERY friendly and funny! Made casual jokes but wasn't inappropriate or anything like that. He promptly brought us water and their delicious buttery/oily/garlicky rolls! They're so soft and fluffy! There's olive oil and balsamic for dipping as well. Mmm the perfect way to start a meal. Our food came out pretty quickly too. It's an open kitchen so you can see them preparing everything fresh!\n\nChicken Cesar salad ($16): a little pricy for a salad, but I had it as my entree so not too bad on Vegas price standards. They give you a big plate of romaine perfectly coated in creamy dressing. It's topped with shaved Parmesan and grilled chicken that was marinated in balsamic. So good and a good amount to share. \n\nCalamari appetizer ($14): perfect size for the 6 of us to share. Each piece fried crispy and there was a good ratio of rings to tentacles. Served with yummy marinara sauce and lemon. \n\nFilet mignon meatballs ($16): my sister and her husband shared this appetizer, but let us all try it. The most tender meatballs you will ever have! Mmm the tomato sauce is perfect with it to. Topped with Parmesan and comes with three to an order. \n\nPenne in vodka sauce ($18): perfectly cooked penne in a creamy tomato sauce cooked with onions and topped with prosciutto. My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nChicken Marsala ($22): my mother's boyfriend ordered this and said it was the BEST chicken Marsala he's ever had! I tried it and it WAS good, considering it's something I would probably never order. The chicken was tender and the sauce was well balanced. \n\nSpaghetti bolognese ($18): my sister and her husband shared this and said it was very tasty - they ate the entire plate. \n\nSince we were celebrating my mother's birthday they gave us a tiramisu on the house! So sweet of them. It was served in a glass cup with two lady fingers sticking out of it. The cup was held to the plate with caramel which was tasty and cool to look at. \n\nOnce again this restaurant did not disappoint and I would return and recommend! I'm sure everything on the menu is delicious, but then I always want to eat my favorites because they're that good! If you're in Vegas and want good Italian food that will not break your bank - go here!"

He refused to make eye contact with me.\nHe did not clear our tables nor ask if we wished to have desert. I was in tears, utterly confused, angry and very upset.\nWe will never return to this restaurant."

When I asked how large the pizza was he seemed insulted like, \"what a stupid question, they are10 inches, not enough for two people\" he said. Wrong it turned out the pizza is more like 14 inches plenty enough for a late snack for two. This waiter who could have been the owner or manager was unfriendly.rushed, and worse, uncaring. He could care less if we enjoyed ourselves or not. My bill was $38.50 for one dull over cooked pizza and 2 drinks. $8 for a beer $11 for a glass of wine. When he returned my change he couldn't be bothered with returning my 1.50 so he just skipped the .50 change and left a dollar bill. Remember we hadn't said as much as a word or 2 to this guy and somehow he just didn't like us. My suggestion take your Vegas dollars elsewhere!"

I normally drink only half a glass at most at any given restaurant, but I drank 3 glasses here! I wasn't even that thirsty!\n\nWe tried the filet mignon meatballs people keep talking about; they were above average but we did not experience the whoa factor. Chicken marsala was also above average and was the best tasting one I've ever had at a restaurant but it wasn't as good as the one my cousin makes. He notes, however, that the sauce was really well made.\n\nThe free bread was also pro, predipped in oil and very tasty. The olive oil and vinegar were also very nice.\n\nP.S.

But if you are just looking for a good Italian food reasonably priced, then this place is for you.  \n\nMy husband loved his lobster ravioli and I liked my dish too.  The dessert was too sweet for my taste but I bet a lot of people like it.  Two pasta dishes and a dessert = $55 plus tip.

The offered fresh garlic bread, which was delicious! We ordered the calamari which was really good yet bad for you because it was fried. The texture of the calamari was soft, well seasoned and hot. The shrimp scampi portion was huge. Depending how you like your pasta some like it with some flavor but I like my pasta with flavor. I guess the only good part of this is that they didn't use that much butter! :) The shrimp however was perfect not over cooked, nicely stuffed and well seasoned. We also had the Salsiccia pizza which was delicious. It's a pretty small restaurant that serves pretty good food. But when the employees speak Italian you kind of know the food is legit."

This place is hidden away close to the Food Court area and behind a few of the shops on Canal street. There is a outside sitting area where you can watch people walking by and some booths inside. \n\nThe GF and I were craving some pizza and the pies looked good (yes I was looking at peoples food while walking by :-p). So we decided to stop in for lunch, it was quiet as it was a Tuesday afternoon. We sat in a cozy booth and it was quite comfortable. They brought us some garlic rolls with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The rolls were just ok, but they were free so no complaints from me. We shared the Pepperoni and olive pizza. It was quite a tasty pizza, the sauce was really good, and tasted great with the peperoni's. I was quite impressed with how good the crust was, thin and crunchy, not too doughy. It was the perfect size pizza for the two of us and I was not overly stuffed when we left. While we were eating an Italian tourist came in speaking Italian to the wait staff, for a second we felt as we were in Italy. Our waitress was great, attentive and provided to the atmosphere. \n\nOverall a good experience, would I eat here again if i was in Vegas? Probably not but that is not because of the food or service but simply because there are too many place to try in Vegas. Why eat at the nearby food court when this is right next to it? If you're looking for an relatively inexpensive, tasty meal, I would definitely recommend Trattoria's."

I ordered the carbonara and my sister ordered the eggplant parmesan. The carbonara was delicious! It really hit the spot because I was craving something richer so I'd be satiated for the late night we were about to have. The prosciutto was crispy and the noodles were perfectly al dente. The portion was just enough to not have leftovers or feel too full. Oh, and as you've probably read in majority of reviews, their complimentary garlic knots were awesome! You can't have Italian food without garlic bread and these were the best I've had anywhere, they're packed with flavor! The price point was decent considering it was in The Venetian.

(Great Idea) We decided we were staying in and having drinks, playing cards and enjoying each others company. We decided pizza would be a great idea and boy was it. Not only were they quick, but the delivery person was nice and polite. The Pizza was great, wings were crispy and delicious. We have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place, as far as pizza goes. Lol. Definitely a place to order pizza."

We stumbled upon this place just walking around the Grand Canal Shoppes and decided to give it a try based on seating availability. Who knew it had such good reviews on Yelp! It's located right before the food court and has a nice patio seating area. \n\nThe food came out pretty quickly. Before your entree comes, they give you complimentary garlic knots and they are to DIE for. It comes out super hot, soft and delicious!! Dip it in some balsamic vinegar and oil and I could eat it for days. It's definitely comparable to the garlic knots at C&O's in Los Angeles if you've ever been there. I was thinking of ordering the lasagna but our waiter said they were out of lasagna for the day. HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF LASAGNA AT AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT? Sure, it's one of your more popular items, so shouldn't you have a lot of ingredients for your popular dishes? To say the least, I was severely disappointed. I settled for the penne a la Vodka which is topped with diced prosciutto. The creamy pink sauce has a nice, delicate taste to it. I wish there was just more sauce though. The penne was cooked al dente and had a firm texture to it. I'd definitely recommend and you can't go wrong with a penne dish! \n\nMy heart was set on ordering the lasagna... maybe I'll get it next time if they don't run out... so disappointing."

In particular, we have ordered the Chicken Parmigiana and Chicken Francese on many occasions. The quality of food is consistent and never disappoints. The Chicken Parmigiana served here is as good as that served in Martarano's, a more upscale/pricey choice which also tops our list of great local Italian restaurants. Are you going?

The balsamic and olive oils left tableside are high quality. And the antipasto platter is huge; even a half order would feed four people! \n\nBut the entire experience was marred by awful service that felt like being at an Applebee's and having a waiter-in-training. When we sat down, the menu had barely been presented when we were asked if we wanted to order - he totally misread us and thought we wanted a fast service instead of a relaxing meal (or else he just wanted the table turnover). I am able to look past that, we took our time, ordered, and when the antipasto platter came out, they had substituted a hard cheese for the fresh mozzarella which was disappointing.  When my waiter finally reappeared I asked him about it, and he said \"well it should\", shrugged, and walked away - no offer to fix it or even query the kitchen for an explanation. He also never offered a refill of the raved-about garlic knots - I didn't particularly need them given the size of the platter, but an offer would have been nice and appropriate.  He also brought our entrees prior to the appetizer platter being finished - poor timing by either himself or the kitchen, again expecting fast turnover instead of a relaxing meal. Definitely the opposite of \"authentic Italian\"!\n\nFinally, older reviews talk about a hard to find quiet spot, but the current location is in the food court so there is a lot of foot traffic walking by. In conclusion, even though the food is good (three-star), there are many good Italian places in Las Vegas to dine at, so I can't recommend Trattoria Reggiano."

Nice warm bread served with EVOO and balsamic to start. Shared a caprese salad to start. Definitely a shareable portion. Buffalo Mozzarella was creamy. Tomatoes were a bit mealy.\n\nI had the spaghetti puttanesca. Yum. Lots of good things like capers and olives. It had anchovies but they weren't overpowering. My mom ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs are their specialty and it showed. They were juicy and flavorful. Portion sizes are generous.

Menu prices are high for a hotel restaurant.  We started with the delicious garlic knots, then shared a kale peanut salad (crunchy and tasty), veal milanese (light and crispy light batter with arugula sprinkled on top) and lobster ravioli!  I liked the veal milanese more than the lobster ravioli although they were both pretty good.

Based on the reviews I read on yelp, we thought we'd give Trattoria Reggiano a go. We weren't disappointed. \n\nNever have walked through the maze of shops within and around The Venetian, so we enjoyed the stroll to find T.R. tucked into a small curve in The Grand Canal Shoppes.  We arrived around 5:00 and had our choice of dining 'in' or 'patio' (which basically means the wide side-walk of the shoppes). We joined two other parties on the patio (it's always entertaining to people watch in Vegas!). \n\nWarmly greeted by Amanda (who was fabulous); gave us time to look over the menu. I wasn't sure about the chianti served by the glass and she offered to get me a sample. Pleasantly surprised to find it was a nice little chianti and was poured a very full glass of wine ($11).   Hubby and I decided on a starter of Filet Mignon Meatballs ($12) since many reviews highlighted them; very good start to the meal. Good flavor, great sauce, and nicely proportioned.  \n\nFor dinner, my husband order the Salsiccia pizza ($15) while I, based on Amanda's suggestion, tried the special of  mushroom fettuccine ($16).  In the meantime, the home made garlic rolls arrived (yummy) along with the above mentioned meatballs. May I add...the leftover pomodoro sauce from the meatballs is amazing with the garlic rolls. Hey, we're on vacation, calories and carbs don't count, right?  Our entrees were served within 12-15 minutes.  \n\nMy husband enjoyed his pizza - especially the pieces of fresh garlic that were cooked in the pizza sauce. Said it had very good flavor although it didn't look anywhere as good as it tasted. The crust was nicely browned; crisp but a nice soft center. However, he agreed that my dish was definitely better.  The pasta was cooked slightly al dente (perfect); the sauce was delicious and not too overwhelming (as I've had at other restaurants); and the mushrooms gave a wonderful depth and texture to the dish.  Amanda had said it was her favorite meal but typically is only served once a month. Lucky me - it was wonderful. \n\nThe pizza was enough for two as was my pasta. As we (luckily) have a hotel room with a kitchenette, we took the leftovers with us.  Nice late night snack after spending an evening in the casino, lol.  The ambiance of T.R. is quite nice; quaint vibe of a Italian cafe much like you see when visiting Italy. As we visited for an early dinner on a Monday night (10/8/12), there was seating available. But leaving an hour later, all the tables were full and I noted some people waiting. \n\nIf you're looking for some good Italian food, in a casual setting, with some top-notch service, you'll want to visit Trattoria Reggiano."

After finding it in a mall like food court within the Venetian we were surprised at how small it was! It was pretty packed, but we offered to wait, and it was worth it! The food was great and it was nice getting away from the craziness of Vegas for a little bit without breaking the bank.\n\nSadly, we were seated by a group of young drunk guys who were spilling their drinks and being loud and rude to the waitstaff. If we didn't have the misfortune of this, I would give the place 5 stars. I understand that this is more common when you're in Vegas, but I have to judge the overall experience fairly, and with the place being so small in size, it was very hard to ignore.. Outside of this, the restaurants was 5 stars itself, keep up what you're doing and maybe throw in a apology or two when your guests have to put up with other rowdy customers ;)."

I spent two years in Italy 25 years ago, and Trattoria Reggiano brought back tastes that I remember and forgot about 25 years ago when I was in Italy. The only difference between a restaurant in Italy and Trattoria Reggiano is the service: Trattoria Reggiano gives excellent, prompt service, whereas in Italy you might have to wait 45 minutes before somebody takes your order. Try the Vodka Pasta - a unique taste that very few American Italian restaurants have."

My husband and i got married at the Venetian resort, which is an amazing hotel, and we continue going there every year. The night before our wedding we and our four friends decided to go to this cozy looking Italian restaurant mainly the atmosphere seemed very nice and we love Italian food. \n\nHowever, I ordered a pasta dish not sure which one, with chicken and it came without, which I instantly noted to the waiter. Of course the waiter was apologetic, went to the kitchen to ask for the chicken, which I found very strange, perhaps even more strange when the chicken came out in a bowl, they had cooked the already frozen cooked chicken in cream in the microwave, so basically I was meant to add that to my pasta, It was hilariously disappointing, and our friends weren't very impressed about their pizzas either, and barely touched them."

The eggplant was pounded very thin and wrapped around a bit of cheese, all topped off with a vodka creme sauce and fresh parm. Typing this is seriously making me salivate... Anyway, it was the first restaurant we tried while staying at the Venetian and we should have just eaten there the whole weekend.  It couldn't get better.\n\nThe service was also fantastic.  Our server was very attentive and went above and beyond to make our dining experience enjoyable.  They were out of chocolate chips to sprinkle on the cannoli so she offered to go to Haagen Dazs to get us some!"

My linguini with white clam sauce was good and my wife thoroughly enjoyed all her food. Overall great experience in this small restaurant. It was a loud atmosphere so I wouldn't suggest it as a romantic date but a great place to catch dinner.

Everything from the filet mignon meatballs, to the cold antipasto platter, to the pasta, to the chicken, to the veal, to the seafood...it was all amazing. Like New York amazing. This was probably the best dinner we had during our 4 day stay. I only wish we had room for dessert. We were such fatties that there was no way we'd be able to eat something sweet and not need a nap. There was gambling to be done, after all!\n\nService was efficient and they made excellent recommendations when we were torn between a couple of items. They take pride in their food and it shows. You cannot go wrong here. The only negative is that it packs up quickly so you might have a little bit of a wait. But that's okay - put your name on the list and go shop for a bit. You'll be thrilled you did.\n\nBon appetit!"

The breadsticks are  delicious  (and complimentary) and  the food was a good portion. Not something you pay a lot for and get nothing.

Before writing this, I actually pulled up the photos to make sure we'd eaten at the right place!\n\nWe arrived at 8 and found a wait of about 15-20 minutes (after calling about 30 minutes earlier to inquire about the wait and make a reservation and being told we would have no problem being seated); oh well, not a big deal. We went next door to the magic shop and returned at 8:05 to the four parties or so waiting next to the host. The two parties in front of us were still planted inches from the host (including another party of two that had been waiting when we first arrived). As we stood there, we saw two people walk up to an empty table that had just been cleared. The host hurried up to the party and told them that the table hadn't been bused but there was a table in the back that had been and he led them to it. WTH?!  Clearly, this annoyed those of us waiting in line. After seeing this, a party of two that was AFTER us on the list rushed to the host and demanded to be seated. And they were. Just like that. My husband talks to the host and of course we are blamed because he called our name and we didn't answer. Hmm, so he called our name within 5 minutes of us arriving (after JUST estimating that the wait would be 15-20 minutes), ignored the fact we'd been making active eye contact with him since, and somehow he called our name before he called the parties of the same size immediately in front of us in line. Right. Dude, no sympathy for the fact I've been waiting patiently with a big pregnant belly?\n\nFor some reason, we stayed and the host did apologize for the wait when he finally seated us--but not for being unfair and likely dishonest about calling us. The garlic rolls were tough and bland except for the topping. The service was polite, rushed. We saw our waiter a few brief times. The gnocchi itself was very good; the pesto lacked bite. The meatballs were the highlight. \n\nOverall, a disappointing experience!"
