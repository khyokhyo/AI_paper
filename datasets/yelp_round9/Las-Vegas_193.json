            "review": "Let me just start out with that fact that the food here is amazing! Everyone at the table loved their food (except my brother who is 11 and was sick, so he hardly counts) \nWe started off with the truffle fries which were to die for and then were gone in a few seconds. :) For dinner I got the coconut shrimp and the spicy tuna roll because they were on the appetizer menu and I assumed that they would be small portions. Instead they were massive and I couldn't even finish them all. They were amazing and I would suggest them to anyone. It was classic flashy Vegas food :) I loved every bite. \n\nIt was a little bit loud, but it's Vegas so it wasn't like I didn't expect it and there was a slightly long wait to get in which was just frustrating. \n\nThe staff were nice for the most part and very accommodating. Overall it was a positive experience.\n\nMake time for the Yard House!"

            "review": "My wife and I found this place while searching for a good lunch option. We absolutely enjoyed everything we tasted. The cool thing about this place is you can get a lot of options at a lot of price ranges. I had the shiitake garlic noodles, which were incredibly flavorful. My wife had the barbecue chicken pizza and French onion soup. The crust had a little essence of that beer flavor, which tasted great with the barbecue pizza sauce. They also had mini deserts that were just the right size after the meal. Service was very friendly and attentive. The location is nice as it has a good view of the high roller wheel from the second floor. They had lots of beer choices as you would expect, but we didn't get a chance to try them. We will have to come back again!"

            "review": "The Yard House was highly recommended to us by our Brother-In-Law. Great suggestion because this place was fantastic!\n\nAtmosphere has a dark, casual, pub. Very comfy booths. \n\nBeer list is AMAZING! I think there were something like 150 beers on tap. Yup- ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BEERS ON TAP. My husband got a flight where he sampled 6 beers for about $10. I on the other hand, had to go the non-alcoholic route and had the passion fruit iced tea. It was delicious and very refreshing! Highly recommend! \n\nAs for food, we arrived during their \"Happy Hour\" which ran from 3-6pm. We shared the $5 Onion Ring Tower and the $6 chicken strips. I wasn't too hungry to begin with and there was SOOOO MUCH FOOD. I don't know if it's my heightened sense of smell and taste but the food, although was pretty good (my husband loved it), tasted too much like grease to me. \n\nService was superb!! Our waiter was awesome! He was very attentive and friendly. My iced tea glass never ran dry. \n\nWe really think you should give this place a try!!!"

There was a 30 minute wait so we went to the bar to hang out while we waited. The bar has a great selection of beer, had trouble choosing what is get. Bartender let me  try out a couple beers before making a decision, I always like that.\n\nUnfortunately the service took a bit of a bad turn once we got a seat at the bar to eat dinner. We waited a good amount of time for the guy who was previously serving us to take notice, not to mention anyone else. Had to call out to someone to finally get noticed. Got some chips and guacamole, it was delicious, as well as the fish and chips. No complaints about the food, I must mention the fries are pretty good, thinly cut and crispy.\n\nI'd come back, but I won't be having dinner at the bar again."

The portion is huge and the side salad is a great touch. The burger itself was decent, and I like that there was an effort to make an interesting vegan burger. There were lots of components to the burger (rather than just a vegan patty on buns); there was kale, vegan cheese, tomatoes, avocado, etc. When ordering the vegan burger, make sure your side is a SALAD with vegan balsamic dressing. The fries are not vegan!! \n\nI wanted to try their other gardien items, but I was wary about what was and wasn't vegan so I just went with the vegan burger."

            "review": "A few hours after I arrived in Vegas on July 9, 2015, I went to the Yard House with a few friends and my boyfriend for dinner. The monorail station was pretty close, so it only took five minutes to get here. Since my friends were able to get a table before everyone arrived, there wasn't any need to wait in line that slithered out the front entrance. The atmosphere was lively with loud music. We sat in a booth and our server was definitely as energetic and jolly as the atmosphere.\n\nI ordered the Korean Pork Belly taco plate with beans and rice. Two friends ordered a salmon dish with Wasabi mashed potatoes and a side of vegetables. Another friend ordered a burger and the other ordered a taco plate similar to mine. My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya. We also had some appetizers, which were just as flavorful.\n\nWhen our food arrived, everyone enjoyed their meals and we had the time of our life. The Korean Pork Belly Tacos were crispy, juicy, and slightly spicy. I'm salivating just thinking about it. Two friends that ordered the salmon dish with Wasabi mashed potatoes did not finish their meals, so I decided to try one of the mashed potatoes. Who has ever had Wasabi mashed potatoes anyway? I haven't, so I tried it and loved how the Wasabi wasn't overpowering at all. I basically finished it and didn't have room for dessert.\n\nOverall, service was beyond excellent. Prices were decent. I spent less than $25 on my meal plus a drink. The food was incredibly delicious. Wasabi mashed potatoes? Korean tacos? YES PLEASE!"

The burger was packed full (overstuffed) with goodness, possibly if they had less ingredients it would be just as good I'm sure. The onion rings blew me away, probably the best I've ever had, definitely try those. For dessert I had the apple and peach cobbler and it was scrumptious! It was like a smaller version of the Blue Martini's apple tart a la mode. I will definitely visit Yard house again! Our waiter was quite courteous as well, the customer service was certainly an A+. I recommend trying out the apple and peach cobbler here first then on another day getting the apple tart a la mode at BM. Prepare yourself, the apple tart a la mode is the best dessert that exists ever! Oh and it is pretty big!"

The food itself was not spectacular at all. My wife loves Brussels sprouts but she couldn't even eat the ones they brought out. They were called crispy Brussels sprouts under the snack section of the menu. They deep fried them whole with potato chunks and served them on top of a spicy aioli. The cooking method led the Brussels sprouts to become chewy and tough as they cooled down. And it was just too much mayo for me. \n\nI got the chopped salad and had them add iceberg lettuce. It came out with an avocado half sliced paper thin and spread out on top of the salad. It was gorgeous and I couldn't wait to dig in. The dressing ended up being awful. It tasted like thousand island, but was pink, maybe from ketchup? It was basically pickly mayonnaise but was sweet. It ruined the salad for me. \n\nOn the bright side the hummus did come in a huge portion. Plenty for 4 people to split as long as you order extra pita. \n\nI'm not anxious to go back, but since they are open until late and have a super diverse menu I probably will give them a second try."

We were able to order from the full menu.  I opted for the summer salad (delicious) and my daughter the bbq pizza which she too enjoyed. We happened to have the same server from my prior visit.  The food was quick and the tasty.  The atmosphere was casually sophisticated (aside from the cackling chics down the bar from us).  I'll certainly return when for table seating when I have time to take my time and enjoy this restaurant.  Although, the gentlemen next to me received his burger incorrectly made twice... they were prompt to replace it and genuinely apologetic, comping his meal and offering him an appetizer to hold him over.  Their service is A+ in my book, but I'll have to try more items from the menu before I can give them 5 stars!"

The bartender working the bar on August 14, 2016 at about 9:05pm was completely rude. Our whole trip here in Las Vegas was amazing. We definitely regret stopping by the yard house outside bar in the alley between the linq and flamingo.\n\nIf you, as a worker have no tolerance for people visiting the strip or a certain amount of people you do not need to be working with people directly. The manager came out and automatically came off rude just like her employee. Never have we ever felt disrespected by any bar before and the employee at the yard was the first EVER. She made the mistake and miscounted the amount of people drinking and asked us once again for our ID's. Twice. Then she gets on the walky talky to call the manager, who didn't even help the situation. We decided to walk away because we will not tolerate being mistreated in any way. Instead we walked right over to the AMERICAN. The gentleman there was great."

I'm a local who lives on the strip and will be back repeatedly. Great staff, great service, great location, great looking restaurant. I posted a photo of the chicken avocado sandwich on the menu. I modified it to come with no bun (along with several other modifications) and it came out better than my expectations. The effort behind the presentation and customer satisfaction is obvious."

Really interesting decor, lots of televisions for the sports fans and a lot, I mean a lot of beer, they actually have 4 pages of their menu dedicated to beer, so there are lots to choose from. It was very busy when we got there, but our server was great. She was helpful and answered all of our questions. We ordered our food and it arrived about 25 mins later, as I said it was very busy. All I have to say is that the wait was definitely worth it, the food was divine, as in I wanted to keep on eating, but I was just too full, ( why can't I have two stomachs !?! ) their portion sizes are big here, so you can share the main courses with your significant other and get a snack or appetizer and try something new along with your main meal. I would definitely come back here as they have a meat substitute section on the menu- so to all of my vegetarian friends out there, you too can have your very own soy chicken wings, should you so choose, I did not have them, but will be giving them a try when I come back. Give this place a try and you will not be disappointed, I know I wasn't!"

We had a short window of time(an hour) to eat before our meeting, but had to rush through food because it took so long for our sandwiches to come out.  \n\nWe each got a sandwich, they forgot the avocado on my coworkers sandwich, and the cheese on mine.  She got a little cup of avocado when she asked, but I just did without the cheese for time sake.  The food is very good, and the french fries that come with the sandwiches are awesome! They are skinny little shoe string french fries that almost have a texture of batter dipped fries...I don't know but they were very good.  The turkey on my  sandwich was difficult to eat in sandwich form, but had great flavor(thick cut, and then warmed up on the grill top I think based on the marks on it). They gave me a soda in a  to go cup when asked since we rushed through eating.  \n\nMy main complaint is just that it took so long for our food to come out. We ordered what we thought was quick food because we knew we were on a short time constraint. It was pretty empty inside so we thought that would help also, but it didn't.  I would  eat here again, but when I have more than an hour."

It's the usual restaurant-with-bar atmosphere -- loud chatter and big screen TVs everywhere.\n\nTwo of the people in my party ordered the HUGE turkey pot pie, one ordered a salad, and I ordered chicken tenders with fries. The shoestring fries were delightfully well-seasoned and crispy! And, the chicken was moist and cooked just right. The breading seemed airy and light, so it gave me the impression that it wasn't as cholesterol-laden as normal chicken tenders. I'm sure I'm wrong. The pot pies and the salad were devoured, so I'm guessing my friends really enjoyed their meals as well.\n\nOur server was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Near the end of the meal, she had to take a short break, so she introduced us to another server who would take her place. Our replacement server was nice as well. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely come here again."

I frequent the Chino Hills location when visiting my sister, and the Marina del Rey location is a recent favorite due to their proximity to my job. On my recent trip to Las Vegas, I got to check out this location, which is in the new Linq complex on the strip. I didn't get to eat at this location, but we visited the walk-up bar our first night in town (7/1/14) to try what has become my favorite Vegas drink: FROZEN. MOSCOW. MULE. I don't usually go for frozen drinks and was going to order mine on the rocks, but watched the bartender make one for the folks ahead of us in line. It looked so good and it was about 100 degrees at 10 pm so I decided to go for it. Oh my....the best $10.50 plus tip I spent in Vegas! So good that my sister and I returned to the Linq our second night in town (7/2/14) specifically for this drink! I wish I could remember the names of the bartenders because they were both awesome - there was a male bartender 7/1 and a female bartender 7/2. \n\nThis was a short trip, if we didn't return home yesterday we would have returned for a third night. It was THAT good, and I'm not even a big drinker."

You definitely could taste the truffle flavor that's so rich. I also tried the blueberry ketchup as my dip, and that was okay. They did it well, where you can taste the ketchup but also the sweetness of the blueberry, but I didn't really enjoy it, at least not with fries. One bite would taste like ketchup, another would taste like blueberry jam.\n\nThey also have a great selection of beers and a wide variety, from light lagers, to sours, to stouts, whatever you like they have at least a couple beers for it.\n\nThe server was attentive and helpful in deciding on our choices, but also was just a tiny bit off-putting with his hate of vegetarian dishes.

I researched beforehand because my bf is Vegetarian. Heard that Yard House serves Gardein dishes. A little skeptical because my boyfriend doesn't like a lot of food and sticks to the basics. Also, I will say I was being a little selfish...I wanted to try their Truffle Burger (me no vegetarian). \n\nOur server was really bright and cheerful (I'm not great at remembering names). She took our drink orders and kept them coming throughout the whole meal. So, my boyfriend ordered the Gardein Grilled Chicken and Avocado Sandwich with fries (I was still skeptical). And, I did order the Black Truffle Cheeseburger with tomato bacon jam & fries.  Oh my gosh!!!  They were both mouthwatering!!!  So scrumptious.  My bf said I found a winner. And, he does not enjoy a lot of different foods.  You do not know what this means. \n\nOf course we came back the next day to check out some other dishes on the menu. Our server was a guy today (still did not remember names, sorry). Same thing, bright & cheerful and kept our drinks coming. \n\nThis time I ordered the Sweet Potato Fries with Maple Bacon Cream Dip (ask for more if you run out of dip). Oh my gosh, these were the best tasting fries ever and I could eat the dip all day long!!!  Phenomenal. Also ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola Flatbread. Said it was in the Snack section. Was bigger than snack portions. And it was amazing. My bf ordered the Chopped Salad, Tomato Bisque and the Mini Peach Apple Cobbler. He loved, loved, loved his order as well. So much so that he called the Manager over and told him how much we loved both visits, complimented both servers for both days and explained how much he loved the meal. I mean...this is big with him because with him being Vegetarian, not a lot of great choices out there.  Coupled with the fact that he is finicky. But, he was so impressed with this restaurant. The manager asked us where we are from (L.A.) and let us know there's some here as well. WE WILL BE FREQUENTING THEM. And, also will be coming back to this location as he is a Poker Tournament player and we visit Vegas often. \n\nSo happy to have found this place. Thank you all at Yard House."

There were more families there while we were.  Our server was attentive.  Our friends' child did receive apple juice instead of orange juice (the waitress did repeat \"orange juice\" when it was ordered, so I know she took that order correctly), but the kiddo was a good sport about it and drank it because it was taking forever to flag the server down (we never did).  The menu itself has way too many choices that it's overwhelming when you first look at it.  I'd recommend not opening it if you are indecisive, because it will only give you a full blown panic attack. My husband was ecstatic with the beer selection and enjoyed his mac n' cheese because bacon.  He wasn't overly excited about the French Onion Soup--which is one of his favorite dishes and he frequently gets this at other restaurants, too.  I had asked the server about the street tacos.  I wasn't really interested in the entire meal, and asked if the \"ala carte\" designation meant the tacos (plural, quantity with the meal is 2 tacos) and just NOT the beans/rice, to which she agreed it was. Our conversation went like this when I asked for clarification after she recommended ala carte as a way to \"mix n match\" tacos since I wasn't sure which one I wanted: \"So ala carte is the taco portion without the rice and beans?\" \"Exactly!\" She didn't tell me it was really priced PER taco, and the menu isn't exactly clear.  I got the carnitas and fish tacos after asking for her recommendation and she listed all of them but two.  Unexpectedly, two tacos came (one of each), and were $8.40ish for BOTH.  Street tacos should never, EVER be this expensive.  And our server never returned so I could ask her for clarification  I just wrote it off and figured I'd Yelp about it, and hopefully warn others that the \"ala carte\" price of $4-$6 is PER taco.  Still ridiculous.  I will be fair and say they were OK tacos, but certainly not worth $4 each.  In all honesty, I can't review the other food."

We love the beer selection and the food is great but we go because of the awesome service.  We recently went to the LINQ location off the strip and were blown away.  Ali and Joshua made our day.  It was the last day of our trip and they made it amazing.  They made us feel right at home, suggested local brews, and kept us happy and engaged.  It may seem silly that a lunch can make your day but truly, they made ours.  With all the selections in vegas often with rude and disinterested wait staff this Yardhouse blows them all away.  If you want a near endless beer selection, great food  with a huge menu, and seriously unmatched service head to Yardhouse at the LINQ."

Surprisingly they weren't busy, no wait to be seated or anything. As soon as we sat we waited about 12 mins for someone to even take our drink order. Finally when Rachell asked us what we wanted to drink it wasn't till about another 10 mins till we received our waters. \n\nWhen she returned she seemed like she was in a rush. We quickly ordered, then the waiting game began again. The amount of wait time is really unacceptable for what we ordered. I LOVE the food here which is why we constantly come back but it's the service and wait time that has me taking other options at times. \n\nThis time around the Poke Stack which I love wasn't fresh, the chicken fingers had no flavor neither did the fries. Other then that the food is really a bang for your buck. I don't know why the service is so inconsistent. Rachell was not friendly not approachable and gave the vibe that she was to busy to attend. \n\nThe manager on duty walked past us and we requested to change the chicken finger order he was very friendly and served us efficiently. Everytime we come across management they are beyond helpful it's the servers that need some costumer service training. Don't look so upset when your serving your customers it gives an unapproachable vibe. Then again that almost half the staff of YardHouse. The food is what keeps us coming back it's definitely not the customer service."

The patio seemed a great place. Temperature was super. Drink orders placed and our waiter Derek was trying hard despite probably oversubscribed on tables to attend to. Service was slowish; but we weren't in a hurry. Lemon drop came without the requested and standard sugar rim for my wife, but Derek took the drink back to make it right. They don't remake the drink. They just pour it into a rimmed glass. Second round- same mistake. But this time \"Tiffany\", a waitress with serious attitude and a mouth on her turns the day downward. Smart mouth, bad training. I left the table to talk to the manager (Beau) and simply request Tiffany serve others and not rain on our parade. Get this- the manager sends her AND her attitude back with the second failed drink; because that's \"her job.\"  \nLong story short. Beau and Tiffany need retraining. It's all about choices. We went two doors down and continued our celebration. \nFYI- one of our guests oversees casino experience and says she'll never recommend this Yard House, ever. \nBottom line - this Yard House came up two and a half feet short of a yard. Pass!"

I don't eat a lot of meat, but I really wanted a filet mignon for dinner - pretty much the only meat I order if I'm going to have dinner at a nice restaurant. For the price of around $22 for a petite filet mignon I wasn't expecting much, as I've had more than my share of filet throughout the years.\n\nI'm a weirdo though liking my meat well done, but after hearing a million people say you can't do that to a filet, I've been ordering it medium-well for close to 10 years.\nAppetizers & salads were great, service was prompt & my friend had her water glass refilled about 5 times haha. They were very accommodating with substitutions for sides and bringing us extra lemons for our water.\n\nThe first time my filet came out it was barely medium, so it was sent back & when it came out the 2nd time it was very well done. Although I was disappointed in this, they took it off my tab & I ate it. I could tell it was a very high quality piece of meat, even though it was well done. Definitely much better than I was expecting, & rivaled meat quality at places I'd paid twice as much for.\n\nI barely had room for dessert, but if there's one thing I love for dessert it's creme brulee, which they had. It was different with chocolate on the bottom & candied bananas on the top, but very delicious. Everything else about the food & experience was wonderful and I will definitely plan on coming back & trying again the next time I visit the area. :)"

Always a great go-to place since they have everything, 145 beers on tap, and service is always impeccable.\n\nCarnitas Enchilada Stack?   To die for.  That stuff is fantastic!  Even with the fried egg on top, and I probably would have never thought to throw an egg on top of an enchilada.\n\nThe one thing I was kind of annoyed with was that a friend ordered a Cuban roast dip sandwich.  It's supposed to be a hot sandwich.   The first time it came out it was barely warm.   Sent it back, and the manager came over to apologize and comp'd a drink which was actually amazing (and expected of Yard House's impeccable service).\n\nHowever, when the replacement sandwich came out, it actually was only a tad warmer than before.  My friend was so hungry (they flew in from the East Coast) and it was 10PM here that she said she loved it (and it is a fantastic sandwich) but I was a little miffed about it.  YH never let me down, and that was a bit of a total bummer when I have guests.\n\nGranted, my friends said that they'll still be back to try more Yard House, but I did wish that they figured out a way to get the cuban roast HOT before serving.  Especially in Vegas with no humidity, any hot items cool down super quickly and they need to be aware of that in the food prep business.\n\nAnyways, impeccable service!  The food (sans the temperature piece) and beers were amazing.   Will definitely continue to be a patron of YH, but I was slightly disappointed with that experience."

The service was very attentive, knowledgable, and were actually out to ensure you have a good experience. You can tell they're wonderful because the management is as well. I informed the host I had food allergies and the manager came right out to discuss all of my options. He even double checked with the kitchen on any small question I had. The server was just as careful, and had an entire conversation to learn more about food allergies. I ended up ordering a burger on a lettuce wrap and the meat itself was phenomenal. I am very picky with burgers, so that is saying a lot. The drinks are also amazing and 100% worth the price. I wish I could travel back to Vegas just to eat another meal!!"

Their beer selection is insane & they have a ton of signature cocktails as well.\n\nWe ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll for a starter and it was great.  It isn't the traditional roll in that there is no rice used.  I would call it more of a Spicy Tuna Tower.  The tuna is layered above a green onion, cucumber, and edamame mixture with avocado & cabbage on top with a sauce surrounding it on the plate.  It was beautiful to look at and the tuna was super fresh!\n\nI wasn't super hungry for dinner, so I appreciated the \"Snacks\" options they had.  I ended up ordering their guacamole & chips and crispy brussels sprouts with ripped potatoes. Both were amazing.  My only criticism would be that the brussels sprouts have a super tasty dipping sauce that you don't see until you've eaten the top layer.  They have it on the bottom, so once you are full you realize there was amazing dipping sauce that you could've been using the entire time.  I was disappointed in that, because it was hardly used due to plating.\n\nMy husband ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Breast that comes with creamed corn, bbq baked beans, mashed potatoes, and bourbon gravy.  It was really filling, but he had no complaints.  He loved it all.  We would definitely go back."

I remember mom got fried chicken, and the server was very accommodating to her likes and dislikes (with no eye rolling or impatience).

Their menu has a such wide variety... there is surely something for everyone. Another thing I've noticed about Yard House is that the restaurants themselves are enormous, so there is never a long wait time. This particular spot is very nice and new, located in the Linq area of the strip.\n\nMy husband and I came for lunch on our recent visit to Las Vegas. Though there are plenty of lunch specials to choose from, we each chose items off the regular menu instead. I had a large serving of the chicken and bacon mac & cheese and my hubby got a bbq chicken pizza. My pasta was delicious... plenty of chicken, bacon, and mushrooms mixed into the creamy and cheesy spiral macaroni noodles. My husband stated that his pizza had a great flavor and the perfect amount of sauce. \n\nWe had a $45 gift card, and after tax and tip, we used the entire balance plus gave another $2. This may sound a bit expensive for two lunches with iced tea, but had we ordered the lunch specials it would have been much less. I think this is a fair price to pay if we actually had our same meal at dinner time. \n\nI will definitely return to Yard House whether it be in Vegas or another city... until St. Louis finally gets on board.

This one is a perfect addition to the Linq area sandwiched between the Quad and Casino.\n\nIf you've never been to a Yard House, it's a bar/restaurant known for having a lot on tap, a pretty extensive food menu and providing plentiful options for vegans and vegetarians.\n\nTheir menu is reasonably priced (along with some happy hour specials), especially for Vegas. My favorite thing to do is order 2-3 appetizers and get to try a bunch of different things! My boyfriend and I came here a couple times while visiting Vegas so we got a pretty good read on this location.\n\nIt looks like the wait for tables can be a little lengthy. We sat at the bar to bypass it all. The service was quick and c'mon, there is SO MUCH on tap here. It's awesome.\n\nNot sure where to start? My food recommendations are:\n-Truffle fries: You really can't go wrong with these. Savory and great for sharing.\n-Guac and chips: They actually do a pretty solid guac here! Save the excess for smothering on your main course.\n-Ahi poke bowl: I would definitely ask for soy sauce to go with this, since it's a little bland otherwise. They'll bring you chopsticks if you want, but I basically inhaled this, it was so good!\n-French onion soup: Yes, I ordered a soup with a straight face at the bar. Twice. This was some of the best French onion soup I've ever had...perfectly flavored and boiling hot, crusted at the top with soup-absorbed bread and bubbling cheese. Yum. (PS- if you or someone in your group is getting an entree, you save about a $1.50 by adding the soup as a side instead of ordering a la carte.)\n-Gardein wings: One of the reasons I really enjoy Yard House is that it's vegan and vegetarian friendly. It's just friendly in general, as they also point out low calorie options on the menu, but I digress. Hands down, my favorite Gardein dish is the wings. They are perfect, from bite sized goodness to having a meaty texture that will satisfy and possibly fool some carnivores.\n-BBQ chicken pizza: Who doesn't love pizza in a bar? This one is top notch."

She did however apologize and offer to make us the dish; but it was getting late and I was hangry - so we just ate what we had.  No one else was blown away by their food either.  Don't get me wrong, it was OK, but felt like I could get it anywhere in town.  It's just a bar with a bit better than bar food.

It was really nice, tables clean, etc.  I'm pretty sure we had 2 waitresses but they looked pretty similar so it's hard to tell.  One of their names was Magdalene (according to the receipt).  As far as keeping our drinks filled they did great, which we needed because......it was an hour before we saw our entrees (and this is being generous.)\n\n     Once we noticed, without a doubt, that people who arrived after us were receiving their food before us, my friend asked about our orders.  Our waitress replied that \"it should only be another 3 to 5 minutes,\" but she would go check.  (How she would know 3-5 minutes before she went to look is beyond me, but I digress.)  She comes back and says they're plating it now, it will be out soon. Our  food did come at this point, and like I said, we all loved our food.  \n\n     The waitress brought our check without us having to ask for it - that was good.  There were 4 of us, and we were all paying for our own meal, so it was split payment between cash and credit.  There was more than enough to cover the bill, because like I said, we were each paying our own meal.  I told her to charge my card first and for how much, and to use the cash after.  She walks away and we see her go to the computer for a while, then she disappears for another 5 minutes (again, generous).  When she returns, I open the folder and the only thing in there is my card and the slip for me to sign.  I'm clearly puzzled, because I knew we had change coming back.  She probably notices because she says...... wait for it......\n\n\"You guys didn't want change did you?\"\n\n     Ex-cah-use me?   She seriously tipped herself.  I've heard of (and experienced) automatically billed tips for large parties, but a) we were a party of four, b) this was not on the bill, and c) none of us have ever had a waiter or waitress just keep the change unless we said to.  Is this what gets done to tourist?   \n\n     She starts to walk away before any of us even reply, so I say \"Hold on.\"  My friend asks her how much change there was and she says \"Oh I'm not sure let me look\"  What?  Yes, you are sure - or maybe this is something you do all the time so it's hard for you to keep track.  \n\n     Just so you know Magdalene, since apparently you are not aware, it is up to the patron to decide how much and IF they tip you, not for you to decide based on how you think you did.  We would have tipped you, but based on principle - you do not make the choice to keep someone's money and ask questions later.  What you did was extremely rude.  We probably would have tipped you even more than you took,  so thanks for taking it upon yourself to reward yourself.  It saved us some money."

We came with a party of 10 and had to wait close to 30 min just for them to tell us how long the wait would be for our party. We finally decided to split our party into two groups so we could be seated faster. Our table ordered several dishes - lobster macaroni and cheese, pasta, pork rib appetizers and salad. Overall, nothing was very flavorful or tasty. The food quality has definitely declined which is a huge bummer. I would not rerun to this location."

Now that we've moved, we go to the location at the LINQ. Everything I have tried from this chain have been pretty good like the lobster, crab and artichoke dip, fried calamari and ahi poke bowl among others for appetizers. The pasta is great as well believe it or not, BUT I always revert to my favorite Seared Ahi steak sandwich, I'm hooked! I mean what's not to love, it's seared perfectly on the outside and raw inside, with the addition of the caramelized onion and peppercorn aioli? It's the perfect marriage. Try it, you wont be disappointed. Their menu is extensive so it'll take several visits to try most of them. It's a cool and fun place to hang out, chill vibe. They have something for everyone, be it beers on tap or girly cocktails, whatever floats your boat basically. As far as desserts, I love the chocolate souffl\u00e9 and macadamia nut cheesecake. The smores brownie was pretty good, decadent even but it's a tad too sweet for me."

But the service was terrible. We came here on a Friday a little before noon, and got seated immediately. Our waitress, Emmie, came to greet us as we were seated and took our drink orders. However, it took about 10 minutes before our drinks came to us. 10 minutes to get our drinks! How ridiculous is that? We eventually got our orders placed, which was the Lobster, Crab & Artichoke dip for our appetizer to share, the Grilled Korean Pork Belly Street Tacos for me and the Asada Street Tacos for my boyfriend. \n\nIt took a good 30-45 minutes before our food came out, and by that time, my drink was running low. I had placed my empty glass at the end of the table in hopes somebody would come up and offer to give me a refill, but that didn't happen. We were seated in a booth close to the kitchen, numerous employees had passed by our table, so it's not like we were hidden. But they just passed by our table, overlooking my empty glass. Emmie finally took notice (she seemed very oblivious, not good work ethic!) and gave me a refill, apologizing that their computers were down and the food orders were backed up. We could understand that our food might take a while, but getting a drink refilled? Again, absolutely ridiculous. Eventually, all our food came out...including the appetizer that we specifically asked to be brought out first before our main dishes. Thankfully, the food looked delicious to make up slightly for this.\n\nThe Lobster, Crab & Artichoke dip was DELICIOUS. It came with pieces of pita bread and chips, and I really liked it with the pita bread. We both really enjoyed the dip, we just wished it came out before the main dishes did. The tacos were phenomenal. My boyfriend enjoyed his Asada tacos (I had a bite and they were quite tasty!) and my Grilled Korean Pork Belly tacos were nothing short of awesome. Each taco dish came with 2 tacos, a scoop of their spicy rice, and a small bowl of beans. The meat in both tacos were cooked to perfection, not too much that it had a charred taste. The rice was alright, the beans could have been better. \n\nBy the end of our meal, we both had empty glasses (received no offer on refills, what is up with this place and getting drinks??) and we waited about 10 minutes to get the check. Overall, I'd say the food rocked more than the service did!!"

However it didn't have the buttery goodness as how it's served at the Irvine Spectrum location. My husband had the lobster and crab omlette. The small bite I had, the egg seemed over cooked. My brother-in-law had the seared ahi that he enjoyed very much.\n\nDinner and family conversation was going well until the alley singer came back from \"lunch\" to finish her gig. The music playing in YH was already loud so adding the high pitch alley singer, who also had her sound louder than YH, started to give us a headache. Unfortunately, because the alley singer has a performers permit, they couldn't shut her down. \n\nOn top of that, the tourist sitting at the table next to us had too much to drink that he didn't make it to the restroom and barfed against the restaurant wall behind me. I wouldn't have noticed because it was so loud, but it was at my brother-in-law side view that he saw it all. The servers were quick to clean up after the incident.\n\nI have to say that our server was absolutely fabulous.\n\nSo despite all that was unpleasant with this location, I still love YH, just won't be returning to this location anytime soon."

The food menu has a ton of options but we kept it simple & went with sandwiches. I had the grilled cheese with truffle fries instead of the tomato soup it comes with. The sandwich was perfectly melted and had some tomato on it. Good but nothing special. The truffle fries were fabulous!! A lot of truffle flavor....didn't want to quit eating them. My husband had the turkey & bacon melt 2.0. He really loved it. It had nice thick carved slices of turkey, cheese, bacon, roasted tomatoes, & jalape\u00f1o spread. Not very spicy. Delicious. \n\nThe beer list is extensive. A paradise for beer lovers. We would definitely go back."

We took a look at the menu outside and noticed the place wasn't too busy yet so we decided to take a seat. (P.S. they have specialty beers)\n\nMENU:  AWESOME!  The Menu had such a great selection for my pallette.  So many choices, but I went for one of my favorites, the BBQ Cheddar Burger.  Dude, this was the BEST burger I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  There was NOTHING wrong.  Flavors were perfectly balanced!  So good!\n\nPRICE:  Good.  The prices were right where I expected.  Lunch for two was around $45, with a specialty beer.  \n\nSERVICE:  GREAT!  This was a HUGE winner for us.  We were greeted by a manager in training and the lady training.  She did a great job at letting the trainee have full control.  The trainee was honest and had been in the industry before, which was totally fine!  We asked him questions that, in my opinion, most trainees would stutter around.  We also had him make the choice of which meal my wife was going to eat, and which beer I was going to drink.  PERFECT CHOICES!  The guy did a GREAT job and I think him becoming a manager is an EXCELLENT business choice!\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  Incredible.  Personally, I was blown away by this experience.  It was simply incredible and we will be eating there next time we are in town!"

It came with spicy rice and beans.  It liked small but  to be honest, it was a perfect sized portion for that late in the evening.  It was fresh and very tasty.  My partner had a burger with shoestring fries.  He liked it but he only ate half because he was not too hungry.  He asked for the burger with cheese and pickles only, and they mistakenly added garlic aioli.  He tries it and he say it was fine.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, the extremely nice waiter said he will buy us dessert because if the mistake.  It was but necessary but very nice. \n\nThe meal was very good and we recommend it to anyone because of  the large menu, delicious food and the great service."

Everything, especially the duck wings, tasted incredible and filled with flavor. I really enjoyed the Hot Chicken with cinnamon pancakes. This was a great play on chicken and waffles. \n\nLet me start by saying we only waited 15 minutes for a table of 7 on Saturday night. This was awesome. We could also get drinks from an outside bar as we waited.They do limit you to one drink per person at a time to ensure that you do not over do it. I think this is a great business practice especially on the strip. \n\nOnce seated, our waiter (a tall friendly gentleman named James) quickly provided us with water. He then routinely came by to take our orders as we would make up our minds. No glasses were ever empty. The food he brought us was incredible and he truly seemed interested in ensuring we had a good experience. \n\nI don't know what could be done to make this experience better other than asking other loud guests to quiet down lol.

I ordered a vegan burger but when I started to order fries, they admitted the oil is shared.  Glad to know, and not interested.  I am sure this is the case at most places and it sicks me out.  Vegan burger was tasty, salad was fine.\n\nHere is the good stuff - the menu is such that basically anyone could find something that is suitable.  The beer and drinks are plentiful.  And the prices, compared to what is surrounding the place, are not horrid.  Also there wasn't a wait.\n\nIt is down a pedestrian only \"street\" so make sure to look for the arrows."

The Yard House particularly caught my eye and I said on our next visit this was a place that we would eat! Almost a year later, we were back and I was ready to give this place a try! We came to this location on a Saturday, after spending all day in the pool. We arrived around 3pm and there were very few people in here(guess we missed the lunch traffic). We were immediately greeted and taken to our table. For some reason we were seated with the waiter that was doing the most that day. One gentleman came by to get our drink order because our waiter was at another table. Finally, our waiter came and gave us the initial greeting. After he gave us time to look over the menu, another waitress came with our drinks. After a few more minutes our waiter finally returned to take our order. Let me tell you the menu here is EXTENSIVE! There is something here for everyone! They also have a full bar and over 100 different beers. My husband ordered a salad, I ordered a taco (I believe it was the Baja fish taco) and artichoke crab and lobster dip, and my brother ordered calamari and a burger with fries. The crab dip and calamari came out first---with a different waiter. Let me start with the artichoke dip-- how you do you say WONDERFUL!! This is some of the best artichoke, crab, and lobster dips I have ever had-- we finished this in minutes of it reaching the table. The calamari was pretty good the only issue was the restaurant fries pieces of lemon peels and mixed it in  with the fried calamari and I ate a lemon peel and wasn't happy with the tart taste. My taco was delicious! Everything on the taco was fresh and it was well put together. My brother's burger was massive. I didn't care to taste it but I took a piece of his yummy bacon from the burger and some of his fries. My husband opted to be healthy and eat a salad. His salad was actually pretty tasty along with one of the house dressings and chicken that was on it. I also ordered the House Tropic cocktail. It was ok, didn't find it to really peak my taste buds. At the end it was hard for us to find our waiter--they really over booked him--- so we tracked down another waiter and asked for our check. The price of food is decent in my opinion and the atmosphere in here makes you feel like you're in cool local bar and no longer in Vegas. Really enjoyed our meal here!"

For lunch: I had the Cuban while my other half had the Roast Beef Dip sandwich. Both were huge and delish! Late-night to-go orders: The Chicken Enchilada stack was spicy and yummy. The BBQ Burger didn't disappoint either. Prices were the best: $15-18 per plate (less for the burgers), staff were professional and fun...what a combo! Did I mention their beer/cider list? I was torn between a few ciders, and our server graciously brought me some free samples. $7.00 for a pint of delicious cider. To find this awesome spot from the Linq: follow the signs to the High Roller (ferris wheel). Yard House is directly across from the Ticket window, beneath the High Roller. Enjoy!!"

Lots of activity to observe as you walk to the yardhouse. \n\nI had 3 street tacos (chicken tinga, Korean pork belly, blackened swordfish). All were very good as spices chosen hot the palate in many areas. Did the Belgian and ipa beer flights/tasters and enjoyed trying many beers for a leer price. Great service and lively atmosphere"

Our server, Frank, if I remember correctly, gave us such amazing service. He recommended a whole bunch of different beers and when we couldn't decide, brought out some samples for us to try multiple times. \n\nThe food wasn't anything spectacular but it was good and did the trick. For the price though, it was fantastic. If you're here for lunch, definitely get the lunch special. \n\nAt the end of our meal, Frank brought out a birthday dessert for my boyfriend. We were pleasantly surprised and it was nice that he remembered that little fact from the beginning of our conversations, even though it was a few days away. \n\nTo top it all off, he brought us some to go cups of water to keep hydrated on our walk along the strip. All servers need to meet his standard!"

            "review": "Descriptive phrase: hip, cool sports pub with poor service.\n\nYard House is a chain, and this one in the Linq is just as cool and clean as any other. When a big group of us came to watch the Final Four basketball games it was obvious we were gonna be there for a while and drop a chunk of change. We did, considering each half yard of beer is at least $14 and my own Chicken Nachos was $11.45 (good, by the way).\n\nBut the overwhelming impression I left with was how horrendous the service was. It wasn't even that busy at first, and it took 20 minutes in between visits from our server. And each time she came she'd only take 1 or 2 people's orders (of the 10ish of us), then leave again. \n\nThe place has many TVs with games on, yet they refuse to turn the game sounds on, even though that night especially most of their patrons were there to watch the Final Four. Annoying.\n\nWhen the bill finally came they would not split it. I understand some places refuse to do that, which I think is stupid, but whatever. However, when we went through the bill there were a ton of things that we didn't order. We brought that to their attention, and they changed it...to more wrong things. It took us legitimately 30 minutes to figure out what they did wrong and explain it them before they could change it correctly. They said they'd comp us a beer for the trouble, but those never came. \n\nThe only reason this isn't a 1 star is because the food, beer, and atmosphere is still good. And the crowd, even the opposing fans, were all friendly and jovial. But I wouldn't come back solely because of the service."

            "review": "On a cold night, prior to seeing a show at the Brooklyn Bowl, my wife and I decided to pop into Yard House for some dinner.  Despite being pretty busy, we were able to get seated in a reasonable amount of time.  We got seated out on the patio area, with a heater lamp providing ample warmth.  The view was amazing.  Unfortunately, the patio hovers right above the sidewalk where everyone ducks outside to smoke.  So your meal has a tendency to be accompanied with a fair amount of second hand smoke as it all wafts up into an otherwise beautiful spot.  Yard House would be wise to ban smoking within 25 feet of their establishment. \n\nThe prices are also outrageous, of course, because it is on the strip.\n\nThe service was awful.  We saw our server briefly as she dropped off our menus and took our drink order.  And then she disappeared.  We didn't get our drinks or see the server for close to 15 minutes after that.  This was not looking good, especially because we were trying to catch a show shortly after dinner.  When she finally returned, we were able to put in our dinner order.\n\nI was feeling adventurous, so I decided to go with the lamb burger, despite generally not liking lamb.  I would not truly understand the depth of my folly until much later in the evening.  The food itself tasted pretty good, at the moment I ate it.  The waitress continued to disappear, so by the time we were able to get our check and get out of there, we barely made it to the show, despite having left plenty of time.\n\nIt wasn't until a couple of hours later, when we arrived home, that my stomach began its revolt.  I had made it through nearly 3 decades of existence without getting food poisoning and I had been done in by a lamb burger.  As good as that burger tasted when I ate it, it didn't taste good at all when I vomited it up several times throughout the night.  The destruction of my body lasted nearly a full day and a half, with very little sleep and whole lot of bodily functions.  The paranoia it left me with, however, didn't quite leave me.\n\nMoral of the story?  Go to the Tilted Kilt instead.  Or literally anywhere else at the LINQ.  Because Yard House's food prep, accompanied by their prices and service, makes for one unforgettably terrible experience."

Got my buzzer, I anticipated a long wait as the patio is an extremely popular spot. The temperature and atmosphere makes the wait always worth it. 50 minutes go by and no buzzing on my Yard House hockey puck (I'm always forgiving on wait times). I ask the host, \"Hey, just wanted to make sure I'm still on the list... after flipping through 3 full pages of check ins.. \"oh, I called you (buzzed you) awhile ago...! Ok, I guess my ass is numb I'm thinking to myself. Fortunately, a bad ass manager is nearby (Jeff) who curiously and politely interrupts the host and gets me seated immediately! Thanks Jeff!\n\nI feel bad as I'm seated at a 4 top, but business levels are slowing down and there only a few 2 tops on the lower patio, soooo my guilt fades. \n\nHad my beer ready to order as I had about an hour to think about it. Server Kathryn took care of me promptly with water to start and my beer quick to follow. Order the shitake mushroom and garlic noodles to start under the \"snack\" portion of the menu. I get these almost every time I come here. Large enough portion to fill up on if you're enjoying beer, no jokes. After the noodle heaven I order the Beer Batter Fish and Chips for the first time. Again, promptly delivered with beer battered fries and a jalape\u00f1o tarter and an aoli (I forget the name, but it's delicious). The sauce sides are small so I immediately knew I would need additional tarter. The food runner (Kevin) asked if there was anything additional he could provide me. I quickly asked him if could get an additional tarter sauce from him and he politely ablidged! Thanks young man! \n\nAfter my first bite of fries I noticed they were cold and slightly stale. It also looked like I received the bottom of the barrel with most of the handful of fries being less than 2 inches long. Tough to grab, eat or dip. All good though, Server Kathryn checked in immediately and got me some fresh fries right away (although not beer bettered). No worries. They were hot and delicious!\n\nAlthough they were some issues this evening (out of the norm) you completely redeemed yourself. \n\nEvery place makes mistakes or errors. It's the genuine service recovery and effort that makes the biggest difference. You turned what could have been an abisimal , uncharacteristic experience into a phenomenal one. You deserve to be appriciated!!\n\nSO...THANK YOU!!!!- JEFF, KATHRYN, AND KEVIN.\n\nI'll be back....\n\nJacob-Out"

I am not much of a beer drinker so I was appreciative of their full bar. I recommend the pineapple Moscow mule (pineapple vodka, ginger beer and lime with a pineapple mint garnish). It was very refreshing. Aside from their rather large selection of beer and full bar, they have several items on their food menu (mainly American - a variety of sandwiches, pizza, tacos, wings, fries, salad, soup, fish and chips, salmon, chicken and much more). I like their truffle fries and sweet potato fries. The staff was nice and very attentive. I like that they provided the condiments before our meal came so we didn't have to ask. They also were generous with the limes after I had ordered a vodka tonic with extra limes."

I liked the vibe of the place and the waitress was a doll! She had such a pleasant attitude and had no problem seating me even though I arrived late and was informed that the kitchen would be closing in ten minutes. \n\nAfter  reviewing the menu and being told by the adorable waitress that the jambalaya was deelish....I was sold. The dish had shrimp, crawfish, blackened shrimp and sausage. I was shocked that the sausage and shrimp were seasoned,but was underwhelmed with how bland the pasta was. The dish was \"missing something\". It was not great. Just okay. Needless to say  I was not impressed with my meal at all. I did come late about ten minutes prior to the kitchen closing, but this is not a place that I care to visit again."

They will also bring you a tasting sample if you want to try something. We all had or tasted the pineapple, pear, and raspberry ciders and agreed the raspberry was probably the best of the three. \n\nQuite a few people got the fish tacos and liked them. I ordered the Korean taco and a carna asada taco. The Korean one was very good. I would not recommend the steak one it was merely okay. \n\nThe highlight of my meal was the side of Brussels sprouts and potatoes. If you like Brussels sprouts this is a must try.

It is easily going to become one of the most popular spots in Las Vegas. I can best describe it as a shopping/dining/nightlife area. It's really cool, classy, and unique~!!! \n\nYardhouse is definitely in that same area of classiness! I attended the Grand Opening event where they offered people with an invitation free food samples and 2 drink tickets (21+). It is a huge, two-story restaurant with a ton of workers. WOW it was so much fun! The waiters and waitresses were funny, attentive, and really wanted you to taste the entire menu that they had going around. \n\nMy favorite dishes were: the Southern Fried Chicken, Margherita Pizza, Chicken Tinga Tacos, & SUMMER SALAD!! (Best Salad Ever)\n\nMy absolute favorite \"girly\" cocktail is the House Tropic. I used both my drink tickets for 2 of those ;) \n\nAt the end, they even served out a banana and chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e!! It was an amazing night with great service, and I just cannot wait until they really open. Watch out, Vegas! YardHouse is coming out, bigger and BETTER than ever before!!!"

The fries were tiny cut which I absolutely abhor! I tasted very little truffle sauce, and no parmasan. Go to Gordan Ramsey's Burger to get the best truffle parmesan fries in las vegas!\n\nMoo Shu Egg Rolls were the highlight of the night. Perfectly fried, and seasoned, and came garnished with a bed of cabbage, and some nest of crisps?\n\nVerdict: Stick with the appetizers like The moo shu egg rolls and the artichoke dip, their salads, and skip the rest including their overpriced sandwich and drinks (unless its happy hour)"

This was my first time at the location in the Linq. Everything was really clean, spacious, and lively. Aaron, our server, was friendly, made sure our waters were kept full and was very attentive.\nI didn't really care for their jerk boneless wings. The sauce was on the side and I feel like it needed some breading, it was kind of weird. Parmesan crusted chicken was good. It had a mushroom and sun dried tomato sauce. My boyfriend got the New York Steak Sandwich so I had to steal a bite and it was good also! I thought it was going to be strips of steak but it's the actual full New York steak on a sandwich with tomato and onions. \nSome of my favorites are the Mac and Cheese, definitely not your typical Mac and cheese. It has truffle oil and it is just delicious! I also like almost all of their burgers, I've yet to try their late night truffle burger (you can tell I'm a sucker for truffle lol). I also really love their grilled cheese and tomato bisque. The bisque has a nice basil flavor and I always add bacon to the grilled cheese, because well, everything's better with bacon right? For appetizers I love the nachos. It's a really big portion though, maybe too big for only two people. I also really like the lobster, crab, and artichoke dip. \nFor drinks, I usually get one of their martinis or specialty drinks and I've yet to be disappointed!  Overall I love this place and will definitely be coming to the linq location more often!"

Without thinking twice he suggested the ginger crusted salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes.  I started my meal out with a small salad which was a good size and had an array of vegetables, cheese and some croutons for crunch.  I then moved onto my salmon and was so happy I ordered it.  The salmon had a delicious ginger crust on it and was cooled perfectly.  The wasabi mashed potatoes were good as well but the salmon stole the show!

She has a sulfur allergy, and requested one of the toppings be held from her order; though the waiter Did, in fact, input the order correctly, there was a miscommunication somewhere and the offending ingredient wasn't removed.  She realized it as soon as she bit into it, so not much harm done, but if it were a life or death allergy, this would've been serious.  They remade the sandwich for her, and both our waiter and the manager came by to personally apologize for the incorrect (and in this case, hazardous) order.  Though, of course, we would've preferred the order be correct to start with, we're just glad the situation was rectified.

It's flavor, when seasoned and cooked correctly, can transport you to food nirvana. When cooked like a generic piece of meat picked from a nondescript discount heap, is one of the saddest food experiences imaginable... and Yard House's Lamb Burger falls somewhere closer to that kind of sad experience. \n\nMaybe the executive chefs like bland gamey meat; or maybe the menu designer mistyped Lamb instead of Bland; who knows... the result was a seriously unimaginative experience. It literally just tasted like ground lamb meat between two pieces of bread with a minuscule amount of feta to inadequately create a mediterranean facade.\n\nThe shoestring fries were bomb. \n\nThe beer selection is strong. \n\nThe service was phenomenal."

Their entree's are beyond delicious, their prices are reasonable, their atmosphere is big/mellow/fancy/dimmed/fun, their servers have always been friendly and it's quite welcoming! I love their food, it never seizes to amaze me how delicate their taste is! I've been here with groups of co-workers/colleagues, on dates and not once have I've had a bad experience. Yardhouse also has a bar with lots of beer/wine/alcohol selections so if anyone's curious, it's there.\n\nAnyways, my overall experiences with this restaurant have been phenomenal! Highly suggested-"

They, obviously, have the best beer selection in Las Vegas. The service is fantastic, and I love the fact that people know my name in here. I always sit at the bar...this is where to get the greatest service. Happy hour is the best thing going for this place. Where else can you get a Dog Fish Head 90 minute for less than $5? The food is great, I have never had anything I didn't like."

It's good for any occasion and just about everyone can find something they'd like to eat or drink on the menu.\n\nMy parents were in town and we were exploring the Linq, and we wanted something good that wasn't going to break the bank. I suggested the Yard House and so glad I did!\n\nI had the house IPA, which I really liked, and my parents had a watermelon beer and a tangerine beer, both unusual but good. For dinner, I had carnitas street tacos and my dad had the Baja fish tacos. We both liked the tacos a lot, but I didn't care for the rice on the side. It tasted like overly spicy Rice A Roni. However, my dad liked his. My mom got the lamb burger. She really liked it and said it was one of the best burgers ever. I really like lamb burgers but didn't try it due to the feta.\n\nFor sure I will go back again, to any of their locations. I always have a good time and leave generally happy with the food and service. This is a great restaurant group and hope they keep up the awesome."

We came on a Thursday evening (730-ish) and there was no wait for a table inside (nice!). We were seated and we requested to watch a specific channel (NBA playoffs were on) and they were very accommodating (even changed the channel for us). We placed our appetizer order and got our food fairly quickly. The poke bowl and the garlic noodles from the snack menu were divine!!! We ordered our meal and waited almost an hour... Still no food. The waiter came by and apologized and said he would check on it. Took another 15 minutes for the food to come. Given we were there to watch the playoff game, it really wasn't that big of a deal. The manager came by (very nice) and apologized and said she would give us dessert on the house (awesome!). So we placed our dessert order and waited. Another 30 minutes passed and still no dessert! To sum it up, there was a glitch in the system and the kitchen wasn't receiving orders coming in from our table! Oddly enough, it was only our table that was falling through the cracks in the system (although it was weird that we got our snacks in a timely manner).\n\nThe food was delicious though and the prices were just right (especially for being on the strip). The staff was very nice and did apologize profusely. The manager comped a few more items off our bill in addition to the desserts we ordered. But I can tell you, if it wasn't for the playoff game, I would have raised more of a stink. I guess it worked out... We saw the entire game (yes we were there for three full hours) and we got some other items off our bill comped. Although if I was the manager, I would have comped the entire meal (it's all about customer service) and who knows what will end up on Yelp, right? :)\n\nAs for the food, the onion rings were great, sweet potato fries cooked just right, although a nice aioli sauce would have been a nice accompaniment. Steak sandwich was delish... The dessert looks good, but was a bit disappointing. We ordered the s'mores brownie and the trio. None were impressive so I would probably save room for dessert and head outside for Ghiradelli or Sprinkles."

It was so incredibly thoughtful and smooth, when most restaurants just kind of throw someone new at you and you don't know what's going on.\n\nI told the server that I had a nut allergy and the manager came over.  She double checked my order and said she would alert the kitchen staff so that they could take extra care in making our food to avoid contamination.  THAT is how you are supposed to deal with guests who have severe allergies.  it was so great.  \n\nAlso, as everyone else has mentioned, they have a ton of drinks to chose from.  I, personally, was more taken with the feta cream cheese.  It was delicious and unlike anything I had ever eaten before.  \n\nI definitely recommend this place.  Great service and really good food.

After looking at all my choices I still wanted to try the yard house. \n\nI chose the shrimp rice bowl, kind of simple but when traveling and getting up for early I don't like too many heavy meals. Oh. My. Goodness it was perfect! Also fairly fast. The server was fantastic and very accommodating. I then added a lemon souffl\u00e9 at the end for dessert. Let's just say I left a big tip because my dinner price was much less than expected! \n\nI'd come back."

Unlike other chains this place keeps the prices the same even when on the strip. Justin our server was great, he took the time to give recommendations on beer and other things. We had the mooshoo egg rolls which were good. We also had the shrimp cevice and seared ahi sashimi. It's great they offer options that are not just thrown in a deep fryer. We are locals and we will be back to this Yard House."

The Brussel sprouts were crispy on the outside and perfect inside. We also had the garlic noodles with asparagus, muchrooms, and tufu. It was just the right pre race meal. I've been to this place a few times and never tried the snack meals or appetizers. They were big servings and no main dish needed. Our waitress checked on us multiple times and we weren't there very long. They have excellent customer service especially for being on the strip. Or really close to the strip anyways."

The staff are friendly and attentive and the food is always fresh, hot and delicious. The only complaint I have found is that I have to wait longer for my beers here. Mixed drinks, I understand but to order a beer before appetizers and not get it until my entree on 2 separate occasions is pretty annoying. So, get that aspect together and it would be just as good as all the other locations around the valley."

Gleefully the hostess said yes and guided us to a seat in the middle of the restaurant by a glass wall.  Hey bimbo!  A glass wall is NOT  a window!  I asked again to be seated by a window and she said they were all taken.  I asked about the upstairs patio....;.it was closed until six she said.  Okay - It is a BEAUTIFUL day in Vegas in the middle of winter (72 degrees)....OPEN THE PATIO!\n\nSo, we waited and waited at our table.......FINALLY a waitress came and took our order.  We had ample time to look at the menu while waiting, so we gave her our drink and food order.\n\nWaiting, waiting, waiting.....twelve minutes later, we get the wine.  Waiting, waiting, waiting......32 minutes later, we get our food.  We ordered the Korean BBQ and Crab Cakes.  COLD.  COLD. COLD.  \n\nSo disgusted, we just packed it up and left.  \n\nGreat location, terrible staff, terrible service, bad management and cold food.  Don't think I will visit this location again.  So sad because all of the other Yard Houses' I have eaten at were just fine and dandy.  \n\nEat somewhere else on the mall - skip this one."

We have been to the one in San Diego and hoped this place was as good. \nThis Yard House was amazing. A two story restaurant with a huge keg room on the second floor that could handle 145-155/160 different types of beer. All beers are served on tap only. Some domestic beers but most were craft beers from all over the world. Full bar mixed drinks and specialty drinks are available too. \nWe started with a calamari appetizer served with cocktail sauce and tartar sauce. Very tasty. \nThe food was excellent. We ordered the teriyaki chicken with pineapple and a side of fried rice. Chicken was very large portion and flavorful. Fried rice was a little bland but ok. The ginger salmon was extremely large portion. Perfectly prepared and not over cooked or dry. Topped with a string sweet potato fry over a bed of julienne carrots and snow peas. \nAaron our server was excellent. Very attentive and friendly. A definite favorite place when visiting Las Vegas."

Prior to this past Friday the food had always been sub par and the service so-so. \n\nThat all changed when I ordered their chicken nachos and the other three people in my party all had burgers. Everything was absolutely spot on. The nachos were gigante (hee-gaunt-a)! The chicken was super moist, almost like it came from a rotisserie. That's pretty key because the chicken on nachos is usually dry and stringy. Not this time. The red salsa they put on it was really good too. Enough cheese and guac as well as sour cream really led this to be the dish I had been waiting all week for and didn't know it. Super good. Everyones burgers appeared to be solid as well - I think all 4 members of the group were honorary members of the \"Clean Plate Club.\" The service was good enough - dont' recall the servers name, but he kept the drinks full for the most part, gave us enough time to look at their gigantic menu. The only thing that I didn't care for was that I asked him if he could put on the UNLV basketball game. I don't know if it was on TV or not, but he never was able to get the game on and he never mentioned it again. I would have appreciated some sort of acknowledgment - that said, it was crazy busy and I can totally excuse the oversight. \n\nAfter a few bad experiences I'm happy to report out a good one.

What was disappointing was the time it took to get a drink and the food.  We went with the Moo Shu egg rolls for an appetizer.  Those were pretty solid, as usual.  I had the fried chicken sandwich and it was the worst one I've had at any Yard House.  The garlic fries were cold and the chicken sandwich was in 2 pieces!  It was crunchy and way overcooked and I could tell it sat a while before it came out.  Whatever, I ate it.  But it was not very good.  \n\nMaybe it gets busier in here at night or during events but it was sooooo slow when we were in there.  Maybe it's the tucked away location but it was surprising to see a Yard House that wasn't very busy.  I remember when we used to frequent the I-Drive location in Orlando and it was busy from the minute they opened the doors until bar close.  I just assumed the Vegas location would be steady.  \n\nOverall it was below average for a YH.  Might give it another chance next time around."

This seemed like a good location for us to meet....\n\nParking is easy, if you park in the large lot near the High Roller. There was lots of seating, both in the bar and restaurant. We sat at the bar, which was crowded, but not packed (surprisingly crowded on a Wednesday).\n\nThe service was friendly and they (of course) had a lot of beers. I have never really been much of a fan of the selection at Yard House - it's always seemed like more quantity than quality, but it seems they've made some adjustments. There were some local beers available, and I was also able to try a few IPA's I'd never had before.\n\nPrices are high, which is to be expected. I didn't even notice if they offer happy hour like other locations, and we didn't have any food, so I can't comment on that.....\n\nOverall, a good experience and if I am in the area, I will stop by again!"

I happened to be there on the night of St. Patrick's day, and the atmosphere was super fun, especially because of the moveable glass wall panels that opened up the restaurant allowing everyone inside to feel like they were a part of the party happening outside! Our server, Rachel, was great - as was the food. According to the meat eaters in my party, the turkey burgers were out of this world. As a vegetarian foodie myself, I was pleased with the number of vegetarian friendly options. With the super extensive food and drink menus, Yard House seemed like a place that would have an option to please every palate - although if you like lots of different types of food, all the options can be overwhelming, so I would recommend checking out the menu online first to start narrowing down all the choices!"

I just find the food completely underwhelming. \n\nWe started out with the grilled artichoke appetizer, and it was practically raw. It was nearly impossible to scrape the meat off the leaves, and even the heart was tough. This also came with chips and ranch dipping sauce. Kind of an odd combo now that I think of it. \n\nFor my meal I had the pastrami sandwich. It was okay, but I wouldn't go back to order it. The meat was a little tough, and the pickled jalapenos were pretty scarce. It was supposed to be served on a garlic bread, but the bread didn't taste garlicky at all. The fries were probably the best part of this meal. They were thinly cut, and perfectly crispy. \n\nIf this was purely based off the food, I'd give it 2 stars, but the beer menu boosts the rating for me. There's a crazy number of beers on tap, so there's really something for every taste! This is a nice location in the Linq, so if I'm in the area I'll probably stop by for a drink."

The space is huge -- is it the largest YH in the country? -- and the beer list is impressively thorough.  Food is generally well done and satisfies most cravings anyone would have.  I have noticed in the past year that service is hit-or-miss, regardless of which location I've visited.  I frequent the Red Rock Casino location a lot and some days, the servers are fantastic: observant, personable, and very knowledgeable about the menu.  Other times, it's difficult to get the person's attention.  Each time I've dropped by the Linq YH, I've been underwhelmed by my service.  I don't believe that I'm a demanding diner, but I do expect to be acknowledged within 5-10 minutes of being seated and to receive a smile or two.  However, working in the service industry can be trying at the best of times, so I'm willing to give people some slack."

We got a very friendly server of Asian decent (i forgot his name) he was quick to get us drinks and was so nice! We started with jerk chicken wings around $10.00 and got lots of big wings with yummy jerk seasoning and side of jerk bbq sauce and it was amazing. For entree, I got the porcini crusted halibut that comes with Parmesan mashed potatoes and porcini cream sauce with white truffle oil with asparagus and bok Choy. The fish was melt in your mouth delicious. It was so tender but firm and seasoned perfectly. The mashed potatoes accompanied the fish great, so did the asparagus. The bok Choy was ok but I'm not really a huge fan of bok Choy in the first place. It was around $25 and very worth it considering the quality of the food. The portions are pretty on point even though it was sooooo good I wanted it more lol. Boyfriend got the two tacos (you can mix and match two taco combo at a fixed price) he chose the Korean bbq short rib taco and jerk swordfish taco and it came with Mexican rice and refried beans. He loved the Korean bbq taco and the rice. The tacos were pretty small which was the only con through the mean and He didn't really like the fish tacos because it was too bitter and too strong flavored. Overall, it was a great experience and will be back again. I also love how variety the menu is. Everyone can find something they will like at a great price. I love how you can get $10 burgers to $40 steak. Drinks looked great too."

It really kills the ambience when you're just wondering if you'll ever be able to get a fork or if you'll ever be able to order a drink despite that you're sitting at the bar all the while the manager is going around barking at everyone to get everything closed up. I've never been to a place that was so intent on having everything all pulled apart and cleaned up so the staff could leave at the same time as the diners, but the experience was rather unpleasant. I also got the sense that they must mostly deal with drunk jerks, because the attitude of the staff seemed relatively unfriendly and bizarrely condescending, apart from the one bartender guy who seemed to be trying. To be honest, based on my experience working in restaurants while I was in college, I got the impression that this place was hampered by poor management. That said, the service was similarly unfriendly at the Honolulu location so perhaps it's a corporate problem.\n\nI still gave the place 3 stars because the Gardein menu is wonderful, and the food was generally quite good."

The atmosphere is what you would expect at any one of the Yard Houses you visit. \n\nThey have a large selection of beers to choose from and the night we went they also were doing craft cocktails. My friend ordered a whiskey sour which was delicious. \n\nAs far as the food goes, well it's a Yard House. The food is good, but basic. We mostly did appetizers. I think the cheese curds were very good. We also had the moo shu egg rolls. They were ok. The firecracker wings were also pretty good, but nothing spectacular. We had the vampire tacos which others in my party thought were amazing, but I was not impressed. I didn't finish mine. \n\nI'm not saying it was bad...and if I was at home in California it might be somewhere I would eat lunch or go watch the game. In Vegas though you have tons of choices.... a little too average for me. If you are looking for an affordable meal in Vegas though, this place is reasonably priced and it's not bad."

If you ever wanted to become a beer snob, start here. Try them all. Beyond the brews the menu is LARGE and covers salads, snacks, sammies, steaks, desserts, gluten free, etc.. It's like the menu at a NYC diner, only with some class (and fresh((er)) food). There's a sweet patio, a 2nd floor and even a take-out drink spot, in case the shite beers at O'Sheas aren't your cup of tea. With big TV's around and a HUGE center bar, it's a comfy spot to hang and watch a game. Two thumbs up from this guy for YH!"

I also got the French Onion Soup and a Blackened Swordfish taco with no pico de gallo Vampire Style. The French Onion soup is the best ive ever had as well. Nice hearty broth with the crouton on top still fresh and crispy with nicely melted/crisped cheese. Every bit of it was delicious but i did get a bit too much of a spice on the taco since i have a very sensitive tummy, had to make that note for my plain palate peeps! My boyfriend had the Poke Stack and just inhaled it because it was so tasty. The raw marinated fish was very tender and seasoned spot on. Was plated beautifully as well! \n\nWe also had a few special drinks, i really really really enjoyed the Pineapple Express! It was the perfect balance of sweet and tang with the pineapple, combining it with the mint just made it so fresh and light. Made my boyfriend wish he would have ordered my drink, it was so good! He has ordered the Hawaiian Sunset martini and it was good but not my favorite. Had undertones of what reminded me of a fruity vitamin or a gummy worm lol. All in all it was really delicious and worth every penny. We left very happy customers!"

I like medium well, so it was cooked to perfection. I honestly think this is the first place we should have ate, instead of the last. Definitely worth going too, if you're in town. My party that I was with also enjoyed their food, and we all left more than satisfied with our Bellies full. Service was on point, as thy kept the water coming(which was necessary) and we didn't have to keep calling for them, As we were constantly being checked on. I recommend"

My girlfriend ordered a pastrami dip and tomato bisque soup and sandwich I had the turkey club with French onion. The sandwiches were ample for a half sandwich special and very tasty. The avocado in the turkey club was a nice addition and the meat was ample. The French onion soup was covered with bread and cheesed sufficiently, not overly salty that can happen with French onion. The Pastrami was plentiful and the dark dipping sauce added a nice flavor. The Tomato bisque also had a nice texture and taste as well. The abundant draft choice drew me in but the food was a pleasant surprise. Compare restaurants in a similar price range and this one should rate highly. In fact we also ate at Carnegies Deli and paid more for a less impressive sandwich. Don't hesitate to try the food here. Will definitely come back here to try all of the beers."

If you haven't been to one before, it's a great place to have a drink and watch a game.  As a bonus, they have really good food as well.  The staple of most Yard House restaurants seems to be a large bar in the center of the restaurant, with what appears to be a zillion beers on tap.  \n\nMost Yard House locations are huge, and this one is no exception.  My wife and I decided to come here on a weekday for lunch since she had some gift cards.  The restaurant wasn't too busy, but more and more people seemed to be coming in throughout our meal.  They have a big menu, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding something you want.  They have anything from a burger to a steak or nice piece of fish.  I ordered a BBQ Chicken Pizza, while my wife ordered a fancy version of mac-n-cheese.  We both agreed that our meals were very good, and that we would definitely come here again.  We received good service throughout our meal, despite our server taking a break and passing us to a different server for part of our meal.\n\nI know there are a lot of choices when it comes to eating out in Vegas, but don't hesitate to give Yard House a shot if you're looking for a casual, more affordable meal."

We got here a little after opening on a Tuesday and were given the choice of indoor seating or outdoors either on their downstairs covered patio or uncovered patio upstairs. We almost chose the covered patio but the tables there looked better suited for having drinks rather than full meals. Sitting upstairs was out of the question since it was over 100 degrees that day! So inside we sat which was fine as most of their seating is booth seating, which I prefer. Very spacious booths at that :)\n\nOur server if I recall correctly was Rosa. She provided awesome customer service - friendly, courteous, and attentive. I got my usual - small (but filling) portion of Mac and cheese without chicken. Delicious! I had a couple bites of my dining companion's ahi tuna salad and it was quite good! We had to end our meal with their salted caramel butterscotch pudding. It's soooo good we each got our own this time. Very reminiscent of the shakes at Gordon Ramsay Burgr which are topped with the most delicious butterscotch pudding.\n\nExcellent meal, awesome service, comfy booth seating, nice ambiance - quiet since it was just after opening on a Tuesday but plenty to keep myself entertained. They've got plenty of tv's of course, and we were seated by windows looking out to The Linq so there was people-watching for my entertainment. I really like the layout of this location too - booth seating surrounding a long bar in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nTo sum it up, Yard House, you're (more than) all right with me :)"

No wait on a Tuesday night!\nService was attentive, waters were never empty, and our main courses were quick to reach the table. I ordered the usual Mac & cheese. The full size portion was too much for me though since I tried some of my sis' roasted turkey Cobb salad with delicious ranch dressing. Dad's halibut was satisfactory; it came with asparagus, bok choy, and mashed potatoes underneath everything. Mom's two baja fried fish tacos with sriracha were to her liking and I'm surprised at how large the side classic ranch salad is. \n\nGood thing we didn't dine here on a weekend otherwise it would've been packed with possibly a 45 minute wait.

I called Yardhouse feeling somewhat defeated and the gentleman asked how far away I was and when I responded he quickly put me on the call ahead list and said to go ahead and check in when we arrived. I was greeted by many pleasant hosts and was sat with my party right away. Our server took great care of us. We ordered Moscow Mules, beer flights, queso, salads, steak, Parmesan crusted chicken and orange chicken. The items were all delicious! Everything was served in great time and full of flavor. We were very happy with the service, drinks and food and even as locals it was worth the drive to visit this Yardhouse on the Strip."

Very nice. She brought me extra pita chips for my hummus. Definitely better service than the town square location.\n\nIt's a cool chain.

It's the 4th year in a row for me staying at the Flamingo for a trade show I go to every year and it's my 3rd year in a row coming into this Yardhouse for a meal.  I love the location of the Yardhouse at the end of the Linc street mall.  You can wait for a table here but I have either come in slightly off of peak or eaten at the bar.  They have a superior beer and cocktail selection.  They have TVs everywhere tuned to different games. They have a great menu with good options for carnivores to vegans.  They have nice entrees (had the salmon this time) lots of burger and sandwich selections (had those in the past) and plenty of appetizers to choose from.  Did I mention they have great beer and cocktails and TVs with sports on everywhere??!  Prices are typical, service is solid and value is delivered.  Want a sports bar ... there are two in this area, Yardhouse and Tilted Kilt, and I give the nod to Yardhouse for the food and drink.  I think my hotel location will change for the trade show visit I make every year...  If so, it wont be in this area ...but I may still find myself on the Linc street mall and in the Yardhouse one night.  Thanks for being so reliable Yardhouse.  See you soon."

There was a small wait but my wife and I opted to sit at the bar. The bar staff is extremely knowledgeable of the beers which is quite impressive given the variety. I ended up getting a dogfish head 90 minute (a terrific IPA) and my wife ordered a mojito, which was made perfectly. \n\nNow to the food. We started with the Lobster Spinach dip and it was ok. Nothing bad, but I didnt completely love the flavor... but afterwards, I still cannot get over how amazing the Mac n Chz squared is! A mouthwatering portion of applewood smoked bacon, chicken and mushrooms cooked together beautifully makes me never want kraft ever again. I will definitely be faced with a difficult decision when I come back whether to try something else or indulge in this masterpiece again. All around great dining experience. The room is a little loud and kind of difficult to keep a conversation, but the service was great, food was spectacular, and cant beat the beer selection. Also being right next to the highroller was ideal as we rode it after dinner."

I had a half turkey club sandwich and a cup of French onion soup.  (Chris D. don't go out of your way for this soup).  The club was huge even for one half, but the soup was lacking flavor, and topped with a soggy piece of wonder bread.  My husband got the chicken avocado sandwich with truffle fries.  He was quite happy with his meal.  The bloody Mary's that we both had were amazing.\n\nWe came back the next day for a pre concert dinner.  We had the chicken egg rolls with a spicy peanut dipping sauce, and I had to go for my favorite ahi crunchy salad.  It was as good as ever.  That is one thing I like about Yard House, it is usually very consistent.  \n\nOur servers were very attentive, and well trained.  If I only had one thing to offer, it would be to kill the speakers on the outside patio.  The music from YH competes with the music coming from the Linq entertainment center. It can be very annoying to constantly be hearing two songs playing at the same time."

We let them know how many and a host(in training I think) led us to our table. On the way he let us know about their very special location. For instance The Linq location is the largest Yard House location in the company! AND the only 2 story location. I've been to a few different Yard Houses and always marvel at the room next to the entrance FULL of beautiful kegs. Well this location does it waaaaay better. The kegs are above the bar! The layout is simply beautiful! \n\nAfter we were seated our AMAZING server James came and said hi. We knew we wanted to try some beer but had no idea which kind. We told him we needed more time. After he left we needed to get the kiddos situated(I have a very energetic 2 year old) and when he came back we still weren't ready(our fault!) he was SUPER patient. We decided on a watermelon beer and a tangerine beer(this ones better.) we stared with shrimp ceviche and shrimp lettuce wraps and both were tasty. I love the sauces with the lettuce wraps!! For the main courses hubby had the surf and turf burger while I had my go to Mac n cheese, large so I could have leftovers lol. I never had seen their kids menu and it's pretty impressive lots of mains, lots of sides, comes with a drink and choice of dessert. Choices! My kids shared the pizza with edamame as the side and fresh fruit for dessert. Everything put on our table was fantastic \n\nNow back to the service. As a yelper in the food service industry I tend to nit pick over service. I never make a fuss to anyone save my husband.  And presumably we eat out....too much. Service is rarely great, let alone damn near flawless. So when I enter a chain restaurant I don't have high expectations.

The gardein did not have that processed taste. The sauce was flavorful. I also had the spicy edamame and mixed greens. I would reccommend trying if you like orange peel chicken but do not eat meat like me."

Yard House did a great job seating our large group together and bringing our food out at the same time, which is not easy with a big group!\nMy husband and I shared the duck fat potatoes. Oh man, I am still thinking about how good they were! Crispy, salty, savory slices of potato with two dip options - one creamy, one ketchup-based. This is not to be missed!\nFor drinks I had a refreshing pineapple cider and my husband had an IPA sampler.\nFor dinner I had the summer salad and he had tacos.\nThe future bride and groom in our group were given a free dessert that said \"congrats\" on the plate, which was really sweet of Yard House.\nI highly recommend checking out Yard House if you're near the LINQ!"

The staff here are well trained and greets you at the door and say good-bye to you when you leave. Even the young man who sat us at our tables started a conversation about our trip to Vegas. Our waitress, Kristen P was the nicest waitress on this trip to Vegas and I overheard her talking to the folks at the table next to us about being a transplant from the East Coast.  \n\nIt's a very good place for beer lovers - with over a 100 variety, she told us they have up to 300 varieties.  I liked the fried calamari which was crispy, good amt. tentacles and not too oily, $11.25.  The Youngs Chocolate Stout had a delightful chocolate scent.  Hubby thought his small Jambalaya, $12.95 was good. I thought the Nashville boneless Hot fried chicken $16.65 was OK but not sure I'd try it again.  I have a preference for buttermilk fried chicken.  The entire meal with tip came to $62+.  They treat you well here as a customer and that alone would bring me back in the future to try other courses.  There are lots of TVs mounted on the walls to watch your favorite teams."

I had a great time there so when I saw that there are Yard House locations here (Linq and Red Rock, maybe somewhere else as well?) the beer enthusiast within got excited!\n\nTheir beer list is ridiculously extensive and organized pretty much every way you can organize them. Our server seemed pretty knowledgeable about the beers and was really helpful when I was searching for a particular beer. They didn't have the beer but she was willing to bring me a sample of another beer and search for a comparable beer. Keep that in mind when visiting Yard House, don't be afraid to ask for a sample. \n\nTheir food list is also extensive and if I could describe it - I would say it is a fusion of many foods. I ended up going with a burger because we were headed to a show... but the burger was GOOD and huge and a very good price! For the strip, I'd say this is probably some of the lowest pricing for the types of food offered. It's no fancy place but they have plenty of TVs, seating, windows with views of the Linq Promenade and High Roller, and friendly servers (service) to go and enjoy yourself and fill your belly."

Yardhouse at the Linq does not have a happy hour, I'm not sure if they have a reverse happy hour but didn't notice it on the menu.  The Pros: they have more beers on tap and the \"blackboard specials\" this is where we tried the Pugachev's cobra...man that was good stuff..strong, but good, one glass did the job.  Although there isn't any happy hour, there is plenty of seating, inside/outside/upstairs. This is listed as the world's largest Yardhouse.  I've been to this Yardhouse for dinner twice now, both on Friday nights and there was never a wait.  I've been to the Townsquare location and there has always been a wait.  Another con is the parking, of course I wouldn't recommend going to this Yardhouse unless you were already on the strip or planning to hang out at the Linq/Strip.  Having a group try to meet up on a Friday night on the strip was a hassle, I guess this would've been about the same if you were looking for parking at Townsquare also though.  Overall, I love Yardhouse! Great menu options for everyone, appetizers, small bites, vegan and vegetarian options available for all! *great for people watching and close to the High Roller"

Anywhere...\n.\nWe were sat almost immediately, and introduced to George, our server for the night. I believe we may have gotten the last table, at the time, but the staff was on task. Quick with waters and menus. Made some pleasant small talk with George, and a beer sampler arrived, confirming our choice for the first half yard. Well played, George...\n.\nDecided on Wisconsin cheese curds (deep fried, of course), a few tacos, and an absolutely epic turkey pot pie! The cheese curds could be a meal by themselves. The turkey pot pie could be 3!\n.\nWish we could stay in town longer, to try some of the other offerings... If our small sampling tonight is any indication of the overall quality, then it's impossible to go wrong. From the extensive beer list, to the quality ingredients, piping hot entrees, to the excellent wait staff, this visit was a total win.\n.\nKeep up the good work guys. You are doing it right.

Again, no surprises; food was as represented.\nI suggest the skirt steak salad or the ahi tuna sandwich.  Both were great.\nThe wine list was thorough, but not huge.

I ended up here to have late night dinner after drinking and walking around with friends. Anyways their menu has a huge selection and I went in for the \"late night menu\" starts from 10pm till 2. To start as an appetizer I ordered onion ring tower (these were soo good you must try them!) for my entree I ordered the Black truffle cheeseburger (7.95) medium well, & it was delicious! Super flavorful meat well seasoned and juicy! \nAlong with that I ordered a side of truffle fries (4.25) the fries I'll give it 3 stars it was too salty! :( other than that everything else was bomb.

            "review": "Yard House has always been one of those staple restaurants that's been around for years and have maintained a consistency with the food they serve. \n\nThis YH is located along the walkway at the Linq and has an express bar outside that allows you to order your alcoholic beverage and enjoy the night without having to be a patron inside the restaurant. \n\nWe showed up and was told that there was a 35 minute wait. We decided to walk to the bar in hopes to find an open stool.  We were wrong, it was jammed pack. Fortunately, our number was called before the given time and was lead into the bar/patio part. \n\nIt took a great while before we received any type of service. By the time our waiter served us, we had already picked out everything that we wanted. And once he came by, we placed our entire order. For starters, we chose the calamari and fries. Chris ordered the sear ahi tuna with brown rice and I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with organic tomato soup.  The food took an even greater while. We were very annoyed and at that point, wanted to walk off the premise. It was obvious that the food runner was running to drop off meals to other tables as he was sweating quit a bit when he got to our table. YH is obviously lacking the correct number of staff to the amount of people that dines inside. \n\nThe annoying part is the appetizers were given simultaneously with our meal!! Really YH? You've been serving food for so long and for your staff to give us food like that is a complete let down. Especially for an established chain restaurant with standards. The food as usual, was good but we were not impressed with their calamari. Number one, it was cold. The breading was not crunchy and was coming off the calamari. This is an easily passable order. The fries were good and flavorful. Our meals were good and we enjoyed it.\n\nBut the food just wasn't as enjoyable as it usually does due to their lack of service, staff, and coordination. The fact that they served the meal and the appetizer at the same time, is a big no-no. The waiter did offered to \"keep it warm\" while we ate the appetizers but seeing how slow their service was, we decided against it. \n\nYH is in a great spot and we hope they improve on their quality of service."

Good food, good beer, and great prices. Although this is a chain restaurant, it's one of the better ones. And this location should be on the top of their national list.\n\nOur friend Betty was visiting from Texas, and we all took a ride on the High Roller. (Great deal if you get a pre-6 p.m. rate w/drink on Living Social.) Next up was happy hour at the Yard House, in the shadow of the mighty Roller. They have drink specials and half-price appetizers from 3 to 6. Timing was great (although I planned this attack in advance, because I knew what they had to offer...).\n\nWe split three apps -- Hawaiian poke stack, spinach cheese dip, and pepperoni & mushroom pizza -- and we each had a few craft beers (mostly white ales and IPAs). Food was good -- not great -- but you can't beat that quality at half-price. And if you like beer and can't find one you like on this extensive menu, that's on you. (They offer samples in case you're curious, but don't treat it as a free for all, or we'll all suffer!)\n\nI have to mention the exceptional service we had. We sat on the upper patio amid a shift change, which could have been disastrous. Instead, we had three waitresses who were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about their menu -- which, sadly, should be a prerequisite to being a server but usually isn't. Kudos to the staff here!\n\nI've been to other Yard House restaurants, but this has to be my favorite. What a fantastic location! And while it can be pricey during \"normal\" hours, the happy-hour rate is hard to beat. Overall, I can't think of a better place for happy hour on the Strip than the Yard House. (If you know of something better, let me know!)"

I and the fish tacos which would have been good if they weren't so overwhelmingly breaded and fried. The taste of the fried breading over powered the fish and made an otherwise healthy dish less so.  The rice and the beans that came with them did not taste good and should be reworked.  Our recent visit was 3 stars for an average of 4."

The customer and employee relationship that starts, as soon as you are seated, is absolutely phenomenal! This Yardhouse at the LINQ is a must visit! The unique parts of this restaurant are the floating kegs on the second floor, Most but not all employees in here is your friend and EAGER to make your first and every experience the best you've ever had. I never feel hesitant to speak to an employee for specific concerns or needs in food on the menu. Whether it is having an allergy to an ingredient or just simply not liking a particular part of the food you want to order. These employees are very willing to make you a happy customer by always going out of their way to accommodate you!  One advice I can leave you with is, be patient with this location for another year because they are fairly new, if some employees don't give superb customer service, the right information, or don't know every question, you could let a restaurant manager know to train them better. Communication is what makes the world go round! It solves many issues or concerns. I would love mention specific employees who give BEYOND excellent service each time, Martin, Jason, Ryan, and Sky."

I was pleased with the street tacos and maybe having a sampling of the appetizers with your beers is the way to go.\n\nThe beer is what I come to Yard House for and I was satisfied with my tasty lineup of four pints of darks: Brooklyn Brown, Anderson Valley Wild Turkey Stout, Deschutes Black Butte, and the Boulder Nitro Shake Chocolate Porter. If you like bourbon and stout, the Wild Turkey stout is an interesting combo that I've never had.\n\nThere have been no complaints with service on any of our visits. Expect a price point of $$ to $$$ depending on how much you drink. There's no doubt I'll be back if hanging out around the LINQ."

You can come here for legit late night food and decent priced drinks...\n\nEven if they don't have a happy hour menu like other their restaurants, they do have a Black Truffle Cheeseburger that is amazing when paired with the truffle friends all for about $10. Also, having to pay $7 for a shot of Hennessy is a diamond in the rough compared to these other clubs and bars that charge anywhere between $10-$17 for a shot. \n\nIf you're in the mood for some normalcy in Vegas at a decent price, this yard house will hit the spot. Also the Linq alley is a very nice place to just stroll, shop, eat, and drink. Highly recommend coming to see the glamorous Ferris wheel here!!"

Once we were seated at the bar, my husband was asking the bartender questions about the beers on tap. It was at this point the bartender advised me that I couldn't have my drink. I had to \"chug it or take it outside\"! Rude. Yardhouse won't see ANY of my money. I know the bartender is just the messenger but this is a STUPID POLICY.

We took an elevator to get to the top floor and passed by the outdoor patio and peep-through kitchen.  Our server Ron was sweet and attentive.

My favorites were the moscow mule and the sparkling raspberry cocktail made with my favorite beer: framboise.\n\nWe enjoyed it so much that not only did we eat there a second time on our trip, we have decided to make it a tradition on all of our Vegas trips from then on.

The 32 year old had salad and Mac and cheese which she said \"was to die for\"...it was creamy and had truffle oil? She loved it. We old folks...well he had the pepper crusted filet and salad. He was very content..he didn't rave but he said was flavorful. It came with masked potatoes, asparagus and a house gravy that was good. He wasn't blown away but felt he got his money's worth. I had the southern fried chicken breast..it came with mash potatoes, BBQ beans, cream corn and gravy. Mine was off the chain. Delicious.\nApparently they have an enormous beer menu..we did not partake but daughter says it was impressive list.\nThe only real cons: LOUD..not just the music it's the clanging of dishes, scooting chairs...TVs it was not a place to try and have a conversation. Lol\nService was a wee slow but seems that was a common theme in Vegas this particular week.\nI Highly recommend this restaurant for the food and it does have a lively atmosphere and a great view of the Linq and High Roller.\nIt's a short walk down the Linq from Las Vegas Blvd."

Mostly because it was the only place open and decent enough to eat at.\n\nIt wasn't very crowded, probably because it was later in the evening, so service was quick and attentive. My favorite thing about the Yard House is their extensive vegan/vegetarian section. Compared to most places that either leave you with just a house salad or some shitty microwaved Boca burger, the Yard House actually uses some tasty meat substitute and incorporates it into their existing dishes. \n\nThe selection is vast, anything from pizzas, orange chick'n, and penne pasta with chik'n. (chik'n as in not real chicken, not as in I can't spell mmk)\nThis is one of the main reasons I even agreed to give this place another shot, most places don't give a shit about vegans/vegetarians/or anyone with food restrictions and it's one of the few places I've been to that have had a wide variety of vegetarian options without actually being a named vegetarian restaurant. \n\nAnd what is a Las Vegas restaurant without a vast selection of beers to choose from?\nMy favorite mix to get is the Black Velvet, because if you don't like Guinness you're wrong. But if you don't, worry not, there are many selections of dark, red, brown, pale, ciders, and other beers to choose from, as well as an extensive wine list, and of course, spirits for the super lonely.\n\nPrices are relatively the same here as their other locations, reasonable but not exactly under the definition of cheap.\n\nThe service was great here, and I hope it's a trend at this location, I definately want to come back more often."

We ordered a grilled artichoke, truffle fries, flatbread, egg rolls, and turkey burger sliders. The truffle fries were fabulous, and when they say shoestring fries, think baby shoelaces because that's how thin they are.  The turkey burger sliders were good, and the egg rolls never disappoint. The other two items however, yuck.  The grilled artichoke was not cooked long enough, so it was tough pulling leaves off. The flatbread was the dough itself, cheese, and some veggies. It was dry and tasteless...no sauce or anything on it. At least throw some garlic oil on it maybe? Our server called the manager over and he did handle the situation by taking the flatbread and artichoke off the bill.  Overall, I'd definitely come back here for their vast selection of beer, but sorry Yardhouse, your food has disappointed me one too many times."

The menu is long and broad: from jambalaya to pizza you'll never leave hungry. The menu is so long that it does take quite some time to decide. The portions are huge. The food isn't the greatest however it matches the atmosphere. I definitely recommend giving this a try!"

The description in the menu sounded better than it tasted.  It was not bad but kudos to whoever writes the copy for the menu.\n\nThe menu is varied and when I'm in Vegas again, I will probably go back and try something else."

Turns out they serve a darn good Bloody Mary and the perfect high-carb hangover cure: Mac & Cheese.  The menu says it's a customer favorite, and I completely believe. The small portion seemed like a sensible idea, but I was honestly a little sorry I hadn't indulged in a stuff fest.  My companion enjoyed her chicken tortilla and fish tacos, too. It's a restaurant chain, but a good one!"

The buffalo \"chicken\" tenders were amazing and I enjoyed the chopped salad with the bloody mary vinaigrette. I love salads that have an equal ratio of vegetables - including lettuce.\n\nThe service was great as well. One weird thing: they ask everyone that comes in if they have been there before. If you say no then there is just a welcome, the same as if you had said yes. You expect something \"special\" after a question like that so it is very awkward. We sat near the door so witnessed it over and over."

Food was excellent, we had one waiter (Christian) who gave exceptional service. His fellow coworkers (which they all help each other out was also great). Definitely returning back to this Yardhouse when we come back to Las Vegas."

            "review": "Now, this is a chain and we typically avoid chains when we are visiting somewhere new. That said, Vegas can get exhausting and going to a place like this was just the break we needed. It's on this little \"strip off of the strip\" area behind the Linq which has some other nice places (check out my review of Sprinkles). I loved this little area because it was much calmer than the main strip but still active. Apparently it is just out of the way enough that the obnoxious drunks wander past.\n\nWe had the grilled cheese and tomato bisque combo and the street tacos.  All of the street tacos are great. Very fresh and light and they hit the spot. My girlfriend was making a face while she ate the grilled cheese that I wish she made when we did \"other things\" together. Moving on...\n\nWe sat at the bar which we tend to do in most places. If you're visiting Vegas or anywhere that is busy, make sure you check the bar if you have a small party (no kids). We skipped a pretty big line by going to the bar here and the same thing at the Hash House a Go Go.  You also have your server right there whenever you need something. In the case of the Yard House, we had three very attentive and pleasant bartenders that took great care of us. \n\nThe beer list is expansive, great atmosphere which is just \"clubby\" enough to keep the Vegas momentum but it wasn't annoying.  All in all, a good choice."

Specifically, the spicy tuna roll and the vampire tacos were out of this world. \n\nI have only eaten at the bar, but the service was incredibly fast. Would definitely recommend YH for drinks or for dinner, great on both fronts."

Can't choose who is better at this time considering the food was delicious at both places. I like the ambiance/decor at this location better than the one in town square though. Both locations have their own great qualities as for as accessibility and entertainment. I guess it all comes down to service. The hostesses at this location are obnoxiously bitchie and arrogant. Never had a problem with the staff at the town square location. Other than that, this Yard House is great and I recommend stopping by!"

However, it wasn't as flavorful and exciting as expected. It ended up being our most expensive dinner in Vegas with only ordering one burger, one sandwich, and a pint of pineapple cider. The price doesn't quite match quality. Biggest plus was the garlic fries (shoestring) and cider, otherwise it was okay. Our server James was very nice."

It was a beautiful day and we were seated on their amazing rooftop patio.  We ordered some ciders (PINEAPPLE cider!), and a few appetizers to share.  We got the Moo Shu Egg Rolls, Hawaiian Poke Stack and Coconut Shrimp.  Everything was super fresh and tasty.  We had never been to a Yard House before and this is definitely not our last time.  We were actually wishing we had just a little more time in Vegas so we could go back for one more meal.  There were so many tasty sounding things on the menu, it was hard to decide."

I requested a \"chicken sandwich\" with the gardein protein sans cheese.  When it arrived it had cheese and mayo.  I told the waiter, and he was deeply apologetic.  A few minutes later, the manager came up to me and said the meal would be on the house.  Now THAT is customer service!  \n\nAs you probably know, their beer selection rocks and the ambiance is fun and friendly.  All the bartenders had something to chat about and were genuinely knowledgeable about beer.  \n\nLove it!"
