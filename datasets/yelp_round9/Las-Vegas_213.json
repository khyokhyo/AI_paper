They are very informative with how to order and explain that all the fruit they use is fresh. Their ice cream is also much lower in calories than your typical ice cream or so they claim. I tried the green grape and strawberry ice cream and the taste blew me out of this world! The taste was very fresh and I was surprised how good it tasted! I never imagined whole milk and fruit ice cream can taste so light! I definitely want to try making that myself! I recommend trying their fruit flavors here because they use fresh fruit. I sampled my friends ice cream that we're all just milked base (aka coconut, peanut butter chocolate) and they were just ok. I think what makes this joint stand out are their fruit flavors. Must try!"

But this is no ordinary ice cream place, here they make the ice cream fresh right in front of you, with no nitro to be seen. \n\nI chose red bean ice cream made from soy milk and mochi topping. They gave me extra mochi, too!\n\n I loved that they put on a little show while making your dessert. Don't go without expecting at least 3 high fives from the owners."

I came for the show (and cream) and it was pretty amazing, I've never seen ice cream be made this way! The guys who were working were super friendly and talented; it seemed like they were born to do this? I don't know how to say it, they just make it look so effortless. They gave us a brochure about the health benefits of their ice cream and that they contain a lot of natural soy products. (if you are not used to soy, it will make you go poopy) Overall it was fun, and tasted good."

            "review": "So, first things first...the ice cream is amazing. The idea that I can pick out my own milk/cream to be used to make the ice cream is very cool. In fact, as someone who can't handle too much sweet or rich food all at once...being able to pick low fat milk as my ice cream base resulted in me actually for the first time ever being able to finish my entire cup of ice cream. This is nice compared to my standard operating procedure at places like Cold Stone where I get the smallest size possible, then finish about 25% of it due to fat/sugar exhaustion. \n\nThat all being said, what pushes this place into AWESOME territory is the owner and staff. The owner exudes a sense of excitement about what he's doing that's beyond contagious. Upon ordering, my wife and I received high fives commending our ice cream creations being good choices. He also made it a point to offer to re-make for free anything we didn't like. The laughter, smiling, dancing and general cheer that came from the three people working there was just absolutely infectious. The kicker here, is that it all seemed so genuine. I've been to many places that force employees to be cheery, and I usually tend to see straight through it as an act...but in this case the exact opposite is true. \n\nThe cherry on top of this experience is that when my wife and I were enjoying our ice cream, the owner saw that my mother in law didn't order anything...and promptly brought her over and gave her a free banana popsicle that he had just made in the back. So cool. There is a reason that so many reviews mention the owner...he's got that rare ability to inspire happiness. Hell, I think I'd pay money to go here and just talk to the guy for a few minutes when I'm having a bad day. \n\nGo here...this is the type of place that deserves to do great."

Only three fruits are included. It's literally a bowl of crushed ice with some pink-colored fruit syrup. I brought it back and requested the whipped cream that's shown in the picture, but it wasn't much of an improvement.\n\nGo for a $6+ ice cream creation to watch a Slap-Chop commercial in action on an anti-griddle, if you don't lose your sweet tooth after reading the pamphlet on the counter about the sea vegetables and all-natural laxative included as ice cream ingredients. \n\nThis review has been brought to via mobile publishing on the Yelp app."

            "review": "Being a first timer here I was amazed by the people making the ice cream. It was cool watching your ice cream being made from fresh fruits. \n\nI ordered mango and pineapple, after waiting about 5 minutes my order was up. One of the ice cream server poured my liquid blended fruit onto the pan. From there he began the process of mixing the blend and each time he would mix it by chopping, flipping and slapping the \"putty knife\"? The liquid blend started to look more like an ice cream. Once it was done he scooped it up and put it into our cups. I wish it was like the videos I've seen online where they put it into a roll instead of a scoop like regular ice cream. \n\nNow for the taste review. I got mango and pineapple. The fact it was real blended fruit the texture was pretty slimy but that's just me. I never had freshly blended fruit ice cream so it's definitely not the same as regular ice cream. I tasted the mango which was sweet but the sourness of the pineapple was there also which almost killed my mood just a bit. I was craving the sweet more so the pineapple was a thumbs down for me. The pineapple must have not been ripe or I had the bitter end. \n\nOverall the place was nice and entertaining somewhat. Just watching a couple guys make ice cream chopping, slapping, and flipping the ice cream being made was interesting but YouTube made it more interesting in Asia where I've seen it before coming here. \n\nI recommend this place if you haven't seen anything like this. Stuffs you up with fresh fruit I've cream."

Everything is fresh and natural, made to order right in front of your face, and they feature different and interesting seasonal flavors you won't be able to find anywhere else. I tried their green grape icecream today and not only was it made quickly and skillfully, but also service with a smile. Everything looks clean, fresh and welcoming. Great place. I hope i get to see more of these popping up everywhere. Specially in California. I don't like going inside Harrah's, but I do only to visit this location."

I'm from California and NOBODY has ever been this great to me!!\n\nI was staying at Harrah's from december 28 to the 30th and I had to crave ice cream in 30 degree weather. I was at the Venetian shopping with my boyfriend when my mom called me that she and this other family that accompanied us were eating ice cream at a shop in Harrah''s. So my boy and I rushed over and there, we were introduced to Ice Pan. Ice pan is basically a \"create-your-own ice cream\" concept owned by friendly and adorable Koreans. \n\nI ordered green tea flavored ice cream with soy milk and cheesecake bits, but changed to strawberry toppings in the end. It was so healthy and tasty which I love! The owner who took my order was great and high-fived me whenever he thought I made an excellent choice. \n\nThe ice cream creator who upfront made my order together was done within 5 minutes and offered it to me with a friendly smile. Aw thanks!\n\nThe cool part is that the owner seemed to have his own private popsicle stand in the employee room and would call my family over SEVERAL TIMES FOR FREE POPSICLES. I wasn't able to get one since I was still working on my ice cream, but flavors range from fruity to green tea.\n\nThis place put a smile on my face after an exhausting day in Vegas. I applaud them for their energy! Thank you! I will definitely be back!"

Choose your choice of dairy or non-dairy milk, fruit, candy and vegan flavors. It was surprisingly not very sweet, which I love, but completely refreshing. I got the peanut butter with low-fat milk and Reese's. Sweetened with a natural sweetener that acts as a laxative, you gently go poo in the morning and clean out your intestines! What more could you ask for in an ice cream? Only open until the end of August, they are headed to Cali as their contract is up with Harrah's. It probably will do better in Cali."

Think of Coldstones, but they actually make the ice cream from scratch right on the pan.\n\nStart off by choosing the flavor, ranging from fruits to coffee and mint chip, then the milk type, and any additional add ins. They have whole fat milk all the way down to nonfat and even soymilk, so for those of us trying to watch the fat intake and lactose intolerant, this place is perfect. The owners get only the best fruits and they're always super sweet. The husband actually drove all the way to LA just to buy fresh pomegranates! They'll make suggestions of what add-ins go best with what flavor, and they've never steered me wrong. They owners are also a blast to talk with! \n\nAny travellers looking for a treat, or locals, should definitely give this place a try! It can be a little tricky to find though, it's all the way in the back of Harrah's, by the parking structure entrance, but it's well worth to walk back there."

This place was awesome, I came here with my girlfriend and we shared their pistachio ice cream. The two workers there were both super friendly, chatting as they were working hard to produce the delicious ice cream on the spot. I was quite impressed by the amount of effort they put into making the ice cream.\n\nThe service was excellent as well. The manager was extremely friendly, and even offered us free toppings (along with some of the other guest). She recommended bananas with our pistachio ice cream, which at first sounded rather strange but tasted extremely good! She offered the customer before us oreos and mochi to the one after us, giving what she considers to  be excellent pairings to our flavors (which they were).\n\nI think it's a pity that this place is so hidden and has no signs to direct you to it, but I definitely plan to come back to here the next time I come to Vegas!"

For both service, the ice cream, the fruit, the flavor and whatever related to this ice cream store.\n\nThe owner is hilarious who makes you laugh and enjoy your waiting time. You are required to have at least some high-five and boom! before leaving. Even though he has some accent which is kinda hard to understand but I don't care, i just love this place. I saw he was sweating that meant he put a lot of efforts in order to satisfy the customers.\n\nLet's talk about the food, no sugar, no chemicals, no preservation ... What else do you expect from the ice cream? Delicious and awesome. Let him entertain you and let yourself being entertained. Also have him to serve your ice cream if he's not busy, why? As he said \"the more i'm angry, the more happy you are cuz i will make a better food for you\". He flips and bangs your food like nobody else but believe me, he's right. The more he plays with your food on the pan, the more you will like it.\n\nHow they make the ice cream? You will have to choose your flavor, your milk and your toppings. They make it from scratch that means you will see like how peanut butter can be made into ice cream.\n\nMy recommendation for the ice cream? Try the peanut butter cuz it's the owner's fav. he will make his own flavor for you and you will enjoy it for the rest of the day.\n\nAnd be careful, you will have to pay a bill of nearly 6 million dollar for an ice cream. (that's what he calls for a 6-dollar ice cream) :)\n\nThis place makes my day! I gave it thousand stars instead of five."

They offer about 12 flavors to choose from, your choice of dairy, and a plethora of fresh fruits to choose from to add into the ice pan.  The process is amazing to watch.  It kind of makes you forget the hefty price you paid at  the cash register.  Kind of...it's about $7 for a bowl.  It's delicious though and worth every penny.  In addition, the owner/manager, will make you another one if your primary choice for ice pan isn't to your liking.  What a nice guy!  He's funny, sometimes, too.\n\nI tried the banana with blue berries made from low fat milk and topped with caramel sauce.  I got the thumbs up for my choices from the man himself.  Way to go me!  I also tried the green tea with lychee made with whole milk.  I needed a little help with this one.  I had to ask his recommendation for a fruit to add with green tea.  Boo...booooo to myself.  I liked them both as well as the red bean flavor my brother ordered with mochi.  The employees are cool and nice.  The place looks clean and eye catching.  Next time I'm in Vegas I definitely will stop by again.  One thing though, Ice Pan is cash only.  ATM's are conveniently located downstairs and all around Harrah's."

It was really easy to find from the parking garage in Harrahs - just take elevator to casino and its like a minute walk past the toby keith bar. \n\nWorkers were very nice, but hard to understand at times. I had an incredibly enthusiastic Korean guy helping me. There was a list of suggested combinations on the counter, but he was also full of suggestions. We went with the following: chocolate w mochi and coconut, coffee w chocolate chips, red bean and mochi. All turned out pretty well. \n\nThe end result was kinda sorta like yogurtland all mixed up. But the coffee stood out - the coffee flavor was really strong in a good way. \n\nThey put on a good show mixing up the ice cream, like a really p*ssed off version of benihana. Is it really worth $15 for 2 ice creams? Mmmm I'm not so sure, but it was pretty awesome. Guessing high price was a big factor in why the Cali store didn't make it. With so many other equally delicious but cheaper frozen treats, its hard to compete.\n\nI couldn't find a phone number for them to check when they closed, but according to the Harrahs operator they're open 10am-2am. But don't quote me, I'm not sure they'd be open that late."

He dug around in the back til he found some, then called his boss to make sure it wasn't expired! Thanks for that! So we had red bean with lowfat milk. The ice cream had a yummy flavor, but a grainy texture. I want to try a different flavor next time, as I think the texture could have been partly due to the red bean. We will definitely be back when we have a little more room in our tummies!\n\nOh, PS, they are CASH ONLY!!!"

At first, I was put off with the fact that they are so careful with how much of the mix ins they put in. I watched my ice cream maker count out three raspberries and eight blueberries to add into my mango soy ice cream. For $7, I was starting to feel nickel and dimed. \n\nThis all changed when I got my ice cream. It was rich, naturally sweet (treading too sweet, but never overstepped the line), getting raspberries to balance it out was a good choice. My hater mentality quickly went away while I enjoyed this delicious treat. It is hard to stay mad after seeing how much work goes into making each cup. The scraping, slapping, cutting, smashing, and mixing is tedious work. \n\nThe cashier slashes out the gratuity line on the receipt, so bring a few dollars if you plan to tip.

I enjoyed watching them make the ice cream on the pan and putting in all the toppings, but the price just doesn't justify the product. $7 for a regular with 1 topping! Ahhh if only the flavors were more exotic or creative then maybe... but the flavors were pretty generic - Chocolate, Mint Chocolate Chip, Coffee, Mango, Pineapple, Pina Colada, etc. Not to mention the size... I get that it's Vegas but come on... gotta step up your game if you want to compete with the other ice cream shops out there!\n\nEssentially, you are just paying for the guys to mix your ice cream and freeze it on the pan. It's quite a lot of work for a small amount of ice cream, but I guess the novelty is what attracts people. Overall, I won't be going out of my way for this place again."

Ice Pan is located on the 2nd floor promenade at the Harrah's Las Vegas hotel so unless you know about it and come specifically looking for it I doubt that you will ever run into it.\n\nOrdering seems complex but is very straightforward. You start by selecting the base ($5.95) for your ice-cream which could be whole milk, non-fat milk or soy milk, then select the flavor from Strawberry, Mango, Banana, Kiwi, Green Tea, Vanilla, Chocolate, Yogurt, Coffee, Lemon, Pistachio, Mint Chocolate, Red Bean, Watermelon, Pumpkin, or Pomegranate and finally select the toppings of your choice (50c each) from Strawberry, Banana, Kiwi, Mango, chocolate Chip, Blueberry, Walnut, Pineapple, Almond, Granola, Macadamia, Coconut, Marshmallows, Chocolate Syrup, Caramel, Mochi, Lychee, Fruity Pebbles, and\\or Raspberry.\n\nI decided to try Red Bean as that is a really difficult ice-cream to get right specially considering that Ice Pan claims it has no artificial coloring, no refined sugars, no extra sodium, and no preservatives. The milk and red beans are basically blended together and then dropped on an ice pan which causes it to instantly freeze. This is then followed by softening the frozen ice-cream by scrapping it up and trashing it around using two metal scrapes. After a minute of repeating this softening process toppings are mixed in and finally the ice-cream is scooped into a cup. I went with mochi toppings as it goes well with red beans which was a good choice as they seemed to pair up perfectly.\n\nTaste wise this is the pinnacle of not-too-sweet, but believe me its good. If Ice Pan can get someone like me who likes sweet ice-cream to appreciate the natural inherent taste of red beans then they are definitely doing something right. Service is excellent. The owner is very friendly and approachable and could easily be a role model for others.\n\nLeft completely satisfied so will surely return to try something else the next time I'm in Vegas."

He's super sweet and loves doing what he does, so props to you man. Also, his employees seem to enjoy it too. So, friendly owner, means friendly employees, means friendly service. They're awesome and a great help!\n\nQuality: The ice cream here is like no other. Everything is made fresh. Fresh fruit! You can choose the type of milk you want: soy, low fat, non fat, whole. It's honestly one of the greatest ideas I've seen. It's an ice pan and made in front of your eyes. Definitely worth watching and taking lots of videos! The ice cream is really good texture, if you're a fan of just normal ice cream out of a tub, this isn't for you.

I would be worried if they didn't get any business. But they are thriving! We went late night on a Sunday so it was no wait, but then after we ordered so many people got in line. So it was perfect timing on our part. Personally, I got the lemon with low fat milk and fresh raspberries. It. Was. Delicious. Not to lemon-y like some sorbets. It was fresh. Soft and creamy, yet still had the sorbet type of feel. My friends got pistachio with soy milk and cheesecake, and mango with low fat milk and mochi. The pistachio tasted like real pistachio and the mango made me feel like I was in the Philippines! You can definitely taste the freshness. \n\nOverall, we had a great experience and will definitely be coming back and bringing the friends. It's located inside the Harrah's and definitely another one of Vegas' hidden gems. I was scared seeing all the reviews and not liking it, but boy did it surpass my expectations."

Ice Pan sits inside Harrah's Casino, on the 2nd level Promenade.  But there's no signs for it, so follow the 1st level arrows to Toby Keith's Bar & Grill cuz it's right across from it!  Ya know yur close if yur going up an escalator beside the Fulton Street Food Hall (at street level). Take it up to the 2nd level & look to the left... Found ya!  That's half the battle.  WHAT NOW?!?  Now, ya gotta decide creation options with their 3 step choice process: flavor choice, dairy choice (Yay!  They have SOY MILK!!!), and topping choice.  So we sampled a few things...\n\nWhat's cool is the ice cream is made RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!!!  But there's NO liquid nitrogen here.  To quote, \"Pan Ice is self Freeze-Teppan style ice cream.\"  The teppan (steel grill) is chilled to a arctic -35degrees Celsius.  After the concoction you request is mixed in the back counter, it's dropped on the teppan and after a lil mixy mixy, Poof!  Pan Ice fo' you in minutes!   Takes longer to decide what to put in yur cool treat!  Here, a cold water SEAWEED emulsifier is used for bonding rather than some unpronounceable group of letters.  The sweetness is created by FructoOligoSaccharide (FOS), a natural sugar found in highest concentrations in the blue agave plant, Jerusalem artichoke, and yac\u00f3n (Thanks Wikpedia!).  Our creation choices today were pistachio with almonds (with soy milk), strawberry with strawberries, and vanilla with Oreo cookies.\n\nDespite NO artificial coloring, NO refined sugars, NO extra sodium, and NO preservatives, this treat was YUMMY!

After that, they put into an ICE PAN, and then literally smack it a lot of times and cut it in half. The cool thing is that for the mango ice cream that I had which we got pineapple topping with, they chopped up all the pineapple in the process with the ice cream making and it goes well together.

Once the mix is blended, it is dumped on a super cold and freezing ice pan, scraped, and slapped against the pan to incorporate air until it is the texture of ice cream. \n\nSoy green tea with mochi mix -in - The matcha flavor was deep and the texture was just like ice cream, soft but yet firm and melted in your mouth, but doesn't melt as quickly as froyo. It's not too sweet at all - just lightly sweetened - and no heavy sugar coating on the tongue after it's finished.\n\nRed bean whole milk with mochi and caramel drizzle - the flavor really shined! I find that the red bean flavor often gets lost in a lot of frozen desserts, but you could definitely taste it in Ice Pan's ice cream.\n\nThere was no artificial aftertaste and both options of milk yielded a creamy texture. I think nonfat would yield a creamy texture too - I'll have to try that next time.\n\nYou have the option of adding chocolate of caramel syrup or of course for extra $, additional toppings or whipped cream. I didn't add anything else since the mochi itself would make this dessert sweeter and heavier mind you. \n\nThe staff was great and knowledgeable; the older man who I think is the owner is very passionate about his product and you can see how enthusiastic he is to make it for you.

My friends and I were on our way back to our cars after watching the Mac King Comedy Show at Harrah's when we stumbled across a group of people gathered around this place. Upon checking it out we discovered that it was an ice cream shop where your ice cream is made right in front of you! We ended up giving it a try.\n\nIt was incredible! They have a decent selection of flavors to choose from including strawberry, mango, kiwi, and even mint chocolate. After picking your menu you also get to select whether or not your ice cream will be made out of whole, low fat, non fat, or soy milk. Once you've selected those things you can choose to add as many toppings as you'd like although I wouldn't add more than 3 or 4 as it beings to get pricey after that. When your ice cream is finally prepared you can choose to have it served to you in a cup or a waffle cone.\n\nIt tastes amazing. I ordered the strawberry ice cream made from whole milk with almonds, bananas, and cheesecake bites and it was fantastic. The taste of the ice cream was just so fresh. They blended everything together nicely and even the process of making the ice cream was awesome. I definitely recommend this place to anyone on the strip looking for a healthy and delicious treat."

Came here during my last Vegas trip and after reading some reviews, just had to try it.\n\nGot there around 10ish and there were a couple people waiting for their ice cream to be made. (NOT SCOOPED, I REALLY MEAN MADE)  Eventually ordered the green tea ice cream with mochi.  The cashier seemed to be the owner of the place.  A very nice and cordial Korean man wants the customer to know the benefits and the differences of Ice Pan and almost every other ice cream shop in the nation.  He mentioned that every was all natural.  He even showed me the powder they used to make my green tea ice cream (matcha powder).  He then opened one of the brochures for me to look over while I waited for my ice cream.  \n\nAfter placing my order, one of the 2 ice cream makers started making my ice cream.  They first mixed the powder with the milk and then added it to the anti-griddle.  Adding in a few bits of mochi and then they started mixing.  The cold structure made the liquid turn into the ice cream quickly and the person would start mixing it all around until it became the right consistency.  Ended up with three medium sized scoops with more mochi added on top.\n\nTaking my first bite, the taste of the green tea was very apparent and the consistency was perfect.  It wasn't over-churned (or hand-mixed in this cased) and the mochi was a great accompaniment.\n\nWatching the mixers make the ice cream was a bit drawing point to me.  It felt like everything was fresh and you actually knew what was going into it.\n\nI would definitely come back.  I really hope I do not come when it is busy because it took quite a bit of time to make the ice cream so i can just imagine how long it would take to get one if there are others in front of me."

The ingredients are healthier than regular ice cream and the show of making the ice cream is fun to watch but those are the only 2 good parts.\nIt took a good 5-10 minutes to make each of ours and there were 2 customers in front of us, so it was a good 30 minutes before mine was ever made (ladies first!). The real disappointment was the flavor. Between us we tried vanilla with peanut butter cup, chocolate with chocolate chips and mint chocolate chip with walnuts. They were all \"OK\" but the flavors seemed muted. It is expensive and so based on the time spent and the overall flavor we will not be back. Why is there no Carvel in Vegas when you need one?"

So when I found out they had opened one at Harrah's in Vegas, I had to make a stop... or two... or three... fine, four times, okay. Located on the second floor by the monorail and bridge connection between Imperial Palace, I took my boyfriend here as a surprise since he, too, loved ice Pan when I first took him to the one in Santa Monica.\n\nSo I noticed a lot of people were laughing, not sure at or with the owner of Ice Pan. You see, the owner is unbelievably nice and really loves providing people the fresh and sugar-free ice cream he has created. He's enthusiastic to the extreme. Some people find that weird but I find that good customer service. i want the person whom takes my order to be over-the-top friendly. I want suggestions and to be explained how the place works. The owner high five me because it was NOT my first time and fist bump my boyfriend. \n\nSo we got the strawberry sorbet with cheesecake topping with soy milk. You pick a flavor ice cream, the kind of milk you want them to use, and one topping that they'll mix in. In addition, the staff was nice enough to add fresh strawberries on top of our ice cream. Love that they aren't cheapening out. A small is a good enough dessert portion for two, especially after a buffet dinner in Vegas. \n\nYour ice cream is made to order and you can watch them make it in front of you. In fact, it's encouraged and part of the Ice Pan experience to watch the staff make your ice cream from scratch. There are just a couple of tables in front of Ice Pan and those same tables are shared with the Starbucks next to it. Good thing ice cream can be one of those walk-and-eat kind of treats. \n\nA definite hidden gem in Vegas you do not want to miss."

I've been seeing viral clips on Facebook and been wanting to go one. Thank god, one open up in Vegas. \n\nLocated in Harrahs hotel. Go on the escalators right before you enter the casino (this is coming from the parking lot side), it's on the second floor, right next to Starbucks. \n\nThe service is really good. I really like the guy who was helping us. He knows how to make jokes and know what flavors to mix. I got the strawberry cheesecake and my friend got the pineapple with coconut. I admit, the ice cream itself was really really good...for only the first few bites. After that, it gets really really heavy. My friend and I couldn't even finish half and had to throw the other half away. Also I don't think it's worth the price, $7 for a small? I guess it's the price to pay for a good show. \n\nI highly suggest if you want to give this place a try, share the ice cream with someone. One person cannot finish that thing by yourself."

They have a wide variety of ice cream flavors and the best part of this place is that you can choose what kind of MILK you want.. nonfat, soy, whole milk, etc. We opted for the green tea because that's one of our favorite flavors and by recommendation, we went with soy milk.

Watching the process of making the ice cream from this powdery thing to a nice cup in front of you was so awesome!

Please TAKE NOTE of this since it is not advertised until you look at the brochures.\nAnyways, I was in the mood for ice cream on the Strip and found this place with overall positive reviews on Yelp so decided to try! Ice Pan is located on the 2nd floor in Harrah's near the Toby Keith grill right next to the escalator. I was thinking this was similar to a Cold Stone at first but then saw the ice cream was actually made starting from a liquid then formed into a solid with toppings. The mini \"show\" of the staff making the ice cream is cool to watch and there are plenty of different combinations/toppings you could create. \nPrices are a bit steep, there's only one size and each topping is 50 cents. I had the vanilla with soy with oreos and m and m's for around $7. The guy that made it offered to remake a new one in case I didn't like it also. \nNow back to the upset stomach....apparently the ice cream contains some kind of mystery ingredient I've never heard of called \"FOS.\" Its helps to relieve constipation and accelerate the....well, you get the picture. Now obviously this wouldn't be advertised on signs or warned by the staff when you place your order but I seriously had stomach issues a few hours after.

I have gone here enough times that the owner and his wife know me by my face. That's funny because I don't know their names either. Regardless if you are a first timer or veteran he treats you with good customer service and courtesy.\n\nSince you are in a casino on the strip well, you are gonna be subjected to the usual mark up of strip prices. This is where the one star is subtracted because I have yet to find a place on the strip that is 5 star worthy of paying strip prices. Also, the cell reception is non existent in this area unless you wanna pay the ridiculous price they charge you to use the casino wifi.\n\nIn closing, this concept is as unique as you can get with making ice cream from scratch. Definitely come here for dessert after a good lunch or dinner. It will sure hit the spot. Hours are 11 am to 12 midnight everyday.\n\nYelp 2015 review #7\n506 overall"

Customers can choose from a variety of flavors and ingredients to add in and every order is made from scratch with fresh ingredients right in front of your eyes.  Because fresh ingredients are used and customers have their choice of ingredients and type of milk, Ice Pan's ice cream is relatively more nutritious than other ice cream options at only 200 calories a cup.  After 2 minutes of watching your creation come together, the result is a delicous creamy ice cream with the perfect blend of flavor and refreshment.  \n\nNot only does Ice Pan offer great ice cream, but a fun and unique experience.  The two guys who were working here were extremely friendly, energetic, and made sure customers had fun creating their ice cream.  They even remembered me when I returned two days later!  Since Ice Pan is tucked away in a hidden location that one will probably only find if they are going to the Harrah's Las Vegas monorail stop, there was never a long wait.       \n\nThis is the only location of Ice Pan in the United States and will definately be a must on all future trips to Vegas!"

She said she'd give me free strawberries on top of my ice cream!  yay for free stuff.  i ended up giving them an extra tip for it!\n\nIt's really cool to watch your ice cream turn form from liquid to solid.  Pour liquid and slap the ice cream on a cold circular slab many times....and then it turns to solid!  \n\nI got a regular for $5.95 which includes one topping.  You choose your flavor, type of milk (soy, whole, low fat, non-fat), and toppings.  50 cents for each topping.\n\nI got the strawberry, low-fat milk, with chocolate chips and got free strawberries on top.  I also got chocolate syrup.  Yummy!  It tasted pretty light and not too heavy or super creamy but a little bit icy.\n\nIt is good ice cream, just super expensive for ice cream!  $7 with the tip, for a small!\n\nI was reading the info leaflet about ice pan...and it has a warning that ice pan has some ingredients in the ice cream that is somewhat like a laxative...I was lol at the comment when I read it."

You get to pick your flavor, milk, and toppings and they make your ice cream right in front of you! I was lucky to go at a time when there was no line but a bunch of people came after me and had to wait a while, and there was only one worker. I'd say it took about 8 minutes to make 2 orders, one for myself and one for my friend. Other than that, very cool experience!"

It was super super thick and didnt melt as fast as the milk one. They had a warning on their pamphlet saying that it speeds up your digestive system so you might have loose stools after consuming. i still ate it anyways. Its been 2 days and i still have loose stools. Not sure if it was from the ice cream or the boiling crab. No one else in my party has it so. Maybe its just me."

They put the blended mix on a -35 degree surface. They mix/smash in your topping as the liquid turns into ice cream.\n       - Taste - Best ice cream I've ever had.\n       - Location - Second floor of Harrah's near the monorail station.\n       - Calories - Calories/sugar for a cup of Haagen Daz strawberry ice is 500 calories/44g. The calories/sugar for the low fat milk strawberry ice cream I had was 280 calories/36g.\n       - Payment - Cash only.\n**Price**\n       - $5.95 for a regular size + 50 cents per topping.\n**Ordered**\n       - Strawberry Ice Cream with Kiwi topping - Best strawberry ice cream I've ever head. They mash up the toppings in like cold stone.\n       - Oreo Ice Cream - You can taste the Oreo filling in the ice cream.\n       - Red Bean Ice Cream with Lychee topping - The Lychee really sweetened up the ice cream.\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone. The ice cream is delicious and fresh and the price isn't too bad either."

Tucked away on the 2nd floor of Harrah's, it might be a bit hard to find with all the renovation going on, but we just asked around until someone directed us to it. \n\nThe concept itself is quite unique compared to the other ice cream/gelato/froyo places along the strip. First, you choose your ice cream flavor. Then you choose what type of dairy you want mixed in (whole, low fat, non fat, soy milk, or no milk for sorbets) and finally choose your mix-in + toppings. At $5.95 + extra for the toppings, it is a bit steep for 4 little scoops of ice cream, but I suppose you're paying more for the show since you get to see them pour, chop, and slap your ice cream into shape on the anti griddle. \n\nThe owner is very enthusiastic and engaging with all of the customers, but the wait itself was very very long. Even with only 2 people in front of us, we waited over 20mins for our ice cream.. And they even mixed up the toppings, but we didn't bother asking them to change it since that would've taken even longer. As for the ice cream, the consistency seemed a bit off with more like a taffy texture, and not as creamy or flavorful as I was hoping it would be. This place is good to entertain kids, but if you're looking for some quick, creamy ice cream, I'd say go elsewhere."

I thought the reduced fat milk worked really well. I did not feel overly full at all after eating it like I do sometimes after ice cream. \n\nThe biggest problem here is the amount of time it takes to have your ice cream made. It may take somewhere in the neighborhood of five minutes. So the person I was with (who eats a bit on the faster side) was almost done by the time mine was ready. I am not sure how well this concept would work if there were 4-5 people in a group wanting this product and only one person was working as was the case for us.

After 15 minutes of contemplating if I had any more room\nin my stomach after a big lunch (who am I kidding?! There's always room for ice cream!) my boyfriend and I decided to try the soy milk watermelon ice cream with mangos and raspberries. Sounds weird I know, but it actually tasted pretty good and seemed much healthier then regular ice cream. Not to mention there's always something always intriguing about seeing food being made fresh before your eyes."

I love love the ice cream here! I got mango with mango chunks.  They make it on the pan and its a pretty fast service. It is kinda pricey for icecream but definitely worth it. Definitely would recommend going here. But signs to the ice cream place is kinda lacking in the hotel. Its on the second floor next to toby keiths bar. A definite visit in vegas!"

If you like your dessert  thick and gooy, this may be a good place to visit.

Here's how:\n\n1) In spite of the discomfort, it was still DANG good ice cream and an awesomely unique experience.\n2) There was some funkiness going on with the lunch I had that day and, who knows, maybe I ate something then or at dinner that's the actual culprit - I can't say for sure it was the Ice Pan\n3) I recommended the place to a number of coworkers who all ate it, loved it, and had no negative effects\n\nSo, in spite of the *possibility* of it giving me a Central-American-class punch in the gut, Ice Pan's still an amazingly delicious and entertaining gig in the heart of Sin City."

After going up the escalators, it's located right around the corner- a cute open ice cream area with a couple tables. \n\nAs I was deciding what to order, I felt so giddy inside knowing that I can eat my sweet treat without worrying about rumblies in my tumbly. This was my first time being able to choose how my ice cream was made! How cool is it that you can choose what goes into your ice cream as well as watch it be made before your eyes??! I chose the red bean ice cream, soy milk, and lychee as the fruit topping. The workers happily took my order and rang me up for about 5 bucks (for a cup of ice cream it's pretty pricey but you're paying for the work and quality). The science in this is amazing. The flavored red bean and soymilk was poured onto this nitrogen cooled plate and magically before my eyes, the goddess of a worker created this icey consistency of the mixture- slapping and scraping scraping scraping until it solidified a bit. Once that was done, she dropped a couple of lychees atop and chopped them into the mixture. Slapping, scraping, mixing, my creation was finally done right before my eyes. I savored each creamy bite. SUPER CREAMY, as a matter of fact! I was a happy camper.  I enjoyed this new experience, greeted by the cutest workers, right within sin city, and came out with something healthy, sweet, and ice creamy- i felt like i walked on a mini cloud above the devil's playground- if that made any sense.

Then I checked online and saw the video how they made it (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcXOROJjSgo&feature=player_embedded).  It was impressive and I couldn't wait to try them the next time I would stop by.\n\nThey're located on the 2nd floor of Harrah's next to the Starbucks.  Nice location since they get a lot of foot traffic for people coming to and from the Monorail and those needing some dessert after getting a bite at Toby Keith's.  I really couldn't decide what to order because they have so many different combinations.  But I ended up going for the Mango Ice Cream with Soy Milk with Pineapples mixed in.  I loved the energy they put in to making the ice cream (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=AMSH3KItrpDss6_jJhoL2w).

I didn't opt for the chocolate syrup because I didn't want it to interfere with the natrual fruit flavors, but maybe next time.  It was so good!!!  I was able to really taste natural flavors of the mango and pineapples.  The price may seem a little steep at $6.95, but you're paying for a nice one minute show of them preparing ice cream from scratch with fresh ingredients.  It's worth it!\n\nUPDATE 11/28/2010: Found an updated video from the Harrah's location here:\n(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVb8BUtrCeg)\nIt's Awesome!!!"

This establishment is indeed somewhat pricey, but if you compare it to every other place on the strip, it is a perfectly acceptable amount to pay for a dessert.\n\nThe taste is nothing phenomenal, but they way they prepare it kinda is. the ice cream is made right in front of you as they turn milk and fruit into customized ice cream. The cream is poured onto this chilled pan / wok and freezes almost instantly. The ice cream masters then proceed to stir, scrape, slap, and slice the ice cream using knife-like spatulas with such speed and precision that you'd think you were watching a Benihana chef in action. Seriously, if they brought a knife to a gun fight, they would still have a chance at coming out on top.\n\nAs for eating the ice cream, the taste was a little light, which is kinda nice after a heavy Las Vegas meal, but deep down, I was kinda hoping for a little more umph from the flavor. Depending on who you get to prepare it, the consistency can be super creamy or hard and dense. If you get a more senior preparer, the cream comes out very smooth and can be almost gelato-like. If your preparer is the young one who has yet to master the tricks of the trade, the cream may be left on the ice pan a bit too long and freeze a little harder than it probably should.\n\nWith both ups and downs to this eatery, I think the Yelp rating system hit this one right on the mark, it is A-OK."

Watermelon (current seasonal flavor) was quite yummy, but only offered for a limited time.  Future seasonal flavors include pumpkin for the fall and pomegranate for the winter.  We got strawberry with strawberries, green tea with mochi, and watermelon with strawberries and raspberries- all were delish and naturally sweet.  Definitely a must try if you are in town!"

It has a banner saying its first priority is to provide healthier lifestyle, which sounds ironic for an ice cream parlor, but you'll get the point later. \n\nYou know how there is always various flavor selections in glass display at most ice cream place, prompting you to make the most difficult decision of your life? Well, there isn't any here. This is because they mix everything after you order. How it goes is, you select the ice cream base, then select the milk type and finally the toppings. \n\nAfter some serious pondering, I eventually went with red bean ice cream with soy milk, then mochi and pecans as toppings. The guy started mixing everything up which showed they tried to make things as fresh as possible. The stuff slowly taking shape and while I was busy being mesmerized, it was done! The end result is few scoops of delicious ice cream that is not overpoweringly sweet. So in a way, this is healthier then usual ice cream. We absolutely love it! The chewy mochi and crunchy pecans give an interesting texture combination with every bite, I am proud of myself for choosing those lol. \n\nI would totally come here again when I feel burnt and err.. want something healthy."

Certain flavors taste better than others - i.e. strawberry tastes more like a sorbet. My taste buds are too accustomed to the creaminess of ice cream and can really tell the difference - so I have a hard time liking the flavor. People shouldn't call it ice cream because that would be misleading, it's more of an in between of the asian shaved ice that's only slightly creamy. I've tried the coffee, green tea, mint chip, and strawberry so far because I really wanted to like it - I'll give this place 4 stars instead of 3 because I want to support what they're doing and the flavors just might not be for me."

Choose the type of milk (whole, non fat, low fat, soy, etc), 3. Choose toppings!\n\nI got the Chocolate flavored non fat cream with Bananas and Oreos. I feel like you can really taste the banana when they make the ice cream or any type of fruit topping is better than a dry topping. It's 50 cents more for an extra topping! The ice cream isn't as creamy as I like it to be, but I bumped this review up for the experience. \n\nThis place is pretty darn expensive but it's definitely worth a try if you haven't been there. The way they make the ice cream is so cool and it's supposed to be healthier.. But definitely a hidden gem in Vegas"

An ice cream job they must seriously love their job. This is what brings crowds\nNOW.\nTHE PRICE. Was of course high being on the strip but the service doe. 6$ for something you could get for 1$ at a rite aid but this is entertainment, amazing service, and great and health ice cream. Is it worth the 6$? Well if you ask me yes. CMON! ITS VEGAS! A PLACE WHERE I DONT FIND LOTS OF GOOD SERVICE BUT. THIS. IS AWESOME!!!\nNow enough praise about the service \nFOOD- I got whole milk vanilla and strawberry..  Totaling to 13$ I was like whoa. But then you get the entertainment of making the ice cream ;3 very unique..it brought a huge crowd and the ice cream wasn't bad and it tasted healthy :3 especially the strawberry it's a sorbet..I'm gonna try green tea and see how it goes :)\n\nUPDATE* Absolutely delicious soy milk green tea RECOMMENDED. Tasted much better then vanilla and strawberry in my opinion. IF YOU GET GREEN TEA SOY MILK YOU MUST GET MOCHI TOPPINGS!! 100% recommended\n\nTIP!!! LOCATION!! (PERTAINS TO YOU ONLY IF YOUR STAYING AT HARRAHS CARNIVAL TOWER)\n1. Head to carnival tower elevator (1-24 I think) \n2. Click level 2 \n3. BAM!!! ICE PAN INFRONT OF YOUR VERY OWN EYES! NOT CRAVING ICE CREAM? PERHAPS A STARBUCKS INFRONT WILL HELP :33 very convenient as i thought I would have to walk with these sore feet across jarrahs to find ice pan."

I found this place onYelp and had to take a $11 cab ride from Monte Carlo to Harrah's just for this ice cream. I saw a fast talking, very funny, pleasant men and a warm, young lady (perhaps his daughter) making ice cream by pouring liquid cream on pans and tossing the frozen cream hard on the cold pan many times.  I was told that I could choose one base ingredient for each order, so I picked red bean and had it topped with fresh strawberries. The whole process took a few minutes but it tasted delicious, fresh and flavorful. Will definitely come back here the next time I'm in LV."

No signage on the casino floor. I know this is not necessarily Ice Pan's fault, but they need to address this. \n\nWhen you finally do reach the second floor, the place looks awesome. They had two employees making ice cream from scratch in cold pans.\n\nHowever, it takes FOREVER just to make one customer's ice cream! Be prepared to wait a half and hour or more if there a couple people ahead of you.\n\nLike other Yelpers mentioned, the manager/cashier/owner guy is VERY talkative. While he seems cool at first, he does all this hard selling (explains the calorie difference between regular ice cream, shows you fresh strawberries, etc). After about two minutes, it gets really old. He makes weird jokes while you are waiting and tries to have you do all these bizarre handshakes. I was chatting with a client of mine on my cell phone, and the manager guy wouldn't leave me alone! Seriously, it is one thing to be friendly with your customers, but if I'm obviously busy on my phone, there is no need to constantly annoy me!\n\nAfter waiting another 15 minutes, an employee finally started to prepare my ice cream. I ordered decaf coffee with soy milk, raspberries, chocolate chips, and strawberries. The base mix she started with came out of some sketch machine (didn't look as \"natural\" as the manager was saying it was). About 5 minutes later, it was near completion. She added the fruit and chocolate chips in and then asked \"Would you like coconut? It will taste yummy!\". I can't stand coconut and replied with a clear \"No thanks.\". She continued making my ice cream and then tossed a bunch of coconut in like it was no issue and said \"You'll like it!\". Are you kidding me? I paid a crapload of money for this \"trendy\" ice cream and she just throws coconut in after I say I don't want it?! At that point, I just took the ice cream and left. I wasn't interested in waiting any longer. \n\nOn top of the whole situation, the actual ice cream was also disappointing. It tasted worse than any other regular ice cream. Honestly, aside from cutting calories, I would say it tasted like something I whipped up at home in two minutes. Definitely not worth it!\n\nOk, here comes the worst part! I read in some brochure they have after eating a significant amount of my ice cream that it causes \"accelerated bowel movements\". They claimed this was \"natural\" and \"healthy\". Let me tell you, my stomach was so BAD the whole night! I couldn't stop using the restroom.\n\nAll in all, save yourself the time, money, frustration, and bowel movements and head to one of the many ice cream shops inside the other resorts (the cafes inside the Bellagio have excellent, fresh ice cream with professional employees!)."

My mint chocolate chip was PHENOMENAL plus it was low fat and friendly to my lactose intolerance since I chose soy milk. The nice owners even suggested extra toppings and didn't charge me for them!! \n\nThis is an Asian-based company (maybe Japanese? I'm not sure) that's taking a healthy approach to ice cream (no artificial ingredients). Instead, their ice cream contains something called FOS (fructooligosaccharide) which I think they use as a natural sweetener (its derived from seaweed). \n\nThe best part of this place is that you get to watch the make your ice cream right in front o!f you...it's a lot of pounding and slapping of the ice cream... a fun show to watch... bring your kids."

I instead chose the seasonal watermelon flavor with pineapple, lychee, and soy flavor. I watch them make it fresh. It reminded me of Thai style ice cream making, but it's pretty different in technique. Instead of rolling it into a roll it will scoop up with the fruit toppings infuse in them.

Unfortunately, I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED by the Las Vegas version of Ice Pan and I will probably never eat there again.\n\nI ordered a large and was told Ice Pan now only comes in one size. That size is TINY. (Smaller than Pinkberry's 'small'). At their West Hollywood location, Ice Pan used to give twice as much ice cream and charge half as less!! The tiny amount I was given cost $5.95 + tax and the employee informed me that Ice Pan no longer does punch cards.

The employee informed me the owner probably isn't ever going to re-open the West Hollywood location or any location in CA again. (There used to be another Ice Pan in Redondo Beach). No love for CA. BUMMER."

It's rather tricky to find, but I eventually found it after walking around the casino a few times. From what I recall, it's located just at the top of the escalator after you walk past the Fulton Street food hall. \n\nI'm glad I did not give up trying to find it, as the ice cream was amazing. I had the green tea made with soya milk with mochi. The ice cream was surprising smooth and creamy, considering it's made in front of you and not churned in a machine. The ice cream itself was not too sweet which was great. Also, the person who served me was super friendly and energetic. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place. It is well worth the walk from wherever you are on the strip."

Then they pour it onto a freezing pan and spread it throughout the pan so it is evenly freezed. Then they smack it back and forth on pan and ta da you have ice cream!!! The banana ice cream with strawberries was most definitely my favorite:)\n\nThey also sell $1 ice pops made from real fruit! \n\nThe service is very friendly. The two ladies who work there, do a very good job of making the ice creams. They are attentive to their customers and always make sure their customers are happy. At the time I arrive at the ice cream shop, a random man was there complaining about his ice cream. The workers felt bad a immediately gave everyone a free ice cold water bottle. It was very kind of them considering most places wouldn't pay attention to your complaint."

The only downside is if there's a long line the wait will probably take forever since it looks like they only have one ice cream making station and it takes a few minutes for them to make. Because of that it's also not the best place to go if you're in a rush and just looking for a really quick snack.\n\nFor better or for worse though I doubt there is ever much of a line here just because it's tucked away in the Harrah's Casino. It took forever for me to find it so to spare you, if you're in the casino just follow the signs to the monorail or the pool and you'll be lead upstairs. It's on your immediate left next to the Starbucks. Enjoy!"

You choose the flavors you want and the type of milk you want (whole, skim, fat free, soy) and things you want in the ice cream too... they start beating it in their pan... the harder they beat it, the creamier it gets (that's what she said, lol)... SO GOOD!  I chose strawberry with whole milk and added mochi... it was really creamy and good but I don't think mochi was a good idea because it gets hard when it gets too cold.  Please open a Bay Area location so I can try different things out!  The owners and workers are so friendly and nice... I feel bad that it's not busier since it's in Harrah's and hidden upstairs in a corner.  They need to move to a higher volume location and they would make more business to expand to the bay! lol..."

First, Ice Pan is only located here and has 2 locations in Japan!  Second, they use a frozen \"pan\" to freeze the milk and create ice cream, and boy does it take some serious arm strength!\n\nI told the associate I am a first timer - he welcomed me loudly, fist bumped me, and gave me brochures about the healthy benefits of Ice Pan ice cream.  He also let me see the real matcha powder used to make the green tea ice cream.  I ordered soy milk green tea with mochi.  The price is $6.97 with tax...but woops - it is cash only!  AHHHH.  I had $6.25 plus an enormous amount of pennies.  First, the associate told me I could just pay on my return.  Then he willingly took my $6.25, so I was short 52 cents.\n\nI watched the lady sling and power my soy milk matcha mochi concoction into scoopable ice cream and into the carton.  The associate who took my order made sure I was happy with the taste, then he asked me, \"Are you single?\" after glancing at my ring.  I told him no, and he laughed and told the lady next to me, \"But she is a TEENAGER!\" so that was fun.\n\nEvery person gets greeted, fist bumped, and asked to watch the creation of their treat.  It is a neat concept even if a tad expensive.  Just remember, CASH ONLY!!!"

The hubs and I decided on the coffee ice cream with whole milk.  I'm usually not a fan of toppings so I opted out.  It's 50 cents for toppings.  I liked watching the process of them making the ice cream: they measure out some milk, add a little cup of something (looked like powdered coffee to me), blended it all up and it was ready for the ice cold \"pan\"!  I was so excited but was disappointed with the first bite.  It was way too icy and didn't have much flavor.  Not sweet enough (and that's saying something coming from me!) and wasn't creamy at all.  For a whopping $5.95 it was probably the biggest letdown of the weekend."

Maybe if they gave one more then yes, but one goes inside and they put the other on top after your ice cream is done being made. So for my ice cream I believe it came to $7.65 for it? I don't remember the actual price, but it was around there.\n\nOverall, this place is good, I would come back, but it's not one of those places where I want to or need to go again in my next visit. It's just something to try out and experience.\n\nOh this is also a good place for those who are allergic to dairy. :]"

(It's located at the second floor of Harrah's hotel, just take the escalator up and it's pretty much the first store you'll see on the left) The ice cream I tasted at the Ice Pan was definitely one of the highlights of my vegas trip! Ordering my ice cream was pretty tough because there's so many ice cream flavors and combination that you can come up with! Btw! They have a sheet of paper that is kind of a guide with which Ice Cream flavor doesn't really blend well with which toppings, but even so, you're totally entitled to your own flavor and combinations! \n\nThe best part is seeing the ice cream made, they turned liquid milk into ice cream and the process is so fascinating to watch! I ordered Vanilla flavored ice cream, whole milk with the toppings of strawberries and mochi. I played it safe, but it honestly turned out really great! The consistency was different and the mixing of mochi, strawberry and vanilla turned out very delicious. \n\nP.S! They have healthier milk choices and an alternative for people who are diabetic\nDefinitely would come back to this place for the next Vegas trip. 5/5 stars well deserved!!"

AND YOU DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE CALORIES & SUGARS SINCE ALL THE ICE CREAM IS LESS THAN 200 CALORIES PER REGULAR ORDER. \n\nFor a regular order of ice cream = $6.95. For me I thought the price was worth it because of the freshness. \n\nThe service was unbelievable!! The man who was in the cashier told us about the nutritional facts and showed us the brochure to give us more information. He also told us if we didn't like it, he would make a new one. I never had such fun and nice service from an ice cream place until I tried things here. \n\nHe also saw that my friends and I were thirsty from the water so he gave us free, cold water bottles for free!

We tried a variety of flavors during our visit including mango, green grape, coconut, strawberry among others. \n\nThe servers are so nice as well.    Our first visit D learned that the lady working there hailed from Japan originally so she and D struck a conversation just talking about that. \n\nAs she was making my ice cream and talking to D I couldn't help but notice some kind of contraption she had on her face covering part of her mouth.   I realized later on it was there to keep their saliva from hitting any part of the ice pans or your future ice cream.   So cool.\n\nThe remaining days we chatted with a worker from Bulgaria.  The workers were so nice which in addition to the tasty and healthier product was another reason for our return visits.\n\nSo sad they don't have a place like this in Chicagoland.  When we get back to Vegas, this will definitely be a spot worth returning to no matter where we stay at next time."

It is pretty small with about 3 tables, so don't expect to sit here to eat. \n\nI ordered Watermelon with Pineapple. You choose your flavor, milk/cream, then add-ins. \n\nPresentation (5/5): As everyone previously already mentioned. People usually come here just to see how it is made. The ice cream liquid is blended and placed on a freezing cold metal pan where it slowly freezes and they hand mix the ice cream till its a nice fluffy texture. Takes awhile but its fun to watch. \n\nFood (5/5): I loved that this random combination worked. I loved that i watched them blend my watermelon from fresh fruit and that they didn't just throw pineapples in/ontop of my ice cream but they actually chopped up the pineapples and folded it into the final product. My only wish was that it was creamier and smoother. \n\nPrice(3.5/5): Its honestly kind of pricey for me. $8 for a small cup. I guess the extra goes to the workers having to work so hard to mix and make the ice cream but still, pretty pricey for a small (but decent sized) cup.\n\nService (5/5): Excellent and very helpful"

Hidden in the Harrahs casino, this place is great if you're looking for a quick and healthy dessert. Everything is all-natural, no added sweeteners and made right on the spot. \n\nUpon arrival, the owner greeted us and asked if it was our first time. He was adorably enthusiastic and couldn't stop high-fiving us while he described the whole process. It's three parts: 1) base flavor (chocolate/peanut butter/sorbet/etc) 2) dairy option (whole/non-fat/soy milk) and 3) toppings or mix-ins. He then proceeded to show us examples of the matcha green tea and the cocoa powder used in the ice creams. It all smelled wonderful.\n\nI chose green tea ice cream with non fat milk mixed with Oreo. The lady was very sweet and asked if I liked mochi, I said yes and she added some to my cup. \n\nMy friend chose chocolate ice cream with non fat milk mixed with half a banana and topped off with strawberries and chocolate syrup. \n\nBoth were delicious and reasonably priced (~$7 each), which sounds wonderfully cheap compared to the $8 I was swindled out of at Jamba Juice. We couldn't believe they were nonfat. They were just as creamy and just as sweet as any other ice cream you would fine, but without all the bad stuff. The owner insisted we try it in front of him and if we truly did not like it, he would make us something else. Needless to say, he did not need to make us another because we left with happy bellies :)"

It's not like Cold Stone, where they mash the ice cream together. Instead, they pour the liquid mixture of your ice cream over the Ice Pan, which eventually freezes the mixture over a span of 30 seconds. The person will add desired fruits or toppings onto the ice cream, continue to mix well until firm, and then scoop into a cup for you to enjoy!\n\nSo how does it work at Ice Pan?\n\n1. Choose your flavor: strawberry, mango, banana, green tea, vanilla, chocolate, mint chocolate, kiwi, yogurt, coffee, lemon, pistachio, peanut butter\n\n2. Choose your milk base: whole, low-fat, non-fat, soy milk\n\n3. Choose your topping (extra cost): strawberry, banana, kiwi, blueberry, pineapple, mango, almond, oreo cookies, reese's cups, mochi, lychee, etc\n\nMy bf and I ordered the mint chocolate chip ice cream with whole milk and Oreo topping along with Peanut butter ice cream with whole milk and Reese's topping. This place does not use refined sugar and the ice cream is creamy and does not have that extra sugary taste, which I liked! Overall, it was a very healthy treat.\n\nMy only gripe about this place is that the smallest size costs about $5-6. That's pretty steep in my opinion. However, when one is traveling in Vegas - it's okay to splurge once in awhile for some good healthy ice cream. =)"

            "review": "On our last afternoon in town, my fiancee and I were in the mood for a sweet bite after doing a little bit of gambling and shopping. While you can probably find a Ben and Jerry's (or something similar) in numerous places around the Strip, we decided to come to Ice Pan to try something a bit different. Admittedly, part of the 'cool' factor of this place is how they make the ice cream - it resembles a slightly more violent version of whipping up scrambled eggs - but the ice cream itself is pretty good. I went with an Asian-inspired ice cream - red bean with mochi and strawberries - and came away pretty impressed. The red bean flavor was strong but not overpowering, and the mochi was mixed in well enough to give it an interesting texture.\n\nHowever, it's not as good as the straight-up standard ice cream you can get at a boutique shop. Another qualm is the minimum starting price and size; the small is going to set you back at least $5-6 (if you get literally nothing else in terms of toppings), and while you are paying for portion - the size comes out to around 4-5 smaller scoops - it's still quite a bit of ice cream to take down in one shot. The other problem is timing; there have to be more than 2 people working there, or else you simply get bogged down, as one person has to focus on making your ice cream, and that takes at least 3-5 minutes if they don't have to stop in-between to prepare other batches or take orders at the register. It's certainly unique, but the flavor is not so mind-blowingly good that I would wait another 15 minutes just to get served ice cream.\n\nIs it worth trying out once for the concept? Sure - and if there is no one else there, you may as well take the plunge - but otherwise, you may have to wait a while to satisfy your sweet tooth."

Be prepared to wait a while; we checked out Ice Pan on a weekday during the late afternoon and despite being 2 of about 5 people in the queue, it still took about 15 minutes for the Ice Pan folks to start our order.  We forgot that pain as soon as we tasted our dessert though.  :)"

I've seen this place since taking my property tour in orientation. I see it everyday while ordering Starbucks! Well today I got to work a little too early and decided to drop by(out of uniform).\n\nI love pistachios so I chose that as my flavor, whole milk, and mochi as my mix in. She made suggestions as to what goes well with pistachio but I new what i wanted lol. She blended the milk, some flavoring, and pistachios all together the poured onto the -30 degrees ice pan! She scraped and mixed it then added my mochi! She suggested I put caramel on top and I agreed to a little bit so I could still taste the pistachio! Let me tell you! This ice cream is unique and delicious! The pistachios were blended down so there is a nice texture to the ice cream. I chose mochi because its not too sweet and doesn't change the flavor of the ice cream like if I were to add bananas or pb cups. All in all I love this ice cream and I'm excited to explore the menu a little more because there are a TON of options but I was honed in on pistachio :) I highly suggest ice pan if you're have a sweet tooth :)"

Giving you multiple options from a 3 step process and letting you decide how much milk fat you want to ingest into your system.  While I can appreciate this whole process and it was fairly fun to watch, for $8.05 I would have expected more.  Everything else was great.\n\nItems Ordered:\nStep One - Chocolate\nStep Two - Non Fat Milk\nStep Three - Pecans, Walnuts, Marshmellows, Chocolate Chips and Chocolate Drizzle\n\nThe texture is rather nice, but still produces a hint of slight freezer burn.  I can imagine that this is a result of the ice cream process being at -35 degrees.  The person making the ice cream cleverly chopped up all of my selections into one organized and thoroughly mix of my selections so I could savor each bite.  Was delicious, my only gripe would be the price.  A cold stone ice cream concept with the actual ice cream made in front of you is the only major difference."

Loved his enthusiasm in explaining the way things worked to my friends that haven't been there before. He was keen on making sure they knew how much of a healthier and better alternative this was to regular ice cream, all natural and fresh ingredients, and tastes just as amazing as any other old ice cream\n\nFirst time  I came I think I tried the red bean and green tea both with whole milk which were not bad.\n\nThe second time I came, I got the whole milk with strawberry and cheesecake bites and he topped it off with fresh strawberries, none of that artificial crap, to add even more healthiness and flavor to my selection. This is one of the best combinations guys believe me. I get something similar at cold stones too.\n\nPretty pricey,but entertaining and interesting concept in making ice cream by pounding it intensely in front of customers. Give it a try its at least worth the experience once."

Is that weird? Or maybe you're just weird for having stepped foot inside this place!\n\nAnyways...this place is absolutely amazing! Apparently, it is the only one in the U.S. currently. I believe they had one in Hollywood at one point though. I don't know why they don't have these all over. Forget Coldstone & Marble Slab! This is pretty much ice cream made to order, while you watch. The girl that was working behind the counter was such a spitfire & really friendly & full of information & certainly a master of her craft; by far one of the most enthusiastic & happy employees that I have ever met & that took so much pride in her work; definitely a model employee.\n\nI ordered a banana base, with non fat milk, Reeses' peanut butter cup, and more bananas, finished off with caramel, in a cup. It was a very neat process to watch. She was very fast & methodical, as well as precise, as she slapped it up, flipped it, and rubbed it down, OH NO! & Boom! Ice cream.\n\nIt was soooo good! It is very misleading when they first start to make it, because it yields a lot more than what you think it might make.\n\nI hope this place grows & grows! I think it is a great way to make ice cream & will probably catch on. I know they have plans forlocations in Kuwait & Dubai, which will really do well over there. I think places like this are kind of lost on the U.S. demographic though.\n\nI highly recommend this place!"

I was absolutely blown away!\n\nI love the range of flavor selections. I love how they flavor their ice cream solely with whatever fruit/ingredient the ice cream is based on. The banana ice cream is flavored with a pureed banana. The coffee iced cream is flavored with shots of espresso. So perfect!\n\nI have to admit that the furthest I will venture from my go-to coffee flavor choice is stealing bites of whatever my girlfriend gets. Ice Pan's coffee ice cream is the best I've had! The espresso comes through nice and bold, and is not overly sweetened like most coffee ice cream.\n\nWhat keeps me coming back to Ice Pan is the unique texture of their product. If you've been to Humphry Slocombe in SF, you will recognize Ice Pan's texture. The ice cream is densely frozen and very cold, but not hard. It is like a collection of quick-melting micro-crystals of ice. As explained by Ice Pan's charismatic owner, this texture is achieved by forcefully slapping the ice cream against the pan as it freezes, thus eliminating air bubbles.\n\nAll of their employees are very energetic and friendly. They talk to you about the process as they make your ice cream, while they laugh and joke. The owner is a hilarious guy- expect at least three high-fives per visit. He also likes to suggest toppings as he throws your ice cream, throwing them in for free if you approve.\n\nFor their unique product, memorable customer experience, and quality ingredients, Ice Pan is worth the extra few dollars per serving over average ice cream shops, and epitomizes what I love in local food."

It was a matter of hours before I found myself drooling before the menu. \nThe cute Asian women took my order. I ordered a combination of fruit, milk and toppings. As soon as I ordered she suggested I picked a different variation of flavors. I took her advice and boy oh boy am I glad!!\nNow, don't be fooled by her petite size. She chops, cuts and throws the blob of ice cream on the \"ice pan\" to mix and freeze the mixture. This in itself is a show that brought a crowd of people watching her. \n\nBut really, this is the best ice cream I have ever had. It's fresh, and the perfect amount of sweetness. The only way I could describe the amazing goodness is HEAVEN! \n\nI want to officially welcome Ice Pan to Las Vegas and will continue to visit and eat healthy and sweet."

            "review": "I bookmarked Ice Pan right after my last trip to Vegas two years ago since I couldn't believe I missed this place when I passed thru Harrah's last time. Situated on the 2nd floor towards the monorail station of Harrah's Casino, immediately hang a left at the top of the stairs. (For reference, Harrah's is right across the street from Ceasar's Forum Shops and the Mirage.)\n\nIce Pan makes your ice cream or sorbet from scratch right in front your eyes. So it takes time. ALOT OF TIME. I was on vacation so I was all comme ci, comme \u00e7a about it. You get to watch all the ice cream \"action\" going on at the very least. So if you're pressed for time this is not the place for you. I waited almost half an hour JUST to place my order. Was it worth it? YES!\n\nFirst you pick a flavor, then you pick a base, and then your toppings and size. A small cup is around $6.\n\nI went the seasonal route and chose the green grape soymilk ice cream with no topping and although a recommended topping of strawberries was made I wanted it plain jane. I've never seen or heard of using fresh grapes in ice cream before and the idea of using it in ice cream didn't even occur to me.\n\nI saw about 1/3 cup of soymilk, & a cup of whole fresh green grapes go into my mixture.  They then take a hand blender to it before it's poured onto this below freezing ice pan where the base cream is mixed & whacked with extreme vigor until ta-da.......you get ice cream!\n\nGreen grape ice cream just sounded so unusual I had to try it. It was good! Top 10 good. It was so rich & creamy I couldn't believe it was made with soymilk. You get the taste of fresh grapes in every delicious bite. So refreshing. Felt healthy and sinful at the same time. One of life's many contradictions.\n\nIf you have dietary restrictions let them know and they are more than happy to make recommendations based on what your needs and likes are. That's pretty cool! I would definitely go back again and try something different."

Mind you, it was midnight, but I guess in Vegas that's pretty early. Anyway, the man was so full of energy and so nice! He explained all the steps to us on how to choose the ice cream and let us know that everything was ALL NATURAL. No added sugars, or dyes. The fruit were real and not added flavors. My almost 2 year old daughter happened to wake up and he interacted with her and made her smile, which is hard to do when she sees a stranger after just waking up. He reassured me that their ice cream wasn't bad for her at all and it's the healthiest ice cream you could get. \nI ended up choosing green tea with Lychee and it was so good! My sister got green tea with Mochi and it was also delicious and my fianc\u00e9 got mango with Mochi and chocolate syrup and he also enjoyed it. My daughter loved it as well. The man ended up giving her a king size Reece's candy bar(it's Halloween, remember?) and gave us 3 water bottles for the road. \nWe all recommend this place to anyone that wants a delicious treat in Vegas and will definitely be visiting this place the next time we are over there."

There's something a little more fulfilling being able to custom order your dessert and having it prepared from scratch in front of you.\n\nIf you're arriving by car or monorail, it's actually really convenient to get to. It's a short walk from the parking deck and monorail station. The ordering process and flavors have already been well documented on this page. If you have further questions when you get there, the employees are very helpful. The manager/owner steals the show though. If he can't bring a smile to your face, I don't know who can. He was so accommodating that he gave everyone in line and in the seating area a  free bottle of water.\n\nMy whole milk chocolate without topping was smooth, creamy, and a good finale to the evening. My wife had the non fat mint chocolate chip which I had a taste of and was delicious. It was interesting though because the natural ice cream did not have the classic green color. Will definitely be back to try more flavors."

I try to get Ice Pan whenever I'm in Vegas and will drag along any (un)willing family members with me. They were kind of hard to find my first time there since I'm not familiar with Harrah's and apologies for my horrible directions but I basically enter from the strip at the door closest to the southside of the strip by LINQ, walk on the pathway east through the casino and away from the strip, pass a small circular round-a-bout thing, until I see an escalator. Ice Pan is located right at the top of the escalator in Harrah's promenade area.\n\nI always get the matcha green tea flavor, whole milk, with mochi and strawberries mixed in. The green tea flavor is spot on and the whole milk makes my ice cream extra creamy. The service here really stands out! All the employees are happy to greet you, take your order, and offer any suggestions. I especially love the older korean guy(owner?). He's so happy and cheerful and really pounds away at that ice cream.\n\nIt's pretty amusing to watch the workers turn liquid into ice cream. They really abuse the ice cream with all that loud pounding, slapping, and beating. Some workers slap the ice cream around louder than others. I've seen other spectators waiting for their ice cream wince every time the ice cream got slapped back down so you've been warned! All the abuse the ice cream gets before consumption makes it more creamy and removes any air bubbles. Keep in mind they are making the ice cream from scratch so it does take some time and sometimes you have to wait a bit if there's a line. \n\nI think the way they make ice cream is a little gimmicky but regardless, they make great ice cream and the technique is pretty entertaining your first time here. I'd highly recommend this place if you're craving ice cream on the strip.\n\nPS to the owners: this is another gimmicky thing, but if you gave the option to make the ice cream into rolls like that thai ice cream roll video, I'm sure people would be willing to come try it."

It is a really cool concept but I wasn't amazed because I've seen so many videos on youtube and facebook about it that when I saw it I was like..oh yeah..this thing.  I went with a friend and I shared a small cup.  A small cup is about 2 scoops i would say.  I really wanted to try the fruit flavors..especially the green grape one..but my friend was into the chocolates and mint chip so we compromised on green tea.\n\nThe guy who made it for us was a newbie...he was so sweet and he was sweating trying to get the ice cream into the right consistency.  After 5 minutes he gave up apologized and got the more experienced worker.  I didn't mind that at all.  He was so nice and I felt bad for him.  Looks a lot harder to make than I though it would be.  You need to body slam it a couple times.\n\nWe got our ice cream and the first couple of bites were good.  The flavor is the same as other green tea ice creams, but the texture its different.  The ice cream is chewy and doesn't just melt in your mouth.  Maybe its because we got it with skim milk or something.  But I thought it was cool!  I liked it.  My friend didn't and after 5 bites she gave the rest to me.  I think its the flavor I got but I didn't really enjoy the last of it and just finished it because I don't like wasting food. \n\nThe concept is cool, a little pricier than normal ice cream but flavors are good.  Its a new thing and you should at least check this place out!"

My wife got banana ice cream with choc chips and walnuts, they smashed half of a banana into it during the mixing, tasted amazing. I got the vanilla with Oreo and marshmallow, it was also really good, the pan is so cold it froze the marshmallow.
