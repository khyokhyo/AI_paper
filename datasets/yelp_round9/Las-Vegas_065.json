            "review": "I visited India Palace when i came on an official trip to Las vegas. I ordered Paneer tikka masala and roti.Both were made with perfection. Tikka masala was their house special. It tasted great without so much cream( how they usually make in other indian restaurants). Roti was made in tandoor and it looked little burnt, but it was actually soft and good to eat. The ambience was warm and neat. The staffs were really friendly and very welcoming. Totally, i had a good experience with India Palace. I would surely visit again for tikka masala!!"

            "review": "Food is very good, the owners are great,     but The Manager was unprofessional.  He may no longer be there..    We ordered a Groupon   and called in and explained that we had a groupon worth $30  and ordered  some food to go.  I clearly explained my groupon... and there was no problem with the TO Go order from the employee on the phone who was polite.\n\n After driving 20 Miles.... we arrived.  The manager said the Groupon is for dining in only.  I said... why did they not tell me that on the phone... as I told them I had a Groupon.... anyway... he did not want to  honor the promotion.. then I asked him his name... and he wouldn't tell me his name... He said they don't make any money on the Groupon...\n\n I said...then why do you offer it?   .... that is not my problem.... I bought it... ordered. and then drove 20 miles... and now he is not wanting to honor the promotion.   \n\nDid you read the fine print ?  he asked..No I said.... instead, I called your restaurant and explained that I had a Groupon and they took my order.... and I in good faith came all this way expecting a smile and a thank you... and now I get a No.... and he was very  mean to me... disrespectful... not being considerate at all...\n\nOf course this upset me..... and I began to raise my voice..... Then he was upset that I raised my voice in his restaurant.... I told him... I did not come here to raise my voice... I came here for some Tikka Masala... but I will never come here again... trust me.....\n\nIt is unfortunate... that they have such good food here....yet... the Manager is a hothead, and I feel sorry for the employees that have to work for him.  The poor guy that took my order... oh my.... he is going to get the wrath!\n\nHe did not want to listen to anything I said.... In spite of it all I still tipped him $3 just because I am someone that has worked in the Restaurant industry, and I follow the golden rule... but I will tell you, this Manager was a real jerk.\n\nNow....there are  so many restaurants out there that would love to have a customer that drives 20 miles to come to them... and they will do everything in their power to make that customer feel special.  \n\nThis manager  threatened to call the Police on me... can you believe that?    Wow...\nIf he worked for me I would fire him so fast..... \n\nAnyway.... This is a good restaurant and they have good food... and I am sure the owners are good people..... They need to help their people understand the promotions, and then make sure that every customer interaction is  appreciated. \n  \nI really like the food... It is unfortunate that I have had so much grief here....  I blame the Manager... No CS skills whatsoever.... :(\n\nAnyway... I do think this is a good restaurant...\n\nThe owner call me up after this an apologized for the experience I had.  I thanked him for the call.   This is a lovely restaurant, and the food is fantastic.....I say go ahead and give them another chance...."

The next waiter couldn't decide whether to be nice to us or not. He smiled the first time and made snide remarks the next. The third guy was visibly relieved when we didn't order dessert. All this when we arrived well before time and someone else had just started ordering when we were leaving. The food was so-so. We ordered Dosa and frankly, there's a lot of room for improvement. Would not recommend going there. There are other better indian restaurants to go to."

Tandoori Chicken dinner $25.95\nfor $5 (Used the $15 groupon to get $30 credit, came out to $.49)\n\n- Seated right away. Fancy restaurant. Dim-lighting. Wine style cup glasses. \n- Edwin was a friendly server! He seemed to appreciate that we came in to eat Indian food and made sure that our drinks were refilled and the food made to our liking\n- They didn't have the lamb samosa tonight, which we were a bit disappointed so we ended up with the vegetable. Comes with 2. Cooked fresh and crispy. \n- You are given complimentary flat bread and 3 types of sauces, mild, med, hot. Flat bread tasted a bit burnt, but crispy. \n- Garlic naan was fluffy \n- chicken soup was watery but spicy. \n- Mango dessert was good. Tasted like Filipino fruit salad. \n- Fried vegetables were a bit smushy.\n- Tandoori chicken was a slighly dry and the onoins were grilled inconsistently, undercooked or overcooked.  \n- India Masala and Mint Bistro packs more flavor for my liking than India Palace, but nonetheless, still a good eat especially with the Groupon!"

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and all of the items I have tried have been delicious. Their lunch buffet is very reasonably priced and a great way for people who aren't quite comfortable navigating the full menu.\n\nThe uncomfortable feeling you experience when pulling up to this location will quickly subside once you get inside. The building itself is much nicer than it was when I started going five years ago.\n\nBottom line, I have not been to or heard of a better Indian restaurant in Las Vegas"

            "review": "This is our second time coming to this place and my last. This first time the waiter was rude but i chalked it up to maybe he was having a bad day. This is now my second time. I don't mind waiting for a table but when you do finally seat me and don't hand me any menus. At first I gave them the benefit that maybe they were super busy but here we go again same server and same bad attitude.\n\nI had to get up to find another worker to give us menus. And when the server finally came to the table to give us water I asked him for lemons and the mango lassi that I ordered. I waited another good 10-15 mins before having to get up and flag the server down to ask him for the lemons and drink\n\nFurther more when they never came back to check on our table or refill our waters. Throughout the whole meal and time we were here the servers were clearing the tables which is normal but the kicker was they didn't do it in a quite discrete manner they were slamming cups and plates down to the point where we could not even here our conversation. \n\nWhen we were finally ready for the to go boxes and the check we had to flag him down yet again and wait another 10 mins or so for the boxes and when receiving our check it was charged wrong. Big surprise. At this point there was only about 3 tables including us. And they weren't short on staff at all. \n\nAs for the food it's good but nothing that I can't get at some of my other Indian spots with great service! \n\nI think the only reason why this place has so many stars is because it is the closet one to the strip with nicer decor. But I would give up nicer decor for better food and service at a place that values there customers!"

Here's a tip if you offer a buffet, don't bother offering salad if all you're going to have is iceburg lettuce and canned fruit.  I'm glad they honored the 2-1 coupon for the buffet, and the service was polite and good."

There are only TWO suggestions I can make to management.  #1, please change the GOD AWFUL television playing on the wall.  It is like watching a Mexican sitcom.  They all look the same, everything is over acted and nothing is funny.  Well, the same can be said about what is on the TVs at India Palace.  #2, I like wine.  Servers at India Palace will cork the wine behind the bar and bring an uncorked bottle to the table.  This is a BIG NO NO in wine service.  See my review of The Broiler in Hawaii.  Anyway, visit this place.  The TV is terrible, wine is uncorked (wine faux pas) but the service and food are spot on!"

            "review": "The waiters could be more courteous and not have an expression that made me feel like I've entered a funeral home.\nBuffet items were bland and blah. Rotis were delicious. Nice ambience. \nMy gripe with this place just like most Indian places is the lack of spice and flavor in they food, for some reason the dishes lack the character of their Indian counterparts. In India the same dish will be extremely flavorful. My first mistake I guess comparing with the taste back home. But what's the point in calling yourself fine Indian cuisine if you can't be authentic and recreate the exact flavors??\nAlso, my mom without knowing the \"rules of the land\" asked for pickles, the staff were extremely helpful and got her a cup full of it and later slipped me an extra $1.50, when asked why he goes oh, if it's not on the menu then you pay. OK!!! why can't you tell her that first, instead of slipping one in, not that I had a problem paying for it, he is right, but the lack of customer service or ethics just irked me.\nBuffet is reasonably priced with enough items, improve customer service, remember it's the customer who makes or breaks your business. Improve flavor don't forget the roots of the dish. I know it is dumbed down to cater to local tastes but hey if I want to eat bland food I have lot of cheaper and healthier options."

            "review": "I and my wife visited India Palace yesterday.  After good experience on our last visit, we were surprised with quality of food served. Very disappointing.\nWe ordered combo appetizer, goat with spinach curry and chicken pasanda\n\nThe combo appetizer came without fish which was part of menu. The server served the dish minus  fish saying that he replaced fish with vegetable pakora. What he should have done is to return to us and say that the combo platter could not be completed and whether we would to order some other item or we would like  it as he wants to serve.  This was  poor customer service.  Cost $8:95/- Did not get complete order.\n\nRegards, chicken pasanda.  I have taken this food on many, many occasions in past, infact I grew up eating chicken pasanda. I've never taken chicken pasanda like the one served. It seems the chef does not know what chicken pasanda is and so does not know  to cook it. What is served something which they  call chicken pasanda, but not quite, this is unfortunate. Cost above $15/-. Don't try it.  You will leave frustrated\n\nRegards, goat curry with spinach.  To call this dish disappointing is an understatement.  The goat dish has 95%  bone and 5% meat, mixed with puree of spinach.  Cost above $15/-.  Do not even think of trying this dish.  You will leave frustrated.\nNo rice or naan was served with any of the above dish.  Poor customer service management.  \nI guess the moto of India Palace is, make money while you can."

            "review": "It's a rather sad thing that I don't frequent Indian restaurants. Being ethnically Indian, I should be galloping to the nearest Indian place to gorge on the curries and breads but I never do. The first reason is that for the most part, the Indian buffets or restaurants leave me with a very uneasy stomach. The second reason is that a lot of Indian restaurants leave something to be desired in the hygiene department. \n\nI'm happy to say that India Palace has somewhat alleviated my prejudices against Indian restaurants (esp the ones in Las Vegas). We went on a Sunday afternoon. They serve a lunch buffet (12/13 bucks) every day. The restaurant was packed! And it was quite well decorated...muted romantic colors, nice lighting...wow..a refreshing change from the usual Indian buffet experience. \n\nOne of my friends' went for the buffet which had about 10 dishes and a multitude of salads, yogurt dipping sauces and deserts. My husband has partaken in the buffet before and both of them had only good things to say about the buffet. \n\nAs I was feeling not too hungry, I decided to have something from their dosa menu. I ordered an onion and chili oothapam (thick pancake made from fermented idli/dosa batter. The batter needs to have a distinct sour taste and it is topped generously with onion/veggies or whatever you fancy). This was served with a Sambar and coconut chutney. The oothapam itself was pretty good and the Sambar although definitely not authentic traditional South Indian sambar, certainly tasted good. My friend had a paper dosa which was crisp and tasty and my husband had the mysore masala dosa (dosa stuffed with a spicy potato masala with some spicy chutney in it). \n\nI was pretty stoked to eat South Indian dosas in Vegas and have it taste good and be seated in a relatively nice establishment. \n\nThe service was a bit crazy..they had about 5 waiters/waitresses and no one was wearing any sort of uniform. All the wait staff were Indian and so were the customers...imagine my confusion and uncertainty when calling for service. \n\nMy husband also had the chai and said it was really good. He didn't leave any for me to try so I'd have to take his word for it. I ordered coffee...although not the traditional filter coffee served in South India, the combination of the coffee and dosa made for a very satisfying lunch. \n\nI'd definitely go back for their dosa offerings."

The flavor and texture of the dish was something I've never had before and I've been eating Indian food for a while. The atmosphere is great & open. Nice well stocked bar & Bollywood playing on several flat screens. I believe the  owner is the bartender & a Russell Peters look-a-like. LOL The night I came there was a bus load of Indian tourists but the restaurant was well planned in advance. Prior to their arrival I would say there was a fairly large amount of Indian locals so you know the food is good. The free mango lassi was a great compliment to our meal. Garry our server is awesome and attentive. He's been there for 7 years so be sure to ask for him to get the best service. All in all this place gets 5 stars and despite the area it was still a safe place to park and not worry about the surrounding area."

The renovations make it quite lovely inside -- used to be pretty drab.  We had the buffet and I had honestly forgotten how much it cost so was pretty surprised to get the bill:  under $25 for two!!  \n\nThe rogan josh is out-of-this world, but everything on the buffet is delicious.  The flavors are wonderfully blended and some of the dishes are moderately spicy but not hot-hot.  The naan is included which, as you may know, can add quite a bit to the cost of your meal if you order from the menu.  \n\nI've been to several other Indian restaurants in Las Vegas and India Palace has never disappointed.  My friend was suitably impressed and is looking forward to going there again on her next visit.  And am I being anti-PC to say that we were the only non-Indians in the restaurant that afternoon?  That speaks well of the place.  OH -- and if you have an Entertainment book, there is a coupon although it's not good for the buffet, but at $11.99, who needs a coupon?"

They have goat curry, which is total awesomeness. Their garlic Naan bread is the best I've ever tasted in my entire life. They bring it out all fresh too!  The staffs are SUPER sweet. \n\nI wouldn't eat dinner there though....especially if you are a girl... This restaurant is located at a pretty shady area.  If you really want to come at night, you should bring pepper spray and/or a taser with you.\n\nI also wouldn't come here if you're a vegetarian. The veggie dishes taste and look boring to me...Sorry. I focus on meat. \n\nParking sucks also. Don't park there if they have a truck there to restock their kitchen. Being the Asian female driver I am...I couldn't back out my car. So....a waiter had to do it for me. Yes. I know. Very embarrassing....."

It was pretty quiet on a Sunday night.  There were only a few other patrons, which is a shame because our experience at India Palace was great.  As other Yelpers mention, they are located near the Strip but on the border of a crappy neighborhood.  I wonder if they were in a better location if they would have more diners, but I digress.\nThey served papadum and 3 different dipping sauces when we sat down, which was very nice.\nWe started with the kheema samosas for an appetizer.  The shell was nice and crispy and not greasy at all.  They were filled with delicious ground lamb and green peas.  I thought it was wonderful with the date sauce (the dark brown one) on it.\nWe ordered the chicken korma and chicken tikka masala for entrees.  Both were very good.  The chicken was very tender.  The entrees didn't come with rice, as has been our experience at most Indian restaurants, so we had ordered a side of peas pulao rice and garlic naan.  I loved the rice with peas and nuts in it.  The garlic naan was also very good and not greasy at all.\nService was attentive and all the staff very friendly.  The restaurant was neat and clean.  There were TVs playing Bollywood which was fun.  They weren't on too loud and I always find it hard to not watch!  Our waiter provided us with containers to pack our leftovers.  If we weren't so full, I would have liked to try their dessert menu.\nOur dinner came out to about $60, including tax and tip.  Indian food is always a little pricey, so I thought it was good value for what we got.\nWe enjoyed our experience here and will definitely be back to try other menu items, the dosas in particular.\nThey honored the free mango lassi for checking in, which was delicious with my meal.

But when my husband and I brought her here, she ate so much she couldnt stop saying how delicious it all was. \nThe service has been super both times. \nWe will be back."

If you've eaten at everything around UNLV, you get tired of it so we were off. \n\nThe restaurant is in a shady area of town yet it's the only nice building so it's fine I guess. We were one of two groups of people in the place, apart from a table of servers which was weird, because it was lunch time. \n\nOverall, the food is good. Their goat isn't as good as Mint's but I still ate like a billion plates of it because it was still really tasty. Some of the breaded veggies were a little chewy but I assume that's because there wasn't a crowd there to eat up the food and have it rotated. They had some awesome naan.\n\nI got a free mango lassi with a Yelp check in. Justin checked in too but they wouldn't give him one because it was one per table, rather than one per check. It wasn't a big deal because it was (delicious) and big enough to share. \n\nThe reason this gets 3 stars instead of 4 was because when Justin asked for the check, we somehow were charged for a different table and it came out to more than $40 for two buffets. Justin said that his card had been charged for the wrong amount and that they needed to void the transaction. They told him that they couldn't give him a void slip and that they ran the card for the correct amount. He argued with them about now paying $60+ dollars for two buffets when the server threw the receipts in his lap, told him to call his credit card and dispute it and walked away in frustration. I went to sit out in the car while Justin tried to fix it. Super uncomfortable. \n\nJustin called his card and made sure he was only charged the correct amount. The food was good but the way the meal ended, I don't know if I'd go back."

For about $12, you get a solid variety of popular Indian dishes (Chicken Tikka, Tandoori, Veggie Korma, Dosas, Basmati, Naan, Salad, and Desserts... to name a few), which all taste pretty good.  I have had Indian food all over the world, so that's a definite compliment from me.\n\nAlthough the place was pretty clean and had decent decor, the service leaves some room for improvement.  The location is also a bit seedy, but understandable as it is on the outskirts of the Strip.  I also gagged when I discovered something that resembled a cockroach leg in my Masala.  After inspection, I'd like to give India Palace the benefit of the doubt even though I've never seen such a thing in the countless Masala dishes I've had; but nevertheless, it totally ruined my appetite... but not enough to not give India Palace a second chance.  \n\nThe lack of service and room for improvement on the curries (I have had better- Saagar in Newport Beach is a comparable place and is much better) led me to give 4 out of 5 stars."

I had originally wanted to use my groupon, but that offer cannot be combined with the lunch buffet. Instead, I opted for my sister to try some new dishes and determine new favorites. No fear about the unused groupon, next time I will return for dinner. Although I might have failed with my initial mission, the free mango lassi for my first check-in made up for it. The yogurt drink was a nice balance of tart and sweet. Really refreshing for the muggy weather we have been experiencing.\n\nWith the Fourth of July over, and done with, my meat intake had thrown me off balance. To offset the BBQ, no cuisine is better than Indian for when you feel like dining on good vegetarian friendly dishes. Did I choose to stay completely meat free? No, I could not resist a few pieces of goat in a curry sauce, a piece of tandoori chicken, and some chicken vindaloo. All of these dishes were fantastic. Nothing was overly salty or sweet. Instead they had strong herbal or spice accents that did not mask the meat. The cilantro chutney only intensified the sensations within my mouth. Now for the real reason why I love Indian food. The paag paneer was addictive and tasted wonderful with the fresh garlic naan. Nice pieces of cottage cheese were found throughout the creamy spinach mixture. The dhal curry was also a favorite. The complex spices in this yellow lentil soup is great over rice, or just eaten straight. Do not forget to help yourself to some kheer. This creamy rice pudding is thinner than the kind you will find in Mediterranean restaurants, but has slivers of almonds within. \n\nThe buffet is open from 11:30-3:00 for a reasonable $11.99."

I stick to lunch buffets as I don't really mess with dinner at most Indian restaurants; its usually just the same served a la carte at higher prices. \n\nPalace along with majority of the all the Indian restaurants in town is located in a somewhat shady area just north of UNLV. While the area might suck, IP is probably the nicest building in the area which helps a bit. \n\nGoing into a Indian lunch buffet I know exactly what I want to eat: chicken tikka (the boneless chicken chunks in the creamy orange sauce), saag (spinch dip with extra butter), samosas, rice and naan. Based of this, India Palace delivers a great lunch buffet. The food is refreshed regularly (frequency depends on how busy it is) and the quality has been consistent. My one gripe is that they never give you enough naan and make you wait when you request more.\n\nThe restaurant as I mentioned is pretty nice, recently renovated and is great for large groups or more intimate meetings but the parking is terrible. Service is average, they've messed up my check several times and I have had to call them out on it every time. \n\nRemember the yelp check in for a free mango lassie (only 1 per table wtf?) and the yelp deal!"

The chicken was perfectly cooked and the flavor was really, really mouthwatering good.  I also got the Basmati Rice, which was perfect as well. The cheese naan was worth it as well, very soft and fresh with great flavor.  I love the mint sauce that came along with it and the brown sauce was excellent as well.  I will come back the next time I'm in Vegas for business, I ate a bunch of high-end high-rated food in the resorts while I was here and this is what stood out the most.  I'm partial to this kind of stuff, though, but ultimately I'd love to try many other things on their menu after the awesome flavor and great quality of the food I had here this evening."

We are vegetarians so we just asked what the house specialties were and had a fantastic set of 3 different dishes. We did hear another couple raving about some of the meat options so I bet those are stellar as well. Prices were very reasonable and it was only a $15 cab ride from City Center.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and we're going back the next time we're in Vegas."

The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but don't let that fool you. This place is worth it.\n\nA few people I know used to not like this place because it was really dumpy. I never saw how it used to look, but the place was renovated a couple years ago and is quite nice now. Even the people who used to not like going there have returned. \n\nThe menu items are typical of what you will find at most Indian restaurants, however, they have a number of Southern Indian foods that I was not familiar with. One dish, the dosa, is something I would highly recommend to anyone. Essentially, it is a gigantic crepe filled with ground potato and onion. To give you an idea of the size, it's probably about 20-24 inches long, 4 inches wide, and an inch thick. If you want to make it amazing, you can ask them to include ground lamb. It's not on the menu, but for an extra few bucks, it's overwhelmingly worth it. It comes with two sauces, sambar and coconut chutney. I've never cared much for coconut, but everyone else always thinks they go well together. Paired with their naan varieties, you really can't lose. \n\nThe tandoori, masala, and everything else I've tried has been very good. Additionally, they have a lunch buffet for about $12 that's worth checking out. Overall, if you are looking for good Indian, this is somewhere you need to go."

When we walked in there was no one there to direct us to the buffet or a table so we decided to just stand in line and pick up our food after which we had to search for a table and sit ourselves down. We flagged a server and asked for water which came almost at the end of our meal.\n\nThe food did not have any flavor at all and we felt that we were just stuffing our stomachs rather than enjoying a meal. The masala dosa was uncooked, tandoori chicken bland and i cannot even define the taste of the butter chicken. Finally we decided that you cant go wrong with dal rice but that again was under seasoned and tasteless. The sweet dish mentioned a mangao custard but it felt like thick mango nectar that was sweetened to the point of being inedible.\n\nWhen the host was informed by one of our group members that the food could have been better he was arrogantly told that the food is purposefully kept bland to suite the taste requirements here. Well it is not about the spiciness of food but the taste that was non existent so we just decided to laugh and walk away."

It was a rainy night in October of 2010 and I had a Groupon half priced offer.  So I grabbed a friend and went.  He had tried Indian previously and knew to order the garlic naan.  Delicious.  He ordered Tikka Masala.  I ordered Chicken Sagwala.  Both were quite good.  I ordered mine with medium spice.  It provided that great warming sensation without being too spicy.  Though I did need some Tums shortly after.  The meal started with the aforementioned naan as well as something I can best describe as Indian chips and salsa.  Crispy little pieces of flat bread with three different sauces.  One was very strong with the red chili flavor.  One was heavy on the mint.  The third I recall as being sweeter and almost fruity.  All very good.  I was surprised at how much food I received.  I was very full afterwards.  I had to walk around the Boulevard Mall for a while before continuing on the my next stop (see my review for Hofbrauhaus).  After eating at India Palace, I knew I was hooked.  The flavors are intense but balanced so well.  I drive by some times when in the University neighborhood and I am always tempted to stop in. I am usually short on time and cash though.  In any case, the food was great when I went.  The service was okay.  The restaurant was clean and comfortable.  A good first experience."

You would never expect to find a restaurant so fancy inside from where these guys are located. They have a wonderful set up inside including a full bar that not many hidden restaurants have to offer. \n\nUpon ordering takeout...\nLooking through their menu, most of the entrees were ranging as low as $14. That doesn't even include rice or any other side dish, which is an additional $6. So I ordered the Lamb Curry with a side of rice and Garlic Naan. Everything was delicious and had the perfect amount of kick. To be on the picky side though, I have to complain about my Lamb being really tough and the pieces were just too large to be eaten. I had to cut every piece into 3 before eating it. Not to mention there were only about 4 pieces in the Curry itself. Like always with Indian food, I enjoyed the Naan the most by dipping it in the Curry sauce and downing it with the free Mango Lassie received upon checking in (which I \"forgot\" to redeem hehe).\n\nStaff was really friendly, greeted me as I walked in and sure love Yelpers that stop by to eat! They were all up on my phone when they seen the noticeable Yelp App. asking about what I was going to write about, it was funny lol. In the end i do have to say that prices were higher than expected for the quality and quantity of food prepared."

            "review": "Four people, table service; two who really know and love Indian food and two who love *this* place (though I am unsure of the breadth of knowledge on the cuisine itself). \n\nSERVICE:\n\nThe service was fantastic. Vick really took care of us and, having waited on my friends for the past four years, exuded a certain cameraderie that really brought everyone together. He made recommendations, made sure we wanted for nothing, and kept the meal moving forward without making us feel rushed in any way.\n\nFOOD:\n\nThe food was mostly good. Not great, but good. Tasty enough to share amongst friends over a couple bottles of wine, and some good conversation.\n\nThe paneer pakora (cheese squares made of 2 layers of cheese with some thin herb/veggie spread in between, then battered and fried) was disappointing. Maybe the squares are too big and cool off too fast; it quickly becomes a hunk of room-temperature fried cheese. It didn't make think of Indian food as much as any other fried cheese product around town.\n\nThe chicken pakora was much like the cheese; it seemed like any other fried chicken strip. The flavors want to be there, but it's just not executed well enough. Not impressed.\n\nThe samosas were really tasty. The crusts were flaky and the stuffing was generous and flavorful. Layered flavors, a great kick of spice, and the textures were good. A highlight, for sure.\n\nThe sauces (mint, tamarind, and chili) were fantastic! Really, really flavorful and fresh. We refilled our sauce dishes at least twice. Best part of the meal.\n\nThe chicken tikka masala was tasty. Not the best in town, but tasty. We ordered one medium and one hot. The hot was truly HOT... pushing the line of too much (and therefore hiding some of the flavors). Still, the flavors were good and the chicken was tender. \n\nThe peas pulao (basmati rice with peas and cashews) was pretty damn good, actually. I tasted a bite with a little of everything and really loved the freshness, the combination of flavors. Great complement.\n\nThe breads were good (my companions had to try at least four kinds?). I tasted a few small bits here and there and found them good. Again, not great. But good, worth trying.\n\nCOST/VALUE:\n\nThe apps and bread are priced well, especially for groups who want to get a few things and share. The entrees, however, are overpriced for what we received: appetizer size at entree prices. The tikka masala was tiny for what they charge and the rice was a la carte (also a bit pricey for what you get). Bad juju there, as your \"entree\" becomes a $20+ dish but it's just not a $20+ place. It wasn't my dime, but $200 for a group of four is a bit excessive for a place like this, even considering the wine.\n\nOVERALL:\n\n Food (and value of same) made me think it was a 2-2.5 (edible, but I have had much better...) but the service and atmosphere was easily a 4.5! So, a 3-star, A-OK experience. \n\nI *would* go again with my friends as they have a special affinity for this place... but I'll also take them somewhere else when it's my turn to choose."

            "review": "I had the buffet today. I don't think I can give a fair comprehensive review til I've ordered from the menu. Buffet is a different animal, ey? \n\nBut the buffet was damn good. I don't eat much meat, but I just drizzled the sauces from the meat dishes all over my rice and sopped up with naan (flat bread). I agree with the other reviews that the naan was a little burnt, but maybe that's intentional? It was still fluffy and I kind of like my foods on the charred side anyways. Adds character. The naan is not on the buffet line, but a waiter will drop it on your table, I'm assuming so it doesn't dry out under the lamps of the buffet. Nice touch, Indians. \n\nThe meatball sauce was awesome, on the sweet side and I went back for seconds and thirds. The saag paneer (spinach and cheese) was also good. But the paneer cubes were scant. \n\nThe Kahari Goat (house favorite) was a little on the salty side, but still good. On the dinner menu, this dish is $15. \n\nThe kheer (rice pudding) was good, too. Not too sweet, but still sweeter than others I've had. \n\nTheir samosas were okay (I like Samosa Factory's mo bettah). They offer a couple different chutneys. Cilantro and ... mango maybe?\n\nThey also served raita, chicken tandoori, aloo tikki (little fried potato chunks, like Indian tater tots), and mango custard. Everything I had was yummy. \n\nThey have a fat seafood menu, too, but no seafood dishes were offered in the buffet. At least not when we went. \n\nTheir dinner menu looks out of control good. I'm gonna have to go back. A lot. \n\nThe buffet had a really good variety for only $13. \n\nManfriend got a salt lassi, which was not too salty. $2-3. \n\nFor two buffets and one drink, the bill came out to $30. \n\nThe restaurant is in a free-standing building on Twain, east of Paradise. Dangerously close to school. Small parking lot. \n\nThe interior was surprisingly well-decorated. There's elaborate wood carvings and Indian illustrations decorating the walls. The walls are painted flat planes of colors, similar to Indian spices. The restaurant is pleasantly under lit. They don't just sport the name \"fine Indian cuisine\" for fun. Tables are elegantly set up with linens and all that fancy crap. Waitstaff is nicely dressed in uniform. \n\nThe bar is constructed with a solid dark wood and there's a large flat screen behind the bar playing shitty Bollywood movies, no audio. \n\nThe nice decor is surprising because most authentically ethnic restaurants are designed as an after thought. Like in old country. \n\nWhen we went in (lunch time on a Monday), we were only the second party. By the time we left, there were about eight parties. \n\n* off the strip, non-casino"

But somehow, India Palace managed to blow me away.\n\nI came in here to finally use a long-standing Groupon with Kris J before he moved out of town. We ordered Saag Paneer, Navratan Korma, and Chicken Makhani. If you know me at all, you know that I love my Butter Chicken! IP's Makhani failed to disappoint. It was creamy, tender, and oh so delicious. I'm so enamored by Butter Chicken, I feel like I basically ignore every other dish that the culture has to offer. I'm glad I had such an IP connoisseur with me. The Paneer and Korma--both Kris's selections--were outstanding! I'm not quite sure what it is, but there's something about IP's food that just ever-so-slightly sets them apart from the crowd.\n\nThe one weird thing about the visit? It seemed like we had five different servers waiting on us and they all lined up behind the scenes to take their turn to come over and ask if we had everything we needed. It's not a bad thing. It was just comical.\n\nI wish I had bought more Groupons now."

The lamb is tender and not overcooked like other places.\n       - Price/Portions - The prices are on par with other Indian restaurants but the portions are definitely a lot smaller.\n       - Locale - The restaurant is located in a pretty bad neighborhood and the parking lot is dimly lit.\n       - Decor - Though it might not look it from the outside, the inside is quite nice.\n       - Lunch Buffet - They have a lunch buffet for $11.95 which I think is a way better deal. Moreover, I wouldn't want to be in that neighborhood at night anyway.\n**Ordered**\n       - $14.95 Chicken Tikka Masala - Creamy and delicious, this curry is a must try.\n       - $15.95 Lamb Rogan Josh - The lamb was tender. The curry was a tomato base and wasn't as thick as other curries.\n       - $2.95 Garlic Naan - Your standard garlic naan, fluffy and soft.\n       - $3.95 Cheese Naan - They added cheese to regular naan. It kinda tasted like a cheese pizza, but better.\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd definitely recommend this place. However, if you don't mind which meal, I'd say go to the lunch buffet for a wider selection and a way better deal."

I tried the bhel puri/chana chat which is chick peas, puffed rice, onions, and potatoes tossed in a tangy tamarind sauce. This was very fresh. My friend tried the fish tikka which was also very good.\nI also tried:\ndal makhani-pretty good\nmalai kofta-yummy\nbhindi masala-it was good but very oily \nnaan-both the garlic and plain naan very light and good\ngulab jamun-yummy. this was very fluffy(not how gulab jamuns usually are so this was a pleasant change)\nI was told that the chilli chicken was good too.\n\nI would go and check this place out again!"

            "review": "India Palace is the best Indian Restaurant to my taste in Las Vegas.\n\nI have been going here for the past 8 years and have not once felt the food to be unsatisfactory and only once have I found one of the staff members to be difficult (He hasn't been there for years, however.).\n\nTo understand the reasons why they are the best would take me the better part of a book, so with the exception of a few highlights, I will encourage you to experience this food experience for yourself - altogether a more satisfying experience than reading any review!\n\nFirst off, since they are a ubiquitous and primary form of Indian Food consumption, I have to rave about their lunch buffet.  At about $13, India Palace will cost you that extra dollar or two over Mint (which is more Nepalese, if I'm not mistaken), Mt. Everest or India Oven, but not even Ghandi's excellent fare is close in quality and variety.  Every day there is a pilaf, lentils, Tandoori Chicken, a Saag dish, a Korma, a Tikka, a Masala, a Salad, both Mango Custard and Kheer, Naan and Sauces (Raita, Tamarind, Mint and a few others.).  For a vegetarian, this is one of the best buffets for you.  The break down always has at least 4-5 vegetarian selections in addition to the rice and lentils - most others are not nearly as diverse.  For the carnivore, the selection is by no means meager - at least 1-2 chicken dishes plus tandoor and a lamb or goat dish.  Alone, the spread is great, but, having eaten here dozens of times, I have to comment that the clencher for me is the fact that I can't tell a difference in quality between the lunch food and the dinner food.  This can't be said, in my opinion, of others.  \n\nSecondly, I find, despite the opinions of others, the dinner to be reasonably priced for the quality.  If you consider that Indian restaurants are usually priced well-above other non-European, Ethnic cuisines, it is easy to think of them as pricey, but the complexity of Indian curries and the time-to-cook makes them cheap if you compare them to a steak.  Also, if you consider the consistent quality of the food, India Palace is worth the extra buck you MIGHT pay over Bollywood or Mint.  Additionally, I find them to be cheaper than Tamba or Origin.\n\nWhat can I say, I'm a huge fan!"

I, especially, have been disappointed in the past by other local Indian places. This was wonderful, so glad we did it!\n\nWe weren't thrilled about the neighborhood as we drove in, but we've been pleasantly surprised by other great restaurants nearby. The exterior of the building is a nice modern look, and the smell coming over us in the parking lot - just amazing. The interior is beautiful, and the TV's playing Bollywood were kitschy, but fun.\n\nOur waiter was fabulous. Attentive, helpful, and great suggestions, but never overbearing. We ordered the appetizer sampler. Tasty samosas, great fried cheese, and the Bombay fish just blew us out of the water. Light breading, great seasoning on the fish, and just overall fantastic.\n\nFor entrees we got the Dal Lamb and the Lamb Rogan Josh. Both were phenomenal. The Dal Lamb is reminiscent of a chili dish with the lentils and kind of dark spices. The Rogan Josh was perfectly creamy and spiced. We ordered both mild, not knowing what kind of scale of heat the kitchen was on. These were REALLY mild. We definitely should have gone at least medium. Next time for sure! For sides we had the garlic naan and the peas pulao rice. The rice has so much in it, and was just wonderful, and the garlic naan was perfectly toasted. Both were great compliments to the entrees, and were suggested by the waiter. He had great taste!\n\nWe didn't have a dessert - we were so stuffed! We will be back again!"

I enjoyed it very much and wish I could buy it at the store\n\nWe started with the flat breads and chutneys..an Indian version of chips and salsa,!! \nWe had ordered the vegetarian samosas, lamb curry, aloo gabi and the fragrant rice!

I was like wth you need to chill! Anyways besides the server they didn't have a bartender a lot of items we were trying to order such as samosas and kabobs he said they didn't have any at the moment. So after that the food arrives the lamb taste spoiled and the chicken tikka was not all that. The chicken was over cooked and the flavors didn't melt in your mouth like it should. So after all this disappointment we look at our bill and realize that one little bowl of chicken tikka with literally 4 cubes of chicken was $15.95?!?!?!?! Oh and the garlic was neither garlicky nor buttery but it sure was burnt.  This is ridiculous. Bad and overpriced food with bad service. Oh and to make it worse there was a bug on the ceiling right above our table. Will not ever be coming back again. There are far too many good Indian restaurants in Las Vegas to come back here.

I also like their renovations, they've greatly improved the atmosphere.\n\nSad spots include burned naan, rather bland food, small servings of rice (with dinner entrees), and dirty looks from waiters when ordering mixed pickles and chutney (I have no idea what that's all about either).  \n\nI'd only recommend India Palace if you happen to be driving along Twain during lunchtime."

When we were being seated, the host told us a party of 50 was coming in, and that the back room might be quieter, which it was. The back room has 4 tables and is a nice intimate setting. Note, that in the time we were there, one tour bus full of tourists came in, ate, left, and another bus full was coming in as we were leaving. The bus loads of people appeared constant, and if we had sat in the main dining room, it might have been miserable. \n\nBut anyway. Everything we ate tasted really good. We ordered a goat dish, a lamb dish, and samosas. The veggie samosas were kind of bland, and only had potato in them, but tasted fine. When we ordered it was a little weird that the waiter asked us what kind of rice and naan we wanted, as if it came with our meal, when in fact it didn't. I've never been to an indian restaurant that charged extra for rice, so I thought that was a little shady. \n\nBut really none of that mattered, because towards the end of our meal, we found a hair in our food. A short, curly, kind of hair. We showed the manager. His response was \"do you want some more rice? I can get you some free rice to go? I'll take 10% off of your bill, mistakes happen, it probably came from the buffet.\" Um, number one, we didn't eat from the buffet, and number two, DUDE there is a pubic hair in our food. While I appreciate him taking a little bit off of the bill, what I would really prefer is for him to look disgusted, and go back to his kitchen and have a very serious talk with his cooks about hygiene and cleanliness. But I had the distinct impression that wasn't going to happen, and he just sort of acted like, oh these things happen sometimes. Maybe he didn't understand that this hair did not fall off of someone's head?\n\nSo, even though the food tasted good, and up until that point we had been having a nice time, I really don't think I can get past a pubic hair in my food. We won't be back."

It took a minute for anyone to greet us and then seat us. We were seated at a booth (which was showing quite a bit of wear & tear on the seats... the vinyl/leather was cracking) and given menus and then the host walked away. Our server came by and we ordered papadums and onion bhaji to start. \n\nThe restaurant is located off the strip and was pretty easy to find. They didn't seem to put a whole lot of effort into decor, but they have a couple TVs set up. In the back of the seating area, they had a buffet area set up, but I'm guessing its only a lunch buffet because there was nothing out when we went for dinner. It did look pretty sizable though. \n\nThey brought out our onion bhaji, which was alright but definitely not good or great. No papadums. We ordered 1 garlic naan and 1 cheese naan and our meals...I got chicken tikka masala and my boyfriend got tandoori chicken, asking again for papadums. So the server brought out 2 orders of garlic naan but no cheese naan. My tikka masala was not good and ended up making me sick. My boyfriend's tandoori chicken was over cooked & dried out. And still no papadums. I asked AGAIN for papadums and our server finally told us they don't have papadums, even though they have them on their menu. \n\nBetween the awful service and the OK (which is generous of me), I'm not impressed with this place. I won't be back, that's for sure."

The buffet had my favorite entree and dessert, all for about $10, which normally would have cost me close to $20 easily.  \n\n-Goat Karahi:  The meat was so tender and flavorful. Place a piece of this delicate meat on a piece of naan, add some white onions and a squeeze of lemon...what do you get?  Yummy yummy in my tummy!\n\n-Kheer: Traditional rice pudding made with basmati rice, milk, sugar & saffron.  I can eat 2 bowls of this easily.  So DeliCious.\n\nThey constantly bring out naan to you when your basket gets low.\n\nAside from these 2 awesome things that I eat from the buffet line, they also offer other dishes like the pakora, aloo gobi, chicken tandoori, and many other dishes and desserts (my friend had mango custard and she said it was very good...I vowed to try it next time by not overstuffing myself with the kheer).  Their menu changes though.  The other time that I was here, instead of the goat karahi, they had lamb vindaloo.  Instead of kheer, they had gulab jamun (milk cheese balls soaked in a honey syrup), which was a sad day for me :(.  I expressed to the server with a pout, indicating that I would much prefer the kheer.  Next thing you know, he brought out a serving of kheer just for me!  Yay to the awesome server!\n\nTherefore, if there are certain items that you like, you might want to call ahead to check out what's on their line.  Other than that, if you feel adventurous, please check this place out. I will definitely come back!"

The private lot was packed and we took the last parking space.  (There were still cars coming in as we walked into the restaurant.)  Could there be private event?\n\nAs I took a quick peek in, it didn't seem like it was closed for a party.  We took the last of the two tables available, which was our luck since the rest of our dinner there was a large group of people waiting.  Checking out our fellow diners, and we were surrounded by Indians and non-Indians.  This place was was ridiculously busy!  As a result, it took awhile to get our orders in and for our food to come.  It looked like a new restaurant inside with the simple decorations and complementing paint choices.  (As other yelper mentioned, they just renovated.)  A lone TV behind the bar showed Bollywood videos throughout the meal.  They also have two smaller rooms off to the sides.\n\nThe Husband and I both ordered a Mango Lassi \"Sweet yogurt based shake made with mango pulp.\" ($3.95) to start and it was probably one of the best I've had.  Presented in a copper cup, I would say they give you more than other places do.\n\nWe both chose a dinner special, which comes with chicken or dal soup; choice of bread - plain naan, garlic naan, or roti; basmatic rice and mango custard.\n\nThe Dal Soup \"A traditional veggie soup with delicately spiced lentils.\" was simple, but tasty.  A nice start to our meal.\n\nThe Garlic Naan was a generous amount, and we actually had leftovers.  It was tasty with lots of garlic.\n\nMy Vegetable Dinner Special included \"Saag Paneer, Navratan Korma, Dal Makhani, Raita\" ($19.95).  The Saag Paneer \"Creamy spicy spinach with chunks of homemade cheese.\" is usually a favorite of The Husband's, so I let him have most of it.  It was good, but not my favorite. The Navratan Korma \"Mixed veggies with cheese in a creamy sauce with cashews, almonds & raisins.\" was a favorite though, probably because I love creamy sauces in Indian cooking. The Dal Makhani \"Lentil delicacy flavored with onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic & cream.\" was also very good as well, because I love lentils and cream!  The Raita \"Yogurt seasoned with cumin, cucumber, tomatoes & mint.\" has never been something I could enjoy, so The Husband enjoyed most of it.\n\nThe Husband went for the Rack of Lamb Dinner Special \"Rack of Lamb, Malai Kofta, Aloo Matar\" ($25.95).  The Malai Kofta \"Cheese & vegetable balls in an aromatic gravy.\" was a bit interesting, as we would say.  It's considered a \"House Favorite\" but it was just a bit weird for us.  The Aloo Matar \"Green peas cooked with diced potatoes and aromatic spices in a curry sauce.\" was yummy, as most Indian curry dishes are.  The rack of lamb was also good, and loaded with tons of onions and bell peppers, which The Husband ate up.\n\nThe Mango Custard was a light simple liquid custard drink with chunks of fruit in it.  Not exactly what I call a custard, but more like a thicker lassi.\n\nService was okay - when our waiter finally took our order, the food took awhile and our bill took awhile too.  The women serving the food could use a little brush up on how to clear a table.  Simple things like clearing the soup bowls before bringing out the other food might help a bit.  We were seated at a small table, so it was crowded with all our mini dishes.\n\nOverall, India Palace served up some good Indian food.  In general, I love the intense spices used in Indian cooking, and you definitely get it here.  I can't say how authentic it is, but from the many Indians eating there, I take that as a good sign.  It is a bit pricey though compared to other Indian restaurants."

It is really authentic in taste.\n\nDecently priced and serves buffet.\n\nStaff is very friendly and good ambience.\n\nCons:\n\nFar from Strip, so for dinner, it would be a bad idea. Lunch is fine.\n\nLess number of varieties compared to other restaurants. The dessert could be improved a bit."

            "review": "First off this review is for the so-called 'Customer Service' here, so let me begin. \n\nMy friend and I had been waiting all week to finally come to this spot to try Indian for the first time.  I had read all the great reviews about the Chicken Tikka Masala and how good the garlic naan was so we were pretty excited about it.\n\nAs we entered we weren't really greeted politely, we were kind of looked at like we were lost.  I asked the waiter if we could have a table for 2, so he pointed and said booth 3, so we walked to the nearest empty booth he was possibly referring to.  We sat for about a couple minutes till the same waiter came over and said \"you're here for the buffet right?\" We looked at each other confused because it was our first time there so I asked him if we were able to order from the menu, he looked annoyed and went over and grabbed a couple menus and brought them over.\n\nMy friend and I were already set on ordering ourselves the Chicken Tikka Masala because of the great reviews and the garlic naan as well. We waited a few more minutes then a different waiter approached us and asked us if we were here for the buffet.  I politely said no we are first timers and not too sure what was being served at the buffet.  He then described all the choices, I asked if the chicken tikka masala was available and he had said no, I also had asked if the garlic naan would be available at the buffet and he said no they would have to make it in the back and bring it out.  He was really trying to push us to eat at the buffet but we were really set on trying the dish we wanted.  So he took our order of 2 Chicken Tikka Masalas and the Garlic Naan.\n\nI then asked about the free Mango Lassi you receive if you check in on yelp.  My friend and I both showed our check-ins, then he says that only one person per table with a coupon gets a free Mango Lassi (which was NOT stated on the coupon or app that it only applies for 1 person. SO if you're going with a friend or friends, be prepared that only ONE of you will get a free Mango Lassi if you check in here)\n\nDuring the time while waiting for our order no one approaches us and let's us know our food will be ready soon, or to re-fill our water cups or to check in on us at all.  \n\nFinally our food comes out and it's a pretty small bowl of the Chicken Tikka Masala, a few small pieces of boneless chicken submerged in like 5 ounces of their sauce and spices, but it smells delicious, then a basket of the naan which really wasn't much since we both shared two pieces each, and a bowl of rice to share between the both of us. (I thought per order of a dish you get your own rice, but I thought wrong.)\n\nFood definitely 5 Stars.  Being a first timer I was satisfied, but for the price of 2 bowls of chicken tikka masala, sharing a bowl of rice and an order of garlic naan (which came out to be a little over $20 each) I'm disappointed.  Not too sure if he had charged us the dinner price and gave us a lunch size meal. \n\nAll in all my friend and I both enjoyed the Flavors of Indian food for the first time, but will probably NEVER come back here again."

The spread was fairly good with Navarathan Korma being the definite star. It was creamy and flavorful with crunchy veggies. A close second was the chicken makhani as the chicken was moist. Some of the other offerings were good, but other than what I mentioned, pretty standard.  \n\nThe service is really friendly and very attentive so major points for that. Didn't need to ask for refills and plates were cleared right away. We were checked on often.\n\nI think I prefer this over the other much talked about Namaste, but it cannot beat Mint for me."

I think she may have been one of the owners. Just amazingly warm and friendly, wish she was our server the whole time.\n\nThe tvs and sound system were playing Bollywood music videos which was pretty fun! They do have a full bar! Oh and be sure to check in, we got a free mango lassi. \n\nOn to the dishes..\n\nChicken Tikka - Moist, fragrant, flavorful and oh so tender!\n\nChicken Tikka Masala - Big bold flavors, creamy and again insanely tender.\n\nMalai Kofta - Similar to the Chicken Masala though not as spicy. Balls of cheese and vegetable sitting in a thick creamy gravy. \n\nGarlic Naan - Lightly crisp with a nice chew this complimented our dishes with the ability to scoop up the amazing sauces. \n\nBasmati Rice - Another amazing vehicle for the more gravy laden dishes. \n\nWe'll be back!"

He is generally hesitant about dining out for Indian food because nothing can compare to his mamma's cooking- this restaurant was as close to home as it gets!!!\n\nWe are both vegetarians and loved that there were plenty of delicious options for us.  We had veggie samosas, vegetable biryani, red daal, saag aloo, and baigan bartha.  The bartha is rich and smoky tasting.  The daal was creamy and lucious.  Everything was spicy enough to get your taste buds excited but not so overwhelming as to make it painful.\n\nWe left with plenty to take home and snack on for the next two days.\n\nThe restaurant is clean and nicely decorated, we enjoyed the bollywood music videos playing around us.  I knocked off one star for service.  I dont expect good service at Indian restaurants and wasnt surprised with a service that was pretty much limited to throwing food on the table and bringing the check at the end.  They would also benefit from a fulltime bartender- while they had a full cocktail list I was hesitant to order from it doubting my waiter's ability to make a decent mojito.\n\nWhen the craving for a taste of home returns we will certainly be back!"

What a great idea it was and thanks to my fellow Yelpers for their reviews that helped me make my decision.\n\nThe restaurant was almost empty when I arrived at 12:30.  Service was excellent and I know it would have been even if there were a lot of people there.\n\nWhile I was looking the buffet over, the waiter brought me an iced tea as requested.  Shortly after returning to the table, another server brought me a basket of fresh naan.\n\nHere's what I tried:\n\nVegetable pakora - good but not a lot of spice\ngoat curry - nice spice and very tasty\nsaag paneer with cheese - flavorful with a nice zing\nbasmati rice - standard\nnaan - plain and good\nchana masala - excellent with a nice spiciness\nbhindi masala - this was noted as a house favorite.  I didn't think there was anything special about the okra nor the potatoes and it lacked much flavor\nnavratan lorna - good\nkarahi lamb - nice flavor and good spice\nchicken tikka masala - excellent\nras malai - excellent sweet to end this feast\n\nLest you worry that I cleaned the place out, let me assure you I didn't.  I took small portions of all these things just to try them.  Since I was alone, I had a great time watching the Bollywood Bang-Bang music videos on their TV screens.  \n\nI'm anxious to come back for a relaxed dinner with friends and enjoy being served and trying some things on the evening menu that don't show on the buffet."

At some restaurants, you get an extra sprinkle of chilli powder/paste if you ask for \"hot\" but this place actually integrated the spiciness into the food very well. I live in the bay area with a hundred options for vegetarian Indian food but this place has been quite a standout. \n\nThe service was also excellent, and that's why I don't have any hesitation to give it a 5 star rating.

I gave in and regretted it when the next course came, of course. LOL! \n\nWe ordered the rack of lamb meal for $25. Both of us decided to split it since we weren't super hungry.  Glad we did, because it was more than enough for 2 people.  It came with a nice lentil soup that I didn't eat much of because I was getting so full. \n\nThen the lamb came and it was amazing.  They had a few sides of rice, potatoes and these veggies balls in the most amazing cream sauce.  The even put some fresh naan on the side that was too good!\n\nLastly, they served a mango desert.

However, this place was quantity more than quality. The goat curry was really salty. Like really. It masked the flavor of whatever spices they put. The vegetable mikhana (veggie tikka masala) was off. Way off to a point it was sourish. However, the chicken mikhana, (chicken tikka masala) was actually tasty. I guess they cook it differently. The chicken was so tender it was shredding apart. I enjoyed their Palak Paneer as well. But the paneer was too tough for my taste; it couldn't pick up the flavor of the spinach and spices. Overall, I would not be able to fit this place into my rotation. \nHowever, service was great! My water was never empty and I was downing that water like crazy because of the goat curry. \nI went in on a Tuesday and they charged me 11.95 which is not right according to the information on this listing, or maybe they overcharged me."

While I like attentive servers, this guy was a little TOO attentive. It was almost like he was another dinner guest, he was always at our table. We appreciated the suggestions he gave us for starters but it felt a little pushy and too much like an upsell. The Shahi Paneer was pretty good (that's my standard order, some kind of paneer). The kulfi was good, but not as good as Mint. I may come back but there are a lot of great Indian places much closer to me, so maybe not."

It's wonderful hot crispy-fluffy naan, slathered with minced garlic and herbs, and I could probably just eat that and the curry sauce by the bucketful. It's not an additional price on top of the buffet, which is what takes India Palace from 3-4 stars for me. So garlicky and wonderful.\n\nThe buffet itself is pretty typical Indian-for-mostly-americans fare; I had the Aloo Gobi, Butter Chicken, a few curries, Goat Curry, and Bahji, which were all good, and I had no real complaints. Some of the chunks of chicken were those hard fatty bits, and a little bit unpleasant, but those are pretty expected in stews/curries/etc and overall, everything was great. The saag paneer stuck out as particularly delicious.\n\nThey were great about honoring the free mango lassi yelp check-in deal, and, since it was my first time trying lassi (I haven't tried one before because I'm not usually a yogurt fan, and I haven't wanted to spend 3-6$ on a drink I will probably not like, but hey, free is the right price to try new things).  So I tried a new thing and really enjoyed it. I can't say if it was good or bad in lassi terms as I have nothing to compare it to, but I CAN say I plan on trying more lassi's now so that I can find out. And I think that's a pretty good sign for it's tastiness. \n\nI will definitely be back for the lunch buffet, but I think I will need to try some of the other indian places around town before I choose my \"go-to\" dinner joint. The a-la-carte menu seems a little pricey around dinner time here, but the lunch buffet price is perfect for me."

After eating here my thoughts are:\n\n1) This is the only Indian place in Vegas--not likely\n2) People in Vegas have never had good Indian food\n3) People in Vegas don't know what good Indian food is.\n\nMy thinking is either 2 or 3.\n\nThe food:  An assortment of curries which all lack that usual tasteful magicness found in Indian cuisine.  The consistency was fine (I've been to some places that have real watery curries) but the blending of spices came out bland and not good.  The naan although fluffy tasted like burnt popcorn.  I have to say the one saving grace was the rice pudding (kheer) was actually quite good...I went back for seconds.\n\nThe atmosphere:  typical for an Indian restaurant.  My water glass was filled at appropriate times, they had pleasant light music playing (as opposed to obnoxious Bollywood videos), and the decor is fine.  I have to say I did not venture into the bathroom as I was afraid for my life.\n\nThe next time I am in Vegas I will skip this one."

Having heard the good reviews over the years, we decided to give it a try. I checked the yelp app on my phone and saw that with 'check-in' on the app you get 1 free appetizer or cocktail with purchase. The reviews were also favorable so in we went. We arrived at 5pm and the place was seemingly in between shifts so we were sat promptly. \n\nI noticed on signage that there were Happy Hour specials until 6pm so I asked the hostess about them. She replied, \"Happy Hour? Why not? .. You can get buy 1 get one free on appetizers. \" Great, It was about the same as the deal on the app so we ordered. \n\nWe had Veggie and Lamb Samosas, very nice as well as a few other items including garlic naan bread, Chicken Briyani, (Chicken mixed with Basmati rice with spices, cashews & vegetables) and Chicken Tikka Masala, (Tandoori white chicken marinated in yogurt & spices, simmered in a creamy tomato sauce.) Pretty standard stuff. We even opted for some traditional desserts and Indian Beer.\n\nAll in all the food was really good and tasty and I was very satisfied and full. Service was a bit off, but I think that may have been due to the language barrier, and sometimes the server would suggest an item, and then bring something else. In this case he offered a couple of different beers and then brought something altogether different. It wasn't a huge deal as the beers were good and 3 of us were sharing so they went fast.\n\nWhat was strange was when the bill arrived, I asked again about the Happy Hour specials, as the bill had not been adjusted. Our server was no where to be found and the server presenting the check had no idea what I was talking about. I got up to ask the hostess that seated us about the specials, (she was the one that said \"why not\",) and she acted as though she didn't know what I was talking about.. then reluctantly adjusted the bill. \n\nThe 'new' server brought over the adjusted bill and seemed pretty aggravated at me. Possibly for asking about the discount? I don't know but it was not a happy presentation of the new check. We paid and left. \n\nI would go again, possibly for a buffet situation, as I wasn't completely satisfied with the service, but the food was very good. I think at least one of my friends wouldn't return due to the service. We weren't asking much but the hasty and unhappy presentation of out adjusted bill kind of put us off a bit. Like I said though, we liked the food, so who knows :)\n\nYou should know that India Palace is on a very sketchy part of Twain Ave. It is literally always surrounded by police cars and as we pulled into the parking lot of the restaurant. No less than 4 police cars with sirens blaring were pulling 3 guys out of a car next door and had them pinned to the ground at gunpoint. I mention it, because I know the neighborhood well, and this has to be one of the less savory sections. I just wouldn't want a tourist to stop in and be surprised but commotions such as an arrest at gunpoint in a connecting parking lot.\n\nHappy Eating!"

My husband had to insist strongly a few times before the employee corrected the bill. \n\nDuring this process, the employee tried several wisecracks at  my husband, which of course he failed at miserably. The least we expect at a restaurant is courtesy and we do not put up with mocks and jibes at any cost. \n\nThe person who took our order and served our meal was very respectful and kind, so was the rest of the staff. \n\nWill not go back or recommend this place"

Purchased their $20 for $12 Yelp Deal and crossed my fingers.\n\nThe restaurant was located not too far from the strip but a little too far to walk. My companions and I paid about $15 each way for a taxi but it was well worth it!\n\nWe ordered the Bombay Fish and Vegetable Samosas for appetizers; both were delicious! The samosas are a little on the spicier side for those more sensitive to heat. \n\nFor our entr\u00e9es, we ordered the Vegetarian dinner, Chicken Tika Masala and Garlic Naan. Everything was exceptionally delicious! We had more than enough to feed 3 people and had remaining leftovers to take with us! \n\nFor lovers of Indian cuisine staying in Vegas, I highly recommend Indian Palace!"

We like that we could customize the spiciness of our dishes from 1-10, we chose a 3 and it was on the spicier side of 3 but all delicious.  The Chicken tikka masala which is usually our favorite dish was very very good, well spiced and great over the rice.  The rice was very fluffy and did not clump.  The garlic naan was fantastic!  The Bindhi (okra) masala was very good as well. Great wait staff and a good experience."

A friend and I happened to both want Indian at the same time, but having no idea where to go turned to my trusty Yelp app and it found this awesome place for me again! \n\nIt's tucked off in a little shopping area, but well lit and easy to find. It's got a great, cozy interior with roomy booths and Indian movies playing constantly. It has a full bar also!\n\nChecked in using my Yelp app and received a free drink called a mango lassi. I would never have known to ask for this had I not gotten this check-in offer, but I'm so glad I did. It was seriously delicious. It's mango and yogurt and it was part of the reason I couldn't eat all of my food. Highly recommend you get this fabulous drink!\n\nFor an appetizer we had vegetable samosas. They were dense and a little dry, but with the spicy cilantro sauce to put on it it tasted just fine. You get two and they're a nice size. \n\nFor dinner my friend had chicken tikka masala, which, while not outside the box is definitely a solid choice. He liked it and proceeded to eat all of it. I had the mata paneer and it was just the right spicy (medium) with a rich tomato-y taste mixed with peas and the paneer cheese. Had it over a bed of jasmine rice and it was super filling. One of my favorite dishes.\n\nAlso ordered a side of garlic naan which was okay. It wasn't the best I've ever had, way too much garlic, but it was find and went okay with the meal. \n\nThe service here can be spotty, I wasn't impressed with that at all, but it's not the worst I've had, so...\n\nAnyway, great food, nice atmosphere and at a reasonable price. Definitely recommend."

The chutneys were weird and it was hard to track down a server when we needed a drink refill or something.

All of that changed after my first experience at India Palace. To be honest, I've only eaten at two Indian Restaurants in my life. After eating here, I'm not sure I will venture elsewhere. \n\nSo on a lonely afternoon my wife and I decided to ditch our co-workers and meet for lunch. Fortunately India Palace had a Yelp dealio going down where you get $30 of grub for $20, a stellar deal. No restrictions were mentioned upon purchase, however when I presented the coupon the server said it was only valid for dinner. After explaining there were no restrictions mentioned in the disclaimer or at the time of purchase he graciously accepted the coupon and we enjoyed their lunch buffet with two refreshing pepsi-cola beverages. I'm a huge fan of their tandoori chicken, but the meal wouldn't be complete without their piping hot, freshly baked nan. I could honestly make a meal just out of that. My favorite item at the buffet is the Chicken Tikka Masala, which is tandoori chicken marinated in yogurt & spices in a creamy tomato sauce. It's 8:45am and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I even enjoyed a serving of their creamy spinach, Popeye would be proud.\n\nThe service at India Palace is always exceptional. The servers are friendly and attentive, your drink never stays empty for long, plates are whooshed away at lightening speed upon completion, and I always leave here feeling good about my experience and reminded as to why I've never gone to any other Indian restaurant. 5 glowing stars!"

We were staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and had our own rental car so decided to drive out to India Palace for a quick dinner. Unfortunately we couldn't even taste any of the food that the reviewers on Yelp raved about.\nWe made  an Open Table reservation and got to the restaurant on time. We were immediately greeted by a person without any expressions (no problem) and without any knowledge of what Open Table was (no problem here either). We were seated immediately............... AND THEN............AND THEN........ NOTHING.... FOR A LONG TIME NOTHING.\nThen came along our server. Brought the traditional Pappads and Chutneys and water and GONE.... AND THEN ... AND THEN..... MORE OF NOTHING.\nHe returned once again and without asking whether we wanted something to drink, he stated, \"So what do you want?\". We ordered some Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Seekh Kababs etc and ............. THEN WAITED...... NOTHING. NO ONE.\nAt that point I was done and questioning myself on leaving the fine dining available on the Strip and chasing this place out. We walked outta there angry and frustrated. Drove right back to the Cosmopolitan Hotel and had a Steak dinner.\nThis experience killed the whole desire of having Indian food in Las Vegas. The rest of the days that we were in Vegas we saw several options to have some Indian food however we second guessed ourselves and ate where we knew it was good."

I definitely knew that wanted to go to a place that would have more locals than tourists. After running through my list and seeing the great Yelp reviews, I finally decided on India Palace.\n\nWow, I was not disappointed! Started the meal off with the Vegetable Pakora and the Onion Bhaji. The Onion Bhaji, which are onions dipped in spicy batter and then deep fried, was amazing!!! It had the perfect amount of spiciness to start with, and when I felt like upping the spice meter, I just added a little of that really hot dipping sauce. I don't know the name of that sauce, but you know, the one that burns your mouth off.\n\nI went for my usual Chicken Vindaloo for my main course. Chicken Vindaloo is chicken cooked in a hot spicy sauce with diced potatoes, and of course, you can request the level of spiciness. I went for \"hot\"! To die for... it was sooo good!!! It was so spicy that I started sweating while eating it....yeah, that's some good shit! I gobbled this down with some garlic naan and cheese naan, and was quite full. I didn't even have room for dessert, which is usually required in my book.\n\nWhen I checked in, I unlocked a Yelp coupon code, which they pleasantly honored. The service was absolutely awesome! Nice, quick, and always a smile.\n\nWill be going back!"

Avoid non veg if possible. If I may say so there was a chicken starter seemingly labelled as tandoori chicken. Far from it. Most of the dishes seemed to lack any taste to it.

This is where I come when I'm craving my mom's homemade Indian food as this is the best place for North Indian food in Las Vegas.\n\nLas Vegas has several options, but if you're craving fresh North Indian food, this is your spot. It used to be a hole in the wall years ago, and a bit less pricey, but they've stepped up their decor big time and have a small but classy bar setup now. They expanded their seating space as well, allowing for large groups; call ahead and request one of their private rooms that can be curtained off (I would estimate it seats between 6-12 guests, depending on the room).\n\nYou'll smell your usual Indian spices in the air, making you hungry. Worry not though, while waiting for your food you have both the papad they serve complimentary and Indian music videos playing on a pair of flat screens.\n\nAnd when the food comes out, you will have no regrets no matter the choice. All around great food served in large portions. Of the 100 times I have been here, I have only literally had one bad experience. That's awesome.\n\nAverage vegetarian dish costs $13. Compared to other Indian spots in town (especially Tamba), this is a great deal for much better quality food. It's worth the trek from the strip!"

It seems to cater to locals and adventurous tourists and California visitors looking for good Indian food (like me). The area is a little run down, definitely not the pride of Vegas. Buffets are common in this town, even in off-strip restaurants, where even all-you-can-eat sushi is the norm. \n\nIndia Palace has been completely remodeled inside and out since I was last there a few years ago. I think that even the assphalt parking lot was new.  The new space is awesome inside. It's very nice and well appointed.  Trendy, somewhat techno Indian music adds to a well-designed layout with dark wood tables, cozy booths, and a nice central bar area.\n\nThe lunch buffet was great! Lots of veggie stuff to choose from. Little to no vegan though -- hard to find with Indian food since ghee and cream are staples.\n\nThey also must be paying attention to some Yelpers since the service was great.

The Goat Curry sauce was pretty tasty but all the goat meat was attached to chunks of bone so it's a bit of a pain and not so fun to have to extract actual meat. Goat is nearer to pork than anything if you've never tried it by the way - & not gamey like mutton can be...barf.\n\nKarahi Chicken was also worthy of getting. A nice tasting curry with various spices intermingling. I had mine done \"spicy\" but it still could have used a little more heat. \n\nI wish I could tell you about the Haryali Chicken but my soon-to-be sister-in-law didn't seem to want to share from the other side of the table.

Some dishes could be less greased with butter, but overall the food was good in comparison to mid-range Indian restaurants in the US - although it was priced higher than most in its range. \nThe wait was long as there are few tables to seat. Restrooms were absolutely a disaster with things overflowing with no attention from the owners. A common problem with most Indian restaurants like this one. If the food is good, the price is high - but no funds are diverted to keeping the restaurant clean for a clean experience. Where does all the cash go - not to the poor low-cost undocumented workers ????"

It did and was very tasty. He even brought me lentil crackers, since their bread was non-vegan. \nNice atmosphere inside, nicely decorated. \nFor my personal taste (shared by very few ) it was too salty, but my friends found it very much to their liking. I checked in for the Mango Lasi, but gave it to a friend bcuz it's non-vegan. My friend loved it.  \nIt is where it is, but you're driving, right? If you like Indian food, check this out.

The only problem here was using the Yelp deal ($15 for $30) -- perhaps it came at a point of confusion for the manager and waiters but it took a little bit for the deal to be honored. In the end, it was all fine. Just be careful to have your voucher information and yelp deal marked as redeemed to show them as proof."

You know when there's a limo in the parking lot, that's a clue.\n\nThey have an extensive menu, so we tried the Aloo Tikki appetizer, and it was four tasty fried cakes and very good. Then, we ordered the basic items we use to tell one restaurant from another.\n\nThe Lamb Korma is great, with more lamb than most others, and the lamb is very tasty and tender. There is enough sauce, so you can have just sauce and rice, too. Yummy. The Chicken Tikki Marsala is very tender, again with more chicken than usual. Very good sauce. The garlic naan is perfect. Very lightly crispy on the surface, and chewy inside, with a dusting of herbs for good looks. \n\nYou know, every dish here is pretty, too.\n\nThey make a firm vodka martini, and the recommended Taj Mahal beer was just right.\n\nGood service, very attentive, and \"Auntie Tarala\" will tell you with a lift of her eyebrow if you get it right. The charming manager stopped by to answer questions, and be sure we were happy. We were.\n\nSo you can have a lovely Indian meal,  at a reasonable price, without the noise and crowds of the strip, just 15 minutes away.in an easy drive. The parking is a free lot."

You have been looking for an Indian place that even SERVES dosa, much less has it on the buffet!!  Well, this is a blessing and a curse.  Masala dosa should be eaten immediately after it comes off the griddle, which does not happen at a buffet.  BUT if you can hold out til you see a fresh batch brought out, it's pretty good.  And the sambar to go with was super tasty.  (Bad news though, their coconut chutney has dairy in it.)\n\nThe server was very helpful pointing out the vegan-friendly dishes (pakora, rice, chana masala, cabbage, dosa, sambar, some salad stuff).  They will also bring you (vegan) roti upon request instead of naan.\n\nIt's an A-OK place; a nice change of pace from the usual trip across the street to Mint.\n\nOh, and meat-eaters - apparently you MUST try the meatballs and the goat.

The location is in a somewhat rowdy area but once inside you feel like your in New Delhi . \n\nOne thing the restaurant needs to work on is  better customer Service. It may be a  cultural difference between India and US but water refills , timeliness and politeness are what makes a big difference for the dining experience -- no matter how good the food and price ...\n\nOhm shanti"

Not too soggy and still had a fresh crisp at each bite. \n\nI didn't eat as much, but I was extremely full right away. I wonder if the myth about buffets is true. You know, the myth of putting something in all of the food that makes you full fast so you don't eat as much and waste any food? Well,  my stomach seems to think that the buffet myth applies to India Palace. It feels like I ate a whole roast pig. I just feel awkwardly bloated and full from eating a few vegetarian dishes. \n\nI am not sure if I would come back, considering that the lunch buffet is $11.99. The waiter also had poor listening skills.  The bill was \n$25.84.  My friend had $20 Cash and I had a card. We told the waiter to bring back $5 in change and put the rest on the card.  Simple enough right? \n\nHe put $20 into the bill and charged $5.84 on the card! Ay yay yay!!"

I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants in Vegas and California, and India Palace remains number 1 to me. This place is so. damn. good. \n\nAlso, just to throw this out there, I work with many Indian people, and they really like this place a lot as well. Take that information as you will, but, I think it's a good thing. \n\nI've been coming here for a very long time and I'm friendly with the staff. They are SO polite and friendly. I have always felt very welcomed here since the beginning. \n\nThe food, let's just talk about the food. It's amazing. My favorite being of course the chicken mahkani (butter chicken). It's easily one of my favorite things to eat, ever. They bring you naan bread to the table with an option of regular of garlic. Always go with the garlic, it's not very overwhelming. \n\nI also do the buffet every time I come here. I've eaten here for dinner twice and while I really do love the food, I feel their dinner portions are rather small when compared to the price. One of these times I used a Groupon and was never met with any kind of negativity, so it's weird to me that people are mentioning that. And as far as the rest of the service, I've never had issues with being neglected service or having my water filled, even when they're busy and hosting a party. \n\nAnyway, the buffet is great because you get a sampling of a lot of different things for a low price which is never a bad thing. \n\nAlso, I give it a 4 star rating because as much as I love the food, I really hate driving here. It's in a not so lovely part of town and the parking here is a nightmare when they're busy.\n\nTry it for lunch sometime, of course with a mango lassi."

Sure, it's kind of in a sketch area, but the building is nice - and once inside, the decor and food are just great. They play bollywood movies or clips on the tvs and it's fun to watch while waiting for our food. \n\nTonight our party of 4 was really hungry so we ordered our staples: vegetable samosas (2 for $4.50), garlic naan, basmati rice, matar paneer ($12.95); and 3 dishes we haven't had before: House Special Lamb Rogan Josh ($15.95), full Tandoori Chicken ($20), and Chicken Vindaloo ($14.95). \n\nWe're wimps so everything was \"mild\" spicy but still very flavorful and delicious, with plenty of leftovers to take home. I like to try different things on the menu each time we're here, but would definitely order the Lamb dish again - fantastic flavor and tender!! I only wish I had room for dessert when I eat here!\n\n I always come here with a coupon to make the meal an even better deal (ended up being $21/person including tax) and the waiter always have to be reminded to take the discount.

Even though there are a few on the west side of town, I always willingly and happily drive from summerlin all the way across town to eat at Cafe India. \n\nTheir curries are flavorful, well-balanced and have morsels of tender meat - everything I look for in a curry. There have been a few times they didn't quite get the spice level right but they are more than willing to bring you additional hot peppers or even take it back to the kitchen. The tandoori chicken is simply heavenly, very juicy and soft. Just beware that if you do have it during their fabulous lunch buffet hours that it might be a tad drier than if you order it as an dinner entree.\n\nAnd have I mentioned how great their lunch buffet is? $10 (I believe) and you get mango custard, lamb vindaloo (sometimes) and that spinach one that I really like.... and chicken marsala, tandoori chicken, naan, rice etc. Basically there's going to be more than what you can eat!\n\nTheir only downfall is their inconsistent service. Now it's not bad, but sometimes they can come off as brisk or they get very busy and it takes a while to be noticed. However, whenever that happens, their manager always noticed and would make amends, which makes it alright in my eyes. Besides, it's an indian restaurant and I'm sitting back, relaxing and not expecting things to be done as quickly as an American restaurant. When in Rome, do as Romans do!"

Yet the prevalence of Indian restaurants bearing this particular name is as longstanding and prolific as the consistent film career that spawned Kevin Bacon's namesake movie trivia game.  \n\nThe various elements sampled and experienced on my first time visit displayed a versatility much like the individual character performances that has made Kevin Bacon ubiquitous across the cinematic landscape:\n\nSplashing debut (\"Animal House\")-As a fraternity pledge that captured Hollywood's attention, the free mango lassi with checkin on Yelp will be sure to capture yours\n\nOver-the-top (\"Footloose\")- Like his rebellious city teen persona Ren McCormack, enjoy racy song and dance numbers with Bollywood films playing on an endless loop amongst TV screens in the background while you eat.\n\nSolid/reliable supporting actor (\"Mystic River\"/\"A Few Good Men\")- not necessarily the leading role like a Sean Penn or a Tom Cruise,  but the mini samosas are a solid appetizer with the right ratio of filling to dough enhanced with a few drizzles of tamarind and mint chutney. \n\nChillingly good performance (\"Sleepers\")- availability of chaat in the cold section of the buffet line \n\nOverdone (\"Hollow Man\")- As scientist Sebastian Caine, \"Yeah! If I die, pretend the last words I said were real deep and clever.\"  If I'm hungry, I'll pretend the tandoori chicken was not dry and overcooked \n\nLukewarm(\"Picture Perfect\")- a performance as uninspiring as the the saag paneer with an unattractive layer of oil floating on top\n\nRisky(\"Tremors\")- mixed reviews from critics regarding his role in this subtle comedy/sci-fi thriller, but reminds me of the risk one partakes in consuming the fruit in the salad bar since I'd be afraid of any underground postprandial \"rumblings\" within one's GI tract.\n\nRidiculous (\"The Air Up There\")- the presence of macaroni and cheese and chicken nuggets on the buffet line is as preposterous as the plot of this movie starring Kevin Bacon as a college basketball coach venturing deep into Africa to pursue a tribesman whom he discovered while watching a home movie...words fail.   \n\nIf you're a newbie to Indian cuisine, the fare at India Palace provides a good primer to classic Indian restaurant fare, but for a seasoned veteran, my top choices in town would still be Mt. Everest and Delhi Cuisine.   Kevin Bacon once summed up his career with the quote \"I think of myself more as a workhorse actor. It will be hot and cold and up and down, but no one will kick me out of the business\"  Pretty much sums up how I feel about this establishment."

We ordered some appetizers, some sabji, naan and MYSORE MASALA DOSA.\n\nThe waiter took our order and asked us if we want the sabji spicy or medium spicy. We said medium spicy would be good. So he brings everything from starter to the sabji and naan in order. The starters were okay and sabji was totally bland. We could easily say, since I have some cooking experience, that the mixed vegetable sabji was made out of frozen ready made cut vegetables, partially cooked and lacking all the spices that make it Indian. But we did not complain because we thought that it might be because we said medium spicy.\n\nSo, after we all but my poor friend who had ordered the DOSA, were done with our lunch, they bring the DOSA. The sambhar is sour like lemonade (we did not complain about it), but the MYSORE DOSA is full of red chilli powder. She, could barely eat two pieces of it. So, we call the waiter and tell him that we find it too spicy. He starts explaining us that we don't know what an actual MYSORE MASALA tastes like. And tells us that since we have not eaten an actual MYSORE MASALA in the city of MYSORE in INDIA we should not complain about it. So,  I informed him that I am from India and I have eaten MYSORE MASALA for more than 25 years and yes in MYSORE too and its never this spicy. He made faces and so I told him that its their mistake because they should have mentioned that it is very spicy in their menu. So, he got a bit scared and offered us some complimentary dessert, which we obviously denied and left the place paying for everything, with bad taste in our mouth."

We ordered Chicken Tikka masala and kadhi goat. .both were excellent. The food HIT the SPOT. I am going to sleep sooooo well tonight. I would highly recommend this restaurant to Indians as well as others..."

A little hard ordering because I had to repeat myself the same thing several times. Not a problem though. I actually consider that to be a good sign because it means it's authentic if the one on the phone must be the best speaker of English. After a little struggling while ordering I asked the price because the guy was about to hang up without saying it. All I ordered was chicken bartha rice and garlic naan. I told the guy I only had $40 so if they don't take a card, I hope it's less. He said, oh yes, no problem it's $30!!! Hey, no problem... Maybe it's actually worth it. Funny that when it arrived 45 minutes later in a small container with no receipt that the driver mysteriously had no change. For a cash only place, one would think the driver has change. Oh well, $40 for a $20 meal that was barely par level in flavor. Driver told me, \" next time say you don't want a delivery fee. \" Do you think I'm that stupid? Wow... There's not gonna be a next time! For a few extra dollars, people really know how to ruin a fair review. Although the portion was small. I found a clump of dried herbs in my mouth. Yuck. And really just OK but might be fooled into it tasting good if the driver wasn't so sneaky. And this is the highest reviewed in local area? No thanks"

Main courses were served in a tiny bowl. I got the variety platter. Sauce was filling as usual and good but the dishes skimped on the meat, which was disappointing because the bowl was already small. I wish the price could've been more proportional to the amount of each dish served. I'll try other Indian spots."

I highly recommend the lunch buffet if this is your first foray into Indian cuisine. My only quibble is that the dinner menu averages $15 per entree. A little high, but well worth it in my opinion."

Though I strongly recommend looking elsewhere for Indian food if you must go here check your bill.

Though I don't work in the restaurant industry I still have work tomorrow. \n\nAlso they took forever to take our order, then forgot what we ordered and had to take it again, and brought dishes out one at a time; cause maybe some people like cold food?\n\nEither way service being shitty, not the only place.

He said it was more special and flavorful than the regular rice.  It was good also, but I prefer the plain rice.  The naan was perfect as well (but who could mess that up?)  I am sad that it is so far away because I can't eat it often, but luckily I visit Las Vegas a few times a year and it will make it that much more special to anticipate eating it.  I will never hit the casino buffets anymore and opt to go to India Palace's buffet instead! Now that's money well-spent!!"

            "review": "India Palace has been voted best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas by The Zagat survey every year since 2001 and it has been described to me by Indians as the most authentic restaurant we have. I've dined there a handful of times to see if I agree.\n\nAlthough I wouldn't normally want to hang out on East Twain, one of the city's most dangerous areas, I will always take unnecessary risks for good food. The restaurant sticks out as the only kept up, interesting piece of architecture in that area, so it's hard to miss.\n\nYou will forget about the exterior surroundings upon entering as the decor is immediately welcoming. The walls are painted in warm, cheery earth tones that are beautifully complemented by heavy amber drapes and rich, dark woods. There is a comfortable full-service bar you can enjoy a drink at before your meal, making India palace stand out from many of its competitors.\n\nMy favorite thing to get here is the dosa, a thin pancake made from chickpeas. It is of such great diameter that it must be folded upon itself so it can almost fit on your plate, and it is eaten by tearing off more reasonably sized pieces. The only other place I've seen dosa is at India Masala in the Riviera (same owners, I believe), so I highly recommend ordering it here. You can have your dosa stuffed with an incendiary potato filling, or get the plain Papper Dosa, which I prefer (both $10.95). It is served with an addictive coconut 'chutney,' which is more like a coconut puree, and sambar, a tangy tamarind based soup/dip. Even without the accompaniments, the dosa serves as a fantastic vehicle for eating your main selections and proves to be an interesting alternative to naan.\n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala ($14.95) and Mushroom Matar ($12.95) are fantastic, but I think the chef's abilities stand out most in the Lamb Rogan Josh ($15.95). The tomato broth is reminiscent of an authentic, slow-cooked Italian marinara that has been spiked with exotic spices, and the flavors continuously evolve in your mouth, revealing the sauce's complexity. The lamb is perfectly tender to boot, and hasn't a hint of the gaminess that can come with lower quality cuts.\n\nSo, is India Palace the best Indian restaurant in town? I can't affirmatively say yes (I had a spinach soup that was inedible and they don't use many fresh veggies in their lunch buffet), but it is definitely a contender."

It reminded me of the best of Indian food that can only be tasted in the old streets of delhi, where they have been preparing such recipes for ages handed down the generations. This is what you get at India palace. I was awestruck at finding such sumptuous Indian food in Vegas.....Hats off to the chef. If you love Indian food or would like to try it, don't waste your taste buds at any just masala & curry Indian restaurant....But go enjoy the true preparation of Indian cuisine @ India Palace as you will truly discover the true indian food preparation that will take you on an epic food rendezvous. I had to wait and talk to the owner (as he was on the phone) to thank him for the journey I took (through those old streets of India) with every spoonful.....Keep it up. A true gem....found only in Las Vegas"

Not puffy & airy like I'm used to.\n\nSambar Vada:  The fried lentil donut had a very thick texture.  I've never this before, but I would've enjoyed it more if it tasted less dense.  The sambar had a nice flavor.  I don't think I could've eaten the donut without it.\n\nMom ordered the Tandoori Chicken dinner:\nThe chicken is less smoky and had less tandoori seasoning than other places.  (Those of you used to smoky & lots of seasoning will be disappointed.)  The white meat was cooked perfectly, but the dark meat was a bit underdone near the bones.\nThe dinner came with saag paneer (good), mixed veggies (spices didn't agree with me... something with a ginseng taste in it & I don't think they pulled the sinewy parts off the snap peas), and soup (flavorless).  The mango custard never came & we didn't bother to ask because we were too full.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Sagwala.  Well, for $14.95, you would expect to get more than just a few chunks of chicken.   The bowl was just slightly a bit larger than the side dish of saag paneer my Mom received with her dinner.   \n\nGarlic Naan:  good\n\nOverall, it was ok.  I would go back again to try the buffet just to see if they had a dish that could out do the dinner I had."

I, however had the lamb pasanda.  I ordered it with a spice level of 7 out of 10.  It came out perfect for my spicy taste.  It had a nice bite without overpowering the exotic flavorful blend of spices in the sauce. \n\n  All in all, we loved the food.  The service was a bit slow, even though there was only one other table of people when we got there.  The waiter also tried to change my mind when I made my entree selection, which was a bit annoying.  Apparently he thought a different dish would have been better suited to me.  The decorum was very nice, until you got to the tv hanging on the wall.  It kind of ruined the mood set by the lighting and the paintings.

Portions are small for the price and protein is minimal. Our $16 goat curry had a scant amount of meat and I found only four small chunks of cheese in my saag paneer. But the tandoori wings are amazing, with grilled peppers and onions, with lemon. But to spend just under $50 with tip for takeout for two? It's not great.\n\nThe buffet is their best deal. Good selection, variety of vegetarian options as well as multiple meat (lamb, goat, chicken) options. Service is attentive and friendly. Naan is included. There's even a small bar area and they appear to have beer and wine. I'm pretty sure you can rent this spot out for special events.\n\nAveraging my experiences together, I can't rave but it's kind of a gem for this neighborhood.

I would be pleased if they hired some armed soldiers with .303 Enfield rifles to stand at the doorway and of course in traditional Indian Army garb! Just kidding, but that is a part of Las Vegas that isn't a place to walk through at any time of day.\nWhat really surprised us was the immediate sense of peace and luxury when you stepped inside. What the hec?! are we in the Bellagio off east Twain?! Felt like stepping into a 1970 Ford Pinto and on the inside it's a 2010 Ferrari! Although we've been dining on Indian fare for many years, we still don't know the proper names of all the different foods, yeah Sag is Spinach, Naan is the bread and so on... but what we do know is that the food here at the lunch buffet at India Palace is probably the best we've ever tried in So. Nevada. The flavors were all a step above the competition, service was attentive and friendly. The buffet line is a bit shorter in length than the competition, but the overall quality far exceeds quanity. Naan bread is brought to your table fresh and not in cold piles in the buffet line. Overall a great experience and we have been converted. I'll even overlook the overly engergetic Bollywood videos they play behind the bar. Oh yes, I like Samosas, but no one seems to have it available very often, I do miss those."

Prices went up, I guess to pay for all the upgrades. Things went downhill. Last visit, about two years ago, we were disgusted when the waiter tried to scam us on the bill. Believe me: it was not a misunderstanding. It was a trick. Every Indian restaurant serves rice with the (already overpriced) entrees. Not here. Waiter asked if we wanted rice; we said of course. But when we got the bill, they charged us for an expensive rice dish, not regular rice. So we did not go back all this time. Went back again now, same thing. Tried to charge us for papadum refill, which every other Indian restaurant serves complimentary, like bread. Then, asked us if we wanted peas in our rice, which was a sneaky way of trying to upsell us once again. Then, when I confronted the server, he didn't try to listen to me at all. He argued and defended their policy, and said that's just the way it is. Then he told me he is the manager! When I told him every other place will include rice, refill papadum, etc, he said they were number one in Las Vegas, and he did not care what other places were doing. Personally, I don't care if an entree costs $10, $20, whatever. If I order it, then I pay for it, and it was my choice. But I hate to be nickeled and dimed. And obviously, I don't want to be scammed. So, I would never go back. I will inform everyone I know what happened (I am a local). I will blog and Yelp and let the public know what they are doing (BE WARNED), and how management is treating customers. Mint and Mt. Everest are FAR better choices for Indian food in Las Vegas. Goodbye, India Palace. Never, ever again."

The lamb tandoori always comes out sizzling hot to your table and the chicken tikka is always the right amount of spice and good portion of chicken. Also, we order Goat Curry but I wasn't too much of a fan. I usually don't step out of my comfort food when it comes to Indian food. Personal preference; if it's not Bryani, Tikka Masala or Lamb chances are I won't be a fan. Regardless though my out of town friends and family always rave about this spot when we stop by. It's always a go to for them. \n\nIf you want something spicy their scale goes from 1-5 order a 4 for some mild spicy and 5 for their medium spicy. We got a 3 and there was no taste of spicyness here. That's pretty consistent from my previous visits. However, they serve complimentary chili and dipping sauces with flatbread. A little of the green and red chutney sauces goes a long way. \n\nThe service is great though! The gentlemen are always full of smiles and check on their tables often. They were even kind enough to let us use two of the Yelp $20 for $12 deals. Probably because we had a really, really big to go order as well. The food was able to stay nice and hot and no spills on the joy ride home for my family to enjoy as well. It all came in a paper bag and was secured tightly. I mean that's really important when you order curry and you have a long ride home. \n\nOn your way out next to the toothpicks they have these seed looking things. I'm not sure what they're called off the top of my head but I will be sure to update when I remember. Regardless take a teaspoon full and eat it. It helps settle your stomach and it's a culture remedy for heavy foods."

East to West travel was completely halted across Las Vegas Boulevard South; The Strip. Not knowing this at the time of my order, we ordered. A little while later, Roy, the manager called me to tell me that the roads were closed. But instead of giving up, Roy personally went miles out of the way to bring us our order. He didn't have to and frankly most managers would have just cancelled the order and moved on. Not Roy. He went WAY above and beyond the call of duty to fulfill the order. And don't ask me how he did it, but the order arrived piping hot and DELICIOUS. Oh, and let's not forget the icing on the cake, because the order took longer than expected, he refunded me 30% of my order.

            "review": "For my Indian, I generally stick to lunch buffets, but this week a craving hit around dinner time, and when I noticed the Yelp Deal, I decided it was a perfect excuse to visit India Palace again. The environment is still nice with the added enhancement of MTV India playing on the TV screens, and when the complimentary chutney and papadum hit the table, my stomach did a little dance of joy. I thought things were going to be great. Unfortunately, the rest of the meal was moderate. The highlight was the friendly server assistant named Adam. \n\nI started with the Dal soup, and that really soured the meal. When it arrived at the table, it looked like water complete with little frothy bubbles on the edge. I gave it a stir, and the dal was there, but when I took a slurp, it also tasted like water. I rarely send anything back, but after my husband tasted it, he insisted. Oddly, the server came out to tell me it was supposed to be watery and perhaps I meant to order Dal instead, not the soup. To make a long story short: they brought out another bowl of soup, this time with less water, but with what tasted like a heavy helping of salt. I planned on just having it sit on the table, but the server assistant insisted on taking it off the bill. In short, this experience leads me to believe that when you order Dal soup, they take a serving of Dal and add water as that is how it tastes and appears. \n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the korma and chicken karahi and both were good. I thought the flavor of the korma was better, but I was not impressed with the variety or freshness of the featured vegetables. However, the chicken in the karahi was white meat and tender. We ate everything with roti, and while the first order came out lukewarm, our second order was piping hot and great. I recommend pacing your bread order to ensure the hottest, freshest serving!\n\nI also think it's worth mentioning that whenever our server interacted with us he gave me the distinct impression that he thought we knew next to nothing about Indian food, and perhaps we don't, but his demeanor made me uncomfortable for most of the meal. Adam saved the night for sure.\n\nThe end."

This place serves chicken masala in a bowl full of sauce and expects you to eat it without soaking up the sauce with rice. About halfway through my meal when I had little chicken and a lot of sauce left the waiter finally asked me if I wanted some rice. Little did I know at the time that the rice (barely enough for two) would cost an extra $4.....outrageous! I have NEVER been to an india restaurant that didn't serve their dishes with rice on the side. But this one seems to want to soak you for every dollar they can get. Decent food but at a steep price. I wont be back."

It made 6 of us feel like kings until we decided to have lunch buffet at this place.\nI ordered a \"plain lassi\" assuming it to be salted lassi and the old waiter assumed it to be sweet lassi and so i asked him to get me what i wanted. He came back really rude and said mean words while we had our food. My thank you was ignored and he made scronful faces instead. He got the check way before we were done with the lunch. And, eventually while we were leaving instead of a formal thank you, he passed mean comments. I was really offended. Such a bad experience after an amazing night.\n\n****HORRIBLE SERVICE ****\n****RUDE OLD STAFF****\n****BLEND FOOD****\n****WORST MENU****\n\nThere are much better indian buffet all over veags.

The folks here at IP know how to do it best!\n\nI had placed my order over the phone not knowing what to expect flavor-wise but following my motto of \"try something new every day!\" ... once I entered inside the restaurant was jam-packed which I took as a sign of great food!\n\nRicky greeted me, took down my name, asked if I had ever been there before and made me feel welcome. Although I was just ordering a variety of my fav appetizers he asked if I was using any of the discounts offered thru the app. I suggested that I'd save those for a larger order and he mentioned if I do use it in the future to ask for him for any additional discounts that can be offered!\n\nAlso, Ricky reminded me of my \"free mango lassi with check-in\" ... he was very prompt with their Yelp offerings and I appreciate that! After all that's how I found them. \n\nQuality and flavors of the food are easily 5 stars in my book! and I wouldn't hesitate to return in the future. \n\nThe only downside is that the parking lot is small and there were a ton of taxi cabs picking up & dropping off. space is limited but once you taste the food you'll understand why. \n\n\"hole in the wall\" establishments always turn out to be the very best! Try it today."

Everybody is warm and friendly and eager to have you as a guest.  I can heartily recommend India Palace to both vegetarians and carnivores alike.  I've visited with a large group of vegetarians and there were nothing but compliments.  So now the food:\n\nThe thing to start with, especially with a group is the assorted naan breads.  My favorites include Keema which is naan with minced lamb, Garlic and Poori which is fried whole wheat bread.  The naan rounds out what seem to some as small portions.  When you have naan, your entree of choice with the aromatic Basmati rice you have a very generous serving of food.\n\nNo matter what you order, I recommend getting rice as a nice complement to the sauces and curries.  I'm not a vegetarian, but enjoy the spices of the Channa (chickpeas) Masala.  The goat Saag in spinach and herb is delicious.  The meat is so tender and juicy it can best most steaks.  I can say that about the chicken and lamb as well.\n\nTo top it off, India Palace serves a great selection of beers from India including Hayward 5000, Taj Mahal and King Fisher.  I find Taj Mahal the most refreshing almost sweet tasting, and it goes well if you like your food spicy.\n\nBottom line: very attentive service, delicious variety, very tender, very juicy meats and Indian beer.  You can tell the ingredients are high quality and worth the upscale price."

The garlic naan here was the best I've had. The red chicken was spicy just the way I liked it. There's potential to be my favorite place but I couldn't, I only really liked maybe 3 or 4 of the items on the buffet.\n\nAt the time there was a free lassi with Yelp check-in unfortunately they only accepted one for our entire party but I got it haha. The mango lassi was good, great way to end the meal.\n\nThe interior is nice with many tables and a few TV's playing Indian movies. It seemed like a pretty full bar.
