            "review": "This was our first stop this past weekend.  We walked in, starving, hoping for some awesome cheap steak and prime rib.  \n\nThe place was pretty empty when we got there, around 4pm on friday.  \n\nServer was friendly.. I wanted the steak and eggs but its only available from 11pm-11am.. figures.\n\nServer points out the $8.99 sirloin steak special but says that i need a coupon which i can get for signing up for a players card... after some thinking, i decide to get the card.  Pretty easy, 5 minutes and i was done.  Anyways, the special comes with a 8oz sirloin, mashed potatos, green beans, a soup or salad, and also a beer.  NIce! \n\nGF got the $13.99 king cut prime rib\n\nFood comes out and my steak while cooked perfectly, is pretty tough.  The prime rib is also served as requested but i guess it cooked itself sitting on the plate because after about 3-4 bites, the pink color started to go away.\n\nPrime rib was definitely better than my steak.  Mashed potatoes were the best thing we had but probably cuz of the salty gravy.  \n\nOverall, i can see the hype but I wouldn't come out of my way to come here again... I was expecting a $5.99 steak and eggs as other yelpers mentioned."

They have: light, amber, heffeweisen, and stout. I always get the heffe which has bubblegum and clove flavors like a traditional German Heffe. I always get my hefferweisen with a lemon wedge instead of the orange wedge they serve it with because it just tastes better. Ellis also has growlers you can take home! Beyond that, the cafe has amazing food for cheap. The wings are good, the prime rib is AWESOME, the potato skins are good, the mozzarella sticks are good, and the philly dip is pretty damn good to. Also, Ellis has karaoke every night and it is always fun. Some amazing singers go to Ellis karaoke too!\n\nEvery time I have friends come in from out of town I always take them here."

In fact, my kids were so skeptical that they went with other menu items only to regret so we had to come back the next day. \n\nAlso went there for dinner two nights in a row for their $14.99 prime rib which also comes with a free 20oz beer.

When I say eat like royalty I mean huge portions of meat with sides. \n\nConsidering the price you are paying, it is not  fine dining quality food or ambiance. You're pretty much in a greasy diner, but hey just let that grease soak up last night's alcohol while you recover from the Vegas hangover.\n\nWatch out for wait times, especially during brunch, lunch or dinner rushes (that's a good amount of the day). Sometimes I feel like they make you wait so you're forced to play in the casino - don't fall for it! Just stand your ground and wait it out for that juicy heaping of steak you'll be getting."

I came with a friend after clubbing since we were starving it's seriously a great midnight meal and for such a great price too. $5.99 for steak, two eggs, potatoes, AND toast. I came around 3am and there were some people, but there wasn't a wait. The customer service was great -- the hostess saw that we weren't wearing jackets and seated us in an area where it was warmer (thank you!). The waiter came very quickly and we got our food relatively quickly. For $5.99 I was able to tell him how I wanted not only my steak, but also my eggs. It's also a pretty big portion I wasn't able to finish everything. \n\nEllis Island is a pretty small casino and it's definitely harder to spot if you're just passing by, but it's definitely a spot I'm going to be coming back to when I'm in town again. I would definitely recommend coming here if you're hungry late at night and looking for a cheap grub."

Waited 35 min to seat the two of us... And another 30 min for us to get our food(we ordered right when we were seated ) but it's worth the wait ...

They have a karaoke bar which was rocking the house down! Seemed fun but i was there for the food :-D. I was expecting a great 4-5 star experience, but sadly it couldn't make it.\n\nI am a patient person and I do not mind if the waiter is busy helping other guests, but the fact that the waiter consecutively did not acknowledge my presence made me sad. I was ready to order a beer but since my two friends ordered water, the waiter assumed that i would have ordered water as well and walked away :( . Once the waiter came back I asked him what selection of beer he had and if he had anything similar to Blue Moon. He mentioned some beer and he walked away again. :'(. I gave up on the beer and decided to try their appetizers. \n\nI had ordered the Texas chili cheese fries, and the potatoes skins along with the chicken fried chicken. The chili and the cheese did not look appetizing and smelled kinda funny. The meet from the chili stuck to the cheese and was very awkward. The potato skins were salty, and kinda hard. The chicken fried chicken was AMAZING, but i was getting full from the weird appetizers from earlier. \n\nAfter the main course we decided to order dessert. \"The Really Big Ice Cream Chocolate Brownie Thingy\" had immediately caught our attention. Sad to say, it did not live up to it's standards. There was ice cream, a brownie, and it did look like a thingy. \n\nOverall everyone has a different experience, but you should come out and try it out for yourselves. I'll just make sure the waiter KNOWS i am aware of them lol. :-{D!"

I was looking for a brewery in Vegas and found Ellis Island. \n\nI did not go into the caf\u00e9, instead my wife and I went directly to the bar where we proceeded to order $1.75 craft beers. That's a damn good price for anywhere, especially Vegas.  Their beers were good, I wouldn't say great, but definitely better than your standard mass produced you find everywhere around Vegas. The bigger plus is that when you are in the casino area and gambling, these are the beers you are comped! So yea, it's not as glitzy as the bigger casino's on the strip, but you get better beer! \n\nWe also had an order of the Bacon Cheddar Sliders. WOW. These were fantastic. They were juicy, full of flavor and cooked to perfection. If you like dry burgers or food that isn't messy, these are not for you. The juices (not grease) dripped off them when we were eating them, so you had to be careful not to get it on your clothes. Other than that, they where fantastic! We gobbled these up and if we had still been hungry, probably would have ordered another round. \n\nIf you like beer, or if you are on a budget or if you just want to step off the strip. I'd highly recommend hitting Ellis Island."

I ate two meals here and both were solid: chicken fried steak on one occasion and the fish & chips on another. VERY generous portions and stick-to-your ribs good. Another good option if you get before before midnight is the pizza; as with everything else in this place, it's cheap and good. And the $2 beer! It's the kind of Vegas value you don't see very often anymore. I'm definitely a fan and I believe it'll have to be a stop every time I find myself in Vegas.

You've got to be kidding me.\n\nEllis Island was a partner for our Yelp Spring Break experience, and so we came here on a Saturday evening to enjoy a night of BBQ, free beer, a hot dog eating contest, and live music. It's an unassuming place, with a patio that feels like a backyard, but Mike the owner made us feel welcome and was an incredible host. A limbo contest and small casino with low minimums provided more entertainment for our low-key night!"

They have $3 blackjack during happy hour.\n\nFood:  Very good restaurant in the casino.  Get a New York steak dinner with salad and a beer from $9!  All of the other food is really good, too, and very reasonable.  The place is also a brewery, and it is the best beer I can get anywhere.  But, be careful, it is strong.  Drinking four beers seems like drinking eight.  Best of all, the beers are $2 for a 22oz!  I love this place.\n\nThey also have karaoke, other restaurants, a BBQ restaurant (really good) and a pretty good players' club.  The staff is either really good, or basically rude.  In the restaurant you always get great service.  At the bar and casino floor, either the staff is really positive and helpful, or \"leave me alone\" and mean.  \n\nOverall I love this place and will go back every time a visit Vegas."

I can hang out gambling and if I get hungry I can sit in one of the restaurants or grab a good slice of pizza from the pizza counter.\nThe restaurants get really busy now.   Off the menu items are now advertised  and word of mouth along with sites like yelp have increased the restaurant patrons by a lot.  This trip is the first time I ever waited for a table here.  A short wait though.  You still can't beat the pricing for a sit down restaurant one block east of the  strip."

I've been here twice now after night clubbing and each time it took them forever to come out with our drinks at the beginning and to come back at the end to pick up our check. We were literally dying of exhaustion.\n\nFood wise though, the $6.99 deal for NY Steak and Egg is the best deal you can possibly get in Las Vegas! This casino is literally behind the strip (half a mile behind Linq & Flamingo) so it's not a very far off drive to get food after some late night fun. Your deal comes with steak, your choice of eggs, your choice of bread, and a side of potatoes. I've never been able to finish everything. My medium-rare steak was done perfectly this time, and the wheat toast was perfect with not too much butter. They do sometimes overcook your meat! Two of my friends' medium-rare turned out well-done but at least their eggs were really good...?\n\nAgain, service is not perfect and can be sloppy. Our orders were jumbled around and my wheat toast landed on my friend's plate instead. Easily fixed but definitely a mark off their service.\n\nAlso, they have karaoke here ... And some people just straight up SCREAM into the microphone. Yeah, sure, it can be fun for people in the karaoke room but maybe they shouldn't have set that up directly next to the cafe where food patrons are enjoying their meal?\n\nCASINO.\nLots of machines to play on. Table games, such as Blackjack, have ridiculously low buy-ins. The dealer my friends played against for Blackjack sucked though. Long-story-short, she f*cked up the rules and knew it but was in too deep in her argument to change it. So they lost and angry-gambled back on the strip to make up for it lols.\n\nOverall, I would only want to come here for the food.. It's ridiculously cheap!!! Even without the steak and egg deal! But otherwise, SKIP. Food cooking is not consistent, service may be nice but they're soooo slow ugh, and casino is not that great.\n\nFYI: it's not on the strip so taxis don't really pick up here. You can however ask them to drop you off and then request an uber/lyft! If not, just drive yourself here :)"

But only 20 minutes, AND it gave us plenty of time to sign up for the Players Card mentioned by other reviewers.  Spend $1 to get $10 in free slot play, plus discounts on their food.  The $8.99 steak and beer dinner was overall very good-- my boyfriend got the IPA and didn't care for it much (living in Wisconsin can ruin that for you), but the root beer was good and the steak was fantastic.  Potato was pretty good if you get extra sour cream and add tabasco :)  I don't like green beans myself so I can't speak to those. AND you get a salad or soup to go with it. \n\nThe waitress we had was efficient and polite, not overly friendly but I'm pretty sure she was waiting on pretty much the whole room so totally understandable.\n\nIn summary, it's an insane deal for Vegas. Take the walk if you're staying close by on the Strip!"

Now I came here solely based on everyone's photo of this $5.99 steak and eggs special. I was surprised to see that the menu said $9.99. I know the price hasn't shot up that much since most of the photos on here are recent. My wife and I were about to leave when our waitress informed us of the special. Later on I asked the waitress why it doesn't say $5.99 on the menu. Basically so they don't run out if everyone orders it which makes sense. So don't leave if you don't see it on the menu, just ask your server. \nI have to say the steak was outstanding. I was going into this thinking it was going to be a dried out, overcooked, tough steak. Boy was I mistaken. It was a flame grilled moist NY strip steak. I order my steak medium well and it was cooked perfect. I would border to say it was steakhouse quality. It came with toast, scrambled eggs and hash Browns and that wasn't bad either. It was the deep fried hash Browns and scrambled eggs so it's not hard to mess those up. But to get all of that for $5.99 in Vegas is crazy. \nI also talked with my waitress and she said they have some 4 course sirloin steak meal for $11.99 at dinner too so if you go for dinner, ask about that."

We had some time to kill before check-in at our hotel so we wandered over here for some quick gambling and drinking to get the party started.  The place is a typical, old, off-strip casino.  The vibe is old and stale but it's nice that it's off the grid and cheap.  I sat at the bar and asked if they had samples of their beer so I could try them all and the bartender basically laughed at me.  I settled for a house brewed IPA in lieu of having ALL THE BEERS and was asked for $2.  $2 for a 20 ounce beer?!?  HEAVEN!  And then I tried it...it wasn't a BAD beer by any means, but it certainly wasn't anywhere near hoppy enough to be considered an IPA for me.  There was just not much flavor and it basically tasted like an everyday lighter ale.  Would I rather drink a $2 house brewed craft beer, albeit without hops, as opposed to a shitty domestic for $5 elsewhere?  HELL YES.  But I definitely wouldn't make the trip back out here just for the beer."

This is my fourth time going, and I have to say, today was the worst experience I had, but I'm going to review based on what my usual experiences are.\n\nFirst of all, they really don't serve lunch items before 11, so don't bother rolling in, or you will not be guaranteed baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, rice pilaf, or soup :(...I showed up at 10:35 today, so you can see why I was sad.  \n\nAnyway, my husband and I always go there for the King Prime Rib deal.  For 12.99, you get a delicious slab of prime rib, with au jus, soup of the day or salad, green beans (which I think are very tasty), and your choice of a side.  In addition they also offer beer or root beer with your meal (ALL included in the price :D ).  You've gotta love that!\n\nI recommend getting the prime rib medium or medium rare."

The Wynn's 'Alex' gets the high rollers that flew in to Vegas on their private jets and are chauffeured around in limos.  For the rest of us, flying coach and willing to walk to dinner, The Ellis Island Casino and Brewery restaurant is \"the lamp beside the golden door.\"*\n\nThe restaurant is as no-frills as it gets.  They didn't even give it a name, it's just 'restaurant'.  Originally decorated in 1970s red vinyl, they know you came for the food - not to lick the walls.\n\nLike most Yelpers, I got the 6.99 steak special - it's not on the menu, but it's no secret either.  It was on the marquee outside.  Despite reading the (mostly) great reviews, I was expecting a sorry excuse for a steak.  What I got was a flame-grilled surprise.  \n\nThe salad led the meal and set the bar low - as iceberg with carrots, tomatoes, and crutons out of a box will do, but the entree quickly saved the day.  The steak was the quality you might make at home (assuming you can grill).  A little singed where the flame kissed it, but medium rare (as ordered) inside.  The baked potato came with sour cream and butter, another homestyle staple, but the green beans were good enough to be served in a $25 a plate steakhouse.\n\nThe wait was about 30 minutes, but you are in a casino.  You're not sitting on a cramped couch or standing in a tiny atrium with newspaper box and 2 gumball machines.  Head into the sportsbook and watch some tv, cheer with people at the craps table, maybe even gamble a little - I think they count on waiting patrons to lose enough money to make up for the low cost of the meal.\n\nSo who are you?\n\nIf you wish to \"Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp\"* then Ellis Island restaurant is a low 2 star joint.  If you are \"The wretched refuse of your teeming shore\"* and are not afraid of \"the homeless, tempest-tost to me\"* then Ellis Island (which is not located anywhere near the New York, New York Casino) is a solid 5-star facility.  I lie somewhere in between, but still give it a 4.\n\n* If you are a (non-native) American and are not familair with these lines, shame on you.  Go to the Statue of Liberty (on the real Ellis Island) and learn exactly why this country is great."

Around 4 pm on a Saturday, we were directed to the caf\u00e9, which was the wrong place in this tiny casino.  We found a long line next to the Brewery and pizza stand and so we followed the hungry crowd and waited.  \n\nI'm so glad we waited!\n\nMy brother got the babyback rib platter for only $11.99. This large platter included 2 corn ears, grilled sourdough bread, corn slaw, and beans.  I opted for the half chicken and half rack of babybacks for only $8.99.  This platter also came with the aforementioned sides.  The ribs were succulent, falling off the bone.  They rate up there with some of the finest ribs we've had at the Reno Rib Cook-off.  We also ordered their freshly brewed root beer, which was a sweet compliment to the spiciness of the barbeque sauce. \n       \nOnly paying a little over $20 total for what could easily cost more than $50 elsewhere, I thought we were being punked and we were ripping them off.  With the size of the platter and the quality of the barbeque at such a bargain, it felt like we were being comped free dinners.  Once we sat down, service was pretty quick.  There's also patio seating, which is overflow seating when the small dining room is full.\n\nEllis Island, which is off the beaten path of the strip, is now one of my top spots to pig out in Vegas.  I just have to make sure it's before 10 pm...when the brewery section closes."

The barbecue restaurant inside Ellis Island is AMAZING! For a very low price you get a half rack of barbecued ribs that are addictive (my mouth is actually watering now just from thinking about them), as well as the best cole slaw I have ever tasted, 2 corn on the cobs, 2 garlic breads, and beans. I don't like the taste of their beans. They really are quite nasty tasting. I think they should just use canned Ranch Style beans. I always ask them to substitute the beans for more cole slaw. \n\nThen there's another cafe inside that serves AMAZING prime rib at a low price. This prime rib is so good! And it's HUGE! Good luck trying to eat it all. \n\nThere are also other food places inside that look fabulous, but I haven't tried yet (I can't get past the ribs and prime rib).\n\nThey have their own brewery that all of their taps are hooked directly into. For $1 per beer, you will be amazed at how good it is. They also make their own root beer. I hate root beer, or should I say \"hated\" root beer, until my wife ordered a huge glass of it and insisted that I taste it. Now I order it every time I go there.\n\nThey have karaoke every night at 9pm. I love to sing, and enjoy watching the others go up and sing. It's set in a cozy bar with picnic tables. It's impossible to be antisocial there, as you are always sitting next to a friendly group of people who are smiling, drinking, and just having a great time. \n\nGambling at Ellis Island is way different than gambling at other places. Where else can you play craps or blackjack for only $5, day or night? Their dealers are fun and friendly. I've had Marilyn Monroe, Celine Dion, and yes, Elvis deal me blackjack, only to jump up on a stool and start singing hit songs. They're all really great singers and entertainers, but I have to say that Celine Dion is AMAZING! I literally felt like I was at a concert. \n\nEllis Island is a special place. It's right off the strip and usually filled with locals. They play excellent music, have exceptional food, and aren't out to take your money. If you lose money gambling there, you feel like you've paid for a really great time."

            "review": "We have been to Ellis Island many times over the years.  This is about our trip in February 2013.  I will touch on the Cafe, the BBQ and the Casino.  We have been coming to Vegas for over 20 years and spend plenty of time at the black jack tables.\n\nRestaurant's get four stars but casino only one star on this trip.\n\nThe cafe was great (as always) we both had the steak special. The salad was good and the steak was cooked properly.  The in-house root beer was delicious and dad enjoyed the micro-brew.\n\nBBQ was equally delicious.  We both got a full rack of ribs, our hotel room had a fridge for left overs.  They could do without the corn on the cob.  Why serve corn on the cob when you let it sit in a pan of water and it turns out soggy rather than crunchy?  They could roast the corn on the grill and have it turn out awesome.\n\nWe have played black jack in the casino many times.  They have good rules. decent limits and friendly dealers.  They have older pit boss who has been there forever, an older gentleman.  He always seemed less than pleasant and a bit offish.  We had an incident where the dealer misdealt and had to call the boss over.  He told her to burn the Ace.  the Ace would have helped my dad's hand and he would have taken the card whether he knew it was an Ace or not.  The boss said to burn it.  \n\nNow, whenever we have encountered something similar to this at other casinos (mistakes do happen) the boss would give the player the choice of taking or burning the card.  After all, it was the dealer's mistake, not ours.  When I spoke up (cause dad is 87) the boss rudely and gruffly said it's his casino and his rules.  End of discussion.\n\nAt that point we took our money off the table and left.  We will probably go back another day but we only play where we enjoy and have fun.  I had a rude pit boss at Foxwood's twenty years ago and have never been back.  Ellis Island is worth the trip but I won't play there if Mr. Happy is working."

            "review": "This review is for the BBQ at Ellis Island.\n\nA few tips: Despite the casino and cafe being open 24/7, the BBQ is not.  They are open Sun-Thurs 4pm-10pm and 4pm-11pm Fri and Sat.  Also, don't plan on bringing your children as it's 21 and older.  When busy, the hostess will give you a notification buzzer so you don't have to stand nearby.\n\nAs a local for the past 10 years, I've eaten the BBQ countless times and it has remained consistently delicious.  About three years ago, the BBQ was relocated from the other side of the casino to its current position; wait times have been cut way down.  This time I waited 45 minutes on a Sunday night at around 7pm with my party of three.\n\nOne aspect I appreciate here is the simplistic menu.  You have 4 options as my menu pic will attest to.  Thankfully, no complicated 10 page menu.  I personally always pick the combo option (half chicken/half baby back ribs).\n\nThe ribs are cooked to perfection with a delicious sauce that really adds to the flavor of the meat.  My only complaint (my personal preference) is that I cannot detect any smoke flavor.  Sadly, you won't see any beautiful pink smoke rings on this meat.  Frown.  The chicken is very tasty but have noticed it can be slightly dry.  Each entree is served on a very large black plate and includes 2 pieces of buttered garlic bread, an ear of corn (split in half), side of average tasting slaw and baked beans served with an Ellis Island based root beer sauce.\n\nI finally decided on a 4 star rating as the service, while consistently friendly, can be on the slow side and it can be hard to get refills on drinks.  \n\nBut overall, I recommend and look forward to going back."

I also really like the fact that these events usually include yelp and beer. I like that you can pony up to the bar, get an Ellis brew for cheap and catch a glimpse of some pretty entertaining karaoke all at the same time. It's also cool that they advertise in multiple coupon books. Las Vegas Advisor has $10 in free slot play, BOGO BBQ plate, BOGO entree, and my favorite one, 3  free rounds of drinks for 2 people. Score. They have similar deals in the American Casino Guide as well. Not that you need coupons to enjoy this place though. It's already pretty cheap, but free is awesome! Free + tip that is. \n\nWhat I don't like about this place is that it is an absolute smoke box. It's a small casino to begin with and it gets really crowded...with smokers. Which is why I enjoy the parking lot events, fresh air. The only restrooms are located in the rear of the building so unless you walk around to the back to enter, you still have to walk through the middle of said smoke box to make a pit stop. Dislike. If you are a smoker or simply don't mind that kind of atmosphere, then there really isn't much to dislike about this place."

Cue scene: Me singing and another venue and making new friends.  We realize that getting on stage again isn't going to happen, and inevitably, someone will say, \"Ellis\".  With nods, grins, and everyone quietly repeating \"Eliis\" in approval, I decided to follow everyone over there.\n\nI loved how small the entire place was.  What I loved even more was the pricing of the beer-- $1.75.  The first time I was there I got the stout.  It was alright.  I'm very stout picky and prefer the imperial variety, but it wasn't bad.  The next time I got the IPA.  I haven't moved on.  It's the one for me.  If you ask for water, it's a bottle for $1.  One night they hassled me about a minimum to use  my card, and every other night it's been fine... so be aware of that.\n\nThe books are huge.  They have ones by song title and ones by artist.  There are also many other songs that aren't in the books, so you can always ask.  Also, everyone is pretty friendly.  You can always strike up a convo with people visiting or the regulars.  My only issue is the queue.  Most nights I have gone tended to be from 30 minutes to 90 minutes to sing.  A lot of times  I've seen people get up 5-6 times while others have gotten up 2 times even though they have songs in... and it's not like the it was a quality of singing issue.  It actually upset some of the patrons so badly that they started complaining to me about it (like I could do anything) then the host.  Maybe the 5-6 time people were big tippers?  Maybe people were getting irritable because they had been there since 10 drinking and it was almost 3?  I'm not entirely sure.  Maybe I'm too easy going to care.\n\nWith all that said, it really is one of the best venues for karaoke.  And as with all music and music venues, you can't really appease everyone."

However, I have to take into account the antiquated decor and the ever present smell of cigars and cigarettes.  The dining room is very dark with red vinyl/pleather seating.  On top of that, the service can be slow at times.\n\nThat being said, I make it a point to stop here on every trip to Vegas.  Usually, immediately after getting off of the plane at around 10am Vegas time.  Upon first site, it really isn't much.  Ellis Island is hooked onto a Super 8 Motel; which in itself, doesn't exactly make you think of award winning micro-brewed beer and excellent food.  \n\nThis place definitely has the feel of \"Old Vegas\" when it comes to the $6 Steak (big) and Eggs along side a $1 beer brewed on site.  The menu is wide ranging.  You'll find everything from basic spaghetti to chicken fried steak on the dinner menu and slabs of ham the size of your head for breakfast!\n\nThe Ellis Island microbrewery is on site and makes a few excellent brews.  My favorite is the stout...and for $1 you can't go wrong here.  \n\nIf you're looking for somewhere cheap (because nothing else in Vegas is!) to start your trip while you wait for the 2-3pm hotel check-in time look no further.  \n\nOne last thing, don't make the mistake of having the \"Big as your head\" ham & eggs just before heading home...it makes for a long plane ride!!"

It comes with their own brewed beer, so you're basically getting a steak with your beer.  For the price, the steak is pretty good, well seasoned, and not chewy. It also comes with two side orders, so  you really can't beat that. Unfortunately, I can't comment on the other menu items, because I've only had the steak special.  \n\nSo, if you're looking for a cheap steak place, then make sure you give this place a try.  It's definitely worth it."

If it wasn't for him, I would have not dared venture here. \n\nUpon parking, it seemed like I was entering a seedy motel off the strip. It's on Koval Rd. off of Flamingo. Entering the place, there were old people smoking and drinking and a bunch of bikers. Sort of like something out of a movie set where they'd murder you and throw your body out in the dumpster. Scary...\n\nFinally found the brewery in the back and was anxious to try their half fried chicken and beer. What I discovered was fantastic! A whole half of a chicken was freshly coated and fried. So tasty and crispy! Came with some fries and a pickle. There was so much chicken I couldn't finish it all. Then came a 16 oz beer for...wait for it...under a dollar! You could pick any of their brews. I don't remember the name of the brew I picked but it was a tasty dark stout like brew.\n\nThere are other amazing foods on their menu, such as fresh sandwiches and hot entrees. All for under $10.00. My chicken plate was only $5.99! A super steal for a great meal. Don't be scared by the demographics of the customers here. The food and restaurant was nice and clean. No one mugged me or bothered me, and my rental car wasn't stolen in the end."

The only reason why this is not 5 star review was because of one particular person. But before i get to that, I would like to say to all the other staff, especially Rosie (our usual waitress), you deserve the 5 stars. Hell, i would make it 6 if i could. \nNow...\nDo you know what i love better than my steak and eggs....\nA nice talk about company policy. Because that's what i want to hear just before i bite into that  awesome steak i always order. Me and my wife have been coming here for some time now and never have we had a problem with our server such as the one we had today. It seems like this server was more interested in company policy than just hearing out an order. An order that has been placed exactly the same for the last 3 years. Now to be told that i can not do that, that I am wrong, seems like he was more interested in putting us in our place. Pretty much saying no to a customer rather than give them options. I will not say who this is because i do not wish to get anyone fired. But if you feel like this description fits you. Maybe its time to look into your customer service skills if you wish to continue working in the service industry."

Ever since my family started eating here, it has been the only place we go out to to specifically order steak, of all the places in Las Vegas. I usually order the Steak and Shrimp and it is always a meal that fills me up and has me looking forward to eating my leftovers, I have leftovers every time because the portions are great, especially for the price. The dinner salad that comes with a majority of the items on the menu is a salad I always crave because their thousand island dressing is to die for. \n\nTheir food is always freshly made and it's obvious that the chef put time in from preparing the food to plating. \n\nI recently tried their steak and eggs and fell in love. The portions were again, very big for the price, and the steak had great quality. The breakfast potatoes were light and crisp, and the eggs were perfect, and I'm not the usual egg eater. Even at 11 in the evening, none of our food tasted slacked.\n\nAs far as service, you can't expect too much coming from a cafe inside a casino. It was dimlitted and the hint of smoke is somewhat bothersome, but the food definitely makes up for it. Depending on how busy it is and what time it is, you will either have great service with the waiters constantly checking on you, or a waiter running around trying to do multiple things.\n\nI give this place 5 stars because it is a great place to eat if you want to get full, and I constantly go back looking forward to a great meal.\n\nI've heard the other restaurants in this casino are hidden treasures as well, but I have yet to try them. I would definitely recommend the cafe and swing by the sandwich shop as well!"

All the boys in our party heartily enjoyed this deal (what a steal) and I enjoyed some salad and \"spicy\" chicken fingers.  Whatever, it still tasted good, even though it wasn't as good of a deal.  \n\nFor Valentines day dinner, the restaurant offered an appetizer, soup or salad, lobster primavera, dessert and a glass of champagne.  Some of the ladies enjoyed this meal and were fairly pleased as well.\n\nThe worst part of this janky casino and brewery: the wait when we arrived was 1.5-2 hours.  The tables were not all full.  There weren't many people waiting in line.  Everyone gambling away their money?  We walked away for a bit, came back after some time (it's not that big in here folks) and luckily managed to get in without having to wait that long!  Score.

The salad was nothing more than a (as in one) cherry tomato, iceberg lettuce and dressing, my \"rare\" steak came out cooked all the way through and tasted like sawdust. No amount of A-1 would help get that thing down. The green beans were soggy. The only thing that was decent was the potato, but it would take some real skills to mess up a potato. The beer (hef) was a little too sweet for my taste, but it wasn't horrible.\n\nBad food is one thing, bad service makes it so much worse. I couldn't tell if the waitress hated her customers or her life more. She would disappear for long periods of time. Not that the restaurant was busy... There were only about 5 tables occupied. We never did get our bill.... 40  minutes after we asked her for it we just left more cash than we probably should have on the table and left.\n\n Please do yourself, your taste buds and your stomach a favor and eat somewhere else. If you are really looking for food on the cheap check out the dumpsters behind any of the better hotels. It'll probably taste better. Or go to. Mr. Lucky's and get the triple 6 deal. $6.66 for steak, shrimp and potato."

AT ELISE ISLAND OF COARSE! im a gigantic fan of country fried steak and its not served much where im from so i couldnt but help order it here. MAN WAS I IMPRESSED! i think they took the entire half of a chicken grilled and and neatly placed it on my plate! it was bathing in a rich white gravy sauce. it possible may have been swimming in it. it also came with a side of toast which was lubed in a sexy butter sauce, two eggs sunny side up to brighten up my day, corned beef hash (sunce im from hawaii) which were also in the form of disc and melted away in my mouth. and if that doesnt get you full theres also a pelethera of potatoes, like half a dish full to fill you up. \n\nAnother plus side is the price. i paid like 13 bucks for the entire meal. I think it was the fullest ive ever been for breakfast! The place was pretty clean. The lighting was perfect. especially cus i had a wee bit of a hangover from the night before. \n\nThe service was great. Constantly checking to see if \"everything is alright\" i love that question becuase it sounds like you could be in a situation where there is imminent danger when asked. Also my water was constantly being refilled and right after i was finished i was given time to let my tummy rest before being presented with the bill. \n\nAll and all this place gets a 5 stars for great food quality, excellent prices, and great service. If you happen to find yourself half broke after a fun night of drinking, gambling, and partying then you should definitly check this place out, for a temporary hangover stitch! :D"

Yeah, it's maybe not the best impression when you walk in the door: Uber-divey, with cigarette smoke laced with an vague, unpleasant, but (mercifully) unidentifiable stank. But trust me: stick around. Ellis is its own brewery, and you can get a REALLY good draft beer for dirt cheap. Play some blackjack. Play some slots. Watch the karaoke (or join in!), which ranges from horrific to Oh-my-God-this-person-should-have-his-own-variety-show fantastic. Then eat dinner (or, in our case, breakfast) in the joint's eatery: we got a NY strip and eggs for $5.99. And it was actually GOOD. Are you KIDDING ME?! Ellis Island is a MUST."

You want a decent meal without being ripped off. Go here.\n\n\n Ellis Island is a comparatively small property two blocks east of the Strip. But two blocks in 40*C is a bit too much to walk, so take a cab. You'll find a small, friendly hotel with the inevitable casino, with its own microbrewery, a comfortable restaurant, and The Village Bar, a hang-out for locals.\n\n\n In the restaurant, you can eat a substantial meal (all the American favourites) for about $10-12, and drink a pint of their own beer for $1 a glass. The Casino has less of an 'edge' to the house, for example 1-deck Blackjack instead of the normal 2 or 3 deck versions on The Strip. In the bar, you'll rub shoulders perhaps with workers who are refreshing themselves after a day of toil, and who are more than willing to chat about baseball or American football or politics.\n\n\n Outside, it's still 40 degrees, so ask them to call you a cab."

(who doesn't love steak and eggs at 4AM in the morning??) I started yelping stuff and we ended up at Gold Coast. Couldn't even find steak and eggs there! It was a TGIF (major fail and a waste of a taxi ride!) \n\nI yelped again and found Ellis Island so we decided to take another taxi ride over there. This place is right behind Bally's (where we were staying) and definitely walkable. Service was nice and the food was definitely worth the $6.99 (?) we paid for? haha that night is still a little blurry and I can't remember exactly how much we paid. But it was definitely comparable to Bill's steak and eggs (our usual spot). \n\nNow that we know where to go for late night steak and eggs in Vegas we won't have to waste taxi rides driving around looking for one. And the plus side is, they're open 24 hours!!"

When I first started going here, their beers were $1.

Get the ribs, they are slathered with delicious BBQ sauce and they are so tender that they fall right off the bones.  Huge portions!  The ribs come with sides (such as beans, sourdough bread, corn, etc).  I've also tried the chicken, which was also delicious.  \n\nIt's slightly off the strip but totally worth the trip.

But although I am rating this place 3 stars (that's a-ok folks, don't freak out), my husband and I usually try to make a stop at this off the strip casino whenever we are in town. Why you ask? Well one of the big draws for us is that low minimum at the blackjack tables and the fact that during the day, they use only 1 deck (so a better chance of gambling in our favor... hey, the house doesn't always win now). \n\nEvery time we have been here, the blackjack dealers have been very friendly and quite chatty (don't forget to tip them if they do a great job, especially if you are winning). And it is always a good idea to chat up the locals for some good restaurant suggestions (yes I know yelp.com should be the it spot for that, but in Vega$, wifi sure isn't free and also it's just nice to have some human face to face communication every now and then instead of just having my face in front of my phone or my tablet). \n\nAnyways, I think another major draw for others to come here is for the crazy cheap food they have here at the restaurant on site. The food is just average, but for the price, it's pretty good (but it's isn't healthy... yep, just had to bring that up... even on vacation I can't stop being a dietitian). \n\nThis casino does have that outdated look (old school/ vintage, Vega$ style) and definitely can't compete with the up and coming new hotels rising up in Sin City, but still has plenty of great things to offer tourists (and I'm sure locals)."

I usually hate listening to karaoke but I was amazed by some of the voices here.\n\n I've been wanting to check this place out for a long time because I've read a lot of great reviews about it on Yelp!

The food is average at best but I can't complain for $9.99. What was horrible was their service. Half the restaurant was empty and it took them nearly 40 minutes to seat our group because they couldn't figure out how to accommodate such a large group. We ended up turning two tables to make one big table and seated ourselves. At the end of our meal we asked for the bill to be split as some people ordered booze and apps. The waitress said it was impossible and could not be done. We asked to speak to the manager and they basically told us they won't do it because it's a waste of time. If we figured it out ourselves they would only split it in half. Never going back. The worst management I have ever seen."

All i could say is they've ruined my night and humiliated me in front of my everybody because i've told them how great this place was and the way it turned out cause of her performance was just complete junk. \n\ni was a server so i pay a lot of attention to how servers perform when i eat out, our server was an older aged white women which doesn't matter cause what matters is how they perform, but she FAILED in every aspect of a servers minimum requirement.\n\nhere's her problems\n\n1. wrong order (i could deal with that... who doesn't make mistakes?)\n\n2. smile, she had NONE! if you don't like your job, you could quit, your a server, your pay check don't mean anything... it's the tips you should be working for, that's where's the moneys at...\n\n3. refiling drinks, my water and glass of root beer was empty and she never came back to offer any drinks... how hard is that? do you seriously not know drinks, appetizers, deserts are the things that blows the bill up and get your more tips? or do you really enjoy working minimum wage?\n\n4. follow ups, which she FAILED HARD! she came to our table 3 times. \n1. drop off menu's and take order, but we weren't ready to order yet and turned shit face... fine maybe she had a bad day?\n2. ordering our food, she talks faster then a bullet train barely understand what she's trying to say. \n3. when she brought us our check, which we tried to flag her down and got ignored even she saw us. We ended up having to walk up to other staffs and ask for our checks, what is this? self service? \n\nBut she does follow up on the tables sitting next to us on the left and right multiple of times but chooses to ignores our table, and it better not be cause she's racist against asians.\n\n5. Another staff had to come up and apologize for her performance and this was his explanation \"cause it was busy earlier\". If you cannot perform and supply to the demand? maybe you should consider working some not so busy shifts or a not so busy job. Being a server that could perform is not easy which she totally failed.\n\nThanks to her i would not come back to this place again, getting humiliated once is more then enough. I also hope their management would reconsider on what shifts to assign to employees and make sure they could handle it.\n\nThanks"

This was the proverbial \"HOLE IN-da- WALL\" joint that serve $1.99 steak and eggs all day long.  They also had this drink called \"orange-ade\" ... orange juice and lemonade mixed together. Simple concept anyone can make but always taste better when someone else makes it!  They also had the $4.99 steak dinner.  WOW... for that price how can you go wrong, especially when you LOSE a lot of cash being a dumb-A$$ gambling.  \n\nBack to the food....Prices have gone up since the late 90's but this dinner special is still a GREAT deal for what you get.  They give you a GENEROUS piece of top sirloin, choice of starch, vegetable and soup and/or salad.  OH WAIT ... A beer or root beer comes with this fabulous meal for only $9.99. Cant go wrong with this!!!  I've actually tried more on the menu and the food is really good... one of the best places lil cafes in Las Vegas.  The \"Dinner Special\" is not on the menu but signs of the special are plastered all over the casino ... you just tell the server that you want the steak special. \n\nThe whole place is kinda cool. Its a casino/micro brewery that sell their draft beer for $2.25.. where in Vegas are you gonna get that.... ummm.. NO WHERE!!!  If you're not in the mood for caf\u00e9 food or Ribs and want a quick bite the have a Metro Pizza station. Check this place out... you might like it!!\n\nNOTE: Since being on the Food Channel or Travel Channel the wait for the Caf\u00e9 can be up to an HOUR sometimes but they have a really good BBQ joint mostly serving ribs and chicken."

Of course it's not Del Frisco's, McCormick & Shmick's or similar...but it is still way above par for the value.\nThe steak is perfectly cooked to order 90% of the time. The bread is bland...but on Tuesday's they always have Split Pea soup and it is EXCELLENT. Otherwise just stick with the salad. If Susie is serving that day, request her. Sweetest and hardest working gal in this town.\n*Note on service...to keep these prices what they are you have to cut corners somewhere. Servers typically have 5-8 table sections, and typically have 5-7 tables at a time...if you are in the industry RECOGNIZE this and have patience...if you have never worked in a restaurant, SHUT THE HELL UP and have patience.\n\nTHE BBQ: (Only available from 4pm-10pm each day)\nWith players card you can get a half rack for $7.99, a full rack for $11.99 and a half rack, half chicken combo for $8.99 (which is the best deal, but I hate BBQ chicken so stick with the full rack.)\nThese are among the best, and most consistent ribs in Las Vegas\nAlong with the ribs you get cole slaw (probably the worst on earth), garlic bread, corn on the cob, and baked beans (somewhat smokey and spicy to foil the rich sweetness of the bbq sauce.)\nThe service in the BBQ is a direct result of a constant 45 minute wait from the time. Think of this place like the Soup Nazi, except it's the BBQ Nazis...do not ask questions, you cannot substitute, they don't do to go orders, and they WILL skip you if you complain about the wait. \n******No one under 21 is allowed in the BBQ area****** So don't plan on taking the kids. \n\nThere is also a Metro Pizza inside if you don't like (steak or bbq) which has 2 for 1 slices on certain days (i think monday or wednesday or both). Not the same quality of the restaurants but still good if you don't want to sit down and wait.\n\nOTHER HIGHLIGHTS:\n$5 table games  \nKaraoke at the bar 7 nights a week\nvalue of the quality beer (Here again....it's not dogfish head or similar but a great value.) My favorite is the Amber.\nAlthough it's small they still have a sportsbook\nGreat frequent player program with lots of small prizes and giveaways nightly\n\nTo sum it up...if you are staying at a 5 star resort on expense account this is probably not your place (unless, like me, you like to slum it) But for the locals and those looking for the great deals around town give it a chance...it's dirty, the people aren't exactly supermodels and they are often grouchy....but it has no pretense and it always delivers what little it does promise."

            "review": "I actually kind of love Ellis Island, and we go often, but I have to be honest in the review and 3 stars is probably the best I can do for this place. \n\nWe always get the steak special, which is 8.99 (with your players club coupons that you print out from the machine) and includes a huge beer, steak, potato, green beans and soup or salad. Usually it is great, but unfortunately it can be fairly inconsistent. My husband and I can order the exact same thing and our steaks look completely different and one can be medium well and one can be practically raw. 80% of the time, it is a great dinner, but it's that 20% that bums you out sometimes. Also, my daughter ordered the fried chicken once, and while 3 pieces were perfect, one was raw inside...obviously that is fairly dangerous and something that shouldn't have happened. \n\nI will say that we have brought all out of town family here, and they all love it, rave about the good deal, and the beer, and always want to go every time they come out, so there is something about this old school place that people (especially the old people) are drawn to. \n\nMy favorite thing about the whole place is the beer. I LOVE the Hefe Weiss. LOVE IT! It is dirt cheap or free if you get the steak special. Also, I find the more Hefe I drink the less I care about the bad stuff about this place ;-)\n\nAs everyone has said, it is extremely smoky. I find the restaurant to not be too bad with the smoke drifting in, but the casino and bar are bad! We have watched karaoke in the bar, and my throat hurt for a day afterward because of all the smoke. Also there is one bathroom in the whole place and while I have never had to wait in line, that walk feels longer and longer as the night (and the beer drinking!) go on. \n\nSo I would say if you are NOT a foodie, like a super cheap meal, and can deal with some cigarette smoke, you will probably enjoy this place. So many of the strip casinos have gotten so over-priced and pretentious, that it is nice to have this place as an option when you just want something cozy and old school."

There is no need for a happy hour here because a pint of beer will cost you $2. Mixed drinks ran from $2-$3.50. The mile high nachos ($8) were more than enough for three people. Scoops of chili, a pile of beans, sporadic sprinklings of jalapenos and scallions makes for a filling appetizer. \n\nSlight misunderstanding about chicken fried chicken and fried chicken occurred which started souring the night. Our server was getting frustrated with our large party and was not trying to hide it. Due to the dispute, slight arguments were springing up. After reading Nelson Q.'s review, I stuck to my request for fried chicken. It came out crisp and the batter was not too thick. I hate cake like batter and this was thin and flaky. I asked for the honey, but realized that maple syrup was what I should have got. :( This is not the best place for large parties especially if cash is not in hand.

It probably has to do with the fact that it is a small, hidden place a block away from the strip. There was no wait at all, unlike Bill's, where we usually have to wait 10-20 minutes to get seated."

It's older, the casino is smaller, they've got the dark maroon and mahogany decor.  Strolling in and ordering the unadvertised \"gambler's special\" was really a kick for us.  The food was good - - the salad and rolls weren't much to speak of but the rest was very solid.  \n\nI tried their amber ale which was meh.  It's a little lighter than a true craft amber but still good.  I am a huge beer snob and their stout is GREAT, it pairs nicely with the dinner.   Overall it's an A+ joint!"

With your meal, you can get a free root beer, but our sweet waitress let us have cokes instead.\n\nDefinitely would come back here. Maybe not at 4am just cause some of the people there seem slim shady.

That cutie behind the counter tossing the dough in the air? Yes, he caught my eye. LMAO! He may have been the reason I bought a whole pie right after I just ate some ribs and chicken from the dining area next door. lol JK! He wasn't the reason, although he was easy on the eyes.  \nOkay in all seriousness, (hehe) Metro pizza is one of the best pizzas I've ever had in my life... Real talk. Thin crust, melt-y velvety cheese, crispy pepperoni and mushrooms that were just mushrooms. haha. There is something about their sauce that just had a BITE to it. Nothing like I've ever tasted before.. very yummayyy!  I loved how they sprinkled pepper on top the pizza too.. totally complements the crispy crust. They don't skimp you on the toppings nor do they overload it.. Whatever they are doing to their pizza they are doin' ittt rightttt..  these guys knowww pizza. \n\nThe BBQ restaurant is separated from the main cafe.  Honestly, my sis and I were too hungry to wait 45 mins. for a table there so we got a table at the cafe.. After finding out we couldn't get ribs at the cafe we got up and decided to just wait it out.  It was worthhhh the 45 min. wait.  They only have 2 items on the menu.  Chicken and Ribs.  We all got combos.  It came with 2 pieces of garlic bread, side of beans, cole slaw and corn on the cob. I don't remember the prices, I'm thinking it was about $16.99.  That's like a super deal.  They give you half a freak'n chicken and half a slab of ribs.. I was a bit hesitant about getting the chicken because most of the time, BBQ chicken is dry and a chewie.. But did this place prove me wrong.  My bf never eats chicken breast but he loved it.  It was so moist and juicy. Amazing.  Ribs pulled off the bone easily.  Sauce was perfect to my tasting.  Not too heavy and thick..  If your a fan of rootbeer, try it here.  They brew their own beer and rootbeer. :)\nI can't say much about the service.  There were only 2 men working the rest.  Seating people, taking orders and serving food.  They checked on all their tables when they had a free hand.  Very friendly guys!!\n\nI'd hate to let the secret out.. it would be a shame if this place were to be flooded by tourist and such, I'm sure Mr. Elvis wouldn't appreciate it. haha.(If you've been there, you know exactly who I'm talking about. Sweet man.)  Will I be back?!?! MOS. DEF.. OVER & OVER & OVER AGAIN."

It is a ghetto ass place and doesn't try to mask it...it is what it is and that is an off the strip,  \"old school\" Casino with no bells and whistles.

He recommended that we try this place that was just a block off the strip, called Ellis Island. It has a deal for a steak dinner and a pint of beer for only $6.99. So we gave it a shot - I was really impressed! The place doesn't look like much from the outside - it's across the street from an abandoned parking lot. The deal is not actually written in the menu, but there is a picture of the meal on the front. First, the quantity of food is staggering - the dinner includes a soup or salad, steak, potato, green beans, and a pint of beer. The quality of food was actually pretty good, too. I really liked the cream of broccoli soup - which our waitress told us is made from scratch daily. My steak was pretty good, but a bit tough (though another person in our group ordered his medium-rare and really liked it). Mashed potatoes and green beans were also good. The beer was actually pretty impressive - the place is a microbrewery, so they offer their own ale, stout, hefeweizen, and root beer. Between the five of us at the table, we happened to order one of everything. The stout was really good - very smooth, the ale was also nice. If you're not in the mood for alcohol, the home-made root beer was soo tasty. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place!"

My problem is that no one seems to know or care how beef should be served cooked to order. I have ordered Prime Rib or the Sirloin here around 9 times in the past two months. I normally would order Med-Rare. But after 4/5 orders delivered over cooked (twice I received fully Well Done end cuts), I decided to try ordering Rare. It worked one time, the other two times it was closer to Medium to Medium-Well. Tonight I ordered the Prime Rib Rare, you can see in the picture what I received. This piece of meat is on the border of Well-Done. It's a pure crap shoot here. Ive seen lucky people at tables next to me get their food as ordered. I've seen a bunch of people send the order back. You would think that the cook, server, or hostess would know the difference between Rare and Well-Done. But they either don't or just don't care.\n\nAnother interesting experience....Ordered the Prime Rib to go, told the hostess to make sure that I received Au Jus and Creamy Horseradish in the to go bag upon ordering. (my previous 3 to go's did not include this, even though it comes standard when you order at table). Go to pick up my order and no Au Jus or Horseradish in the bag. Nicely asked the hostess to get me some. After a few minutes she comes out with 2 Au Jus and no Horseradish. Nicely explain to her again that I wanted Horseradish too, she seemed not to understand, I said it several times. She comes back with 4 packs of Relish. Yes, Green Pickle Relish. Manager was standing there when she came back as I had this WTF look on my face. She fetched the Horseradish..\n\n\n\n These people need some serious training and quality control."

The waiter was nice when I asked about the $8 steak deal and told me the process that I had to go through. Since we were already seated and it'd be a hassle to do it.. he said he could just charge $10 and do it without me having to get the card and what not.\n\nCons: Took a little while for the food to come out, but it was a bit crowded and the place is understaffed. The place is pretty small in general including the tiny packed casino. Can't complain about the quality of the food because the quality outshines the price any day anywhere... umm.. nothing much really..\n\nBottom line: Cheap good eat. Go here. No I really mean it.

If you open a new reward card with them, you'll get a chance to spin the wheel to see how much you'll get on free slot play. The range is $10 - $500, but I think everyone just gets $10. The machines are good for this small casino. They have some of the newer machines that you'd find on the strip. \n\nWhen we finally sat down, we placed our orders. I enjoyed my steak and eggs. I wasn't expecting anything fancy for $5.99. I also ordered some orange juice and coffee (the orange juice was awesome! freshly squeezed).

I've been here before and knew what to expect...and was ready!\n\nEllis Island is a small casino on Koval and Flamingo.  It's a little outdated but busy with locals and tourists.  The casino is a little smokey and the carpet makes the place look dated.  The restaurant in the casino is no different.  Dark maroon booths, wooden tables and lots of printed carpets.  The one thing I can appreciate is the wait for a table.  There's always a wait.  Tells me that this place is worth checking out.  On this visit, our server was a little creepy.  He kept winking at us and stared us down, but in the end, hooked us up big time.  \n\nFor dinner, we got the steak dinner (which is not on the actual menu...it's on their secret menu!)  for $8.99.  It's usually $11.99 unless you have their players card.  Although the card is free, we didn't have one, but our server actually gave us the discount anyway.  That's how he hooked us up!  This meal comes with a thick cut of steak, mine cooked medium rare, choice of potato, I chose the baked potato, and garlic green beans.  This meal also comes with your choice of their in house brewed beers.  I chose the light beer, equivalent to a bud light.  The steak resembled a filet but only the look!  It was still delightful and a thick cut of meat.  Juicy and cooked just the way I like it.  The baked potato was just served with butter and sour cream.  Where's the chives?!?!  I loved the green beans.  Seems blanched with nice sized pieces of garlic.  Super good.  The beer was refreshing and perfect for the meal. \n\nThe one thing I love about my best friends in Vegas is the fact that they are so humble about the places they frequent.  They've turned me onto this place and the rest is history.  In my opinion, it's almost a five star.  I just can't give it that, as the places I've given five stars to before is in a whole other league.  Trust me though, I will be coming back to this place over and over again.

Heard about it from a cab driver one Vegas trip, and we have been back every time since.\n\nLocation wise, it's off the strip a bit, but parking is generally not a problem (though again, only been here when it's... late), and I've also managed to hail a cab standing on the side of the road at 3am.\n\nOur server was really patient with us, even though we had a big group. Service was surprisingly slow, given that it was mostly empty (-1 star), but they brought out 10 steak and eggs orders all at once so no one was waiting extra. This is the best steak and eggs deal in Vegas (for the price) because the steak is actually edible and not too tough to chew and the potatoes are seasoned well. Eggs are eggs. It's not gourmet, but when you're tired and hungry and in good company, tastes like heaven.\n\nAlso, beware the creepy guys on the casino floor who leer at girls in heels and short dresses.\n\ntl;dr: Best place for late night steak and eggs in Vegas!"

They have AMAZING NFL specials for food and drinks. A live DJ for Monday Night Football when we were there. There were prizes given away EVERY COMMERCIAL! It was fun to watch his winning shirts that said, \"I got good lip service\" Lmao! BBQ tools, wines and authentic footballs signed by Vikings and Niners players...\nGO NINERS! \n\nIt was definitely filled with Nine fans. My husband, unfortunately, was against my team. Whatever, jerk!\n\n$1 beers, deals on wings and sliders... you can't go wrong! \n\nExcept when the sliders have too much garlic. Oh well, it was only 1 batch we had with too much garlic.

I was out showing some new friends around Las Vegas and taking them to the more out of the way places tourist typically do not see. I thought Ellis Island would be the kicker for the night, because all four of the boys (Marines, btw) really wanted to do karaoke.\n\nWe arrived there a little after 11 PM and went to the karaoke bar and the place was pretty crowded. It looked like your Ellis Island crowd. I have been to Ellis Island before, just not to the karaoke part. Well we all got in no problem and grabbed some beers at the bar. Okay, they have incredibly cheap drinks. $1.75 for a beer. Crazy cheap. We all ordered a round of their in house light beer. Yes, they do brew their own beer, pretty cool. The boys went and selected their songs and my friend (who is a local) and I hung out to stalk a table.\n\nEventually a group left and we got a pretty sweet table in the back with a good view of the stage. Everything was going pretty cool - except for the fact the place was stifling hot! I don't know if they're trying to save money by not cranking up the AC, but when there are that many people in an old bar, you better get some AC running!! It did cool down, but being in a hot bar is just gross.\n\nAs we waited for the boys' names to be called we had another round and this time tried the Hefeweizen beer. Whoa. It tasted like orange juice, just straight up OJ with a splash of beer. I didn't really like it, neither did anyone else.\n\nFinally the boys names came up and they went to sing. The first one went and then we waited. And then the next boy got called. Well, they were planning on singing a duet song (Brooks & Dunn I think) and the lady running the karaoke wouldn't let them! She said they couldn't because the first guy had just gone up to sing. It was a shame. Plus right after that they let another girl go up who had just been up on the stage about 20 minutes earlier. Just seemed eff'd up to me and we were all kind of pissed about it.\n\nSo, we left on a sour note. We didn't feel like waiting around through another 10 singers just for the boys to get another chance to sing.\n\nIt was pretty obvious they were letting people who are regulars there go up on the stage multiple times, but first timers not so much. I get it, it's a local place and a local event and that's who they're catering to - but they made ME feel bad because my friends got skunked out of doing karaoke! \n\nThis night just left a bad taste in my mouth (with the bad Hefenweizen and the situation)."

We arrived on a friday night and there was a 30 minute wait to be seated at the cafe so we went to gamble for a bit. The table minimums are low so it was really nice for me who is a novice when it comes to gambling. It was so much fun and the dealers were very nice. \nWe were notified our table was ready so we left the games and sat down for dinner. Our waitress did not appear for about 15 minutes after we were seated. This was kind of a disappointment. We ordered the prime rib which is $15 buck and the best deal in town. You get a massive steak, some green beans, potatoes, soup/salad, and a beer. When they brought out the food, they did not give us knives. Who forgets the knives when serving steak????? We stared at our plates for about 10 minutes until someone came by and we asked for them. \nThe food was delicious, tender, and flavorful. We got the IPA's and they were not impressive at all but I didn't really pay for them so I wont hold it against them. Just don't come here to be super impressed by their brewery. \nLastly when the check came our waitress didn't give me a pen to sign the receipt. We had to ask another server to borrow her pen. \nThis place is great if you want a good meal at a great price. Their  casino is fun but their waitress could have done a lot better."

Though a bit off the strip, it was not too bad of a walk going through Bally's from Las Vegas Blvd side. We were promptly seated and ordered our steak and eggs for $5.99 - awesome.\n\nThis must be a different one than the Steak special from friends Dmitiy S. & Nina Y.'s reviews because it did not come with beer, salad, or mashed potatoes, but rather eggs, potatoes, and toast. Also, the steak was cooked more on the well side when ordered. Typically I get medium rare, but this time I ordered medium and it was more medium-well. Just a tad crispy for my liking, I still really enjoyed the steak for the value - a good 8 oz. The plate definitely filled me up, and I was actually glad we stayed out rather than heading back to the hotel to sleep.\n\nTip: juice not included, so when we got the bill, we were just a bit surprised that our small juices cost about half what the breakfast plate did...haha"

The steak and egg special (not on the menu, you have to ask) used to be $4.99,  then $5.99 then $6.99 now it's $7.99 and you have to sign up for the players card and then print out a coupon. Ok whatever, not a deal breaker, but the way we were treated a few nights ago did it for me.\n\nLike I said before, don't come here at night, and I should have taken my own advice. The place is more than half empty, but still we were told to take a number and wait. There were two parties of two ahead of us. They were seated within minutes. Then I noticed a couple that came after us were seated before we were. So I got up and asked the hostess. She said she called our number already, but we must not have heard her whisper it, bc we were sitting on the benches in the waiting area, right on front of her, and the place isn't big. I told her I was sitting right there. She says, were you sitting there, or there? Pointing to the two benches right next to another. Why would it make a difference anyway?\n\nSo we get seated and wait. And wait. And wait. Then the waiter comes by and takes our order. I say all my please and thank yous. And smile. There was a table of old retired cholos behind us. They were done and waiting to pay. They waited for ever to get their check, and forever to get their slips too. In the meantime, a party of old white people ordered and got their drinks, and later their food. We also notice another table of old white people who were sat after us, got their drinks already after they ordered after we did. At this point were still waiting for our drinks to come. Mind you the place is pretty empty and its the one waiter working this side of the restaurant. It's been about 20 mins since we ordered and not even our drinks! Wtf. At this point we got up and just left.  It was very clear to me who they wanted to serve there and who they didn't.\n\nI'm never coming back here again. Btw they don't do take out. If you ask they will just roll their eyes at you, say no and then walk away from you. But if you sit down and order way too much food, they will give you a to go box.  The Filipino waiter told me this. He was nice. Him and the petite Asian waitress. Everyone else there can kiss my flat Asian ass."

The craving has never been greater after one failed dining experience 2 nights before at the 'R' restaurant.  On our way to the Venetian, we stopped here for our late lunch.  \n\nThe casino is very small.  I think the restaurant took up 40% of the whole place.  However, people are very friendly.  It has that neighborhood restaurant feel to it.  The carpet is dingy, but since it's open 24/7, it'd be hard to try to clean it.  \n\nAnyway, I didn't have to think about what I wanted to order.  Both my fiance and I ordered the Steak Special for $6.99. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EAwh1OmG6t6p3nRaZOW_AA?select=nmhASW6s6tvE8en_VMKPmQ\nIt came with a soup or salad and beer or root beer.  \n\nI ordered my steak medium.  It was grilled to a perfect pink!  The steak was juicy and tender.  OMG!!!  This was the no B.S fine piece of cowboy goodness 10 oz of meat!  The baked potato was really good, but the green bean was too soggy for my liking.  \n\nYou might wonder if it was so good, why only 4 stars?  Well, I liked it so much I went back again just before leaving Vegas.  And this time, the steak was a little over-cooked on the outside and under cooked inside.  \n\nFor its inconsistency, I averaged it to 4 stars.

(2) The so called \"baseball size cut off the menu sirloin steak\" tough and tasteless - but then we am from cattle country and BBQ beef almost nightly - what would we know. Comes with enough tasteless nuked green beans that even the Green Giant would run away screaming No No No instead of Ho Ho Ho... (3) Drinks, watered down (coupons or not and frankly who cares). (4) Gaming: broke even and this was not why we were here anyway. (5) Cleanliness - lets not get me started on this one... (6) Street urchins were present around the back and front entrance - and had I wanted an injection of just about anything I imagine I could have got it for a buck or two. Not into drugs? - there were some pixies out there as well. This place is sorely over rated and feeds off it being the cheapest place close to the strip for those with little money left, cut 3 sheets to the wind or cheap.

They weren't bad, though. My steak was cooked perfectly, and my Pina Colada was only 3.00 and was also tasty. Nothing was disappointing for what we paid (or would have paid, anyway.) It's not like you can get better for this price anywhere in Vegas. \n\nSooo... all in all, I'll be back over and over again when I've had a stressful day at work and I just want a steak and beer that won't break my bank. =)"

We sat in the bar area and Cindy our server didn't bring us a menu, but because we are ubberly awesome yelpers, we had done our research and knew what we wanted to order. I had the steak, what was more awesome than the deal of $7.99... was that this steak plate came with a free beer. YES, steak plate came with a FREE BEER! I wasn't expecting to have alcohol with my mid-morning breakfast, but since it came with my meal, why not? This steak was thick (that's what she said), lacked a little in flavor, but it wasn't dry and it was $7.99 with a free beer! You have choice of fries or mash potatoes and soup or salad. The plate also came with green beans, awesome sauce because I've been lacking on my vegetable intake during this vacation. I forgot to mention, the $1 beers are for their own beer (since it's a brewery). I ordered the stout, which I really liked. I liked so much that I ordered another one after my free one. Great place to grab a bite to eat, I'm definitely coming back next time we're in Vegas. \n\nTip: the bar stops serving food from the restaurant area after 8pm."

            "review": "I'm torn with how many stars I should give this place.  The karaoke bar is a 0 out of 5, the rest of the casino and the restaurant are 5 out of 5. \n\nWe've been going to this place for years, namely for the $1 pints (I think they're $1.50 now, which is still super cheap).  They brew their own beer.  The Amber is my favorite...the light beer is not all that great.  Tons of gaming machines and a blackjack table.  Cocktail servers are usually pretty quick.  Also, they have a restaurant and a Metro Pizza in the casino.  Both are awesome.  The restaurant always has cheap specials, and the food is good considering the price range.  Metro Pizza always has slices ready to go, perfect after a ton of beer.  \n\nNow, on to the karaoke bar.  I've been to A LOT of karaoke shows in Vegas, and this is by far THE WORST.  Somehow it gets voted \"best of las vegas\" by the RJ every year.  They are the only place I know of that has karaoke every night of the week, and I think that's their big selling point.  The sound quality is absolutely ridiculous.  The KJ never touches anything to adjust volumes or mic settings (by the looks of it, they don't even have the equipment to do so).  This ends up in not being able to hear some people, while the really loud ones (especially drunk screaming girls) are just so overpowering that it's annoying.  They have probably the smallest karaoke song selection I've ever seen.  There's no instrumentals or bumper music in between the singers, so it goes from super loud shitty quality sound to dead silence while waiting for the next singer to get up.  I was there 3 hours and sang 2 songs.  By the way, tipping the KJ does nothing at all.  No matter the offer, she won't bump you up in rotation even a few spots, or stay past the end time whatsoever.  \"November Rain\" by GNR somehow got cut from 8 1/2 minutes to 4 1/2.  Then during \"Sad But True\" by Metallica, I replaced one of othe lyrics with the f-bomb, and you would have thought I was a terrorist or something.  Security came up to me and said \"sir, did you see that lyric on the screen? No, then you need to leave\".  So, good luck if you want to sing songs like Cee-Lo's F-you, Tenacious D's F-Her Gently, Lonely Island's I'm On a Boat, or any of the adult parodies like Summer Nights or With Legs Wide Open.  I would understand if it were a family environment, but you have to be 21 to even get in the karaoke bar.  And it's shut off from the rest of the casino in such a way that you can only hear the karaoke from inside the karaoke bar area. \n\nI'd much rather take my business to one of the PT's Pubs karaoke nights, where the hosts are upbeat and they actually enjoy being there.  Also, the sound equipment is professional with a full mixer board for the music & mics.  And the song selection is literally 10X what Ellis Island has.  Sahara/Decatur on Saturdays is one of my favorites.  In short, go to Ellis Island if you want cheap drinks , gambling, and good food, but STAY AWAY if you're looking for karaoke!!"

Beer is inexpensive and great! Service was excellent. We had the baby back ribs which were good - and at an affordable off-The-Strip price. Corn on the cob was over-boiled and mushy, cole slaw was OK, toasted bread was pretty tasteless, and beans were not the best. But again for the price, the meat was good. I'd go back for the brewery beer - $2.25 for a big glass. That was excellent. Not many choices on the menu, but that was OK. Atmosphere wasn't anything special but we were hungry and didn't care. We also got the player card and got $3 off apiece on our dinners, so that helped too."

All day, every day for $6.99 you get a nice, thick, juicy top sirloin cooked to your liking PLUS a baked potato, steak fries or mashed potatoes PLUS a nice portion of veggies PLUS soup or salad PLUS a tall glass of their home brewed root beer.  Seriously??  Yes!  \n\nFor the price, the steak was great!  Of course not like you'd get at a top end steak house or anything, but it was thick and tender.  No complaints there.  The fries were typical steak fries and the veggies were green beans.  No complaints about them either.  I got the soup, which was clam chowder that day.  Really good soup.  Nice chunks of clam and potatoes, perfect with some tabasco.  Finally, the root beer was great.  None of that Barq's crap here.  Home brewed with a good taste, more like a sarsparilla.   \n\nDefinitely my new favorite cheap eats place in Vegas!  Even state line/ Primm doesn't have cheap steak dinners like this anymore.  Trust me, we went to all 3 casinos there on the way to Vegas before finding out they don't offer it anymore.  Take the signs on the 15 down then!\n\nOh, yeah, and thanks D for buying us breakfast!"

As of six months ago I became a new mother and have not eaten there since (and while pregnant I ate there 2, sometimes 3 times a week). Apparently, since it is an over 21 establishment, there is no way for me to eat there. According to the manager I can only sit down and order then box what I can not finish. Well, how am I even suppose to do that if I can't even come in because I have a baby. Why is it this establishment can not make their food available to everyone? Before they had an actual restaurant everyone was able to order. They have officially lost a loyal customer."

Also had the best ROOT BEER in the world! It tasted like Dr. Pepper to me, but damn the best Root Beer/Dr Pepper ever.

My server dropped off a menu pronto, as if I had a reservation waiting for me.. Coffee was poured soon after and order taken as well..\n\nCinnamon Vanilla French Toast & Bacon: In my opinion, This was the Best French Toast I've had.. It was Pristine in every aspect of what I know a Traditional based French Toast should be. Now, I've had fancy shmancy French Toast with exotic fruits toppings, syrups, bread.. Some were decent some were great but my preference with French Toast is simple but done well. This particluar one was hands down, bow down, and praises to the chef/cook.. is on the top of my list. \n\nThe saltiness of the long and medium cooked bacon (they weren't the 90% fat strips or short well done crispy strips) just brought it home! \n\n* Busser here was so attentive, well mannered, very friendly and very fast. \n\nI got better service here than 5 star/diamond restaurants!!! French Toast is A 100% Must Try for those of you that appreciate an exceptional straightforward blue collar approach that would rival the Best of em'! Atmosphere felt fine and comfortable (like any other 24 hour cafe/diner). To top off the icing, the meal was inexpensive! \n\nThis little casino packs a Big French Toast Punch!!"

It's located just off The Strip, but pretty far enough to get away from the hustle and bustle of The Strip. \n\nThis is old-school Vegas at its finest. \n\nThe cafe is located on the corner of this casino with old, dark, rustic wood panels that reminds you of those classic movies from the 50's and 60's. It's definitely uniquely charming in it's own way. She ain't pretty, in fact she's pretty ugly...but beautiful nonetheless. \n\nVegas is known for many things, and Steak & Eggs is certainly one of them. Wifey and I were looking for a late-night place to grab some grub and this place lit up as bright as all of Vegas' neon signs combined. \n\nHow could you go wrong with a $5.99 Steak & Eggs special? You simply can't. This is unlike those $5.99 Steak & Eggs specials from Denny's, IHOP's and Reno. It doesn't even come close. \n\nSo the special runs from 11:00 PM to 07:00 AM. It's perfect for a town that doesn't sleep. They also make their own brew.\n\nThe one thing I was not expecting from a joint like this was exceptional service. The place is not a dump, it ain't first class either; and certainly not a place where one would expect great service. Our server, Rosie, was superb. Loved everything about her, especially her English accent. \n\nBesides their $5.99 Steak & Eggs special, she recommended the Prime Rib ($13.99) as they only had a few cuts left and we better get them before they are 86'd. Wifey and I decided to share, and Rosie said that it comes with a 20 oz. beer. \n\nSOLD!!!\n\nI ordered the 10 oz. Steak & Eggs ($9.99) while Wifey ordered the special, and the Prime Rib with a side of salad. Rosie threw in the soup of the day for good measure. This place did not disappoint one bit as the steaks were cooked to perfection with all the tenderness and juiciness one would expect from a medium rare steak. But I was in for another surprise as I cut a piece of the Prime Rib and the flavor just hit me like Manny Pacquiao's left hook. Rosie was right. \n\nHad we had more time in this town, we surely would have returned for an encore performance. But alas, that would have to wait until we're in Vegas again."

The BBQ experience also gets tainted by the fact there is no door separating the overwhelming cigarette odor from the casino.

That being said, this place is awesome if you want to get away from the strip but do not want to travel too far. The old establishment looks a bit run down considering strip standards but hidden inside is an oasis of craziness that one would expect from Vegas locals.\n\nThe Caf\u00e9 is a great place to catch a decent meal for a good price. I would definitely recommend their steak special which isn't advertised on the menu and is priced very cheap. I can't remember the price as it sits now, but it used to be 6.99 and I hear the price has risen due to the increased popularity of this \"secret\" order. Anywho, its cheap its edible and will fill you up. Don't expect it to be within \"Flemings\" steak house standards but it'll get the job done. It comes with soup or salad, a side of vegetables, your choice of carbs (mashed potatoes, baked potato, rice, fries, etc.), an in house brewed beer or root beer, and of course the freaking steak. Sit down, eat, and enjoy the sounds of people singing karaoke next door. Often times you'll hear some great voices, some not so great voices, and some people that sound like two dying cats.\nWhich moves on to favorite part number two of this place...\n\nThe Karaoke Bar!!! What can I say it's a public Karaoke spot on stage with DJ and a bar. What's not to love. Drinks are priced well enough in order to get your dose of liquid courage before you embarrass yourself on the front stage before everyone else. Don't worry there are a lot of people who are going to embarrass themselves so you won't be the only one. The crowd is amazing and friendly and everyone is there to have a great time. So go! Sing your heart out and hang out with the rowdy degenerate people of Las Vegas!!!"

Ellis Island casino and Brewery is small and dive-y in appearance and the location is not enticing. As you enter, you will notice the strong cigarette presence.  The restaurant is actually the 24/7 Cafe in the back corner.  The seating is done by a number system. My husband ordered the prime rib dinner which comes with soup or salad, choice of potato, green beans and a micro beer or root beer.  I ordered the grilled salmon.  Both meals were nicely done.   Our waitress seemed disinterested but efficient.  Another waiter brought out our meal, however, it was 2 meals of prime rib, which I suspect belonged to another table.  I explained to the waiter that one of the plates he brought out was what my husband ordered, so he left it on our table and returned the other to the kitchen. I had to wait an extra 5 minutes until my salmon entree came out.  But 4 minutes prior, the waiter brought another 2 plates of prime rib to the table behind us. \n\nBottom line, if looking for a restaurant with a large selection, decent taste and inexpensive, come to this place, but come early to avoid waiting too long."

There was no line but the cafe was packed of people. We seated on the waiting bench and had to wait for 10 mins before the receptionist showed up. She didn't even entertained us. I stood and she gave me a number.

We had to wait for another 20 minutes before our order came. We'll, the chicken fried steak looks big and looks delicious. My order was horrible.

I've been wanting to try this place since yelp friend Natalie Y. reviewed the prime rib here. \n\nI started  off with a tall beer for $2.00 and then ordered the prime rib which included rice or baked potato, veggies and a salad. My prime rib arrived fairly quickly and I was pleasantly surprised how tender and generous the portion was. The A jus sauce was yummy and the pilaf and green beans were solid too. I was sitting next to a local who has lived here for twenty five years and said this is one of his fave local spots to eat and I can understand why. \n\nService from my female bartender and server was friendly and polite. I would definetly return here again and the price is so reasonable."

The Light is piss in a glass, just horrible, as is the heffe, which is damn NASTY, this stuff smells and tastes like a fish tank smells, justt GROSS!!! But the Stout is not bad, and the Amber is actually pretty damn good. All beers at the main bar are $2.00 for a 20oz beer. They cost $.50 more in the lounge and cafe for some reason, so get em at the main bar. The IPA is the latest addition to the line up, and it is not very good, it in no way shape or form resembles an IPA, and in fact doesn't even come close to an APA. It needs a hop punch that just isn't there.\nThe star of this place is the food. The Cafe has good old fashioned comfort food at great prices. A full Prime Rib Dinner with a beer is under $13.00 and it is delicious!! A steak dinner with a Beer is under $8.00 and not too shabby either. There is a BBQ place that offers up standard BBQ fare at a great price as well, as well as a sandwich stand, and a Metro Pizza, both of which offer up tasty creations at reasonable prices.  \nSo go for the food, try the beers, you can't beat the price."

What a steal!\n-Prime Rib: Thick cut of juicy, fatty prime rib with jous. Comes with string beans, baked potato, simple salad, and beer(!). Quite possibly the best meal I've had for $12.99.\n-Steak & Eggs: Huge piece of sirloin with eggs and breakfast potatoes. Sirloin was not seasoned and actually too tough for my taste. But it was $10 so imperfections are forgivable.\n\nWait: I called around 7pm on a Friday and they told me the wait would be about an hour. When I asked when they'd slow down, they said 3pm-4pm or  midnight. ;) Needless to say, expect a long wait on weekend nights. \n\nAtmosphere: Feels like a family diner. Friendly quick service.\n\nCasino: Great way to kill time and lose money. $5 blackjack. Slot machines galore. Don't get suckered in like we did. They let you sit at the slot machines even if you're not playing. And there's a small bar where you can watch the game for free. ;) Oh and you can hear your number called from anywhere in the casino."

So far, I've had the chance to try their BBQ, which was really good and probably some of the best I've had here in Las Vegas. It was even better than this BBQ place I ate at in Houston. I've also had the prime rib twice now and although they are a little bit inconsistant with the temperatures, the meat is actually very tasty and is a great deal at just $12.99 which also includes beer. \n\nEllis Island has got to be one of the last places in Vegas where you can find some good food and beer at great prices.

            "review": "After dining at the buffets and fine restaurants during the past couple of days, we decided to give Ellis Island a try. We came here for breakfast on Sunday and had a delightful experience.\n\nThis is a great hidden gem in heart of the Las Vegas! The food is a throwback to what Las Vegas dining used to be 20 years ago - cheap, good food and great value. It's about a block walk from the Flamingo on Koval Lane. The caf\u00e9 is located inside the casino. Though not the fanciest, it's clean, cozy and staff is friendly. \n\nWhen we got there, a cocktail table was setup in front offering customers made to order bloodymarys for $7. Oh Hell Ya! It was simply too hard to pass up. We got a couple of them and they were delicious. It was the perfect situation while we waited for our table. A few sips in and our table was ready. The breakfast menu was presented to us which was pretty basic, but offered all the essentials breakfast items, including steaks, pork chops and chicken fried steaks. We ordered the steak/eggs ($7.99), corned beef/hash ($6.99) and French toast ($5.99). Our meal didn't take long to arrive and everything was on point. The steak was prepared perfectly medium, juicy and so delicious. Good thick cut portion, not the thin cheap kind either and more like fillet mignon size cuts. French toast was excellent, fluffy, thick and dusted with powdered sugar. Portions were more than enough to share.\n\nEllis Island might not be an oasis for foodies, but if you're on budget and want something satisfyingly good, than I highly recommend you check them out. Definitely looking forward to coming back, especially for their beers, $2.50 (20oz glass) which they have brewery on-site."

Told the wait would be 1 1/2 hours we got called in about 45 minutes.  Chicken and ribs were very good.  Wife did not like the beans which were watery (but I thought tasty).  We were given plastic fork, knife & spoon which made eating difficult.  (Try slicing meat with a plastic knife.)  Corn was pretty bad.\n\nWe ended up going back there for 2 breakfasts (mid-week BTW) and had no trouble getting in.  My wife was very happy with hers.   I had omelets both times and 1st was good and 2nd was passable.  Good toast (no small thing) and breakfast potatoes.\n\nWe did play slots there quite a bit.  My wife ended up breaking even (including losses at the big casinos) and I didn't lose too much with several hours of play.\n\nEllis is a 1 (Vegas) block walk from Bally's by a less than delightful fenced off, abandoned parking lot.  A couple of street people (junkies?) seem to sit out by the 7-11, but no trouble.  My wife was glad I was with her.\n\nNot really busy while we were there so smoke was not a problem, but it's one thing I hate about casinos.  I wonder why non-smokers have so few (or no) options?  Do smokers lose more???\n\nWe only went there during the day.  If I went at night I would want to drive."

The \"Best of\" polls in the local newspaper mentioned Ellis Island several times, so I figured I had better check it out. \n\nWalking in, I could tell immediately that this was not the sanitized-for-tourists Las Vegas I was already acquainted with. Ellis Island was old and smoky as all hell. I stepped up to the bar to order a beer, where a lone bartender appeared to be serving everyone in the entire casino at his own leisurely pace. I waited for several long minutes before being acknowledged by the bartender, who told me that walk-up service was on the other side of the bar. The allure wore off quickly, as after swinging around, I waited for literally another ten minutes before placing my order. The only beers on tap were the ones brewed in house, and I ended up with an Ellis Island \"Dark\" and an \"Amber,\" both of which were good buys for a dollar but otherwise unexceptional. Drinks in hand, I looked for a table at which to gamble, but there was no craps at the time and the only active blackjack table was full. I gave up. \n\nIn its defense, locals probably don't want to deal with the hassle and expense of the Strip. Ellis Island is accessible, and though I didn't eat here, the prices did look pretty great. However, the service was abysmal.  As a fan of good beer, I would have liked to sample the other brews to find a stand-out, but it would have taken far too long. Oh well."

I was told to sign up for their player's card and you can get a full rack of ribs for $15 with sides.  We got their late on a Wednesday night and ordered one of their large $2 draft beers and a full rack.  After maybe 5 minutes this HUGE plate came out with a full rack and a side of slaw, BBQ beans and bread.  The ribs fell off the bone and had very good flavor.  The slaw was average, but the beans were very good!  It was too much food, but I couldn't leave a bone with meat on it!  If you're in Vegas and was good BBQ at a great price, Ellis Island is a place to go.  Plus the machines are good also!!!"

If you can get past that, the food is really good and cheap.  We ate many breakfasts here and one dinner plus one BBQ in the front restaurant..  Breakfasts are the best.  Dinners are good too but as the day wears on, the patrons get more and more \"interesting\".  We were a little worried about our car in the parking lot.  We were approached by pan handlers on two different evenings.  I love Country Ham. And the ham was so huge that it covered the entire plate of eggs, hashbrowns and toast.  I made two ham sandwiches with the toast (for later)and still had tons of ham to eat with the eggs.  My husband had the steak & eggs and raved about them every morning.  \n    I want to say something about the BBQ up front.  The reason the wait is so long is because it depends on who you are.  We sat at the bar and waited for our number to be called while we watched locals come in and get seated right away.  I guess I do understand this (in a way, because they are loyal) but it doesn't seem quite fair.  My husband complained about it after waiting 1 1/2 hrs and they seated us immediately.  We weren't really impressed with the BBQ.  Maybe we were just irritated and nothing would have pleased.  We didn't go back and probably won't next trip.  BUT we will go back to the breakfast at the regular restaurant."

Which is all good,  because I can sit my but down and play $5 blackjack with Buddy (the dealer) and my other buddies.   (I actually made more money here in two visits than I've made at any other tables in Vegas, but that's a different review).    \n\nThe rib/chicken place is simplicity.  You got three choices, full rack, 1/2 chicken or 1/2 rack and 1/4 chicken.  BBQ sauce is sweet (like I like it) and the chicken and ribs fall off the bones.  For the $15 bucks (in Vegas, BABY), this is the best deal we had in our last two visits.  The corn on the cob was horendous, but, hey, it's about the MEAT, right?  Reviews which look to be all four or five stars.  \n\nCan't say anything about the regular restaurant; although I hear it is the place that cabbies go when at break/after shifts.  A good sign for decent cheap eats.  \n\nBads are only the corn (yuck, but out of season) and, like everywhere else in Vegas, the smokers abound.  Although not so much, it seems, this last visit.  \n\nIf you've lost all your money or looking for a cheap, simple, good meal -- go here one of your visits.  No glamor... straight up cards... Karaoke with the locals (interesting doesn't begin to describe it) and excellent BBQ."

A random person from let's say, OC area would probably not wanna step into this place from first glance. We wanted to try this place out because it was recommended by a coworker.\nIt has the old school vegas feel - old slot machines, cheap tables (3-5$ black jack), one main bar with cheap drinks, and they have their own brewery. Their beer is ranked like #9 in the states. A glass of beer here is like $1.75, and they are just awesome. I tried their hef & stout, I even asked for 2/3 hef, topped off with stout. After 2 glasses I was pretty buzzed!\nWe ate at their popular cheap restaurant. They have a large selection on their menu. With low expectations, my gf ordered their 6.99$ steak which comes with a salad and beer. She said the salad wasn't really fresh, and I tried her steak and for its price it was pretty good. It's like a steak you would cook at home without marinating at all, just the piece of meat thrown on a grill. I ordered their special, the pork pulled sandwich. The bbq sauce was pretty tasty and the pork was good. The bill came out to be like 16$, and our meals were very satisfying!\nConsidering the ridiculously low prices and all the good things that comes along with this place, they get a well deserved 5 stars! This run down gem of a place is definitely a new spot we shall stop by at least once whenever we are in the area."

I don't know - just depressing.\n\nThe walk from Bally's was long and hellish (yes, I'm talking to you, mentally unstable guy talking loudly to yourself), but we thought we'd walk a bit to build up an appetite.\n\nWe also saw some poor bastard drive his car over an abutment right in front of one of Las Vegas' finest.  He ripped up the undercarriage of his car AND got a Dewey.  Daily double!\n\nI was about ready to abort the visit when I smelled the ribs.  Oh.  My.  God.  Those ribs smelled awfully good.  Unfortunately it was too cold to dine outside, so we found a table inside (which was...depressing).\n\nThe ribs were pretty much outstanding, the beer was cheap, and our party of two got out of there for $32 (includes $8 tip).   Cheap.  The ribs had a lot of sauce on them, much of which I was wearing for the rest of the evening.\n\nIt's worth the trip if you like cheap and good food.

EGGSSS man\", we were pretty much zombies at this point. He directed us away from the strip and told us to hit up Ellis Island, \"you won't regret it\", he says.

The steaks were incredibly tasty and tender (in the back of my mind I always thought the steak would taste like coal), everything else tasted great (but how can you really mess up on eggs and toast).\n\nEllis Island is barely a MOTEL and casino, everything looks old and beat up (not to mention the staff and dealers). Don't expect fancy decor or the hootin' and hollerin' of young 20-something's, most of the customers and gamblers are middle aged or senior citizens.\n\nThe actual restaurant made me feel like I was in the 70's where mafiosos came to dine. There is usually a minimum 30 minute wait, but it's all good because they'll call your number while you walk around and gamble.\n\nI think their $3.99 steak and eggs are offered in the whee hours of the morning, so don't expect to find that deal during lunch hours.\n\nOverall a really unique experience, it gave me a feel of how Vegas used to be. haha"

I found this place on yelp and it had really high reviews so I had to come and try it for myself! We came here a little after 11pm, just in time when they start serving steak and eggs. We walked up to the restaurant and saw a lot of empty tables so we thought that it was a pretty slow night. However, when we went up to the host, she said rudely that the wait was about 30 minutes with another party of 6 ahead of us. We were all confused to why we have to wait so long because there was so many open tables. I thought maybe not enough servers? But still, 30 mins??\n\nSo we waited and our pager finally buzzed. I was so happy and excited! As I followed the same host to our table, I said \"the wait is actually not that bad!\" but she pretended that I didn't exist and ignored me -__-. So I ordered the $5.99 steak and eggs, medium well. We didn't wait too long until we got our food and the first bite of the steak was delicious! I was so excited to get to the center where its the most juiciest! However, they over cooked my steak to the point it was so dry and it was so hard to eat, like a well done x2 steak T_T. I couldn't even enjoy it nor finish it so I gave the rest to my boyfriend since he wanted it. The steak was so overcooked that the next morning my boyfriend woke up with his jaw sore from chewing the steak LOL!! I laughed so hard that morning hahaha. My friends ordered medium rare and it came out looking like medium. So yeah, my experience wasn't that great however the potatoes and the egg was good and our server was amazing! He was so nice and friendly to us unlike the host. I'm willing to give this place another try but make sure I order medium rare."

But you know what, for the price and the way it satisfied my hunger, Ellis Island's ribs blew me away.  Don't get me wrong, it's not the best slab of ribs I've ever had. In fact, it tastes like they actually BOIL the ribs, but once you slather on their tangy bbq sauce, your taste buds will beg for more as you tear into the tender ribs.  Too bad they don't throw the ribs on a grill and glaze some of the sauce on top of the ribs.  That would really take it up a notch.  This place would have received 4 stars if their beer was better, but can I really complain about a 2 dollar beer?  At least they made an attempt to brew it themselves.  Kudos to that.  If I'm craving for cheap ribs again in vegas, I'm comin' here."

Their customer base is also pretty diverse although there's an old people diner kind of feel to it. But enough about that, steak and eggs! Comes with potatoes and toast. Service is decent and they serve your party's order at the same time so it might take a while for your order to arrive. Also worth noting that we waited 45 minutes for a table. Seemed like their standard for a Sunday brunch since there were so many other people waiting. They could use more servers though, as the wait was definitely not due to lack of tables."

            "review": "We decided to hit this place up after reading the reviews.  When my husband and I arrived at Ellis Island Casino and Brewery, we were not aware that there are 2 different dining areas.  There is a BBQ restaurant by the door and a restaurant towards the back of the casino.  \n\nThe BBQ restaurant is to the immediate left of the front door.  There is an inside and an outside seating area.  If it is really cold and windy outside, do not expect to be able to change your seating to the inside immediately.  The host will re-list you at the end of the list for inside seating.  Many tables of people complained and asked to be reseated inside but it was not happening.\n\nThe BBQ menu has two separate prices- it is cheaper when you join your player's club.  Just put your name on the list and go sign up for the player's club.  After 24 hours, they even give you a $10 match play.  The BBQ menu consists of a small menu or chicken, beef or ribs and the estimated wait for us was 1 hour and 40 minutes.  Get there early, place your name on the list and wait.  It will be totally worth it!  We were hooked and had to come back the next day to patronize the restaurant.\n\nAt the restaurant, the $6.99 steak special is served with a side salad and your choice of fries/mashed potatoes/baked potato was also worth the 40 minute wait.  We found the karaoke room by the restaurant and parked our asses in the seats so there was no temptation to keep gambling until your number is called.  Remember to ask for your dressing on the side, the kitchen just ladled a ton onto our salad.  It almost looked like a stew when we got it. \n\nWhile you are waiting, get one of their special brews for only $1.50 at the bar!!!!  The dark beer was one of the best that I have ever had and I managed to have 4 before I was able to be seated for dinner.  I am definitely coming back here the next time I am in Vegas.  Both meals have beat out any buffet that I have had at the Bellagio."

You also get side salad, fresh warm bread & butter, potatoes, and a good amount of well-prepared & seasoned fresh green beans (a nice touch). \n\nThis place prides itself on quality food & good beer, and they deliver....which is more than many cheap places can say. Can't say I'll remember the steak in the future, but it wasn't at all bad.\n\nThe only negative is that the smoke smell is strong, although I guess it's like that at every 2nd/3rd tier casino and you can get used to it for a 1-2 hours....after that it's time to get out."

The chicken was pretty good.  I thought the breast was pretty dry but nothing BBQ sauce won't fix.  The rest of the chicken was ok.  I'm usually not a chicken guy but this was solid.\n\nBeer is super cheap at $2.  The beer is alright.  It tastes watered down.\n\n\nTIPS:\n-Sign up to be a member to get a discount on your meal.  It saves you about $3-$5 a plate.\n-The wait time can be long so queue up before you gamble."

Dim lighting inside with an overwhelming rush of smoke. We got there early so we decided to have dinner in the bar while we waited for the show. Turns out the food was fantastic! Probably the cheapest and best food we had the whole time in Vegas! I ordered a club sandwich and my boyfriend had fish & chips. The portions were huge and very reasonably priced and delicious. \n\nLuckily we got there early because this place packs up! Seems like it was the type of bar where alot of locals like to hang out, so we felt right at home. The service... sucked. We had to go up to the bar and wait a long time to order a drink but at least they weren't overpriced. The karaoke crowd is a very appreciative bunch and we had a blast!"

Yeah, Ellis Island Casino & Brewery doesn't have all the shiny bells and whistles like the larger casinos, but it also doesn't have a drop of pretentiousness. You could literally come straight from the pool with a cover on and nobody would blink. The smallish space is separated into 3 main areas: casino (mostly penny slots, $5 roulette table, one craps table...), the karaoke bar (yup, even I would have shamelessly belted out \"Work it Bitch!\" - everyone having such a great time and absolutely no judgment - only claps and hoots of encouragement for even the worst crooner's), and the diner (seems like most people visit EIC&B more for the food - and beer - than to gamble; I'll get to that more in a bit). \n\nCasino: No bawlers to be found. Plenty of fun ways to drop a few bucks and still leave with money in your pocket. The machines are actually quite friendly and roulette [worst odds of all games] turned out be \"odds ever in my favor.\" :D  \n\nThe Brewery: About 6 different beers brewed on site; can view tanks from the casino. Voted #1 brewing in Nevada by the National Brewer's Association, the micro-beers include Light, Amber, Weiss, Stout, IPA, a Seasonal Special, and even Root Beer. I personally didn't care for the Light; however, the Stout was legit and the husband enjoyed the IPA. And, if you're not interested in gambling, these large 20oz. draught pour will only set you back a mere $2.25 at the bar. Cheers! [free tours available by appointment]\n\nThe Karaoke Bar: Fairly large space, lots of seating including communal, loud as would be expected, filled with some of the happiest folks I've seen when visiting Sin City. One word: fun! \n\nThe Diner (there is also pizza and BBQ stations on-site): Approximately 30 minute wait for table for 2 at around 11pm on a Tuesday night. They will take you cell number and you can spend your time entertaining yourself until you receive the text. Very convenient. Waiter: His \"Furk You, I'm too slammed to even let you finish a sentence and I don't care you're here\" attitude almost made me get up and walk out (note: all other staff, including hostesses were all really friendly). But everyone raved about the food, and we were already seated, so...the hubster and I weren't even hungry, but we really felt we would be remiss not to sample a menu item. Vast menu runs the gamut from 24hr breakfast to King Cut Prime Rib. Tried to order PR - out. Okay, The NY Strip & Shrimp for $12.49!: included a salad, thick 8oz. steak, about a half dozen decent sized shrimp, and choice of potato (baked - out, okay...home fries). The Furk You waiter was actually nice enough to bring out two separate salad plates (without even have been asked) since we were sharing the entr\u00e9e. Massive serving of crisp iceberg, creamy dressing, and croutons. Simple salad. The steak had beautiful char marks on it and came out cooked spot on mid-rare. Surprisingly good flavor - quality easily superior to any chain steak house.  Perfectly breaded and fried shrimp were also a nice surprise. The home fries, frankly, sucked. Soggy, under-cooked, oh well. Overall, hell's yeah! Best bargain in Las Vegas! Future repeat offender here for sure!   \n\nSo glad a local buddy recommended this joint! The hubby and I are always looking for something new/different to do (in Vegas or elsewhere) and we both love a good dive. Jackpot!!! ~$5 cab ride (or you can walk if  you so dare) from the The Strip you will find the true OG Ellis Island Casino and Brewery - reminiscent of the Fremont area when they first started revamping until it turned into the new mini-Strip over the last couple of years (merp!). Highly recommend. \n\nNote: It is a little disconcerting that there were so many security guards walking the interior - easily 10. Seemed safe to me, but there was that one couple who were a little too eager to be friendly, compliment me on my wedding ring, and eyeball my handbag when my hubby stepped away from where I was seated at the bar. What's up Slim Shady? So I guess, just be cognizant. I suppose I wasn't inebriated enough...yet. ;) Hey, it's Vegas baby!"

And for those of you complaining about it being too far away its located just off Koval and Paradise, which means its only a stones throw Paris / Ballys / Planet Hollywood and is as close as you can get to the strip without being on the strip.  \n\nAnd hello did you read the first line of my review. $12.99 prime rib, baked potato and BEER...lots of it too and they're dirt cheap.  All beers are brewed on premise are only $1.75 for 20 ounces of ice cold goodness.  Now if that's not enough to sell you on this place come for happy hour when its only a buck!"

We both got up to use the rest room and when we got back our food was gone! Like really? The plate was still half full! The waitress was unfazed, asked if we wanted her to remake it which we said no just give us the check. She brought a box of french fries which was a nice gesture, but not what we wanted. Tossed our water, I mean beer, into to-go cups and high tailed it out of there. I'm sure the other food is very good, maybe our waitress was having an off night, but the beer is unexcusable."

Its located a block from the strip (vegas block not city block...its a walk) \n\nBrewery: This place is all about the price. $2 craft beer in a 20 oz pilsner glass. This place is a gem when a deal in vegas is $1.50 budweiser bottles. This is CRAFT BEER. Well...none of the beers blew me away, but I still support breweries every time. Their Stout and Hef is worth trying though. They also make a Lager, Golden, and Amber Ale. Nothing too aggressive, which I miss from Northern California Beers. \n\nCasino: Old school feel with a mix of new and old slot machines, $5 table games with really nice dealers. Lots of TV's for watching the game. Place where the locals and taxi drivers hangout. \n\nRestaurant: Cheap, cheap, cheap...prices range from $3.99 to $15ish. Good food for the price. Patty was our server for a group of 11 and she was so friendly. Way to take care of us in hangover mode."

Mosey on towards the cafe and a hearty meal can be had for a reasonably low price. $2 pints are easy on your pocketbook too; try to find that anywhere on Las Vegas Blvd.  The ambiance of cigarette machines and celebrity art work let you know there's no other place like this.\n\nSo if you're looking a change in scenery or just need a break from the strip, head over to Ellis Island and escape from the mainland!"

It's located off the strip but not unreasonably far from the Paris/Bally's area. We already heard about the great deals they had on meals but when we saw the sign for a $6.99 sirloin steak dinner with a BEER while driving into the parking lot, it was like a dream come true!\n\nWe eagerly waited for our number to be called while playing some slot machines and that only took around 35 minutes. The crowd in there was comprised mostly of senior citizens and families but we didn't mind! Our server, Jorge, was so wonderful and nice which earned him extra tip money!\n\nOk, so I thought that maybe my meal would just come with a dinky steak and a tiny glass of beer for that price but boy was I wrong! The meal also came with a choice of salad or soup, a side of garlic green beans, and either a baked potato, mashed potatoes, or fries. The sirloin steak was a massive 10 oz too!! That's unheard of! The beer also came in a tall pint size glass and I only drank 1/4th of it. haha Jorge was kind enough to switch my amber ale to the light lager at no cost since it was too bitter...thanks Jorge! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EAwh1OmG6t6p3nRaZOW_AA?select=VMGabUn6LbE-O-gPJoKmhQ)\n\nThe side salad was nothing special...just a bed of lettuce and shredded carrots plus croutons. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EAwh1OmG6t6p3nRaZOW_AA?select=kgpQGG1vNftJZdY9dnRNkg) My cut of meat was cooked perfectly to medium rare...it was so juicy and tender. The green beans were tasty with a hint of garlic flavor. The baked potato was great too with some butter and sour cream to top it off! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EAwh1OmG6t6p3nRaZOW_AA?select=-Asg4AY1pRLwMNMAKwbWlw) Needless to say, I devoured most of my food but not my beer unfortunately. Definitely worth the wait and drive/cab ride out here!"

I got fries, as I always do, but wish I had gotten the mashed potatoes as the taste I had from my boo's plate was incredible.\n\nMy meat was ordered medium and the color was just right--a bit of pink in the middle--but I was blown away by how tender it was. I ate at the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco about a year ago and the rib I had at Ellis Island was just as good, if not better. And for only $15!! It's a good thing I'm not a local, otherwise I would eat here everyday. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because everyone who works there seems to hate their life. Our waiter sucked (disinterested and didn't bring my drink until the end of the meal) and the guy working the players club desk definitely didn't want to be there. However, it was all so minor compared to the amazing meal I had!"

Ellis Island was very warm and smoky and the wait was 90 mins so we plopped down at bubble craps and started our empire. They had half regular BJ dealers and half impersonator/holiday dealers with each one taking a turn singing a karaoke version of a song from their respective artist's catalog. (They also have lively karaoke out by the Cafe)\n\nPit bosses very aware and caught one of our dealers giving a win to me (when I had a tip/dealer bet out  front) when in fact dealer had me beat by 1. Uncomfortable.\n\nCafe was nice but on Christmas day at 10:30 PM they ran out of prime rib! Manager overheard us ordering and came over to inform us. What the heck! (reason for minus one star .. plus waitress was kind of rude but it was end of her shift I think and she wanted to be rid of us.)\n\n\"This is the tragedy of our trip.\" -P, my partner. And yes, yes it was. Their WORLD FAMOUS EGGNOG, however, was amazing. I hate eggnog and loved this. Probably because it was spiked.\n\nFood was good anyway but gambling is where it's at at this tucked away spot not far from the strip. Did I mention FIVE DOLLAR blackjack ALL DAY LONG? Yes! $2 min on bubble craps. We definitely came out ahead and it was a nice short drive to the flamingo."

You can definitely catch a nice buzz with a slim wallet here.  \n\n\nThe dive bar vibe is great and all the patrons are laid-back.  It's a great place to sing karaoke for the first time because everyone gets into it, but not too into it.  If you forget the song, the MC will help you out.  The wait to sing can be kinda ridiculous sometimes, but we all know attaching something green to your request speeds up the waiting game.  And the MC will get to your song eventually.  Even though karaoke only goes til 3am officially, it usually always goes longer.\n\nA sour note from the other night: we sat down at a booth and since a cocktail server didn't come around, I went to the bar to get our drinks and he told me that I should go back and she'll be there soon.  Um, wtf?  Obviously, \"soon\" wasn't soon enough for me...so just fulfill my drink request without any side commentary...thanks!  \n\nAlso, I know it's a bar and people are smoking, but the ventilation system in here needs to be redone ASAP!!

The craps table there cracks me up, it's half sized and really little.\n\nBut if you're looking for the best combination of value and taste for steaks and prime rib, I highly recommend the restaurant here.  We found out about this place from some local Vegas friends and I must say it didn't disappoint.  The prime rib was cooked to perfection and the beer and root beer, brewed on site is really tasty."

I think it's funny when you are driving through the parking lot there is a sign that have the beer price and you can tell it's been changed many times.  I always joke with people that their beer prices are like the stock market.  \n\nFirst let me talk about the beer.  They are pretty standard, Amber, IPA, Stout.  and you also have a root beer.  The beer isn't special but its a craft like beer that is cheap.  When you spend $12 on the strip for a 12oz corona you learn to appreciate this place.  They have a little lounge in the corner that has karaoke.  Let me warn you though,  it does tend to get pretty smokey on the weekends.  Also, every time I have been in the lounge there has been a homeless guy sitting at the bar.  Or, he might have been a truck driver.  Either way Ellis Island is for everyone!  It's not some secret hipster bar that serves strange drinks.  \n\nI always heard about the food here.  We have only eaten here a couple times.  Is the food incredible?

This is saying alot since there are so many restaurant options to choose from on the Strip. Here, the prime rib is a must try. I order it rare and mooing. It came out tender and very flavorful. All their entree comes with a soup or salad. I opted for their salad with house Italian dressing. Their Italian dressing is one of the best I've tasted. I wanted to drink it like a shot with what I had left after finishing my salad but decided against it. The second time I came, I had the surf and turf, which was an 8 oz. sirloin with butterfly battered shrimp. Very tasty. \n\nNow the service is not the most friendly here and keep in mind there is a strict rule that they do not allow separation of the bill. We wanted to separate our bills but they said NO EXCEPTIONS! If you do want separate bills, I'd suggest to go as party of one and request to be seated next to your friends. This is a loop-hole that I thought might work. Maybe...maybe not. \n\nI only had their stout and it held it's own and was pretty good. \n\nIf you want great food at great prices, don't care too much about the service, this is a place to go for a great dinner without all the extra fluff from Vegas."

Heck, it was cheaper than most restaurants  anywhere for what you get. The prime rib was huge, came with a beer, baked potato, and grilled asparagus for $14! Steak and eggs on another night was $6, and the gravy with the chicken fried chicken/steak is infused with cheese, yum. The restaurant is unfortunately quite smoky (right next to the casino), but I didn't care with the food arriving quickly and being so well prepared.

Fatty meat, juices oozing out, tender loving care by the mouthful.

Originally we went for $6 steak dinner (not on the menu) and $1 draft beer. Since then, prices have raised- beers are now $2/pint at the bar, and $2.50 at the table. I in no way believe that's expensive, just pointing it out. Also- the steak special is now $12, unless you have a coupon, which you can only get if you have a player's card. With the coupon it's $9 or so. So keep that in mind when you come. \n\nHonestly the steak is pretty good but on our last trip, we ate here two times and I got different items instead. Once I got the chicken and rice pilaf, I can't remember the exact name. It was excellent- sauteed chicken breast, spinach, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms on top of pilaf. It also came with salad. The next time I got \"no carb fried chicken\" which is just fried chicken without breading, and I will say that this made me rethink fried chicken completely. It was without a doubt much better than most fried chicken I've ever had, specifically because the skin was able to get very crispy not being battered, and the meat was incredibly moist and flavorful due to the skin being on. \n\nWe've definitely had some colorful visits here, and sometimes the food has been not as good. The steak can be chewy and tough at times, and once my father literally choked on it (like, there was a line of people giving him the Heimlich maneuver). However I think he blames it on his lack of chewing, not the food, since he happily returns here for the steak. I realize that's a bizarre endorsement but hey, it's gotta count for something. Our most recent visit, it was right after my birthday and right before my mother's birthday and our waiter brought us a free slice of their chocolate cake. Normally I wouldn't care much about free chocolate cake, but this was fantastic. It was also made in house and really made me see their desserts in a different light. The BBQ, pizza and deli options here are also very good, so I would happily come back here on my next trip, and if you want a good cheap meal, I would recommend others come here as well."

Not the best food or wine around (was actually on the watery side) but what else do you expect with those kind of prices?\n\nDo I think its something to enjoy in Vegas?  Sure, why not?! It's Vegas -- but def look around for other deals too :)"

The casino and hotel itself is not impressive... it's technically a Super 8 motel with a casino across the way. The hotel rooms are located across from the casino. The casino is small, but inside there is a BBQ place, cafe, and pizza place. \n\nI like coming here for the BBQ. It's super cheap... and good!! I have yet to try the cafe, but I've heard lots of good things about it also. For the BBQ, I always get a full rack of ribs and it's only $13! It comes with 2 pieces of corn, 2 pieces of garlic bread, slaw, and baked beans. The ribs are tender and tasty. They also have a half rack of ribs for $10, but a full rack is more worth the cost! They also have 1/2 ribs and 1/2 chicken or you could also get a whole chicken. I've never tried the chicken but I love ribs so much that I've only ordered the ribs! You must sign up for the players card for the lower price however because it's $3 more without a players card. Also, if you gamble $1, you will get that dollar back as a $1 coupon of any item for either the cafe or BBQ place. Who knows, that may be the lucky dollar that you win lots of money from! Trust me, because I've put in $1 before, played 75 cents and came out with $250 with a single spin!\n \nThe promotion for new players now is to play $10 and you will get free play in the amount of $10-$500. It's worth it because technically you aren't gambling any money but you could win money! \n\nThere is a parking structure at this casino. It's a small structure, but I've never had trouble finding parking. I've also never had a long wait for the BBQ. Maybe I've always beat the rush! On Sundays the pizza place is 2 for 1. \n\nCome here for the food. It wound disappoint! I would also like to say that for such cheap food, I've never had bad service here! All the workers and servers have been friendly and the food comes out fast too!! Mmmm.... I'm getting hungry just thinking about the ribs again!! You can bet I'll be here again!"

I'm warning you - this isn't a place you want to eat. After all, it is connected to a Super 8.\n\nWhile the atmosphere is very \"Southern Americana\" you would never know based on the food. For $8.99 or $12.99 without a free players card, you can get a 10 ounce steak, green beans, baked potato, soup or salad and a 23 ounce microbrew or root beer.\n\nEven though I am a beer snob I have gotten root beer both times and have loved it. By the way, the place has great service and even has five dollar blackjack tables right outside. Moreover, it is next to a 7-Eleven which is great for picking up booze on the way back to the hotel."

Includes salad or soup, potato, bread, green beans and a beer \n\nOur server was MIA most of the time. Took well over 40 minutes for our dinner to come out. Some of the tables that were seated well after us were either eating, or getting their checks before we saw our dinner. \n\nSteak - Both of us ordered Medium Rare. J's was almost blue. Seared but still very pink in the center. But it was warm to the touch, so he decided to not send it back. Now this I cant understand. You almost under-cook a steak, but its still tough!? How do you accomplish that feat?! My steak on the other hand was more on the well done side than medium rare. Terrible. I took maybe 2 bites. I'm sure boot leather would have tasted better. J ate maybe 1/4 of his steak. He's a huge steak fan, so that's gotta show you that something is wrong. \n\nSalad (mine) - You can't really screw up a salad. \nSoup (J's) - He said it was \"alright\". \n\nBaked Potato - This was the best part of the whole meal. \n\nGreen Beans - This was a tie for the best part of the meal. Lots of garlic, which J and I love. \n\nBread - Love sourdough, but this was almost inedible. \n\nBeer - J ordered an Amber. Since I do not drink, I asked if I could have a diet soda. No Dice. So I ordered a beer and gave it to J. And just stuck with water. \n\nHe said just for the beer's alone, it was almost worth $7.99 a piece. If we could have had a Mr. Lucky's steak with Ellis Island's Baked Potato and Green Beans, we would have been happy campers. \n\nWill we return to Ellis Island for eats? Maybe, but probably not to the restaurant. We might try the BBQ or Pizza joint next time. \n\nNow for the casino review - \n\nVery friendly and helpful dealers. I mentioned to J that if he wanted to learn to play craps, now was his chance. When there were other players, there were maybe 1-2 tops. The craps dealers were all very helpful on teaching him the ropes. With $80, J played easily for 2 hours. Left being down only $30. Not too shabby!!"

Ellis island was a cab-ride away from our hotel which was on the middle of the strip, I think about $7 there with tip and then we walked back to the strip after our meal (maybe a 5-10 minute walk). \n\nWe had to check in to get a number; the wait was about 35 minutes and we finally sat down around noon.  The casino itself was overly-smoky just like all old casinos in Vegas, and I was starting to get sick by the time they seated us.  Also, waiting in a casino- not always the best idea; I lost about $10 on the slots during the wait so in reality, I spent more than what I would have if we had a simple breakfast on the strip...\n\nThe food- great value for the price!  I ordered my steak medium and it was pretty decent if not a little tough.  I ordered fries instead of the breakfast potatoes for a little bit extra cost and eggs were scrambled.  I don't actually eat eggs, but I nibbled on them just to test- not bad. The size of the meal was decent- I left pretty full.   \n\nOverall, I thought the food was decent and a great value but in the future, I might have to stick to the strip.  I'm not a fan overly-smoky casinos and the fact that there was no other casinos or attractions next door; I was smoked-out by the time we had finished breakfast."

The first group, sat, got served and had a pleasant meal. The next group sat down before I did (BEFORE 2PM) and after an hour wait for all of us.\n\nfinally about 15 minutes later, just before 2, my group got seated and immediately ordered the steak and eggs. Our server Joann was amazingly helpful and got our order in. After about 20 or so minutes, our food gets here, so I decide to get up and check in on the rest of my party. Now mind you, this is already 45 minutes into the meal. The first group still hasn't gotten their food, but their waitress said it was just about to come out, so I didn't make a super big deal of it. When I got to my second group, I noticed very very angry faces. THEY STILL HAD NOT GOTTEN THEIR FOOD. AND THE WAITRESS WAS IGNORING THEM. I was appalled so much I almost didn't  believe it. That is, until I saw it happen. I decided to sit down with them for a little, lo and behold I watched as their server walked right by them, even when my friend had her hand up and was verbally asking for assistance. WHAT THE HELL!. I end up going back to my table more visibly upset and scarf down my food in anger. another 15 minutes goes by and I walk back to see my friend Steve talking to the manager. I join in on the conversation and hear that their food STILL hasn't come out yet. \n\nAfter I join in on the talk about dissatisfied service, the manager walks into the kitchen and a minute later the food comes out. Really! All it took was getting the manager involved? SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY.\n\nOh! It's not over yet!

They also got the ham steak and eggs, and uhh... well needless to say he needed a glass of water with every bite as it was DRY DRY DRY DRY!!!!\n\noh and after almost 1 hour 30 minutes of hold up and terrible service, the manager only comped one of the meals....\n\n\nWTF ELLIS ISLAND.

It's a limited availability special drink that is a boozy, noggy delight! After missing it for a few years, I returned a few days before Xmas to get me some. \n\nAnd on the negative side- My first stop was at the Player's Club to redeem some coupons. There were no employees working there because they were ALL at a staff meeting. OK..........so I went to the cashier where they can get you a card, but still needed my T-shirt & promo play from my coupons. I then went to the bar near the BBQ restaurant for my Nog. This is where it gets bizarre. I ordered a glass of the nog from the (supposed) bartender, who could see that I was going to play. He gave me the nog, then another bartender walked out & I guess told him they can't comp the nog. She said to me, you're good. Well, that's great, since I'd already taken a sip & wasn't giving it up! I recall this same scenario going down years ago at the same bar!!!  They used to comp the nog if playing, I believe. \nI won this round with no loss on video poker & the free nog. \n\nI was able to redeem my coupons shortly thereafter at the player's club. There was a lot of chatter there about why they all went to the meeting & left the club unmanned. I played my $10 promo play & won that round too- up $20 and a free winter spiced ale (Very tasty!) from the free kiosk game. \n\nAside from the must try egg nog, the beer prices (about $2 for a large glass) are probably worth a visit. The cafe also has a steak special for under $10- price can vary if you have a player's card or not, and it comes with a draft beer or root beer. I've had this meal a few times & it's a great deal. The casino was recently remodeled, and I noticed right away. It's brighter & less smoky! They installed a ton of ceiling fans, and the new floor is pretty nice too. \nHere's a great tip- All Village Pubs also serve the holiday nog. So avoid the shiftyness I endured and just go there instead. \n\nOn their Web site, I spotted this- Free Brewery tours- Email Christina at cellis@ellisislandcasino.com. Let me know how that goes."

You can opt for mash potato's, baked potato, fries, and it comes with green beans. I always get the mash and the reason why is because it's a cheesy mash potato with gravy and it's smooth and buttery. The prime rib in itself I always get medium rare and you get a slab. I wouldn't compare it to Lawry's type of prime rib where the whole meat is juicy. This while tasteful you can tell the quality isn't the same.

Add a soft drink or coffee and you still come out under $10.  Sure, the Wynn it ain't, but that is nonetheless a hard bargain to beat when your tummy needs food.\n\nEven the drinks are cheap (as nearly every Yelp review mentions).  $4.50 for top shelf cocktails!  Unfortunately, as the years have passed, the drinks get more and more watered down, and I have reached my breaking point.

The prime rib was flavorful and not overly salty, the green beans were hecka tasty (might be some of the best I've had in a long while), and the steak fries were a little too pale for my taste.  The steak and shrimp (~$12) was edible, but definitely not the highlight of my meal.  Standard stuff I get when I go to Denny's or similar establishments.  BTW, the steak special everyone on Yelp raves about was not on the menu - well, at least I didn't see it.\n\nOther important info: The steak and prime rib can be found in the CAFE side and not the BBQ side, the service was too painfully slow (50 mins to get my food), tables are really close together, and apparently they have special root beer which is not listed under their soda section and costs more than soda."

It's relatively small, and I believe this is because they don't aim to be a casino that wants to attract a lot of attention from the bigger hotels of the strip. The location is mainly because of how the area is a *tad* bit sketchy, but when you're in a group you're perfectly fine.\n\nThe best thing about Ellis is the cheap drinks, period. Also, the best thing is the tables. I've really enjoyed playing blackjack here on the tables, I've seemed to have gotten decent luck at them compared to the hotels on the strip and the local hotels. I've tried their brewed beers on site, and while I'm not *too* much of a fan, they're cheap enough to give it a go. I do overall like this place, and hopefully my review might be of a better one in the future when I return!"

My boyfriend ended up ordering the pork chop dinner ($10ish) (includes 2 large bone-in thick cut pork chops, choice of potato (the mashed potatoes were killer!!) and a veggie (he got the corn) the pork chops were juicy, not dry and had a good seasoning and nice char flavor to them. hes a big eater and he couldn't even get thru half of his meal. I got their chicken Parmesan dinner, seriously this thing is ridiculous! its is a large Frisbee sized chicken breast flattened tho still managed to retain a 3/4 of an inch thickness! that's been lightly coated in a flavorful Italian breading topped with a tasty marinara sauce and lots of mozzarella cheese :) served with marinara covered linguine. then if that wasn't enough food this dinner also comes with two large slices or sourdough buttery garlic bread and a large side salad! (their house ranch was really tasty) all for 10.99!!! overall we had a really friendly and efficient server and the food was very good, we both ended up taking most of the food back to the hotel and having it for lunch when we woke up the next day and it was all still really good. \n\nAs for the casino, the casinos small and older. definitely seemed like a local spot and much slower pace. (it reminded me a lot of the casinos in mesquite) they only have a one craps table but my boyfriend was able to win back the money he'd lost while gambling on the strip, and the slots were that night were paying out pretty well. the casinos a very short walk if your staying at the flamingo/ballys/cesars area like we were and was nice to get off the strip and win some money and have a cheap meal! def coming back each time we come to Vegas in the future."

The main issue I have here is that they do not know how to cook their steaks consistently. My friend ordered his steak rare and got it medium rare. I ordered mine medium rare and got it done medium well. My other friend ordered hers well done and got medium rare. No, our plates were not mixed up, the little fork thingies on the steaks indicated how they were cooked. None of them were correct. \n\nAnyway, the eggs were great and the potatoes were excellent! Well cooked and reasonably spiced. I think the potatoes are the hidden gem in this deal (it should be called steak, eggs and potatoes!)

We recommend EI to friends, family, and colleagues. We supported EI when they had food safety issues, when they increased the price of their unadvertised low quality steak dinner special to an advertised $7 steak dinner - it really isn't a special- just off the menu increased from $5 (that's a 40% increase). We ignored their pathetic poor service, even the grungy Super 8 where undesirables stay.  But like all good things...they must come to an end. We can no longer support EI. \n\nThe final straw came when they started increasing the price of their steak dinner incrementally AND quickly.  Portion size started dropping too.  Perhaps we should be using a magnifying glass to look at our plates?\n\nWhat people may not know is that EI was in fact the number one top 10 listed and printed bargain in Vegas. That's no more. Their ranking had dropped. EI  now force you to spend $5 where you print out two coupons from an EI kiosk, the second after playing at least $5 in any slot machine with your club card inserted, to get the $8 price of their tiny steak dinner. That brings your steak dinner to $13, double what it was a a few years ago.   \n\nIf you're going to make it difficult for people to order your signature dish, you should give them some other incentive such as increase the portion size, not downsize them.  One food server told us discreetly and cynically that eventually management will serve you only a tablespoon or so of salad and tiny genetically modified potatoes alongside the ever shrinking steak where they claim it's 10 oz.  We don't believe that for a second that the steak is 10 oz, it's really small now.\n\nAny way, I get that many people are giving EI rave reviews, they do not know it's history...and that history wasn't that long ago. Many have no concept of what value is. I have not seen a $2 beer on tap in a long time at EI.  Even many of the locals have stopped coming here. As another fyi. The $10 streak and eggs is quite pricey here, you can go elsewhere like a place called ArizonaC that serves it a lot cheaper. You can have a breakfast buffet for less than $10at the Orleans. \n\nOn the plus side, not even the low grade prime rib (which is quite expensive even according to the new vegas standards) is worth having. Book an appointment for their bbq ribs and beans dinner/platter. That's the only good thing now at EI.\n\nIn summary, from our perspective, we seen EI as the must goto must  place in Vegas.  Now it's some dive where we would be afraid of eating food. We think it's days might be numbered. Perhaps it will be sold or more likely demolished. Sadly, it no longer lives up to the traditional Las Vegas tradition where you get genuine value for your dollar when it comes to eats."

My husband and I went to LV for the first time this weekend, and Ellis Island was highly recommended for their $6.99 steak dinner. Umm... NO. Let me tell you why we'll NEVER go there again!\n\n* We waited 35 minutes for what was supposed to be a 15-20 min wait.\n* Our 35 minute wait was right next to an open table, to which they took us to. HUH? Are you serious that we've been sitting by this open table for 35 minutes and you're just now sitting us in it?\n* Our waitress took FOREVER and was not that helpful.\n* The salad was your basic crap-bagged salad from the local grocery store, with one tomato. Yuck.\n* When we received our steak dinner, it was char-burnt, tough, with NO SEASONING. The baked potato was chewy and they had a little elementary cafeteria-style pouch of sour cream next to it. It looked a little.. uhh... GOVERNMENT FOOD PROGRAM-ish??\n* We didn't even finish our meal. Our waitress never checked on us, and we were ready to go. We waited and looked around as she never showed up again. I was almost about to take my food up to the register and ask them for my check. She finally shows up, we ask for our check and we leave.\n\nOh! The best part? They say, \"join the players club and you get $5 in free slot play!\" So we say, okay that meal was a dud, but let's at least try to win some money if anything. - well guess what? We go sign up, they give us our players card, and tell us it will activate in 24-48 hours!!! HUH!!! Are you serious! \n\nOur experience there was unbelievable. In the WORST way. I can't believe we walked all that way for nothing. Oh well, it's better that we found out, right?\n\nMaybe it was a \"cultural\" thing.

I've eaten here four times and it never fails to disappoint, it is a tender BBQ plate with BBQ Corn and all the other sides as well are great.  come here on off hours if you don't have time for waiting, because if you come here during mainstream mealtime you will have at least a 45 minute to hour and a half wait.\n\nFood Channel did a review on this place as well, and rated it very high, while I found out about the place from a cabbie I did find the review via google.\n\nThis is a can't miss when you are in Vegas, but don't be suprised by the actual casino itself, this is very much an off strip casino (behind Bally's)  Casino it is dark, smokey and not appealing otherwise the food."

I love love love me some prime rib and this place does not disappoint.  The portion is very decent, it comes with a side of garlic green beans and your choice of baked potato, fries, and I think a few other things.  You get your choice of soup or salad. And the best thing for me is their house brewed root beer.(I'm not a fan of beer)  My Bf always goes for the beer since you have your choice.  Oh, and if you want to order another beer or root beer, it's only $2.25!\n\nThe service is hit or miss.  The first time we came here, it wasn't too good.  But the second time around, we had the same waiter and it was really good.  Now the only bad thing is the wait, sometimes it's long, sometimes it's not.  I believe it depends on what time you come and how many people are in your party.  We came the second time around 9pm and were told that it would be a 35min wait.  Less then 10 min later, we were seated.\n\nThey have a huge variety of food, so if you're not a prime rib person like I am, they have filet, fried chicken, breakfast, fish, appitizers.  Basically American food.  Everything is reasonably priced and you can't go wrong coming here."

I ordered a chorizo burrito.  I wouldn't recommend ordering it, not because it wasn't great, but because it probably doesn't get ordered a lot and it took ages for our food to come out.

I give it five stars for its \"dive\" and dingy appeal, unpretentiousness, great beer, even greater root beer, and reasonably priced comfort food. \n\nI'm a casino employee (not at E.I.) and embrace the kindheartedness of E.I.'s daily graveyard special...casino employees drink FREE from 3am-8am!!!! As if the prices of their cocktails, homemade beers, domestic/import beers weren't cheap enough (and they are)...they go ahead and give a hand out to the honest casino employees. \n\nDrinks are good here with an emphasis on their homemade beers. If you prefer a non-alcoholic beverage, I can reassure you many Yelpers and I will attest to their homemade root beer. It has a very nice smooth carbonation to it, with a slightly sweet and bitter taste, and classic root beer scent. \n\nFood at E.I.... Upon sitting down, you will be served one dinner roll per person. However, beware of ordering too much! The appetizers, salads, and entrees are huge! We ordered: \n1) Two E.I. root beers \n2) Buffalo chicken wings w/mild sauce on the side (the sauce was so tasty but the wings were a bit on the small side) \n3) Chicken Parmesan sandwich -- BF ordered this \n4) Chef salad -- me \nMy salad was huge, like Cheesecake Factory salad-huge. All of the ingredients were fresh and, unlike most restaurants, they do not skimp on the julienne cuts of deli meats and cheeses. I got the 1000 Island dressing which was totally delicious. I guess it's because they make all of their dressings from scratch there. My BF's meal came with a small (normal sized) dinner salad w/a delicious French dressing. He commented that his sandwich wasn't great nor bad....just ehh. It looked like it was nestled on a ciabatta roll with a nice portion of chicken, cheese, and sauce. An older gentleman sitting near us ordered the special that night, roast pork dinner for $6.99. Oh my god, I don't think three people could've finished that plate. The food was literally piled 4-5\" high! If he had a small child behind that plate, I wouldn't have known it from my point-of-view. \n\nOur first dining experience at E.I. was very cool and laid back. The service was good and friendly. Luckily, we arrived at about 4pm, so we were seated with no wait. As we progressed through our meal, a small crowd of people began to form. As I saw it, their staff accommodated and sat each group quite quickly. Their restaurant system seems to be a well oiled machine. \n\nI hesitate to recommend EVERYONE to dine here because the atmosphere is not for everyone. Because of the portions of good food, cheap drinks, and gambling the tiny casino/restaurants (yes there are two \"sit down\" restaurants here) tend to attract some less desirable folk. The decor of the establishment reminds one of the 70s and the air does contain smoke. You will hear hoots and hollars, slot machine rings, and depending on the time of day you may visit, karaoke. So remember these factors before you decide to dine here. This is NOT an establishment that is trying to lure you in for its luxuriousness, theme, or glamour. It's a great and reasonably priced place to get away from all of those above!"

I was really skeptical since she said the prime rib here was under $10 with the Players Card and tasted exactly like the expensive stuff.  Still, I managed to pull my hungover self as a place to eat on the way back home on a Sunday and OMG I fell in love.  I ended up staying here a few hours longer than I expected and make it a point to come back here every time I'm in Vegas!  The first two times I came there was about a 20 minute wait, but the last time I came for lunch there was no wait at all.  I heard there is usually a wait so just make a Players Card and use the $10 credit they give you while you wait.\n\nThey don't have the prime rib as a special anymore but they have a top sirloin with a beer (regular brew or rootbeer) for $8.99 so I always order that instead.  The value for the type of food is spectacular!!!  The 8 oz steak I usually get medium-rare and usually is cooked to perfection except for one time (it was overcooked just a little but it was easily sent back).  It comes with a side of potatoes, green beans, and a salad.  The steak has a nice crust  and it so deliciously juicy.  All the sides taste like how they are supposed to and you'd be surprised by how not overcooked/soggy the canned beans taste cause they still have a slight crisp to them, and baked potatoes are pretty hard to mess up.  This last time I ordered a french onion soup and I thought it had a pretty decent flavor for being $4.99.  I have also tried their rootbeer and it tastes pretty good but you can definitely taste the spices at the end.\n\nI always end up sitting around the bar for a while before/after eating and just relaxing getting out of the hustle and bustle of Vegas.  I like winding down here and having a light beer (really refreshing!).  Bf always forgets and orders the Hef which he doesn't like and the 2nd beer always turns out to be a light heh.  Service is always quick and hospitable.   \n\nThere are tons of advertisements for cheap food with the actual food not looking like the advertisements, but hands down I think Ellis Island has the best taste and value for the price!  If you're coming to Vegas without intentions to spend a lot of money on food, definitely stop by here."

We originally didn't know which part of the casino to go to, so we originally happened on the BBQ.  The hostess there pointed us over to the cafe, where they serve the prime rib.  Before seated, the hostess asked us if we wanted dining room or lounge, and we of course, chose lounge (dining room looked full).  We went around 6pm on a Thursday night, and the lounge was empty, except for the bar, but was full of folks by 6:30pm/7pm.  Overall, very glad we went."

It is a hidden gem for locals, I would say tourists but we like to keep them out of the place. =) \n\nThe karaoke lounge is the best people watching spot around. Get yourself enough hard lemonades (at $1.75, who can beat it?!) and you might even butcher a classic Bon Jovi hit. Don't worry most people aren't laughing at you, they are laughing with you and probably singing along! \n\nI just recently tried their cafe and their 24/7 steak special is my new favorite thing. For $7.99 you get a decent steak, potato, veggies, bread, AND an EI beer or hard lemonade. Definitely worth trying out if you're on a budget like I am. \n\nThe center bar is always a great place to be entertained but beware of the sleezy dudes who might try to pick up on you.

A combination of old and new machines\n4. Lower limit blackjack tables with friendly dealers\n5. Easy on-site free parking garage\n\nI spent a lot of time here during my wedding weekend.  We had a number of people in our group staying next door at the Super 8 and it was always easier to gamble and eat here than going over to the Strip about a mile away.  \n\nOn our first night we realized how amazing the food was.  (Thanks Yelp!)   We ended up having the BBQ plate....10 bucks for a rack of ribs and a half chicken.  Wow was it good!   I had everything to eat here from pizza to their $7 filet mignon.  Sometimes the service was a little slow but they were totally busy and seemed understaffed and the wait staff was usually in an upbeat mood.  They did the best they could.  \n\nDo not forget that $7 filet mignon...you can't at least get that once while in Vegas. For that price you also get a free root beer or regular beer.  Their homemade root beer is damn amazing.  You almost get drunk off the root beer flavor, its that good.\n\nThey really do have a great selection of machines here...everything from the old-school physical reel one-armed bandit style to brand new ones like Sex-In-The City and Monopoly machines.  (Watch that Sex-In-The City machine...its max bet is 6 bucks a pull!)\n\nI played a good amount of blackjack here too...most tables were 5 bucks and the dealers were nice and pretty darn funny as well.  (No matter if you are winning or losing)\n\nOn my return trips to Vegas I will be spending a good amount of time here.\n\n:0)"

I was first introduced 2 years ago.\n\nFirst of all, I am a vegetarian so I haven't had their steak and eggs, but my friend swears on the Bible on it. Says it's the best thing ever.\n\nWe went there for the traditional post clubbing meal. Imagine 6 drunk girls stumbling into a shabby looking casino/restaurant at 4am talking obnoxiously loudly recapping the night. That was us. To anyone not intoxicated, we were probably annoying as shit.\n\nI got the baked penne which was good, but in my drunken stupor, my stomach wouldn't let me enjoy it to the max (and I ended up throwing it up. TMI, I know) and the rest of the girls got the usual steak and eggs. Although they said it was a little over cooked, they did all agree that the clam chowder was frickin' amazing. Things like \"Best clam chowder EVAR!\", \"OMG, it's not even this good in SF\", and \"I want another bowl NOW\" were said during the meal.\n\nBesides their food, what REALLY won me over was the waitress this last visit. Sure, it was probably our bad because we were annoying, typical girly Vegas visitors, and we were talking pretty openly about subject matters that should really not to spoken in public at high volumes, but when the table next to us complained to the waitress about telling us to shut up, she stood up for us. She said it's a public, open restaurant and it's freakin' 4am. Drunken, inappropriate talk should be expected and she really has no grounds to tell us to shut the eff up. Again, probably our bad, but I really appreciated the gesture =)"

Forget price gouging chains posing as fine dining. Here, a steak dinner with a baked potato runs you $10 and comes with a beer or root beer (!!!). I opted for the steak and eggs for dinner at the same price, because Vegas/America. Sure, the steak is not the finest cut, but for $10 what do you expect? Protip: If the dining room has a long wait, ask about being seated in the \"lounge\", especially for smaller groups. It's basically just the bar section and even though there was a 45 minute wait, I was able to sit down instantly in the bar, which was mostly empty.

Once we arrived, sure thing the place smelled of old cigarettes and mold. After we got used to the smell, we ventured in looking for this \"steak house\". When I found it, I noticed it was a cafe and not a steak house at all. We got a number and waited about 5 minutes before we were seated. \n\nWhat's funny is that while we were waiting we noticed some other younger gentleman using their phones (noticed Yelp app) and I over heard them saying \"This is the place?\" I found it amusing.\n\nMy party was already laughing at me for finding this place, and even funnier is that an a hour earlier we were seated in a 5 star steak house having appetizers.\n\nWe got seated and I told my party \"please order the prime rib or BBQ ribs, that is all that is popular on yelp.\" Against my advice 1 ordered a steak special and 1 ordered a chicken wrap. Two of use ordered the Prime rib (so glad I did). We also ordered some an appetizer entree that consisted of 3 Wings, 3 Onion Rings, 2 Potato Skins, 2 Chicken Strips, and 3 Cheese sticks. When they came, they were pretty greasy, and expected as much.\n\nI want to note that the few waiters we had were awesome, and made the trip even better. \n\nOnce the entrees came, the Prime Ribs were awesome for the price. They were juicy, had flavor and big portions. The other 2 entree's weren't that great. The chicken wrap was average and the top sirloin was over cooked in certain places and under cooked in certain places and had no flavor. The mashed potatoes tasted like dirt, so glad I wasn't the one that ordered it. \n\nAs expected the Prime Rib was awesome. If you do come please stick with that and from what I read but never tasted the BBQ ribs. It appears that's the only thing the restaurant is good for."

I feel like it should have its own space here on Yelp since it would be like reviewing Wicked Spoon under the Cosmopolitan business listing. It's located at Ellis Island but its a separate restaurant.  Anyways.. \n\nThe BBQ meats are ribs and chicken only, no choice of sides tho you do get beans, cole slaw, corn on the cob and garlic French bread with every entree. Ellis Island does have a brewery which means 20oz beers for cheap. Entrees are super reasonable and don't worry a combo rib and chicken platter will fill the heartiest of eaters and at these prices go ahead order an extra one entree to go. \n\nI was pretty blown away.. The meats were incredibly juicy, tender and tasted like the most awesome back yard BBQ. The chicken was like eating meat silk, you hardly even needed to chew since it was that soft. Ribs were meaty and just barely clung to the bone (thats a good sign for BBQ). I'd have a hard time only choosing one meat as they both were pretty dang tasty! I love the sauce too, smokey and not overly sweet! \n\nWhoa! I still have BBQ sauce in my beard, nom!"

Once we wen for breakfast before 11 am and we got steak and eggs for only 4.99, the steak was delicious and a good size, we have been there for bar-b-q and their chicken and ribs are also great and not to expensive. Make sure you get their rewards card and you will get good dinner deals too! I highly recommend it!"

Sometimes the food is great, other times not so good. If you go around dinner time expect a very long wait.\n\nTrue, they have a cheap steak dinner but you can get something equal to or better at most of the casinos. \n\nEllis Island used to have a nice outdoor BBQ restaurant. Then they moved it inside and it's a pain to get into. You have to arrive at a certain time and get a ticket out of a machine. The restaurant is so small that it fills up almost instantly.\n\nI'd rather go to a big casino or regular restaurant where it's easy to park, you can get seated right away and no hassle to get some food.

Their steak dinner is posted on the sign outside. So what do you get for $6.99? You get a steak (they'll ask you how you want it cooked), green beans and one side dish. You also get either soup or salad. You can add another $1.50 to get a beer with your meal. Our whole group ordered beer. They have other food too and I've tried their country fried steak. The gravy that they use is awesome and it feels like they take the time to craft the perfect meal. I'm pretty sure it's not healthy for you but the food is good! \n\nThe service in the restaurant is good. We didn't have to deal with any unhappy servers. In fact our server was super nice. The order was huge because of how many people were in our group. We took up 3 tables. \n\nThe atmosphere feels like this place is open 24 hours. It's dark and you are constantly hearing the sounds of the those slot machines that suck your money out of your pocket. You do smell the smoke of the cigarettes and cigars that seep their way into the restaurant. The seats are also old and dated.\n\nThe casino itself is alright if you're looking to gamble. Their prices are cheaper than other machines in the area.  Blackjack is cheaper than the main casinos so that's a plus. \n\nVisit Ellis Island and see if you like their $6.99 steak dinner! You can't beat the $6.99 price!"

The casino itself kinda sucks.... poor slot machine selection!  lol.\n\nCame here today around 7pm...  was told the wait would be about 45 min, although we were probably seated about 25 min later.  My friend and I both went with the steak special for $6.99.   Normally I'm bit of a steak snob...  and would never consider eating something like this...  I am of the opinion you can make as good or better steak at home than most restaurants (except the really good ones of course) serve for about $25.  I refuse to eat steak at places like Outback for example...  However for $6.99, who cares if it sucks.  \n\nSo, I went with the steak, medium-rare, baked potato, side salad and a root beer.  Salad was very basic...  but fresh and pretty good actually.  Root beer was delicious.  And the steak was actually pretty good.  It's a really thick cut sirlion, probably about in the 8 oz. range.  Was cooked pretty much how I ordered it (was actually kind of surprised they didn't overcook it more).  Baked potato was good and the green beens that came with it weren't bad either.  \n\nFor the price this really is a great meal.  You'd probably pay at least $15 for something similar at most \"cheaper\" restaurants, and it probably wouldn't be as good.  And they have both A-1 and heinz steak sauce if you so desire.  I'd definitely recommend ordering it mid-rare.... any more done and it would probably be a little tough...  \n\nMy friend went with the light beer instead of root beer... and thought it was awful...lol.  I didn't try it...  but maybe he just has something against light beers."

It was just so juicy (but we all know that it is just the melted ice).\n\nOverall: Great place for cheap food late at night!"

Well after finally talking them into it a few times, they now annoy me by wanting to eat every meal at Ellis Island. The steak special is a great deal and they also have good micro brewed beer. Personally, I've had the steak special so many times that I have gotten tired of it. I've been in love with their king cut prime rib and have gotten that my last few visits. It is a little more than the steak special, but you get everything you get in the steak special (including the beer) but with a huge cut of prime rib instead of a steak. They also have daily specials on a board up front.\n\nAll the waitresses have been extremely nice. I wish they would hire more of them though, since every time we've eaten here outside of extreme late night, they've been woefully understaffed."

Nearly an hour and a half and there wasn't anything else to do but be cramped in a tiny, smoky room filled with slot machines. Wait you say, how does this make it a 5 star review? Because patience my dear reader, all the pain my lungs went through to breathe in there was worth it in the end. \n\nWe were seated and promptly, the waiter proved his amazingness by taking our orders quickly and oh, he KNEW what we were there for. But to my surprise, we didn't just get a nice hunk of sirloin, green beans and our choice of potato. No sir! We were asked soup or salad? Want free house brewed root beer in tall curvy glasses? Want piping hot bread rolls and butter? What's that, did you say more bread rolls at no extra cost? \n\nSteak quality: Mine was bloody and perfect but the other gals who ordered medium rare had varying degrees of pink. Sad face! \n\nAnd to top it all off, we wanted to take our root beer home since it was so tasty. The waiter goes \"why don't you just take the glasses with you? It's Vegas and you are all beautiful ladies.\" Why HELLO, yes I think I will! Grand total = kaching ... $8 each + tax for all of the above. Holy moly. \n\nOh and don't forget this place is a brewery so they have a nice selection on tap from hefeweizen to ambers to stouts. With a steak that cheap, a nice cold one cost us a whopping $1.75 a piece. IN VEGAS. After staying at the Bellagio, all of our wallets were glad to take less of a beat down.

On their list they have: Amber ale, Hefe Weiss ale, Dark lager, Light lager and Root beer. The Amber has a strong wheat/yeast finish, somewhat similar to Sierra Nevada perhaps. The Dark reminds me of Guiness. Dark and bitter finish. And the Light lager was very refreshing and 1/3 the calories! Whoohoo. They know what they're doing!"

We also got dinner for $9.99 and it included apple cobbler. Monica at the bar was great. I don't know how she didn't lose her mind being the only bartender in the karaoke area. They also had a few contests going on like pretzel eating and stein holding. Great night for $20!\n\nAlso, Yelp was there giving out free stuff and taking pictures. Nate and Tiffany were great!"

We had a party of 12 and everyone raved about this place. My mother is a vegetarian and the wonderful Manager accommodated her and hand delivered her fish and chips to our table, which she loved. A big thank you to the Manager who was working on January 9, 2016!  We will definitely go again next time we are in town."

Ellis Island is a holdout from the days when Jerry Lewis did a telethon in sin city. 20 Bucks buys you a prime rib(14.99) or a giant pork chop dinner(8.99).  Inclusive of soup or salad, bread, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, and a LARGE 16 oz crafted draft beer. Tip included ! The bar is 3 bucks for beers, again 16 oz. Well drinks were in the vicinity of 5. \n\nThis is a local joint so don't expect debutante's in hooker heels and plastic tiaras celebrating their bridal shower. Instead saunter into the karaoke room adjacent the casino and watch some UNIQUE Local talent belt out some old school rock and roll. There is usually a long list waiting to perform. While waiting for a table for dinner I suggest you grab a beer and enjoy the show.  Or walk over to a $5 roulette table and feel like a big wheel with $50 bucks to spare.\n\nYou can walk from Planet Hollywood. It is 30 minutes though and taxi's do not frequent this area much. Uber or call for a cab if you'd rather not wait.\n\nEllis Island, Vegas economy style, or for the people watching with an appetite."

If a floor person happens to wonder by and see you, she'll probably help you out\".\n\nSeriously?\n\nWell, then I see a table games pit boss about 30 feet away from us.

Most of my friends probably thought I was taking them there as a joke, but I can honestly say that I do not have a single friend who, after having a huge breakfast at Ellis Island, does not want to go back there every single time they are in Vegas! All the breakfast items are excellent - the ham steak is bigger than a grown man's head (as are the pancakes). I recommend getting an omelet and some french toast. The prices are so cheap you can order a few things and eat what you want. Their dinner salad is also delicious - I dream about the ranch dressing! I have mixed feelings about most of their non-steak special dinner items. Their dinner cobb salad (when offered) is delicious, but all the other dinner items I've ordered (pasta, chicken sandwich, battered fish) haven't been as tasty as I'd hoped relative to the divinity of their breakfast items. Note - they stopped serving breakfast 24 hours, but there are a few breakfast items that they will make outside of breakfast hours (like the chicken fried steak with eggs). Overall it's a great place to eat breakfast, and if you like steak, a great place to get a cheap but (supposedly - according to my friends who eat beef) delicious steak and fresh green beans.\n\nOn weekends, breakfast til 2pm.

Was the food worth it?\n\nI ordered the San Gennaro (meatball) pizza, and it was not very awesome.  It probably tastes a lot better fresh and in restaurant, but by the time I got it at work, it was soggy in the middle and the sauce is lacking taste.  Meatballs weren't bad, but nobody wants soggy pizza.\n\nThe wings and fries were mildly warm, the fries a bit undercooked and had that slightly starchy taste.  I was not a fan.\n\nThe rootbeer is awesome as always though.  They send it to you w/o ice, and a cup of ice on the side, so it doesn't get watered down.  Thoughtful!  Probably shouldn't add a star for this, but I did.\n\nToo bad the rest of the experience was bad.

While the flavor was good, I got sourdough bread and it completely broke apart trying to eat it.  Would not order again.\n\nI'm quite annoyed that yet again, Ellis Island is raising the price on their beer.  It is good and cheaper than most places in town but the fact that every few months they keep raising the price makes me want to go to other places, such as Chicago Brewing Company."

They brew on the premises and the IPA is my favorite. They also have hard lemonade which I haven't tried yet.\n\nThey have a karaoke bar which is quite popular. I was there for a while and I never got to take the stage, but maybe my song got tossed (Sid Vicious' version of \"My Way\" might not have gone over very well).\n\nGambling\n\n$5 blackjack and craps tables. Well, one craps table that you may have to get them to open. I was doing pretty well last time but they shut down at 1:00 am.

Why pay $2 for a beer when they'll serve you for free?\n\nOK, so Ellis Island may lack the glamour of the Strip casinos. Do you want to actually have fun while you gamble?

The only problems are that there usually is a wait and the service is slower than molasses but I still come here. \n\nFood: steak and eggs for 5.99? Sure!  This isn't any angus beef rated steak but for the amount of money, why not eat it?  If you like your steak a little rare inside or even medium rare, ask for rare.  Why?  They cook it two ways, well done or rare.  The rare is a little pink inside and the medium rare is where their well done starts.  Not because they don't know how to cook, just because the steak is so thin.   The Sides it comes with is usually pretty decent too.\n\nService:  The service is SLOW.  I mean SUPER SLOW.  If you were waiting for your steak to cook on the sidewalk outside during the hottest day of summer in Vegas, you'd probably have a steak sooner than in this place.  They wait staff has a lot of tables to serve and they're also under staffed.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  This place is great to chill with friends while waiting for your cheap food.

Not our favorite.\nThe WEISS: Favorite! :} I'm always a fan of wheat/hefeweisen style beers, and this one was the best of their selection. Smooth, crisp with citrus notes and a pleasant overall finish. Served with a wedge of lemon. Best of the lot, but not anything worth going crazy over. \nThe STOUT: Forgettable. Dark beer, but not particularly distinquished.   \n\n+ For making their beer on site.\n+ For big, tall, ice-cold glasses of beer being $1.75\n\nWhen we finally got into the restaurant, we had our disappointment over the BBQ and then carried on. We started with their fish n' chips. Supposed to be one of their signature dishes, since way back in the day. The fish had a nice, greasy  beer batter and good flakiness on the inside. Comparable to anything you'd get at a Fish n' chipery in London? Definitely not. Still very edible, though. And the fact that it's served with malt vinegar, on a tray with newspaper, is cute and I appreciated that. \n\nAfter that came our main orders;\n\nSalads first! Iceberg lettuce drenched in dressing. 2 smallish tomatoes each, tons of croutons. Meh, Bleucheese makes any salad edible, but not noteworthy. Came with stale looking buns.  \n\nSteak  & shrimp: A surf n' turf. The steak was thin, gristly and overcooked. The shrimp were battered and fried to oblivion- burnt on the outside and were gross on the inside. The potatoes were most likely instant.\n\nRib eye special: Huge slab of pink,  tender juicy meat. Baked potato looked over-cooked and wrinkly. We still haven't touched it, days later, despite our best intentions otherwise.\n\nThe food was ok, but the only thing we'll go back for is to try the BBQ or karaoke and drink up some cheap beer. \n\nThough it was entertaining being seated next to the creepy old perverted couple, who talked dirty throughout most of the meal. Sleazy old style Vegas for you, I suppose."

Table service was decent though certainly not as prompt as I would have expected.  No overall complaints on the service provided, though.  I just find when I'm by myself having breakfast that I prefer bar service (not available here) so that I can get in and out a little faster than standard table service (a little slow).\n\nI'd originally hoped for the prime rib they had advertised but they had already run out for the day (which is completely understandable - it was about 4am in the morning after a busy Saturday night).  So instead I ordered the steak and egg breakfast combo.  The steak's flavor was really delicious - cooked perfectly (medium rare on my order) and seasoned very well.  The downside to it was that nearly half of the cut was extremely sinewy and nearly unable to be chewed.  The eggs were ordered sunny side up and delivered perfectly.  The order came with a side of toast and their breakfast potatoes which were both done just right.  Beverage service was pretty good about refilling my glass when it was empty.  Pricewise, the meal was very reasonable and I think that had I taken the time to get a member's card at the casino, I could have even saved more money on the purchase.\n\nSo the overall rating I provided is lower due to lack of service efficiency and the tough, chewy quality of part of the steak.  To be fair, I did not request a different cut of meat - I didn't want to wait for it, so I didn't give them a chance to correct the error, hence I didn't give too low of a review score, either.  I'd recommend going here and based on some of the other Yelp photos I've seen, I will likely be back to try stuff out.  Maybe the prime rib next time..."

When I say lower end, I don't mean cheap as in quality -- I am talking about bargains. Lost a lot of money on one of those rigged slot machines? Highly unlikely. Nobody in their 70\u2032s reads my blog. You probably lost money on the Black Jack tables -- maybe in a rough game of Hold'em? Either way, just because you lost al of your money, doesn't mean you can eat like you won big. Ellis Island Casino and Brewery is a small casino just barely off the strip on Koval Lane. The casino isn't much, but the restaurant and brewery inside is another story. Filled with cheap, yet quality food and beer, it is a Vegas-er's must for those on a tight budget.\n\nI had the king cut prime rib. With a side of green beans and baked potato, the dish was a great balance of protein, carb, and greens. The prime rib was bloody red and fatty. This made for a juicy cut of beef and made me happy. With the fat running down the middle and the side of ajus, this was definately a juicy everything.  Topping it all off with their horseradish made everything perfect. The name \"King Cut\" suggests that this was a uber thick cut -- it wasn't. I mean, it's no Diamond Jim Brady Cut from Lawry's. Don't get me wrong, it was still pretty thick. At then end of it all, it was a large piece of meat that had a lot of flavor. For the ridiculous price of something like $12. Considering the price, I'd say the prime rib was pretty dang thick. Just get two and you have your thicker than thick prime rib right there, for 24 bucks! Did I mention the prime rib comes with a beer? I opted for something light -- the Hefe Weiss ale was perfect. What more can I ask for than a huge prime rib and beer?\n\nEllis Island Casino and Brewery also has steak and eggs on the cheap too. For 6 bucks, you get an 8oz new york strip steak, eggs, toast, and your side of potato. The home fries were great with the eggs and toast, but the steak was the star. Of course, a lot less juicy than the prime rib, this was a true steak nonetheless. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, the lean cut of beef was at its purest. Did I dare ask for some A-1 sauce? I don't care what you say, that stuff is liquid gold. Not like we are at a fancy shmancy place. But really, for 6 bucks you get all this? Only in Vegas.\n\nI guess you can lose all your money in Vegas and still come out on top. Imagine if this same establishment, minus the casino came to Los Angeles, That would be nut! The same thing at a Denny's or Sizzler would be double the price. You just can't have this anywhere else but in Las Vegas. Ellis Island Casino as a casino is pretty run down. If you don't want to play bingo here, you can always play online. I don't really play bingo. I'm not my mother-in-law, you know, but when I'm in the mood and to find the best bingo sites, I use ballsupbingo.com. All in all though, the food and the beer was excellent. Just lose everything on black, but keep $20. Restaurants on the strip is most likely not worth it anyways."

On our most recent bachelor party trip, the bachelor made it a priority to stop by for their amazing sandwiches but much to our surprise, they swapped out the sandwich shop for a mediocre taco stand (del taco and t-bell are better)! Until you guys bring back the sandwiches, we will be taking our money to Fremont street for our off the strip gambling adventures."

They actually gave you a real steak that was from a grill !!!! My steak was medium rare and came out prefect! The flavor was great and the steak isn't thin and cheap like what you would expect from a steak and eggs special. What I love about this meal other then the awesome price it was because it wasn't covered with oil or butter!!!! The casino is very small and I wanted to play craps but their is only one crap table but it was closed. They only open it at 5pm for a few hours because it's not busy there.

I'm sorry to say that the charm thing didn't work the next day when I came back with a group of 8 dudes, but the full price is just a couple bucks more and it's TOTALLY worth it.  Those ribs are some of the best I've ever had and the BBQ sauce is delicious.  They keep the ribs in this smoker all day and then just grill em up right when you order them.  They're delicious and just fall off the bone.  The chicken is cooked perfectly too, although the white meat can get a little dry if you don't eat it right away.  \n\nOver the course of the two meals I had here I ate 1.5 chickens and a full rack of ribs, plus 2 containers of bbq sauce.  \n\nIt's a shame I wasn't there for valentine's day.

I chose a Belgian-type beer that tasted like Blue Moon and poured in a tall pint.  Delicious!  \n\nOur party of 4 rolled out very satisfied with a bill of $36 which included tip!!!

The waiter was kind enough to notify us if we want to wait another hour for outside (where the grill is located and you constantly inhale the aroma) or inside where you can eat NOW!!! I chose to eat now!!!\n\nI would defintely wait the 2 hours again!!!"

Vegas exists to try and take your money, so it's like a game to do what you want but give them as little of your money as you can.\n\nEnter Ellis Island.  A block away off the strip, right behind our hotel, Bally's.  But that block is LONG in 100 degree heat.  And one block behind the strip is noticeably downscale.  Still, once in the casino you fell the old Vegas vibe, and it's comfy.\n\nA few websites had informed of the $6.99 steak special, which isn't on the menu.  It's a TON of food -- salad, bread, and a big piece of steak with fries (or mashed) and green beans.  Now this steak is never going to win any awards biut it was perfectly acceptable if a little overcooked.  I only ate the parts that were cooked to my liking and that was enough.  We were stuffed.\n\nThe best part was when the bill came.  $15.00!!!!!!   This was less than we were to pay for any breakfast later in our trip.\n\nEveryone should come here for one meal!"

Really?!? \n\nI think a lot of the time people go into a place with really low expectations and then when a place is better than they expected they think it is better than it is and rate it higher than they should. That has to be the case with the restaurant at Ellis Island. \n\nThat's not to say the place isn't good because it is. I went there this past weekend when we were looking for a cheap steak and someone recommended this place. When we arrived we noticed that there was a big food truck festival out front. You would think with everyone eating from the trucks that the restaurant would be empty, but much to my surprise there was still a 30 minute wait for a table. \n\nTurned out that was good cause it gave me time to get a tetanus shot which should be required upon entering the building. After checking out the food truck festival and chatting with people at the Yelp booth I sat down at a video poker machine to gamble for a little bit until the table was ready. True story, one of the girls from the Yelp table took a break and came over to where I was playing video poker and hit on me! Awesome!! (for the record she was cute as hell, but I had other plans for that night). \n\nOkay, back to the review. When they finally got around to seating us and after looking at the menu we decided on the fillet special. For $7.99 you get a steak, vegetable, choice of potato, soup or salad and one of their homemade beers or root beer. \n\nI chose the salad, which legally qualified as salad because it had lettuce. Don't expect much from it though, it is literally lettuce, salad dressing, 2 cherry tomatoes and nothing else. It was fine, but nothing special. \n\nWhen the dinner came, I was a little disappointed in the vegetable offering. The special came with green beans, but I don't like green beans so I asked if there was another vegetable offering and the waiter offered to replace the green beans with the mixed vegetable which turned out to be more green beans with some corn and carrots mixed in. I didn't try them. My friend had the green beans and initially said they were good, but then didn't eat them, so take from that what you will. \n\nThe baked potato was perfectly fine. It's kinda hard to mess up a baked potato and they didn't. \n\nThe steak was a very pleasant surprise. I honestly didn't expect much from a $7.99 steak in this kind of place, but it was very good. Tender, no real gristle cooked exactly as I had ordered it. I ate every bite and was very satisfied by it. \n\nHaving major drinking plans for later that night, we just got the root beer as our drink. I have to say, the homemade root beer was damned tasty. And I highly recommend that! \n\nThe service was okay, but we weren't offered any dessert. \n\nThe atmosphere was like a Coco's that hasn't been updated in 30 years and was quite loud. \n\nSo look, is the place bad? Definitely not! \n\nIs it worthy of 4-stars? Absolutely not! \n\nWas it the best $7.99 steak I have ever had? YES! \n\nI can't say I would go back and I can't say that I would recommend it, but I wouldn't avoid going back and wouldn't tell anyone else to avoid it either."

Thankfully, we did not and he asked where we were headed.  We said that we had wanted to grab some breakfast before our family activities and he said, \"Forget the buffets, go down the street to Ellis Island!  I swear it's a local favorite and the only place I take my visiting friends and relatives for breakfast.\" \n\nSo we decided to take this stranger's advice and headed a bit off the Strip to what seemed to be a very depressing, realistic and non-glitzy part of Vegas.  But we braved the smokey filled casino and headed towards the restaurant in the back.  Needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised at the level of friendly service and delicious food.  Steak and eggs for $5?  Surely you jest.  But the steak was made to order, the eggs were tasty... actually, everything was tasty.  We could overhear people in other booths around us saying how this was the only place they ate breakfast whenever they were visiting, or how some were actually locals.  \n\nSo thanks, George, for recommending this place.  We'll hit it up again the next time we're through your part of the world."

Whether it be breakfast, lunch, dinner, or late night meal after clubbing... its always good.  However, it does depend on where you go.  We usually go to Ellis Island because the steak & eggs is cheap and usually good.  I prefer the steak & eggs from Tuscany but they only serve it at a cheap price super late at night-early morning...but anyways here is my review for the food.\n\nI ordered steak and eggs.  I asked for my meat medium rare, sunny-side up and wheat slices of bread.  Nothing to complain about it.  My steak was cooked to how I wanted it to be and there was barely any fatty pieces to it which is a definite plus.  I hate when I ordered steak somewhere and a good portion of my meat is actually just fat... so stars for that! Plus, even though the size of the meat was small, it was actually really thick so it filled me up quick!  However I do I wish they gave more potatoes with my meal because I LOVE POTATOES.  I always eat some of my boyfriends too because I finish mine so fast. lol  \n\nI usually can never finish everything so my boyfriend finishes whats leftover for me :)  (That's what boyfriends are for! hehe jk :)) \n\nService is usually okay.. This past weekend however, we came during dinner time on a Sat night and the food took pretty long for it come out which was a bummer because I was starving! But its okay, understandable since we did have to wait for a table and all, meaning they were busier than when we usually come. \n\nIf you're craving a cheap but good meal, come to Ellis Island for steak and eggs! (:\nI'm not sure about the other items on the menu because I've only gotten the same thing everytime I've come."

I'm a big eater and it was totally full and couldn't eat lunch during the day, just held out to dinner.  Lunch you must try their 50/50 burger which is Angus and Bacon!!

Dinner I had one of the best prime rib dinners ever.  I've gone to a lot of steak houses but this place at $15 is an absolute steal and deliciousness.  Give it the top award for value and flavor hands down.  Sorry Ruth Chris.  It is between a 16-20 ounce cut and cooked to perfection.

The Chinese cafes around here offer $5 steaks and that comes with pasta, steamed veggies, soup and salad. I guess in Vegas, $6 steak is a big whoop so I landed here with a large group around 4am after a night of partying.\n\nOur server was nice and patient. I ordered a medium rare steak with over easy eggs. While the eggs were cooked perfectly, my steak came out medium well. The steak was too dry. I was not going to send a $6 steak back at 4:30am so I ended up putting a lot of sauce on it to make it palatable.\n\nThe worst part is the asshole security guy who was rude to me. I walked in with my shoes on and took them off under the table because I had been wearing them clubbing all night. He was reprimanding someone else who walked through the casino barefooted and saw my feet under the table and started pointing at my face and raised his voice at me to put my shoes on. I, remaining true to my nature, gave him some choice words about his rudeness and utilized appropriate profanity to make sure he was clear about my anger level. Luckily for him he backed off before I went even more ape shit on him.\n\nAm I coming back here? If I find myself with another group of 20 and they want to come, sure I would force myself to come back. I, however, will not be suggesting this place or have any desire to come back."

I also really like the BBQ restaurant they have here, unfortunately it doesn't open until 4pm on weekends. This review is for the cafe only\n\nMy aunt was in town staying at Harrah's, and we decided to come here for lunch since it is right down the street from her hotel. The wait on a Saturday afternoon for 4 was a little over 45 minutes. Our server was OK. My aunt ordered a club sandwich and fries well done, but the fries came out cold and soggy. My mother's fries were cold as well. When we told our waitress she said she would get us a fresh basket. Great =) She comes back not 2 minutes later and says \"I got you a new basket, but I don't know if they will be any better than the other ones.\" Dafuq? And they were not any better than the fries we got the first time. Whyyyyyy wouldn't she just get us a fresh basket?? Super lame.I had the steak and eggs, mom had the fish and chips and grandma had a chef salad. \n\nOther than the fry incident, we were all satisfied with our meals. Nothing memorable about this place, just convenient to where my aunt was staying, and off the strip so that is always a plus!\n\nYelp 2015 Review #38"

I came here on Mother's Day and it had an hour and a half wait time, my boyfriend and I were about to give up but then realized that the Karaoke Bar next door also served the same food with NO WAIT! Only real difference was that there was no table service - you had to order and pick up at the bar but there was plenty of booth seating all around. The bartender was a one woman show and she was amazing - juggling a room of 25-30 people by herself.\n\nWhat we got - \n- Country fried chicken $8. My boyfriend ordered this and it was delicious! Probably one of the better chicken fried steaks I've had. The chicken was cut thick and moist.\n\n- NY Strip Steak and eggs special $6.99. I order this medium well and got it done correctly on one end and well done on the other, not a huge deal, still really good and not burnt or dry.\n\n- Biscuits and gravy $4. SOOOOO moist and soft. An order comes with two biscuits smothered with sausage gravy and should be shared with a table of 4 or more lol"

The heffeweizen, amber and IPA were served in plastic cups, and all of the beers were very monotone in flavor with little to distinguish them. All also had a slightly off aftertaste.  There were booths on the side of the casino to sit in. It was a Thursday so pizza was 1/2 priced, but it was just ok also.  Overall, very mediocre and while sitting in the 'nonsmoking' section for ~10minutes I started getting a head ache because the little casino had really poor ventilation.

As soon as I put my name on the list they called out numbers 32, 33, and 34. My husband wanted ribs so we decided to go get him ribs over at the BBQ spot since we had so much time to wait. Well they told u. s it would be an hour and a half. Instead he decided he would eat at the other restaurant with me. After gambling for abput an hour we finally heard our number so we went over to the restaurant and were seated. Our waiter seemed a little slow (and I don't only mean his speed) but we read the menu and were happy to see such a great selection and great prices. I ordered the club sandwich which was delicious and my husband ordered the chicken fried steak which was actually pork. He was aprehensible at first but decided to go with it anyways and he loved it. He kept saying how full he was then he would take another bite until the whole thing was gone. The food was good but I also think the down to earth atmosphere made our time at ellis island and enjoyable experience."

Everyone was happy with their food, and the meal cost less than any other we had in Vegas.\n\nThe only reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 is that the service left a little to be desired. The staff was friendly, but we waited a while at the beginning for anyone to stop at the table, even after trying to get the attention of several servers (who walked past us quickly with their head down if they noticed we needed attention). Once we had the food it was hard to get attention to get the right sauces we wanted, and then we were told he would have to charge us for it (which he later did not do, because he could see I wasn't happy about that).

You can't go wrong eating the $3.99 steak special! Be aware: the restaurant gets really crowded late at night. You will have to wait for a table, and the service is slower than molasses.  So don't go here if you are in a hurry to get to bed!\n\nI was most recently here during the day for the Food Truck Mash-Up, and what a blast!  Unfortunately, I only got to eat at 2 of the 4 trucks - I was just too full to try any others! Ellis Island was serving their own brews for only $1.75, what a deal! \n\nTo me, this is the kind of place that \"Old Vegas\" was all about. Cheap food, nice people and low limit tables (they have $3 blackjack).  I send all of my friends from out of town here, because not everyone wants to spend hundreds of dollars on some drunk food! :)"

Sat down with my guy at the back bar. Robo,  the day bartender got let go for some petty reason, like a lot of other long time employees. We sat at the bar and waited as the new grey haired bartender guy waited on everyone that was at the bar, even new people that came in. But, he totally ignored me and my guy. He could see that we had our Ellis Island club cards out and had printed out our club coupons. We sat there & sat there as this bartender walked past us several times, making sure to never make eye contact. After about 10 minutes, we spoke up to try to get his attention. He refused to acknowledge us! We gave up & went to the other bar where we were greeted & served immediately. That bartender remembers us & knows we moved here from Hawaii. As always, he received a generous tip when we left. But, we will never return. We do not need to be desrespected by being refused service. Ellis Island has turned into a dump. Be warned. Stay away! The employees give off bad and discriminatory vibes! This place needs shut down!"

Our server was especially busy but always smiling and friendly. The NY steak & egg special was $6.99, and came with toast and potatoes.\n\nThe steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, juicy, but still had a good amount of fat/gristle. The potatoes taste like Jack in the Box curly fries, but in square boxy form. Yum. The eggs were fine and the toast was buttered and ... toasty?\n\nOrange juice will run you north of $3 and soda about $2.

I must say that the first couple of singers had dark sides to them...Sound Garden, Metallica, etc... I instantly knew this was not a happy let's sing pop and love songs kind of crowd. This was pretty dark hard core singing. I was just amazed that the screaming and voices were dead on. It was a little refreshing for me, then the typical singers I encounter.\n\nThe bartenders were a little disconnected. It seems like they were making drinks for other people outside the bar. There was a secret window where \"OPD\" went...what you don't know what that means? Okay fine \"Other Peoples Drinks!\" Now are you down with me? It was like you needed a road flare to get there attention and I was sitting at the bar. Plus there is a 10 buck min for a tab on credit card. Also do not start a tab with the waitress and then order a drink from the bartender because they do not work well together. Okay as I'm writing this sober I'm realizing this paragraph deserves like one star.\n\nI need to get back to my happy spot...good cold fresh micro brew beer flowing from taps behind the bar. I wish the tap was on my side.  I also wish the bathroom was closer because I needed to return the beer back to nature. So I went on my walk through the casino. I loved it. As I walked around, I noticed 5 buck blackjack...it was over $25 back at our big casino on the strip. I love that these little places have low starting limits. If I was Mayor of Funtown I would make a law that said there will be no set table bets. Hey if I wanna gamble a buck why can't I? Why are you forcing me to lose more money?\n\nI think this place is a find and I can hardly wait to come back here but I'm going to need to start working on some dark songs to sing or I might get kicked out."

That's pretty damn bad ass. \n\nThe lighting hurt my head, the smell hurt my head, the A1 sauce i smothered my steak in to mask the actual flavor of the meat hurt my head, body, and emotional disposition. For actual food, 2 stars. For price and value, 4. Average of 3 starz 4 u hoes"

The ribs/BBQ area is also delicious, cheap, and always packed.  The NY pizza joint is supposedly run by actual New Yorkers, and it's great too.\n\nGambling takes the form of a bank of slot machines (that pay actual coins!  holy crap!), a few low limit blackjack tables, a roulette table, and a craps table.  (I'm sad they got rid of the mini-craps table and replaced it with a full sized one, though.)  Come here if you want to kill some time gambling but don't want to melt your wallet.  There's also a small but comfy sports book, so if you're here with gambler friends and all you want to do is watch the game/race/whatever, there's a place for that too.\n\nAs one might expect from the name, they brew their own beer (and root beer, and egg nog during the holidays) and it is all excellent.  And at $1 a glass (or free if you're gambling, of course), you absolutely cannot go wrong.  You can also take home half gallon \"little brown jugs\" for later enjoyment.  Try the heffie; you won't regret it.\n\nOnly downside is that this place kind of has the \"old\" Vegas feel to it, so it's kind of dark and smoky.  But, every place in Vegas is smoky to a degree, so you get used to it I guess."

It was busy and when it was my turn I ordered the BBQ Chicken with no tomatoes and lettuce. She took my order and my coupon and did not ask me what my name was. I stood there the whole time watching what was the so called Manager make all the sandwiches. It was apparent that there was no more chicken to make the rest of the BBQ Chicken sandwich orders and he told his employee that he is going to be out of chicken. So I stood there to see if I was one of them that might not get my BBQ Chicken due to the sudden lack of chicken. I walked a way for a few minuets to ask my friends if they wanted my free beverage because I don't do beer and root beer. They said yes and I went back to ask the not so friendly cashier if I could have a half root beer half light beer and also asked her how much longer will i have to wait. She asked my name and when I told her Jon she said that they have been calling me for the past 10 mins. I told her how could that be because I have been standing her watching for the past 10 mins and no one called me to tell me that there would be no more chicken. I explained to all of them that the manager told the other person about the lack of chicken for the rest of the orders but no one called me to tell me. They also messed up on an order for the BBQ chicken sandwich. This gentlemen was supposed to get a whole and they made him a half. The bottom line is they messed up and did not want to admit to their mistake. If the cashier did call my name she is blind as a bat because I was standing right there to her right of her cash register the whole time and she never called me. Their solution was to call the casino security to have me removed. They tried to offer me a free item off their menu. They told my friends brother that they would be happy to make me anything off their menu. They could not come up to me to apologize or face me in person. Right before we left Ellis Island the cashier passed me to go to the restroom and gave me such a dirty look. I hope the owners read this and do something to correct the attitudes of their employees. They have no reason to call me a liar."

Knowing how much the husband loves beer, I figured this would be a win.\n\nSo now that I have spent the last two and a half hours there waiting around in the bar (getting lung cancer most likely from all the secondhand smoke) getting him buzzed on $2 house brewed HefeWeizen, having two fights because he was in bitch mode prior to said beers, and people watching before and after dinner I have to say this was exactly the experience I was looking for.\n\nI got the steak special - a 10 oz filet with a salad or soup, green beans, choice of potato and a beer for $8.99 if you have the coupon (it's $12.99 without). I didn't realize we needed to have a coupon so our waiter went looking for one and gave it to me (score!).  Hubby had the final two B's in his dining trifecta - beef & bacon (the 50/50 burger with ground bacon and more bacon+ cheese on top). He had my beer since I don't drink beer.  My meat was perfectly cooked, the green beans were fantastic, and the burger....I will never eat a normal burger again.\n\nTotal damage for this meal: $18.54 with tax and alcohol + and iced tea.  I threw our waiter a significant tip for hooking me up with the coupon (basically I gave him the difference in price in the two plus what I would've normally tipped).\n\nI heartily recommend this establishment. Life IS great at the Super 8.  It's how seedy I remember Vegas being prior to being taken over my rich beautiful young people who have shitty taste in music (EDM) and who feel then need to coin the term 'Day Clubs\" rather than night club because God Forbid you have to wait until dark to party!\n\nAnd now I have to close my eyes because I have a food coma starting."

So obviously we were like \"oh let's just Yelp a place - Yelpers never fail.\" Well you guys failed us. (4 star average with 300+ reviews?!?!?!!? COME ON) \n\nThe majority of our group ordered the steak special. While we weren't expecting a legendary tasting steak, we also weren't expecting what it turned out to be. A medium rare steak was as tough as nails with little to no flavor -  I had to douse my chunk with A1 sauce to make it bearable. The side salad was loaded with dressing, most likely to hide its age and brown spots. What's the point of eating a salad when all its supposed benefits are negated by an exorbitant amount of dressing? The beer it came with tasted stale and watered down. I literally have nothing positive to say about this place. Even the price that you all rave about doesn't make it worth coming to. I hate McDonalds but would have preferred it over this junk. And don't even get me started about the service.\n\nLong story short: only come here if you hate yourself."

I had the wild Alaskan salmon which I was happy to see on the menu (most restaurants use cheaper and less healthful farmed Atlantic salmon), I wanted it to be left a tiny bit rare in the center, which they almost accomplished, that's ok though it was good, and salmon can be difficult to get perfect. My wife had a burger, requested it as rare as they would make it, and they accomodated by bringing her a rare burger. This surprised me. I don't do rare ground meats unless I am certain about the source, but that is my wife's preference, she said it was good, but a bit bland. I think I have spoiled her by feeding her only grass-fed beef or game meat burgers at home.\n\nAs for the house brews, I tried the amber (or 3 or 4) as that sounded like the most flavorful offering available at the time. It was a good amber with a hint of hoppiness, I would have loved to have had something with more hops but was satisfied, especially at the super low price for a decent pint of beer. I think it was $2 or less. My wife tried the homemade Root Beer, and said it was great. I had a taste and it tasted like a pretty good sweet root beer.\n\nBy the time we finished dinner the karaoke lounge was packed, we sat in the smoke and looke at the songbooks for a little while. I love a good karaoke spot, this place has good music choices, but unless you already smoke like 2 packs a day, the thick smoke in the air is going to kill your throat before you get a chance to sing. The regular older elvis guy was kinda funny. The other thing I would change if the ventalation could be addressed, is the sound system volume. It seems it was tuned up for those already hearing impaired or looking to become such, my ears were ringing after about 20 minutes. Perhaps if we got there earlier we could have found a spot near the air inlet and a little farther away from the speakers and got a song or two in before we left. Will try again next trip."

It's not on the strip but very close to it and you can't beat the $9.99 steak dinner which also includes a beer!\nIf you make it before 11am you get the meal for $6.99!! \nThe casino is not much to look at to be honest but I enjoy the old school vibe and the older crowd. \n\nThey have karaoke , blackjack , slots , great food  plus they brew their own beer!! \n\nMy husband and I make it a point to come here every time we are in Vegas... can't beat the price for a full meal and the atmosphere!"

The first night was impressive- delicious steak dinner with excellent salad, sides, etc. The second visit the food was not so good- overcooked steak, extremely slow service (30 minutes to get our drinks) even after me going up to the server 3 different times while being polite saying 'hey, we're still waiting for our drinks... should we just go up to the bar?' She only had 4 tables to service and was the slowest and most inefficient server I've ever had in my life lol. Based on feedback from my friends and other reviews- I guess this is a hit or miss place. Even though it's an incredible food deal, I don't know if I'll be back if ever in Vegas again because the wait/service is terrible."

It's a rather small establishment, the restaurant and its adjacent casino, but it offers cheap eats that I have to admit are decent quality. I almost feel I should be paying a little more for the portions and well yea including an in house brewed beer too, think I'm robbing them but hey I pay whats on the presented bill. \n\nThe wait I have heard can be atrocious, though I cannot comment on such since when I arrived I joined a party that had already been seated.

Superb.\n\nThe casino itself is small, but varied, and there's always a few open spots. Slots, blackjack, roulette, you name it. My only reservation is that the roulette table seems a bit off-set. The histogram for the past 10 spins had like four 00's, and that's statistically unlikely with a properly-set roulette. The cigarette smoke also doesn't help with keeping the machines well-serviced.\n\nI'm incredibly glad that I went off the beaten path, and stopped by Ellis Island. It's not a tourist trap, for sure."

The price was amazing: two 16 oz beers cost me like $4.50.  ( They were inexpensive but my memory may not be perfect on the dollar amount.)  The casino was alright.  Lots of alternative lifestyle people there.  Everyone was very friendly.  The providing of paper cups near the door, so when you wanted to move on you could pour your beer into them and leave the glass cups behind, was a thoughtful touch."

My intention is to make you aware of both in case you venture off the strip and go here. \n\nThe good. \nThe drinks are cheap. Karaoke is fun. The regulars are cool and supportive. This is a great place to go if you want to do something different in Vegas. \n\nThe bad. \nThe alcohol experience is NOT consistent. The waitress told me they didn't have Bud Light and a few hours later someone in my party got served one. WTF\nWhen your waitress takes her sweet ass time getting to you, you can't go to the bar to get your own drink. They will turn you away and tell you to wait for your waitress. WTF\nThey over carbonate their home brewed beers so you WILL get a stomach ache. This is total BS. \nThe girl running the karaoke runs it like a Nazi on speed. She constantly is dancing and singing the songs but if you do anything like stop singing or whatever she will start slamming things and yelling \"Sing! Sing god dammit!\" And then chastise you. She did this to me because at the end of my song I thanked the crowd for being awesome and thanked the bar for being cool. Once she did this I turned to her and said \"Go F yourself\" and walked off the stage.  I seriously think she was on a log of drugs. She also made a long \"2nd grade teacher yelling at the class\" speech about how this is the best karaoke bar in the world and everyone needs to recognize or they should get out. What an ass. WTF\nThere is NO BATHROOM IN THIS PLACE. You need to walk all the way to the back corner of the complex. WTF\nAnd Finally - good luck finding your song in the karaoke book. Roger Miller is under M - Steve Miller is under S. They have more Steel Dragon songs than The Monkees. You'd like to think a karaoke nazi would have been more attentive to these details but I guess she's just not that good of a karaoke nazi."

The drinks and food are cheap.. I bought 6 drinks & we got drunk using just about $50... When you sing on stage you get an awesome adrenaline rush and the crowd cheers you on. No booing or any negativity here which takes some of the pressure off.. Great sound system and lots of screens with the lyrics...

The beers here are beers Don't come in here thinking you're going to have a killer brew. It serves its purpose for the price so complain if you are getting charged a ton of money for crappy beer but to complain about a 20oz beer for $2...not I sir. I pretty much tried all the brews and stuck with the stout. Surprisingly it had a very pleasant, roasty flavor that finished smooth.  The following night we came back with my group to try out the prime rib and other specials on the menu. This place again did not disappoint! We had lots of food for a super great price and YES it was delicious. We had the chicken fried chicken as a warm up for our table and we all enjoyed the super moist and tasty chicken with the fries and slaw. The coating on the chicken is like no other I've tried it was seasoned very well and was delicate enough to crumble but still very crunchy and very flavorful. I had the prime rib and it was cooked just like I asked for it. The horseradish was very strong but I like it that way! The rest of my group had steak and shrimp and they couldn't stop asking us to try their steak and shrimp because they loved it so much. Our server was top notch and friendly, funny and very attentive. We ate there around 9:30 pm and waited for about an hour. The rest of us while we waited for the table headed over to the bar for some beers and karaoke! It was fun watching the locals hang out. We sang along with the crowd and felt very welcomed. After a few beers and whiskey shots we headed over for dinner. Had a fantastic time and even took home some casino money after dinner playing roulette! The place could use some good ventilation or air circulation it did get pretty smoky at times. Other than the smokers the restrooms are kind of a walk from the caf\u00e9 and the bar. I have to say I'm going to keep on coming back and plugging this spot as long as they keep treating me the same. \nPros- food is fantastic and very affordable, beer is affordable, staff is friendly\nCons- can get quite smoky"

Unfortunately, I speak a little spanish and on top of that, I spoke to the other customers and confirmed her actions. Netty (Nerry?) was so rude to me and i would not normally complain ....but because she completely embarrassed me and my friends I felt compelled to complain to someone. I was told by many other employees that this would not be taken into any consideration because Sal is having an affair Netty (Nerry?). I gamble a lot at this casino and spend a lot of money on table games and restaurants. So when I did complain to Sal, I felt comfortable he would take care of the situation, as he promised. Suddenly, several hours later, as I am still gambling, I am told by security that I am no longer welcome at ellis Island. Even the security officer that knows me was confused and shocked. I asked him to tell me why I am 86ed. He could not. Only stating they needed a cooling off period of 3-6 months. I am still confused why? So tonight.....4 months later, I was greeted by security with a welcome and continued to have  pizza at metro and never left the restaurant except to go to the bathroom. I was then greeted outside the bathroom by the same security that had  welcomed me and was told to leave......again. I still do not know why i have been singled out and abused. This casino is a joke. One cocktail waitress controls the whole place. Many employees are so afraid of losing their pathetic jobs and or repercussions from Sal because he is having a relationship with Netty (Nerry?).

Not the best steak I'd ever had (though really, it wasn't half-bad, other than it was kind of raw in the center, so I had to throw a couple bites out), and certainly not the best service, but definitely the best 5 dollar steak I've ever had, and the best service I've ever had at a place that sold steak for 5 dollars. \n\nI would say, don't come here if you're in a hurry, but do come here if you aren't. \n\np.s. if you enjoy semisweet-to-sweet wines, which we do, and you aren't a total wine snob, which we aren't, you will absolutely love their house blush (which we did) - especially given it's also crazy cheap at 3 dollars a glass."

The wait was about a half hour for 2 people, but there are seats for you to sit while you wait.\n\nFood: The portions were hearty. I had the Chicken Fried Steak (delicious but heavy on the salt and pepper) with mashed potatoes, salad, and mixed vegetables for $8.99. The husband had a 10 oz steak with beer, salad, mashed potatoes, and green beans. He said the beer was good. (This place also is a microbrewery.) I also had a slice of apple pie (for $3.99). There was a slight fishy smell (as if it was placed next to a bowl of steamed shrimp) and portions of the slice were either really warm or really cold, but that didn't bother me because I really did enjoy my dinner overall. :)\n\nAtmosphere: The area around the establishment isn't as clean/safe as the Strip, so just be aware of your surroundings. It's not dangerous though. \n\nService: Our server was Carol. She was quick, accommodating, friendly, and helpful.\n\nBottom line: I'd give this place a 4.5 but I'm rounding up to 5. (The -0.5 was for the atmosphere and the multi-temperature and fishy smelling apple pie.) The best thing about this place are the prices and portions. (Great value for your money!) It is a nice relief from the overpriced fare on the Strip. This place definitely is a hidden gem, and there is a very high likelihood I shall be returning."

My only other complaint aside from the scenery is that you cant bring in the food from the rib place to the restaurant area, which got on my nerves because we had children with us who only wanted ribs, yet they were on the menu in the restaurant?     \n\nThere's two separate eating areas, one for bbq ribs and one that's just like a restaurant, which confused the hell out of me because if it's in the same casino area, why be so stingy?

I had the worst time in Vegas for a long time! \n\nAtmosphere 3/5: The restaurant has a nice old bar/pub kind of atmosphere. It's a descent place to go.\nFood 3/5: I've been for there many years and I always invited my friends and family at this restaurant for their steak special. I have tried the fish and chips but the steak is really the way to go. Unfortunately, adding to the terrible service last time, the food was mediocre! My steak which needed to be medium was well done which changed the entire experience foodwise! I didn't even finish my plate since it felt like the steak was just not eatable. I'm giving a 3-stars for food only because I am a regular and I know how good the steak can be.\nService 0/5: 0/5? This is the worst service I ever had and I'm usually not giving any name but Eugene, despite trying to be polite, was NOT doing his job right. We had the bad luck to get seated in a confusing area for the waiters there. We had to wait 20 minutes to have our order taken. Yes I asked meanwhile to at least 4-different waiters to take our order or bring our server to the table etc... I even asked the elderly lady working for a long time who seats people to bring our server but NOTHING!!! Wow! Finally, Eugene came to take out order meanwhile saying that he didn't know where our server was. Now, the problem was that they had a miscommunication between waiters on how many tables they needed to take care and we were the exact table that brought confusion in their team. Fantastic! Thinking that this experience, I decided to give a chance to this server but I quickly learned my lesson after the 2nd time! Eugene brought our salad after 5 minutes but we had to wait 25 minutes to get those steaks. Meanwhile, you couldn't find him or if he was in the dining room, he was horrible at making sure his tables were all alright! Now the ironic thing was that people who took their order after us got their food before us! 25 minutes later and literally only 7 tables left in the Dining room, we get our steak and you know the rest... Overcooked & uneatable!\n\nOverall, I've worked in restaurant and I understand that miscommunication can happen in the team but I don't understand why a customer needs to pay the price of your mistakes and wait 20 min for an order to be taken! Even if that's not your table, you get that f*cking take that order and pass it to the right server! It's gonna take me a long before I get back if I get back!"

Inside the place is dark, a little dingy and kind of ghetto coming from staying at Encore but surprisingly busy.  Back to the deal, all you need is someone to sign up for the players card and they will get a coupon for the whole table to enjoy a $9 dinner of Sirloin steak, baked potato, garlic green beans and a beer. Freaking crazy deal! \n\nOur server Eugene was extremely friendly and gave us some tips on what to do with our time there and didn't make a stink face when I sent my overcooked steak back for another one.  My 2nd steak was a perfect medium rare and at $9 was better than I expected.   The other sides weren't anything special but better than nothing.  \n\nWhile you're waiting get a $2 beer at the bar."

Old decor, run down tables, and plugged with ripped red vinyl.  It kinda has the feel of what you would get if you crossed an old folks home for cigarette smokers with a casino.  At 36, I was well below the average age by a couple decades.  Not exactly \"happening\"..\n\nAnyways, during the long wait for our table (suprising considering the number of empty tables at the restaurant) we attempted to order a beer at the bar but got yelled at by the bartender for apparently daring to tread on the oh so sacred ground of the \"server station\".\n\nB$%## bartender aside, the hef was delicious - I don't normally go for foofier beers like that, but it really hit the spot, and at 1.75 for a 20 ounce microbrew, you just can't go wrong.\n\nOnce we got seated, our server didn't really speak english, but that was fine since apparently nobody orders anything but the prime rib there anyways.  I ordered my prime rib rare and it came out damn near still cold, so I was happy with that aspect of it, but I was not happy with the fact it was about 60%fat and gristle, and only about 40 percent actual meat.  The others at my table got better cuts tho, and hey, for 13 bucks including a 20 oz beer, you can't really complain.\n\nAl in a, a decent deal, and the beer we had was exceptionally good.  I'd eat there again."

Step 1: sign up for the players card. Step 2: play at least a dollar with the club card. Step 3: go to a kiosk, swipe your card, and print a voucher for a $8.99 steak & microbrew. Then go eat. \n\nOn my last visit I hadn't known that the off-menu special was now off the off-menu and the waitress was kind enough to give me an extra voucher to use, but you can't always count on them being able to help you out. The meal is worth the extra hoops to jump through. If you're not a drinker, you can get a house-made root beer in place of a microbrew. \n\nThe EI also has cheap pizza, cheap ribs, and a cheap steak and eggs special if you don't want to deal with the players card. The restaurant is frequently busy because it's cheap and good. But the place is a total dump.

You can get a pretty bomb and fulfilling meal over here for no more than $10-$15 including tip.  This place reminds me a lot of Black Bear Diner in Gilroy with their generous proportions that help contribute to America's gluttony.  -  Great alternative from paying $30-$40 for a buffet or just picking up some fast food on the strip.  They serve toast with butter or jelly with most meals here.  And mostly everything is or at least looks good over here.  Pretty bomb place to get your grub on for breakfast or lunch I'd say.\n\nThere's usually not much of a wait over here, but you can always test your luck at some slots, craps, or black jack located right next to this diner.  The casino is pretty small, but I think they had low $5 or $10 minimum tables over here.  There's a 7 Eleven right next door too I think if my memory is that good."

Doesn't hurt that the beers crafted in house are only $1.75.\n\nIs this the best steak you'll ever have? Heck no. But where else can you regularly get soup or salad to start, and a filet cut top sirloin with choice of potato and green beans for $8? Nowhere, I tell you. The best part about this deal? It comes with a free beer (or rootbeer.. get a beer, sissy). And their beers are pretty darn good.\n\nI personally love the taste of sirloin. I think filet mignon is overrated in everything but it's tenderness (ribeye.. that is all.) The sirloin at Ellis is hit or miss, really, both in preparation and in quality. Sometimes I've gone and it's been tender, and sometimes my jaw is sore by the end of dinner. I usually order medium-rare and it's usually medium or medium-well, occasionally rare, and once in a blue moon, cooked correctly. The green beans are fresh green beans and are sometimes still crisp, and sometimes really mushy and buttered with loads of fresh garlic. The baked potato is standard, and the mashed potatoes come with gravy that is much like cafeteria gravy and is oddly satisfying in that way.. steak fries are steak fries. The soups change day to day and range from chili to New England clam chowder (surprisingly good). The salads are your standard iceberg romaine carrot purple cabbage mix with croutons and cherry tomatoes, but their Italian dressing is made in house and it is bangin'.\n\nOther dishes: Orange Roughy - delicious. Fish n Chips - delicious! (Same as Village Pub, but cheaper at Village Pub). Clams - good, fresh. French onion soup - super greezy. I think the bread they use is a piece of garlic bread. They also have the mandatory casino breakfast specials that seem like a good deal, I've never tried them.\n\nThis is an $8 steak. This is not a steak house. This is the kind of steak that benefits from being cooked a little more by getting just a bit more tender.. go medium-rare. For the price, you won't have any regrets. Unless you're a vegetarian (sissy)."

The karaoke* is almost all locals/ regulars, and most of them can really sing. The vibe is old -fashioned and laid back. A great place to start or end the night. \n\n*Recently, however, the secret got out to the undergrads at UNLV, and the gaggle of annoying sorority girls screaching \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" into the mic and giggling incessantly has put a damper on the vibe. The old MC used to regulate pretty strictly, but th elast time I was there, some new guy was running the show and letting the sorority girls ruin everything. Even though it is not as good as it once was, it is still worth it."

Unless I got the wrong deal, you have to get the member card and print out the $8.99 10oz top sirloin steak deal.\n\nThe whole meal is simple and basic. Vgetables are similar to the libbys canned type -  nothing special. The potato is super filling,and the steak/prime rib is what I expect for under $10. What makes this place so hot? The price for a hot meal. It's under $10 for a decent meal in Vegas. The most memorable thing was the beer and root beer that they brew on site. \n\nWould return simply for the beer and cheap dinner. Either come early or come late because it's not worth waiting an hour to be seated and another 30 minutes for the meal to come after ordering."

Believe me when I say it can be really hard now to find a good deal in Las Vegas anymore, at least on the strip.  You have to go off-strip (like here) to find anything decent anymore.\n\nIs it the best steak you ever had? No.  The meat was a bit tough and chewy, but it was cooked medium rare the way I asked for it and flavorful for all that.  Rounded out with a large baked potato and a good pile of string beans, it was plenty of food after a long day of traveling and hiking.  The thing that puts this special over the top and makes it a four star is the inclusion of a house-made beer or root beer.  My husband ordered the porter (a decent beer too!) and I ordered the root beer.  The root beer was definitely better than most anything you can buy in the store."

Yes - it's not Prime restaurant worthy steak, but it's not bad considering it's a decent cut of steak.\n\nThe dining room can get kinda full on the weekends - obviously a lot of people come stumbling in here after a hard night of partying....so keep that in mind when you come looking for a deal in the middle of the night."

We were headed there to celebrate my youngest son's 21st b-day (yes, it's on V-day!) with plans to head to Fremont that night and then the Strip and a show on Sat.  \n\nGetting to our rental at the Wyndham so late that we opted not to drive anymore that night (btw: pushy, rude staff at that place).  Not quite knowing where to head (too late for a big buffet for me), we got on yelp and decided to try Ellis Island which was just an easy walk up and over one block. \n\nEven though it was 9:00 pm, there was a 45 min wait for dinner.  Not a problem!  We went over to the bar to enjoy some of their tasty beer, cocktails and karaoke....some of which was VERY good!  \n\nWhen it was time to be seated, it actually took much too longer for our server to come by our table.  After not seeing anyone for 15 mins. we went looking for the hostess who sent him right over.  After that- and yes, I know that's not cool, everything went really well.  My sons and my boyfriend all had prime rib and thought it was good for that price.  I had the NY steak and shrimp.  I don't actually like shrimp but wanted that cut of steak.  My boyfriend ate the shrimp.  My steak was seasoned nicely and cooked well.  I like medium and it was probably a bit over-cooked but I, personally, prefer that to under.  Not really any complaints about the quality of the food.  You have to know when you see the prices  to not have super high expectations but they exceeded mine!  We were bummed that we were too full for desert!  4 meals, 4 beers at dinner and the bill was $59 and some change!  (not including our bar tab in the karaoke lounge).  \n\nIt was a very nice \"save\" to a night that was going downhill.  We were pleased to find it so close by and we were pleased with our meal."

They have karaoke in one bar room, a cafe in the other, and a middle bar that surrounded by their main games/tables.\n\nLocated just one cross street from the strip you can't beat the feel of older town vegas, with the prices and deals this place provides. There is also a Metro Pizza located inside the casino open during the day which a HUGE local favorite spot around Vegas.\n\nI've been sipping on a stout and eating loaded potato skins since I arrived and can definitely get used to this place...

Clientele seemed to be locals/regulars who knew each other and the DJ. Karaoke DJ was pretty damn uptight though. House rules are you can't cuss on the little stage they have - so no songs with profanity. Their song selection already seemed pretty weak so I figured they had already weeded out all the songs that had any bad words. Then some guy started singing Closer by Nine Inch Nails and I suppose the DJ was not familiar with the song because right when it got to the part that goes \"I want to f*ck you like an animal\" she stopped the music and would not continue until the singer promised to substitute the word \"truck\" in place of the offending word. It was ok for anyone in the audience to sing the correct lyrics but not the main singer on the stage. That put a damper on things for me - not like there were little kids in the audience as it was a 21 and over bar. Seriously WTF, chuck? Probably won't be back. Truck this place."

I loved that you could order it \"naked\" and add your own sauce at the table; many places bring you BBQ swimming in sauce (and often times not that good). I had the half rack and half chicken and I ate nearly ALL of it...my husband ended up with maybe two of my ribs is all! He loved the homemade root beer. The beans as some have mentioned are not that flavorful but they make an excellent dipping sauce for the garlic bread. Our friends are locals who have been coming here for years...the prices were great, we picked up the tab for supper and four adults ate BBQ for under $65! By far the least expensive dinner we paid for in Vegas and nearly all our other meals were just for the two of us! Be sure to sign up for the Player's Card upon entering to get the reduced price."

I must admit though, when we were first walked in I was extremely skeptical because it looked more like shady Vegas than on the strip Vegas.\n\nI've been there four times and each time I go, I always get the prime rib dinner. You can't go wrong with it and the cooks are fairly good about meat temps there. I'd definitely say get the soup b/c the salads are whatevers."

The normal breakfast menu was no longer being served and the only option was the Bacon and eggs. Being a Vegetarian I was offended by this and asked for a substitution, which was not allowed. I ordered it anyway with instruction that bacon not be brought out. The potatoes were terrible but the eggs were fine and the toast was over buttered. I had two beers while I was here. The first was the Amber Ale which was a true to style amber. The second beer I ordered was the IPA. Now the IPA, let me put it this way; I had to ask the waiter after a couple sips that he hadn't accidentally brought me the Light beer.  I then later also had the stout - while I played a hand of black jack - which was again a below average stout, no creativity: no wood aging or bourbon or dry hops nothing to make it stand out.  \n\nBut to get back to my wonderment of the 4 stars by my fellow yelpers; I fully understand the appreciation of this restaurant. The service was great, Alex was my server and he was extremely polite and attentive. The hostess was at the least bilingual and seemed to know some of the guests by name. Every guest that I could see in the restaurant was enjoying their meal and their company. \n\nWhen I started this review I had given this restaurant 1 stars but I bumped it up to 2 while I wrote this review.   I would tell all vegetarians or health conscious people to avoid this place, but if you want a good price on a steak and want to be welcomed with open arms than please come here. True beer lovers should also avoid this place given that there is good beer to be had in this town.  I am judging their beer by only three of the five brewed in house."

Given the rave reviews about this place, I was really excited to check it out, but I did keep my expectations realistic.\n\nThis place was really close to our timeshare and it was a 5 minute walk (in the Vegas cold cold night to get there). I was excited to see the $6.99 steak special.\n\nStepping in, this place had that dive seedy feel to it. Got our table at 4am and wanted to eat. So me and my 4 friends ordered (I got the steak special that was supposed to come with a beer), and it took 20 minutes for our salad and soup to get off. Seriously?? 20 minutes? How hard is it to ladle in some soup into a bowl, throw some salad onto a plate and bring it out? OK fine, so 20 minutes, we thought well hopefully our dinners will come out a little faster. Oh noooo, that was not the case. Another 30 minutes of staring down the waiter and asking him to follow up on our orders (and it wasn't even busy that night, he was waiting 4 tables) and the food finally arrived. We were famished so we all decided to dive into our food. Low and behold, the food was COLD!! Like cold cold! Rubber cold eggs. My medium steak was so overcooked, I thought I was chewing cardboard. We all had maybe 5 bites of our food and we just gave up. I really wanted to run into the kitchen to check on my suspicions of the chef being a one armed, drunk, retard.\n\nWorse thing (well personally). They charged me for my beer that was supposed to be included in the special. I mean, it was just $1.50, but if you advertise the free beer with the special, then you should honor it. I was too fed up to deal with this place to argue the case. In the end, I paid 10 bucks and I felt like if I would have flushed that 10 bucks down the toilet, it would have been more fulfilling. The bill came to be $35.60 bucks or so, and we left $36 and got the hell out. \n\nWe weren't the only ones that were complaining that night. Some people were sat at a table and no waiter came by for 20 minutes. They just left. The guys next to us were bitching about the same things we were. Another table straight up skipped out after a waiting.\n\nSo we weren't the ones frustrated with this place. That $6.99 thing must be the only thing they have to lure customers in, otherwise I don't know why anyone would ever come here, because I know I'm not coming back. Not even on a drunk hunger driving night in Vegas.\n\n1.5 stars, I'll give the .5 star to appease those who swear by this place.\n\nDUMP!!!!"

Vegas is a city of decadence and imagination. In such a place it is rare that one finds a location for cheap eats of huge portions that isn't McD's or ::insert chain::. In that respect this place was amazing. It was like stepping into stereotype land. I wouldn't have been surprised if fear and loathing had of be-bopped thru this place in a tweaking, Hawaiian shirt clad rumble. If they had it would have been remise to not stop and devour some cheap eats.\n\nIt takes awhile to get a seat here, especially on Thur-Sun, but once your in its all gravy, or bread? Well that's what they start you with, tons of bread! They have several specials where you can get a main item and a beer or drink. This is a ridiculous deal. The beer is gigantic and so is the food. A side of beef with potatoes and veggies. Classic. Nothing fancy just food that you would expect to get in an old vegas casino.\n\nDefinitely worth the time/money to be full before going out in Vegas. This is a new staple place for me in Vegas!"

We signed up for the players club and got to spin the wheel for free points (I got 2,500 =$2.50) l, prizes (sis got free beer) & a coupon for $9.99 steak.

My prime rib came with green beans and choice of a side, I got mashed potatoes and soup or salad. I gave my cream of broccoli soup to my sister and she said it was pretty good. I ordered a prime rib done medium and it came out medium well, it was still very soft and tasty though! Lots of fat, but a huge portion. I had half left over to take home. \n\nI'll have to agree with other reviews that the food & service here is very inconsistent. \n\nCome here on a weekend from 9am-2 pm to get a Bloody Mary right in front of the cafe. It's build your own for ($7). They put whatever you want in it, and they use titos vodka. Ours had a bacon strip, a pickle, olives, limes, a piece of chicken & waffles. It was VERY good."

The 'taters were crispy golden brown and tasty. The sourdough bread toast (drenched with buttah) hit the spot.  So seriously.. $4.99?\n\nI know there are tons of places on/off the strip for cheap steak, but this is by far one of the places I can agree for its mind-blowing value. You can also opt out the egg, for a \"steak dinner\" - $6.99.\n\nOh yes, this place is also a brewery, so our order of house Hef was $2.

He suggested Ellis Island Casino, which brews its own beer onsite. It sounded like a good idea. I remembered the name of the casino from my last trips to Vegas 4-5 years ago, but couldn't place it. And then he pulled into the lot and I said to myself  \"Oh, it's THIS place\"\n\nEllis Island Casino and Brewery is a small, divey casino off the strip with a Super 8 attached to it. Classy. My friend digs dive spots, and I don't have a problem with them ... but I was skeptical about the quality of their beer and tempered my expectations. Which was a good idea, because the beer was a disappointment.\n\nThey offer five house-made brews of standard varieties - Light, Amber Ale, Weiss, Stout, and IPA. I started with the IPA and noticed that it had absolutely NO flavor. How can an IPA have NO flavor? I thought maybe he poured the wrong beer, but I saw him pour from the IPA tap. Maybe the lines were mixed up with the light? This would have been acceptable for a light beer - it was crisp and not unpleasant tasting. Rather, it was just flavorless.   \n\nAfter chugging it down, I went for the stout. This was a better choice, but still just an average stout at best. It reminded me more of a porter than a stout, and similar to Yeungling's porter. Acceptable, but nothing to write home about. \n\nMy friend, like many Vegas locals, love this place. And I kinda dig the seedy, divey vibe as well. And he says their house-made root beer is outstanding (I have never tried it). But the beer was disappointing. If that was really their IPA, then they need a reality check on what a true IPA is supposed to be. \n\nIf you're looking for a microbrewery in a casino, Triple 7 downtown is the way to go, not Ellis Island."

My friend ordered the $12.99 prime rib dinner which includes soup/salad, choice of potatoes including baked and either a root beer or an Ellis Island beer (no substitution). The sirloin was ok once I drenched it with A1 steak sauce, but if you're here drunk or after a late night partying, you probably won't care. If you're looking for a dinner meal like I was, go for the prime rib dinner.

While everyone else had scrambled eggs and bacon, we had the $8 steak special with a glass of beer. Steak is good for its dirt-cheap price, but the green beans were pretty awesome - buttery and tasty.\n\nBeer takes the main stage here. This place has one of the best beers of microbrews anywhere. The amber ale I got was so nicely balanced. However, amble ale is hard to make, and sometimes they do taste over-roasted. The other killer beer is the light lager, which has such an intense smell and taste of sweet malt (for a \"light\" beer, no less). The hefe and dark beer are all really good (well, fresh hefe are usually good), but light lager and amber ale are always the first two I get.\n\nDuring subsequent visits, I've come to realize that their pizza is good and the bbq ribs meal is awesome (this is another semi-hidden secret). This place is a cult."

            "review": "$7.99 Off-Menu Steak Special: It's been written many times, but I have to repeat it again - this is a fantastic deal, and a truly quality meal. \n\nOne of the best developments in the past decade of Vegasdom has been the arrival of America's top chefs, but I love to balance my Vegas trips between the pricier offerings and dirt cheap, classic meals of yore. While pretty much unavailable at the large strip casinos, if you're willing to wade into local territory, you'll find that few deals are as good as the steak special at Ellis Island.  \n\nIt's a nice (not Morton's nice, you greedy assholes, diner nice) slab of steak, a couple ounces more than what you'd see at Sizzler, along with crunchy, garlic green beans, steak cut fries (or baked or mashed potato), and a choice of beer or root beer. I tasted the root beer, which is far superior to the corn syrup version you might be used to, and I had the dark stout, which wasn't as dark as I like it, but fuck. Eight fucking dollars for the whole thing? I'll take it. \n\n***We only waited ten minutes, getting there on the late side of dinner, mid-week. I don't know that I'd want to wait more than a half hour for this, or anything, really. Lastly, the waitress was covering way more tables than most would have to, but she was great, and I enjoyed veering into a conversation with her about the perils of the LA-to-Vegas weekend drive."

Just wanna note that the brews are just alrite, they have their characteristics but it's not outstanding (sam adams is better). not as much carbonation as i hoped and not frothy (stout).  do the counting and you get 6 things for 7 bucks."

While the $6 Steak and Eggs special is in Sam's Town, Ellis Island is actually minutes from the strip. Yes, even though it's @ $6.99 (instead of about just $6 total at Sam's Town), you get their Sirloin Steak special. \n\nIt includes a Sirloin steak cooked how you like it, baked, mashed or fried potatoes (fries), a side of veggies, soup or salad, AND if you choose, a tall stout of their home brewed sarsaparilla aka root beer or beer (alcohol)! Insane, right??\n\nI chose the soup (which was clam chowder) and I expected it to be pure sodium overload, surprise, it WASN'T. It was just right. I didn't need to season it, nor did I need to drink a gallon of water after eating my soup. It had the right amount of chunks, be it potato, or sweet savory clam, it was spot on.\n\nMy potato (baked), was really good again. It wasn't gourmet, but seriously, it's a baked potato, how wrong can you be making one?\n\nThe side of veggies, were green beans, which again, decent. \n\nThe steak, really good for the price I'm paying. I wasn't expecting filet mignon, but the cut wasn't tough and it was cooked just right. \n\nThe home brewed root beer was outstanding. If they bottled it here, I would buy a case and chug this on the drive back to L.A.\n\nSo, if you're in the hankering for a good, inexpensive steak dinner, and you're on the strip, make a slight detour and come here. You won't regret it and I know I haven't since coming here!"

The place is super small so get there early if you want good seats/table.  There are screens everywhere so you can always catch the words of the songs being \"performed.\" Went on  a Friday and the DJ seemed pretty blah, no excitement for performers like I am used to. But the performers added much excitement on their own! Seems like there were tons of regulars/locals so it had a nice friendly feel to it. \nThe biggest pro- this place is super cheap. Great drinks for low price and little munchies late night. \nThe biggest con... only con really: Smoke! It is so small and it seems like there is absolutely no ventilation. Most places in Vegas are smoking, but as long as no one is blowing directly in your face, you hardly ever notice. As a smoker, my eyes were burning after being there only about an hour.

            "review": "This review is focused on the Barbecue restaurant at Ellis Island, although I like the casino, too!  It's small, but comfortable - although a bit smoky.\n\nWe've been eating at the barbecue restaurant at Ellis Island for years.  Because of this, I've never had chance to eat at any of the other food opportunities there!  This visit was our first time since they moved the barbecue restaurant to the other side of the casino.  I guess I like that our large group can now sit inside - a bonus on particularly hot, cold or windy nights, but I did like the patio on beautiful nights!\n\nFirst, you need to know that it's still small!  Unless you get there just as they are opening, you're gonna wait to be seated.  Just plan for it.  Know it.  Deal with it.  It's okay. They're open 4-10.  Your wait will give you time to get a players club card so you can get your discount coupon.  You want that because the already low prices will be even lower with it.\n.  \nOnce you do get seated, you have an enormous menu to choose from.  You get either a half rack of ribs, a full rack of ribs, a half a chicken, or a half rack of ribs and half a chicken.  That's it.  That's the menu.  With each of those meals, you get beans, corn, cole slaw and bread. I think the most expensive one is maybe $12  (with the coupon).  The meat is delicious.  The price is right.  The service is good.  Oh, and it's a brewery, so you get REALLY GREAT beer for about $2.50.\n\nBest deal in Vegas.  Trust me."

            "review": "I was suuuuuuper hesitant about this place from the moment we walked in lol. \nBUT i read the reviews and saw that multiple people were happy with the food and the prices. \nWe got here at about 10pm went up to check in with the hostess and she said it would be about a 30 min wait.... IT WAS EMPTY! There were so much workers and lots of empty tables, so we clearly didn't understand what the wait was about. We then gave her the number to contact us (they text you when your table is ready). \n35 min after the time estimated we walk up to the hostess and ask her why we haven't been seated yet, and she mentioned she DID text us 3 min ago, where were we??? GIRL we were on the seats in front of you don't front! Anyway bad experience with that. I personally feel they make you wait that long just so that you can gamble in their casino, which isn't that great, but this cafe makes up for that. \n\nFOOD: Of course one of us had to get the prime rib, my husband decided to get the prime rib and boy oh boy it was deeeelicccious! Cooked to perfection! The salad was great also and so was the minestrone soup. We also enjoyed the green beans perfect flavor and nicely seasoned. I tried looking for reviews on the pork chop and there weren't any, so here's my review for that! The pork chips were tiny but for the price you can't complain, I got mine with a baked potato so that helped fill me up. My cousin got the fried chicken something omg sorry I don't remember but anyway she enjoyed. If you come here and you love prime rib, don't hesitate like us, GET IT cause for $14.99 my husband loved it and I did too by picking off his plate lol. \nI will be back and I will definitely get the prime rib!"

The food was right from the freezer into the fryer. I had some shrimp thing and a heavily salted French dip. It was cheap, but sat in my stomach for the rest of the day. \n3. They were running some scam where if you joined the players club and played a dollar you got free play or something. After jumping through a few hoops and completing the requirements I was told I wasn't eligible because I had signed up a few years previously. They couldn't tell me that before I completed the requirements for some reason. \n4. When I tried to get the rest of my $$ out of the machine it wouldn't work and I had to wait 20 minutes while they called maintenance to get it out. \n5. A waitress was complaining loudly about having been robbed by a patron earlier in the day. Made me feel great about being there."

            "review": "I came to Ellis Island with my wife today on the advice of a friend who recommended the prime rib here. As soon as we walked into the Caf\u00e9 we were greeted right away by a very friendly hostess and immediately sat at a booth. Our server came around promptly asking for drinks and any appetizers.  Once we had a few minutes to look over the menu, I put in an order for the King's Cut Prime Rib meal which included a choice of one the house brewed beers.  I chose the light beer to go with my meal. My wife  ordered the onion ring appetizer, and the shrimp scampi meal.  The wait time for our meal to arrive I would consider normal, as with the appetizers too.  Our server came around frequently for refills on my water and my wife's iced tea. \nOnce our meals arrived to our table, we immediately noticed that the shrimp scampi plate my wife ordered resembled soup. It had an overwhelming amount of oil left on the plate. The shrimp were large and butterfly cut, but were indeed overcooked as they were extremely rubbery. The overall taste of the scampi dish was on the bland side. Less oil, more garlic, salt, and herbs are expected.\nMy dish, the Kings Cut Prime Rib was a decent sized portion. Cooked to order (which was medium) and it was served hot. My meal included a baked potato and garlic green beans which were quite tasty. My only gripe was that the roasted outer portion of my prime rib needed much more salt and pepper to balance out the seasonings. \n\nThe house brewed light beer was excellent!!  It was not heavy at all as I drank this while eating my hearty meal. I need to also mention that the appetizer we ordered (onion rings) were very tasty.  It was a smooth flavorful batter that was not breaded. We really enjoyed munching on them!  \nOverall our experience was \"middle of the road\" (hence the 3 stars) as far as the execution of the food. The service was prompt, attentive, courteous, and friendly. The dining area was clean and well organized.  Parking was not any hassle as we found an open spot immediately. I would return again, but perhaps try something else on the menu...most definitely getting a few more pints of their brew!!"

I will write a few reviews and this is one.  I was at the Tuscany Hotel and Casino, about 2 Las Vegas blocks (I think a LV block is about  1/2 mile) off Las Vegas Blvd (Flamingo and Ballys corner) on Flamingo Ave.\n\nOK Ellis Island Casino is about 1 LV block from Tuscany Hotel and same from Flamingo.  I found this when I was asking where locals go.... It is an older place and is attached to a Days Inn I think.  It is relatively small place with a couple of BJ tables, slots, craps etc.   They have a big rectangular bar and they make their own craft beer (+1).  A beer is $2.50, which on the strip will be 5-10 each.  I love the amber beer.  Also when a football game is being televised, beer is only $1!! \n\nThey had a small club where Karaoke is on most nights I think.. .have been there and that was fun also.  Now what I really like is the restaurant for a good cheap meal.  They have a special that is a good size steak (thick like a filet but not the same quality but very good), potato, vegetable and a salad for $9.99.  Last year it was $8.99 and included a beer so that was a little disappointing.  To get the special you have to join the players club, which is no cost and like all players clubs at casinos you get points and sometimes free rooms.\n\nI had lunch there on Wednesday and decided to have the $5.99 breakfast.  It was unbelievable... I have never had a meal where I thought... this is too much bacon!!! .. the potatoes were awesome, more bacon than I needed and rye toast was great.   My friend had a burger that was very good and huge.  See the pics.\n \nI give them a 4+ for the food and beer at reasonable prices and the down home atmosphere.  If you are in LV and want to get off the beaten path for a great meal, stop here.  I will warn you that you will have to wait during dinner time."

Like the previous reviewer wrote, we too come for breakfast special and then pop over for the rib dinner! The BBQ is out of this world fabulous, succulent pork ribs in a delicious finger licking BBQ sauce (my mouth is watering just thinking about it) it comes with baked beans, cole slaw, corn on the cob, and garlic toast. There is also a Metro Pizza located in Ellis Island that has Sun and Thurs pizza specials (BOGO free), the pizza is tasty and is a terrific bargain! Seriously, folks don't let this place slip by ya' definitely a place well worth visiting!"

Plus since we came here as four students out budgets were quite low for dinners and lunch. \nI ordered the King's Cut Prime Ribs. It came with a salad and mashed potatoes + a free tall (and by talk I mean REALLY talk glass) of root beer/beer. However, the ribs were alright, borderline under the normal standard. The Mashed Potatoes though is SUPER SMASHING. I would totally pay $10 just to eat them. The texture is silky and the gravy is like... There is really no words I can describe it.\nMy friend ordered a Streak Sandwich, NY Strip and a Pasta and they all came out to \nabout $100 something for four so that's not bad.\nOne plus point about this place is that the service is excellent and there are plenty of seats. \nSo all in all, a great place to eat if you want to pass all the ridiculously expensive restaurants but also don't want to have to resort to the McDonald across the road"

The items that take the least amount of time to prepare were made too far in advanced and allowed to sit around thus we were served cold, hard bread and mushy, overcooked, bland corn on the cob.

Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I stopped by several years ago with my fam bam because Dad read that they had good pizza at Metro Pizza. My mom put one foot in the door and immediately turned around and said let's go.  We'll get back to this.\n\nI came again around 7am a few nights ago for some steak and eggs, recommended by the valet at Artisan Boutique Nightclub/Hotel, and by our cab driver.  This is apparently where every cab driver comes for their steak and eggs, $5.99.  The food was nothing to write home about, very standard.  Clientele was ALL cab drivers, divided into various ethnic groups, telling outrageous cab stories.  I did feel a little awkward, my friend and I being the only girls in there for awhile, and being stared down by the cab drivers.  The waitress was attentive, and she knew the cabbies like regulars.  We easily scored a cab home (this comment will make sense in a bit).  I would have rather gone to the Peppermill.\n\nThe next night we came back to sample the pizza (since my dad said it was good years ago) and check out the karaoke bar.  Metro Pizza is 2 for 1 large pizza's on Sundays. Good deal if you ask me.  There is however, no place to sit and eat your pizza.  You can sit in the adjacent booths only after 10pm, because they are really only for the BBQ place.  I thought the pizza was pretty good, but I would have rather had it delivered to my room.\n\nThe real irony came when we were unable to find a taxi after our pizza feast. Not a single one to be found. There were 20+ drivers there not 14hrs ago! We walked to the hotel next door, and they called a cab for us and some other folks.  One showed up about 25 minutes later, and he told us to walk to the 7-11, that there were 2 sitting there. Make sure you have a ride home, because this place is not on the regular taxi circuit.\n\nTo sum it up, I would not come back unless I had to, and I would have their pizza delivered to my lazy butt."

Keep in mind this is slightly off the strip and a dump, so do not by any means expect the flashiness of newer Vegas. \n\nThe $7.99 steak and beer dinner is a secret menu special, which I don't get why but whatever. I don't care much for beer and I had had enough alcohol the night before, so I got a little fancy and went for the $10 steak and shrimp special. My special came with steak, fried shrimp, mashed potatoes, green beans, and a salad. The salad sucked!!! The Italian dressing was really oily and the salad tasted not so fresh. \n\nMy steak and shrimp however were so good!!!! I asked for medium well, and I definitely got it. The mashed potatoes and gravy were also delicious and went great with the steak and shrimp. I tried the beer that came with my friend's steak specials, not so impressive, but then again I don't like beer, so don't listen to me lol. One of my friends steaks was not so great, he asked for well and I think got medium, which he was not nuts about. \n\nI just read there's $10 rib and chicken special!!! That's enough to bring me back!!!  Not gonna lie though, the service is kinda shitty, so I think overall Ellis Island gets 3.5 stars. I agree with all the other reviews that say you should come when you're shitfaced. You won't care as much about the bad service, and your food will probably taste way better."

You know a place is gonna be good when you hear this exchange between a waitress and the host: \"Take them to table 8.\" \"That table is wobbly.\" \"Well put a book under it!\" Awesome.\n\nAfter a very short wait we were seated. I didn't expect this place to be as busy as it was at 8:30 on a Sunday morning! Our waitress was very nice and efficient. I just had eggs with potatoes and toast, and for $3.99 its as good a simple breakfast as you could get anywhere else. My husband had their \"special\" which was steak and eggs for $5.99, plus their house beer for $2. I think its the cheap beer that he was in love with the most, never mind that it was 8:30 in the morning. My sister had the corned beef hash and eggs, and she gave it a good review. \n\nThe casino isn't much to talk about, but we were just here for the food anyway. The prices can't be beat and the quality is decent. We'll definitely be back."

            "review": "Wow. BEST KEPT SECRET OF LAS VEGAS!!! I don't know if this listing is only for the restaurant, but the casino actually has a small bbq place as well. They only serve BABY BACK RIBS and BBQ CHICKEN (w/ sides of course!).You can choose from a whole rack of ribs (11.99), a whole bbq chicken (6.99) or THE COMBO-- 1/2 rack and 1/2 chx (8.99). Both are delicious, but I have to say that the ribs are my favorite. the meat is so tender and juicy and the bbq sauce is to die for! They even give you an extra side already because they know that people always ask for more. If you sit outside on the patio, you can see them grill the meats right in front of you.\n\nThe humungo plate also comes with corn on the cob, bbq baked beans, and toasted bread. If you don't like one of the sides, you can ask the waiter to swap it out for another. I just went this weekend and the asian server actually gave me extra sides free of charge! Also, he gave my friend all the sides for free since she was the only vegetarian at the table. I've gone here a few times and other than the Asian male server, most of the wait staff are impatient and rude. You can't really blame them though since the restaurant is tiny, there aren't enough tables, the wait is almost always over an hour or two, and people are constantly asking when there table is ready. In any case, this place is DEFINITELY WORTH IT!! You can pass the wait time by gambling at their $5 blackjack single-deck tables.. you'll probably win enough to cover your dinner since it's so cheap! Oh, and if you like light and very crispy beer where you can actually taste the hops, then you must try out their house-made beer. It's only $2 bucks! \n\nI'm from Orange County, CA and I've made a trip out to Vegas JUST to eat at this bbq place (and to do the usual Vegas stuff of course). I'm not gonna lie, I pretty much signed on to yelp to write a review solely because I just took a bite of my leftovers right now. 3 days later and they are still melting in my mouth. MMM MMM MMMMM!!! :)\n\nTIP #1: If you go with a big group, have someone put down their name first because you will be waiting for over 2hrs. They will give you a number and they call them over the loud-speaker so you can hear it wherever you are in the casino. Just don't be too busy gambling!\n\nTIP #2: One order is definitely enough for one or even two (if you're with a bf/gf) to share, but I suggest ordering one for yourself and saving the leftovers for later. They taste EVEN BETTER at 4am after a night of clubbing and drunken fun!"

This place actually brews their own beer, so it is not your typical bud or coors for these prices. I love craft beer, so I am probably more critical having tried so many, but I am sure most people would really enjoy the beer here. The flavor and complexity of the beer is nice, but it did seem to be a bit watered down. Maybe to appeal to piss beer^ drinkers?

As the night wore on, it got more packed and by midnight we were sure we weren't going to get to sing again.  The ambiance and the crowd just makes singing so much fun!  They cheer you on and dance and sing along.  The sound system is great too.  They have TVs all over the bar with the lyrics displayed.  They also seem to have a good selection of music.\n\nWe went back on a Friday night and that place was PACKED to the hilt.  We put our names in and ended up having to wait about 1 1/2 hours to sing.

            "review": "I had been meaning to visit Ellis Island to jam a night away singing karaoke. Ellis Island seems to have a reputation for killer karaoke. But what is it that ultimately got me to take a trip to Ellis Island? A video from Vice's Youtube channel, Munchies. In the video, Ellis Island is explored as one of the (cheap) places to hang out at. So off we were to our $9.99 steak special to see if it was as good as the video made it out to be. Honestly, it wasn't. And it wasn't even $9.99!\n\nWhen we initially entered Ellis Island we were taken back by how big the establishment is. I was imagining it to be a medium to large dive bar... this place is (obviously, as I later discovered) a \"full size\" casino. There are table games and slots on slots on slots - after all, I am in Las Vegas. Karaoke was alive and well. In case you're wondering, karaoke is in a separate room to the left from the main entrance. The Munchie segment had mentioned signing up for their player's card and getting free slot play, so that's what we did. I was disappointed that I wasn't cool enough to get the porcelain chicken, but the free play was a nice score. Naturally, I won nada. The player's card sign up was pretty easy and didn't take too long even though there were two of us signing up.\n\nThere are a couple restaurants to choose from inside Ellis Island, most of them were closed when we arrived though. The caf\u00e9 was very much opened and exactly where we wanted to go to try their food. The prices are pretty cheap considering Ellis Island's proximity to The Strip. I was adamant about trying the steak special but my boyfriend got a French toast dish. The steak was pretty thin and a bit dry in places and chewy in others, overall it wasn't horrible... perhaps I just had my expectations raised after watching that show. My boyfriend's French toast was pretty darn good though! Ellis Island has their own brews so I tried the Amber Ale which also wasn't bad...especially for $2.\n\nOverall, Ellis Island is pretty fun escape from The Strip... and it's not ridiculously far away so I will encourage tourists seeking a \"different\" Vegas experience to visit. I still want to go back and fulfill my karaoke needs and will be sure to post an update to this review on that experience, but for now... BYE, BYE, BYE!"

It sometimes takes a while for them to decide who your server is and/or for them to come take your order.  \nThat said, I still come to Ellis to eat because the food's good and it can be very cheap.  You kinda have to know about the specials tho.  (don't think they're on the menu)  Basically, I get 1 of 2 things when I go.  Either the \"Dinner Special\" (soup or salad, nice sized thick cut steak, potato and green beans, and a beer which they brew there; all for $6.99)  It says on the place mats that they are one of the top 10 breweries in America.  I'm not a beer expert, but it is good and they have a variety of kinds to choose from.  They're cheap too at somewhere around $2.  They even make their own Root Beer, (which you can get with the dinner special instead of a beer) but beware that it's very, very sweet.  \nThe other thing I order is the steak and eggs for $4.99 (thin but decent steak, eggs made-to-order, hash-browns, and toast.)  Both are a great value.  The dinner more so therefore I usually get that.  I have eaten the steamed clams a couple times as well and they are delicious!  They also have a BBQ restaurant at which, I've been told, are the best ribs in Vegas.  Sadly I haven't eaten there yet but I look forward to checking it out.  :) \nBTW, to my fellow Casino Employees:  bring your badge and get 2 free drinks at the bar from 3am-8am."

They have great breakfast with a steak & eggs combination on the cheap. Also, they have a special for a beer, steak, and fries (or baked potato) that is very tasty for $8. You got that right $8. I know some places in DC where I can even buy a beer for $8. This is where the gambling gods have blessed you with cheap and tasty food all the time. They also have great Microbrews and pizza - this is a mans place.\n\nI will say that this place is a dump and they definitely could remodel it or possibly keep it cleaner.

You would see the restaurant and second guess if you were transported back into time.  Then you would order the $12 prime rib, that comes with salad and a premium beer.  You would take one bite and realize, this place is the most bang for your buck meal in Vegas!!  The salad is your standard house salad, choose your dressing.  It comes with a large premium beer, not just your standard Bud Light, but Amber Brock, Hefeweizen, etc...  the prime rib is absolutely delicious!!  Served with baked potato and green beans, all for only $12?!?!  Are they insane?  Or are you insane because you haven't eaten here yet?\n\nCome early, the wait can be very long.  But that's what the casino is for?  We had to wait an hour for our table.  No problem.  I'll be shooting craps... Came up $80, dinners on me guys!"

Now that I'm a permanent resident of this little desert oasis called Las Vegas I figured it was time to update just why Ellis Island is the best place to eat, drink, gamble, and sing karaoke in Vegas.  Here's the updated reasons in no particular order: Awesome (and I mean awesome) dealers.  The celebrity dealers are a welcome addition to an already skilled and friendly team of dealers.  They are there nightly and feature the talented & funny Barbara as Bette Midler, a suave Gary as Elvis, a curvaceous Dinora as Mariah Carey, Lynn with a heart of gold as Shania Twain, Karine as the blonde bombshell Marilyn Monroe (some nights she's Christina Aguilera but either way a hot blonde), and Kuki (probably spelled wrong) shaking it as Shakira.  If you like karaoke this is the place to come.  They have it nightly and it goes from 9pm to 3 or 4am depending on the night.  It gets crowded so get there early to find a seat.  Expect to wait at least 1-2 hours to sing.  It's that popular.  There's a wide variety of singers from awesome to just shoot me now but you'll have a blast regardless.  Ellis is right behind Bally's and a short walk from the Linq.  There's never a shortage of taxis in the parking lot either.  Do yourself a favor and check out Ellis Island!"

The staffs and the crowd were older people.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful.  \n\nThe menu was extensive.  A lot of choices like Pastas, Prime Rib, Chicken, Salads, etc.  The price was cheap too.  It was like $12.99 for Prime Rib..Great Deal!\n\nMy friend got the King Cut Prime Rib ($12.99).  It served with baked potato and beer or Root Beer.  I got the Grilled Chicken with Portobello Mushrooms ($8.99).  The mushrooms were cut in slices and served with spinach and rice pilaf.  \n\nBoth dishes also served with choice of soup or salad.  I think the soup was much better than the salad.  It was clam chowder for that day.  Very creamy, lot of clams and flavorful.  \n\nI did not try the Prime Rib but the sides were delicious and fresh.  The chicken was so juicy, tender and not dry.  The mushrooms were flavorful.  The portion was very generous too.\n\nWe also ordered the cheesecake ($4.5)  for dessert.  The cheesecake was huge and tasted good.

            "review": "This joint got great overall reviews here on Yelp as well as Trip Advisor. Now I concede- if you're paying $5.99 for breakfast, don't expect Gordon Ramsey fare.  I came here because after 4 days of paying obscene prices to eat a meal on the strip (e.g. $5 for A SLICE of pizza), my pocketbook needed a break. Moreover, after my class I wanted breakfast, and it was after 11 AM on a Saturday.  Now in New York you can get breakfast 24/7, no problem.  & GOOD breakfast at that.  On the Vegas strip you better get breakfast by 11 AM, and brunch fare is very limited.  I don't get this in a non-stop party city like Vegas that you can't get breakfast anytime of day any day of the week, but at least on the weekend. Smdh, but I digress.....\n\nSo my son found this joint that serves breakfast until 2 PM, & I really, really liked the prices.  It's a decent walk off the beaten path, and hence can feel a little unsafe.  But being from Brooklyn, it takes a bit more than that to scare me, but I digress.... Moreover, if you're from New York City you know: sometimes the greatest tasting food comes out of the biggest holes-in-the-wall; look at this Caridad restaurant by Woodhull Hospital in Bushwick, or Angie's Breakfast Spot also in Bushwick.  Anyway, I kept an open mind.\n\nYou have to pass through the small, dingy, smoke-filled casino to get to the dining area.  Mind you all public spaces in New York indoor areas, and even some outdoor spaces, are smoke-free & have been so for many years, so I am unaccustomed to eating around smoke.  As the dining area was not enclosed, the faint odors of tobacco is always present everywhere, including the dining area.\n\nWe had an expected 30 to 40 minute wait, and was seated about 45 minutes later.  My son ordered an egg white cheese omelet.  Problem #1:  egg WHITE.  I ordered safe: bacon & eggs.  Can't mess that one up. Our food came within a reasonable amount of time. What they gave my son was some round, pancake-shaped mass of (WHOLE) egg with 2 slices of what looked like Kraft cheese singles on top (!) (?).  So essentially he didn't get what he ordered, but I was not surprised that they would not understand how to separate out the yolk, and would not be the least bit surprised if they never ever had a customer request egg whites (only). & what the hell, a cheese omelet with the cheese on the OUTSIDE??  I cannot make this stuff up... Good thing he also ordered French toast, although I don't think that was anything to write home about either. \n\nNow my food was just that: scrambled eggs, uninspired but tasty enough albeit slightly greasy bacon, these weird potato things that taste ok/pretty good (probably microwaved from frozen), and toast that was heavily buttered and textured like styrofoam.  \n\nI get it: my breakfast was $5.99, and the whole bill with drinks and extra sides was $23 in total (I almost always tip 20%).  It wasn't like Wolf Gang Puck was back there slinging hash, but like I said before: in New York you can get some absolutely delicious food that is super cheap, so cheap you can feed your whole small family, and it's like you're stealing it-- you know what I'm saying\" like a whole steamy, juicy, tasty rotisserie chicken from the Dominican Spot with Arroz y gandules or frijoles and/or Maduros for like $10.  And you leave the table rubbing your belly like, \"Damn!\" Swearing you're not going to eat for a year because you ate long after you were full because the food was That Good.  And you don't have to go to Gordon Ramsey's Steak either.  \n\nAnyway, my point is that the dining experience was blah at best, more like peculiar, and just nauseating at worst.  It wasn't that the food tasted bad, but was not enjoyable. & although you do get what you pay for, that certainly does not hold true necessarily with the New York dining experience (& so I am a bit spoiled!).  Much better food can be found at IHOP, and even Denny's I'd bet, for a few extra dollars."

We requested their large party booth (which was empty) because my husband has back problems and needs a booth and when we were finally seated they seated us in these ridiculous wooden chairs. I asked to speak with the manager regarding the seating arrangement and she basically shrugged and said I don't know what to tell you. Needless to say we did NOT eat there and will never return. If I could give no stars I would."

I had a 2 for 1 coupon for the BBQ.  The requirement to use the coupon was to join their players club (which I did) and they gave me a food credit of $5.\n\nPlaced two orders for the 1/2 chicken and 1/2 rack of ribs combo ($8.99).   Their 1/2 rack is a full rack back home.  The serving was huge and I must admit that the food was very good.  Quality was surprising very decent.  After using the coupon and applying my food credit, I ended up paying around 6 bucks for two meals....what a deal.\n\nOf course, I proceeded to lose $100 at their blackjack table after this hearty meal....Damn you, Vegas!!!!\n\nThe dealers were very friendly and it felt like I was in Old Vegas.  I love it when I can have a conversation with the dealers while we play (I'd ask stupid questions like what is the biggest loser/winner you dealt with, weird situations while working, etc.).   \n\nIt was very slow the Monday night I was there (so no karaoke was happening).   I hope this place makes it through this tough time.  The casino is small (compared to the mega casinos located nearby) but I would definitely return.  I need to try their un-advertised $6.99 steak special next time.  Ellis Island Rules."

It's ~$7.99 and comes with 2 sides and a craft beer or root beer. They often give you a $5 match play to use in the casino after dining.The casino is small, but fun. It's not fancy. It's to the point and we like that. Cocktail service is good serving their craft brews in large glasses. Their craft beer and root beer is the best in town. You can walk to this place from the strip.

Salad was nasty should have opt-in for soup. Prime rib was Really really GOOD! Especially for the price!! It's definitely way better than prime rib they serve at the buffets in vegas. Nice, Juicy and Tender..\n\nNy steak and eggs special (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EAwh1OmG6t6p3nRaZOW_AA?select=ijDx9t3kG5Lw58dIQfC5cQ) - $5.99 (Only on Weekdays 11pm-11am and Weekends 11am-2pm) A decent sized juicy and tender steak.

Cheap eats, ridiculous Karaoke, and cheap beer i mean seriously people this is a must do for the budget minded person in Vegas. \nI personally have the steak special at least once a month for $6.99 for lunch since my office is close. Its not the greatest cut of meat in the world but its decent, i get the mashed potatoes because i like the gravy and then the obvious green beans that are quite tasty. I dont drink beer but hear that its quite tasty but the root beer seems to be on point when i have it with my meal. Aside from the steak special you can find graveyard breakfast specials as well and they even have a daily menu on the chalkboard at the entrance of the place. Dont expect to have a gourmet meal on this menu but its decent hardy food at VERY affordable prices and you will leave full. I look forward to trying the ribs that everybody is talking about. And if there is a guy on stage getting way into singing \"eye of the tiger\" during Karaoke, tips are appreciated... thank you."

Little did the s/o and I know that there's a little hidden gem of a dive where they allegedly serve up some good Prime Rib, so we just had to make a stop.\n\nWe had dinner at their Cafe this past Tuesday night and fast forwarding through the 30-minute wait, we figured that had a to be a good sign, for a little dive casino off the Strip.  We get seated and man, it felt like I was in a bad dream; sitting in a semi-dimly lit restaurant, with a little cigarette smoke lingering in the air and decor that matched that of Mike & Carol Brady's vacation home, if they ever had one.  Not to mention, the most horrible Karaoke singers I've ever heard.  It was quite entertaining, especially for the setting but there were times, it felt like we were on some hidden camera show.\n\nWithout hesitation, we both were going to order their King Cut Prime Rib dinner, which came with a salad, veggies and choice of Potato, as well as Root Beer or their house Beer.  When our server took our drink order, I ordered a Coke.  Apparently, when it came time to order, I wasn't able to sub my Coke for the Root Beer it came with, not sure why, my Coke was technically a penny cheaper.  But whatever, I took the Root Beer anyhow...and took the cost of my Coke from our server's tip.  Speaking of which, yeah, our server and the restaurant staff was so jaded.  Service with a smile goes a long way...and so will your tip, so turn that frown upside down, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nWe didn't have high expectations for the Prime Rib, being that was ultra cheap at $13 a pop.  When our food came out, I didn't care much for the presentation, as it was quite sloppy.  The au jus spilled onto the plate, the sour cream was served it's own individual packet that you had to rip open, the horseradish was in it's own indivdiual plastic cup.  But, when all was said and done, I took a bite into the Prime Rib; first bite was good, figured it was the outside because of the seasoning so I started going towards the middle.  Second, third, fourth and so on...I finished that slab of King Cut without hesitation.  I was so impressed, not that I finished it but, it was a delicious cut of Prime Rib that'd make the bigger, bling casinos on the Strip bow their head in shame.  Shoot, I bowed my head in shame for discrediting this spot!\n\nOverall, we'd totally come back to Ellis Island for their Prime Rib again!!!"

It was absolutely delicious and I've been a dedicated Ellis Island lover ever since. This casino is definitely a locals spot. Many of the smaller casinos are. The larger ones tend to attract the tourists, not to say that Ellis Island doesn't have its share of tourists, either, but most people visiting stay on the strip. Ellis Island is located just behind the strip; behind MGM Grand. Besides being known for their BBQ, they are also known for their beer, as they brew it on the grounds. They even make their own root beer. A long time ago, the BBQ restaurant was located right in front of the vats and if you ate outside, you used to be able to walk through there to the outside space they had set up in the parking lot. \n\nThe establishment is definitely small and there is no hotel attached, even after all these years, however there is a motel that shares the same parking lot. They have plenty of parking around the building and if that's full, they have a decent parking structure. Make sure to get their players club card because you get daily discounts on the food at the caf\u00e9 or BBQ, and I believe certain specials on the drinks. Staff is pretty friendly, so no issues there for me. It can get extremely smokey in there, but that's because it's really small in there."

The beer and root beer both stay fizzy until the last drop. \n\nThe place itself inside is sort of old and dingy looking, but that is part of the charm. I hear the restaurant is amazing. I prefer to eat at the Metro Pizza place inside, but the restaurant was packed full of people and I do believe there is a wait list for the ribs. \n\nThis is a great place to come if you are looking for an experience away from the busy strip."

This casino/brewery is kinda divey looking on the outside, and it is off-strip, so two strikes against it starting off, but it is totally worth the walk from the strip (behind Ballys).  Especially if you want great steak and egg or BBQ combos at a cheap price.  The cafe and bar both serve the Ellis Island Brewery beers even flights of all of their offerings and $2 craft beer pints.  The beers are pretty average, but I support the micro locals whenever I can.  I liked the Amber Ale the best follwed by the middle of the road IPA.\n\nThey have Karaoke going on in the casino bar if you are into that (some good some bad)."

It is good to eat a nice big meal before the whirlwind begins.\n\n It was crowded mid week due the all the cowboys in town for the rodeo. we had no wait for a table for the first time.\n\n\n  Sat right down and got an Amber Ale quickly. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken and my wife ordered the Cobb Salad, no chicken, no bacon, she is a vegetarian and this salad always makes her happy. I believe it came with garlic bread. Nice sourdough rolls were brought out also. I also ordered mash potatoes because they are old school cafeteria brown gravy delicious. The chicken comes on a platter with a ton of steak fries and really good cole slaw. I got a wing, a leg, a thigh and a breast.I could not eat it all. Which is crazy.  It is just really good fried chicken, that is all I can say. I have had a bunch of other stuff there and it has all been good. They are famous for the steaks for good reason, but if you like fried chicken and beer, you should try this place. \n\nIt is also a good place to gamble."

They wouldn't even let us add one chair to the table so we could all sit together. Even worse, we waited for about 10 minutes and we hadn't even been asked what we wanted to drink.\n\nFinally, a nice Polish waitress saw us and swiftly took our orders. When we told her about our table predicament, she said \"Really? Just go sit in that booth over there. I'll tell them I sent you there.\" She single-handedly saved this establishment from losing business that day, and for that we tipped her nicely and I even learned to say \"thank you\" in Polish just to show how grateful we were. I only wish I could've caught her name.\n\nNeedless to say, the steak and eggs plate was absolutely delicious, and you can't go wrong for $6.99.

It was 4:30 a.m. and we were all living off of 3 hours of sleep the night before + a good amount of drinks, \nbut that didn't stop any of us. \n\nThe steak special goes like this: you get a good sized steak, potatoes, green beans, soup or salad, and a beer for $8. AWESOME deal, but if only the quality was as good as the price. Can't have the bet of both worlds right?\n\nI had a soup, which was Cream of Mushroom at the time. A bit watered down and lacked salt, but not too bad. The steak is where they just went downhill, but I really wasn't expecting anything better from such a place. It lacked any marination, was all burnt on the outside, and was just overall bland and charred. The mashed potatoes were great, though.\n\nAlso, they may claim to be the best brewery in Vegas, but I highly dispute that. Their dark beer was heavily watered down, was way too bitter for such a beer, and just didn't go with the meal at all.\n\nIn conclusion, get their mashed potatoes. Everything else sucks."

Cheap, delicious food, karakoe, and a super friendly staff all make for a great experience.  We were fortunate enough to meet Mike who was running the event we attended, and he was a total boss.  We were totally taken care of, and even obliged in our ridiculous scavenger hunt requests.  \n\nI know that Vegas is known for good customer service, but I guess I just did not expect to be so warmly welcomed throughout my stay.

We didn't want to go to a huge casino and deal with all that or get dressed up, or have to travel to far. Well we checked yelp, and Ellis island seemed to be worth a shot, since it was only about 1 mile from our resort/condo. We arrive and was skeptical before going inside. Looked questionable. However once we went inside and settled at bar. Things seemed to be OK. Casino is a little run down, but prices are cheap for food and drinks and food is pretty good. I had 3/ 22oz house  Belgian white drafts with an orange slice, several shots of lemon drops, a huge Quesadilla, and my wife had about 3 or 4 mixed drinks. We were ready to go and turned to each other to guess what our bill would be. I guessed $100 she said $80. Our bill came and it was only $48. We thought something was missing, as it is Vegas which=expensive usually. We left a $13 tip and left. This is a local no frills Casino/bar/karaoke/diner/pizza place that brews some of its own beer. Good place to go to for a cheap night out, or before you hit the strip at night and spend more money. Check it out give it a chance."

I was there a few months ago on a whim, and was very happy when I finally got out of there.\n\nAfter a conference a large group of us went there for some karaoke fun.   We had no knowledge of the place, and in typical Vegas style got a Hummer Stretch Limo to carry all of us to the destination.  Upon arrival we quickly realized the limo was very much over-the-top.  \n\nWhen you walk in the smell of mold, bad beer, and cigarette smoke is enough to knock you over.  Directly in the front doors lies the casino, and to the left is the karaoke bar.  The group of us headed into the bar, and were instantly ostracized by the local crowd.  It was 9:30 on a Wednesday evening and the place was packed to the rafters.  We managed to find a corner to hold up, even though we called ahead for reservations.  When I attempted to sit at a table, I was immediately shouted at by an older man sitting alone at the table meant for four.  I was advised, \"That was his table, no one sits at his table.\"  \n\n\"Allrighty then...\" I thought.  \"This is going to be an interesting night.\"\n\nWe ordered a selection of the house beers, and began making our way to start booking singing spots.  The first spot was 54 people behind in line.  \n\n\"Allrighty then...\"\n\nThere was hope, if you signed up for the Ellis Island membership and played $50 of casino games you could jump the line.  We decided to wait it out.\n\nAfter 15 minutes our first round of beers arrived.  Mine had a shard of glass in it.  I can't make this up.  Another 15 minutes a new Amber arrived.  My first sip: it was stale, warm, and overall terrible.  I tried to push through, but couldn't. I tried the lager with similar results (minus the glass the 2nd time around) and then switched to bottles of Budweiser, as at least I knew what I was getting into.\n\n30 minutes in and my head was swimming from the cigarette smell, and I'm a smoker.  There was little to no ventilation present, and we had to go outside periodically to catch some oxygen.\n\nOn the positive side, the locals (other than the crazy table guy) were all very nice.  It was rapidly apparent this wasn't your ordinary karaoke bar.  The regulars at Ellis Island take things VERY SERIOUSLY. Especially the guy in a 4 piece white suit, singing \"This is why I'm hot\" with the most compassion I have ever seen from a human being.  When we eventually got up for a round of singing they would all clap, cheer and give us props as we headed back to our corner.  If it wasn't for them, the entire night would have been a nightmare.  \n\nWe didn't stay for a second round of songs, we had to get out of there; back to the strip full of oxygen and cleanliness. \n\nIf you are going to Vegas, to experience the lights and the hedonism stay far, far away from this place."

Nothing fancy about this place but we love dive bars. \n\nWe signed up for their FREE rewards card and received a steak dinner (with beer) for 8.99. It was tasty. \n\nBeers are around $2.25 for a huge glass and playing penny slots I won around $10 which isn't bad considering you also can drink. Make sure to tip though! \n\nSmaller area so the place does get smoky - we typically went during the day and it was better. \n\nWould definitely go back for beer and the slots!"

For 2008, I would like to nominate them for \"Best Bang For Your Buck Restaurant.\" Does that category exist? No? Too bad, I'm making it happen.\n\nAn Enterprise Rent-A-Car employee at the nearby Westin Casuarina Hotel suggested that we go to Ellis Island when we asked her for a place to eat. It was just half a block down. Upon entering, I was enveloped with cigarette smoke. I hate the smell of cigarettes and all of its carcinogenic qualities. That was a very bad first impression. However, that was the only bad impression that this place left on me.\n\nWe went to their restaurant area and I almost couldn't believe my eyes when our waiter handed us the menus. Everything on the menu was incredibly cheap! I had never seen so many items on a menu that were below $10 before! But then my instincts kicked in and wondered if the price fit the quality of the food. \"You get what you pay for\" has always been my philosophy with anything you can buy. I was hoping they would give me the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIt was mid-morning so I decided to order their Ellis Island Classic Omelet with ham. I got it with bacon and it also came with toast and potato...potato...errrr...\"silver dollar potatoes.\" That's the best way I can describe them. What can I say...they shut me up. The breakfast was surprisingly tasty and fulfilling! The omelet wasn't overcooked and was filled with chopped ham. It was the best $5.99 I've spent, that's for sure! Oh, and how could I have almost forgotten about their orange juice.\n\n\"What? WTF is so awesome about orange juice?\"\n\nBaby, this orange juice was the shiiiiiiiit!!! It's totally fresh squeezed, homey!! But if it wasn't really fresh squeezed, I'd like to thank Tropicana for making some damn good OJ!! Get the large OJ, you won't regret it.\n\nCome here if you're on a budget and want good food. The next time I'm in Vegas, I gotta come here again and try out their steak and eggs that almost every Yelper has praised here."

You even get a beer with your meal. \n\nThe best part is that you'll have a lot money left over for that expensive buffet you might want to splurge for. \n\nSo here's the downers. Everyone knows about this place so the line is pretty much in effect at all times. That's bad enough but then look around and you'll notice the caliber of people that are waiting with you is not exactly Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.  Then add onto the fact that the place smells pretty bad. The smoke smell is much more noticeable here than in just about any other casino in the area. \n\nAll in all I'd definitely check it out. If for nothing else you get good food at a reasonable price which definitely won't be happening the rest of your trip in Vegas."

I'm happy to say that it did. \n\nThe place looks like it hasn't been redecorated in a good 30 or more years. Cement floors, red vinyl seats, lots of wood paneling, cheap drinks - and the $6.99 special! The special is not on the menu, so you have to ask for it. Practically everyone who was dining there was eating it. They start you off with a basic green salad which is iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. Then they serve your steak with a choice of potato (I had mashed) and their vegetable. I was a little disappointed by the steak. I ordered mine medium rare and instead it was more like medium well-done. But for the price, I can't complain. The special also includes a beer since Ellis Island is also a microbrewery. You have your choice of lager, amber, or stout. The mashed potatoes were decent and the vegetables also. Definitely good cheap Vegas eats! I'm a fan and I would return here."

Don't geddit twisted, it's not the Meaa Grille but it got down Charlie Brown! \n\nI started with the chicken. The meat was smokey, moist, tender, succulent, full of flavor, not just from the Q but the actual bird was tasty... Scratch \"moist\", let's use \"juicey\" here. Left the breast to simmer as I hear the half rack of babybacks a callin... Here Mikey, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey!!! The rib meat came off the bone easily, but not over done. They had the perfect texture and M E A T Y!!! Wooo hooo, they were thick! The sauce was tangy with a molasses/vinegar twang. Kept dippin' into the side sauce provided.  Good grub!\n\nThe beans weren't of the sweet variety but more savory. I like em.\n\nThe Cole slaw was cold, crispy, and tangy without the overwhleming slipperiness brought on by excessive mayo...

It's small, dark, worn down, and not-so-easy on the eyes. But I like coming down here to get away from the strip every once in a while.\n\nIts a local spot. I think their biggest draw is their restaurant, which always has great deals for steak (it's something like 7 bucks) and you get a salad and some other things with it. Everything is very cheap here. \n\nIf you have never been and decide on coming, don't have any expectations. Don't expect great service, valet, or pretty cocktail waitresses. Come here because you want a cheap meal and to take an escape from fantasy and step into reality, for only a minute."

I have always wanted to come here but I never had the chance since I used all my possible tickets in Vegas elsewhere like Bacchanal Buffet, Oyster Bar and Tacos El Gordo. I promise, it was not because I didnt want to.\n\nThis small cafe I should say, is located on Koval Lane which is like the second next major street that is parallel to Las Vegas Blvd. I didnt know the cafe was located inside the casino so I walked into the lobby first and the housekeeper lady kindly told me its located in the next builiding inside the casino.\n\nI walked in and found the cafe right away. It was a lot bigger than I expected. To check if I was in the right place, I asked for the menu and looked. After confirming I came to the right place, we got seated and our server took our drink orders really quick. \n\nGot King Cut Prime Rib which also comes with the salad and 20 oz beer with $2.25 charge & NY Steak and Fried Shrimp also with the beer with $2.25.\n\nMy prime rib was pretty huge. I was like 'whoa, seriously this big for only $13.99?' To be honest, it was a thicker and a bigger cut than the cut from my most recent visit to the Lawry's which I was very disappointed in. Anyway, my prime rib which I wanted in medium was close to medium rare but it was good nonetheless. Very juicy and tender and I enjoyed it very much.\n\nNY Steak was pretty good too for its price, $11.99. It was cooked to perfection. Very tender. Really liked the fried shrimp as well. Super crispy and crunchy. There were only 5 pieces but it was good.\n\nMy beer, Hefe Weiss and Light, was both pretty good for its cheap cost. I personally liked Hefe Weiss a little more. I really liked how they tasted so light because I prefer light beers over dark/IPAs.\n\nMy lunch was so fulfilling for very low cost. I will definitely come back next time. My server was super nice and she was pretty funny too. I highly recommend! This place isnt 'You get what you paid for'. It almost feels like I owe them so much more money than I paid. Come by and try!"

For some reason I think we just didn't know what to expect and it looks like a little cafe or something. So we put our names in for a twenty min wait. It was actually pretty packed. Waited at the bar and laughed at the old people karaoke-ing. So now for the food. They have French onion soup!! Also got a steak, which was good too. The prices were amazingly cheap and the food was pretty damn good. And hey, in my book any place that has French onion soup is a winner. The service was laid back and quick.

I'd have to say Ellis Island's Steak and Eggs are great.\n\nLet's talk about the restaurant itself; it's located about one block away from the Strip, so it's relatively close to all the big hotels. If you're out on the Strip late at night, maybe just got done with clubbing or meeting some friends and want to get some grub at a decent price, this would be my first choice. Yep, and I said grub :) So don't expect any fine-dining steakhouse quality, but it's a great fixer at 2am in the morning when you don't want to settle with pizza or McDonalds.\n\nIn fact, I'd give the food more credit than just that. It's a lively little place to chat and enjoy a good dish while at it. The Steak and eggs portion are really great for the price. It's definitely filling and the steak is juicy and well-cooked. The service is what you expect at a casino; fast and friendly. \n\nMy only complaint would be that Ellis Island is really showing its age. I don't know how old the building is but everything, including the casino, interior, and restaurant just seems a little aged. But of course, that can be charming as well, just depends how you look at it.\n\nSo where am I gonna go after I see Deadmau5 or Redfoo at Marquee at 2am in the morning? This place of course! Also, now that I think about it, it's probably even walking distance from Marquee (Although being a pedestrian at 2 in the morning on the Las Vegas Strip is probably not a good idea)."

Also comes with a 20oz draft beer for $13.99.\n\nSteak and eggs (4/5) - The steak was a tad bit overcooked and chewy but I wasn't expecting it to be the best cut for $5.99. It tasted like it was char grilled and was very tasty. Comes with eggs, potatoes, and toast. I did really like the fact that the cubed potatoes were deep fried and crispy!\n\nTIPS:\n\n1)  If you join the player's club they give you a coupon for an $8.99 steak special but this is only good at dinner time. So if you go during lunch time, don't bother getting the card and just go for the steak and eggs.\n\n2) If you come at prime time, they give you a pager that will alert you when your table is ready.

Though this loud (and picky) table behind us was driving me nuts and probably making the waitress' job crazy. The place was cramped, with tables crowded against each other.\n\nOrdered the $7.99 filet steak deal. The meal came with the choice of beer or root beer. When asked if we could substitute the drink, she said no (not without a fee at least). Really? *sigh* Aside from that, great value (also came with side salad and 2 sides). I ordered a Texas burger ($8.99), which only came with one side and no drink, so my meal ended up costing more than the steak meal. It's a large-portioned chili cheeseburger, and was decent enough. Should have got the steak...\n\nA good bang for your buck, foodwise. I was expecting more out of this place though as far as ambiance and service.

My money actually did last longer here than\nat other casinos... luck?..maybe.   Small 'homey' casino.   Fun\nplace.  Older.  Not modern and glitzy.   \n\nGood food here...that is a BIG draw for them.   $6.99 for a 10 oz.\nfilet mignon dinner????   I had TWO...yes, at once!   $14 bucks for\n20 oz's. of Filet mignon?   Wish I lived next door to this place!  This\nis an 'unadvertised' special.   You have to ASK for it....not on the\nmenu.   They also have some great prime rib for $12.99.  \n\nThey are renown for their home-brewed beers.   Since I am not a\nbeer drinker, I can't vouch for that but I know they have received MANY\nawards.  \n\nThey also have awesome bbq.  We tried it one night... got there just\nbefore they closed and was told they only had enough for FOUR\ndinners..and we had SIX people!   Would you believe there were\nleft-overs after we were finished eating??   And we even had a few\nbig eaters!   Should tell you something about quantity.   Quality\nwas good too.  Ribs and chicken.   The chicken was my favorite....\n\nThey also have a \"Metro Pizza\" inside the casino.  I had never heard\nof Metro before, but evidently a LOT of other people had because around\nmeal times there was a longgggg line waiting to order pizza or buy a couple\nof slices.   I didn't get to try the pizza but it must be GOOD!!\n\nFun casino just a longgg block off of the strip behind Planet Hollywood.\nThe casino is hooked up with Super 8 motel next door....\n\nFun place with good food... how can you lose??"

While hailing a taxi cab, our attendant convinced us to go to this place (instead of another we had in mind).  Big Joe told us it was the best place to get some steak and eggs.  Well Big Joe, you were wrong.\n\nGranted, the food was decent.  The eggs weren't dry, and with a little salt and pepper, it made it just right.  Potato pieces always a plus.  I ordered my steak medium rare, which usually let's my meat be just the right texture - not too dry, and not too bloody.  Well, my meat was a bit on the dry side, so one can only imagine if I had even fathomed to order my meat well done.\n\nThen again, you get what you pay for.\n\nMy main complaint about this place was the service we received.  After a long wait to get our food (maybe I'm too used to the fast service I get in California?), we finished our food, and waited for the check.  I guess I'm used to getting the check before I'm done eating.  But we waited.  And waited....................... AND WAITED.\n\nWe tried asking the hostess for the check, but she just rudely stated she didn't know who our server was, and she simply couldn't help us.  From what I could see, there were only two servers at the time, so how hard was it to figure it out.  If the first one said no, THEN ASK THE OTHER!  And yes, we did try to get our waiter's attention.  Luck had it that he was serving two large groups.\n\nHowever, that is not an excuse for a good 30 minute long wait (or at least what felt like 30 minutes) for our check.\n\nReady to go to sleep, exhausted from a night of clubbing and suffering from a food coma,  we decided to do the right thing and leave money on the table before we left.  Yes, that's right, we never got our check.  At least we had the decency to leave money for our meal.  I know we could've just walked out and left, but we took the high road.\n\nWell, except for leaving this one star review that is."

He read on the internet that this place claimed to be one of the best out here on in the west.\n\nOn to the food.  If you are looking for real BBQ, look else where.  If you are looking for tasty food at a low price, this place may be for you.  Their menu consists of three items: full rack of ribs, half rack of ribs, and half bbq chicken half rack of ribs.  All entrees come with corn on the cobb, cole slaw, baked beans, and toast with butter.\n\nI got the half bbq chicken half rack of ribs.  I should mention the ribs are baby back ribs.  The cost was $8.99.  \n\nThe bbq chicken was moist, the sauce was good.  The ribs were really moist and the sauce was good.  \n\nHere's the deal, there is no smoke flavor, none at all that I could have distinguished either on the chicken or ribs.  There was no smoke ring on the meat of the ribs.  The ribs were missing that slight tug when the meat comes off the bone of a rib that was cooked slow and low on a bbq.  Did the meat fall off the bone?  Yes it did, but more like how the meat falls off the bone when you boil the ribs so they're tender or how meat falls off the bone when you braise something or similar to it.  And yes, I really do think they boil the ribs first as there was no real pork flavor.\n\nThe chicken was akin to tender broasted chicken from say Costco or Boston Market, except is had BBQ sauce on it.  Was it good? Yes, but it wasn't legit BBQ chicken.\n\nThe sides were less than stellar.  The corn on the cobb was limp.  All the kernels were not plump.  The majority of the juiciness was probably from the pot of water they used to boil the corn.  The cole slaw was fine, it would have been better if it had more of the dressing mixed in, but it was fresh and crunchy still.  The baked beans were on the verge of being flavorful.  The slices of bread they gave me were rye, they tried toasting it, but they still couldn't save it from being stale bread it was.\n\nDidn't try the beer so I can't comment on the legitimacy of their brewery.\n\nI like sauce and their BBQ sauce managed to make the food tasty, at least in my opinion it did.  It could have used more sauce though...\n\nTwo stars for being fake BBQ."

The ribs fall off the bone and the BBQ sauce is delicious.  Almost always stop in here for a meal when I'm in Vegas.  Service is friendly, but be warned this place gets crowded on the weekend.  You won't leave hungry."

The only thing I really don't like is the small dining area which causes a long waiting time to be seated. This is one of those few places I would gladly wait for however.\n\nThe casino itself is pretty drab and doesn't compare at all to anything on the strip, but that's not why I go there."

Apparently, they don't advertise this deal anymore, you have to ask the server about it.  I think the food might be better when there's less people, probably less rushed with the food orders.\n\nFor $5, the steak and egg combo really hit the spot.  The char on the steak was divine and the potatoes were nice and crisp.  For $4 you can get biscuits and gravy with eggs and a choice of sausage or bacon.  I thought their country gravy was pretty tasty last time I had it.\n\nThis is definitely the place to go for a late night snack to sober up.  Don't expect miracles to happen for $5 but do enjoy the cheap prices and rootbeer =d"

So you may have a little bit of a wait... But deals like those found at Ellis Island are worth a little patience. \n\n$1.75 for a beer brewed on-site... The only thing that may beat that bargain is the $7.99 steak dinner special that includes a beer. Yes, prices were cheaper a year or two back... They are still really low for a city will of places that charges $6 for a bottle of water and $18 for a Red Bull with vodka. Anywhere you can get 22 ounces of craft beer for $2 or less is a deal! For those of you looking to stay sober, they also brew a very tasty root beer.\n\nI went with my husband and his brother to Ellis Island for some cheap beer, dinner and gambling. It was a Tuesday night, we had about a 30 minute wait for a table in the restaurant so we sat down to play some video poker. My brother-in-law paid $2 to enter a slot tournament (they have them daily), ended up winning it and walked out with $114 and a story to tell his friends back home! \n\nThe three of us had dinner and beers for $30, not a bad deal at all. The steak dinner special is what I had, they steak isn't anything you'd get at a fancy steakhouse but it's still good for the price, which also includes a potato and veggie side. \n\nIf you are uppity and like to waste money, this place isn't for you. If you want to experience the charm of old Vegas without heading downtown, check out Ellis Island."

They haven't updated their air filtration system so it smells like what Vegas would smell like if they didn't pump perfumed air into the casinos. But aside from the old decor, and the smell of cigarettes and shame, I love this place and highly recommend it."

The place isn't big at all, maybe seating for 25-30 altogether, but still they had this place understaffed. Seemed to me there was maybe one host/server that knew what was going on out of the 3 I saw. \n\nI think we had gotten there at 8:30 or so, thinking we'd have plenty of time before last call at 10pm, but despite getting a ticket and hearing there were only 5 parties ahead of us, we didn't get seated until about 9:55pm. Seating seemed to be haphazard, since there was no mention to us that we had the option of getting seated outside in the patio, which probably would've gotten us seated earlier. \n\nI had heard that the BBQ was some of the best and cheapest in Vegas as declared by the locals so I was eager to try it out. I think we all ordered the ribs and chicken combo plate. For $12 it is a lot of food. It's not great by any stretch but it was satisfying. Despite sitting down starving (hadn't had much of anything to eat since 11am) I still couldn't finish off the plate which still had 2 ribs and the chicken breast still leftover. The ribs were okay, not particularly tender, but I did like their BBQ sauce which was served on the side and the chicken was surprisingly juicy. \n\nI didn't get to try the beer which they brew themselves, but I hear it's pretty good and was voted one of the best places to get a cheap beer in Vegas by the local radio station (heard it on the radio the day after I was there)."

We came here for the $5 steak and eggs special, but they estimated a 20-25 minute wait.  So to the tables I went.  Standard blakjack, dealer didn't speak much English though.  After losing my buddy's $20 on the first hand (BS... two jacks and dealer shows blackjack :( ) I made $15 for myself (after going down about $30ish).  So after 15 minutes of cards and going through the deck, I went to wait with my group.  After 25 minutes we asked how much longer and they said they had a table of 11 to seat before us.  10 minutes later, they let us in.  Eh.\n\nAfter being seated, we had a horrible server to start us off.  He walked up to the table and stared at us.  My brother was confused so he asked if the guy was there to take our order.  He answered yes.  So we placed our order and thought that was over.  He then took out jam away, we figured he was refilling it.  Nope.  After waiting another 20ish minutes we got our food.\n\nThe food was actually good.  I think it's my favorite $5 steak and eggs place in Vegas so far.  The sirloin was actually OK and the eggs were done right.  The potatoes it came with was the big difference.  It was cubed up and fried like fries.  But it was seasoned really well.\n\nI'd come back here again, maybe.  The service was kinda ridiculous though.  I'd give this a 4 or maybe even a 5 if I had a better experience."

            "review": "The two things I have experienced at Ellis Island are pretty incongruous: salad and cheap beer. It may seem impossible that a place that serves up cheap, house-brewed beer can also serve up a quality salad, but Ellis Island does just that.\n\nYes, Ellis Island is known for loose slots, BBQ, karaoke and interesting characters, but I can't comment on all of those. I have cleaned my plate of their apple-pecan salad however, and it is good. It has real mixed greens which is notable because lately I have been going to restaurants that say mixed greens or garden greens on the menu and serve iceberg. This makes me angry. Here, they throw in apples, cranberries, candied pecans and a tangerine dressing. Clearly, you have a delicious green creation. It might not be hard, but plenty of places get it wrong. Plus, you get to enjoy it in a very vintage atmosphere. People don't mention it as much, but the restaurant has the heavy upholstered, red booths that make you feel like you could be dining in the 70s. I would say it is a pretty classic Vegas atmosphere, but not fancy for sure. It is old school in its own way.\n\nAs for the beer, 20 ounces for $1.75 and it is microbrewed right there. How can you complain? The El Wheat (their hef) is refreshing and an easy drink. They also brew their own root beer. \n\nI need to head back to try the BBQ when I am up for a meat fest, but for now, I consider it a Vegas institution, and given the unexpected salad find, I consider myself a fan."

Example after I ate there walking out , a shirtless guy was being arrested. Same trip almost forgot that the paramedics were their inside haling some guy out . If you want cheap steak off the strip, and you love the film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , check this place out you will feel like a scene  form the movie .

It's mostly a locals place, but visitors like us were readily welcomed by the staff and patrons.  Everyone was friendly, and we went about four or five times.  \n\nFirst night was Karaoke.  It was Saturday night and it was clear there's a very loyal clientele that lives for it.  People were dancing to the songs, even when the singer was terrible.  One guy was so bad that someone who sang pretty well earlier finally got up and sang the rest of the song as a duet with him!  \n\nFull-pay video poker at the quarter level, so we played for a few hours and only lost a little.  Had breakfast there the next morning and it was as good and cheap as others have said.  Sunday night we went back for the steak dinner.  The wait was about an hour, so we gambled and had a few beers (free while gambling).  The dinner was excellent for the price - steak was tender and cooked to order.  We gambled there a couple of more times and overall didn't lose much.  We aren't smokers and didn't find it to be as smokey as some have said. \n\nIt's only about a five-minute walk from the sports book exit of Bally's and not a bad area at all.  Some have said it's sketchy, but I'd say that's only if you're comparing it to suburbia.  By urban standards it's a just fine.  It's just south of Flamingo on Koval past a gas station and 7-11.  Sure, it's not fancy, but it's definitely real!  If you like it you may also like Terrible's further east on Flamingo (maybe a mile from Bally's).  It's our previous (now second) favorite \"dive.\""

I am a pretty easy going and easy to please guy. Working with the public for more than 25 years and in casinos here in Las Vegas for more than 15 years, I like to believe I am very understanding as well. \n\nBut after what I got here at Ellis Island today, I refuse to spend another red cent here ever again. What is more frustrating is that I have been a semi-regular patron of EI for over 10 years now. I have always sung its praises as a great hole-in-the-wall place to friends and when family would visit I would have them enjoy that tasty BBQ.\n\nNo more.\n\nI came here today for the low key atmosphere. Played some slots(no luck there) and placed some sports bets(we'll see ;)....I than saw a few days ago that they had released some brand new $1 chips. I went to the cashier to buy 3 of them and was met with such a rude and snappy reply it really took me a second to process it. I'm sorry, are they made of gold?? What's with the attitude??\n\nNow I understand many casinos do not want to \"sell\" casino chips, because they are made for table play. I get that. I understand that. Ever since I moved here in the late 90's I like to buy 2 or 3 chips from each casino as part of my personal collection. I am NOT a chip dealer. I do not sell them. It is simply something for my modest little collection. I could understand if I wanted to buy 20, 30, or 50...or whatever....but 3??? Really?? All that attitude and the short, curt responses were hardly necessary. \n\nIn 15 years of doing this I have NEVER had a cage cashier treat me like the way she did today. This was an older lady working the cage around 11:30 this morning. Completely unnecessary and totally uncalled for.\n\nI'm most annoyed I didn't hit the cage first because I  spent money in the machines and made some sports bets first. Had I experienced this first, I would have left immediately.\n\nI can tell you one thing though. My 11 year love affair with Ellis Island is over. I will not be back and I will no longer bring friends and family here for the brews, bbq, slots, etc. I drive past too many other casinos to get there that will not treat me like asking for 3-$1 chips is a criminal offense.\n\n1 star.\n\nWelcome to the Hall of Shame."

The Amber is my favorite, and has a strong caramel flavor, slightly sweet finish, no hopping to speak of. The light is essentially Bud/MGD but made locally. Nothing special. The Weiss features only minimal wheat, clove, spice fruity flavors, so think American wheat beer rather than German hefeweizen. The stout is a slightly less roasty Guiness, easy to drink though, and the IPA is nothing of the kind. Last time I had it I thought it was the light at first. The IPA has really little to no bitterness, hop flavor or aroma. 20 IBUs perhaps? Don't expect much from it if you are a craft beer drinker.\nThey are known for having decent, super cheap food, so go here for the food or gambling, not the beer."

It's been like 2-3 weeks since I came here but I really felt compelled to continue my chronicle of my latest trip to Vegas, so here it goes.\n\nThis was my first trip to Ellis Island, but it definitely won't be my last.  This little casino is definitely a little aged.  There is some wear and tear but it only seems to add to the character of this casino.  \n\nMy friends and I came here on a Sunday night because we had heard that they have karaoke at the little bar inside.  Now, if you know anything about me, you know that I love to karaoke.  I dunno why, it's just one of the very few Asian-y things about me.  Anyway, they set up karaoke at around 9:00 PM and what did I see as they were setting up?  Some older gentlemen dressed like Elvis passing out the song lists.  I don't even think they worked for the bar or the MC but they were definitely dressed for the part.  They also sang but I'll let you guess what artist they decided to karaoke.  \n\nAs for me  and my friends, I was the only one willing to suck it up and get up on stage to belt out a few tunes.  So after a few rounds of vodka tonics (very cheap vodka tonics btw) I finally put in my song request and headed up to the stage.  On my 3 song set list: Paul Anka's \"Put You Head On My Shoulder,\" Matchbox Twenty's \"Back 2 Good,\" and Sublime's \"Santeria.\"  \n\nAs if stiff drinks and karaoke weren't enough for me to become completely enamored with Ellis Island, they also have an awesome pizza place in the casino.  What's also great is that you can grab a pizza and bring it inside the bar to enjoy.  \n\nAh Ellis Island, you'e definitely a diamond in the rough."

The best deal in Vegas? I should say so!!!\n\nThis place is walking distance from the Strip, and a much better value than what you've find a few blocks away.  I was confused when I first walked in, and didn't know where the restaurant was. It's NOT the barbeque area, where the big vats of beer are, with only a few tables.  It's a more conventional restaurant set-up, on the other side.  They don't take reservations and there is usually a wait, but there's a casino to spend your time in.\n\nTIP: Sign up for a player's card. You get $10 in free play that you can use instantly. My suggestion? Play something with a relatively high payout like video poker; as soon as you use up the promotional value, you can begin cashing out anything that you earn on top of it. You can easily earn about 75 - 80% of the comp play back at every Vegas casino that gives you comps for signing up for their player's card.\n\nI didn't see any cocktail waitresses while I was there -- but with $2 (actually good) beers and special $2 cocktails, do you really need them?"

They ran out of their prime rib, so we settled with a more expensive dinner option, like chicken parmesan. We waited an hour. One hour. Obviously the ball was dropped somewhere and the service was too bad to check in on us sooner. The chicken parmesan was extra salty, the pasta was way overcooked and soggy. Meh.

Comes with veggies, mashed potatoes(or fries or baked) and a beer/root beer.\n\nWe were here twice and both times I had the $7.99 special. The mashed potatoes were damn good. The steak was perfectly medium rare (though my other friends were not as lucky, so it's kind of a hit/miss but they come fairly close to what you order). Their hefeweizen was alright.\n\nThe best part about this place is that you can eat for free. I'm not sure if it was a special or not, but after we ate, we went to the other side of the casino and signed up for the membership. It's free to signup and you get $10 of free game play. You play a bit and you have a chance of winning a couple of bucks, then just cash out and you just got yourself a free dinner. :)\n\nI'm definitely going to come back to this place."

That being said, the steak I got with my dinner was terrible.  I ordered my steak medium-rare, and it came out more on the well done side of medium-well.  It was quite dry and not all that tasty.  My GF ordered her steak medium-rare as well, and her steak was actually pretty good, so maybe I got unlucky, but the chefs need to work on their consistency.  I got the lager with my dinner and it was very good.  You can't get much for seven bucks in Vegas, so I can't complain too much, but I expected at least a decent steak."

The food and beer here was the highlight. 20 oz. glasses of beer, brewed there on the premises for $1.50. You cant beat that! I especially liked the Weiss. In comparison, a bottle of Heineken at Planet Hollywood (where I was staying) costs $7.00.\n\nI ate there twice. Once in the restaurant and once in the BBQ restaurant. I had the steak special (comes with a beer for $6.99) and the rack of ribs ($11.99) [both recommended on Yelp.] Both dinners were fantastic! Well worth the money and the wait. We had to wait about an hour to get into the BBQ restaurant.\n\nThe karaoke was fun but was pretty crowded both times I went. The song selection was decent, but on the nights I was there, there was a problem with the machine and many of the songs weren't working. They claim it is the best Karaoke in Vegas but I doubt it. I would only say that it was ok. \n\nThe casino was fun. There are loads of slot machines. There are a couple blackjack tables but no poker. \n\nThere are a lot of older folks and regulars hanging around this place. I didn't see any drunks or homeless people in here (as stated in other reviews). This place is old school Vegas. Its kinda dumpy and smoky, but thats the way I like it.

Comparatively, this place has got pretty standard diner fare. You can't go wrong with the breakfasts (steak and eggs are pretty popular at under $8), and the atmosphere is old school and delightfully kitshy. The main dining room at their cafe features walls of ocean battle scenes...dark, creepy, and hilarious. Recently we spent under $30 on breakfast for three people: NY Steak and Eggs (with good wheat toast and delicious fried potatoes), Bacon and eggs (with toast and potatoes), Cinnamon French Toast, and Pork Chops and eggs (also with toast and potatoes). A round of drinks plus an 18% tip...and the check was still at only $28. Ample free parking and apparently a brewery, too (although I didn't try it).

Sodas are also only $1.  \n\nThe ribs, while they are not perfect, are very, very good and better than any buffet quality that I've had in Vegas.  \n\nOne of the tricks I've realized is that they purposefully force people to wait for a bit.  This weekend, we were told that there would be a 30 minute wait but when we got inside, there were tons of empty tables.  They must be doing it to encourage people to play at the slots or tables for half an hour beforehand.  Oh well.  \n\nThe last thing I should mention is that while it is off the strip, it's actually pretty walkable back to the main strip.  About 15 minutes or so?  \n\nIf you can resist the urge during the wait and if you are looking for a nice bargain, head over to Ellis Island for some ribs!"

Just a solid old school Vegas experience."

It was funny when we met the rest of our group here and they all looked at me like I was crazy for suggesting this place. Well at the end of breakfast I was king!!!!!!  Great experience and our little waitress (she was little) Lucy was a true diamond in the rough. Best waitress I have ever had. Made jokes and just had so much happiness in her."

Figured if I'm not in the club, I can go karaoke and laugh at people...you know, make a night out of it ;)\n\nThe karaoke bar was pretty packed and we were surprised to find a table open. We ordered some Courvoisier since they didn't serve Henny and just enjoyed the show. \n\n\nEveryone was semi-drunk, which is always fun. And everyone was singing along to pretty good singers. SO GOOD that I think they have ringers there; like some guy that was dressed like Elvis sang a pretty-darn-good version of Blue Hawaii.\nThe folks sang: Nothing but a G thang, Bohemian Rhapsody, and even Adele. \n\nIt was a great mix of bad and great singing that I think I had more fun here than I would've at the club.... at least, this is what I tell myself!\n\nAfter the karaoke closed up, we ate at the 24 hour caf\u00e9 they have and it was really good stuff. Menu was very diverse that my friend had breakfast, another had chicken and gravy, and I had the prime rib. All of which was less than $12.\n\nThe whole old looking run-down-ness of the hotel just adds to my interest in this place. I love old Vegas and this is a reminder of yesteryear just blocks from \"The Strip!\"\n\nI cannot wait to go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSomeone come with me because I can't seem to find ppl to go withhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

I have eaten steak all over the country, at high end steak houses that did not compare to this comped masterpiece.  I am not sure who they had cooking that night but they know how to cook!!!

The entrees are huge, the food excellent, and the prices cheap!   The waiter even gave us all \"member's discounts\" when none of us were members.

I really don't remember much from that night. I do remember drinking many beers there though. Anyways, I recently stopped back at Ellis Island for breakfast the other morning because some people I know said they had good steak and eggs.\n\nEllis Island is on Koval Ln just South of Flamingo Road. It is connected to a Super 8 Motel or a Hotel 8. It's something like that. I know there is an 8 in the name. You don't need to know the hotel name anyways. I am sure it is not on my list of hotels I would like to stay at. Like I said, we are talking about the corner of Flamingo and Koval. If your from Vegas you know what I mean.\n\nAs far as the casino goes....not somewhere I would gamble, that is if I gambled. It is a very small casino and it looks like it should be located on Flamingo and Koval. I think I saw 2 pits in there. They also have some slot machines like every other building in this city. There is a bar in the middle of the casino that is a local favorite for many employees of neighboring casinos in the area. There is also a very small Metro Pizza location there. It is also a brewery, so they have a section where they brew and store their beer. It is a very old place and the decor is out dated.\n\nOh yeah. Steak & eggs. The reason I stopped in there. It was $5.99 for a New York Strip, eggs, potatoes, and toast. The steak was not grass fed dry aged steak by any means, but it was okay for a $5.99 breakfast. I have had worse steaks at much nicer restaurants that costed me at least twice as much, so taking the cost of the breakfast in to consideration....I got what I paid for. I also had scrambled eggs, country potatoes, and toast. All of which were okay. Again, $5.99.\n\nI would recommend  stopping in for breakfast at Ellis Island once in a while if you work in the area. It is not a place I would drive out of my way to eat at though."

My meal also came with a baked potato. Mmmmm.. For $8.99, I was really satisfied with the food. However, there were a few bites of the pork chop cutlet that was really salty. \n\nThe rest of my party all ordered the top sirloin 24/7 breakfast plate. It came with the obvious top sirloin, 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes, and toast for $10.99. They all ordered it medium rare, however, when the food came out, all their meat was cooked differently. The consistency in food quality was not there. \n\nFood: 3 stars\nService: 4 stars"

However the great prices make up for a lot. You can get a steak that actually good about 50% of the time, the other 50% of the time its chain (Ponderosa) steak house quality. Included is potato, toast, salad and beer for less than $10. \n\nAn even better deal during NFL games - 2 small but tasty tacos, jumbo hotdog or an order of 5 wings for $1 each. Even better a choice of 5 in-house brewed beers, 20 oz.., all very for $1, all are very good. Throw in NFL Sunday ticket and it's hard to beat.\n\nDecor nothing special, a little run down. \n\nEllis Island takes you back 20 years when you could eat and drink cheap."

There is a special if you sign up for their players card (free service) you can get a steak dinner with sides and a 20 oz beer for like $8. The beer is delicious and cheap.

I would say this is a great place to be if you're tired of the Strip because it's the opposite.  It isn't expensive or glamorous but it offers $2 beers, good steak, and some solid table play.\n\nMy husband and I were last here on our roadtrip to Yellowstone.  We came for dinner on a Friday night.  There was a 50 minute wait, which we hadn't anticipated- I guess it's no secret that Ellis Island has the best affordable menu in Las Vegas.  While waiting to be seated we spent time at the bar, enjoying our pints and playing video blackjack.\n\nWe also had a lot of fun people watching, especially checking out the karaoke.  I loved the $13 prime rib special- really huge portions and that $13 includes another beer!\n\nWe left Ellis Island satisfied and plenty entertained for less money than cover at Hakkasan.  If you're lowkey like us it will be worth your time."

Steak was hmm.. quality you'd get at costco (by the way, no matter how you order it, it comes out the same way), baked potato and beans you'd also be able to get at costco and the root beer was one of the highlights.   It isn't carbonated and room temperature.  My guess is that they brewed it themselves (they're supposed to be the #1 microbrewery in NV).  Personally, I liked the root beer and they put it in a beer glass so you don't look like you're wimping out.   Place is a bit ehhhh, the place is just called \"restaurant\" (straight ahead of the entrance and oh yeah... $6.99 deal is not on the menu.. just ask for it) and service is HORRIBLE.

Let's just say that it wasn't my idea to come here in the first place but a friend of mine suggested it after we left a concert. I am all for giving places the benefit of doubt so with that being said I agreed! Let's talk about service and how it's completely non existent in this place. I believed we arrived maybe around 2:00 AM seated quickly but that's when the problems started. Our server this morning was JOEY and wow what a smart ass he was. I didn't appreciate his service at ALL. Our table had questions on the menu and he just had this nonchalant ass attitude with us and thought that it was funny. I specifically had my issue with him because I decided on the Italian style omelet and inquired about having it made with egg whites. I asked him if it was possible and he says of course but it will be a charge ranging from maybe $2-4? I'm thinking to myself how don't you know the FIRM ACTUAL up charge on this but whatever he checked with the source whomever that was and confirmed it was $2. You are the server so know your menu! I said that's no problem at all go ahead and order it! When our food came everybody's plate came correct but mine. Want to guess what didn't get done? Yep! My omelet came full of cholesterol and yellow as ever! It was clear that my simple request didn't get put in because he was to busy being so damn condescending. We brought this to his attention right away and he brought me a small plate to scoop my plate of potatoes on and the says \"well do you want me to have them make it over\" DUH wtf? After about 20 minutes I had finished my side order of pancakes and some of my friends plate because she felt bad that I still hadn't received my order. Another person in our party didn't et her wheat toast that came with her meal and had asked 3 times for it! Just a complete train wreck he was unapologetic for all this and then when our bill came we had a random 6oz New York steak and eggs added to our bill and I was double charged for my omelette. When again we brought this to his attention he says oh only the manager can fix this hold on, took the bill and went missing! After waiting about 10-15 minutes we still haven't got our correct bill so we spotted the manager TRICIA who was behind the scenes flagged her down and said can we get this done asap?! Her response was somewhat like she cared and when I pulled her to the side to let her know the unacceptable behavior from her serve JOEY and the lack of hospitality she apologized. Did nothing about the bill though they made sure they still collected them coins! Won't be back that's for sure!"

This place is situated right next to a Motel 8 and so you are a bit skeptical. However, don't judge a book by its cover because this place had fast service and friendly hospitality. \n\nThe first time I went, the quality of the steak was great because it was juicy and savory. They made my meal to perfection and to order. They even did it with the 7+ people we had. Sadly though the second time we went, my meal was okay, however, the others had different cooked steaks. One ordered medium rare and ended up with well done. I don't mind mine well done so I didn't have any negative thoughts for my second trip, but my friends would differ. All in all, this is one place to go and try especially at night because the steak and eggs were only $6.99! YES! $6.99!"
