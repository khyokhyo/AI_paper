We came in and were seated promptly. They had a booster seat for our daughter and were prompted with our order. The service there was very good. The food however was a different story. I ordered the chicken Marsala and my wife got the ravioli's. The ravioli's were good but the presentation was abut tricky. It was on this massive plate covered in marinara and looked like more than it actually was. We ordered a side of the garlic bread which, while it tasted decent, could've been so much better. The cheese on it was a bit bland and it just looked so much better than it actually was. My chicken Marsala which came with spaghetti was not to my liking. Way too much Marsala in the sauce and way to runny. You take a chance with anyones chicken Marsala and this time I lost. All in all it just didn't live up to what I would expect good Chicago pasta to be like. But then again we are in Vegas."

The meatballs tasted like meat mushed together and didn't even taste like meat. Even more disappointing getting home and wondering where the heck was the meat sauce!  Come on guys you think for that price you can place more than a scoop of sauce on the pasta."

But for now this place is it. I always get the deep dish whenever I order from here and it's great. somehow I feel that I am missing out on some other items from this place. I get it either delivery or pick up so I've never eaten inside but seems like a great atmosphere for pizza. staff is friendly. it is more expensive than the typical pizza chain but it's worth it. It's way better than Rosati's when it comes to stuffed pizza. if u like Chicago style stuffed pizza try this place!"

            "review": "This was our first time ordering from Amore Taste of Chicago. We ordered a personal sized stuffed pizza which feeds 2-4 people, chicken fettuccine Alfredo and a cannoli.  Our total for these items was $45.26. After one (1) hour after having called our order in, the food was delivered. We both had a slice of pizza and fettuccine. The pizza was hot and smelled so good. It tasted like good pizza-but nothing to write home about.. However, the bottom crust was doughy and not cooked through. We didn't eat it. The fettuccine was creamy but not very flavorful, the chicken was pretty good though-I was glad to see that had been cooked thoroughly. Finally the cannoli-I would say this was the best part of our meal."

            "review": "I have ate here many times and today we had the worst service out of the many times. I am doing this review so the owners can see this and address with their staff. So first we always get the sampler platter and they allow me to sub the zucchini for toasted ravioli, now the waitress when we ordered cut me off in mid sentence of me asking to swap them out that it's \"not allowed\". So I ordered something else. The next issue was mid way through the appetizer my husband needed a refill our waitress was not paying attention to us. Another server comes and brings our pizza and is gone before I can clear my mouth of food to ask for a refill\nEven though she should of noticed I give it 5 mins and finally take his glass to the front where when she saw me coming she hurried to me I ask for root beer and she brings the cup back now not once does she apologize for me having to come to her for a refill she goes back to chatting with another waitress. We also noticed at the end of our meal the waitress never brought out the complementary bread with the tomato topping To us but the other tables had them and we normally get them. I had to flag down another waitress to have out leftovers put in a box. Not once were we asked how or meal was or nothing. This is not the type of service we are use to when we dine here, out waitress was not friendly and would rather socialize than do what she is being paid to do. I love their food but I refuse to spend my money in a place with poor service."

On my third day straight of pasta for dinner figured perfect opportunity check out Amore Taste of Chicago. I know the deep dish pizza is the one dish that gets rave reviews. I was in more of pasta mood. I do intend come back try the deep dish.\n\nTalk about from the minute walk in the place screams Chicago. I have had the pleasure visiting Chicago years ago for friends wedding. Some of the famous landmarks or touristy spots in the city been there done that in life. All around the restaurant every wall is collage of those iconic landmarks more so sports as main focus. Wrigley Field. The Chicago Blackhawks and Chicago Cubs. I can appreciate any business more less restaurant that gives shout out too NHL or ice hockey. If your Cubs or Blackhawks this IS the spot check out games. Just happens the Cubs in the post season. I came for dinner one night they were playing and couple tables full on Cubs fan in jerseys. All full engaged in the game. They have three wide screens decent size around the restaurant so NO way not going miss Cubs or Blackhawk game. One more note about shout out for hockey. They have team picture of the Blackhawks with Lord Stanley Cup on the wall. \n\nI started with house salad. Talk about decent size salad. It was on big oval plate not small bowl or tiny plate. I went with the house italian dressing. Everything together was refreshing and great starter dish. Pasta keep it simple Penne with meat sauce. The Penne was cooked perfect nice al dente. The sauce was ok. It was nice hearty lots of ground meat in it. The tomato sauce tasted fresh with nice body to it. Overall nothing that blew me away taste. Definitely dish would order again. The portion size they give you is huge. Price is very reasonable across the menu. I need try the deep dish pizza next visit. \n\nThe service was solid. My waitress was friendly, on top of things, and did great job."

            "review": "My hubby's favorite pizza. He says nothing beats the stuffed pepperoni & sausage. \nYes it's a bit filling, but it's deep dish.. and yes it's about a 45 minute wait time, but it's worth the wait. We haven't had any other pizza like it. The tomato sauce and tomatoes are so zesty and fresh. We usually get it when we have family in town or friends over because there's so much and it's a no-fail pizza for guests. It makes great leftovers if it's oven-warmed. He prefers carry-out, though we've dined in before. We'll have to try the mozzarella sticks the next time we decide to get a table if it's not too crowded."

The crust isn't doughy, the bottom of the pie is crusted lightly, and the thickness of it smothered with the a sweet sauce, melted cheese and assorted meats is just like eating, well, a pie.\n\nMy husband knows it takes a while for one of these big pizza's to cook, so he manages to pre order and when we walk in, they are expecting us and we are seated right away and a juicy hot pizza is delivered to our table.   No waiting!\n\nThe staff are friendly, eager to please and always prompt.  The pizza's great here!"

            "review": "We've noticed this place and have been meaning to go in. I got a recommendation from a coworker who was a native Chicagoan so we had to check it out. It just took forever because whenever we're in this parking lot, we're heading into Naked Fish's. It took an extreme exercise in control for us not to head in even when our intention was to get some deep dish pizza.\n\nWith that being said, we went in, grabbed a seat, and ordered drinks, fried zucchini as an appetizer, and awaited our food. Decor was a splattering of Chicago sports teams and celebrities. Tables were spaced nicely so different parties didn't intrude upon one another's conversation. The fried zucchini was yummy. We saw other people being served before us who had arrived after, and after about 40 minutes, finally inquired with our waitress why that was. She explained deep dish took longer (we should have known, but it was our first time and would have been nice for her to ask and advise so we weren't getting frustrated). \n\nIn another couple of minutes, our pizza was out, and my, was it worth the wait. (Although, we'll probably call ahead to avoid the wait). We ordered it with pepperoni, pineapple and jalapeno. All conversation dwindled to muffled groans and MMMMMs full of hot, melty goodness with crust that was to die for. We were embarrassed because after all the grumbling that happened, we were all silenced after one slice apiece. It made for pretty good leftovers."

If you answered yes to all three of those questions, look no further this is the place. \n\nWe had that nagging crazing for some pizza at work and we all tend to lean more towards the deep dish side of things so we decided to try this place out. We ordered 2 large Deep dish pizzas for the 6 of us and when we finished we had an entire pizza left, this did not happen because we didn't like it, it happened because this is massive pizza. There is no shortage of meat, cheese and sauce and it is definitely not floating in grease like some other pizzas we have ordered in the past. \n\nI really don't have anything bad to say about the quality of the food or service here. This is a class act in the world of pizza Pies. Searching for good pizza is a mission that many of us find ourselves embarking on and this is one stop you do not want to miss."

            "review": "Let a real Chicagoan review this deep dish pizza! This is all I have had so far was a deep dish cheese pizza for $18 excluding delivery fee. It was an hour and a half wait but they told me that right from the get-go so that is okay. They took my credit card info without even telling me how much my total was first, which I found odd. This deep dish is no more than extra thick crust! The only thing deep about it was the crust. Had the same amount of cheese as a regular thin crust. I hope you like really sweet sauce because this is how it is.The crust was also overly dense and on the hard side. I called and wanted to 'exchange' one of the deep dishes for a regular thin crust. No-one wanted to eat it, not even my 3 & 4 year old.  I am not one to send food back but I just couldn't justify spending $42 (with tip)  on a pizzas that I felt sucked. The woman on the phone was not too overly friendly and as a matter of fact said \"That is just how our pizza is, I seen it come out of the oven.\" To me that is just bad customer service. In the end after a 10 min hold time I was informed that the manager was sending out a thin crust in exchange for the uneaten deep dish.  The one star rating is more for the pizza itself. I guess I would rate the customer service at more like a 2 since they did exchange my pizza with little hassle, although it was another 1.5 hour wait! The thin crust was much better but I wont order again since the sauce is way to sweet for me."

We drive from downtown 25 minutes each way to get there on a Sunday around noon. No one is in there. A strip mall cheap place with posters on the walls and cheap looking plastic red chairs. No beer either... I wanted the specialty pizza, but half margarita and half pepperoni. Other places do it like Grimaldi's. But not here. So ok, I order a margarita pizza and just add some pepperoni on it. It came out with red sauce. I asked the server if I had the right pizza and was assured I did. I ate a couple of pieces. Then asked another server if a margarita pizza should have red sauce instead of white. Of course it's white. So she states maybe they were just out of white sauce. She comes back from the kitchen and said they made a mistake so I had pepperoni with spinach on it. I had eaten about 25% of it to this point. I stated, it was just ok pizza and I didn't feel like I should have to be forced into eating something I did not order  and advised I didn't want to pay for it. She rudely said, if you eat it you will pay for it. I said, then take it now. Really, no better option. Was I supposed to wait another 40 minutes after others where done... Grrr...So I did not eat. We contacted the owner through the Chicago Facebook page, he said he'd look into it. Nine days later he finally replied \" why don't we just come back there and have a free pizza on him\". Really.., drive another 45 minutes round trip passing other pizza places I love like Grimaldis, Pieology and Pizza Rock. They could have made it right the first time and chose not too. No thanks. I never will return no matter how much advertising they do, not worth it."

            "review": "IMHO, best Chi town style pizza in Vegas, pan & thin.  That said, the crust is not perfect (needs more cornmeal on the bottom of the thin), but the sauce & other ingredients are spot on.  Service was efficient and friendly. Restaurant atmosphere is so so. Too bright, & over the top. Not \"warm\" & inviting. Kinda like cafeteria style, with a lot of Chicago memorabilia crap strewn on the walls. Sadly, they didnt even have a Sox game on this night that was scheduled on the many TVs, because they dont pay for the blackout service! Come on! You're a Chicago place! Pop for all the full sports packages to get all the  Chicago games! They said they won't get all the Bears games this fall either.....booooooo.....clearly not a \" true\" Chicago place! Anyway, I digress. Prices are rather high; thin crust pizza runs 23.00, ( largest thin crust with one ingredient),  same pizza in Chicago is probably, 14.00 (at Vito & Nicks anyway).   Furthermore, they miss on the Italian beef sandwich.  I don't think it's authentic Gonella bread, or the same kind of Chicago beef, & the gravy (dipped au jus), was very bland. The giardinare was terrible. I will go back for the pizza for sure, but order ahead to avoid the long wait for the pan pie. Or better yet, order in for delivery."

By places like this I mean small, seemingly family owned, authentic, hole-in-the-wall places that give you a \"you came for the food not the atmosphere\" vibe. There is no fluff to this restaurant - the tables and chairs are reminiscent of a high school cafeteria. They don't need to impress you with fancy chairs and decor - though - because they know the food is what will keep you coming back. They started us off with a free bruschetta, and as surprised as I was I was in love with it. If I hadn't wanted to try more for the review I would have ordered an appetizer of them! As it is, I did want more variety and we had the calamari and split a caprese salad. The salad was disappointing but I think it's mostly the presentation. You get several fat slices of mozzarella so I wouldn't say it was small, but it felt small. They should move it to a smaller plate because I think my mind was playing tricks on me - I thought they certainly couldn't be charging eight dollars for that.\n\nHowever, the calamari was a saving grace. Delicious and deep fried - the only part that confused me was that it came with a sweet chili sauce. The kind I would normally dip lumpia into. It came with regular pizza sauce too, however, and that satisfied me. It was watery and chunky - I prefer others but it wasn't by any means bad. Then the killer - the pizza you waited 45 minutes for!! We got a double pepperoni and I was stuffed after one slice. I wish the crust on the bottom was softer for a deep dish but it was still worth the wait. Reheating this pizza the next day was AMAZING though. It's one of those foods that is better as a leftover."

The amount of fries they give you for $2.00 is not worth it. My friend had the cheese fries and the cheese kind of tasted like a cheese-wiz substance and they charge an extra dollar for that. \n\nI don't know if they were understaffed but the service was adequate. Took awhile just to get our drink order taken. And over 20 min to get 4 sandwiches served to our table. And I did not hear the waitress ask us how our food was. \n\nAll in all the experience was alright. After reading the reviews for the deep dish pizza, I might give them another chance and go back to try that!"

No need to hop on a plane to go all the way to Gino's when we have Amore Taste of Chicago here in Vegas. My favorite thing about it... It's hard to narrow it down to only one so here's a few. Their sauce is so flavorful and made from real crushed tomatoes. The ingredients are extremely fresh. Their thick crunchy cornmeal crust is never oily. Every time I have ordered from here, my pizza has been perfectly cooked. \n\nI love this pizza! I'm just mad that I tried it because now I'm hooked and I'm going to get fat. When I become too out of shape and have to give up modeling because of this guys, I blame Amore! It's all their fault! Don't say I didn't warn you. ;)"

The only thing that I liked was the fact they have the triangle shaped mozzarella \"sticks\", hey were our appetizer. The staff seemed friendly and it really seemed like we were going to make it through the experience without any issues!\n\nThe pizza came out, it looked good, smelled good.  But it just didn't taste right... as if something had spoiled or was not kept at the right temp... I say this because it was VERY odd on the ride home I felt this RUSH of nausea hit me.  We got home & I thought to myself, \"dang this pizza was the only thing we both had all day!\"\n\nSo 25 minutes later from when we left this place.  I turn to my boyfriend and asked him, \"Do you feel really ILL? Like Nausea?\"  He nodded and we both had this disgusted look our faces hoping for the best. NOPE! I was violently sick FIRST, and then him soon after.  It hit both of us without warning & thank god... we have 2 bathrooms.  I'm super upset, it was overpriced AND GOT US SICK?  I don't think that was a conicidence at all.\n\nMy boyfriend called (after we gathered what was left of our strength, I had a sore throat all day).  The manager had the NADS to ask if we were SURE it was his food.  No, we just ate there 30 minutes ago & felt like giving you a hard time & playing a sick joke on your staff (sarcasm).  I'm still very upset about the whole situation, how can you not take your customer's seriously?  Maybe an appology to the both of us?  I don't think I'll ever recommend this place to anyone.  If you screwed up once, you're out with me.\n\nBesides the Tropicana has pizza that will knock your socks off. It's really cheap to eat if you're a local, 1.50 a slice.   But we can dine at anywhere for half off, plus their calzones are out of this world at their cafe."

Please - really, please - the grown ups are talking; just be quiet now and go back to your normal hang at Papa John's.  Seriously, though, this is the best Chicago style pizza I have found in Vegas; and, the price is exceptionally reasonable for what you're getting.  The only thing I can think of to ding them about is that the seats might be a little comfier since you'll be spending some time in them (as proper Chicago pizza takes time to prepare).  With that said, the service was attentive and friendly and the pizza (a large stuffed with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions) was through-and-through delicious."

Seriously, D-voured it. My reason for not loving the pizza is probably the same reason that makes this pizza so fabulous for almost everyone else...cheese. Amore's pizzas are absolutely loaded, dripping, oozing with hot, gooey cheese.  Which apparently is only an issue for me. I prefer my pie with tons of crushed tomatoes, lots of yummy veggies and very lightly sprinkled with just a smidgen of mozzarella. I know that I'm in the minority here so when my group of six suggested a trip to this eatery I happily went along for the company and the beer, which, much to my dismay, they don't serve. Frown.\n\nThe view from here is amazing. The entire front wall of this restaurant is one giant window with an unobstructed view of the fabulous Las Vegas Strip. The decor is pretty cool as well. The walls are over-crowded with photographs from cityscapes to movie stars and athletes. They have a really nice panorama of the Chicago skyline right when you walk in the front door. It's an overall inviting atmosphere thanks to the decor and the staff. We were greeted and seated immediately upon walking in and were very well taken care of throughout the meal. We sat around talking for a good bit after the meal and bill were taken care of and the waitress still kept checking on us periodically. She even brought out a large platter with a generous potion of zeppoles (fried dough strips) for dessert on the house. They were fresh from the fryer and topped with powdered sugar and a drizzle of honey. Very nice finishing touch."

It requires fork and knives because it's so deep dish thick, the pizza is pretty heavy in both meanings  The crust taste is great and the toppings, well it does just that, tops it off to a great Chicago Style Pizza.

The crust is perfectly crisp, a lot of toppings and have the perfect amount of sauce and cheese. Best part, all made to order, be ready to wait 45minutes or call your fine in order ahead of time and show up when your pizza is ready! They will have a nice little reserved plaque on a table waiting for you and will bring your pizza out once you're seated."

However, every time I walk into that place. It's true. I am in love. Amore Taste of Chicago is by far the closest thing I have to Chicago style food in Las Vegas. \n\nI must admit the first time I went I may have gone a little overboard with my friends (who are Chicago natives)  . We first decided just to get a deep dish pizza and a salad. You know to keep it fresh and light. Then we happened to see they have thin crust pizza. So we got that to.  Oh and maybe a few Chicago style hot dogs. \n\nGet off my back man. We were excited! \n\nNeedless to say everything was delicious. You really can't go wrong. However, some people at the table preferred thin crust to deep dish. Things were civil... until a pepperoni was thrown.\n\nAs for me, I loved them both. Deep dish, thin crust. I don't care. Amore puts a whole lotta love into all their dishes.             \n\nThe family atmosphere I believe makes the experience even more wonderful. The place was packed with families wearing their Chicago sports team apparel . Not to mention the staff which makes you feel like you have been going there for years!\n\nAmore Taste of Chicago is by far one of my  favorite places to dig in & I suggest you do  the same! \n\nMy Tips:\n 1) When ordering a deep dish, know that they can take up to 45 min to               make. Trust me its worth the waits. \n2) DO NOT walk into Amore's wearing an other sports apparel besides Chicago teams. It's just polite. \n\n\nDA BEARS"

As we enter, Rosemary and another Bulgarian gentleman (didn't get his name) is there to greet us.\n\nWe mentioned that it was our first time there, and as she mentions in the video, they are known for their deep dish pizza, so our lunch was already decided. She also said that the 50-year old oven they use and the Pizza Maker came from Chicago. How Much more authentic can you get? We entrusted Rosemary who has been there over 5 years and is a local from Chicago as well, and went with her suggestions- no more than 5 toppings, and we went with what she suggested:\nSuasage, Pepperoni, Ricotta, Garlic, and the MUST HAVE Hot Giardinera Peppers. Already knowing about the 45 minute wait, Rosemary Suggested the Fried Ravioli which was a great starter.Crisp outside, creamy Ricotta inside and a chiffonade of basil sprinkled on top, went very well with the warm marinara.\n\nOur pizza arrives, and Rosemary serves up our first slices. First bite, flavor explosions in my mouth! The SWEET hand crushed tomatoes, creamy ricotta, meaty sausage, whole roasted garlic cloves, crispy pepperoni, and the mild heat of the giardinera all worked together in harmony with the crisp, buttery crust...this is the only way I'll have my stuffed pizza...Rosie's way!

So, when the family decided it was time to go out to eat, the majority voted for Italian and I let out a \"BOO!\" accompied with a pouty-face. \n\nWhen Olive Garden was suggested, I quickly re-routed the decision and we landed at ATC. It was a busy parking lot and my grandmother is O2 dependent and uses a walker. Since the place has huge windows, the manager saw this and opened a side door for us. This set the tone for the wonderful service we would receive throughout the night.\n\nWe were seated right away, a waitress came over, took our drink order and handed us menus. The menu is extensive. Tons of pasta dishes, soups, salads, sandwiches, meats, pizzas, and house specialities. Pizzas take about 40 minutes to make so we passed. There is also a separate pizza counter for people placing to-go orders or who opted for pick up.\n\nDrinks came out with the quickness as well as the perfect crusty homemade italian bread. Freshly baked, crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. We each ordered a cup of the soup (minestrone) and needed a bit longer to peruse the menu. \n\nMinestrone was great. A lot veggies, homemade, and it had a little, tiny kick to it. Bravo! Never tasted a soup like this before.\n\nI've recently broken up with gluten. So I was stoked to see gluten free pasta available. I ordered gluten-free pasta and asked for a spicy arrabiata. It was awesome garlicky, flavorful, and packed heat.\n\nOther dishes were sausage and peppers, with smacks of gardeny fresh peppers, mild Italian sausage and excellently balanced sauce. The baked rigatoni was also excellent and came with a massive amount mozzarella cheese. So heavenly sinful! (Did I just make an oxymoron, uh...) \n\nOur servers worked in a team effort, drinks were full, we never left wanting or waiting. The owner stopped by our table to see how everything was and told us about his establishment. I'm always way impressed when I see a hands on approach.\n\nI love that there is a quality, decently priced, casual Italian place in my next of the woods. When I am feeling some sort of self-hate, I'm going to get all up in that deep dish. I think we'll be instant besties (damn you, gluten).\n\nI'm totally in Amore with Amore and love is never wrong."

It was fine, the most impressive part being the walls filled with Chicago greats and not having to wait for a table at 2:30 PM on a Sunday.  OH and there are several good sized, good quality TVs for your sports viewing pleasure.  Which was nice since the US Open was on.  \n\nWe started with the house salad -- it's not an antipasto or a great house salad at that -- it's ICEBERG lettuce, cucumbers, onions and tomatoes.  Their house Italian is more of a balsamic which I really didn't mind, but the salad was less than impressive.  I am not an iceberg lettuce fan, but luckily my husband is and he finished it off.  \n\nTheir tomato sauce is a little on the tangy side, which is fine.  My daughter wasn't crazy about it, but I do realize tomato sauce is a personal preference kind of thing.  She ordered the spaghetti and meatball (one big meatball) and was satisfied.  She also ordered garlic bread which was waaaay garlickly - I know, I know, it's supposed to be, but my husband and I could still taste the garlic in our teeth two hours later!!  \n\nThe pizza . . . . they told us it'd be 45 minutes, but it was actually 25.  Bonus!  Maybe it's because we ordred the homemade sausage, pepperoni and green pepper and didn't stuff it full?  It was good - it wasn't great, not quite like thick, oozing goodness of Lou Malnati's or Pizzeria Due in Downtown Chicago, but it was still delicious.  The crust wasn't too thick or too doughy which in my book, is a good thing.  If I ever crave deep dish, I would probably, maybe return, but I wouldn't make a special trip to do so.  A note on size, the small is 8 pieces and was more than enough for 2 adults.\n\nThe other bummer was . . . . no beer?  No wine?  Beer and pizza make a great meal  in my book!

Chicken Vesuvio: A Pair of Chicken Skinless Chicken Fillet drenched in a pool of olive oil with herbs, spices and Garlic! I Mean Infused with Garlic! And 4 Large Slices of Potato Wedges. Presented on a Large Rectangle Plate.. Just Beautiful! Nicely Portioned and Taste So Gooood!\n\n2. Deep Dish Pepperoni & Sausage Pie: Takes them approximately 45 minutes to prepare! Now this was more of a Pizza Pie! Thick, Saucey, Not too Cheesy and Toppings (especially the sausage) were a Hit! The Crust kind of crumbled like a Apple Pie crust. I haven't had too many Deep Dish Pies but this one is much better than Rosati's by a few miles!!\n\n* Other Orders Not quite as good but decent: Chicken Marsala, Spaghetti with Meatballs (meatballs enormous like Buca Di Beppo), Minestrone Soup, House Salad with creamy garlic dressing (dressing kinda sweet). \n\nWhen I feel Deep Dish Pizza Pie, I come here. If I'm not feeling CPK's \"Chicken Milanese\" (btw one of their healthiest entrees and its damn good!) but still want chicken thats more unique, I come here for the Vesuvio. Service average but our Last Visit here the Service was Better. More Prompt and Comforting because of our server: \"Erica\". Thanks! Prices a little high but worth the treat once in a while, in my opinon."

They had a nice family and sporting atmosphere; if you like sports or have kids, this place is perfect for you.\n\nThe chicken wings are delicious. Definitely a must try, especially the wings with hotter sauce. We ordered a 14 inch deep-dish pizza with pepperoni on one side and more cheese on the other. Since this was our first time trying Chicago-style pizza, we didnt know what to expect, but we weren't disappointed with it. The pizza was really good; i wanted to eat more, but unfortunately i didnt have room, so we just took it home. The waitresses and staff are courteous as well. All in all, it was a really pleasant experience eating here. Definitely worth the 6 mile drive from the city."

I should have known better than to take the advice of someone from Iowa.  The fried calamari had a ton of batter on, so much that it was crunchy.  Not good.  The Italian Beef was bland, nothing like the Italian Beef sandwiches in Chicago.  And the deep dish pizza certainly wasn't Uno's, or even Lou Malnatis.  If you're looking for Chicago food, I wouldn't go here."

If I could give this a negative star I would, but one star is all I'm allowed to score it.\n\nI called ahead to make a reservation for six people, and two medium pizzas. Two of which cancelled and I called back 6 to 8 minutes later after I had placed the order to try and change the order to just one pizza. The girl that took the call didn't tell me her name, didn't ask what I had ordered, what name the order was for, nothing. She just said,\" The pizzas where already in the oven, sorry.\" And she went to hang up the phone, but so content was she in her blatant lie, that she missed placed the phone and left me still on the other end.\n\nNow normally I'd have just hung up the phone but since she so obviously lied I decided to listen in, as I could still hear her talking. She started to speak to her co-worker and I quote said, \" I can't believe how um like fucking stupid people are, calling a few minutes later to change there order.\" \"Haha, I know right.\" \"I just told him the pizzas were already in the oven.\"\n\nThis is what I heard on the line, before I hung up.\n\nAfter I drove to the place(mind you I live 20-25 minutes away) I confronted the receptionist about what had transpired, with the manager standing next to me, I explained calmly what I had happened. She denied it and said another receptionist had taken the call. Which her co worker than took credit for and said she was the one that took the order. But also denied it. The manager looked at me and said, \"Was this the same tone I heard over the phone?\" referring to the employee standing before.\n\nNo apology from the manager, no offer, nothing. I just couldn't believe it. The girl then said, sorry that you had an unpleasant experience, or something along those lines. I was to angry to give a shit anymore.\n\nI sat down to tell my friends what happened. As we told the server we wont be eating here after the way I was treated, she said and I quote, \"Well what was said wasn't directed at him but you're free to leave.\" And here I was feeling sorry for leaving the server with one less table. Wow.\n\nExtremely horrible service STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS. DO NOT EAT HERE."

Parking was no hassle since its located in a large retail  center.  \n\nI took the suggestions from other yelpers and called in my order a head of time. The pizza wasn't ready after being seated so I ordered an appetizer of shrimp scampi - served with garlic bread. The shrimps were deveined, whole and yummy. When the pizza arrived I was taken back of the thickness and contained homemade sausage, mushrooms and the chunks of tomatoes that were sweet and delicious. The pizza was packed with quality ingredients and the dough was thick but not overly cooked. I ended picking off of three slices all the ingredients and passed on the ends of the crust. \n\nOverall a positive experience here with friendly waitresses who were service oriented! As for the pizza I'm torn between being fan of regular or deep dish. I guess if both were in front of me I would indulge in either or!"

I politely declined and hailed an uber. Already the deck was stacked against me to go to amore.   Got there had a great waitress who was friendly, helpful and attentive.

The only down-side was that it was a bit salty. That's saying a lot since I like salty food but even for me it was too much. I combatted it by dipping my slices into some balsamic vinegar. It was like bomb garlic bread. \n\nThe deep dish was quite disappointing. No real redeeming qualities about it. I couldn't get over the salty sauce. This place would have gotten four stars had the food not been so salty and if the deep dish worth going back for.

On Friday I used my birthday week (yes I said week, LOL) as a caloric excuse and finally made it out to try the best stuffed pizza in our fair city ! \n\nHaving read Yelp and with a certain degree of familiarity with Chicago style pizzas, I knew to call ahead to make sure I could squeeze Amore into my lunch break and still get in and out of there in under an hour. The lunch specials for $5 looked good, but I had to try the stuffed pie to see if this place lived up to my favorite spots in Chicago. Their large with 2 toppings for $15.99 was well priced (on special?), and was ready within the promised 45 minutes. \n\nI'll start with the service - it was fabulous. Our waitress couldn't have been more nice or helpful. The pie was beautiful and looked like the pies I remember in Chicago. Ok, I'll be blunt. This pie was by far the best I've had in Vegas (as far as Chicago stuffed styles go), but definitely isn't \"just like Chicago\". It's like Steve said - it's a nicotine patch equivalent for Chicago pizza addicts. \n\nFor me, the sauce was way too sweet but I realize that's personal preference. The crust while \"bland\" was very true to the style and for me extremely reminiscent of Giordano's . The cheese was extremely gooey and perfect and they didn't skimp on the quantity at all! The toppings were a bit skimpy for my taste (I'd like to see a bit more of them!), but otherwise it was a great pizza.  \n\nWhile this wouldn't be a 5 star joint in Chicago, we are in Vegas after all!  This is the closest most authentic Chicago stuffed style here in town and i look forward to adding this my lunch rotation every once in awhile. The staff was awesome and the price is right."

You can get half a sandwich (meatball, Chicago beef, or Italian sausage) with fries. These are good for lunch time. \n\nIf you really want something delicious though, you gotta get the deep dish pizza. It is delicoussssss!!!! The only down fall for me was I'm not a huge fan of pizza sauce being chunky and it is chunky and kinda sweet. That's why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. If you do order the deep dish pizza though call in advance because it takes about an hour to make. \n\nI have had the three sandwich lunch special mentioned previously. \n\nThe italian sausage was good. Not my favorite out of the three. You can add hot peppers to it for fifty cents I believe and same with the beef sandwich. The beef sandwich gives you a good amount of roast beef on it which more the better in my opinion. \n\nThe meat ball sub was good for an extra buck you can add cheese which is worth it because they give you a good amount. Plus it has, I believe, homemade meatballs on it. Pretty good stuff and the price is hard to beat. It's better than eating at a fast food place for the same price. \n\nThe service is good, they get you what you want in a good amount of time. \n\nGood job guys."

We had originally planned to try another restaurant in the same mall but the other place was empty where as this place was getting busy. I really don't know how I have overlooked this place but glad we came upon it.\n\nIt is not fancy, simple tables with comfortable red chairs for seating. It is kinda like cafeteria style seating but the food servers do take your order from the table. By the time we left, the whole place was almost full. \n\nThey specialize in deep dish Chicago style pizza of course but we were in the mood for an entree. I ordered the Gnocchi and my friend had the Chicken Marsala with a side of pasta. We shared a salad with creamy garlic dressing and some garlic cheese bread. One of the standouts for me was the complimentary bruschetta. It is homemade and made fresh everyday. It was so delicious, most likely the best I have ever had. We had a little side on our salad. My friends Chicken Marsala was so tasty. I only had a small bite but the sauce was made just right, not too sweet and the chicken was tender. I enjoyed the Gnocchi but have had better. The creamy garlic dressing on the salad was delectable! We had no alcoholic beverages but they do offer a small menu of both beer and wine. \n\nThe service was really great and I could tell there were plenty of regulars in the house cutting up and chatting up the servers. I can't wait to go back and delve into the deep dish pizza. I plan to take our good friends from Chicago.\n\nGood food, good service, good value!"

The Cheesy Garlic bread was delicious, could have been hotter, maybe it sat up there a few too many minutes before it was brought to my table. The cheese Ravioli was great, definitely not a lack of sauce on this dish. However, the server should have told me it would be $2.95 to have Alfredo Sauce versus Marinara. I didn't even know until the bill arrived that there was an up charge for that request. It should also be on the menu, under the item. Showing comes with Marinara, but if you want another option it will be $2.95. That would be helpful! The menu prices were just right, not too pricey. Love the fact that you get free refills on sodas. The place was clean, the temperature was perfect and the whole dining experience was really nice.....) I will definitely go back! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!"

The pepperoni had a little spicy taste to it just how I liked it. The crust was amazing. It was really chewy without being overly doughy... if you can even comprehend that. The large was huge! There were three of us, and 4 slices were consumed of it. Over half the pizza was left over, and it tasted good heated up the next day.\n\nWe also ordered mozerella sticks... except they weren't sticks. They were triangles! They were triangles of gooey, crispy, mozerella goodness. I have never had better mozerella sticks ever. We should have ordered 8 instead of 4. \n\nThe atmosphere was nice. There was some Italian music playing in the background, a bunch of baseball/football/chicago in general memorabilia throughout the restaurant.\n\nThe place was dead though. Only one other person came in while we were dining, which is a shame for a place with good pizza. I will definitely be back."

The sauce they use is sweet, but not overpowering. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because I felt that it should have had a bit more pepperoni on the pizza, and because the house salad and bread basket were nothing to write home about. \n\nLooking for terrific deep dish pizza?...

They told us it would take about 45 minutes to get done, which we expected, so we showed up about 30 minutes in to make sure we didn't get cold food. Well, we ended up getting a cold pizza anyway, and even worse, there was hair in it. When we told our waitress, she acted like there was no way it could have happened and made excuses. To be fair, they offered to make a new pizza, but I sure didn't want to wait there another 45 minutes, and I honestly don't know who would.\n\nBefore I found the hair, I still can't say I agree that the deep dish is the best out there. I definitely wouldn't recommend sitting in the place for 45 minutes to wait for it to come out either. Maybe it's because mine was cold and I didn't get the full effect, but I just wasn't a huge fan. There was very little flavor to it, the cheese not being hot and melty wasn't ideal, and the dough felt undercooked. As a whole, it just wasn't right and was really disappointing after hearing how great it's supposed to be.\n\nAbout the only thing I enjoyed on my first visit were the appetizers we ordered. Both the Fried Ravioli and Bruschetta were simple but delicious, and I'd recommend trying either.\n\nAgainst my better judgement, we came back here for a second time...more because it's one of the wifeys favorite spots. This time around, almost everything was much better. Our waitress was extremely nice, had our drinks refilled quickly, and it was overall just a much better experience. I couldn't bring myself to order another deep dish, so this time around I tried something new with the Sausage and Peppers Platter...\n\nI'm actually really surprised to see this isn't talked about more in reviews. It's literally served on a platter with a pretty healthy portion of sausage, peppers, potatoes and onions. The sausage is a nice coarse ground Italian sausage that is cooked perfect, and has just the right amount of spice. Both the peppers and onions were nicely done with still a little bit of crispness and not soggy at all. But what really makes this dish even better is the white wine sauce it's made with. It's absolutely delicious, and everything really soaks in all the flavors from it. Even after I was stuffed from eating it all, I couldn't help but grabbing some of their basket bread and dipping it in the sauce...it really is that good!\n\nHad I reviewed Amore the first time around, it definitely would have been a 1 star review. There really isn't much that I hate more than finding stuff in my food, and usually I wouldn't even go back after I do, especially if it's hair. But I gotta give credit where credits due. The Sausage and Peppers Platter alone is worth coming here for. And if we were to come back with someone who wanted a deep dish, I'd probably give it another shot. I just wouldn't order it again on my own, and with it being one of their signature items, that says a lot.\n\nOverall though, Amore is \"A-OK\"!"

Two slices and that's about all I could handle. \nNext time, I will order on the phone and then dine in 40 minutes later lol."

After a recent trip to Chicago I have had deep dish pizza on the brain.  Based off of another yelp review saying Amore has the best deep dish in Vegas I decided to give it a try.  \n\n14\" deep dish sausage\nThe crust was was what I was expecting, crispy up the sides with that slight fry on the bottom - delicious!  The sausage has a nice taste, not to heavily spiced but enough so you know it is there.  The cheese was good, the sauce was a little too \"fresh\" for me, I like a heavier darker red sauce.  If you know what i mean.  Pizza was huge, a lot of food and we took half of it home.  Tomorrow's breakfast.\n\nWe ordered fried ravioli and fried mozzarella (huge portion).  They brought us a sample of bruschetta which was packed with flavor.\n\nMy wife ordered the Shirmp Diablo, requested it to be mildly spiced and was happy with her meal.\n\nThe service was great!  Our drink order was taken as we sat down and promptly refilled as needed.  We dropped a knife.  One of the servers heard it hit the floor and was on the way with a set of silverware before we even had a chance to ask.  Food came out as it was ready, the wait staff worked as a team delivering food to tables that were not their own.  Our server was very enthusiastic about the food.  I had the impression that she was a big fan of the food she was serving and not just there waiting on tables.\n\nDeep dish takes a while to cook and our server told us it would take 45 minutes.  She gave us a menu and told us to phone ahead next time, they will get the pizza going and save a table for us.\n\nI am looking forward to trying the Italian beef and sausage combo!"

He normally favors NY style pizza (but I'm from Chicago darn it, and you're gonna eat some Chi-town pie and you're gonna like it, mister!

I just wanted a small piece, I am a thin crust fan because deep dish crust is just too much bread for me. And YES, folks, it DOES take 45 minutes to cook a Chicago deep dish pizza, it's freakin thick! It is well worth the wait. \n\nBoth pizzas were delicious. I didn't hear any complaints from my boyfriend about it being a Chicago pizza..maybe because he was chowing down the entire pie. :) I would even go so far as to compare the pizzas to Giordano's or Lou Malnati's.

It was 9:42pm and she said no i'm sorry, I closed down the register. Whats the point of having hours if you turn away good customers before your closing time when they assured us we would be fine. I explained that we had called earlier and you said it was fine, then she said her boss told her no. With the economy these days, turning away business is rediculous.

It is difficult to find true Chicago pizza outside of Chicago. Amore does a good job with their pizza though, especially if you can't travel all the way to Chicago!\n\nThe stuffed pizza is huge and heavy. The outer crust is about 2.5 inches thick (or should I say tall), nice and crispy, the bottom crust is relatively thin and chewy but manages to hold all the ingredients. There's plenty of cheese and all the other toppings tasted fresh. Their sausage is particularly good, having a nice sweet taste of fennel. The sauce has a nice chunky texture and balances sweetness and tanginess pretty well. The pizza is greasy, at least if it has sausage (due to the huge size and amount of toppings) but also very satisfying, believe me if you are hungry and think you can easily eat a normal 14\" pizza, you'll probably only be able to eat half of the 14\" Amore pie.\n\nNote if you order a stuffed pizza to eat in or take out, the pie takes 45 mins to cook.\n\nThe indoors sitting area is decorated with all sorts of pictures and memorabilia from Chicago, overall pretty clean and good service.\n\nIf you want Chicago pizza in Las Vegas, Amore is probably the only real choice (along with Rosati's maybe, and I'd say Pietown but it's closed for now). Their pizza is big, has plenty of toppings and is very satisfying. It's the next best thing if you can't travel all the way to Chicago."

I waited patiently only ordering Chicken Vesuvio, until they recently started carrying gluten-free products.  \n\nNow I realize when ordering in I take the risk of being contaminated, but thankfully not only am I very aware  but as well am a bit paranoid...  I have never had a problem ordering from there gluten or otherwise, until tonight!!  I ordered gluten-free pasta and received the complete opposite in WHEAT!!  I called questioning and it was treated nonchalantly as if a pizza arrived with wrong toppings rather than the fact I was almost poisoned, which would land me in the hospital immediately...  Not only were they completely flippant about what just happened,. I even needed to be the one to bring up about being refunded!  After a brief verbal brawl I finally just gave the phone back to the delivery guy, since he was yelling for it back, he gave us our refund and I handed him back the re-made meal, there was no way I was eating their food ever again!\n\nAs I said before, I hate deducting stars from a place I love so much but if them giving me wheat pasta wasn't bad enough they showed little to no remorse to a VERY FREQUENT customer!!  Not cool!!  Not to mention even if  it didn't work out for me to eat there again and feel comfortable, I have a very hungry boyfriend whose always enjoyed the taste of their foodlll Until the truth of their personalities came out!\n\nUPDATE: This review has gone down to 1 star after being treated in such a POOR manner by the manager/owner.  He truly lost me as a customer when he said \"I only ordered this stuff for YOU POEOPLE.\"  And continued on stating that he would take if off if he could.  I have never thought the bigotry I would endure in life would be because of an illness which limits what I can eat!  Shame on this place!  I could have become seriously ill from their mistake and his only response was a chuckle saying, \"What, am I supposed to sign off on all Gluten-Free items that leave the kitchen?\"  No Jackhole, you are supposed to educate your staff when you take on the responsibility of serving a very large community of people who are doing this not by choice but for survival!"

It's a bit pricy for the amount of food you get if you're comparing it to a place in the Chi but for Vegas portions it's plenty of food.  They get thumbs up for the Italian beef sandwich that I got dipped with hot peppers as well. Light on the portions but decent flavor."

I was born and raised in Chicago, and in the 9 years I've lived in Vegas, I've done a lot of complaining about the absence of a good Chicago pizza joint.  But NO MORE!  This place is it!  I'm always greeted and treated like family.  Everyone in there is extremely hospitable, and the service is impeccable.  Plus, the place is always filled with actual Chicago natives....so you know it's the real deal!  I've had both the deep dish and the thin crust, and they nailed 'em both!  The atmosphere is very lively and relaxed.  You'll even find the owner mingling with the guests and chatting about back home.  I recommend this place to everyone.  In fact, I'll be bringing a bunch of my friends there to show them what Chicago pizza is really all about!"

The restaurant has a really nice ambience, tons of Chicago memorabilia over the walls. It makes you feel like you're in the city. \n\nOur waitress Jennifer was awesome, our drink order was immediately taken. Soon after we ordered our appetizers, mozzarella sticks and a side salad, both were delicious. The small side salad was enough for two people to share. We ordered a pepperoni and sausage deep dish pizza- amaaaaaaazing. It was so big (even though we ordered a medium) we were stuffed after a couple of slices and had to take it to go. I can go on and on about how great this place was but the best advice I can give is try it out. You will NOT be disappointed!"

Anyway, we got there right when it opened, she had to unlock the door for us. She offered us to sit anywhere we like and I chose the window side with the Planet Hollywood table. (Each table has a different photo of the Las Vegas strip... It's thuper cute!) I love the decor inside, different sports memories plastered on the walls. \n\nShe got our drinks quickly, took our order and the food came out shortly after that. It's important when you only have an hour for lunch. My coworkers each had a sandwich and I chose the stuffed shells.(sadly I was so hungry I didn't get a picture :) There were 4 decent sized shells covered in sauce and LOTS of melted cheese. It also came with a side of bread which was slightly crunchy on the outside and thuper soft on the inside. ---very important! I woofed down 3 shells and most of my bread in a matter of minutes. That means it was delicious and no, nobody was trying to take my food away. \n\nOverall we had an amazing lunch and I can't wait to come back with the hubby this time. I know he was bummed I went without him. :/"

Without going into unnecessary details...I am just not sure if it was the pizza in it's entirety or the chicken that has made me sick.

I'm rarely in the mood for pizza, but it sounded great today. \n\nWe were gravitating towards a white pizza, but the lady helping us sold us on how good the deep dish is that we decided we can wait the 45 minutes for one (if you know that's what you want- call it in and drive on over there so you're not sitting there forever) , talk and nosh on a app.\n\n She told us about different specials not on the menu so we took up the special large deepdish with 2 toppings at $15 and some change instead of it's normal price (I believe about $22). We got ours with spinach and beef....think of it like a pizza lasagna!  If your server doesn't tell you ask specials- ask because she named off a few. \n\nThe BF was feeling the fried zucchini ($6.95) for our app and I like that it was thin slices so you get a lot of crumb crust. I normally dip in ranch, but that marinara was off the hook so fo'getta abou' ranch! Our server brought us hot bread and though I love me some balsamic and oil, I sopped the rest of the marinara up. \n\nOnce it came, I was so hungry, yet I only ate 1 and 1/4 a slice. It hits like a brick! The crust is consistently crunchy throughout and the fillings are all quality. \n\nWe heard our lady chatting with the table behind me and they were talking about Chicago and where they grew up to see if they were neighbors or something so you know that they're definitely legit people here too. She was very sweet, checked on us often and we never had to ask for a drink refill.\n\nI'm not much for a pizza person, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely I think if I have a hankering for pizza again, I'll keep this place on the short list!"

And it didn't let us down. :-)\nWe had the deep dish cheese with extra cheese, and we should have paid attention to the number of people it serves. We ordered a large, because we love pizza, and could only finish about a quarter of it. The thing must have weighed 10 pounds! A very dangerous meal, since you know you should stop eating it, but it tastes so good you just have to have another bite,and another, and another...you get the picture. :-)\n\nSince it was an estimated 25 minutes for the pizza to cook, we decided to have an appetizer. That was the first mistake of our visit. We had the eight piece serving of fried mozzarella triangles. The mistake was not because the mozzarella triangles were not good, they were very good, but they took up more space in the tummy that the pizza could've filled. \n\nAll leftovers were nicely packed up in containers for us to bring back to the hotel. Good thing we had a refrigerator in the room :-) \n\nThe restaurant has a sports atmosphere, clean tables, a lot of sports pictures around the room. Very 50s diner type atmosphere :-)\n\nWe were staying on the strip, so I would recommend visiting Amore if you're renting a car. We actually rented a car for a day (5/1/14) just to make the trip to Amore. The cab fare alone would have been more than the car rental, and that's not including the tip. (According to a web site that estimates cab fares, it was a $60 round trip fare from the Mirage hotel.)\nWill definitely do it again on our next visit back to Vegas :-)"

They always tell me that the wait time will be 45 minutes, but it ends up being about 25-30 minutes. The one thing that annoys me about the employees who take the phone orders is that they never tell me what my total is before asking for my payment. Seriously! I give them my order. Then they ask, \"How will you be paying? Cash or Credit Card?\" I ALWAYS have to ask them, \"Uh, what is my total?\" I mean that is common sense, right? They should always tell their customers what their total is BEFORE asking for payment!!\n\nI haven't tried too many items on their menu, but this is what I like so far:\n\n-BBQ Baby Back Ribs: I have definitely had better, but these ribs were still pretty good. I usually get this if I am really hungry since it also comes with beans, fries and cornbread. \n\n-Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza: full of flavor and very filling for a thin crust pizza.\n\n-Deep Dish Pizza (with Pepperoni, Sausage and Olives): Our party ordered this earlier this week and it was the first time I had actually dined in the restaurant. I rarely eat Deep Dish Pizza, but this was pretty good and made me full very fast! They cut the slices so big that I was full after eating just one slice!\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n-Homemade Fried Mozzarella: not sure how to explain this one. I guess I was expecting it to taste like the Mozzarella Sticks you would normally order from other restaurants, but it tasted funny.\n\n-All the Pasta dishes I have tried: maybe it was because I ordered it for delivery or on bad days. Their cream sauce for the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo was too thick and lacked taste. I also felt that their marinara sauce was a bit too sweet. \n\nPrices are kind of high, but overall the food is pretty good."

While watching the UFC 196 fight night we decided to order a pizza and not just any pizza, forget about Domino`s, Pizza hut, etc. So we ordered from Poppa Joe (Amore Taste Chicago). It was a simple order a medium pie 1/2 cheese & 1/2 Canadian bacon, and garlic, simple right? I go to pick up the pie get home and open the box and see what appears to be a plain cheese pie.\n\nI called back and told the young girl that I believe the wrong pie was given to me. She asked me to bring it back and she would make me another pie, ok I have to go back again and the main event of the fight is just starting, so I rush back to the restaurant to exchange the botched order. There in front of me is this young girl who takes the pie opens the box and say`s what`s the problem with the pizza, I simply asked where`s the Canadian bacon, she then grabbed a tooth pick and started to lift the cheese and literally found about 6-8 pieces of Canadian bacon and no garlic.\n\nShe then said that this is the right pie and stated to me that if I wanted to exchange it she would have to charge me. Needless to say I was at a loss for words and could not believe what I was hearing. I will not order another thing from this place after the experience that I had. I don`t know if Poppa Joe reads thes reviews or doesn't care but I have been going there sometime`s for lunch or ordering for pick up since 2008. This is sad because coming from Chicago I support my hometown people. It looks like Rosatti`s will get all of my future orders.\nSo long Poppa Joe."

How do you know it's Chicago Style? You can pull a slice out with a pie slicer, and the crust is firm, and the inside stays all in one piece, with little dangly mozzer-elactites. Like a blueberry pie...made of meat. \n\nThese are not just people claiming \"yeah it's a heavy crust so we call it 'Chicago Style'  and hope no one notices.\" This is not a wet gooey mess of sauce and toppings on bread. This is actually Chicago style deep dish, at it's best. Better than Giordannos in Chicago proper, if you ask me.\n\nIn Chicago, I'd give it 4 stars, since it's not Lou Malnatti's. Here? Oh heck yeah it gets 5 stars here.\n\nPros:\n- Name of Restaurant Not a Dirty Filthy Lie. This is what Actual Chicago Style Pizza tastes like.\n- Good food, good prices\n- They deliver, and it's fast for chicago style. (allow 45 minutes for cook time)\n\nCons;\n- Allow 45 minutes for cook time."

The only thing close we can get in our little corner of Arizona is the pizza we make at home.  And I haven't perfected the crust yet.\n\nThe pictures in Yelp looked right (sauce on top, depth of crust, etc) so we decided to give it a try despite some mixed reviews on service.\n\nWe ordered via GrubHub, because that's actually what the Amore website recommended.  Staying at the MGM grand, pretty far from the restaurant, they delivered for a reasonable fee and got the order perfectly right.  \n\nWe included our floor and room number, and the delivery guy arrived promptly (well, the deep dish takes 45 mins to make so he arrived when expected, with delivery time after that).  He brought the pizza directly to our room without any delays calling or trying to find us.\n\nOur only small complaint is that they did not bring any forks or plates and it was a little hard to eat without them.  Grubhub actually has a spot to select NOT bringing those things, so we didn't think to request them.\n\nAll in all, the pepperoni and in-house sausage was excellent.  The sausage definitely tasted premium, and you could believe it was homemade.   The crust was buttery and well-cooked, but was a little harder at the edges than we'd like by the time we sat down to eat.  I'm sure it would have been better eating in the restaurant, but I think that's always true of delivery.\n\n I got the cannoli because, as an Italian American, I miss them.  We don't get them in the southwest made the \"right way\" very often.  And this was definitely excellent homemade cannoli.  The only ones I've gotten recently have been previously frozen, and the pastry is not as crisp and delicate as the ones Amore makes.  This was the perfect pastry, the filling was not too sweet, and the dusting of powdered sugar perfectly tied the two together.\n\nI'm impressed.  I didn't have nearly the trouble with service as some other reviewers, in fact I actually called the restaurant to ask what the most efficient way to get the pizza from the delivery guy would be (if he wanted me to come down to the lobby, i would have) and the nice girl who answered assured me with the room number I provided, he'd find me.  I was skeptical, I mean after all the lukewarm reviews, was he really going to find my room?  He did.  he didn't need to call, he was quick and courteous... and we were able to dig in."

After working in Chicago for a lengthy amount of time and trying every pizza joint under the sun, Amore is OK, but not a worthy rave. The crust is buttery and overly sweet, kind of reminiscent of Gino's East. If you looking for a Giordano's/Lou Malnati's flavor, check out Rosati's or Maciano's...their sauces are a little more on the spicy side (read: more flavorful) and their crusts are not sweet so it doesn't seem like you're eating a pastry covered with sauce and cheese. \n\nThe place is cute inside and service very quick and friendly. I will be back to try a beef sandwich though!!!!"

The new king of pizza in Vegas is Amore!\n\nAfter stumbling upon one of their ads in the local paper, I immediately drove out and had to try this pizza which looked so delicious. My roommate and I ordered the deep dish pepperoni, and the mozzarella \"sticks.\" \n\nThe fried mozzarella was something I've never had before, and was blown away by it. Not your average run of the mill fried mozzarella. It is fried to perfection, and the sweet marinara compliments the rich taste perfectly.\n\nNow the pizza, since that first time, I've been to Amore a half dozen times more. It's that good! I thought it was on the expensive side, but I quickly realize it is well worth it. The sauce is sweet just how I like it, you can just taste the freshness of the crushed tomatoes. The amount of cheese is perfect, not overbearing. But the main attraction for me is the crust. It is soft, buttery, flaky goodness. When you bite into it, the flavors just explodes in your mouth. The food is so good I'm catatonic after every meal at Amores! \n\nI'm salivating as I type this review. Go to Amores!"

Never in my life have I actually experienced cheese hanging off the pizza after I take my slice. The ingredients they use must be fresh or they get the good stuff because you can taste the quality. It's pricey for a pizza but it's worth it. The pizza takes awhile to make but it's worth the wait and having pretty girls to look at isn't bad either. It is just overall great pizza. It's like cheese, bread, pepperoni and tomato sauce all had an orgy and some how they all got pregnant, fused and made one big baby, then I come along and I eat their delicious pizza baby and bite into it and have all their delicious orgasmic flavors in my mouth, but it doesn't make me gay because the pizza was a girl, that's how damn good it is."

It is always disappointing when you give your business to an establishment and they prove that they are actually not concerned with delivering good service. The employee did offer a lame \"it must be on its way\" as an excuse; really? one hour and 15 minutes to deliver GARLIC BREAD? Now, it isn't the money; it was garlic bread, only $4. It is simply a case of don't promise a service if you aren't able or willing to follow through. Sadly, the rest of the food was good; too bad I will not be ordering from them again. FYI GrubHub refunded the $4, so great, thanks GrubHub for standing by your service when the restaurant wouldn't. Trying hard not to sound petty over garlic bread; again, it isn't the money at issue, its the lack of follow through to make something right."

My friend and I visited in mid-afternoon on a weekday. My friend was disappointed they don't serve alcohol; he likes a glass of wine with his pizza; it's something I never think to ask about. We both ordered a medium stuffed pizza, intending to take most of it home for meals over the next few days.  About 45 minutes later, our pies arrived. Both were the overstuffed delights like we had previously experienced, and we both have 3 days worth of meals packed in our refrigerators. I have some minor quibbles, so I'll address them here. First of all, they were out of mushrooms. How do you run out of mushrooms? So, no mushrooms on my pizza. The sauce was fine; we both agreed we liked it all right, but there was something about it that made us think it was not quite as good as what we'd had before. I ordered pepperoni and \"homemade sausage\" on my pie, and the sausage flavor was completely overpowered by the pepperoni. Next time I'll skip the pepperoni if I want to taste the sausage. Finally, part of the reason we visited the restaurant is that they did not deliver to our locations; we would have needed to use a 3rd party delivery service. In conclusion, I'll likely get pizza here again next time I'm in Las Vegas. Please don't close!"

Avoid this place like the plague, as a Chicagoan, I can honestly say, no self respecting Chicago eatery would ever treat a customer like this.\n\n\nEDIT: Food finally got here 9:30 .. food's cold, my soda is warm, the fries are soggy and the taste is just ok. Between the refund of my order and grubhub sending me coupons to make up for the horrible service, I was paid to eat here, and still feel like I overpayed."

The sauce on the pizza was so bland and had no flavor. The deep dish we had wasn't even edible, it was dry hardly any sauce and no flavor.  You will never find as good as  Lou Malnati's here but this place isn't even close.  Sorry Amore's but you lost our business after 10 years.  Ever since the head chef Enzo left and all the the staff changes including our favorite waitress Rosemarie not there anymore, the food went down hill too.  We went to Rosati's on Hulapai by Town Center and Wow it tasted just like Giordiano's.  Once you have their pizza you will never go back to Amore's.  Its very delicious, taste just like back home again."

The girl who answered the phone (who sounded like she has a 12 year old vocabulary and who has the personality of a stiff tree) told me that because the pizza takes 30 minutes to make, she wouldn't be able to make me what i want or any other kind of pizza for that matter. Now i understand that the restaurant closes at 10pm and the employees wanna go home, but seriously! Come on now! Would it have really killed them to stay a measly 10 minutes passed closing to make a simple pizza if it means gaining a potential, long term customer??? Geez!!! It's not like I rolled up in there at 9:59pm asking for a pizza!!! That would be inconsiderate.  I usually eat pizza for lunch or for early dinner.....never really passed 7 or so so it's not like i would have made it a habit to go later. Also, I'm one who also works in customer service and i too have kids to go home to, but to stay a couple minutes longer once in a blue moon to make someone happy has never once bothered me or my family! Small businesses have way too much competition with other small business owners and definitely with bigger chain businesses like Little Caesars and Pizza Hut  (despite the fact that Amore is \"chicago style\" pizza) to be so damn petty about making a pizza a few minutes passed closing time! To be honest, it doesn't even taste like chicago style! It's somewhat close and it's not bad tasting, but it's still las vegas' version of chicago style! Smh!!!"

Not the all time best either though.\n\nI recently came to Amore while visiting family in Las Vegas and naturally I asked where the best beef sandwich was in town and Amore was the answer I got. So we stopped in around 1pm mid-week and it wasn't very crowded, but the place was clean and pleasant. The server was good, she refilled drinks several times and didn't leave us hanging for too long and she was friendly.  \n\nI ordered a beef sandwich with sweet peppers and a side of fries. Not that I'm an expert or anything, but I would say this was a good place to eat overall. The sandwich was good, the beef was clearly cooked right as well, however the fries left a bit to be desired. So I can't go as far as to call it the best I've ever had, because it isn't, but it is better than a lot of Chicago-style food places I've been to and they have good service and reasonable prices as well. \n\nThere appeared to be several cheap lunch specials and I could see just by looking around that they were pretty popular. Overall, my experience at Amore's was good. If I am back in vegas I may stop back in sometime again."

When the server took our orders she stated that the Chicago pizza would take 35 minutes just a tip for others to know if you are in a time crunch! This restaurant offers Pepsi products now I'm a Coca-Cola lover so if you are too they offer Coca-Coke in cans! This is definitely a place to bring your family of all ages.

Grandma took my boyfriend and I here for dinner. It was fairly quiet on a Saturday night with only a handful of tables occupied. All the ladies that were working were friendly. They greeted us with smiles and warm pleasantries. \n\nWe ordered the large deep dish, sausage on the whole thing and half with pepperoni. We also ordered a couple beef sandwiches, one with hot peppers and one with sweet peppers and cheese, and added fries (they do not come with the sandwich and are an additional charge). Luckily for us, the beef sandwiches came out quick, which was good because I was starving! The sandwiches were good, I enjoyed the hot gardinera on mine as well as the au jus that came on the side for dipping. The fries are nothing special, I would skip getting those next time. Finally our pizza came out, and it was good, and very filling. This is the type pizza that you eat with knife and fork, and I could only eat one piece and was stuffed. Even my boyfriend who has a hearty appetite could only eat 2 pieces. They did not skimp on the meats or cheese, but the crust was lacking flavor. It could use some type of sprucing up, maybe some seasoning or some melted butter. It just tasted bland. Also I wish the pizza had more sauce, I love that sweet sauce with the chunky tomatoes. Still, the price is fair and we had plenty leftover to eat for lunch the next day. Grandma said that she hadn't been here in about 2 years and probably wouldn't come back for another 2. I guess she didn't like it. Oh well, I would come back if I was in the area and craving deep dish pizza and friendly service."

First, the Chicken Angelo--the sauce was bland and unseasoned.  It is supposed to be a white wine and chicken base reduction with lemon.  It was almost tasteless.   2 stars.  The BBQ Chicken sandwich was fine, but there was a mystery side salad (about a cup and a half of chopped lettuce, chopped red onions and 3 tomato slices served without any dressing or dressing choice offered.  French fries portion was generous, crispy and hot..  3 stars.  My lasagna was puzzling.  The waitress indicated there was \"lots of cheese\", but I thought they skimped..  The top layer of cheese was mozzarella, and all the interior cheese was ricotta.  They advertise a meat sauce on the layers, but I had ricotta only, which made the lasagna fairly dry--not moist and gooey, like I am used to.  The lasagna was accompanied by two rather skimpy (I am guessing 2 ounce) meatballs on the side.   I have had, and I also make a whole lot better.  2 stars.  I would recommend doubling the meatballs--the cost would be only about 80-90 cents.\n\nAll 3 dishes arrived at the same time, however the consequence of this was that my wife's and son's dishes were piping hot, while my lasagna was just past warm only.  \n\nOne minor gripe.  When we got the bill after trying to catch the waitress's eye for about 3 or 4 minutes, the plastic folder stated \"We proudly accept American Express Cards\", which my wife put in for payment.  Our waitress took one look and informed us they no longer accept AMEX--handed the bill back and promptly scooted to another part of the restaurant.  Four minutes and 10 seconds later (finally---my chronograph watch does something useful !!l!), she returned to collect the check and credit card.  Another 3 and a half minutes and she returned with the bill for my wife to sign.  She managed to finish the night by hitting one of my pet peeves..  She started clearing the table while my wife was signing and while we were still seated.  After almost 9 min to check out, she couldn't have waited 30 more seconds for us to get up and leave???\n\nI am giving a rare (for me) 2 star rating."

The cashier said my order is ready,and instead of me checking it before I left wich is my fault. I should have checked it before I got  home. I called back I was put on hold for 10 minutes. I hung up called back,and asked to speak to the manager. She is no customer service savvy very young and rude.(Kenya) I told her. I got home and my pizza wasn't cooked all the way. it was doughey and raw. I also mentioned There wasn't hardly any sausage on it. for $22 and some change they can stick it. I also ordred some friend zucchini. wich were soggy. My brother told me to write this review too. lol. They SUCK!!!! I posted pictures so you can see the dough. I even put it in my own oven for another 28 minutes on 400 degrees,,,,,and it still wasn't cooked all the way. I wound up throwing this crap in the trash!!!! I will never ever be back. and to be honest I see why the place was empty too. Also when your running a CHICAGO establishment. don't have your employees wearing Carolina wear in your restraunt, to me that isn't professional supporting another team!!!"

Perhaps one of us had a random Chicago craving while in the Vegas area - as if quality Chicago-style food was knowingly easily accessible. Who knew that Vegas actually had a place that would cater to such need? Not I!  Thanks to Yelp, we made the trek here from the Vegas strip to grab italian beef sandwiches. The quality of meat was actually better than the average sandwich you normally get outside of Chicago. With the giardinera, it actually tasted rather authentic. The fries were hot and fresh - just how I like em! The service here was pretty good as well even though we were only three of about six patrons at the restaurant.  Most people who came in were ordering pizzas which makes me curious about how good those are. All in all, I wouldn't mind coming back here if I was actually in the area... Good stuff!"

But on a serious note - we were seated right away, but then were not approached again until about five minutes later when someone finally took our drink order. Now, I may just have high standards,.. but it shouldn't take more than a couple minutes to get 3 waters and 1 coke - especially in a restaurant where only about 3 or 4 other tables were occupied, and where there were at least 3 different servers. And once our food was given to us, we were not approached by anyone again. \n\nNow, I'm on a mission to find the best Italian Beef and/or sausage in Vegas. Who doesn't love moist, tender beef and tasty, grilled sausage on good bread, with some Au jus? Apparently - Amore Taste of Chicago doesn't. Because the crap they served us was dry and tasteless. And the only flavor the Au jus had was salt. \n\nThis place does seem to have good reviews for their pizza, so I might give it a chance one day. But, I'll definitely be taking it as a To-Go order."

The sauce was rather plain and some of the pieces ( corner ) did not have much coverage but overall the taste was good.\n\nReally nice view of the strip if you sit by the window.

So--dear eaters--I sincerely apologize for not listening to you Chicago deep dish lovers.  I was so wrong.\n\nAmore is one of those pizza joints that you pass by while driving home, but never take the time to stop in.  Since I'm a bit adventurous at the moment, I decided to cancel my mail order deep dish from Chicago (from Lou Malnati's) and take my mother here for some Italian.  There are two reasons I chose this place out of all places in Vegas - 1) the reviews are oustanding, and 2) the chicago deep dish pizza.  \n\nWhen you first walk in, you see a casual eatery; the usual metal chairs and chicago-dressed 4 top tables fill the seating area.  There's sports memorabilia on counters, and posters on walls. But forget the decor--the scent of cheese and pasta should get you excited when you walk in the door.\n\nThe staff is friendly and will tell you what is best when you ask.  I trust the staffers, since they eat the food for lunch daily.  The consensus? - Ribs, deep dish, and lasagna.  The girls say that the ingredients are from home (Chicago), so it tastes just as good, if not better.  It takes 45 minutes for a deep dish'er, but trust me--it is worth the wait.\n\nThe appetizer list is short and sweet.  We went for the usual fare--some breaded mushrooms with ranch dressing.  Their breading is well seasoned, crispy and isn't oily at all.  There were no grease stains on the plate even after sitting for a few minutes.  The lasagna is creamy, layered with sliced sausage and ricotta and dressed with a fresh tomato sauce that is so darn good.  I like the sliced sausage or meatballs in the lasagna and LOVE the cheesiness.  The sauce, with it's tangy kick balances the sausage and  cheese out well.  The ribs are melt-in-your-mouth tender and they aren't slathered in sauce, which I appreciate.  It's sweet and smoky with a bit of spice and tang.  Served with lots of fries and some beans, it's a big boy dinner.\n\nThe star of the night was the deep dish pie we ordered.  The first time I laid my eyes on it I was excited to see the crust uneven.  The sauce is fresh and the cheese, decadent.  The first slice came up with the spatula followed by a strings of cheese, almost endless as I placed the first slice on my plate.  This is not your pick up and eat pizza; this requires a fork and knife.  The crust is flaky and buttery, well seasoned and so much fun to eat.  The cheese is creamy and unending, the sauce tangy but sweet, and the pepperoni crispy and gives just the right amount of saltiness to the dish.  The best part--the spicy kick in their sauce.  It's subtle, but there.  I ate half the pie, savored every bit of the crust, and wiped my plate with it to catch all the leftover cheese and gobs of sauce.  I did it all in complete silence and focus, mind you, finally coming up to breathe once I had my fill.  \n\nThis joint is a great stop on anyone's Yelp to-try list. I have to admit that I wasn't thrilled at first to try a deep dish pizza, but once I saw it was love at first sight, and marriage by the first bite.  You cannot beat great pizza, let alone great deep dish, and this place takes the pie."

I'm a New York thin crust type - so I've eaten at Amore's twice (once for lunch and once for dinner) and still think it's one of the best at delivering traditional Italian staples.\n\nBetween my friends and I we've had: Chicken Parmigiana, Chicken Francese, Homemade Lasagna, Chicken Alfredo and everyone of us would rather eat here than in any other local Italian restaurant. The only disappointment was with an appetizer - the Caprese Salad, which tasted great, but was quite skimpy on the buffalo mozzarella - and who needs cucumbers in a Caprese Salad?\n\nDinners run $14 - $18. Pizzas start at $9.25 for a small cheese, and go up to $24 for 16\" \"everything\" and specialty combo pizzas/\n\nThere are still many dishes I'm looking forward to: surprisingly, Baby Back Ribs are a specialty, and also at a special price on Wednesdays. Chicken Piccata, Marsala, Cacciatore are all favorites of mine too. Portions are large, but the pasta with the meals is a smaller portion now than my first visit.

There were several TVs playing various Chicago games as well.\n\nAfter ordering a \"1/2 cheese & 1/2 Sausage Stuffed Pizza\" (large) priced at $19.50 our server told us that it would take about 45 minutes to make so I ordered \"Cheesy Garlic Bread\" priced at $3.95 to grub on while the pizza was made. The cheesy garlic bread tasted good, but average. While waiting for the pizza I observed a couple different things going on. There was some sort of celebration with he staff because they all gathered to eat a ice cream cake (didn't look like spumoni to me!) and then there was the couple who got engaged. Yep, after they finished eating, he pulled out a ring and proposed. I don't know if this was where they had a first date or what, but it was interesting! \n\nNow let me get to the pizza. When our server (friendly and courteous) brought it to the table I was very excited. It looked so good! This was one cheesy, saucy, good kind of mess! The sauce is very sweet, I actually liked it, but if you aren't a fan of sweet sauces you might not like it. I used a fork to get every last tomato off my plate. The crust is supposed to have a buttery flavor however I didn't taste that. It was more doughy tasting, but certainly edible. I am usually just a cheese pizza kind of girl, but next time I would get a couple toppings to help balance the amount of cheese in the pizza. There was something about the crust that was just not right though. Windy City still puts out the best Deep Dish in my opinion. my husband thought the pizza here was very good, but he also thinks Pizza Hut is good. Enough said. \n\nOut front they have benches if you want to eat outside. Besides pizza you can choose from different pastas, salads, sandwiches and dessert. Catering is available."

I only enjoy one other calamari in town and that's on the Las Vegas strip, the flavor here burst through your mouth with the perfect layering of breading that literally melts in your mouth. The salt content combined with the tenderness make it a cant pass dish on your next visit!! WOW!"

Service was great and it wasn't very crowded when we went around 2 PM on a Sunday. \n\nWe ordered the garlic cheesy bread which came with a side of marinara. I wish the garlic cheesy bread was more garlicky but everyone has their own preferences. My sister and her bf thought it was fine. Good thing we ordered the bread because the pizza did take about 30-40 minutes. \n\nWe ordered a medium deep dish pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and pineapple. When the pizza came out, we didn't see any pineapple and asked about it.... we didn't realize that for deep dish, they put some toppings (like our pineapple) underneath the cheese. Oops. The pizza was good, but the crust was very very hard. I've never had a deep dish pizza before, but I was expecting a soft crust. Also, the crust was a bit on the sweet side. I'm not sure if its because the pineapple was sweet and it seeped into the crust or what but I wasn't a big fan of the crust. There was a ton of cheese, and the pineapple was a very good addition to the pizza. \n\nOur total for 3 people came out to be around $26 before tip which wasn't bad at all considering we had about half the pizza left. I think an appetizer, a salad and a medium pizza would be more than enough for 3 people."

I like to think that a deep dish pizza should be more like a pie. You know, like a  ( pizza pie ) . The dough was perfect but the meat and cheese should've been layered a lot thicker . I'm going back to try the thin crust. Also the cheddar and bacon fries were delicious. It takes 35 mins to cooked the deep dish, so go online and see what kind of deep dish you want and order ahead if possible or you'll ruin your appetite on drinks and appetizers."

            "review": "I've eaten Amore Taste of Chicago pizza twice in the last month, due to a friend's recommendation. I would have to say that I was not disappointed based on the price and quality of food.\n\nUpon walking in the ambiance is similar to a deli style experience you'd expect. Very basic tables with a ton of celebrity decor on the walls (some relating to Chicago, some relating to Las Vegas and some I have no idea about concering the relation). \n\nNevertheless, the service was very prompt even for a lunchtime. We ordered the Fried Ravioli and a large deep dish Chicago Style pizza with pepperoni (which was about $20). However, please note that if you're very hungry order an appetizer as the deep dish pizza has a wait time of approximately 45 minutes. This fact is stated on the menu clearly which I appreciated. The fried ravioli was decent, not the best I've had - but not bad. It's also served with a small bowl of marinara sauce.\n\nWhen the pizza came out, I understood why it took 45 minutes to cook. It was probably about 6 pounds of dough, cheese and meat. The crust was buttery and flaky, the cheese was very gooey and liberally dispensed, the sauce was definitely made from actual stewed tomatoes and had a good taste and the pepperoni was nice and crispy. This was a lot of food. I was only able to eat one piece of this pizza and was definitely full. I also shared this pizza with two human garbage disposals that I've witnessed eat an inordinate amount of food in one sitting and they could only consume two pieces of this beast before they threw in the towel. We left with a box containing 3 large pieces of pizza.\n\nI would definitely recommend Amore Taste of Chicago for anyone looking for Chicago style pizza in Las Vegas. I'm sure Chicagoans would disagree with me for this (as would New Yorkers about a restaurant touting New York Style pizza in Las Vegas). But on the sliding scale of pizza places in Las Vegas, this one definitely comes out high in my opinion."

Awesome! So I was beginning to call the restaurant to inform them of their error when suddenly the phone rings...its Amore. I was thinking \"oh they must have left the white pizza on the counter and boxed up the wrong one\" but to my dismay, they are calling to request my credit card number again because they mistyped it into the computer! So I took that chance to explain the pizza situation to them and I was presented with two options...they can come out and replace the pizza (which will take a considerable amount of time...more than an hour) or I can receive an $8 credit of the difference for next time. They told me they could not void out the previous order and charge me the correct amount,therefore stealing my money by forcing me to make an additional purchase to receive my money owed. This was definitely a one-star experience, but I must give 2 stars on account of the quality of the pizza which was delicious. If they can make things right I'd be willing to update the review later, but I need to see improvement in your attention to detail and way in which you handle your errors."

We have had no luck until we decided to try this place.  Their large cheese pizza, extra well done with extra sauce tastes just like the pizza we love from back home.  It is just the right amount of thin (not too thin like NY Style) but not too think like regular pizza.  Also they cut the pizza into squares like the neighborhood joints do.  The best.  The pizza is slightly more expensive than it should be.  For example, we could get a 18\" pizza with 3 toppings for $16.00 from the north side of Chicago.  Not sure why this is a little more expensive.  But overall, best Chicago style pizza I've had in Las Vegas.  If it weren't so far from my home, I'd go again."

We ended up ordering a small pepperoni & sausage pizza and the Italian beef sandwich ...OMG!   This was the best pizza we have had in a very long time...and we're no stranger to pizza; the ingredients were fresh and plentiful, the sauce was sweet yet tangy and coated the crust just enough, the thin crust just thin enough ( i typically don't eat thin crust)...and of course the pizza was bubbling hot, it was delicious!\n\nThe Italian beef sandwich was tasty too, it was flavorful, full of meat and I appreciated a generous portion of really hot (temp) juice for dipping...I did think the gardinar peppers could have been chopped a bit more...not as chunky.  We spent less than $20.\n\nAs we were leaving I assume he was the owner Mike introduced himself to us and was telling us about other menu items...it was a good feeling to know we were valued as customers (this is becoming rare).\n\nWe live right around the corner and will definitely be returning!"

Loaded with lots of fresh tomatoes on top too. My only complaint was the crust was a little undercooked in some places and I hate raw dough. I did think it lacked some salt in the sauce and maybe the toppings could have been a little more seasoned.\n\nOrdered the Mediterranean salad and it was the worst part of the meal. Mostly containing the white hard parts of iceberg lettuce. You know, the stuff in the center you throw away!  The dressing was semi-sweet and bland. The whole thing tasted rubbery. Which led me to believe it was premade, dressed and stored in the fridge overnight. Unfortunately the salad was what killed the rating and the bland/raw crust pizza didn't make it 5 stars."

Not terrible but not exactly what I was expecting.\n\nI will give the French fries the benefit of the doubt since they were delivered but they were soggy and tasteless. \n\nThe absolute worst part of this order was the fried dough. Described as, what else given the name, fried dough with powder sugar and honey. I was expecting something like Greek loukamedes. HA! It was barely cooked spare pizza dough that appeared to have been fried in the same as oil as the French fries. Of the two I managed to choke down, the inside contained oil that definetly was not fresh. No powdered sugar on these...things...and what they were trying to pass for honey was brown, greasy, sugar water.\n\nBe warned before eating here."

Vodka sauce was strangely similar to spaghetti o's. \n\nToo expensive for the pizza parlor/cafeteria/sports bar feel of the place. \n\nNote: 5 or 6 large screen TVs on the walls for sports fans."

The only complaint (which is not a big deal really) is that one of the toppings was wrong. Requested sausage and \"real bacon\" and received sausage and pepperoni. Fianc\u00e9 wasn't upset with it though :) will definitely order from Amore again! Fast delivery too! Thanks!"

Next time we visit ATC I will try the deep dish though...who knows, they may change my mind. \n\nThe ordering and pick up went pretty smoothly. I do want to note, if you select CC or Cash, be sure to stick with your payment option. I guess I had selected cash so they would not accept my CC as a form of payment. I had to run over to the store to get cash back in order to pay ATC for my pizza. Kind of a hassle, but they explained that the order did not go through them and that they were unable to change the payment method. In hindsight, I'm now thinking that's pretty strange though. \n\nSo! To the pizza! The pizza was pretty good! Not the best pizza, but I will return to ATC. The thin crust still had a little softness to it (which I like). Some pizza joints can really crisp up their crust, so glad that I found a place that doesn't. The sauce was a little sweet for my taste, but not unbearably so. The amount of cheese they used was perfect... but having ordered double pepperoni, I noticed that it appeared like a \"regular\" amount of pepperoni. Not sure if that was a fluke or that is the norm. \n\nWe had also ordered a cheesy garlic bread starter. The garlic bread was pretty good, nothing extravagant. I do wish that they hadn't wrapped them on top of each other, the cheese kind of stuck everything together. It was more so like a cheesy garlic sandwich by the time we got home. \n\nAll in all, my experience having A Taste of Chicago's pizza was \"A-OK.\" If you've never had it, try it! It's definitely worth the try."

One time our pizza came with a missing slice. My boyfriend and I just looked puzzled because we were missing a piece. The waitress informed us that they accidentally dropped a slice on the floor and will give us a little discount for the missing piece. When the check came they actually waived off the ENTIRE pizza. How sweet is that?\n\nI've only had their deep dish twice and both times we had about half pizza left because its just so filling we could never finish it all. Still tasted good hours later when it was cold.\n\nParking is never a problem here. It's actually in a pretty dead plaza or at least every time I'm here there's almost no cars. \n\nTried their spaghetti once and regretted it. It just seemed really plain. Their fried mozzarella are really good though. \n\nCredit cards accepted!"

Knowing this was my first time in and with minimal appetizer description, I'd have liked the waitress to clarify this was what I was getting, unfortunately she wasn't the most astute and I wasn't on it either.  I tried ordering a side of pasta to go with my 4 shrimp and sauce but was told I couldn't order but a large plate of pasta to go with my appetizer. Hmmm... Overall, the flavor was okay.

Until I make another trip to Chicago for a pizza pilgrimage, \"The Malnati Classic\" is the only deep dish that future pies will be compared to in my book. \n\nThe restaurant is 20 minutes from my neighborhood, so we placed an order for a small, 10-inch deep dish pizza with extra cheese and sausage to be ready for us by the time we arrived -- the toppings chosen were the same as \"The Malnati Classic.\" So how was it? Average at best. Other Yelpers have noted how the sauce has a sweetness; ours was the opposite had a mild acidic flavor. My biggest criticisms were the pizza was served to us warm, and the crust was hard. I hate to say it, but the crust ruined the pizza. \n\nAmore's deep dish may not be comparable to Lou Malnati's, but I would return to try another one of their pies, perhaps a regular thin crust which I've heard is delicious."

And everyone was so nice about it.\n\nSo we get seated and ordered another Caesar salad at the table.

Expect mediocre service and waitresses who care more about eating their ice cream than taking your order..... Let alone the right order. The first time around we had to ask for refills on drinks and waited around to get our check processed while they were busy talking amongst themselves. We were the only people in the restaurant and we had to ask to be served. Doesn't make much sense to me. \n\nThis time around I gave them a second shot. Their spaghetti and meatball lunch special was yummy like the first time around but the thin crust pizza was good but not that good. We ordered pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage and ended up with pepperoni, mushrooms, and a massive amount of onions. The onions made the rest of the pizza taste like Dominos ( the boyfriend said this ). He really wanted to try their home made sausage on the pizza so we are still waiting. Other than that, the service was still lacking even though we were one of two tables in the restaurant. I would be disappointed but fool me once shame on you......fool me twice shame on me. \n\nAs far as recommending this place.... I would say make sure you come when a good waiter/waitress is here. I wouldn't know if they have one. But the food is worth it just as long as you want waitresses who is concerned more with their ice cream as your food dies in the window. /harsh. I know."

We finally made a date of it, and went!\n\nWhen we arrived, it was a pretty cool family-style table setting. Lots of cool decor on the walls, and fun atmosphere. I had made a reservation since it was Mother's Day, but they were not at all busy. Some large families in there celebrating mothas. \n\nNow to keep this semi-short, let me just tell you... My friend ordered the Italian Beef Sandwhich, plus we ordered a small deep dish pizza with sausage & pepperoni, and I had the Chicken Parm (original, I know). \n\nMy chic parm was above average. However, the server messed up my order though and brought me the wrong pasta even after we had a very clear conversation on which one I wanted, but she took care of it, within a NON-timely manner. Oh wait for it. \n\nMy friend ordered the Italian Beef said it was bland and left much to be desired. \n\nThe deep dish pizza on the other hand was amazing. Very good. It deserves a 5. \nMy parm deserves the 4. \n\nHere is where the 3 plays in. \n\nService. Should be a 1. This waitress who was a s blonde to the core, with all the stererotypes to back it up.... had 3 tables, a two top, us (another two top) and a 4 top who was already served. She took 20 min to finally come take our order. She would constantly disappear and as I said earlier, brought out the wrong order of pasta. And don't even THINK about refills of their pepsi products (gross) Then at the end, we were looking forward to trying a Cannoli. I have never had it before, and this ditz of a waitress shows up, drops off our check and walks away. \n\nRUDE!\n\nSo we then had to flag another waitress down and ask for the dessert. Talk about a waste of a good evening! What could have easily been a 5 star night, turned into 3 because the lack of care and attention the staff paid.  At least the food was decent. Sadly, due to lack of service, in a Service-driven town, I am in no rush to return.  \n\nThe Cannoli was good. I have since tried it at 2 other places (one being the M Buffet) , which in turn made me think the one I had here was average.  \n\nMy advise, try it for yourself, keep your expectations low, and maybe you will enjoy it more than we did. Focus on the food, the deep dish, yum. \n\nHey! That's better than me suggesting you avoid it all together, right?"

My whole car smelled like sausage the whole way home and I was so happy as memories of driving home with my Dad on a Saturday night with the bottom of the pizza burning my lap. I can't wait to go back if you miss or want to experience REAL Chicago food without going to Chicago I Defiantly recommend this place."

We got sat down pretty fast the place isn't to packed, we get a complimentary tomato rochetta which is nice. We're there for 15 minutes and no one has came to get our drinks or anything. Instead they're more worried about changing the channels and talking in the back. Its sad because we've been going there for 5+ years and it's never been bad, we always recommend amores to our friends too. The owner is usually there but he wasn't today which explains a lot. Hopefully we go back soon to actually get served."

Then I saw the sign for this place and asked my wife if she wanted to try something new. She agreed and we ended up here. I had high expectations since the last time I had Chicago deep dish was at a renowned establishment in Chicago's east end. So that is the standard I compared this place to. In the end, I must say I am impressed. I can't say it completely measured up, but it was great nonetheless. The staff was friendly and welcoming and the service was very good. I would recommend calling ahead if you plan to get a deep dish. They take 35 minutes to cook. So this place offers a call ahead service and you pie will be ready when you get there. We will definitely be back!"

We had to make it before Lou Malnati's closed. So, yes, I have lusted for deep dish. More recently, I have started to doubt the nutritional smarts of consuming an inch of cheese sitting on top of a buttery crust, but I know it can still be a delicious treat. And, Amore's is indeed just that. \n\nI can't say it is as perfect as Lou's - the sauce borders on too sweet, and the crust doesn't have the perfect buttery crisp chewiness; it is more doughy. However, the overall effect is still a delight to consume. We ordered garlic and sausage, and when mixed with the cheese and fresh, sweet tomato sauce, it was a nice little (or rather deep) symphony of flavors. It also reheats very well. (We made the mistake we always make of ordered a medium, when truly a small will do for 2.)\n\nIt definitely takes 45-minutes for them to prepare, so don't come for a quick bite. While waiting we noshed on the fried zucchini, and it too was a nice indulgence. Service was efficient despite their being some sort of restaurant drama unfolding. I loved the fact that Rosie told us straight up, \"Don't get tomatoes,\" when we first suggested that was one of the toppings we wanted. I appreciate honesty in service. It makes for a better meal. \n\nDeep dish!"

Amore serves up authentic Chicago-style pizza, which is what draws Lauren to this place on a regular basis.  She's also a fan of the staff, who were friendly and accommodating the night that Mike and I were there for the party.\n\nMike and I shared an order of cheesy garlic bread, which came with a side of marinara. The bread was toasty, the cheese gently melted: a nice appetizer. \n\nFor my entree, I chose Shrimp Diablo with crushed tomatoes and hot peppers on a bed of linguine. It's typically a pretty spicy dish, so I asked if they could tone it down for me. They agreed, and they delivered. It was still hot after a few bites built the spices up, but not nearly as much as it would have been. I adapted by repeatedly adding grated parm until the red sauce turned slightly orange. Strategic gulps of iced tea helped, too.  The sauce tasted fresh, and the linguine was al dente.\n\nThe only bothersome detail was the tails left on the shrimp. I know it looks better, but I hate it when restaurants do that, especially for hot dishes.  There's just no good way to remove the tails without burning yourself and/or making a big, saucy mess. \n\nMike, of course, decided on pepperoni pizza for his meal. This was no surprise. The man could live on pizza seven days a week; he loves it that much. He selected thin crust because we've been trying to cut down on carbs... or that's what we tell ourselves.  It was good.\n\nThe thick-crust pies were a sight to behold. They were huge and seemed to be packed full of meaty, cheesy, tomato-y goodness.  Here's a mushroom and sausage pie that Steve ordered.  Steve let me sample the crust, and it was delicious.  \n\n\nThere are not a lot of options for dessert, but that's okay.  You're probably too full from the main course to eat it anyway, or you should be.  Still, Mike couldn't resist ordering some cannoli.  He made it contingent on me sharing with him, and I agreed.  I didn't want to let him down.  Aren't I a good wife?\n\n\nHaving eaten two pieces of garlic bread and half the shrimp, I was no longer hungry, but I managed to have a couple of tastes of the cannoli.  It was yummy.  Sometimes, if they've pre-filled them and left them sitting, the shells can get soft.  This one was crisp, breaking off with a satisfying crunch beneath our forks.  The cream was rich but not overly so, and the sweetness was just right with the chocolate chips."

It's funny because the people next to us didn't like their thin crust either.  When asked if they wanted to take home their pizza, the couple just said, \"no thanks.  We didn't like it at all.\"\n\nThe deep dish was also a disappointment.   The crust is off.   It isn't as buttery as good Chicago deep dish pizza.   The sauce is very bland.   \n\nThey get two stars, because they have a wide menu, and they at least attempt deep dish pizza.  It isn't easy; the crust is different, and most customers don't understand that these pizzas take 35-40 minutes to cook.\n\nAfter reading the reviews, I toyed for a couple of days with ordering from here."

I called ahead for pick-up and was told my deep dish pizza would take 45 minutes - no problem, good things take time. I came to pick up my pizza and headed home. Granted, this is my fault for not looking at the pizza first, but once I got home, I realized they had given me a regular pizza, not the deep dish. I called back to let them know of their error, and the girl that answered was super apologetic and placed me on hold so she could get someone to remedy this situation. Instead of being helpful, the guy who picked up the phone basically told me I was in the wrong and there was no way they could have made a mistake and that I did not order the deep dish. I fired back with... if I didn't order deep dish, why did you tell me it would be a 45-minute wait for my food? That kind of quieted him down and he tried to back peddle and say although it wasn't their fault, they could make me another pizza. I didn't want to wait or have to be subject to in-person ridicule after driving back, so I said I would pass, but I wanted to make them aware of the issue. He rudely hung up. Granted, the pizza we did have was good and my husband really enjoyed the oily-ness of it all. For me, I can't support a place that accuses customers of wrongdoing so quickly and doesn't try to remedy the situation in a polite manner, so I won't be back. As Ty W. points out in his review though, it's probably worth at least one visit out here, buyer beware."

You'll get your money's worth if your just after a massive sheet of pizza and don't really care how great it is.\n\nThe crust had an extremely buttery taste, reminded me of store-brand canned biscuits...it was really flaky and not in an attractive texture sort of way. The bread was thicker than I like. I'm a big fan of Chicago style deep dish pizza, and this one just doesn't do it for me. I like that they make it fresh and serve it hot, but the flavor (sauce, cheese) just isn't what I'm used to.\n\nI did like the fried mozzarella appetizer we got, however. You can tell these are handmade, not store bought like I was expecting.\n\nThe restaurant could use some updating too.. But I guess it's not necessary since it's always full of people who seem to like it anyway.\n\nTry it for yourself.. You might enjoy it, but although I've only lived here a short time, I've already found a few other places with much better deep dish. So you know... It's out there."

Red, my favorite color. Jordan, the best basketball player EVER!!! Other Chicago memorabilia. Spacey with a lot of tables, chairs, and a couple big screen TVs.\n\nI can't review about their other items but I liked looking at the pics, they look good."

New Yorkers & Chicagoans love pizza.\n2. New Yorkers & Chicagoans love to talk about how terrible pizza is outside of New York & Chicago. \n\nWhen my sister was visiting from out of town and mentioned she wanted to give Chicago-style deep dish pizza a shot, I decided I'd rather forgo a long lecture of how the sacrament of pizza-making is lost in this city and just find a place with relatively decent reviews. I was feeling pretty YOLO-y that day, so Amore it was. \n\nThe joint is located in the same strip mall as Naked Fish, and the signage is old enough in Vegas years to be called vintage. Don't write it off yet just because the exterior is not at all spectacular. Walking in, it felt like a neighborhood, Cheers-esque kind of a pizza parlor where I imagine people would converge after football games if we could just do something about our damn Rebels. The fam bam and I ordered two medium stuffed pizzas - one with pineapple/bacon, and the other with sausage/mushroom. \n\n\"Deep dish\" and \"stuffed pizza\" were apparently two different options, but to be completely honest, I'm not sure still what the difference was because as far as I'm concerned, it's just A LOT OF CHEESE, whichever way you go. It was a \"deep dish of cheese.\" Or, \"stuffed with cheese.\" All I know is that if you are lactose intolerant, you are SOL here. The service was fast and friendly, though be forewarned - either of these pizzas generally take around 45min to bake. The crust was a little thinner than I expected, considering the motherlode of queso it was holding up, but other than that, this is the place for those that are looking to truly relish in the ultimate cheat day. Or looking to start their diet...tomorrow."

Menu states automatic gratuity on parties of 8 or more- there was 7 of us- not that we wouldn't tip the standard 20% anyways. The staff was very nice! 3 stars because I was super excited about the fried raviolis then disappointed when it was still frozen. Probably wouldn't make the 40 minute drive here again."

            "review": "The two stars are for lack of communication and in no way reflect on the fabulous food, that would be a five star. We have been customers since you opened and this review is for the OWNERS INFORMATION.A Co-worker gave my husband a $25 GIft Certificate and last night after a very busy day, we decided to use it. I called and ordered our usual to be delivered. The order taker did not identify herself and right away,I knew she was a newbie as she did not follow the standard protocol that you use for ordering. She asked card or cash and I said GC and cash. She said okay and gave me the total. Thirty minutes later it was at our door and I paid GC and cash as I HAVE DONE MANY TIMES BEFORE. We were just opening the order when the driver knocked on our door and said we don't take GC for delivery. Since when? Not his fault, so luckily, I had $25 in cash and gave it to the driver. What if I didn't have $25 in cash? Does the driver have a CC machine in his car? \nSince this has never happened, I called and asked to speak to the manager. Someone got on the phone, also not identifying herself and went into this long story about the order taker being new and not knowing about GC and that when the manager heard her say GC, she immediately told her to call us back and tell us they couldn't take the GC. I replied we never received that call. The manager says, she must have called the wrong number! Hmmmmmm, if that is the case, why send out the order right away? She told me that it has always been the policy to only take GC dine in. No where on the GC or Menu is that stated. She kept saying she was sorry, not very convincingly, but offered no solution or anything to make a long time customer smile.\nShe just wanted me off the phone. She said she would inform the owner, as I doubt that, that is the reason for the review. I have 35 years of experience in Customer Service in Retail and Food service. The manager needs extensive training on how to handle a complaint. I was easy, as I have been in her place, I never raised my voice or used inappropriate language. She did not listen to me or offer a solution. She should not have put a new person on the phone that was not properly trained without a trained person at her side and on a Friday night. This was order:7 on 9/11/2015 at 5:01PM. I will not post the name of the order taker as she is not to blame for lack of training and lack of communication from your establishment. For that reason, we are disappointed, but will return as Chicagoans, you have the best Chicago Pizza in Vegas!"
