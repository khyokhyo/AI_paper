Try their ume dressing for your cabbage. It's my favorite because it's light. \nSometimes they have Inaniwa udon and it's delicious, too.\nLast time I ordered tako sunomono, tako tested old and too much vinegar. So minus 1 star."

            "review": "Another local style restaurant near my house! I am loving the ninth island. Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is strictly all about the self described Tonkatsu. One of the many local kine food grew up on. Besides the fact always been fan of any kind of breading that uses panko. It done right nothing better then light crispy golden brown crust on the outside and juicy hot meat on the inside. At Tonkatsu Kiyoshi they do fabulous job comes too the Tonkatsu.\n\n It was my first time so on this visit only got too try the pork katsu although they have other proteins from shrimp, beef, and chicken. Most of the entree comes with rice, couple pieces of garlic (makes no sense, I never asked so sure has its compliment), and miso soup. The house miso soup was good. I liked the fact that it was on the hearty side with decent amount of diced tofu and seaweed. I heard about the Curry sauce from friend recommendation. So I got the Katsu Curry try the best of both worlds. Japanese Curry reminded me of the curry houses back home in Hawaii. Especially the fact that in curry comes with big diced cuts of potatoes and carrots. Think traditional Japanese style just the curry then you add extra items or other curry places around town that just the norm. I have no problem with just pointing out difference. The curry sauce base its solid. Other places around town the base curry is better but here curry sauce does have its flavor all its own. Its more darker in depth not more on the yellow/orange color use too. The tonkatsu was ON point crispy golden brown and hot moist on the inside. Portion size is LOCAL style. Very reasonable price too. One plate between half filled with rice, nice size portion of katsu, and my case curry sauce. Miso soup that full full lunch. \n\nIt small restaurant easily hold under hundred peeps. I like the bar action up front holds around ten seats. They have tables on both sides up front. The decor is simple couple of japanese art work on the walls. It just open so for sure has that brand new restaurant smell too it. Couple other business around it that not quite open yet so don't let the lack of action around mislead you. It tucked in the back of mini shopping mall so easy pass it. Open for both lunch and dinner. Sure plan on coming back trying more of the menu items."

Their chicken katsu was so flaky and not overly breaded that it literally made my mouth water! During my visit, we had the seaweed salad - Bomb, the chicken katsu with rice - bomb, the chicken curry - bomb dot com and the potato corn karroke - deep friend bomb. overall when i go back to Vegas, I would definitely stop by here again if you are looking for a quick fix for a good price! great job Tonkatsu Kiyoshi!\n\n\nPros: \nfast service and delivery through apps\ngreat customer service and attentive wait staff\nfood is delicious and price is reasonable\n\ncons: \nparking outside sucks\nsmall inside with tables that seat 4 comfortably"

Then went with the hire tonkatsu, was a huge portion and again i was surprised out how crispy the breading stayed.

            "review": "This is one of my favorite places we've discovered since moving to Las Vegas. The Katsu Curry is the perfect meal for a chilly day. And Las Vegas has been really chilly lately! It's a generous portion of beautifully fried (Yes, Japanese food can be beautiful even if it's fried. Educate yourself and rent these movies - Jiro Dreams of Sushi, The Ramen Girl, and Tampopo) pork tenderloin with a delicious curry sauce with chunks of potato and carrot over white rice. You also get a bowl of miso soup. It's the perfect hearty meal that will warm you up and leave your tummy so satisfied. If my tummy could talk it would tell me how happy it is. Having traveled to Japan twice and eating my way through the country, I'll vouch that the Katsu Curry is just like in Japan. It's one of those menu items that is so good that you order it every time. One of these days I'll have to force myself to try something else on the menu to mix it up. The service is very nice and the restaurant is very clean and neat. The times we've been there, we noticed Japanese patrons - always a good sign at a Japanese restaurant! They have highchairs for the kiddies. They have Calpico on their beverage menu which is fun. It's a popular Japanese soft drink. Want to finish off your meal with something sweet? Get a scoop of red bean or green tea ice cream for dessert. I LOVE this place and it is a perfect 5 stars for me.\nFor those of you from NYC, I think the Katsu Curry here is way better than at Curry-Ya on East 10th Street."

Ordered in a couple minutes and got the food within 10. \n- Best part, unlimited katsu sauce! McDs should take notes! haha charging extra for McNuggets dip. shame. HA! \n- Katsu was pretty good. crispy. Chicken better pork here. \n- Huge pieces of shrimp katsu! My favorite! \n- Loved the pickled scallions. But 2 though....tease\n- Shredded cabbage. Yum.\n- Curry was very good. Few pieces of carrots and potato. Sorta better than Kaba Curry, but it would be cool if you can order their curry spicier. Slap a fried egg on top.\n- For better Katsu in Vegas, go to Yu-Yu for lunch! Better soup! No miso. And their pestle looks like bark from a tree! haha, even more authentic. I think it starts at $9. \n- For SoCal-ers, Meh, Yoko and Katsuko in Buena Park is better and cheaper. Usually $9 and you get udon with side banchan. You'd think this place is pretty steep. Over 30 for katsu here! What. haha. \n- Aside from all that, this place is fantastic and will definitely come back for more but during dinner time."

            "review": "Being Japanese I have a natural craving to eat amazing Japanese food! It's rare to find something so good that rivals even the best in Japan! But I must say this tonkastu is one of the best I've had in a long time! The Hire Katsu (thinner cut of pork) and Rosu Kastu (thicker cut of pork) are both prepared perfectly with just the right amount of panko breading and very tender.\n\nIf it's your first time visiting this place, I would recommend the Hire over the Rosu Katsu as most of you will probably enjoy a thinner pork cut. The shrimp Kastu is a must! I wouldn't be suprised if these were more tiger prawns than typical jumbo shrimp as they are huge! Good thing they have a Hire & Shrimp Katsu combo ($15.00).  \n\nAs far as the Chicken Katsu goes, I'd give it a 3.5/5 so I wouldn't recommend trying this on your first trip. \n\nAll in all, I give this place a 4/5. Amazing Kastu but it's can be a bit pricey. Happy Eating Folks!"

The curry wasn't overly salty, just the right consistency, and makes for great leftovers with rice. We all ordered katsu curry but still asked for bowls to make our own tonkatsu sauce, which was pretty fun and aromatic. \n\nThe free potato salad you get for checking in is great as well! Not too much mayo, and refreshing with bits of apple.\n\nDefinitely would come back if I'm in the Vegas area."

It's located off the corner behind sporting life bar so not very noticeable from the street but this quaint restaurant was a definite find. \n\nThe employees right off the bat were welcoming, friendly, full of smiles and so courteous. Kinda felt home like, we were seated right away and greeted soon after. We went during lunch so there were a good amount of customers. \n\nWe enjoyed quite a few dishes. Excuse me for I am not sure of the names they are called on the menu but I'll do my best. We shared a chicken katau meal, which is quite a large portion. We enjoyed the soft shell crab with tgis amazing ponzu sauce, octupus & cucumber salad, fried squid legs and these octopus cream type balls (no clue what it's called). Everything was so good and quite filling. They were all served fresh and hot and quickly too. \n\nCutest thing is you get to make your own katau sauce. You grind the seseame yourself and then add the sauce. Different right? I like different. \n\nI'll be back for sure!"

            "review": "Hire Katsu and Ebi Fry Katsu Dinner ($16): Pork Tenderloin Katsu and Black Tiger Shrimp Katsu with rice, cabbage, Japanese pickles, and miso soup. A traditional Katsu meal with all the fixings. There are sesame seeds that you can grind and add to your dish and/or sauce. Katsu sauce is also available at the table. The best thing about their Katsu is that it's not greasy. It helps that it sits on a mini rack elevated on the plate. The pork was tender and the shrimp was plump and scrumptious. All around fantastic Katsu! I would have liked more and/or different pickled vegetables since my meal came with three pickled garlic bulbs.\n\nKatsu Donburi ($11): Pork Loin Katsu rice bowl with fried egg and dashi. Delicious!! I haven't had very many Donburi, but I imagine as long as the rice, toppings, and dashi broth is good, you're set. Again, great Katsu and the dashi was flavorful. I loved the addition of sunny side-up egg!\n\nArabiki Sausage ($5): Saut\u00e9ed Japanese sausages. Great flavor and easy to eat. Accompanied by hot mustard.\n\nWonderful spot for all your Katsu needs. Make sure to check out the Specials on the wall. We're definitely heading back to try their other dishes!"

She made me feel like I was bothering her. After taking my order, she did not thank me or even say good bye. She simply hung up on me. I was so upset that I ended up not picking up my order. Foolishly I thought maybe she was having a bad day, and decided to give this place another chance. We went for dinner while they were full and waited a few minutes for a table to open up. Once a table left, we started to walk towards it and the same waitress (I recognized her voice) yelled \"Can you wait so I can clear the table\" from across the restaurant (while rolling her eyes). We weren't planning on sitting, we just wanted to stand next to it in case another party walked in. And even if we were about to sit, you should NEVER yell at your customers, let alone from across the room. I believe this is a small family-runned restaurant and maybe she's just there because of her family, but she should probably be working in the kitchen instead of with customers. She obviously doesn't know anything about customer service or perhaps just doesn't care. She seemed irritable as I observed her dealing with other tables as weIl. I find it disappointing that the owner is ok with her treating customers so poorly. He obviously does not care about his restaurant or surviving in this competitive town, which is sad because I love supporting small businesses. I can honestly say I've never been so upset about restaurant service in my entire life. \nAs for the food- overpriced. Especially the apps. Rice is usually mushy. You can get better elsewhere."

            "review": "There are generally two kinds of tonkatsu. The kind you find in Japan, which is akin to eating fine dining meat--tender and juicy. And the kind you find in fast food joints in America, which tastes like fried cardboard doused in sweet sauce.\nTonkatsu Kiyoshi is of the first variety. Succulent, perfectly cooked morsels of pork, chicken or salmon. Here, you get authentic Japanese tonkatsu, but in Las Vegas, NV, of all places! And in a nondescript mini mall out in the suburbs. \nThe portions are large, with delicious white rice, miso soup, pickled onions, salad, and a nice dollop of potent mustard to accompany the table-ground sesame seed tonkatsu sauce.\nI have eaten at this restaurant at least 15 times and I often take out-of-town guests. It never disappoints. \nKiyoshi, the original owner and chef, recently left for a new opportunity. Let's hope that the new crew maintains the same level of service and quality."

It is always cooked perfectly and the portions are large. \nI have also had the Salmon and Shrimp Katsu, Chicken Katsu, and Thick cut pork Katsu. All done and cooked masterfully with the right amount of crispiness on the outside and juiciness still retained in the meat. \nThe appetizers also very delectable and not too over sized, which I personally like.

I went with my mom to try this place out because my mom is always down to eat Korean or Japanese food with me, so why not right? I heard about this place from some other yelpers and I was not disappointed! \n\nOne thing I saw pictures of was grinding your own sesame seeds and putting in your sauce or something, so I was curious. What you do is grab a bowl, put in some sesame seeds, and you grind it yourself! You can grind it to the consistency of your desire and I thought this was a fun little activity to do while we waited for our food. \n\nI ordered some karaage with my mom, and surprisingly, it was not greasy or too oily, it was actually really good. The outside was really crispy and the inside was soft. This is a highly recommended appetizer! When our actual entrees came out, it comes with the meat you ordered, rice, soup, and a salad. I ordered the pork and I don't remember the name of it because there were two pork katsu items with different names... But they are the same thing, that's what the server told me. I was confused and so I ended up getting whatever that was. My mom got the chicken and my mom got double the meat I did it seemed, for a dollar less. Nothing to complain about there, just get the chicken next time! Like saw their combos, but from the pictures, I didn't think the extra piece of shrimp was worth the 5 bucks, so I passed. \n\nThe food was amazing my gosh! The breading was so crispy and the meet was tender and juicy. This is definitely the place to get your katsu fix! You might miss the turn though because it's not in a big plaza, but if your food is good, people will find it, and you will find those people. \n\nGive this place a visit!"

            "review": "Wow--this place is the real deal!!  We decided to go and check this place out during our vacation in Vegas (we're from Honolulu, HI) when I saw all the awesome reviews on Yelp and the pictures of what appeared to be authentic Japanese-style tonkatsu!  What makes it look authentic, you say? Well, they use the little wire strainers on the plate under the katsu to keep the food from soaking in any excess oil that may remain after frying, keeping the katsu crunchy and tasty!  After studying the menu, noticing how reasonable the prices were for authentic katsu and getting a thumbs up from my wife, we went for lunch.  Upon arriving, we figured the place must have opened recently, since it still had a huge \"NOW OPEN!\" banner hanging above the restaurant 's name over the front door.  We entered and saw it was not a very large place--maybe six tables that can seat 4-6 each and a counter that can serve another six customers.  It was, however, very clean and authentic looking with the lacquer dishes, numerous decorations and Japanese kanji characters abound.  A large man behind the counter greeted us with the familiar Japanese welcome phrase, \"Irashaimase!\"  After grabbing a few items, he then made his way to our table, served us some ice water and handed us menus. My wife ordered the chicken and shrimp katsu combination dinner, while I chose to have the beef tataki appetizer and hire katsu dinner.  After placing the order with the kitchen, he came back and showed us how to make our own katsu sauce by grinding up the sesame seeds in the special grinding bowl using a wooden stick, which we already knew how to do because we experienced it in Japan two years ago.  After making our katsu sauce, the beef tataki arrived, and man was it delicious!  Well-marbled beef is seared slightly on the outside, thinly sliced then served rare on a bed of finely grated daikon and a shiso leaf, accompanied with ponzu sauce for dipping--I was in beef-lovers heaven!  While enjoying my appetizer, we found out that our server was none other than owner Kiyoshi, who learned the ropes about tonkatsu and Japanese cuisine from his grandmother while he was growing up in Japan as a boy.  He had also gained invaluable experience about Las Vegas and the food scene there through his nine years of experience working at Bellagio, but decided a few years ago he wanted to branch out and own his own place.  After some discussion with his investment partners, they decided to open Tonkatsu Kiyoshi in November, 2013 at its present location, and he said he is pleased with how things are going for the restaurant for the six months since.  A few moments later, our dinners (lunches?) arrived, and they were fantastic!  Each dinner was accompanied with miso soup, savory and full of pieces of tofu and seaweed--warm and delicious!  Also served with our dinner was a hot bowl of white rice, shredded cabbage and rakkyo--little pickled onions that are tart and lip-smacking yummy!  The cabbage was accompanied with an oriental salad dressing, while my wife's shrimp katsu also had a separate sauce.  The tonkatsu I ordered was awesome--the panko crust nicely browned, not at all oily and nicely crisp, and it paired really well with the katsu sauce we concocted earlier.  My wife's shrimp katsu was crunchy, tasty, made with very fresh shrimp and also paired well with the special sauce Kiyoshi brought for it.  Her chicken katsu was tender and moist, not firm like the tonkatsu I was having, but just as delicious.  I am already home in Honolulu now, but drooling just thinking about our wonderful katsu meal at Tonkatsu Kiyoshi and very much looking forward to visiting there again next time I'm in Las Vegas!"

The curry here has the PERFECT taste. It's not too overpowering with the curry taste or smell in your mouth. They have sesame seeds as a condiment on the table, for you to grind up and add more flavor to the curry! \n\nI ordered the tonkatsu curry, it was so delightful! The pork was cooked perfect and so were the vegetables in the curry. I also ordered agedashi tofu and the cold tofu. I'm not a fan of the cold tofu, but the agedashi was so bomb!! It was in some sort of broth that just added more gr8 flavors. \n\nThe service was great too! I came in at around 9pm, close to closing. And even though a big party of about 10-14 people just came in, at the same time we did, service was still awesome!! The girl was very attentive and the guy was too- when seating us. :-)\n\nI WILL BE BACKKK!!~~"

Very friendly, very accommodating.  Constantly checking if we need anything. \n\nFood: I ordered the chicken tonkatsu and shrimp combo while my daughter ordered the pork tonkatsu.  The serving, in my opinion is too big for one person but I ended up eating almost all of it (delish).  They had a special side order and we got the fried spam masubi (excellent) and the fried quid tentacles (was fried too much). I specially like how they engage their customer and making them pound and grind their own sesame seeds and make their own sauce for dipping. \n\nCost: reasonable cost of food considering how big the serving is.  Side order price is reasonable also at $5 per order.  \n\nAll in all, great place to eat and hang out.  Excellent food and excellent service.  Too bad that it is so far away from where we live but definitely will go back there if we are in the vicinity of the place."

I get that it's not their normal dish so I did not expect much. However, when we told the server, he didn't seem to care. Ever since we told the server about that particular dish being a little too salty, he stopped coming over to our table. We asked for extra plain noodle on the side to offset the saltiness and I had no problem paying extra for it but man..  Given the circumstance, the entire time we were being as polite as possible, the attitude we received from the server was unacceptable. He never once was apologetic, he ignored our table for the rest of our meal, and made us feel very uncomfortable (staring at us but never approaching the table)."

I was in the mood for ramen that night, but agreed to try it since they also served miso soup with their dishes. As soon as we walked in, my friend placed an order for 2 spam musubis, since they usually run out. I was leaning toward getting the katsu donburi but got the pork and shrimp combination instead. While waiting for our food, we ground up some sesame seeds to include with the tonkatsu sauce, which was a fun little ritual. Everything we ate was delicious. The salads were fresh with just the right amount of dressing. The tonkatsu breading was perfect with tender, juicy meat inside. And the miso soup hit the spot. Service was quick and very friendly."

It was not busy at all when I stepped into the restaurant at 8 pm.  There were only two tables occupied with customers.  As usual, I sat at their counter seating area facing the kitchen and their cooking staff.  There were 5 people working in the kitchen.  I looked at their one page menu and decided to order their rosu katsu dinner ($12.00).  On the counter top in front of me was a wooden box filled with condiments.  There was a container full of sesame seeds that you could grind up yourself.  So while I was waiting, I grinded some sesame seeds for my meal. My katsu dinner arrived about 10 minutes later.  It came with miso soup, a small bowl of white rice, a pile of shredded cabbage (I don't believe that they offer free refills as they do in Japan), dipping sauce and 2 pickled scallions.  The katsu was a little on the dry side and it wasn't a very big portion.  The breading was quite crispy though and not greasy.  Would I come here again?  May be, to try their chicken katsu."

She was about to seat me at one of the free tables in the front and asked how many were in my party. I told her it was just me and she suddenly had a party of 10(!) coming in and refused to seat me. This is not exactly the type of restaurant one makes a reservation at, not to mention there were only 8 free chairs left in the entire place. Something sure stinks, and in my opinion it smells a little like RACISM.\n\nI will be telling everyone I know NEVER to patronize this establishment.\n\n--- \n\nSince it looks like Yelp doesn't post responses to responses on the review page, I wish to point out that every single website I've been able to find listing this restaurant, including yelp itself, indicates that the restaurant does not accept reservations. This is as of 11/16/16. Be sure that this will now magically change in order to fit the story Meredith has put forward about a 7pm reservation. \n\nI think the ownership needs to take a good look at the reviews for their business. There are several on here that note one of the employees yelling across the restaurant at customers. Additionally, I don't appreciate the lie about not being able to hear. You asked me straight to my face how many were in my party and then when I said it was just me, which you seemed to hear just fine, you told me oh we have a reservation for 10 coming in. Why would you ask me how many were in my party at all if you weren't planning to seat me? Where were the other 2 patrons in the party of 10 going to sit? There were only 8 free chairs in the entire restaurant - trust me I looked around and counted seats when you told me there was a party of 10 coming into a 25 seat restaurant. This is about as ridiculous as making a reservation at the L&L or Grand Sign Kitchen, 2 of your local competitors."

Almost...\n\nBut alas, we're not in Japan, and for the most part, Tonkatsu here is a heavier, oilier version of the original, and if you're lucky, the Pork doesn't taste like your belt.. or is as thin...\n\nAnd then Tonkatsu Kiyoshi come into town, and all is good.  Located in an area that no matter where you live, takes a butt long time to get to, since it's in a residential-ish area with rudimentary access (Vegas, could you hurry up and upgrade the road conditions already)?  I was a little trepidatious at first, I really didn't want to go if it was just another L&L BBQ or Ross J's... (no offense)...\n\nThe venue is not big, under 40 seats total with a great counter for single dining; the interior is pretty bare bones, but understandable considering its location and casual service.  \n\nIts always a good sign to see Sesame and Tonkatsu sauce on the table with your own mini mortar and pestle.  You grind the Sesame seeds and then pour the tart sauce over to create a goopy concoction to dip your flaky fried Tonkatsu, I prefer to add a little hot mustard to give it a kick!\n\nAs mini starters, we ordered the Crab and Cucumber Salad and the House made Potato Salad.  I loved how the dishes came in ceramics authentic to a Japanese Tonkatsu House, and looked forward how the dishes would taste.\n\nThe House Potato Salad had Cucumber, Apple and Japanese Mayonnaise (Kewpie).  Although it was good, It was a little watered down and not as creamy as I was expecting.  But then again, with all the fried food that was about to be consumed, maybe creamy was overkill...\n\nSo the next dish we ordered was the Crab Cucumber Salad.... which to my disappointment, was not with real Crab but with Crab Sticks or 'Kamaboko' - basically imitation crab made from white fish meat.  But, for $3.50, I should have realized that the fact that this wan't going to be a real Crab dish.\n\nOddly enough, there was a disproportionate amount of Crabstick in comparison to Cucumber.  It was an odd dish for sure.\n\nAs for the Tonkatsu, I got the combination set with  two pieces of\nTenderloin (Hire) and two Fried Shrimp.  You have two types of cuts to choose from: Hire and Rosu (Thick cut Pork Loin).  Usually I get the Hire; it's a softer cut that comes installer, thinner pieces.  If I'm really hungry, I'll get the Rosu which is thicker and bigger but a little tougher to chew.\n\nI was thoroughly amazed at how soft the Tonkutsu was, it was fried perfectly too, not greasy in the least, it was very light and easy to eat.  It was a authentic as I could ever have imagined, like being back in Japan.  The Miso Soup was the real thing as well, and the Rice was spot on (yes, you can fuck up Rice...)\n\nThe Fried Shimp was ok, again fried to perfection but I wasn't sure about the freshness of the Shrimp.  I would get it again.\n\nBut all in all, its definitely worth going back to for the Hire Katsu.  And with a couple of combinations you can get as well as Katsu Curry, It's a place I can back again and again!\n\nRatings (Out of Five Stars)\nFood:           4\nAmbience:  Ummm\nService:       4.75"

The 1st thing I noticed was the small menu, and there wasn't really much choice besides various katsus...hence their name. We ordered chicken katsu and a pork katsu curry. Both katsu entrees were very crispy the breading was a perfect golden brown. I liked the chicken a little more since it was lighter and juicer than the pork. Definitely some of the better katsu entrees I've ever had, but I thought the pricing was a little steep for some fried meat, rice and miso soup.  \n\nI was a little confused on how to make the katsu sauce and I found myself mashing up a concoction of sesame seeds and sauce together which apparently isn't the way it's supposed to be done? I also thought you were supposed to mash up the little shalots/onions they give you...Eventually I gave up and just ate everything plain...I still have no idea how to properly prepare the sauces, shalots, etc.\n\nDining experience here is ok...while the service was great, it was super hot in the dining area which made it uncomfortable since I felt hot and sweaty the whole meal. Is there not a/c that can be turned on during business hours? I felt like I drank 4-5 glasses of water because it was so hot and then I pretty much lost my appetite from filling up on water instead of food.\n\nI would come back again but it wouldn't be my 1st choice. Their food was good, but maybe next time I'll grab it to go instead of suffering through a 80-90 degree dining room."

Service is top notch; the Tonkatsu makes me feel like I'm back in Japan; and the cold beer helps add the icing on the cake.  This is still the \"go to spot\" for any Japanese food living fans, especially those who crave Tonkatsu; but even if you don't, it doesn't matter--you still must come and check it out--it's that good!!!"

I always start with their beef tataki, lightly seared on the outside with just the right amount of seasoning. Hire and shrimp is my favorite entree, everything's so nicely cooked and tender. Must try this place if you have never been here, you will fall in love just like me!"

Located in a strip center -  self parking was a breeze to locate.\n\nIt was lunch and I went with the pork Tonkatsu. The entree came with miso soup, salad and steam rice. The portion was generous and my friendly waitress crushed sesame seeds and mixed it with a sauce which was yummy for the pork Tonkatsu. The Tonkatsu was crispy on the outside and moist and hot inside. \n\nI'm so looking forward to returning and trying their curry."

I love the pride they take in their product here. I once asked if they were able to make the curry in the katsu dinner spicy, that was when I was told, \"We're a Katsu House, not a Curry House.\" At first you might be taken back from that comment, but as you spend any time here it is readily evident that they are highly passionate about their katsu...and that comes through in the quality of their food.\n\nThey will recommend the Hire (Pork Tenderloin) Katsu if you ask. I shared this the first time I came here, and, while good, I haven't ordered it again. Instead I usually get the Tori (Chicken) Katsu Dinner...I like the flavor of the chicken more, but I eat a lot more chicken than pork, so I may be biased and you may need to try them both and decide. The last time I was here was my favorite visit and opened me up to even more possibilities. I came in with my love and her daughter and we shared Tori Katsu, Ebi (Shrimp) Fry, and Salmon (Salmon) Fry. The salmon was the hit of the table, but everything was absolutely enjoyed...so we may need to come again with 3 or 4 of us to continue to be able to share a few items.\n\nWe also enjoyed the opportunity to make our sauce by grinding the sesame seeds with the pestle and mortar. I brought my sister here previously and the simple act of grinding the seeds was memorable part of that experience as well.\n\nThere are curry options in the specials section of their menu...they are solid options...definitely not to be avoided...but again, they're a katsu house, not a curry house, and there are slightly better curry options in town IMHO.\n\nTonkatsu Kiyoshi is certainly worth trying out if you like pork or chicken cutlets...and an absolute must if you like katsu as it's one of the best in town!"

You can make your own combination of katsu sauce with sesame seeds as both are available on tubs topping the tables. Be sure to crush your sesame seeds for maximal flavor explosion. The curry tonkatsu option also really hits the spot if you're in the mood for that. Among the appetizers I've tried, the Beef Tataki and Edamame were pretty good. But a darkhorse: the Japanese potato salad, is the real winner in my eyes. The owner and servers are always really nice and attentive. Definitely a great place to check out off the strip.\n\nP.S. No alcohol license yet. When it comes, watch out. Beer mania."

What was cool is that they give you a pestle and mortar to grind your own sesame seeds down into fine powder to add to your katsu sauce which I was blown away by. I felt like I was in 5th grade all over again.\n\nThey have exceptional service. Whenever my water was empty the waitress would run over and fill it immediately. The interior was really cute, a few tables and a large bar. They don't serve beer yet which is a shame because I guess they're a fairly new restaurant and still awaiting on their liquor license.\n\nWe ordered the tiger shrimp & chicken katsu dinner which was only 14$ It was such a great deal. It also came with this spicy mustard that I recommend to add to your katsu  sauce. It came with miso soup and this yummy shredded lettuce salad. Also, we got the beef tataki $7 which was cooked perfectly, and decorated with a bed of onions and some weird sauce. Lastly, we got the soft shell crab $7 which was ahhhhhhmaaaaaaazzzzinnnngggg! I will definitely be getting that again.\n\nOur total bill was 30$ which is a steal. I was definitely be back, I want to see if they will make me a chicken katsu curry because I do not eat pork!"

            "review": "I forgot to ask who Kiyoshi was!  All I know is that it is a common Japanese boy's name.  Tonkatsu on the other hand (which I often confuse with Tonkotsu) is deep fried panko-breaded pork cutlet.  Just like breaded pork chop, Japanese style. When you enter the place, it looks very Japanese with the set-up and d\u00e9cor, but there was summer-y Hawaiian music playing in the background.  The place is tiny and I'm glad we went at an odd hour.\n\nIf we came more hungry, I would've wanted to try their beef tataki and daily special off menu agedashi tofu.  But today, we went straight to the entrees.  We had... \n\n1. The miso soup which came with both our orders.  This was awesome, definitely a notch above your standard bowls in Jap restaurants.  \n\n2. The Katsu Curry which has 2 pork cutlets, lots of rice, lots of curry with chunks of potato and carrot.  Their katsu preparation is good - thick cuts that maintain their juiciness with breading that is light and not greasy.  Their curry sauce has much stronger flavors than your typical Japanese curry, in fact, it really reminded me of the Indian version.  Hubby enjoyed it.\n\n3. The Katsudon (Katsu donburi) has katsu over rice topped with egg and katsudon sauce (which is a savory-sweet sauce).  There were a couple of grilled shishito peppers on the side as well.  The katsu itself is not salty and is meant to be dipped in curry or tonkatsu sauce so I wish this thin type sauce was tastier.  It was, however, still very good. \n\n4. Chicken Karaage for the lil man.  This was a very different preparation from the karaages in ramen joints.  The batter is not as light and the piece of chicken is denser.  Although good, I prefer the ramen joint version a lot better. \n\n5. Japanese potato salad.  This is a sweeter version of a classic with eggs and cucumbers.  A refreshing side to cut the fried goodness.\n\n6. Melon soda.  It comes in a bottle and I didn't care for this too much because it has a Yakult after taste.  But hubby loved it so much he asked for one to go.  Try it if you haven't had any melon soda yet.\n\n7. Their tonkatsu dipping sauce.  I love places that serve condiments.  I really do.  Each table comes with sauce and roasted sesame seeds which you grind yourself with a wooden pestle.  The tonkatsu sauce tastes like the Bulldog bottles you buy in Jap grocery stores.  If you haven't had this condiment, you might really love it or find it weird because it is slightly sour.  Kinda like catsup meets soy sauce meets sugar meets Worcestershire sauce.  I like it though.  And normally, I don't care much for sesame seeds but man!  The roasted sesame flakes on this tonkatsu sauce really elevates it to another level.  Real good stuff.\n\nWe enjoyed our meal a lot, and service rocked.  However, for the 2 entrees, 2 sides and 4 drinks, our bill was already over $50 with tip.  It's not cheap, and I wish it was so I can keep coming back.  But if you are a fan of fried Japanese goodness, then you might end up being a Kiyoshi groupie."

Very similar to the ones I've tried in Japan, I am really excited that this place is well within my side of town. \n\nHowever, the place is very small. It seats 6 parties, and they have a bar that can accommodate probably 3 guests. So, I was glad we came on a Tuesday! Another thing is their sodas come in cans. This made my husband almost lose his cool. $1.25 for a can of soda is very un-American for a restaurant. If the soda machine is broken or if you don't have one, I think the customer should know beforehand. Lastly, our server yesterday was very unhappy. She just looked like she wasn't pleased to be working there. \n\nAnyway, we will definitely be coming back here. Personally, to order the same katsu and curry rice combo. We'll probably just get water too ;)"

I thought Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is pretty legit. \n\nWe had two appetizers. The karaage and the gyoza. The karaage was okay. I've had better but the chicken was still quite juicy. I really like the gyoza though. Might be because of the sauce. The soy sauce had some yuzu flavor to it which really brought out the gyoza. Not to mention that the gyoza had a light skin and a good stuffing. \n\nI had the tonkatsu pork and shrimp. You are given all the sauce ingredients like the sesame and the grinder on the table. Personally, part of the fun is to be able to grind the sesame itself and I always feel like it makes it legit when you have the sesame seeds to grind for Tonkatsu places. With that said, it was a big portion for a good pricing. You are given two pork(that are already cut for you) and 2 big shrimps. I personally thought the shrimp was really good, might be even better than the pork in fact. They fried it to perfection with the panko and it was the perfect proportion of the skin and the big fat shrimp. \n\nService was pretty good. The server actually had a mishap with our order and she gave us the appetizer as an apology."

            "review": "The tonkatsu here is so fresh and crispy!  It reminds me of the famous tonkatsu restaurant in Waikiki, Tonkatsu Ginza Bairin.  This restaurant just opened up 3 weeks ago and I have already been here 3 times... I think I like this place.\n\nThe owner Mark and his family run the restaurant.  He is from Japan originally but lived in HI before moving here to Vegas.  He is super nice and remembers me every time I come in.  I have had a chance to try a lot of their menu over the past 3 visits.\n\nAppetizers:  The 2 most popular ones are the chicken karaage and the beef tataki.  The chicken is really good served with the lemon.  Beef comes with a ponzu sauce and tons of onions!  Yum.\n\nEntrees:  The Hire katsu is a classic pork katsu that is juicy and not dried out like a lot of the pork katsu's I've had before.  Simple and delicious.  The Katsu curry is nice because it is the same pork as the Hire katsu but served with Japanese curry and veggies on the side.  It gives you the option to use the curry sauce or the tonkatsu sauce to dip your meat in.  The Katsu-don is a bowl of pork katsu and rice served with an egg cooked on top of it with onions and a soupy sauce.  I preferred the other two dishes more because the cripsy crust is slightly soggier with the egg and onions on top.  The salmon and shrimp katsu is a nice option if you want to mix things up.  I have never had salmon katsu before!  \n\nDessert:  I have only tried the melon floats but they are delicious!  Green melon soda with ice cream!\n\nThe funnest part about this place is that you get to make your own tonkatsu sauce... sorta.  You use the little mortar and pestle to grind your sesame seeds and then you mix the seeds with the tonkatsu sauce.  Their sauce is soooo good!   I think it is the best tonkatsu sauce I have had.\n\nSee you guys next week :)"

I got the katsu curry, and my other friends got the takoyaki, katsu donburi and salmon fry and ebi fry katsu dinner. \n\nThe prices were reasonable for the large portions and quality of the food, but it would nice to get a little more meat in the lunch specials. The katsu breading was crisp and thick, but still light, and is delicious no matter if you dip it in the curry or the tonkatsu sauce (I could drink this stuff honestly, don't skip out on it), and the rice is perfectly cooked. I loved the melon cream soda float, it was super refreshing and perfect with the heavy curry. \n\nService was extremely friendly, despite the fact that our party consisted of 6 teenage girls who all wanted separate checks, some paying with card and some with cash. The only thing stopping this place from being five stars was the wait for food, but I'm not going to blame them for it- the food was great and the place was packed."

I also ordered the cucumber crab salad with kewpie dressing and a side of curry. Kewpie dressing is normally creamy and nutty this dressing was not. \n\nThe panko batter on both the chicken and pork was light and crunchy. I liked the chicken more because the pork lacked flavor. The curry was no different than the curry bars I have used at home. The rice was overcooked and mushy. I did like the well developed flavor profile of the miso soup and the ginger dressing on the salad was refreshing. \n\nI was going to order the green tea cheesecake but after seeing the pictures showing the tiny sliver of cheesecake accompanied by a big scoop of ice cream I chose to pass."

Cabbage salad with dressing, miso soup, rice and your choice of protein (pork, chicken, shrimp, tofu, etc). \n\nGreat quality appetizers such as chicken karaage, octopus balls, croquets, fried spam musubi's and a standard, yet thirst quenching Asian beer selection.\n\nThe staff is extremely friendly with roots in guest service from one of the best properties on the strip (think Ocean's 11 to avoid any trademark issues). The location itself is a bit small however the only time this becomes a problem is the lunch and dinner rush.\n\nThere is no way to describe the best breaded Chicken Katsu in town until you've dipped your piece (chicken piece that is) in their sauce and let your taste buds do the talking. \n\nThey're set up for six - 4 tops and  bar seating. They do to-go orders but I highly recommend you take your time with this and done in.\n\nI promise you, you will not find better Katsu in Las Vegas."

Being the only specialty katsu I know of in the valley, it definitely does not disappoint. One bite of their katsu and you can immediately tell the difference in terms of theirs, and any other katsu meal you can find in a Japanese themed restaurant.\n\nMy go to meal is the classic Chicken Katsu. I sincerely believe that the get the krispiness spot on, as well as the texture of the chicken. I love how it's such a big meal too, as it definitely makes you feel like you've spent your money's worth. Every meal comes with appetizers such as miso soup, cabbage or salad depending on your meal, and a side of rice. I also recommend their donburi. It's one of the better ones I've had in the city.\n\nOne of the things that makes this place so great is the authenticity of your experience. One step into this place, and you can immediately tell its Japanese. A lot of people may say that this place is small and cramped, but if you have ever been to Japan, all the shops there give exactly this small, cozy and whole in the wall kind of vibe. Their decorations are also very oriental. You can also make your own katsu sauce by grinding the sesame seeds yourself. That makes a nice, fun addition that gives you something to do as you wait for your meal."

It's quick and easy to make and it's yummy.\n\nThere was a bunch of stuff occupying our table - what is all this mess? Salt, pepper, togarashi, a bowl of sesame seeds, a bowl of katsu sauce, a mortar and pestle...and fake flowers. I was busy grinding my sesame seeds for my katsu that I forgot to look at the menu. I've been here quite a few times to try everything on the menu as much as I can. The consistent observation I have is that no matter what kind of protein you get, it won't be dry and it will be delicious. Not oily at all. Their dinners and combinations come with rice, miso soup, shredded cabbage and Japanese pickles.\n\nKara'age:\nBreaded and deep-fried pieces of chicken. Salty, mildly sweet and spicy. They're a little bit overcooked so they taste a bit burnt but the inside wasn't dry. I'll skip this next time. 3/5\n\nBeef Tataki:\nThin slices of lightly seared beef with a ponzu + daikon dipping sauce. 4.5/5\n\nChicken Katsu Curry:\nPanko-breaded and deep-fried chicken, comes with rice and miso soup only. This is not on the menu but you can definitely ask for chicken instead of pork. The katsu itself was great but the curry is better at Zen. 4/5\n\nHire Katsu and Shrimp Katsu:\nPanko-breaded and deep-fried pork tenderloin katsu and shrimps. \n\nTori Katsu Dinner:\nPanko-breaded and deep-fried chicken. 5/5\n\nSalmon Fry Katsu Dinner:\nUsually, when you deep-fry salmon, it gets pretty dry and flaky (kind of like dandruff). But here at Kiyoshi, they know how to do it right. 5/5\n\nPineapple Panna Cotta:\nThis was so good and had the perfect pineapple flavor to it. I'm tired of plain old panna cotta and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. This has whipped cream and coconut shavings on top...like a pina colada panna cotta. 4/5 \n\nGreen tea Cheesecake:\nI've had green tea cheesecake that have been pure fail where you can hardly taste green tea. THIS is how green tea cheesecake was meant to taste like. 5/5\n\nThe service has always been great. Friendly and very attentive. The food comes out within 10-15 minutes after ordering."

In its simplest preparation, a piece of pork loin is tenderized and the flattened pork is breaded and deep fried until cooked.  It is traditionally served with a tonkatsu sauce, but it is jut as common served with Japanese curry and rice.  However you eat it, a good tonkatsu meal will fill your belly and bring a smile to your face.\n\nAt Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, the same Japanese tonkatsu is wonderfully prepared and served here.  And like many of the specialty tonkatsu restaurants in Japan and much of Asia, they offer a variety of different preparations (although the selections overseas is significantly greater than what is available here).\n\nThe tonkatsu I have tried thus far have all been fried perfectly, where the pork is still cooked but nice, tender and juicy inside.  It is so flavorful that you don't even really need the tonkatsu sauce (you can customize it by grinding toasted sesame seeds and mix it in with their pre-made tonkatsu sauce).  The portions are good for the price.\n\nOn my first visit, i tried their Tonkatsu Donburi. Which is just tonkatsu served over rice in the style of a traditional Oyako Donburi (Mother Daughter Rice Bowl or something like that, because they kinkily served the chicken with the egg. Get it ;P).  It was very good!\n\nOne of the things I wish is available is the choice of breading for the tonkatsu.  In Japan and in Taiwan, where I ave visited everything from high end premium tonkatsu restaurants to very good fast food tonkatsu chains, they all have more options than what is available as is on the menu.  It is not a huge thing, but sometimes a little more choices make the customer just that much happier.\n\nThe miso soup was excellent too, even though that is never the reason for me to ever go to any restaurant.\n\nFor what is available in the area, Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is unquestionably the best. (Voicing the same sentiment as Philip T in case it is less obvious in this paraphrasing).\n\n3.75 rounded up to the nearest whole integer equals 4."

Choice of either the softer, less fatty tenderloin of the slightly more firm loin from an everyday pig.  Served traditionally or as a donburi or with curry.

It's also good entertainment (and may help build your appetite) while waiting for food to come out.  Order the melon float after if you have room to spare.  Kind of reminds me of a Melona bar - not too sweet or heavy. \n\nThe restaurant is always clean and service is always nice.  Sometimes a tad slow but it's ok - it's a small family run place!  Just relax and enjoy. \n\nThank you for having such a limited menu but executing so well. (beats those restaurants that have a million things on the menu but nothing tastes good)  Also thanks for great ventilation. None of that \"stinky Chinese food place\" smell on your clothes when you leave. \n\nMake the trip if you haven't yet - who can pass up deliciously fried meat?!?"

So last night, I finally got off my lazy butt and headed out to try this place.\n\nThe inside was bigger than I thought. It was pretty spacious and there was a bar area for people dining alone. On the table is a jar of sesame seeds and a jar of katsu sauce. The server then gave us a tiny mortar and pestle that you use to grind the seeds. You can add this later on to the katsu sauce. That was an interesting experience for sure! \n\nSo we ordered the gyoza to start. I had the Pork Curry Katsu and my boyfriend had the Chicken Katsu. Both of the katsus were delicious. They cooked it crispy on the outside while the meat remain moist. I hate dry katsu so they really hit it spot on at this place. What I think made them stood out the most from other Japanese places is their Katsu sauce. It is delicious with the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. I loved it so much that I even dipped my pork katsu more on that sauce rather than the curry sauce that it came with.\n\nI highly recommend this place. I love their matcha green tea too. It was perfect."

            "review": "Adding my input to this very likable place.  Best idea anyone has come up with in a long time for a restaurant name and menu.  Ate here not long ago for the very first time when the daughter mention this place.  Simple menu (all tonkatsu), side dishes were very selective and good, appetizers were good, as well as the deserts.  Only grip I have is there is to much shredded cabbage on the plate that takes the place of the rice (very small serving of rice bowl). Swap out the rice and cabbage portions and it would the number one place to eat.  To much cabbage will give you gas.  Donburi was a little dry but still very good.  This is the second place that I know of that offers Katsu-don here in the valley.  I've been trying to find a really good Katsu-don place since I first ate this dish way back in the Vietnam war (best one I've had ever) in 1968.  The only place better than this place is my sisters house in Tampa, Florida, but its so far away so I gotta go here to get my dish.  Another gripe is the tonkatsu portions are very small compared to other Hawaiian/Japanese restaurants in the valley plus the price is a bit on the high side.  Single slab of meat versus two slabs for the same price.  Increasing the portions size will surely help enlarge the customer base.  Curry katsu is very ono so you gotta try this one."

You just have to ask them for more.\n       - Preference - I prefer either the Hire (3 pieces of pork) or Tori (chicken) Katsu. The Hire for when I'm hungry & the Tori for when I'm not as hungry. I like my katsu crust crisp and these two dishes provide that.\n       - Picked pearl onions - A pallet cleanser. Never had it anywhere else, but it was pretty good. It's like a mild onion soaked in sweetness.\n       - Sauce - At the table there are two containers. Sesame seeds & katsu sauce. They give you a mortar & pestle. Traditionally, you'll take the sesame seeds, crush them with the pestle, and pour the katsu sauce over it and mix. Very authentic.\n       - Cabbage - The shredded cabbage is given with a Japanese vinaigrette on the side. I usually like ordering a side of Curry so I can pour that over the cabbage and eat it with that. I don't like the sour taste of the dressing as much.\n**Ordered**\n       - $12 Hire Katsu Dinner - 3 Pieces of pork katsu. Perfectly breaded. Crispy & delicious. A hungry man's meal.\n       - $10 Rosu Katsu Dinner - 1 Larger piece of pork katsu that's a bit bigger and oilier.  The oils also make the bottom of the katsu a bit soggy. I preferred the Hire.\n       - $8 Tori Katsu Dinner - Chicken katsu. Pretty good for a pork alternative.\n       - $15 Hire Katsu & Shrimp Katsu Dinner - 2 pieces of pork katsu and 2 huge breaded tiger prawns. \n       - $12 Katsu Donburi - Caramelized onions & egg on top of pork katsu. The egg & onions makes the breaded katsu crust soggy. I think this defeats the purpose of katsu. The added flavor is not worth this trade-off.\n       - $12 Katsu Curry - The curry makes the katsu crust soggy. I don't really like that.\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice local Katsu place. They only serve Katsu, but they serve it well!"

I'm uneducated when it comes to the history and deconstruction of a tonkatsu.  I only followed what the table of overseas Japanese did for their tonkatsu. They grounded the sesame seeds and added the house made slightly sweet tonkatsu sauce. Who knows if I had mixed the grounded sesame and sauce in the proper bowl. \n\nYes, the ambiance is minimus Japanese with no hint of 808 origin except when Mike spoke to us and asked what we thought of his tonkatsu and provided a little bit of the history of the restaurant.  He had mentioned that we were sitting in the original Rice Trax that's now further up the street and how it took a little more than a year of searching to decide on this location. So Hawaiian follows Hawaiian.  But that's where the similarity stops.\n\nI've tried many of LAS Japanese, Korean, Hawaiian and Chinese so called tonkatsu hotspots and as for comparison Tonkatsu Kiyoshi simply runs away with top honors.\n\nFrom the scent of the freshly grounded sesame seeds, slightly sweet flavor of tonkatsu sauce, presentation of our meal on a tray, skill of preparation, consistency of light greaseless crust encasing the very eveningly cooked moist pork and huge tiger prawns, finely shaved cabbage salad with dressing, pickled scallion, dab of yellow mustard, slice of lemon and fresh bowl of steamy rice, I was most impressed from the very first bite and all the way to the satisfying last bite. I took no prisoners in the process.\n\nI have only high praises for this restaurant that feeds me great tasting tonkatsu in my own backyard."

Couple things I noticed about this place... First, it's deep on the south side of town. It doesn't bother me as much since this is my neighborhood. However, if this place seeks to be a busy business, it's a far reach. Second, if it wasn't for word of mouth and a flyer, I probably wouldn't have found this place. It's literally hidden. The strip mall itself is brand new and it's located in a residential area. The place itself is small for a restaurant but it's cozy. \n\nNow... For the food... I'm a fan of Katsu dishes. For the price that you pay on this joint, it's pretty loaded. You get a decent amount of food for your order. It comes with Miso soup as well. I was lucky to have met the owner during my visit and he was very accommodating (asking if it's your first time and what not), introduces you to the menu and lays you the details. As soon as your order is taken, you have the chance to make your own Katsu dressing. They have all the ingredients laid out on a small tray on every table. This allows you to set your own sauce for your liking. \n\nI forgot the name of the dish I ordered but it came with shrimp tempura and the Katsu itself, paired with rice, cabbage and Miso soup. I'm a very simple guy when it comes to taste. I believe my dish was served well. The amount of breading used wasn't overboard either. Seasoning is just right and not too salty. Unfortunately, i went here on a Monday night and I was the only one eating. It made the experience a little awkward since everyone was pretty much just staring at me while I pig out. \n\nI would definitely give this place another go. It's the type of joint you won't go to as much considering the prices of their food but it's a thumbs up in my book. The place has potential. It just needs to market itself more due to its location. Hopefully, it will pick up business when the sports bar next door opens."

If your little one is a picky eater, just ask that they put the chicken on a separate plate because the order usually comes with a little salad and places the chicken on a bed of cabbage.

We drove out here to try it out from Henderson and it was totally worth it. As usual, I read reviews before trying this place out / driving 15 miles and the reviews of Rod U, Lawrence C and Jennifer D caused me to be quite ready for this evening's quest.\n\na. Normally - I am normally getting Tonkatsu or Chicken Katsu from a place like L and L Hawaiian.  Oddly, there was an L and L a few blocks away from this place.  While I find it extremely convenient to get it from L and L, I also know it is like me getting chow mein or fried rice at Panda.  Edible, comforting, but just not the same.  Here at TK, this is the real deal in Tonkatsu.\n\nb.  Ahhh Curry - There are a few pleasures in foodie life and Japanese Curry is one of them. I love all types of curry, = Thai, Indian, Chinese, Japanese.  From the hottest to the mildest.  However, I find that the Japanese Curry like what they have here is simply the best. If you like mild curry over rice with carrots and potatoes, this is it.\n\nc.  Miso Soup - I pretty much always have miso paste at home and make plenty of variations of miso soup from hearty vegetables soup to your basic miso.  I consider myself a Miso fan and the miso here is pretty darn good. Finished mine and most of my wives.  Yep, and I slurped it all without using a spoon.  Just slurped away and used the chopsticks.  Now, while I am not Japanese, I find that eating the soup like they do in Japan, by putting your mouth to the bowl and drinking, using the chopsticks for the bits you cannot swaggle down is a great way to enjoy the soup. Here the soup was just right. Be sure to chuggle it down while it is hot. I also keep getting spell check warnings here, so I am sure swaggle and chuggle are not words but that is what comes to mind with this Miso Soup.\n\nd.  The TK Sauce - What am I to do with the sesame seed and the tonkatsu sauce, mortar and pestle?  See, I have been trained to eat tonkatsu at L and L and am used to having the sauce in a little plastic takeaway thingamajig.  Here you get to pour out a good spoonful or so of sesame seed, and use the pestle to grind down the seeds to mix it with the sauce.  That was fun and since I did not have a clue, I had to ask the waitress how on rudimentary tonkatsu sauce preparation.  I am so glad I did, i love learning about foods and processes and tradition. And, this was FUN!\n\ne.  What to order - I was totally befuddled in what to order. While my wife ordered the \"Hire\" tonkatsu, I was stuck between the Hire,, the Ebi and the Curry. Reading the reviews and all, I wanted to try them all.  So, I asked the waitress, what to do what to do.  See, there relatively small but perfect menu did not have this combo on it.  So she said, order the Hire, Ebi, Curry combo.  Yep, they said they could put that together no problem!  That was cool.\n\nHire Katsu - Plenty big portion and very tender and crispy, light and delicate.  I really enjoyed it, okay, compared to my norm and limited experience.\n\nMiso Soup, Shaved Cabbage, Scallion and a sauce for the cabbage round out this dish. All was just right. I could have ate a bunch more of the pickled scallion, Rakkyo, they give you.\n\nCurry - The plate was in a yin yang fashion with Japanese rice on the yin and the curry on the yang.  Then, a bit of Hire Katsu and Ebi Katsu on the rice.  If you are ancient like I am, it was like that old tootsie pop commercial where the kid is trying to find out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop.  (See this youtube if you are too young).  Anyhoo,  I was pretty darn anxious to get to the curry and rice so I am not sure but I did a David Copperfield on the Ebi and Hire Katsu and they disappeared quickly. Then I got to the curry and rice.  I have not been eating white rice for a long time and here I made an exception because this was like the best ono thing to do!\n\nHot Tea - I ordered hot tea and got an ever filling cup of ocha, that was pretty darn good.  Could have been a bit hotter, but it was full of flavor.\n\nf.  How about that service - Now, the last place I was at, was Bachi Burger for the wifey's birthday and well, the service from the maitre'd, shift manager and server was absolutely horrendous, I can tell you that the service here is the exact opposite!  WE have very attentive service, from the host, the waitress, to the big guy checking on us.  I mean, I felt like I was at a five star dining service or flying first class on Singapore Airlines.  It was just right. \n\nIn the end, we were so happy with the food, the service, the experience, we actually ordered two more dishes for take out. We are thinking about sharing this with the kids who were out with friends while we were basking in the glories of tonkatsu delight.\n\nThree - That is how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop!"

I pass by this intersection every day and didn't think twice about going by here until by recommendation from some classmates.\n\nSo I head down the street, park up front, and enter to find this seemingly simple designed eatery. Nothing grand. A simple bar. Maybe enough seats for 30? It's small. The menu itself is simple too! It's a front and back menu which focuses on mainly katsu. I was really curious at this point.\n\nI order a chicken katsu at around $9 and my boyfriend the salmon/chicken katsu close to $14. It's a really good portion of food. You get a salad with dressing. Katsu fried in flakey japanese style breading that has a satisfying crisp. I think some Japanese pickles (which I didn't try) and a miso soup. The miso soup was a thoughtful touch. I could never finish a whole order by myself and I went here twice!\n\nOverall, I ended up having a pocket in my heart for this place. The restaurant is simple, not because it doesn't put effort, but because their showcase is really their food. It has personality to it that is unique to Tonkatsu. Service has always been friendly there too like we're all just neighbors.\n\nNote: I'm often a budget eater so $9 for chicken katsu was like, \"Eh..\" but after trying it, I say it's a reasonable price especially if comparing it to a $6.50 hawaiian bbq regular plate because you can account for the salad and miso soup...plus the breading of the chicken was delicious at this place. It definitely converted what I thought katsu should taste like."

Immediately, we noticed a jar of sesame seeds along with katsu sauce on the table.  Then we were given a mortar and pestle, which was different yet intriguing.  We asked what we were supposed to do with it, and we were told that we can grind up the sesame seeds for extra texture to our sauce.  Our little one enjoyed doing that, of course.  Husband ordered the Hire Katsu and Eby Fry Dinner, and I ordered the Tori Katsu and Eby Fry Dinner.  The sauce with the ground up sesame seeds were also a great addition to the flavor!  Presentation was great, but taste was even better.  The katsu was light and crunchy, not overly saturated with oil, or dense with panko.  Definitely a great place to go if you're looking for great katsu."

While there's certainly no market for upscale $30+ tonkatsu meals on the corner of Jones and Robindale, Tonkatsu Kiyoshi does a decent job of breading, frying and serving meat.  They're definitely the best around...since they're the only place around!!\n\nMy wife got the hire (pork) katsu dinner which was better than the ebi (shrimp) katsu.  The shrimp was quite large which was a plus.  I went with the ebi just to have a variety but I should have just gotten the other pork option (Rosu).  After all, there's a pig on the freakin sign so that should give you some hints on what to order.  The meal comes with miso soup, rice and a little onion.  \n\nAfter you grind the sesame seeds, transfer the amount you'd like into the black dish with the sauce, don't put the sauce directly into the grinding bowl.  That's the wrong way to do it and you limit the size of the piece you dip by using the small bowl.  I noticed several people doing this while we were there.    \n\nThe quality of their pork is better than Japanese Curry Zen and they give a substantial amount more.  I plan on trying the katsu curry next time for sure and I'll be ready to bump it up a star or two if the curry is great."

Mix your own sesame/Katsu sauce, put the spicy mustard in for a unique flavor unlike any Katsu sauce out there. The Hire-Katsu meal is perfect for lunch. Paired with either iced matcha(green tea) or oolong(barley) tea, the meal as a whole is so refreshing and not overwhelmingly filling. \n\nAnd! They have Asahi \"black\"!

Exceptional customer service with delicious menu items will have me coming back for more! \n\nDuring my visit, we ordered Hire (pork tenderloin) katsu & Ebi fry ($16), Tori (chicken) katsu & Ebi fry ($14), Rosu (thick cut pork loin) katsu ($12), Takoyaki ($5), Deep fried spam musubi ($3.50), and Kaki (oyster) fry ($5). With your yelp check-in, you can either choose between an order of potato salad or seaweed salad for free! We chose to try the potato salad.\n\nAll of the katsu dishes were fried to perfection and did not have an overly thick crust. The chicken and pork cutlets were tender and juicy. They have the best katsu I've had in Vegas so far! Other places I've tried tend to overcook their katsu resulting in a dry cutlet. Another nice touch is that you can grind up sesame seed to your liking and mix it with the katsu sauce! The ebi fry tasted great! Large prawns are fried in a light crispy batter resulting in a nice crunch. Two came with the combo plate and was more than enough!\n\nThe takoyaki was pretty straight forward. Nothing to rave about, but was good nonetheless. \n\nFour words...DEEP FRIED SPAM MUSUBI. The proportion of spam to rice was well balanced and was great with the crunch from the panko batter.  Everyone at the table loved this appetizer and will be a staple to order on our next visit!   \n\nThe kaki fry came with three to an order and was nice and juicy. \n\nOverall, I'm glad to have found this place as it will be my go-to when the cravings kick in for katsu!!

I recommend that you ask for a bit of karashi for you katsu. \n\nHere is the breakdown of the eats:\n\nKaraage: legit Japanese!\nRosu Katsu: legit Japanese!\nCurry: Homestyle legit Japanese!\n\nI don't know how to explain it any better. If you want REAL Japanese katsu, come here!\n\nFor those of you who are hesitant on giving this place a try, think of it this way; when you want a quick burger you go to McDonalds, when you want a good quality burger you go to _______________ (insert favorite burger boutique name here). This is the same thought process you should use when debating over katsu. If you want quick food; go to L&L.

She says, \"Use this and make your own sauce.\"  One was filled w toasted sesame while the other contained a sweet savory tangy Japanese bbq type sauce usually used w Tonkatsu or other fried foods.  So I took the pestle w one hand and scooped a mini ladle full of sesame into my little mortar w the other.  Mid way thru the grinding, the earthy and peanutty aroma began to release, caressing my appetite.  What a pleasant way to start my lunch.\n\nMy long awaited curry finally came my way.  The colors n the smell of curry was enough to make me throw my face into it... What etiquette?  None.   That first spoonful of fluffy japanese rice smothered in curry and crispy Panko crusted porkchop aka tonkatsu w a golden creamy runny yolk just made my entire day.  It was only a matter of minutes that I realized the plate was empty.  The struggle between being stuffed and wishing there was more.  The struggle was real.  \n\nAlthough on the pricey side I feel at 19 bucks after adding an egg n tips, it was a very solid plate of Japanese comfort.  Writing this review just made me want to go get some curry for lunch... Ok I'm getting curry for lunch."

It wasn't horror film status, but enough to have to continue swatting them away just so they won't land on my food.. Fruit flies flying around is a sign of not enough cleaning or rotting food somewhere. Debating on calling the Health Department on this place, as that was completely disgusting. Employees were also aware of the fruit flies. One noted that she noticed it in the morning when she came in.. Did not seem to bother them."

Great appetizer! \n\nI ordered the Chicken Katsu. If Tonkatsu had a really good dressing for their cabbage salad that comes with the katsu... it would be perfect! The ginger dressing doesn't really go well with it. The katsu itself was really GOOD! It reminded me of Wako, a really popular Katsu place in Los Angeles\n\nService was also awesome! The waiter recommended this tasty melon soda float for dessert. Never had anything like it. Kinda like a root beer float but instead of root beer, its melon soda!"

Salad dressing seemed to be a yuzu (lemony) based, it was fresh, crisp, and clean with finely shopped cabbage salad (the thinner the better IMO!). I got the pork tonkatsu and shrimp combo, super crispy but still moist! Their tonkatsu sauce also improved, it was too sweet before and not it has that little tangy bite to it which is what I love about a good tonkatsu sauce. \n\nI was super pleased with the improvement in service and food, can't wait to go again!"

The potato salad had the right amount of dashi and sweetness,  chicken karaagi was slightly salty for my taste.

It made me think that I didn't know where exceptional katsu was and behold - I came home and this was newly opened! Wishes answered! \n\nThe BF and I got the Hire (pork tenderloin) and the Rosu (thick cut pork loin) to compare the two tonkatsu offerings. We both liked the hire better which is thinner sliced, a bit more tender and had more crunch to meat ratio. The rosu is good if you like a meatier, pork chop type cut. If pork isn't your thing, they have seafood and chicken katsu offerings.\n\nEach meal comes with thin shaved cabbage with a refreshing yuzu dressing, lovely sticky rice, rakkyo pickles, and a stronger than average miso soup. It makes for a simple and comforting meal. I thought the portions were good as we were both comfortably full. Your katsu sauce is a interactive type thing. You grind your sesame seeds and mix with the katsu sauce to your liking from a tray on your table. I don't know if it is homemade sauce, but I thought it was balanced flavor. \n\nService was friendly and decent. There was chatter of Japanese patrons enjoying their meal which was comforting. It definitely is one of the better katsu to be had in this city, quite on par with some favorites I have outside of Vegas. Most definitely will be back!"

So off I went to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi based on the great Yelp reviews.  \n\nIf you like tonkatsu, you will really enjoy this place. The tonkatsu is lightly breaded and crisp, yet not greasy, and the meat is fresh and moist. On my first bite, I could tell that the quality of the meat was high. The tonkatsu dipping sauce tasted home made and was flavorful, and much better than the store bought variety. Although the dinner portion is not large, the meal came with red miso soup that was made with high quality red miso and seaweed. It also came with thinly sliced cabbage with a light ponzu salad dressing. I also had the kara age that was excellent as well.\n\nOverall, an excellent meal that was fairly priced for the quality of the ingredients."

It should not remain overlooked.\n\nI was in the mood for something comforting today. With plenty of fried goodness, the menu at Tonkatsu Kiyoshi is pretty much Japanese comfort food. It's also not too far from some of my favorite sweets spots on Rainbow Blvd, which is always a good thing.\n\nThe first thing you do after ordering is load up your sauce bowl with sesame seeds from one of the hexagonal containers at the table, grab your pestle, and start grinding away. When you're satisfied with the amount of sesame powder, ladle katsu sauce from the other table and stir (probably with chopsticks). Eat this mixture with your katsu, or just nibble on it while waiting for whatever else you've ordered.\n\nTakoyaki ($5): best rendition I've had yet. These morsels are served hot but not scalding hot, and they has that crispy exterior, soft interior, and chewy yet tender octopus. The bonito flakes and the creamy and sweet sauces complete the delicious flavor profile.\n\nAgedashi Tofu ($4): my friend's pick from the several side dishes. Nice soft tofu and miso broth, but the skin is overly chewy. Note that it's not straightforward to share this dish because it's one big cube of tofu.\n\nHire Katsu ($13): a nice portion of breaded, fried pork tenderloin, served with miso soup, rice, thinly shredded cabbage with what seemed like a ponzu sauce, a dab of wasabi, and some pickled pearl onions. The katsu itself is a bit bland, but it's obviously meant to be eaten with the sauce and sides and contributes all the meatiness and crunch that you could want in that comprehensive mouthful. The cabbage was refreshing and the ponzu was so useful. I missed that in my first visit because the donburi lacks it entirely. It's a great entree for a big lunch or as part of dinner.\n\nMy friend is already planning to go back to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi tomorrow, and I'm sure I'll be around significantly more often. It's an excellent katsu restaurant and is worth the drive even without its proximity to some of my other frequent stops."

Every time I decided to go to Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, it happened to be a Sunday. Haha Just my luck right? Luckily, this time it was a Thursday. \n\nParking is never an issue in Las Vegas. This location had their own parking lot. It was not pack at the time I went.\n\nThe atmosphere inside the store was very causal. I like that there was a Daruma good luck doll. I saw a bunch of those when I went to Hawaii so I thought they was cool that they had a huge one there. They have a \"bar\" seating area and 6 tables inside the restaurant. Five tables were seated but it didn't feel PACKED. The place is small with can hold a good amount of people without feeling crowded. \n\nThere was only one service and two people in the kitchen. The server was quiet for the most part. He would just take our order and it took him a while to refill our water. When I went to pay my bill, he was very friendly and joked around a little.\n\nThe food was the main reason why I rated this place 2 stars. I ordered the Tonkatsu Don. Although the slice of pork was thick, it was very dry. There was nothing special about that dish. We also order the Chicken Karaage which was $6. There was only 6 pieces of meat and they were pretty small. I can't believe I paid $1 per piece of chicken. There was nothing special about the Chicken Karaage either. I felt like I could live without it and regretted my order. We got the Melon Float as well which is a drink I could make on my own. \n\nIf you're looking for a very good Tonkatsu Don, I recommend going to I-Naba. The location of the restaurant is a little weird but I guarantee their food is good and very authentic! :)"

Let a lone restaurants who were doing specific Items really well. Tonkatsu (pork cutlet, Panko breaking and deep friend served with a dipping sauce) is one of my favorite japanese comfort foods and a dish that my mother does very well. \n\nThe owner/chef goes to the market every morning to pick up ingredients for the day. No frozen meat or left overs from the day before. This shows in the quality of the pork and the freshness of the greens. The tonkatsu is cooked perfectly and the pork is tender, not chewy like you may find at some hawaiian plate lunch places or lesser quality japanese restaurants. For the sauce, they recommend grinding up sesame seeds at ur table and mixing it with the sauce. I've never had it this way before and I'm now a huge fan. For their salad dressing they made an in house ume boshi and ponzu sauce. Two of my favorite flavors. When ever I'm in the area I make sure to stop in or take out. \n\nLikes: superb quality, family owned, friendly service, fresh ingredients\n\nDislike: it's not 24hrs lol"

On the critical side, their tonkatsu sauce is quite salty and it would be tough to counter that with the options on the table. The cutlets themselves were moist and well cooked, though the breading was a little plain in flavor.\n\nThe dinner portion came with rice and miso soup, which were ok but decent.\n\nOne thing that felt awkward to me is that the store was eerily quiet despite there being about a dozen people there when we got there.

Since they only serve tonkatsu, they do this really well.\n\nWe have  only tried Hawaiian style tonkatsu but this place has a different take on their tonkatsu, they serve it with grounded sesame seed with tonkatsu sauce, the cabbage that comes along with tongkatsu is splendid, its a nice pairing of deep fried meats and salad with ginger miso dressing. \n\nThis place is definitely   must try."

All dishes were delicious!  Super light and crispy katsu crusts on every dish, and not at all oily or soggy!  The generous portions and fresh side of cabbage salad was a perfect compliment.  Nice miso soup with the meal.\n\nThe lunch crowd was not super busy, and our servers were extremely friendly and helpful.  I love it when they offer up some unsolicited guidance on mixing the ingredients to compliment your dish.  Even if you think you know what you're doing, it's a nice extra step to get the recommendations from the experts.\n\nThe restaurant was super clean and nicely adorned with just a few touches that made it feel very comfortable and welcoming.\n\nAs we were tending to our bills, the waitress informed us of some specials that were upcoming in the week and shared some photos of the dishes they specialize in that are not on the menu, whilst giving a little background on the chefs origins and why they choose certain dishes to prepare.  On our first visit, they made us feel like regulars.\n\nGreat little place!  Will definitely be back!"

As far as the tonkatsu, I've only had the hire tonkatsu (pork loin). I don't know how they tenderize the cutlet (or even if they do), but it's incredibly tender without sacrificing texture like marinating can do. \n\nTheir ebi katsu are very large black tiger shrimp - we joke they are size U1. The shrimp is also fried to perfection.\n\nToday, a creamy crab croquette was a special. It was full of crab and very creamy, but I don't know how they fried it so perfectly that the insides weren't spilling out everywhere. Like I said, they are fry masters.\n\nBut what totally takes it over the top is the self-service katsu sauce. I like tons of sesame seeds ground to a rough paste before dumping their version of Bulldog sauce. The sesame seeds adds an incredibly nutty flavor and texture. \n\nI believe most of the meals come with rice, miso soup, and a gargantuan mound of finely shredded cabbage to make it seem like you're not eating everything to raise your cholesterol and clog arteries. Their rakkyo (pickled scallions) is good as well.\n\nHands down. Best tonkatsu in town."

My boyfriend ordered the cutlet with cabbage, and two sides of miso soup as a substitute for white rice. That cutlet was breaded to perfection. Every bite was warm and crunchy.

I like how they give you the chance to grind your own toasted sesame seeds to either mix with a tonkatsu sauce or place directly on top of your food.  \nThe tonkatsu sauce was pretty strong but good as long as you get some rice in that mouthful.  Also ordered the potato salad and it was excellent.  Unlike many potato salads, it was light and refreshing as opposed to heavy.  She puts cured cucumbers and, I think, some apply pieces in there.  In any case, it was a nice side to go along with the breaded and fried meat.\nCurry had a little potato and carrot too.  Would have loved to see a side of corn.  I usually roll like that.

There was one group of 4 waiting for a table ahead of us, but we were able to squeeze into a seat at the bar. The decor and atmosphere of the tiny restaurant did not seem thought out too well. I think the main turn off was how incredibly bright the place was. I think if there's one major detail to dining out, it's good lighting. The waitress was handling all the checks at the bar, and there was really no separation between the back counter and the bar, so that was a little odd too. We could see the employees personal things piled on a chair in front, along with what looked like a bug zapper. Weird. There was also a basket of pens and crap on the bar too, which I think was a little distracting at first. \n\nWe ordered the edamame and beef tataki to start. The beef tataki was served with shredded onions and citrus ponzu that I mixed with grated daikon. I really enjoyed that. So good. \n\nFor dinner I ordered the Tonkatsu and shrimp combo which is a pretty good deal, considering it comes with miso, rice, shredded cabbage salad and pickled onions. It's a good size portion as well. You mixed your own katsu sauce too at the table (which is basically just grinding sesame seeds, then poring in Tonkatsu sauce) The shrimp was huge too, like prawn size. And they lay the fried katsu meats on a wire rack to keep it crispy, which is always a good thing. I thought my meal was delicious and worth the $16 that it cost. \n\nMy bf orders the katsu curry, which came with miso, rice, curry and katsu. He devoured his dish so it must have been tasty. \n\nFor dessert, we got the green tea cheesecake, which was good too, but a lot of Japanese restaurants carry that as a dessert item. I was happy with the meal, just wish they could create a better ambiance by fixing that damn lighting."

            "review": "Krazy for Katsu\nThere are some days where comfort food makes everything better.  I was not in the mood for meatloaf or some heavy fried chicken, even though I was dying for fried food.  On the way home, we stumbled on a small eatery called Tonkatsu Kiyoshi on Jones and Robindale.  Tonkatsu sounded wonderful for dinner.  Crispy, marinated, fried pork was just the thing to make my frown turn upside-down.\n\nUpon entering the small eatery, there are about 3 tables that seat up to six people, and a nice, large counter seating 5.  We sat at the counter and was greeted by a very nice gentleman who explained the menu layout.  The menu is very simple--it's katsu, either chicken, salmon, thick cut pork, or pork tenderloin, ebi furai, curry combos, and apps.  The appetizers are the typical karaage, cucumber and krab meat salad, seared beef with onions and ponzu, and edamame.  We ordered karaage, krab meat salad, and seared beef.\n\nBefore the food arrived, the server explained their sauce tray seated in front of us.  There is a container of sesame seeds, one of katsu sauce, hot pepper, salt, pepper, and soy sauce.\n\n\nWe were told to put sesame in the grinding bowl that doubles as our dipping sauce bowl, and to grind the sesame seeds to a powder.\n\nIt was quite fun grinding up the sesame seeds and taking in the scent of the nutty oils releasing in the bowl.  We mixed in the katsu sauce and some hot pepper with our chopsticks, then awaited the main course.\n\nThe apps came out quickly.  First up was the cucumber salad with krab meat.  It's sweet and tangy from the vinegar, balancing the sweetness of the shredded krab stick.  The cucumber was a nice, crunchy, and fresh element to the app.  It also acts as a great palate cleanser.\n\nFor $5 you get a ton of salad.  I almost ate the whole bowl without sharing with my husband.\n\nThe next app that arrived was the seared beef with onions and ponzu.  We were told that some people like to roll the onions into the meat then dip, which I tried.\n\nI added in the radish (on the right) and some chives into the sauce, rolled the raw white onions in the meat, then dipped.  It was delicious and very cold, which was refreshing.  The meat was good quality and seared beautifully.\n\nIf there is anything in the world I love, it is fried chicken or karaage, and this eatery makes the lightest, crispiest, and most flavorful karaage I have tried in Vegas.  They marinate the meat in mirin, soy, and other ingredients for a day or two, then they lightly batter it with seasoned rice flour and serve with a vinaigrette salad and lemon.  I squeezed lemon over the chicken, gently dropped soy on each piece, and took a bite.  The crispy, light exterior was just heaven.  The salad on the side balanced the hot fried chicken pieces, providing tasty, cool relief from the hot and crispy chicken.  \n\n\nWith a burst of cherry tomato in my mouth mixed in with the salad, this could be a great lunch dish on its own.  Just lovely.\n\nAfter all those appetizers came the combination plate that I ordered -- fried shrimp with tenderloin katsu.  It's served with Rokkyo (Japanese pickled onions), miso soup, hot rice, and ponzu for the cabbage.\n\nThe katsu is served on this awesome metal rack to keep all sides crispy.\n\nThe katsu was juicy and crispy, with that lovely coating that wasn't too thick.  The shrimp (ebi furai) was delicious.  I love ebi furai and they make it very well here.  With the cabbage covered in ponzu sauce, some Rokkyo to cut through the richness of the katsu, and some hot rice to compliment everything else, I didn't look up once through the entire meal.  It was just so much fun to dip in the katsu sesame sauce and then reach for rice, then drink some miso to balance everything.  In the end, I raped my plate of all its parts and tapped my tummy in approval.\n\nBut what--we cannot end a meal on entree alone.  A light, sweet dessert is required here, and what better to eat than a cream puff.  A cream puff that is made fresh, powdered with sugar, and filled generously with a whipped cream made in-house was the perfect way to end this \"ichiban\" meal.  The cream was silky and had just the right sweetness, with a puff that wasn't crispy as it was chewy and light.  Perfect ending to my day, indeed.\n\nAfter paying the good man $56 for 2 drinks. 2 entress, 3 apps, and 2 desserts, my husband and I shuffled our cartoon-like full bellies into the car and headed home to hibernate.  I love places that have simple menus, provide good food and service, are very clean, and are priced well.  Tonkatsu Kiyoshi hits all those marks, which only means that they are on my go-to list when I am in dire need of a katsu, karaage, or ebi furai mix.  Thank you, Tonkatsu Kiyoshi, for making my day brighter and my belly full."

Portions were larger on the pork, but the chicken portion was still more than adequate.  The bread crumbs were crisp and the meat was cooked just right (not over or under cooked).  The miso soup was solid and the seaweed salad was perfect (fresh, crunchy, great dressing).  The sesame that you grind on the spot for yourself added a fresh flavor to the excellent tonkatsu sauce.  Great value (under $30 for two for lunch).  Meredith, the owner, was very attentive and really cares about her customers and the food quality.   Try it!"

            "review": "My sister and I were debating between restaurants and finally settled on Tonkatsu Kiyoshi. We took a little long in deciding and ended up arriving at 9:55- they close at 10. I really didn't want to be THAT jerk, but I was so set on katsu at this point that I poked my head in and asked if they were still open and they graciously gave us a table. The owners here are from Hawaii and the service definitely reflects that- genuine, helpful, and you can tell they take pride in what they're putting out.\n\nThe potato salad we started with was more vinegary than I'm used to for Japanese style, but delicious nonetheless. It was smooth with cubes of crisp apple and cucumber throughout, and distinctly eggy from the shredded egg lacing through it.\n\nThe katsu was a work of art, truly. Perfectly cooked cal rose rice with crispy golden sliced katsu over the top. My sister had the chicken and ebi combo while I opted for the katsu curry. Miso soup comes with all meals here, and it was definitely a robust version. \nThe chicken and shrimp came with cabbage salad with Yuzu to dress it on the side, as well as some pickled shallots. The cabbage salad was a perfect fresh compliment to the crunchy fried katsu goodness. Everything was cooked perfectly and the shrimp were gigantic and absolutely incredible! The menu stated that they use black tiger prawns and they weren't kidding.\nThe katsu curry was very flavorful and the curry itself was thick and could stand up on its own. This dish came simply with pickled ginger and was enormous! All portions here are enough to make two meals out of, unless the katsu is so overwhemingly addicting that you just eat until you pseudo-hate yourself.\n\nBeing that it was my first time here, I was a noob to the whole sauce bit. I've never ground my own sesame for katsu sauce, it's just always arrived with my meal! The waitress saw me and came over to explain how it worked and got it started for me. She also had to open my bottle of Ramune for me =( A+ for service, but next time I come in I'll be pro!"

Service was great & our server was great about explaining how to mix some of the food items. For example, they provide you with sesame seeds, a small grind bowl, and katsu sauce and BAM! you end up w/ a fantastic katsu sauce. I went with the traditional katsu chicken, but the menu was full of katsu curries and other seafood items. \n\nIf you get the side of Japanese mustard in your meal, which you can add to the katsu sauce, I have to warn you,  put too much and the katsu sauce is too hot. Kind of like wasabi. Some of the plates come as a combo meal, unless you have a hefty appetite or plan on sharing w/someone else, I do not recommend getting the combo plate- its alot of food. The regular plates come w/alot as well. Food was tasteful and unique in style, I will def come again."

There was no language barrier, he just seemed entertained with the people he seemed to know instead of dealing with other customers. \n\nHe came over about 10minutes after seating us and asked us what we wanted to  order. Explained to him that this was the first time here so we didn't know what to do with the sesame seeds and sauce. \n\nInstead of explaining it, he just put everything into the grinding bowls and started to do it with no smile on his face. \n\nStill this seemed like a cute place so we can overlook the depressing man. We ordered our food and it was good and tasteful. The Donbari, I believe it was called, was flavorful and had a thick cut of pork so worth it.\n\nService was the thing that knocked this down the furthest. We had to wait FOREVER for our check and then had to called them over to remind them to bring it back... Such a good concept just disapointed in the service. Also, more sauce options would be fantastic."

The sauce with freshly grounded sesame really elevates this dish.  The curry was deep and yummy.\n\n#katsu donburi:  the egg was delish and made just right not over cooked at all.  Only wish was that they added a bit more sauce to the rice. \n\n#melon float:  great pricing at $3.75.  Melon soda was interesting not bad but I wasn't a big fan. \n\nParking:  free in the large lot\n\nOverall we had a great time. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced.

It's not on the menu but usually written as a special on a board. The chicken katsu has a light crispy breaded outside and juicy inside to it! The chicken is quite lean compared to other places. The katsu comes served on top of a rack so it doesn't get soggy. It isn't oily either. This place reminds me of wako in LA. They're really careful with packing their takeout as well. The katsu curry is all packaged together in the same box with different compartments and after 20min of driving on the freeway, no spills and none of the rice or cutlet touched the curry. They wrap the entire box in plastic and place the cutlet on top of the rice and it doesn't fall... Yes, I'm quite impressed just by that. All in all, this is my go to spot besides curry zen. I prefer this place more though. Portion sizes are smaller than most other places but hey.. Quality over quantity!"

It's inside of a strip mall in a quiet, residential neighborhood. Definite must-try if you are in this area, which is kinda far from the Strip.\n\nThe first thing you do when you sit down is grind your own sesame seeds to make your dipping sauce. The mortar-and-pestle workout I call it. Then add katsu sauce to your creation.\n\nWe tried the panko crusted soft shell crab to start and it was excellent.  The shrimp and chicken katsu dinner was not at all greasy and very tasty. I think having the katsu rest and served  on a metal grate keeps it from getting soggy.  It comes out light and crispy.   I don't think you can go wrong with ordering any of the katsu they offer.\n\nThe staff is friendly and the prices are alright in my book. When we left the ipod was playing Shai. Are you serious?!

We were actually looking for an Italian restaurant, and close by was more of a pizza place, not so much pasta. \n\nTonkatsu Kiyoshi is definitely a hidden gem. It is next to the Euphoria Wellness dispensary. It is a small family owned restaurant. They have bar style seating along with normal restaurant seating. They have a specials board and a normal menu. Their menu ranges from $5-$18. \n\nThey literally have the best katsu in Las Vegas that I've tried so far. Depending on how I am feeling I either get the Chicken katsu or one of the tonkatsu. It's a hefty serving! It comes with rice and salad. The salad is just shredded cabbage but whatever the dressing is made out of is the best! It pairs well with the katsu! You also get a side of miso soup and a little pickled shallots. Everything is so good. You also get to make your sauce with the tonkatsu sauce and crushed sesame seeds. \n\nThe tonkatsu donburi is my second favorite. When I order food to go or for pick up, I always get the donburi mostly because if I ordered the normal katsu, it might get soggy. The Donburi is really good! It also comes with the miso soup. Make sure you try it out! \n\nThe melon soda float makes for a drink/dessert. Just saying!\n\nOh and the service is great!!!"

Cool idea but the germaphobe in me got a little creeped out by all the possible sharing of germs that happens during this process since you spoon out the seeds/sauce rather than shake/squeeze out..

The chicken katsu was juicy and tender and like I mentioned before the breading was on point. The shredded cabbage salad comes with ponzu dressing which was ok but fills you up without eating the rice. \n-Chicken Katsu with Curry ($12) Comes with miso soup, pickled ginger, rice, 1 chicken katsu breast and curry. The curry has some potatoes and carrots but tastes like something out of a box. I say skip the Katsu Curry plate and just get the Katsu plate because you get more katsu, you get salad & it's cheaper!!! \n\nService was friendly. Food took about 10 minutes to come out.

The finely shaved mountain of cabbage with a light and delicate yuzu (Japanese citrus) dressing is a perfect accompaniment to the meat.\n\nIf you have room, try one of the homemade desserts, beautifully prepared by Kiyoshi's wife.  Today, I had the raspberry yuzu panecotta, and it was the bomb!\n\nIn addition to delicious food, the restaurant is decorated with homey Japanese touches that make it a very comfortable place to enjoy one of the tastiest comfort foods of Japan--warm woods, good luck cats, and homey framed artwork.\n\nThis is the perfect example of a restaurant that has chosen one dish to excel in.

My daughter said the edamame was great. \n\nAs we waited for the entree he taught us how to make our own Katsu dipping sauce with sesame seeds.

As a frequent visitor to tonkatsu spots during my business trips to Japan, it was an amazing feeling walking into Tonkatsu Kiyoshi and being presented with the traditional mortar and pestle to grind my own sesame seeds. \n\nThe tonkatsu here is excellent - the pork is juicy while the breading is light and perfectly crispy - very well executed. I usually get the katsu curry, which comes with a sizable amount of rice and curry. Don't forget the sides like the Japanese-style potato salad and the wonderful melon cream soda with ice cream.\n\nI don't live anywhere near this place, but it is well worth the trip. Thanks again, Yelpers!"

First you start of by making your own sauce, and grinding the sesame seeds with the Katsu sauce which was very creative. \n\nThe plate combo was served with miso Soup, cabbage, rice, and pickeled baby onion. Everything on my plate balanced very well for my appetite. This place is my favorite and will come back again soon. Would love to try their salmon and big tiger prawn Katsu next time !"

I came here wanting to try something new because I liked YuYu so much and it seemed similar.\n\nThis new restaurant is super cute with a lot of wood furniture, table top seating, and a bar area to sit at. \n\nThey specialize in fried foods! Their main menu up front has pork katsu, salmon katsu, and chicken katsu platters on the front side and you can do the same platters with a fried shrimp for a couple bucks more. They start at like $12 and end at $16 and come with a salad and miso soup.\n\nToday I chose the pork katsu don which is a bowl with a bunch of sauce, grilled onions, and an egg on top. It was a big portion for a bowl which I was glad about. The meat was a bit over cooked in my opinion but the flavors were there. \n\nWe had karaage, fried squid, takoyaki, sausage as appetizers. The takoyaki and squid legs were awesome! \n\nThe food was really good. I didn't finish the bowl. The only thing I didn't like was the karaage. I like a more breaded karaage. \n\nFor all of those appetizers, two drinks, two entrees, and 4 appetizers we spent $50. I thought it was a good price. The service was good."

I am not sure if it is store policy, but the waiter offered to refill our rice and cabbage salad during our visit.\n\nMy combination chicken and shrimp katsu was only $14.

THAT is not real tonkatsu. It should be light, moist, crispy, and flavorful. That is exactly what you get here. They have different options such as pork, chicken and salmon. They also have curry tonkatsu, which is what I ordered. Omg. It was amazing. The curry was so flavorful and creamy while the pork tonkatsu underneath was light and tender. They also give you a mortar and pestle which I was a bit confused about since the waitress did not explain what it was for, but with a quick glance around the dining room, I realized that it was to crush the sesame seeds for the tonkatsu sauce! It was actually a bit fun to do because honestly, how often do you get to grind sesame seeds?! The katsu sauce was amazing as well. \n\nI seriously crave their tonkatsu every day because it's soooo scrumptious.

There are six tables and a bar-type area for seating. You're welcomed immediately with a nice \"Irrashaimase!\" and it sounds like they've practiced because the pronounciation sounded almost native Japanese. The tables are a good size and the seats are comfy. In the middle of the table is a nice set up where you can mix up your own tonkatsu sauce and roasted sesame seeds. Pretty damn brilliant.\n\nFor starters we got the karaage chicken and beef tataki. Excellent dishes. The presentation and portioning are just right, and so is the price. For the main course, I had the Hire & Ebi combo and let me tell you, the breading and texture were just like back home in Japan. The presentation was just like you'd walked into a tonkatsu place in Shinjuku or Yokohama. These guys pulled it off legit. To finish things off, you must, MUST try their yuzu pannacotta. Get there early and order it quick, because they'll sell out. \n\nOverall, it was a 5 star yelp experience. It's rare that I go to a place twice in a week, let alone 2 days in a row.

We came back here today (our third time in a month, so that says a lot lol), and once again the food was perfection, and the service even more so. Last time we were there, the owner (?) lady was so personable and even showed us how to properly open our ramune, and also carefully explained all the dishes. Today was no exception as she was, once again, ever so nice.  She took the time to go to each table to see how everyone was liking their food, and made it a point to know that we were satisfied with or dishes. I really can't get enough of this place. Delicious food and great service all around. So glad I found this place. Thanks, tonkatsu kiyoshi! We will be back for more :)"

You get two big pork cutlets with a standard order. They are fork-tender and served on a little rack to prevent sogginess and ensure maximum crispiness! They also offer a combo plate for a couple bucks more which comes with 2 cutlets plus 2 giant crispy, tender shrimp. And did I mention that every main course comes with miso soup and white rice as well? I really enjoyed the tonkatsu & japanese curry, which adds a nice mild spice to the dish.\n\nA unique part of the meal is the grind-you-own sesame seeds for the \"bbq\" sauce. The sesame seeds mellow out the flavor of the sauce, which starts out a bit tangy like A1 + BBQ Sauce + Worcestershire Sauce. As you customize the flavor to your liking, it's fun to have different people at the table all tweak their sauces differently then share and compare.\n\nOn a final note, they have a nice selection of appetizers in the $3-6 range and authentic Japanese tea (Asahi beer coming soon!). 2 people, 2 apps, 2 drinks, the 2 biggest entrees, and 2 full & happy customers came to $40. Fast and attentive service and unbelievable food has put this restaurant on my \"must visit\" list. I've already recommended it to everybody that I know!"

Nice size portions for the price.      I have to admit that it was better then my mother in law's, who has been cooking Katsu since her days in Japan and Hawaii.  Loved the potato salad and shishito peppers.   Great service, very friendly staff, and food arrived quickly.  Highly recommend this place!"

We were happy, considering we just finished a Red Rock hike, and it would've been a little disappointing to have bad food after. But no disappointments here.

It doesn't seem too crazy or out of the ordinary but it adds the uniqueness of dining here. \nTheir katsu is top knotch, good portions and very tasty. The menu isn't overwhelming and whenever I read it, it's easy to make a decision. Prices are average and actually decent for the quality and portion you receive.\n\nStaff are always welcoming and friendly. My first visit was quite enjoyable. I came here with my girflriend for a nice dinner. We sat at the \"bar(don't think there is alcohol served here)\" and our waiter asked if we've ever ate here. We replied \"no,\" and he showed us what to do with the sesame seeds and sauce. We had a good time, as simple as it was. We had a fun conversation with our waiter too.\n\nWhenever I eat here, I tend to always order the chicken and shrimp katsu. yumm I haven't eaten here in a month or two and the more I think about it right now it makes me hungry.\n\n5/5 for all around good experiences for every visit and great consistent food and service."

I've had some amazing karage in Vegas and this one fell short of my expectations. I preferred the side salad this is plated with to the actual dish.\nTAKO SUNOMONO: Octopus and cucumber salad. This was perfect for the hot Vegas day, light and refreshing with a light dressing.\nBEEF TATAKI: $7 for 9 tiny strips, served on a bed of radish with ponzu sauce. Pretty good flavor, liked the dipping sauce with daikon. Small portion is shareable but barely so.\nCHICKEN KATSU SLIDERS: Ordered this because I saw another diner eating the across the room and it ended up being my favorite dish. Two fresh Hawaiian rolls with a halved chicken katsu cutlet and a tasty wasabi-infused sauce.  \n\nService was basic. I like that they have iced green tea available as a beverage. Receipt is hand-written list with the total at the bottom, tax was obviously included but not written out, would prefer an itemized receipt. Our total seemed higher than it should have been. I will come back for the katsu donburi, looks to be the best dish."

Can't go wrong with Shishito Peppers to start out your meal.  Starving?  Go for the combination of Hire (perfectly breaded crispy pork breasts) and Shrimp (colossal tiger prawns) Katsu Dinner.  For fifteen bucks, the meal comes with rice, miso soup, salad, and pickled pearl onions... definitely worth it.  Dope how their customers also get to grind their own sesame seeds to add for the sauce. \n\nGot to try Katsu Curry last time I was here.  Flavor wasn't bad but there are better ones elsewhere.  Make sure to get extra ginger on the side if you do end up getting it though.\n\nOverall, Tonkatsu Kyoshi is one of the better katsu houses in the valley.

Obviously compared to authentic tonkatsu found in Japan it's not going to be quite to standard.  The cuts of the pork were too lean.   Would have been nice if the portions of the cutlets were a bit larger. The rice was not Japanese rice (authentic Japanese rice with tonkatsu is key in my opinion), and the potato salad was what you could find at a supermarket.  The miso was so-so.  They charge for hot tea which was very surprising since it was lukewarm and not particularly of high quality.  Typically a tonkatsu place would not charge for basic hot tea.  All in all, it's fine, a bit pricier than I expected.\n\nService was friendly but the place was understaffed.  It may be one of the better katsu places in Vegas but Vegas is not really a hotbed for Japanese cuisine so it's all relative. I find the katsu here about the same as served at Yu-Yu."

I am not big on cabbage that gets served with it, so they actually let me customize my order and exchange for more rice instead! Customer service is good, i think its because the owner tries to make it a point to always greet their customers coming and going, only one comment though, the single server that is working the shift kind of moves too slow and fails to acknowledge you if you need anything else, but hey that was only one time. Also the only thing that irks me a little is that they open your can of soda and pour it in a glass for you, which is just not my preference, but hey i wont let that spoil my party! I definitely will go back to this place, it is definitely worth the drive just so i can taste the best tonkatsu in las vegas! And as a cherry on top, prices are reasonable as well!"

KOtsu is bone as in pork bone broth you make Ramen out of, so please get it straight.  Katsu NOT Kotsu.  \n\nWhen I was in Japan this spring I must have had 3 or 4 tonkatsu meals.  Tonkatsu restaurants are ubiquitous there, not quite as many as Ramen ya's or 7 11's, but you won't have any difficulty finding one when you are in the mood for it. Tonkatsu is a very narrow niche, they only serve fried pork loin (rosu katsu), pork filet (hile katsu), and some places may serve fried prawns and such, but that's usually about it.  Most places do fried oysters from Fall to spring.  Tonkatsu restaurants are somewhat different from other genres like sushi or ramen because people don't/can't make nigiri sushi or ramen from scratch at home, but tokatsu is not very difficult to cook at home.  Then how come tonkatsu restaurants are so popular?  Well...it's because they tend to be cheap, and it's a mess to make at home with deep frying and all, but the most important factor is that SOMEHOW....it tastes so much better when the pros do it.  It's just pork, salt/pepper, egg, flour, and panko deep fried, but I just can't make them like they do in Tokatsu restaurants, that's why I go out to Wako, Saboten, Maisen, etc, with their soft/crispy fried panko layer, but when you sink your teeth into it it oozes with all that nice pork fat juice, that's why!  Somehow it doesn't turn out like that at home.\n\nAs I have been saying for years that Vegas needs a tonkatsu place, I was ecstatic to hear that Kiyoshi opened.  it's in the SE corner of Jones and Robindale and it is a cozy clean place with great friendly service.  \n\nThe menu was a bit busier than I liked but seemed legit and there was rosu katsu as I wanted.  You go to Tonkatsu place, you get rosu katsu.  Tonkatsu restaurants live or die with rosu katsu.  \n\nEach table has a sesame grinder and a pot of tonkatsu sauce.  You grind as much sesame you want and add a tonkatsu sauce to make your sesame flavored sauce.  \n\nRosu katsu set looked authentic and promising.  What didn't...was the katsu itself.  It looked a little too brown, dry, and the outer panko layer has separated from the meat and fell apart as it was picked up.  It tasted dry and I could not enjoy any of the juicy pork fat as I bit into it.  It's like going to a Ramen place and having a broth that was tasteless with floppy overcooked noodle.  \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, it's not hard to cook your own tonkatsu.  In order for me to go and pay money for it, it has to be better, MUCH better than what I can make at home and this wasn't the case.  I'm hoping that perhaps mine was a flop.  But the appeal of eating pork/tonkatsu is in the fat and this particular rosu katsu was not fatty/juicy enough, partially due to overcooking.  I would highly recommend them to keep on working at it until when cut into katsu, a nice juicy pork fat flows out and that meat is ever so slighlty pink.  In japan they use \"mukin\" pork where there is no concern for parasites so some tonkatsu places serve their katsu pretty pinkish.  Doing so in the U.S. probably won't fly, but it certainly does NOT need to be overcooked as they did.\n\nThis place has potential, but they need some work on their katsu, perhaps a lot more than \"some\".   I will visit again and hope to see something that doesn't shame their existence as a tonkatsu-ya.  Until then....I'll keep cooking tonkatsu at home."

It is in our neighborhood, and after hearing good things, my husband I decided to go check it out on a date night. \n\nBe forewarned, this is a SMALL restaurant... I'm talking about six tables.  Usually this would deter me a bit, but somehow, it worked toward the charm of this place.  It is comfy and cozy, and the Hawaiian music playing in the background made me very nostalgic as I longed for another trip back.\n\nNow onto the food.  I ordered the salmon and shrimp.  It was amazing!!!  Everything was super fresh, the miso soup was perfect, and it's so fun to get to make your own sauce!  The breading on the salmon and pork is seriously outstanding.  Not greasy at all... Nice and light, and crisp.  I later found out that this is due in part to the owner's sourcing of fresh panko... Not the hard, dry kind we buy at the grocery store.\n\nAnd please, if you like potato salad even a bit, order it here!!!  It's the owner's grandmother's recipe, and it's so unique and delicious.  Potato salad with chunks of apples and slices of cucumber?  Somehow, it totally works!\n\nThe service was just as awesome as the food.  Being newbies, our waitress was super helpful, and the owner went around to every table, including ours.  He is so kind and personable!  We will be back many times in the future!"

            "review": "This place reminds me of curry house coco ichibanya in hawaii! The tonkatsu breading is nice and crispy and fried to a golden perfection.  The curry has a touch of sweetness that I like over Curry Zen.  I feel like Curry Zen is more of a traditional Japanese curry versus this curry has some veggies (carrots and potatoes).  I also like that they have the sesame that you can grind for the tonkatsu sauce; I love the smell of fresh ground sesame and the nutty taste it adds to the tangy tonkatsu sauce.  The only thing that I think was missing was some pickled plum to go with the curry.  The location is the old Rice Trax, but they have done a great job of sprucing the place up and I love the little piggy silhouettes they have on the wall.  If you are a curry aficionado....you have to give this place a try!"

            "review": "My first experience here was a pick up order. My husband wanted pork katsu. After a few hours at the mall, I was too exhausted to cook. I ordered the pork katsu for him and chicken katsu for myself. The pork and chicken cutlets were perfectly cooked. Just the right amount of crispiness with moist and tender meat. It was a generous portion of meat with rice, salad, and miso soup. \n\nMy second time, we decided to dine in with our friends. It was neat to \"make\" your tonkatsu sauce. I'm not sure if I did it right as I never grinded sesame seeds to make tonkatsu sauce before. It turned out good so that's all that mattered to me at that point.\n\nMy husband ordered the same dish and I opted for the katsu donburi this time. We ordered the chicken karaage and the panko crusted soft shell crab for appetizers and sampled my friend's beef tataki. Small, tasty portions but sufficient to whet our appetite for our main meal. \n\nI was pretty much satisfied with my donburi. One minor complaint. I noticed I got half the amount of meat as the pork katsu dinner which was the same price. So I thought it was a bit overpriced. It was still good though. I will have to try the curry katsu next time.\n\nThe service was just OK both times. Another minor complaint that I like to mention-Our friends had ordered chicken karaage too. I'm not sure why mine came out first when they should come out at the same time. I don't like eating by myself and having hungry people staring at my app where I feel obligated to share.\n\nLastly, the restaurant is cute, quaint, and small. I wouldn't come here with a large group. Maybe four people max."

When you walk in to the restaurant you are greeted enthusiastically.\n\nYou can see the chefs and cooks preparing your food through a large, open window. I discovered three people that work there (one is a co-owner) are Hawai'i transplants. \n\nMy son ate the pork tonkatsu and shrimp katsu combo and I ate the pork tonkatsu curry and rice. Delicious. You grind sesame seeds and mix it with the slightly spicy tonkatsu sauce. This sauce mix sets this restaurant apart from the rest. My son tried the melon float which was very yummy.\n\nPrice is a little more than the average \"plate lunch\". My dish was $13 and I believe my son's was $16-$17. Spend a few more dollars eating there instead of in the slot machine!\n\nI am definitely a fan and will make many more trips there.

For an appetizer, I ordered, chicken karaage which I think was a 5/5. Really great breading which a soft crunch as every bite. You can also taste the seasoning on the exterior part of the breading which was so good! \n\nI came here knowing exactly what I wanted to get already because a fellow yelper recommended me to try their curry. So I got just that. It was delicious with their beautifully made chicken katsu which was tender and crunchy on the outside. Mixed with the curry and the meal was just amazingly completely. With my curry, I ordered corn, mushroom and cheese to be mixed along with them and I couldn't be happier. The base was balanced with a hint of a modern take of curry mixed with tradtion. Sounds weird, just try them out and you'll see what I mean. I also loved the consistency of their curry which was thick. It goes very well with the rice. \n\nThe service was a bit slow when we needed it, but when the server passes by, she was always so inviting. She always had a smile on her face whcih was very welcoming considering that it was our first time, and we wanted some kind of recommendations. \n\nWhen I came here, there was only one couple that were seated and they were about to finish their meal. So when they were done, we were the only ones in there for a few minutes until another bigger party came along. That being said, the delivery of the food was a bit slow. I can't imagine how much slower it would be if it was busy. \n\nThey have regulars here and you can tell because you'll always see people come in and out for pick up. Hmm.... Maybe that is why my food was slow to come out. Nevertheless, still a solid restraurant to visit! It's friendly, clean and most importantly, good food!."

I honestly love everything about this place, from the presentation of their dishes, to the little touches they add to make your visit comfortable and welcoming. Their menu isn't extensive, but what they do have, they do it well and with love. I prefer the chicken katsu, but I was eyeing the shrimp on my last visit, so I'll have to do their combo chicken/shrimp next. My fiance prefers the pork katsu and also raved about the quality of their curry. The couple next to us was talking about how the water here is really good.. and I actually have to agree!

Seared beef and ponzu sauce are always a win.\n- Chicken karaage had a nice breading on it, which also made for crispy \"fried chicken.\" But, the chicken wasn't burnt. Thin pieces of chicken which made for fairly juicy chicken.\n- Katsu curry was nice. Wish the curry was a little more spicy but nothing a few chili peppers (on the side) can't solve.\n- Salmon curry was breaded as nicely as the chicken karaage and katsu. Salmon was pretty thick and didn't fall apart when bitten. The best part of that salmon katsu was the salad that came with it. Standard Asian cabbage/slaw but, the yuzo/ponzu dressing was amazing! The owners came by to give us more dressing =)\n- Pickled onions, cucumbers on the side were delish. You can tell the freshness and that it was homemade. The owners were telling us that they get many requests for kim chee so, that may be a possibility.\n\nOverall great experience an the food was very good.

Thoughtfully garnished with tender roasted sushito peppers, the savory bowl is layered with thick, JUICY cuts of lean pork covered with perfectly golden and crisp panko breadding.  To finish it off comes a smothering of a flavorful collaboration of  delicious egg, onion, dashi soy sauce and other seasonings.  This simmer of flavors was poured on top of the rice and settled to the bottom of the bowl making the rice SO DAMN TASTY!  \n\nCurry Katsu and chicken Katsu were delicious too.

I was excited when I first noticed that Tonkatsu Kiyoshi was opening up. I wasn't so excited when I saw their menu and prices online and had no desire to go. One day I was driving around and craved something katsu, with so many options for katsu I decided to finally give these guys a shot since most reviews sounded like I was losing out on something good. \n\nAfter entering I squinted my eyes and saw a nicer looking Rice Trax, the business this location was previously known for. And took a seat at the counter and started to really look at the menu, still very pricey for katsu. I dunno I had the pork katsu with eggs and rice. It was by far the worst things I've ever eaten. I couldn't finish half the little bowl and actually vomited it out when I went back to work. It tasted spoiled or just had a very different taste than what I'd expected, it was funny tasting. \n\nProbably the only positive things I liked about the place nicely presented decorations on the table. You're suppose to grind up sesame seeds and add sauce to make your own katsu sauce which was interesting. I had to ask what's that cause I dont eat at katsu houses, I'm sure I wasn't the only one. A little more customer service would be nice, I really felt like they just wanted my money. Surprisingly they're from Hawaii. When I was done I walked to the door, paused, waited a second for a thank you that didn't come, and left, removing another bookmark for a business I'd never be back to anytime soon.\n\nMaybe it was a bad day!?"

The service is great and the servings are quite huge but will definitely get you your money's worth! I also recommend getting the Arabiki Sausage!"

Try not to sit here.....\n\n The food is not oily and greasy, the Hire katsu is perfect and comes with rice, miso soup and shredded cabbage with a dressing on the side. The miso soup is the best tasting that I have ever had! I have been to a lot of Japanese restaurants, fancy ones and simple ayce types!!! None of them compare to this place... As far as the miso soup goes. If you are into Japanese food and love miso soup must try..\n\n\nLet's move on to the Hire katsu.... Perfect portions and juicy! The breading is perfect and so good. This place has it down to a science. The sesame seed katsu sauce is perfect to compliment.. Don't forget to grind the sesame seeds!\n\n\nNow let's move on to service... The girl that was servicing us never came back to check on us? Not once, just dropped off the food and left..... Hmmmm strange considering that the only other table in there was sitting at the bar.... The other couple on the side table was just talking and drinking water, they were done eating ages ago!!!!! Bad move I am a 20%. Tipper, not today.........  This is the reason for the 4 stars not five!\n\n\nWith all that said I will continue to eat here as this is the only place in vegas that has Tonkatsu that is worth driving here for!!!!!"

            "review": "I used to live down the street so I remember waiting for months for this place to open and when I finally did stop by, I was a bit disappointed. I remember being overwhelmed by how expensive this place was for basically a rice bowl. Yeah you get a miso soup and a salad, big woop. \n\nI had ordered the Hire Katsu dinner which was slightly undercooked. My friend ordered the Katsu curry, which is a joke, because they use the same curry base from the box you get for $1.50 at 99 ranch market. So to be charged $11 for something i can make by heating up in the microwave at home bugs me. I also remember wasting a lot of time and effort grinding the sesame seeds to not even use it in the end. \n\nSo I tried to give it another try a couple years later, and am still not impressed. Not sure if the prices have been the same or got even more expensive. My friend and I ordered the chicken and the Katsu donburi. This time a little overcooked but nothing to be upset about. I definitely don't plan on coming back, especially if the prices continue to be that steep."

Being part Japanese and given that I go back to Japan once or twice a year, I'm a snob when it comes to Sushi and Tonkatsu (among other things).\nNow that being out of the way, this place actually does the job for me. Quite good. Food comes out quickly, service is friendly, and I feel my insatiable hunger for Tonkatsu eased after coming here."

            "review": "Drove by this place when going to work and drove by coming home from work. I love anything Katsu. So I finally brought the family to check this new place out. I'm glad I did. The pricing was OK for the dishes. But that's not why I am writing this. Our kids had fun grinding the sesame seeds into a powder before adding the katsu sauce to it. We ordered the shishito pepper appetizer. It was done correctly and thank you for having sichimi pepper on the condiment tray. I love eating the pepper with sichimi. The edamame is edamame. Thank you for seasoning it, my kids loved it. I ordered the salmon and shrimp katsu and my wife the pork curry katsu. The portions were nice. The serving plate that they served our main dishes on just made the portions bigger. I was happy they placed the katsu on this little metal drain rack that prevented the katsu from sitting in it's on fat drippings like most other restaurant do, thank you. The miso soup was good, the little pickled onion was good. The one that shocked me was the yuzu dressing that came with my dish. Yeah, I said, yuzu. It is to be tossed with the shredded cabbage. I like this touch because normally you would eat oil soaked cabbage with a shot of lemon juice from a lemon wedge that normally comes with the dish. The curry dish was good too. I would write about it but I was too busy enjoying my plate. And btw.....the server lady that we had today is SUPER NICE. She gave off this COMFORTING FEEL that made our night so pleasant. THANK YOU!"

My order was enough for 2! They gave me miso soup, but it was too salty so I didn't finish it.\n\nExcellent customer service. Very friendly, attentive, and courteous!"

However, at Tonkatsu I discovered that the Japanese really know how to cook delicious pork as well. This is a must try boutique restaurant."

They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!"
