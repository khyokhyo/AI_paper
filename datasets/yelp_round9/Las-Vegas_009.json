We ordered the premium beef combo and added a bunch of meat. The kobe style beef was pretty good, and over all marinations in general was decent.  If your in vegas I would go here over the other ones"

Sura is too pricey and I am a little taken back by how they place the raw meat outside.\n\nAnywhoo, Gangnam was a nice alternate to that, since they serve you your food like Tofu Hut. However the quality of the meat is far tastier. Everything that I had was delicious! \n\nWe ordered the beef belly, BACON WRAPPED SCALLOPS, spicy garlic edamame, fried chicken karrage and the banana tempura with ice cream. This is definitely one of the rare occasions where i can honestly say i loved every bite. The service was phenomenal and we came during happy hour. They also have a Robata special after 10pm, must try!\n\nThe proportions were excellent and presentation was beautiful. (Especially the beef belly and banana tempura)\n\nThe exterior of the restaurant does not give it justice to the inside because i was pleasantly surprised by how pretty it was in there, and I did not expect a place like that to be so close to UNLV. \n\nThe ambiance is appropriate for all types of parties from romantic to large parties. (:\n\nI will definitely return & try the whole menu!"

We weren't a large group but still had to wait around 20 minutes for lunch to get seated.\n\nThe food itself is more Korean style - not the most authentic Korean BBQ you're ever going to get, but it's not bad at all. The prices aren't terrible (could be cheaper like in other cities sometimes, but still not bad). Nothing stood out at me, but it was all decently solid food. Our main waitress kind of seemed like she didn't want to be bothered though. It wasn't bad service, but she still kind of gave off that vibe for some reason.\n\nAnyway, if you are in the area and need something like Korean BBQ, this is not a bad option at all."

We ordered beef tongue, skirt steak, bulgogi, and kalbi beef... Plus a salad and a miso soup. They had the traditional sides available. We ended up paying $50 for two of us. I would have rather gone to Hobak or Magal. The happy hour may be something to check out. Other than that, probably won't be making this a go-to spot for KBBQ."

Tender and juicy with flavor!\n\nBeef brisket- it was good, just a Lil fatty here and there. \nBrocoli- bomb.com\n\nK squash- not my favorite thing to grill, came out kinda hard\n\nI will definitely be back.

I probably went wrong in walking in here for the purpose of eating this soup, since it's a meat specialty place. \n\nThe menu, decor, and set-up totally reminded me of GYU-KAKU. Even the little details like the color of the plates and their logo. I got to try some meats off of a set menu, and the meat quality was quite impressive. They have good meats, if you're willing to shell out the price for it. \n\nAs for the yook gae jang and soon tofu, it tasted like salt with no other flavor, and totally was ruined in my opinion. The side dishes however were good. \n\nService was slow, despite the restaurant only being half full. I had to ask for water and certain side dishes multiple times to get it."

Being a LA native, we are constantly being spoiled with $9.99 to $16.99 AYCE KBBQ so it was a change to get out of the cheap AYCE mentality, but this place is definitely worth it! The portions are good, it will definitely fill you up.

I was hesitant for years because it opened shortly after that Gangnam Style song came out, but moved to this side of town and I didn't want to go to Chinatown for Korean BBQ. This isn't all you can eat, but it's actually a lot more fun ordering and you get to be a little more selective. We ordered the spicy karaage, Kabocha squash tempura and the shishito peppers as appetizers. All delicious, especially the squash. We had reservations so all the complimentary side dishes were arranged around the grill upon arrival. For the grill we ordered two orders each of the scallops with bacon, bulgogi, harami miso, and Kalbi, along with an order of corn. We had five people in our party and we didn't finish it all, but got pretty close! It's a really fun experience and it doesn't feel as rushed or impersonal as other places. The decor is also really nice and it doesn't feel like your typical all you can eat/buffet place. Loved it and will definitely be back"

Beware of parking as it always seems jam packed. \n\nThe food was reasonably priced. We got the gangnam special for $65 for two people. Well worth the money if you're going to eat everything. I do mean everything. Otherwise I would have ordered a la carte. All the meat was seasoned and marinated very well that you didn't really need the additional bbq sauce that they offered. We also ordered the steamed chili dumplings..... Don't get those. It's a big dose of spicy sauce with otherwise bland flavors. \n\nWe'd definitely come back only if we felt like splurging.

Had their yakiniku menu & there was so many options to choose from. Appetizers were yummy, we had their calimari, chicken karaage, and cheese wontons. Portion size was decent for the price. For entrees, we had the spicy pork, beef toro, pork belly, & their korean prime kalbi. Those were bomb too. If you're ever in the neighborhood & you're hungry, then check this place out."

After Yelping some nearby options, the 1300 reviews and a 4.5 star rating, drew us in. \n\nAt 7pm on a Saturday, we just weren't sure we could get in so we called ahead and a friendly young man answered. While they don't have a call ahead or reservation list we were able to walk right in.. Though apparently it's not uncommon to have a wait. \n\nAfter being immediately seated, we were promptly asked for our drink order. And moments after asked if we were ready to order -- through out our meal the service has been efficient,  immediate, and impeccable! \n\nLet's talk about the meal! \nWe selected the meat lovers meal for 2, though you can order piecemeal - this included 6 meats, 7 sides, and 3 appetisers for $60 after tax. So if you aren't familiar with Korean BBQ, the premises is that they provide the food and you cook it at a grill on your table.\n\nBreaking it down: \nAPPETISERS\nMiso Soup\nGreen Salad\nSteamed Chili Dumplings\nSpicy Garlic Edamame \n\nMEAT\nSpicy pork\nBulgogi\nBeef Toro\nFlat Iron Garlic\nPork Belly\nFilet Minion\n\nSIDES - I am guesstimating what each of these items are, we did not get a rundown. \nBean Sprouts - Good, nice crunch to them, and not particularly strong in flavor.\nKimchi - very flavorful without being off putting (assuming you don't dislike kimchi in general)\nFish Cakes\nJalape\u00f1os, Onion, and Ginger - they were in a mild marinade of some sort, really good when we grilled them too!\nMacaroni Salad - noodles were a little soft for my taste and too mayonnaisey but my friend liked it. \nSpicy Squid (I think!) - really delicious (and I don't like seafood, at all), the dressing/marinade was flavorful, almost like the kimchi, and the texture was just right, not too chewy but hardy \nSpicy Baby Cucumbers - may have been pickled, but overall nice crunchy texture with a \nRice - sticky and white.. Just a vehicle for everything else!\n(Forgive me for the constant 'flavorful marinade' comments but I have no idea what it is... Just good! Ha!)\n\nDESSERT\nBanana Tempura\nLava Cake\n\nSAUCES - provided in a little side dish per person! \nSpicy soy sauce\nSweet soy sauce\n? Mild soy sauce-type\n\nNow, you'll notice the extensive reviews for this restaurant... Because they offer a free dessert per Yelp review. They definitely follow through and not based on the score or content! They only check that you post it! \n\nA couple thoughts on improvement -- \nProvide some direction for cooking each item (meat and sides). While I was familiar with the process, its always nice to hear tips and tricks to making this a  delicious and easy meal."

We ordered 6 different cuts of meat (spicy chicken, spicy pork, harami miso, kalbi, bulgogi, and regular pork). It was deliciously marinated and juicy and easy to cook yourself. I didn't even need the side sauces. The kimchi was perfectly spicy and the cucumber side dish was nicely sweet. The miso soup had the perfect temperature and flavor. Rice was perfectly cooked as well and service was extremely friendly and very attentive. Best part of it was all that came out to a price that was very affordable and reasonable for lunch (because you're off the strip). Highly highly recommend!!"

It was good for us to be here at 10 PM because we caught the place during happy hour. \n\nWe ordered a lot small plates for the four of us. A few stood out so much we reordered or contemplated reordering them. Among those were the calamari, sweet corn, jalape\u00f1o popper, beef toro and pork belly.\n\nIt helps to take the kimchi and put it on the grill and then eat with the pieces of meat. Needless to say this place will be on the vegas rotation for food for me."

The price was exceptional for the quality as well. Can't recommend enough. I just wish I had a location like thos at home."

Come during happy hour (1130am-5pm and then again after 10pm) and it'll be better bang for your buck.\n\nWe didn't eat much and was still really content and full (for me, at least). We only got short ribs, which they do remove the bones for you so it's just all meat. Then, we got beef brisket, which is pretty typical, as well as 2 orders of pork belly. I'm sad no tripe but I'll live. There are a lot of other things on the menu but I'm not a fan of marinated meat at KBBQs.\n\nDuring my second visit, I got pork cheek, which was my first time eating it so I'm not sure how I feel about it yet... I wouldn't say everything is awesome-tasting but it's not too bad.\n\nThey've got a small selection of desserts but we only got ice cream ($1.95). Flavors: vanilla, green tea, and strawberry. It's a good portion size.\n\nI doubt I'll come when it's not happy hour so there you go. But if you're in the area during happy hour, why not?"

We were warmly greeted at the door, and the servers here were very attentive. \n\nTHE FOOD! There wasnt one thing we regreted ordering. If it wasnt for the awesome variety of food to choose from, I wouldve ordered the Harami Miso all night! So tender and tasty.. do yourself a favor and grab 2 (or 3) of these. \n\nAlso, make your taste buds happy and grab the Spicy Tuna Kimbap. If i didnt love my wife, I wouldve hog cheese that thing and ate the whole thing. Im from Hawaii, so spicy tuna over cooked rice isnt uncommon, but there's were definitely the best i've ever had..\n\ndefinitely one of the best cook your own food style of eating ive ever been too. great quality of food and awesome service. you cant go wrong by dining here!"

We ordered the $120 for four deal. \n\nPros and Cons \n\nPROS:\n-The miso soup that came with the deal has been by the most favorable. \n- The wait staff was on it. We didn't have to waive them down at a all. They continously checked up on us, offered refills, and changed our grills.\n- the attitude and the demeanor of the staff was great. \n- the meat that came with the deal were all great tasting. \n\nOverall, the service and the food were both great. \n\nI didn't have a bad time here with my party and we enjoyed the food. Therefore, I give em 5 / 5 \n\nGreat job"

Actually, Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining is Tapa Style and not all you can eat Korean BBQ, (keep in mind, AYCE KBBQ it's not big in Vegas than it is in Cali). \n\nWe happened to come here during their Happy Hour menu offerings. So we paid for some of the meat choices at a really good price. For that we ended up doubling are orders of the: Toro Beef, Basil Chicken, Bulgogi Beef, Spicy Pork and Pork Belly. The portions we got were good for a party of three. \n\n- Toro Beef: Its marbleized beef brisket and very flavorful. Not as fatty as the ones that you\"ll find at cheaper Korean BBQ places. It was my favorite out of our five choices. \n\n- Pork Belly: Standard cut pork. Not bad at all, they were seasoned. The quality of the pork was good, and had tastiness to it. \n\n- Spicy Pork: Tender cut pork. Smothered in spicy sweet marinade sauce makes this super delicious. \n\n- Chicken Tender Basil: Tender white pieces of chicken. With touch of lemon and basil. They were simple but delicious and it accommodated well with my white rice. \n\n- Bulgogi Beef: Beef was really tender and marinaded with a lot of flavor, very good! \nnuff said. \n\nThe sauces that came with these were: Spicy Soy Sauce, Sweet Soy Sauce and Ponzu Sauce. The Spicy and the Sweet Soy were good. I even combined the sauces and it even adds for more taste to the tip of your tongue. The Ponzu, was the one I enjoyed dipping my meats in. It had that vinegar, sweet flavor to it.\n\nOverall meat quality here, Excellent! The five choices we got didn't disappoint. Every meat was tender and easy too eat. Again, they were less fatty. We enjoyed every bite that came out of the mini-grill. \n\nWe got friendly service here. Our server was very personable, and she turned out to be a cool chick. We even got some Kimchi's on the house. Atmosphere here is modern. There is a big screen TV in one side that would play random upbeat music videos. Also there appears to be space to lounge or dance for the late night vibes. \n\nEven though they don't offer all you can eat. They do combinations, but anything extra outside of that, can get pricey. That's why when they offered the Happy Hour menu, we chose meats with deeper discounts and for a party of three the portions were just right, for a tab around $35. \n\nEh, sexy lady...nom,nom,nom,nom...Oppa NomNom Style!"

We ordered way too much meat for just the two of us, but before we could even try to get our fill of the BBQ, we both started to feel nausea and stomach pain. We asked for our food to-go but never got around to eating it back at the hotel. We crawled into our hotel bed and slept away the pain.

The place was already quite busy, but we were seated immediately. Staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was excellent.\n\nOne of the things we appreciated was that we were able to order the dinner for two, despite our larger party.  An AYCE-format restaurant would not have permitted this.  We added on a couple happy hour food items and the food quantity was more than enough.\n\nOne thing I missed from other korean BBQ places was the dipping oils with the salt at the bottom.  They gave each diner a three-sectioned dipping sauce variety bowl and the sauces in them were fine, just not the salted oils I was hoping for.\n\nOur dinner experience here was very positive and we would gladly return."

The chicken is really juicy and tender, but other items are actually too sweet that you hardly taste the meat and get sick of the sweetness really quickly. The soup and hot tea are not hot at all. Portion size is ample and can easily be for double the amount of guests they recomend. Among all the staff, only one of them is attentive and friendly. We ordered the honey toast which we waited for over 15 minutes and thought it would never be served. We also got the free deep fried banana for making this rate. I believe this is how they got all the reviews and good ratings because you have to show them the rate to get the free dessert!\nIn conclusion, Gangnam is an up coming trendy restaurant with modern/urban feeling if that is what you are into, but as far as Korean food, I would rather spend my money at many other great selections around the city."

I'm not too sure on the dynamics of this establishment. We were the ones manning the grill, which I had no problem with. I've had places where an angry looking Korean lady snatches the tongs away and takes over. It wasn't the usual AYCE but I'll still pho'ks with it. \n\nThe dishes we sampled was the carpaccio, pork belly, brisket, filet mignon, and prime kalbi.\n\nI saw on Yelp that this place had beef carpaccio. Ever since Woonam Jung stopped serving carpaccio, I've been looking for another joint to replace that empty spot in my heart. Gangnam's carpaccio wasn't as extravagant as Woonam's, but just as good. Served on an oily sauce and some greens on top. Simple and delicious. This was my favorite during the feeding.\n\nThe pork belly and brisket. What can you say? It's always good. There is nothing special about these other than the pork belly being thick. Dip them things in the sesame -salt & pepper concoction and you got a happy customer. \n\nALRIGHTY THEN!  Now to the beef. The filet mignon was good and tender. We cooked it quickly to a nice medium rare. It was perfect! Again, I'm glad we were manning the grill. These could have easily been over cooked and ruined. We actually got another order of the filet mignon. The server finally brings in the prime kalbi. He says that this is their signature dish. It was very tender and sweet, but it didn't leave an everlasting impression with my palate. Would I still pho'ks with it?  Sure. The first four orders is a definate though. So in the end, the crack that will have me on the come back is the carpaccio and the filet mignon. WINNER!\n\nYay!, I'm a fan!!!"

From the happy hour menu, we also ordered all the veggies (broccoli, corn, mushroom medley were all $2, seaweed salad was $3) in an attempt to be healthy. Off the happy hour menu, we ordered beef tongue, skirt steak and kalbi. We also ordered peppers, ramen and bibim ngan myung. Lots of side dishes, really good bang for your buck!"

Saw a posted sign at the register advertising a three peice tender combo meal for $5 bucks . \nI clearly pointed to the sign and told the cashier I would have the $5 combo special.  She rang up my order and charged me $7.46 . I took the food to my table and looked at the receipt thinking the combo special probably didn't include the soda . But why would soda be an extra $2. 46 ?   \nI told the cashier I thought the combo was $5 dollars ? She said \" oh that special starts at 7 pm . I asked her to tell me the time since I didn't wear a watch . It was 6:48 pm . I asked her if she could reimburse the difference . I had assumed it was already 7 pm (my fault ) . \nShe went to get someone else . The manager ? Shift supervisor ? Obviously someone who was in charge .  I explained that it was my fault for not knowing the proper time . But since I had clearly pointed to the sign when placing the order , I should've been told that it was 12 minutes too early to receive that special .\nIn a not so friendly manner told me he was unable to refund the difference.\nI asked him if I didn't like the taste of the food or if the food was too cold would he refund the entire price ? He said yes . So I then told him the food was cold and he gave me a very slow and drawn out refund for the entire amount . Plus then he took the plate of food which I had already handled and put it neatly back on the kitchen where I'm assuming he planned on re selling it . ( health code violation) .\nSo for the difference of $2 dollars and 12 minutes in time ... He would rather refund the Entire price of the meal , and also lose a customer forever ? No problem . This is Las Vegas and we have many different  choices on each block to choose from.  The reason I give ONE Star and will never come back is the poor customer service combined with him not throwing away the food I had already handled ."

This place is fun and romantic, definitely setting the mood for the amazon night ahead of us. We had the premium combo with Kobe beef, need tongue, shrimp rice bumpy bop or something, among other yummy things. This was my first taste of Kobe beef and I certainly fell in love. The meat is fresh and well as the veggies. I love how you can cook your food perfectly the way you want it.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and not very invasive. Always refilling our drinks and occasionally checking on us, making sure we were enjoying our experience. \n\nThe price is a little steep, but what do you expect when you order Kobe beef. I would have paid more. I'm sure there are less expensive places in china town but this was close to home. \n\nOver all we had a very good experience, the food was delicious and the staff was very nice.

What makes this place good is that the service is attentive and the prices are affordable, especially during their happy hours that run from 3-6pm and 10pm-close. The HH is worth going to if you plan on eating a lot and drink alcohol. I don't drink that much alcohol anymore so when I'm in LV you can catch me here beyond HH.\n\nThe variety of the food items is pretty stellar also. I'll admit the value isn't as great as some AYCE Korean places like Gen but the quality is good and taste better than what I've had in LV before going here. The atmosphere is pretty cozy also. I like the hugeness of the booths and the quality of the grill that cooks my food. I highly recommend this place if you are looking to eat off the strip or away from Chinatown.\n\nPlus, they give you a free dessert if you write a review of the place. No, I'm not being bought off my rating with a dessert it really is what I think of the place.  It doesn't hurt that they offer this for new reviews of the restaurant though...nice!\n\nOh my...I started writing in Yelp again for a dessert."

It was amazing and even the Korean BBQ virgins with us were very happy with their meals.\n\nWe got there right before 6:30pm and were seated fairly quickly. It's inside a shopping center that is a little difficult to see from the road. They had K pop playing on one of the walls from the projector which is always fun to watch. Service was good and very attentive.\n\nThe only thing that sucks is some of the items that usually come as part of the BBQ is charged a la carte here - like the sea salt and sesame oil dip. They charge $1 a pop for it. Not expensive but a little annoying. The drinks here were all really good and SO REFRESHING. I swear, they've made the best lychee martinis I've ever had and I wish I had their recipe. It was that good!\n\nDown to the food - nearly all of it was nothing short of amazing. We ordered the Meat Lover's BBQ for 4 which was $99. Not a bad price for all you get. The meats were all flavorful and marinaded well. The pork belly was the only thing that could have been better - it was not as thick as some of the other places I've been. I also ordered the seafood soft tofu soup which was good but not the greatest. I still enjoyed it. \n\nI'm in Vegas about once a year and when I come back, I'm definitely going back!"

He was very polite and, thank goodness, spoke really good English! \nWe already looked at some of the stuff on their menu before we got there so we had a pretty good idea of what to order. \nWe ordered a few choice of meats: Bulgogi, flat iron garlic, beef toro, Korean prime rib kalbi, and the Harami Miso. The last two I mentioned were definitely a must have and it's also in the top two of their best sellers. The meat was really great quality and flavor was perfect. \nThey also had three different meat sauces that they provide which is perfect for the other meats that may not already be seasoned. \nI love the little booths that they had as well. Only thing I probably would improve from this place is to have refillable hot tea and to have the sesame oil with salt side as something already provided for. I've never been to an Asian BBQ place that doesn't already do that so I guess that's why I mentioned that. \nBut other than the last two things, the entire place was awesome and highly recommended. I would go back there again with friends for sure!"

The tobiko was cooked to the right texture.\nFor our entree, we ordered beef tongue, beef toro, beef Kali, pork belly and mushroom medley.

The side dishes are all tasty. There are korean music videos playing inside, keeping patrons entertained and in the korean mood. The spicy tuna kim bap was the surprise of the meal - very tasty. The Kimbap  was fried with marinated spicy tuna in a bowl. Korean prime kalbi was excellent as well!\n\nThe only caution would be the meat portions are VERY small. For example, the prime galbi only comes out to be like 4 or 5 tiny pieces....bulgogi portion was also very small...I killed it in literally two bites.....if you want to get more meat, stick with samgyupsal because it looked like they give you more portion for pork meats.\n\nAlso, for limited time only, if you write a yelp review and show it to them, they will give you a free dessert! We got the fried banana tampura with green tea ice cream..it was really good!!"

We went for the Premium Cut package (which included the Kobe beef) but we also tagged on another extra order. \n\nThe Premium Cut package features a lot of great dishes such as fresh shucked oysters, beef carpaccio in ponzu sauce, oven baked asparagus, and my personal favorite was the grilled shrimp fried rice in the clay pot (forgot the Korean name). The rice was so good that we ordered another one to share. \n\nThe Kobe beef was pricey but well worth it - it practically melted in your mouth when cooked to a medium rare. \n\nThe three dipping sauces they give you are nice (one was chili based, another had sesame oil and one was ponzu?) and complemented all the beef cuts really well. Overall it was an amazing BBQ from start to finish. Service was friendly and I will come here again when I'm in town.\n\nPS: The reason why they have so many reviews is because you get a free dessert when you show them your Yelp review - however, I found the dessert to be below average (they are ice cream macarons and looked better than they taste) but that doesn't change how I feel about the awesome BBQ. Skip the dessert :)"

What really got my attention was the absence of the billowing smoke wafting around tables when people are grilling - it's something I both fondly and annoyingly associate with most Asian BBQ places.\n\nThe staff was super attentive from the get go and really helpful when it came to best deciphering which combination of set menus and a la cart items would yield the best sampling of what Gangnam had to offer.\n\nAnd I have to tell you the selection, quality, and flavor of the meats we grilled were impressive: tender, well seasoned, and fresh.  The servings aren't necessarily huge, but it needn't be when it's that good and so reasonably priced that ordering extra isn't too exorbitant.\n\nOverall, Gangnam has to be one of the best BBQ experiences I've had in awhile: great food and drink, stylish decor, and somewhere my little one would enjoy going. It's also helps reminds me how nice / necessary it is to take a break from buffets every once in awhile."

Good option for your first visit. Recommend ordering individual dishes and order more if needed. Bulgogi bibimbop rice dish is a MUST! Let it get crispy before digging in. The harami miso is also to die for! It's worth the walk from the strip! Come during off hours for no wait (we came at 4pm)."

Just SHOW it!\n\nLocation (4/5): The restaurant locates in a corner of a big plaza. Watch out for the big Gangnam sign! From the outside, the restaurant looks pretty dark but it becomes divey when you walk inside.\n\nServices (5/5): We came at 7pm in a party of 7 and quickly get situated! Our server was very friendly. She was also quick at prepping for our BBQ and bringing out side dishes! Since we came in a large group, they also helped us to calculate 18% gratitude fee in the bill. \n\nFood (4/5): You have the choices of ordering individual dishes or order a set such as Las Vegas, Meat Lover, Gangnam (#1 bestseller) and Premium (best cuts). All sets come available for 2, 4 or 6 people with different prices. We ordered Meat Lover for 4 people for a party of 6 adults and 1 child. The portions were huge! It also came with complimentary side dishes, miso soups, rice bowls, salads and dumplings. It was more than enough for us! We also ordered the Kobe Beef Carpaccio ($9.95) and Salmon Carpaccio ($7.95). The Kobe beef was literally melting in my mouth! Soooooo sofffttt! The salmon, on the other hand, added a hint of freshness in a jungle of grilled meat! For dessert, we shared a vanilla macaron ice cream from Brick's! They have the macaron ice cream fridge right at the door, so give it a try if you need a togo dessert!  \n\nI will definitely come back for more :)"

I opted for a seat at the bar to skip the wait. The only difference sitting there is the food is cooked for you and bought out to you instead of cooking it at the table. \nThey had some combos for parties of two, four or six. You can also order individual plates. I think you have to order at least two to get the free sides. \nI ended up trying the Bulgolbi, spicy pork and the sweet corn. All three were good. The pork was a little sweet but it was good. \nThe sides were Kim chi, spicy bean sprouts, spicy cucumbers, and three others that I forgot but all were good. A very filling meal. \nService was excellent even though it was busy. I'll definitely be back."

The menu is easy to read and has pitcures for you to see what each item is (good for first timers). The food presentation was very nice and fresh. \n\nThe staff is very welcoming and polite. They were prompt with getting our food out. We loved that they didnt hover over us. They gave us space and let us cook the meat at our own pace (unlike other korean restaurants where they just dump all the meat on the grill and start cooking anything and everything for you whether you're ready for it or not). \n\nThe restaurant also has a nice and clean dining atmosphere. We came here around 2pm on Friday and not many people we eating here. We will probably come here every time we visit Vegas (we are from TX). \n\nWe recommend anyone who loves korean bbq to come out and try this place when you're in Las Vegas! You will not be disappointed :)"

Outstanding value! \n\nAnother update! Here on 3/15 and still love this place! The happy hour is just such an amazing deal with all the beef selections at $4\nStaff is great and attentive! 5 stars!!"

Its like $3 for an order of pork belly or beef toro (brisket). \n\nCame here for \"dinner\" before an event i had to go to, with a friend. She had been here before and was on the way, so had me order (before it hit the end of Happy Hour time). She liked the Pork Belly and Pork Toro. \n\nService by this young korean waitress was superb. Very friendly and funny. \n\nWe had ordered 3 pork belly, 1 pork toro, 2 toro beef, and 1 prime kalbi. \n\nThe pork toro (pork cheek) isn't discounted. - $5.95 - As the \"toro\" name suggests, it is highly marbleized with some thick areas of fat on the edges. This isn't the first time i've had pork cheek (similar to pork neck meat as well). When cooked properly, and a good quality meat, it should have a super tender texture, and \"crispy\". Not like a hard crispy but like crisp to bite through. I cooked it in a way where it seared the fat giving it a nice crisp in the fat. The pork toro is NOT marinated or seasoned in any way. Quality, to me, seems not up to what i had imagined. Overall still not bad, but could be better. But pork cheek/neck meat is quite expensive. somewhere along $10-15/lb, wholesale. X_x \n\nPrime kalbi - $8.45 - quality wise, wasnt that good either. For them to put the \"prime\" name, id expect a high quality cut of meat, flavorful and tender. Not to the point of aged meats, but you know what i mean. The prime kalbi is seasoned with some slight marinade topped with some finely minced garlic? Pieces are a fair thickness. Cooks nicely. Not as tender as i hoped, nor was it as marbleized as i have had this cut in other places. \n\nToro Beef - $3.45 - otherwise quoted as \"Beef Brisket\". By no means it is the Toro i was thinking of. It is straight up brisket, similar to that of what you get any where else. Misleading name, but i guess it was my fault for believing it may be more towards to the Toro name vs the quoted brisket name. Thin slices of meat. Cooks fast. Simple as that. \n\nPork belly - $2.95 - surprisingly, this was probably the best of the 4 items we had ordered. Even compared to the pork toro or prime kalbi. sad but surprising. Lol. Simple pork belly cuts. \n\nOverall, not bad experience. Priced fair during happy hour. Pretty sure i wouldn't be ordering the meats not during happy hour though. Nice place to try if you are in the area. \n\nThey have a lot of appetizers discounted during Happy Hour as well. Didn't try any though."

As the evening wore on I quickly realized Betty N was on point with her review and the rest were skewed and off kilter. We ordered the Las Vegas which is a meal for two, and added the ribs. The ribs were ok but for me this was the most flavorless meal the whole trip. I was sorely disappointed. I have nothing more to say about this.  Oh wait...the drinks were ok."

He was very attentive and helpful even when I started to forget about the food as the wedding got closer. \n\nPatrick and I facebooked and texted as the date came closer. He confirmed with me the day before and the day of. When we walked over, they were ready for us, all set up and immediately began bringing food out. Everything was delicious and we were all very full walking back to the hotel. It was an overall amazing experience."

We ordered the Gangam for two and extra left over.

We came for lunch and weren't given lunch special menus.  When I asked for the menu, the attitude started.  We didn't end up ordering the lunch special, but not one smile or happy service for the entire meal.  Each request was met with a grumpy grunt.  They don't refill side dishes without being asked like good korean restaurant experiences.  They don't see a utensil falling to the ground in front of their face and move to address it.  They don't move out of the way when you are trying to walk down the aisle to the restroom.\n\nTerrible service will ruin decent food everytime."

The reason that I didn't give this place a five star rating is because once the food was on the table no one came by to check on us. We all needed refills on water and my husband needed another beer. Also, the check was brought before asking if we needed anything else which we were interested in dessert. This is a huge pet peeve of mine. We ordered the honey bread and it took 25 minutes to come out. That's way too long for toasted bread and ice cream in my opinion. However, it was delicious."

I typically like to do the AYCE for KBBQ but this place had such high ratings, I felt it was worth my while. The flavor of the meat was great and the side dishes were pretty darn good. We got ribs and pork belly and the usual meats. I have to say that it's a bit costly since each order is kinda small. Would I come back? I think I most certainly would."

The food was 3.5 stars at best.  Throw on atrocious service they deserve one or two.  \n\nThe bbq wasn't horrible but it certainly was no where near 4.5 stars.  It took 30'minutes to settle the check.  The bbq wasn't warm enough, they didn't provide scissors to cut meat, the seasoning was just ok.  They meat was not cut appropriately.  They brought 3 glasses of water to 5 person table. None of the little things went right.  The seasoning was meh as well."

Big red tables for all your many dishes to come, however the grill itself is not the best like gyu-kaku because the meat we were grilling kept sticking on, even if you brushed oil on grill. We had to change grill twice and we didn't even cook a lot of meat. \n\n*SERVICE WAS GREAT, FRIENDLY STAFF \n\nGangnam is Korean with some Japanese flavors. Located next to \"get nailed\" nail salon. Open til 1am! Bring all your friends. Food was average, kind of lacking in flavor. Our bibimbap that comes with the combo took forever to come out, we really wanted to enjoy it with our meats. I wish the beef brisket was sliced thin. We just the \"LAS VEGAS\" combo for 2 people. I love how they give you the korean side dishes (banchan) especially the cuttlefish!  \n\nI couldn't wait to try it, now I did, and now I'll move on. I'll stick to my gyu-kaku and tofu hut. It wasn't bad, it was like I said average. Great to bring out of town guest. \n\nOh btw don't forget to review here so you can get complimentary dessert! That was nice!"

Meat was very good quality! Ordered beef toro, pork toro, pork belly, bulgoggi bibimbap, fried calamari, spicy chicken kaarage, kalbi, bacon enoki.  Place is nice and clean, Service was awesome too! Will definitely come here again next time we're in vegas.

It took them about 5 minutes to take our order since it was a rather busy night.  The server brought us the side dishes right away.  When I asked a passing waitress for water several minutes later, she told me that MY server will bring me water later..........the water came 3 minutes later but with quite a bit of attitude.  Just placed it on the table without saying a word and with a rather annoyed look about her.  My experience with the service so far has been average., although may be typical for a Korean restaurant.  Now on to the wait for the food.........(the longer the dots....the longer the wait)..........is 10 minutes a long wait?........3 of the 6 items ordered came at the 11 minute mark........5 more minutes later 1 more item came.......3 minutes more and my fifth item came......I don't get how long it takes to cook udon for my little daughter.....anyway, 3 more minutes later and my daughter finally has her udon.  The food was actually very tasty and worth the walk from the strip but I am not entirely happy with the service.  Would I come back again ($64K question)...probably as long as I can tolerate the wait and service.  Time to hit the slots and win me back some money."

If you are wondering why this restaurant have so many reviews and high ratings this might answer your question. (See photo) Yes, for every review you write on yelp, you get a free dessert and the server screens your review. \"You must show posted review to your server.\" After seeing the so-called \"Limited Time Offer\" poster (placed on every table) I felt cheated by yelp. I always use yelp for honest reviews, not reviews that have been somehow influenced and manipulated by the restaurant. It's one thing to give people discounts on their bill if they check-in with yelp, but it's another thing to bribe people with dessert and screen their reviews. My utmost disappointment to the unethical promotional strategy this restaurant uses.  Never coming here again."

For $100, it comes with 6 different meats, 3 types of salads, chilli dumplings, miso soup, rice and side dishes. The quality and quantity is superb! We ate to our fill and still had food leftover. \n\nThe service was phenomenal. Very attentive and friendly. The place is packed but they are well staffed; only had to wait 5 minutes to be seated. \n\nSure, there are all you can eat Korean BBQ places, but I'm all about quality and flavor and will be making Gangman a regular stop when in Vegas!!!"

We were in the area and decided to give this spot with over 4,000 reviews a try. We had big expectations! Perhaps this spot is a hit with tourists but we weren't impressed. First of all,  it irritates me as a culinary professional when restaurants use culinary terminology so loosely. I ordered Sukiyaki Noodle with Beef. If you know Japanese cuisine you know Sukiyaki. I was expecting noodles along with something that resembles Sukiyaki. After all that's what it's called, right? What I got was stir fried noodles with chunks of beef and sliced red peppers served in a stone pot. What is so Sukiyaki about this? Nothing in this dish is anything you would find in Sukiyaki. In Sukiyaki, the beef is thinly sliced rib eye and there is no red bell peppers in it but rather, spinach, shiitake mushrooms, onions, green onions, tofu, bamboo and yam noodles. More appropriately this should be called Yaki Noodle with Beef which simply is stir fried noodles. It looked nothing like the photo on the menu and the portion was very small. My mom had the bean paste soup and it was nothing special. The pickles were bland and lacking any flavor. We ate our lunch but knew we would not come back again. The service? My tea cup sat empty without any question if we would like more hot water.  I finally asked for more hot water since I was never offered it. For $2.50 for each hot tea? At other Korean restaurants in town, hot tea is complimentary."

The complimentary sides were good --- macaroni salad was a little odd but still okay, but the kimchi had some nice heat to it. I ordered garlic duck breast and bulgogi along with a bunch of appetizers...tuna poki, salmon jalapeno poppers,spicy tuna bimbap, and seafood pancake. Oddly, when the meat came out, rice didn't accompany it. Is that common to order rice separately? Bulgogi was flavorful and tender, and so was the duck breast. Tuna poki was spicy...not my favorite...spicy tuna bimbap was so yummy! Seafood pancake was a HOT MESS. Not cohesive...fell apart and properly need a few more minutes of cooking and a lot more seasoning. Salmon poppers had too much going on. I personally didn't like most of the appetizers but the main meats were really good.\n\nI wrote this honest review in exchange for a free macaron ice cream."

Food quantity and quality was excellent, our meal came with pot stickers, salad, rice and yummy sides. I recommend the pre-fixe meals if you are new to Korean BBQ or have a big party. Our Meal fed two adults and two small kids, and sent us away full and happy! Clean restaurant, nice staff, excellent location across from the Hard Rock (we stayed at a nearby hotel)."

The servers were friendly, food was delicious. Everything is small plates only, similar to Gyu Kaku.\n\nWe tried pretty much everything from the HH menu, the spicy pork & beef toro & pork belly were our favorites for the meats. Steamed dumplings, seaweed salad were also good too. This place is definitely worth the try if you don't want AYCE bbq. Can't wait to come back again if I'm in the area!"

Each table has a grill to cook your food. My Hawaiian waitress was friendly and sweet but for a Korean joint I was disappointed the only banchan you receive is Kim chi. I ordered shrimp with head on and sliced prime rib beef. My order  didn't include miso soup and steamed rice so there was an up charge. I did enjoy the three dipping sauces for the entrees which were ponzu, sweet and a spicy sauce. The beef was tender but it was a only 4 ounces for $11.95 The shrimp was decent but was priced at $5.95 for 4 pcs and were on the small side and I've had fresher.\n\nOverall I thought the decor and service was solid, but the food fell short on value and quality and don't think I would return."

The place looked clean but I was a bit EH because I looked up & the filtration grills looked absolutely DISGUSTINGLY dusty & oily.  To the point I was scared that the dust might fall into my food....  I used to work at a  ASIAN BBQ joint so it literally looked like they haven't cleaned it for a month.  =[ \n\nThe service was quick & fast but definitely would say they could work on smiling a bit?  Ahahahah our server was AWSOME though cuz we also knew her from the sushi resteraunt that we love so much in north Vegas!  (The second time we went the service was definitely slower even though there was no one in the place...  Like asking for water and side dishes multiple time from different people before receiving.  So maybe need a little work on the employees). \n\nThe quality of the meat was SURPRISINGLY good! They are a Korean joint but they have the concept kind of like Japanese BBQ in style of serving.  You get a whole bunch of side dishes like any Korean resteraunt & the side dishes aren't bad at all.  They were a good amount & good quality for the amount of money you pay I would say.  I can't really say the other dishes were that great as for the NORMAL palate....  I would have to say it is a bit on the SALTIER side...  But I LOVED IT.\n\nPRIME GALBI $8.95 - just straight up melts in your damn mouth! \n\nHARAMI MISO $8.95 - this is out skirt steak & loved the extra miso flavor. \n\nGARLIC SHRIMP W/ HEAD $5.95 - what a steal. On the price I personally think for jumbo shrimp at only $6 bux & it is lightly seasoned w/ garlic. \n\nENOKI W/BACON $4.95 - no difference but you do get a lot of enoki mushrooms which is great & you get 4 pieces. \n\nASPARAGUS W/ BACON $4.95\nKABOCHA SQUASH $2.95 \n\nBROCCOLI $3.95 - this comes inside a foil already steamed for you to finish off on the grill to give a little char. \n\nPORK TORO $5.95 - ummmmm my FAVORITE part of the pork & you get it at pretty much a $1 a slice!  Where as most places I have been to it is $2 a slice \n\nSPICY TUNA KIMBAP $6.95 - this is literally see weed wrapped rice & then tempura battered.  It has the PERFECT chewy texture like mochi & then stopped off w/ spicy Mayo tuna! \n\nCHILI SPICY WINGS $6.95 - this is what typical Korean wings taste like & I love it. \n\nSPICY SOFT TOFU SOUP $9.95 - I absolutely CRAVE this damn soup....  I'm sure there is some crack in it...  & doesn't really taste like your typical Korean spicy soft tofu soup but I loved it!"

We ordered the Chicken Karaage, Steamed Chili Dumplings, and then the Spicy Pork, Beef Toro, Pork Belly and Bulgogi for the BBQ aspect of it. Since it was so cheap, we ended up ordering about 3 or 4 of each of the meat items.\n\nThey also had beers on happy hour too, so we took advantage of those as well.

I'm one of those girls who can't really eat A LOT so this is the place to go. It's pretty cheap for a la carte especially since I don't eat that much. Their meat is really good quality.

I wanted to bring everyone to it and show them how good it is! I feel like it's definitely hidden, but it's right next to UNLV so it's convenient when I don't know what to eat, I usually suggest here for a quick lunch.\n\nMeat I always order: Bulgolgi, Beef toro, Brisket, and Bacon wrapped Salmon.\nI always get their steamed egg too. BEST steamed egg I've ever had in my life!\n\nTheir three different sauces are to die for and they're great! They also give you lemon for your beef tongue! Really tasty!\n\nThe lunch special comes with rice, miso soup, and salad. The salad is huge! And it's reasonably priced at lunch, so do try to come in for lunch!\n\nTheir desserts are SO good too! We've had the green tea and vanilla ice cream. Their sundae's come with little pocky sticks too! MM What a great idea!!!\n\nI definitely recommend this place if you're trying to find some prime meat!\n\nService is AMAZING.

The price for the amount of food you get when you order off of their combos was definitely decently priced, but the service... my visit was at 1:00PM on a Friday and there was 1 table  with guests dining there. We walked in and kind of stood by the door waiting for someone to come greet us. It seems like the entire staff was on their break or something. Perhaps I am not with the Vegas lifestyle, and people don't come in to eat at 1:00 PM? Maybe we missed the lunch rush? Was no one working? It took a bit for someone to seat us. After we sat down, it was like they forgot we were there. We had to get up and find someone to explain the menu, take our order, change our grill, and re-fill our water. This place is definitely delicious, but service at 1:00 PM was not the fast and friendly service I had read in all these reviews."

There are both booths and regular tables that fit up to 6 people. The tables are a little wide for my taste, since it puts a big distance between customers sitting across from each other, but over all, it is a comfortable setting. \n\nMy friend and I came in during happy hour. We ordered $16 worth of food, which was more than enough for us. The meat was top-notch quality, and I actually liked all of the the sauces they have here. The side dishes were plentiful. As always, I loved the fish cake. \n\nThe service was fast, attentive, and efficient. I will definitely be back here for Korean BBQ, even though they are not all-you-can-eat."

The environment was fun, you get to cook your food on a grill at the table. I'd say the amount of food for two would be better for 4!

My absolute favorite was the marbled high end meat, Kobe beef, basically everything was fresh cut and I love how the thin meat got somewhat crispy. I would definitely recommend eating it with rice to anyone who is planning on eating here.  There was great service ( kind waiters who check up on how your meal is every once in a while and are not aggressive ) and they had a huge selection of foods to grill / cook. Compared to other restaurants I've eaten at, this restaurant has very quick service which is very convenient because I tend to get hangry ( angry because I'm hungry ). The restaurant was cleaner than a ton of other Asian restaurants. Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining is an overall 5 star restaurant.  I do not eat much most times BUT at this restaurant I ate more than usual and I'm so full I could konk out and fall asleep right where I am."

But the price is kind of expensive for the amount of meat given. The servers don't really check up on your table so you have to go chasing for the servers to get what you want. Also, when I ordered the fried calamari, you can't really taste or feel the calamari inside. It's more of batter than the squid itself. Lastly, I'm more on the shorter side, so the chairs were kind of too far so I kept having to move forward to reach the table. Since the service we received was not good, we did not leave a tip so while we were waiting for our uber, one of the servers, came outside and asked if service was bad, and we responded by saying \"it was alright\" and he was like \"I was just asking because you guys didn't leave a tip\". How rude of him to chase us for a tip when service was bad. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN."

            "review": "Short version: the best korean BBQ in Las Vegas, though not quite as good as Kang Ho Dong in LA (but then again, what is?).\n\nTook my parents here for their anniversary, and again came back a few days ago with my friend. It is very well situated on Paradise and Harmon, in a plaza with lots of parking and easy access. The establishment is clean and well lit, unlike some of the all-you-can-eat korean BBQ's around here. Staff were kind and helpful, and often go out of their way to help you even when times are busy. The grills are also clean, and appear well maintained. The only thing that I wished they did more was that the staff cooked the meats for you, like Kang Ho Dong, so that the meats are perfectly cooked if you're not very experienced in cooking yourself. That being said, our server was kind enough to go out of his way to cook for us several times.\n\nWe ordered the premium prix fixe for 4 ($160), which comes with the following:\n\nStarter\nKobe Beef Carpaccio - was absolutely delicious. I'm not usually a fan of carpaccio, but they marinated the meat very well. It was a bit oily I thought, but the flavor was just right. My parents are not crazy about raw meat, so I pretty much finished all of it by myself.\n\nTuna Poke - standard poke\n\nFresh Oyster - was surprisingly good. Fresh without hints of fishiness. I didn't get any bits of the shell at all, which is nice because a lot of other places have it. They put some tobiko and small amount of what I think is sriracha on it, which I think really enhances the flavor.\n\nGreen Salad - standard salad\n\nShrimp Bibimbap - standard bibimbap\n\nMiso Soup - standard miso soup\n\nBBQ dishes\nKobe Style Beef - was very good, but I personally don't like my meat this fatty.\n\nKorean Prime Kalbi - The second best after the harami miso. It was very well marinated and the meat was just the right amount of chewiness and texture. I heard the regular prime kalbi (non marinated) is even better, and will have to try it next time I come.\n\nHarami Miso - absolutely fantastic, the best out of the meats I've had. The marinate was perfect, not too salty. The meat was amazing, a perfect combination of meat and fat. It will just melt in your mouth, then allow you to roll your eyes back and moan.\n\nFilet Mignon - was a good filet, but I thought there were better meats. The cut was kind of large for my liking, which takes awhile to cook. It was very lean but still tender.\n\nScallop - typical scallop\n\nShrimp - typical shrimp. I was kind of surprised that they have shrimp here, but I'm guessing they're trying to do the \"surf and turf\" thing with their meats.\n\nAsparagus/mushrooms - the enoki mushroom was actually very good. They come precooked inside a wrapped foil, but you can heat it up some more on top of the grill. It was a bit too much butter for my own taste.\n\nSince the table is not setup with ssamjang (korean spicey dipping sauce), and gireumjang (sesame and salt dipping sauce) I recommend that you ask for it. The standard 3 flavors they set up for you is good, but I thought the ssamjang and gireumjang brought out the meat's flavor more.\n\nWe also got the macaron ice cream sandwiches at the end, and they were also very good. I liked the vanilla flavor most.\n\nOverall, I was very pleased with my experience. I will never go back to the all-you-can-eat korean BBQ's here in town again after this. It is totally worth the money, and even then it's very fairly priced. Will definitely come back time after time!"

Also, most reviewers haven't mentioned the sodas are bottomless for only $2.75.\n\nYou have the option to grill at your table or in the kitchen, but table side is definitely the way to go to control your level of done-ness (and I hope you are getting at least one beef dish at Korean bbq)."

We had 10-11 people and they gave a huge portion that was able to fill us up with only $20-22? each. THe reason why it's more like a 3.5 is because the quality meat is only okay. It really could be better but of course it's still better than your typical AYCE bbq. I actually think the meal went from great to good. Their appetizers( the little small dishes that korean places serve were great and we got soup, bibimbap(which I thought was really good and flavorful). They also had their happy hour from like 9-close? or something like that but i have to say the meat(pork belly + beef toro) weren't great all even though it was the happy hour price. \n\nRegardless, I think for a bbq place like this, they give you a great portion for a good price is the reason why I gave it a 4. It's not the best non-AYCE place but their set meals are nice and worth it."

The main entree consisted of Kalbi, Bulgogi, Pork belly, Spicy pork, and the only meat i was really craving on the menu, Filet mignon!

Listen to the server if she advises you to order less! Do not make our mistake! We had SO much food we couldn't believe it and it was all delicious! We had a ton of leftovers. The cream cheese wontons were terrific and I also had the ginger Soju; best cocktail ever! Each cut of meat was tasty and you cooked it as you saw fit. The servers were excellent as well. Don't miss out! Please visit this restaurant!"

Got the seat and immediately order the $65 package for 2 person. Banchan were not fresh. Almost all the meat choices were chewy and tough. At least the salad was fresh. In LA Japanese and Korean bbq that has 4.5 - 5 stars they use imported charcoal and really careful with the meat. Overall experience: disappointed. Not worth the money."

On Christmas Eve, they weren't offering their usual (less expensive lunch menu) but hats off to the hardworking crew for working over the holidays. It's a mile or so east of Planet Hollywood so plan to drive or Lyft over unless you need the exercise.\n\nThe restaurant was basically full at 2:30 in the afternoon, which we took as a good omen. The banchan (free appetizers) came out even before we ordered and included a macaroni salad alongside the more typical kim chi, pickled spiced cucumbers, bean sprout salad, pickled radish and fish cake. The bean sprouts could have used a touch more seasoning but were otherwise fine.\n\nThe meats were well seasoned, so much so that we didn't much miss the traditional dipping sauces. We ordered a bibimbop that came in the traditional stone bowl but was not hot enough rice to crisp the rice. The bulgogi that came with the bibimbop was excellent but the only other sides were hints of red peppers and onions: order only as a side to accompany your BBQ and not as a meal.\n\nThe grill and exhaust hood were carefully maintained: gleaming metal shiny clean. Bathrooms were clean as well.\n\nService is typical for Asian restaurants: workmanlike but not particularly friendly. A bit slow but chalk that up to the steady stream of diners.\n\nThe kids gave it a 4 so we will round up from 3 or 3.5.\n\n\n\nDisclosure: we were offered a free dessert for this review. Ice cream macaroons were delicious!"

The cool thing is you get to cook the food on the grill located in the center of the table, which allows different people to cook their meat to their own liking. I recommend the Korean Prime Kalbi as the taste is superb to others I've had. A great addition to the meats and amazing appetizers they offer, you'll receive around 6 side dishes to accompany your meal. The pickled ones are not my favorite but I'm not particularly a big fan of that in the first place. The staff is very pleasant and is quick to help. I like the style of the atmosphere, low lighting with huge tables and they play a wide variety of music and play the actual music video. They also have a TV playing sports just in case you are into that. Overall I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Asian BBQ."

The seafood was decent, then again I didn't go there for the seafood.  You order ala carte, but the price is still very reasonable. The staff was friendly and attentive -- perhaps too friendly.  We had the back-room booked for a party of 10, but the previous party was taking way longer than expected.  The staff would not hurry them up so they had to sit us elsewhere.  Still, if you are looking to gorge yourself in some quality meat, you will not be disappointed in this place."

I had to delete it because it was so untrue about this place.\n\nThis place sucks balls. I'm not comparing it to LA at all. They charge for sesame oil and salt and salad? $4.75 for a steamed egg? You got to be kidding me. Plus they're portions are so small and expensive, I couldn't even get full! Oh and rice was $2 for a small bowl...\n\nSo literally each place of meat only has 6 small pieces for $9. So we pretty much ordered everything in the meat section and some bacon wrapped scallops snd salmon. Those were honestly okay. \n\nWe decided to try something new by getting cheese fondue with broccoli. BIG MISTAKE. It was literally Kraft single cheese with oil? It didn't even melt right over the fire and wouldn't even stick on the broccoli. \n\nSERVICE? Okay they were attentive when it came to ordering... But when we tried to refill our bachan they never came of course . We tried refilling twice on radish and bean sprouts! They said yes and then never return with it! \n\nPlus when we received our bill they didn't put our drinks on HH and we had to tell them. *eye rolls* \n\nOverall, I regret coming here based off fake reviews. I should of when to Gyu-Kaku.  Don't waste your money here."

The only improvements I can recommend are the seats (really hard and uncomfortable) and the waitlist protocol. They should have a buzzer or take down phone number to send a text. We had to wait even longer because they supposedly called out our name four times and we went for a stroll since there were still 6 parties in ahead of us."

We were supposed to go to a buffet at the strip (Caesar's), but the line was too long. Luckily we found this place! \n\nThis isn't too far from the strip. It's located in a plaza and there's plenty of parking. We came around 10:40 pm and got seated in less than 10 minutes. We also got our food pretty quick after ordering. It took them 5-10 mins to get the main dishes and a total of  less than 30 mins for everything else. My only complaint is that the booth that we got (located on the right side) was very awkward to sit on for me. I'm a short Asian person. Anyone who's probably 6' and muscular/big build would sit comfortably in this booth. The seat is too far from the table. Other than this, everything is perfect. \n\nWe ordered the Gangnam Combo and substituted the Green Salad and Koshitsu Pepper Yuzu for the Broccoli Cheese Fondue and Squash Tempura. The Broccoli is okay, not really mouthwatering. My favorites are the beef toro, Korean prime kalbi, 4 out of 8 of the banchans, Mushroom Medley, and the Oysters!!! The Oysters are definitely one of the best ones I've had. \n\nFor dessert, we got the Mango Macaron Ice Cream and Tempura with Green Tea Ice Cream. Both free woot!\n\nOverall, this competes with the Korean BBQ places in LA, but cheaper. Awesome!"

My first child hood best friend was the son of a Korean diplomat and I discovered teok galbi and mandu guk by the time I was 6. Discovered Korean club rats a decade and a half later.... And then one day, Gangnam opened up in Vegas. \n\nI like Gangnam for several reasons... I love Korean food but am not a KBBQ fan. I just don't like the idea of paying to cook my own food....which brings me to the point that already prepared dishes are generally overpriced in Korean restaurants, and service can be such that unless you're getting KBBQ, the staff will try to lead you into ordering the most expensive prepared dishes, claiming they're all that's available, etc as you're taking up expensive BBQ realty... \n\nGangnam is different... they'll cook your KBBQ for you in the kitchen without a problem if you ask them to, and the prepared dishes are affordably priced. Plus, the service is the best I've yet to experience at a Korean restaurant. The K Pop star looking staff is extremely professional, courteous and offer service that's on par with that in much pricier restaurants. \n\nAs far as the food goes, I really like the spicy pork bento box... yeah, they use jalapenos instead of Korean chilies but... it still tastes good and has just the right kick without being too spicy. The bul gogi jap chae is really good...as are the seafood pancakes. But my favorite dish is the steamed short rib with rice. Pair that with an ice cold Hite and you have a perfect meal. \n\nI know some people complain about the lack of ban chan, but you can get kimchi if you ask for it, and other accompaniments are around one or two dollars. While it may not be an authentic aspect of Korean dining, I think it minimizes food waste."

The prices are pretty reasonable, although I know most of you will whine that they aren't AYCE. They have slightly lower prices on certain meats during lunch and happy hour. I started off with the typical pork belly, beef brisket and seaweed salad. I must say the quality of meats is a step above the other AYCE places on Spring Mtn. hence you get what you pay for. Both meats were very delicious and I was still a tad bit hungry so my server recommended to me pork toro. The meat was just okay and I actually prefer the pork belly instead of this, plus it's cheaper too. The service was good for the most part, but since the place was empty, at one point the server and host both disappeared on me, which delayed me from ordering my second round of meat. It wasn't too big a deal because someone eventually appeared again in the dinning room. I live really close to this place and I will probably be coming more often. This is a perfect option if you want Korean BBQ, but your waistline can't afford to do AYCE. Also a nice place for lunch, because if I would of stuck to the beef brisket, pork belly and rice my bill would of been around $10. Can't wait to come back especially since eating here won't break my budget."

Food was really good here and if you order right, Happy Hour can save you money! Not for us bc we ordered too much. Haha...and catered for non-Koreans a bit more. Everything is a la carte or you can get combo deals for 2. \nBeef Toro- slightly thicker than I am used to compared to L.A. places. Wasnt that great in tenderness or flavor so not sure what the good reviews are for.  Gave us more than expected and couldnt finish all 3 HH orders. \nPork belly- was decent and only finished 2 HH orders of it. \nDwenjang jigae (bean paste soup)- a bit sweet and less salty than Im used to but was good. Not a huge bowl but enough to share as a side to meats. Know that this takes longer to make so it doesnt come out right away!\nRice - only 1 comes with soup order but they give a decent amount. Also got a bowl of brown rice.  Should've just shared the one bowl.\nUdon- good variety and amount of tempura. Would get tempura on the side if u like it crispy and not all soggy. \n-Spicy tuna kimbap- was yummy! Started with this (not on HH menu). 4 little deep fried rolls of plain rice in toasted seaweed but yummy cubes of tuna in spicy mayo sauce all over. Yummy!!\nEverything is a la carte...side of green onions in sweet  vinegar  (pretty good), lettuce and bean paste sauce, rice...just ask bc it probably is extra, unless u ger a combo. \n-side dishes were decent and refillable if i get ar leadt 2 orders of bbq meat per person? \n-If we ordered less at first and waited to see how much came out, we wouldve saved a good amount during Happy Hour. Would have stuck with 2 HH orders of meat for each person and share one bowl of rice. GOOD SERVICE TOO!\n-Can also get free macarons for yelping but didnt do that.  :)"

The food comes real fast and before you know it, you're done. But with plenty of leftovers. Wagyu was nicely fresh and marbled, but tough.  The salad was awesome and fresh.  Shrimp was so so, kimchis were also so so.  Very Americanized meal.\n\nSeating in the booths was very uncomfortable. So if there is an other option, I suggest you choose a table. Booths have very hard wooden seats with semi soft backing that was also WAY too far away from the table. Awkward seating situation that made us squirm through the meal.\n\nThey promote that you get a free dessert if you rate them on Yelp, which I think, contributes to the ratings here. They don't require a high rating, but would you eat a dessert after you show them that you just gave them a bad review? Nope."

The waitress didn't seem to know what she was talking about when she told us that we needed 3-4 BBQ tapas per person. We took that advice and ordered a lot of meat (more on that later). \n\nFood: Salty! Everything is made with extra sodium... the meat, soondubu, jap chae etc. the pork belly is full of fat. I get it's pork belly, but the cut was really cheap. We got the toro, marinated kalbi, and bulgogi and none were impressive. In fact, my party was going to ask if we can sell some meat back! The \"compliment\" dishes were all salty and doesn't seem fresh. It was kimchi, kimchi cucumber, mac, fish cake.\n\nDisappointed and will not recommend."

It's probably the cheapest BBQ I've had that does not sacrifice on quality. There were many different options, a la carte or combos for 2 or more people- we decided a la carte was better since we could order exactly what we wanted. Pork belly is my favorite, so we had several portions of it in addition to the spicy pork. Also ordered kimchi jjigae on the side. The taste of the kimchi was a little off that day, so naturally, the jjigae had the same flavor, but it wasn't too bad. There was plenty of panchan, and all of the dipping sauces were complimentary, including the sesame oil and salt (they no longer charge additional for it).\n\nService was excellent. The servers were very friendly and attentive, refilling our drinks and panchan as needed. So glad I tried them out and would definitely consider them again next time I'm in Vegas."

The spicy tuna kimbap was okay...there was too much rice for me. I didn't realize it's just spicy tuna over deep fried rice. We also ordered the yuzu soju, but it tasted watered down. I was kind of skeptical because the menu shows that its yellow...but the one we got was clear (like the lemon soju)\n\nI would definitely come again if I was in Vegas.

It wasn't too busy and we were given a huge table for only the 2 of use pretty soon, the entire table was covered with the complimentary dishes and the rest of our order of:\n\nx SUN DU BU ($9.95 with rice) The best I've ever had and I've had a lot. The calamari was so soft too although there ended up being too much calamari to soup ratio.\nx STEAMED EGG ($4.95) this was not very good as it was over-steamed and not silky as it usually is at other restaurants. \nx HARAMI MISO ($8.95) This was really succulent and tasty. Must order!\nx KOREAN PRIME KALBI ($8.95) This was tasty although a bit too fatty for my liking. \n\nThe lettuce is $2 but it is so fresh and crispy, it is a must for complimenting the bbq meat.\n\nRate them on Yelp and you get a free dessert. We got the Mocchi which was OMG.\n\nWe were so full at the end but the prices were so reasonable. I would definitely be here more often if I wasn't a tourist."

That explained the rating well for me.\n\nI would have given it a 2 star if it was located in LA. But I believe different city should have different standards especially with Asian food. \n\nThe food itself wasn't that bad , it was random. The brisket definitely was the worst I ever had in any k bbq place. It was thick and watery.  Steam egg = 1/10.  Fried yakisoba = 2/10 - the noodle was edible , but the beef was not.  However to be fair, the other meat plates were good, especially the prime rib - one of the best I ever had in kbbq. \n\nNow the service. There was no service. Never refilled our soda, never attempted to change our grill plate despite it being totally unusable, and I saw they saw how dirty it was, but they just passed by! If it was back in LA, the plate would have at least been changed 3-4 times. \n \nSo all in all, will never go back , and won't recommend to anyone who truly enjoys kbbq."

The meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful. They even had brown rice for our little one. But I would say the kimchi was the best part. It's sooooo hard to find authentic fermented kimchi that pairs well with meat.

The place is located in a mall looking area next to a 24 hr nail salon.  I remember this because I was amazed that they had such thing as a 24 hr nail salon.\n\nWe came around 11 at night, a pretty late dinner for us.  But we're in Vegas so thankfully there are lots of late night places to eat.  The good thing about arriving here late is that we made it to the late night happy hour.  I definitely recommend ordering from the happy hour menu!  We literally almost ordered everything from it plus a tofu soup that wasn't on their happy hour menu.  I thought it wasn't going to be enough food but boy was I wrong.  It was too much food! Although my bf can eat a lot, we still had leftovers.  All the meats were good!  Also recommend the cheese wontons. We got 2 orders of those cause my bf liked it so much.  The tofu soup had big chunks of tofu sticking out from the soup and was filled with lots of kimchee and meat inside.  They also give a variety of ban chan.  All so yummy!  I was pleasantly surprised by this place and was even happier with the price.  I would compare this place to being like Gyu-kaku but better!  Service was good, fast and food was great.  No complaints here!"

Both times we came for the late night happy hour. The meat and veggies are really good, the staff are friendly and the prices are right. The combos are a good value, we opted to add to it with a couple dishes from the happy hour menu. The side dishes are good and have a good variety. I haven't been to any other KKBQ's in town, but I don't think we need to. They have everything we want and more. Some day we will hopefully be able to bring a few more people with us and really get more meat and veggies so the two of us can try more items. Definitely a must try and fun for the entire family, away from the craziness of the strip if you need that. (Yelp LA Challenge #44 of 100)"

Both were absolutely fantastic paired with their house soju. The banchan, unlike other Korean restaurants, is plentiful and the server explains what each one is. \n\nI'd recommend the dumplings in chili oil, the Japanese peppers and the mushrooms (dip them in the ponzu sauce).\n\nThe servers here all appear to be Korean-American which helps with communication. Don't get me wrong, I love an authentic kbbq but ahjummahs are not always known for their friendly customer service.\n\nEven the rice is on point! They offer brown rice for the health conscious but order white rice because it's exceptional.\n\nThey have Brick macaron ice cream sandwiches at the front as well as if you needed any more reasons to come here."

We wanted the check and our desserts but they did not bring that out right away. We finally got up and told a waitress but she was slow too. The place was not even packed to have this kind of service at this kind of speed...."

The bf was hungry so we tried nearly half the menu and all the meat and veggies were fresh (be sure to get the Korean Prime Kalbi & the Japanese Peppers), the sides were flavorful and our waitress was super fast & friendly.

A good way to keeps hands busy as well throughout the meal (not a chance of awkward hand holding) but dimly lit enough to make it feel intimate. \n\nBeing overly prepared we called in advance and made a reservation for two along with a toddler requiring a booster seat. Upon arrival right before the dinner rush around 2:45 pm Saturday we were promptly seated and greeted and drinks came out immediately afterwards. Seemed to be the best time to come because it was empty when we first got in and filled right up starting at 3:15. The ice tea was delicious, we had refills. I noticed that the booths basically were benches and were kind of uncomfortable, with a very utilitarian feel that assured me that men probably love flocking here for happy hour with their buddies. I was not wrong once I saw the happy hour menu as it was mostly geared towards beers. We dove right into the menu and ordered pork belly and marinated Kalbi strips to bbq with rice on the side ($1.95) and I ordered the Korean soft tofu soup with seafood. \n\nOur server was attentive, not overtly friendly but helpful. Since it was just us two girls and we don't eat much we didn't get any appetizers or dessert. The first thing to come out first were the sides, which you get complimentary if you order at least two bbq dishes. There was a variety of them, what I noticed was the pickled vegetables were good, the kimchi was great and the bean sprouts were bland, but that was fine with me. Throwing them in the marinade they provide for dipping might help. Then our meats and my soup arrived. Oh my, delicious. We threw the meats on and I dug into my stew and it was instant love. Although the stone pot it comes in may seem small, the portion was perfect for me. The chef made it perfectly spicy, with a kick of kimchi taste and an egg cracked right in. There was a respectable amount of seafood in there which I appreciated, and the meats, once seared with a nice crust, were super yummy. I only needed half of the large helping of rice that came with my soup before I was full. \n\nI then turned to the sangria which I order partway through my meal just to try. It was delicious, but made with a dry red wine I didn't love, with blueberries and raspberries floating within. Perfect sweetness though so no complaints, I'm just more of a non-dry white wine person. If you enjoy red, get the sangria. If not, the plum wine might be a better choice as I love Asian plum wines, plus it's cheaper. As a side note, the women's restrooms are well-kept and clean but no place to change your baby so not too friendly for families with babies. \n\nOverall, thoroughly satisfied with the experience we had there is go back again. The only reason for the one star deduction was that it was a great experience but didn't knock my socks off with value for the price. I would go back though. A definite must for Asian cuisine foodies visiting Vegas!"

The meat is very high quality compared to some of the all you can eat kbbq  places.\nThere's also a drink and spirits menu.\n\nI recommend the marinated kalbi  steak, it's very tender and juicy. Also, try the bacon  wrapped sparagus, it's crunchy and crispy at the same time.\n\nVery appropriate place for a date or a group gathering. Not recommended if you're single haha\n\nThe service was great, atleast 5 people came by multiple times to make sure that we were properly serviced. The staff was also friendly and easy to talk to and they explain the menu."

And you got so much food for your money, especially with the COMPLIMENTARY sides!! And the food and meat is just bursting with flavor. My favorite things to get are the bulgogi bimbimbap, salmon carpaccio, hirami miso steak, and the bacon asparagus. But honestly EVERYTHING is good down to the water. It's not your typical tap water. And let's not forget the dipping sauce, it just takes the meat over the top. If this place was closer to me I would spend all my money eating here. Also the service was above and beyond.

The meal included salad, raw oysters, shishito peppers, corn, mushrooms, miso soup, several kinds of meat, and bulgogi bibimbop. There was also the standard kimchi and other appetizers you get at almost every Korean restaurant. We were there for Happy Hour so we also got a pitcher of beer for half-off.\n\nOverall, everything tasted fairly standard to me. Nothing really stood out as amazing. I felt the salad lacked much flavor at all and the miso was just standard miso. The bibimbap had no chili paste or veggies and was pre-made when it arrived. It was more like just straight Korea style fried rice with some bulgogi inside.\n\nI guess having been to Korea, nothing ever is quite the same; however, I have had other places that are much better than Gangnam. \n\nMy biggest issue with the place was the speed in which they serve you. It was way too fast! Within minutes of ordering you have everything you ordered on the table. We didn't have time to finish a single appetizer before the next thing came out. At one point our table was so full there was literally zero room for anything else. I really felt like they were just trying to rush us out. \n\nI have to say that I don't think I will return here next time I am in Vegas."

Each table has a sign that says you will get a free desert if you show your Yelp review to a server.  No, I did not get a free desert for writing this.

We decided to order individual items since I didn't like everything I saw in the combos. It was a great choice because we got to try everything we wanted. Nothing went to waste. \nOur favorites: beef bulgogi, spicy pork, enoki bacon.\nThe flat iron garlic was good, meat was very tender but lack in flavor. They do give you 3 dipping sauces for your meats. \nWe also got the Korean marinated short rib. Flavor is similar to the beef bulgogi, meat was tender. \nFor the price difference I would just stick with beef bulgogi at $3.95 instead of the other two mentioned above that cost $8.95. \nSides included: cucumber, Kim chi, sweet onion/daikon, weird spicy noodle dish (not our fave), Mac and cheese salad.\nHusband ordered the steamed egg, it looks really big but not as fluffy and airy like the one from Tofu Hut. \nI ordered the house salad. I liked the variety of mixed greens and cherry tomatoes, Lao came with an egg cut in half. The dressing sauce had a hint of orange citrus flavor, yummy. \nService was decent. They switched the grill out as soon as it was black. \n\nStick with the marinated items if you like flavor in your meats. \n\nOur total came out to be $58. \n\nWill definitely return."

All with good quality and very enough for two people. The sauce that comes with the meat was really great too, and they also offer complimentary side dishes. The side dishes were all delicious. Among all side dishes, I like the fish cake the most:) such a pity that's not on the menu though. Overall, me and my friend are definitely coming back again!"

I went with two of my buddies and it was our first time there. We were greeted and seated promptly. Little did we know but we arrived during happy hour. 50% off pitchers and some of the dishes were priced at or around $4.00.\n\nWe advised the waitress that this was our first time and she recommended that we do the special for two people(+15% off for happy hour) and if we wanted to order some additional sides. I believe we ended up ordering the #1 with all the different beef options and also two sides of toro. The amount of food that came out was really overwhelming. As with any KBBQ spot the side dishes arrived (kimchi, Mac salad, salad, and some other items) along with the sides came 4 oysters, bibimap(fried rice), mushrooms and I believe that was all. If you have a chance definitely stop in because the food was great. With the three of us the bill came out to around $34/ea."

One other couple at a table.  The cheerful staff seated us promptly, and equipped us with menus.  \n\nThe usual suspects on the beer list, plus a few oddballs which made for nice variety, and also a choice of sakes and other asian alcoholic beverages.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the asian BBQ style of dining (as I was) each table has a small gas grill set in its center (and exhaust hoods with fire extinguisers set above them).  Each place setting comes equipped with a pair of tongs.  You order off the menus small (4 oz) batches of raw meat, and then grill them at the table.  It is not quite like Benihana, in that 1) there is not a chef doing entertainment-cooking in front of you, and 2) you are not in a mixed party.  Our waitress did come by from time to time to flip the meat , and to cut it with scissors so that it could be eaten with chopsticks.\n\nThe service was quite prompt and pleasant.  The interior of the restaurant was nicely finished, although the 2-person bench seats on each side of the table are so heavy that it makes it difficult to manhandle them into a comfortable position.  \n\nThe grilled dumplings were tasty; but oddly my girlfriend's less expensive beef tasted markedly superior to my pricer order.  \n\nOne thing that was irksome were the televisions.  They were showing women's college softball on ESPN 8 or something, and it was just annoying and distracting, cheapening the feel of what was otherwise a refined restaurant.  Why anyone installs TV's in restaurants other than sports bars is beyond me.  \n\nThe food was ok without being great.  Nothing that made me say \"we HAVE to come here again!\"  Prices seemed fair ($50 for the 2 of us, including tip, and we ate pretty well).  I admit I am terrible at using chopsticks, and so getting food into my mouth without making a mess is a challenge.  I didn't ask if they had forks, knives, spoons, but I was thinking about it.\n\nWhen we left, we were the only patrons.  I wonder if Gangnam BBQ will be able to dial up their food to match the good service and beautiful interior.  I will be rooting for them, but don't know how soon I will be rushing back."

Price is fair for the type and quality of the meat they serve. So awesome! Bibimbap so tasty. They also have filet mignon which is rare to find in other Korean Bbq places. A must place to go to if you're craving for Korean food when you're in town."

Kobe Ssam (Uni dish)\n5. Uni Bibimbap\n6. Spicy soft tofu soup\n7. Side of white rice \n\nTotal bill came out to $78.52 for 2 of us before tax  so $90ish after 15% tip. \n\nI would say the food was 3/4 Korean and 1/4 Japanese style bbq. Korean sides are free and unlimited and if u \"volunteer\" writing a yelp review u get a free dessert  not the reason I am writing one but hey free is free...\n\nOverall value & price I would say 4.5 out of 5 but with the good customer service it bumps to a 5! Would come back here next time I'm in town! :)\n\n\nUpdate:\nCame back a 2nd time in 3 days and got the bulgolgi beef bowl to go! :)"

There was also a projection screen playing a combination of Asian and American pop videos which was pretty amusing.  \nThere was a variety of menus options which was typical for Korean BBQ.  So if you've ever been to one of these places, the food is as good as you cook it.  I was surprised by the edamame...a buttery garlic delight. The green tea cheese cake was much better than expected. \nThe bottom line is that this place is pretty good and I would definitely come here again when in the mood for #cookedbyme cuisine."

            "review": "So Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining has been opened for awhile, but I only just noticed it very recently.  It is a Japanese and Korean DIY BBQ restaurant, where you can order items a la carte or from one of their many preset combinations.  It is a similar concept to Yagu (on the West side) and many other J or KBBQ restaurants in California.\n\nBased on reading the past reviews (very helpful in convincing me to drive to this side of town for just a meal and go then back) and the photos posted for this business and comparing it to my first hand experience here, I can deduced that the restaurant has experimented with various promotions before settling on their current all day Happy Hour promotion.  Gone are their lunch special menu or previous versions of their HH menu.  Now you get 1/2 off selected beverage items and discounted menu items.\n\nThe food I was served was good and tasted even better when cooked properly and to the exact doneness that I want.  And since it was not AYCE, I did not felt subconsciously compelled to overindulge during the meal with the final destination dangerously close to meat coma station.  Price was reasonable, not cheap when you add everything up, but you get good quality for the price.\n\nThe server was very friendly and helpful, as was the owner or the restaurant manager/model (yeah, she definitely exudes the essence of Gangnam style). The restaurant itself looks very nice (posh with well executed design and decoration).\n\nSuggested party size for dining here is up to 4 per table, as you have to share the grill built into the table.  Don't wear anything that you don't want smelling like it was generously sprayed with the delicious smell of sweet BBQ smoke after you leave or have a change of cloth for going back to work. Best time to come is after work so you can take advantage of their HH drink specials without having to feel like an alcoholic for the 2nd part of your work day.\n\nBulgogi, Korean Prime Short Rib and the Kurobuta (Japanese Pork) Sausage was what I ordered to be grilled and is what I would recommend to others trying out this restaurant.  No free banchan here, but you can order their Kimchee and Pickles (both are $0.00) to compliment your meal.\n\nSolid 4 stars experience based on the service, food, atmosphere and price to value."

            "review": "Went here for dinner tonight. Since I was alone, they asked me if I would like to sit at the bar and like a fool I said Yes, not realizing that it meant not getting to grill my own meat. Oh Well... You live, you learn.(I wish they had told me that though).\n\nThey started me off with a plethora of side dishes and accompaniments which all eventually went really well with the meats and a bowl of white rice; everything except a random macaroni salad that is which I didn't quite understand being there. \nI ordered the Kobe Beef which was the main reason I went here and the Garlic Calamari which they recommended. They serve 6 pieces of beef and some sea salt which you absolutely must sprinkle on. It enhances the flavor exponentially. This was my first time eating Kobe Beef and I now understand what all the hype is about. It was just juicy, so flavorful, so amazingly tender. Without a shadow of a  doubt the best quality beef I've ever had.  They did overcook it a tad and it was medium-well which is maybe how they do it, but for such a cut I would most certainly have preferred a mid-rare. Very highly recommended, even though it's ridiculously pricey.\nThe Garlic Calamari was a huge fail. They were cooked well and tender but had no flavor at all and I had to douse them in hot sauce and soy to finish them.\n\nOverall this was an awesome meal. I would definitely love to go back here and try some more cuts and also grill them myself this time by getting a table instead of sitting at the bar. It's actually pretty reasonable(except the Kobe obviously) considering how much meat they serve. Definitely recommended."

We ordered veggie bibimbap, scallops, calamari, shrimp, mushrooms, onions, dynamite shrimp appetizer, asparagus, and king oyster mushroom. Also, hirami steak for me. Mainly seafood & veg bc my husband doesn't eat meat. The dynamite shrimp didnt come out until halfway through our meal. It was supposed to be appetizer. I think the server forgot to put it in bc he didnt write our order down. I think he got offended that I asked if he was going to write anything down. Oh well. Food was ok. I prefer gyu kaku. Faster service & better taste imo. We ordered the honey toast & it took fooorreever. Literally 20 min. The girl asked us twice what flavor icecream and she still gave us the wrong ones. If you've had honey toast in Hawaii, you know that the bread inside is usually hollowed out, cut into cubes & toasted with butter & drizzled with honey. This place did neither of those things. They left the bread inside whole & scooped icream on top. It was so hard to eat. We tried cutting it but it became a disaster & was so messy. We took a few bites & left it. The lazy male server was busy talking to another female server and left another female to clean off 2 of his tables & ours. He just kept yapping & didnt lift one finger to help clean off his own table. Unbelievable. The tip should go to the girls who helped us & kept checking on us but im sure they share tips. Would not come again."

It's located in a shopping plaza next to a tattoo parlor.\n-They have a nice selection of combos and tapas.  We went w/ the Gangnam combo which in the end was too much food (and I hate wasting food, but didnt want to walk around with a backpack smelling of KBBQ).

Service was fast, friendly, and all of the dishes tasted excellent.  Well worth the trip off strip if you're in the mood for tasty Korean!"

Even though the layout is more for the modern hipster crowd our kids still had a good time cooking their own food on the grill.  Both me and my wife had the spicy ramen with egg which came out piping hot and had a nice kick to it.  The kids had rice and bulgogi was sweet and very tender.  The restaurant itself feels very upscale but the prices are reasonable.  Only gripe is there were 7 groups ahead of us which is not really their fault and they were still able to seat us in 25 minutes.  All in all good food and would definitely come again."

I like to come here with my girlfriend because the booths make me feel like I'm in a private place. The restaurant looks like it is brand new and I enjoy the music videos that they play on their projection which is a mix of Korean, American Pop, and some funny ones like Boy Dance Party from SNL. If you get Kristin as a server, you're in great hands! She is very helpful at suggesting food items and checks on our table at a consistent rate. She actually looks like she enjoys her job and enjoys serving you . The staff has always been attentive with my water also as I am a fast drinker. Their servers speak fluent English too \n\nMy usual order consists of brown rice, kimchi (free), salmon jalape\u00f1o poppers (sooo good), 2 orders of toro beef and 2 orders of pork belly. The owner is friendly, and willing to help out with anything . \n\nThis is my favorite Korean BBQ spot in Vegas , check it out!"

The chicken fried rice has huge chunks of chicken which was nice to see. \n\nThanks to the happy hour menu we tried the Bulgogi which was marinated to perfection and the waiter helped us cook it. Also had the garlic shrimp which was good. I've always been nervous about he little side dishes you receive but everything was so good! Minus the pasta salad thing which didn't seem to fit.\n\nProbably the most perfect end to our Vegas vacation!\n________________________________________________\n\nAfter submitting my review we were ignored for a good half hour. Our waiter was too busy being FED by a friend across the restaurant. Really? I get if you're friends come in to eat and you want to say hi or chit chat for a few minutes, but to completely abandon your table? That's rediculous. Actually nobody checked on us during that time, we had to flag a waitress down who really didn't seem to care. Finally a second waitress stopped by and asked how we were doing. They were having a promotion if you wrote a Yelp review your got a free dessert, so we showed our reviews and then waited and waited and waited for dessert. The waitress was very apologetic and even gave us macaroon ice cream for free, on top of our 2 free desserts. The only reason this isn't a 1 star reviews is because the food was amazing and the last waitress to help us was very nice and helpful."

However, for the location, the food and the service, I will definitely be coming to this place, again and again...\n\nA.  Location - Harmon, Swenson, Paradise.  There is a small strip mall there that has plenty of food choices and this location is perfect for so many.  Right across from Hard Rock....\n\nB.  The Service - extremely efficient and pleasant. I came here for lunch and while it was not terribly busy, the server was just right in being very efficient, always there when you wanted her, very nice and top notch.\n\nC.  The Menu - Loved the menu.  The cuts here are smaller in size and also more reasonable in portion and pricing. You can order a huge variety of different meats, seafood and veggies all ranging in prices form 3.00 to 12.00 per plate.  I loved the mix and match. IF I brought my glasses and had more time, I would have done this.  Instead, I turned over the menu to the combo page and pre-ordered one of the combos to make it easier for me.\n\nD.  The Food- \n\na.  Miso Soup - OK, so we are in a Korean restaurant and they serve Miso soup. I find that odd, and at same time I really cannot complain since it was tasty.  However, when I am eating BBQ, I like the real basic soup that is plain and simple.\n\nb.  The meats - \n\nChicken Tender Cheese Fondue -   OK, I am not a huge non traditional foodie, but man, this was really cool and tasty.\n\nBulgogi - Wow was that really fast and the sauce was PERFECT.\n\nFilet Mignon - So tender and juicy...\n\nShrimp Garlic - Would have preferred Shrimp PRAWN, but these tiny morsels were okay.\n\nHarami Miso - Man was this steak just right. Never had it before and I really enjoyed it.\n\nAssorted Veggies - Cool. Normal stuff. but those corn on the cob were awesome.\n\nc.The appetizers - Again, miso soup, rice, salad and some kind of cream cheese wonton thing.  Different, okay. I prefer banchan.\n\nE.  Come back factor - This is one cool place, the food is good, the portions are manageable so you can try different things for sure.  For business lunch, hanging out, this is a really nice restaurant and I do plan to come back.  If I am focused only on the bbq, I may try Tofu Hut or other places DJK, but I really enjoyed this Gangnam BBQ.\n\nGK says, check it out."

Although the restaurant is not located centrally on the Strip, it's worth making the trip (by cab) out to Paradise Road just to go to Gangnam Korean BBQ.  If you're looking for authentic food instead of your typical chain restaurants located on the Strip, eat here!"

I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap, and was sadly disappointed with the selection. It was rice and bulgogi....that was it. The waitress came by and she even look as displeased at me. What was surprising was that she didn't do anything about it, which was saddening. I can't say that it was their fault, since that's what I ordered, but if a customer looks dissatisfied it should raise an alarm to do something about it! Learn from this, the restaurant has potential."

The deokbokki was perfectly al dente though, and the kalbi was also super tender. The food comes out fairly quickly and the staff was very pleasant. The bill came out to be about $35 a person.

I'll say that the food here is top notch- both taste and quality. even the atmosphere is pleasant, which can't always be found for an authentic Korean food experience. the best thing by far though is the service. all the waiters and waitresses are extremely attentive and generous. the price comparatively is steep but probably not by Vegas standards. overall, a total must try! definitely making it back here someday soon."

The marinated kalbi was perfect and the portions were decently generous. The only issue was the side dishes, which I didn't think were great. Most of the pickled items seemed a little dry, and the overall selection/variety of the banchan was mediocre. I guess I'm used to Korea, where the side dishes are as important as part of the meal. I was also not impressed with the chicken karaage which they used chicken breast for (made it dry)."

It is centrally located so it is perfect for anyone looking for a good BBQ place. Even though there were only two servers tonight they did a pretty good job overall. It started to get packed as the evening went on so I knew that this place was good. I tried a lot of things actually: prime kalbi, bulgogi, pork belly, oysters, miso soup, and even dessert. I wish I could have tried everything but I will save that for the next time I will be there. I even have a feeling that the owner/manager was out and about seating customers, smiling, and making people feel comfortable and right at home. To top it off, they have a projector screen on the wall to provide a little entertainment while you are cooking or enjoying your food. My server, Kristin, was very nice, polite, and outgoing. She really took care of me, always asked if everything was okay, and making sure I was never thirsty. How can you get better than that? I would recommend Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining to anyone who wishes to have great food, great service, and very reasonable prices."

Here's what we ordered: \n\n- fried calamari, 2/5\n- chicken karaage, 4/5\n- beef toro, 3/5\n- pork belly, 3/5\n- beef bulgogi, 3/5\n\nEverything was mediocre. Nothing out of the ordinary and pricey for the size of the portions. We ended up ordering 3 orders of the beef toro! What really gave this place low stars was the service. They were nice and all but seriously nowhere to be found whenever we needed anything. Our orders too on forever to come out and after the long drive, we just wanted to eat! Also, our grill was literally on fire until someone casually came out and changed it. Our server also made weird, awkward, borderline inappropriate jokes and just gave the whole experience a weird vibe. \n\nDon't think I'll be back.

The meat is a good quality, and the salad was fresh, we liked the mushrooms they gave us to grill in a foil pack, and the corn.  \n\nWe ordered the Gangnam special for 2 people, and a side dish of corn cheese. I have had different type of corn cheese in la, so this one was just ok to me.. maybe a little too creamy? and it didn't get really burned on the bottom of the cast iron dish it was, (neither did the bulgogi bibimbap, but it was still tasty).  Ended up paying around $90 including tip for 2 people, and we did not have any drinks, just water.\n\nOverall I would say that the quality and taste of this place is pretty good, however it is a little pricy if you are expecting typical korean bbq stuff. For example, the Gangnam didn't include Brisket, or Pork belly, which is usually one of our staples for korean bbq. It did however include some oysters, which was nice (although I don't like oysters too much myself).  We are used to korean bbq in california, where you can get AYCE ranging as low as $9.99-$30 per person, and I'm also used to wrapping my korean bbq in radish and rice paper and a plethora of sesame oil plus salt and pepper sauce, and lots of sliced green onion.\n\nYou can order meat ala carte, so they do have a customizable menu based on how much you want to try/order....\n\nThe side dishes were pretty good, I liked the fish cake, etc."

Loved the kalbi but not the belly. After dinner we had dessert. I ordered the friend banana tempura with strawberry ice cream and Man oh Man! Their banana tempura is the best of its kind! Better than PF Changs banana spring rolls. It's worth every calories! I'll probably come back just to order this. :)"

We ordered the prime kalbi and it was sooooo chewy. i never had kalbi like that before .. Maybe becuz im from LA. We also ordered the steamed egg.. But it was like a souffle..

We didn't pick any of their packages since there were some items we did not want. We had prime Kalbi (decent but I've had much better in KC and LA), pork belly, beef Toro, Tongue, and mushroom medley (this comes out cooked already for you). All in all the service was excellent, food was great but I think we had better in LA and Kansas City. I thought the best cut of meats was way better in Kansas City. Maybe the mid-west have better cuts of meat??? Since we got there after 10 PM it was happy hour so a lot of our items were priced lower than usual so that was a big plus. We both had all the food for about $40. For the price and great service,  I would still recommend this place and I would come back again soon."

Our total was only $46 including tip (which is a great deal for 2 people when you're used to LA prices). The food was good quality and they give you plenty of side dishes. We didn't even really need the edamame and seaweed salad so we probably could have gotten away with spending under $40 for 2 people.

They basically don't have a tracking system of what you got. I will never waste money here again. Overpriced for what you get. It's not all you can eat. The meat trays are so small."

I love korean bbq, I love japenese bbq, but I've never tried both at the same time. Where to start?\n\nStaff was nice, only took about 7 1/2 minutes in between to refill my water from when it was empty and full. Ordered that $70 combo meal with a side of pork belly.\n\nSauces came out and dropped off with no description, but thank god for having taste buds I were able to figure out what each sauce was.\n\nMeats came out before all the appetizers, and I guess raw oysters were to serve as my dessert? Lol.. The filet mignon did not go well with my raw oysters, as well as my super sweet and sauced up bibimbap. Teriyaki sauce galore I guess.\n\nMeat quality was probably close to tofu hut which would of been nice if they had a $10 AYCE.\n\n\nHouse salad was meh, soup was meh meh, everything meh. Granite the staff was nice and lagged on getting stuff for us, like water, dropped chopsticks, and napkins and all that. No biggie I'm asian, I'm use to eating with my hands.\n\nI normally don't like to bash on businesses but I feel like this place has gotten way more love than they should. All the 4 or 5 star ratings might have come from drunks or people with no taste buds. Best of luck to this place, yelp you failed me."

However, I recommend cooking it yourself, that's all part of the fun! \n\nThe staff was friendly and attentive. And if you get distracted like I did and over cook some of the meat, no worries, they come and replace your grill cover with a clean one! \n\nMy husband started with the fried calamari (cooked outback) and I had miso soup (also cooked out back) and then we ended up sharing some spicy chicken, pork, and two different beefs! \n\nTotal worth it and highly recommended.

My friend and I went back there today for lunch and we had the bugogi special for $5 and japchae for $10. Both were excellent. This time we were able to get the kitchen to cook food. Will go back here next time we visit Vegas. \n\nHere again yesterday for dinner and today for lunch. Still consistently excellent with generous portions. Will come here again with my friend before we depart LV next week."

The rest were not anything special but I liked that they were unlimited.\nWhen we went, they were offering free dessert in exchange for a Yelp! review so it would have been rude not to. You get to choose between a free plate of banana tempura with ice cream or a macaron ice cream sandwich (only coffee flavour was left and I'm glad we never paid for it)."

Which would've been perfect but we never got our sides that came out with it. It says you get complimentary sides, and they just never came. We also ordered an extra side of rice, again never came. Basically when ever we ordered things, it either came out super late or not at all. Service is also slow and not attentive at all. I guess we made it inbetween shifts because near the end, we didn't see our waitress at all and a new server took the rest of our order. It wouldn't have been bad, but it would've been considerate to just let us know. We waited way too long for everything. \n\nI will not be coming back purely because of the experience.

Even if something dissapoints you, I guarantee there is another little plate that could make you happy. Which is why you should come here with a small group.

Who can beat four thousand reviews and 4.5 star rating? \n\nThe servers here seem to be pretty nice and the customer service is pretty good. I didn't have any issues with ordering food or having things come out too late. \n\nThe meat quality is alright. I ordered the Korean Prime Kalbi, Prime Kalbi, and Harami Miso which looked amazing, but it was the ultimate blue ball. They were well marbled which I loved, but it was surprisingly tough... what a disappointment. The beef looked to be on par with that of Magal Korean BBQ, but when you bite into it, you can tell that there is a huge difference in quality. The banchan here was surprisingly good, but the bibim nangmyun was not quite where I wanted it to be. They need to put less chilled broth in it because it was almost indistinguishable from mul nangmyun. \n\nThe only redeeming quality of this place is the price. I ordered 3 plates of beef and an order of Bibim Nangmyun and it came out to roughly $50 with tax and tip. If I were to order the same stuff at Magal, it would be roughly $80 to $90.\n\nAll in all, this is a so-so korean bbq spot that made me reminiscent of home, but it was nothing spectacular. The service is good, but the beef quality is forgettable. After my experience here, I was wondering how so many people could think this place is so damn amazing, but then I saw a little sign on our table. They offer free macaron ice cream for every review that is written. They pretty much bribe people into writing good reviews for a free dessert. \n\nIf you come here looking for Korean BBQ nirvana, keep on looking. If you want a moderately priced and decent quality BBQ joint, this may be for you. Just don't expect amazing things from here."

We did the Paradise A combo ($56 for two ppl).  our server said it was the most popular choice.\n\nthere was easily enough food for 3 people!  everything was tasty!  Five starters and five dishes to BBQ. I especially liked the spicy dumplings from the starters, and all the meat was top quality.\n\nService was very helpful and attentive, without being annoying.  Great place for date night (slightly romantic, but more hip and cool).  we will definitely be back!!"

The place was 50% full when we went there round 8pm. However, I think this place draws a late crowd as it is open until 2 am. Attractive staff and modern style furnished the space. \n\nBe aware when sitting down. Check for water from the exhaust hood above. As Korean BBQ gets hot and the ac runs cold to keep it cool, condensation builds and can drip on to the table or seat. The underside of my shorts got wet when I slid into the bench style seat. (-1 star).\n\nThis place is good for 2-4, and larger tables of 8 are in the back. Super fast service! Don't be shy to flag the servers down. 3 people ran the front of the house. All 3 were at out table at some point.\n\nWe ordered a set combination of things and every bit was great. They prepared bibimbap table side and opened our mushroom foil pouch too. The grill didn't get too hot but would try this place in the winter time.\n\nThe good was of high quality and at some point, thought it may be too much. Food, 4 beers, house sake = $85 before tip. Not bad!"

The presentation was great, and everything tasted very fresh. Free sides and great quality meats for sure. The two pre marinated meats were great, but my personal preference is to cook the meat dry and use the dipping sauces. The \"Macaron\" ice cream sandwiches are awesome too. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back to check out happy hour and some of the other unique menu items. Ps: come get your free dessert!"

My party of 3 was famished so we went to town on the happy hour menu; available everyday 3pm-6pm and again at 10pm-12:45am) - the HH menu isn't huge, but it had a good variety so we stuck to it. \n\nThey only offer complimentary side dishes (banchan) with a minimum of 2 BBQ dishes per person, but we had no problem meeting that quota. All of the sides offered were fresh and flavorful - we also enjoyed extra rounds. Also, they offered 3 dipping sauces light, medium, and a dark one. They were all tasty but my favorite was definitely the darkest one - it was salty, sweet and a bit spicy. \n\nHH items we tried:\nCream cheese wontons - 4/5\nSweet corn - 5/5 (very sweet and buttery but tiny)\nMushroom medley with butter - 4/5\nGarlic in butter - 5/5\nJalapeno poppers - 5/5 (delicious)\nKorean chicken cheese fondue - 3/5\nSpicy pork - 4/5\nPork belly - 5/5 (we loved this the most!)\nBulgogi - 3/5\n\nWhen dining outside of happy hour, the regular menu is massive so I'm sure you will be able to find something, even for the the pickiest of eaters. Also, pricing seemed fairly competitive with Gyu-Kaku (their direct competitor.) The grill tops and ventilation setup at each table worked very well; they conveniently changed out our charred grill per our request and the restaurant wasn't smokey or smelly.\n\nAfter the feast you know we all needed a cup of caffeine to snap us out of the food coma.\n\nGood times!"

They've updated their service and I can say their staff are very friendly and service oriented. They have fast service and their meats are great. However, the taste is somewhat so-so and came across as the same on their variety of meats - sweet.\n\nMaybe we should have ordered the cooked bulgogi instead of the set menu Gangnam BBQ that we have to grill ourselves. I would probably return just to try out their cooked dishes, but will definitely check out other KBBQ resto first whenever we visit LV."

The not marinated one was the best thing I had this meal. The beef tongue was aight. If it was sliced a bit thinner or a bit thicker it would've been great. Pork belly was typical pork belly. We cooked it to crispy. The filet mignon was meh. Would skip. We also got the king oyster mushroom. It was aight. \n\nGet the prime kalbi. So good. So fat. So worth. \n\nAlso get the sesame oil with sea salt. It's well worth the one dollar. Adds a lot of flavor to the meats. \n\n\nAlso free dessert if you do Yelp reviews rn. ;D"

During my first visit they were very attentive and accommodating to all our requests. However, the second time they barely came around and we had to ask for more food to random servers that passed us by. They didn't fill our water once or ask us if we wanted another serving and it took them forever to even give us the check. Maybe it was an off night, but there wasn't a lot of people so it couldn't have been because they were busy. Hopefully third times a charm!"

I can say without a doubt that this is as good if not better than some of the places I have eaten at in Korea Town in NYC. The fact that this place is off the strip makes it even better as most people who frequent it are avid fans of Korean cuisine rather than a bunch of tourists."

Unlike other Korean restaurant, this one did not have the overwhelming smell of grease & grilled meat.  \n\nWe had a spicy tuna kimbap, prime kalbi (beef), spicy chicken w/ lemon, & asparagus. All items were very good. The beef & chicken were grilled at the table. They were nicely seasoned. Right portions for us. \n\nThe spicy tuna kimbap was chunks of tuna in mayonnaise laced with sriracha sauce, served over rice balls wrapped in nori, lightly battered and deep fried. It was very tasty. \n\nPieces of prime kalbi were tender & very good. I preferred them grilled rare. The spicy chicken pieces were well marinated and tasted real good when lightly dipped in lime juice. The asparagus was cooked yet lightly crunchy, the way I liked. Every thing went well with the Sapporo beer on draft. \n\nWe finished our meal with banana tempura served with vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream. I wished I ordered a cup of black coffee to go with it. \n\nOur server was professional & friendly. She was running a bit ragged because she had many tables to attend to. \n\nWe will definitely return to this restaurant the next time we are in Las Vegas, NV."

The NY strip was flavorless."

The grill isn't sticky like other places I've been and it isn't smokey. \n\nMy favorite dish is the Korean galbi. It's not too salty and has a nice marbling of fat without being fatty. The combination of sweet meats with enoki mushrooms coupled with a sweet onion and perfectly steamed rice keeps me coming back time and time again. \n\nWhen you've had enough of the overpriced food from the overhyped restaurants on the strip, hop over to gangnam for a great meal the whole family will enjoy at a price that will keep you at the poker table a little longer."

Don't get me wrong the servers have been doing their best to serve / attentive and quick to respond , it is just that the service level has fallen behind a typical Korean BBQ restaurants . For instance, the extractor fan was not on (or was not working) all time it was hot by then and our clothes were left super delicious; they never bothered to change the burnt charred black grill, and  unlike many other Korean BBQ when meats arrived they never cut it into smaller size for you to grill."

The menu says they are for 2 people but we had a group of 4 and the combo filled us all.  You can always add one or two items a la carte if you are still hungry.\n\nThe meat is surprisingly well marbled and tender and fresh.  The sauces are perfect compliments to the meet.\n\nI thought the salad was a little bit of an afterthought as it was mostly lettuce but we still ate it.\nOur favorite was the bulgogi bibambap.\n\nThe service felt a little off as they had a difficult time understanding and we were very conscious that they were watching us the whole time.  I understand it is your job to clear our table as we finish a plate but there are ways to be less intrusive about it. Also, they were fixing a light in the restaurant while we were all there.  Still, this place is very enjoyable and reasonably priced."

Alternatively, I had the beef toro to myself; it was very fatty, in fact tasted like the fat on a grilled steak which I love but husband doesn't eat fat on purpose...(!) Get the bulgogi bibimbap instead of white rice; it's a more interesting rice dish with beef in it. Only had 1 piece of the broccoli cheese fondue, was just so much food something had to give!

Open late so there isn't an excuse to not come by and try it out. \n\nPricing is very reasonable for the quality of food. Try it for yourself!"

Nothing seems to be memorable.  The kimchi  rice is NOT kimchi fried rice at all.  It tastes more like teriyake fried rice.  My kids love it.  It's nothing compared to K-Town bbq down in LA.  I would think Vegas would have better Korean BBQ than this.  If you are close-by, it's worth for a meal.  But if you need to Uber there, it's not worth the trip.  There are plenty other options on the Strip."

Kalbi was okay. Meat was tough but marinade was good.\n\nI am actually writing this review as we sit at this table and await our server to come by to ask if we need anything for once.

In looking around it was brilliant as there are many sushi restaurants in LV and 2 in the same shopping center as Gangnam (btw really I should have known better) so the owner thought hey we can serve Korean and then bribe yelpers with free dessert for the 2k worth of reviews. For all you yelpers that sold out for dessert SHAME.....ding ding.......SHAME!!!!!\n\nIt's not the worst place if you don't know better and could get 3 stars tops but I feel duped as I fell for the 2 thousand plus reviews. \n\nAnyway do your homework and look for authentic KBBQ ."

Anyway, my husband and I went there for our long awaited date night and we were blown away. Our waitress was very helpful with her suggestions (which were delicious, btw) and she was always available to help even before we knew we needed help. The restaurant isn't buffet style like we're used to but their dinner options were so huge that the servers were constantly bringing new dishes before we can so much as say \"too bad it's not buffet\". Everything was perfect but my official favorite is the bulgogi fried rice. Gangnam, you've found two new fans! We'll be back! And we'll definitely be bringing friends and family next time. :D"

I like the low key music video playing on the large screen you can choose to ignore or enjoy. \n\nAs for the food, the Tuna Poki was fantastic - not fishy at all and the combo of tuna, seaweed and radish was fab. The spicy edamame - awesome. Lastly, the Fire Cracker Shrimp was no joke. It is not for the faint of heart, but if you love spicy food like I do, you will love the combination of crunch, spice and a bit of sweet. It was really tasty.\n\nWould definitely come back again,"

We thought it would be good bec. of how good the reviews seem to be... however, just like most Yelp Reviews... it was all hype. (I'm starting to think that the reviews are mostly fake). \n\nFirst off, the host told us that we had about 35-45 min. of wait. So, my bestfriend and I decided we could wait for it. An hour passed, after checking in with the host, he now tells us that reservations come in first, before we get to sit. Since we've already waited for so long... my bestfriend didn't want to leave. So we waited another hour, for a total of TWO HOURS! \n\nWhen we were finally sat on our table, we thought, Finally!!! Guess what? We had to wait an extra 30 min for a waiter/waitress to take our order and we weren't even in a hidden area!!! The person who were in line  five people after us even got their food first!!! \n\nSo I finally asked the host for help and he took our order and checked up on us. I don't know who our designated waiter/waitress was but there was this girl waitress who was giving us an attitude, slamming the lettuce order we've ordered on the table. We were just too hungry and to even bother paying attention to her. \n\nThe food was just like any other BBQ place. You cook your own food. As usual, they didn't marinate the shrimp and squid long enough for the flavor to cling when barbequed. The food wasn't worth the inconveniece. \n\nI understand the long wait in line to be seated. I also would have understood if it would take a few minutes for food to get ready. However, it is absolutely not understandable when the waiter/waitress would ignore you completely; taking 30 minutes to take your order... when you were sat first. Then, needing to flag someone to take your order.\n\nI actually felt bad for the host because he took our orders and was acting like our waiter... when that's really not his job to do. So we decided to give him the tip. (HOWEVER, upon giving him the tip he said he was actually the manager). Thus, I felt irritated all the way home.\n\nAs the manager it was his responsibility to ensure that guests are all attended to. I will never go back to this place again and I will advise other family members, group of friends, other government co-workers to completely skip this one. It's not worth the wait. Not worth the trouble. Food places are meant to be fun, relaxing, not troublesome."

You get a lot of pre-marinated meats/veggies/etc brought out to you and you cook it yourself on the mini-grill. It's so easy a 7 year old could do it (or my older brother who hardly gets credit for cracking an egg).\n\nI recommend you get one of the pre-designed samplers. We opted for The paradise A  and we got more than enough food for two.  The Harami Miso, prime kalbi, and calimari were all yummy.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who is staying in Las Vegas.

The original bibimbap was yummy (nothing extraordinary but solid and at least normal portion size).  The chocolate lava cake was delicious.  Warm and gooey. \n\nThe not so good: side dishes were icky.  So sad because half the fun of Korean food are the yummy side dishes.  The seafood pancake was tiny and for $9.50, so not worth it.   We are normally huge fans of seafood pancake but just so tiny here (two small silver dollar pancake size ones and at most places you get one the size of a dinner plate).   The pork belly app was so so.  \n\nOur waitress was really nice though it took a while to get seated and for someone to come and take our order.  \n\nOverall: small portions, pretty good service... But there's gotta be better Korean places in Vegas!"

First the good:   Fantastic seaweed salad and a very presentable mixed greens salad.  The spicy chicken wings are fantastic.  The sauces are a nice touch. Also the make waiter is great (female not too friendly).  The place seems clean and inviting.  I like the squid banchan but not as good as my daughter's  We got the 4 person meat lover.  It was the size we are used to for two people.  The brisket was tough and the shoulder was good.  The filet was flavorful but a little tough.  The banchan was generous. The pork belly is the thin type which is fine with me because I like it crispy. Asahi dark is a good compliment.  Dweji bul gogi is nice and tender and just the right spice.  Overall a very nice experience"

I can handle spicy foods really well and enjoy my mouth on fire, but the *spicy* in spicy seafood ramen was no joke! However, the spiciness did not overpower the flavor of the broth. The kimchee bibimbap was amazing! I was happy to see it served in a stone pot to keep the temperatures piping hot. Servings were huge for such a reasonable price.

The food doesn't take long to be served once ordered, it tastes good and there are plenty of complementary side dishes served with any order. The quality and quantity of the food are good and reasonable and definitely a place I will be visiting for lunch and dinner. Also my first time trying Korean food was this restaurant and my first impression is definitely good . I'd like to try more different Korean food and possibly from here. Bonus: I got a macaron ice cream after doing a yelp check in and it was delicious!"

They have a wide selection of meats and side dishes that I would've never imagined back home."

We shared a meal for two and it fed four people!  Great place for group dining and happy hour!  Staples include the pork belly, brisket and kalbi to name a few must haves.  I like mixing it up when I go to gangnam especially during their happy hour after 10 pm.  Make sure to try the broccoli fondue, sweet corn and mushroom medley.  Only issue is the ventilation as I always leave gangnam with a smokey odor on my clothes.  Desserts are quite delicious so make sure to save some room for the decent variety.  Easy location to reach if you're near the strip as it's located across from the hard rock hotel.  Plenty of parking in the shopping center which has many places to check out."

This happened to be the closest to where we were staying at.  We had the Gangnam option for bbq, and man did we have a lot!  We had so many meat options, and all I can say is that the meats were so tender, and even without any dipping sauces, it had so much flavor.  The sides that came with were also super amazing.  The service was excellent.  Our waiter was amazing - he walked us through all the meats, which ones to eat first and last, and really went above and beyond in making sure we were satisfied with our meals.  Will definitely come back here!"

It's well off the strip, and consequently lacks the pretension of many of the more central eateries, which was very welcome.\n\nWe picked from then menu rather than going for one of their set menus, but everything was delicious. The meats were all tasty, well-seasoned and mouthwatering. The cheese fondue was surprisingly good for its simplicity and worked better than we expected. The Bibimbap was also tasty, although the presence of my children meant I had to choose a less spicy option than I would normally.\n\nThe Korean side dishes were great, although the refills of Kimchi we asked for never materialised. In fact, the slightly chaotic and inattentive service was the only thing that prevents me giving the place the full five."

I've met clients here twice and both were very appreciative. (I was glad for the access to WiFi as well as the great food, service and atmosphere)\n\nI did miss getting the free banchan, but the Kimchee is free upon request. Don't forget to ask. And the price is less than I expected so you can still order little side dishes individually. \n\nGet the Bul-Go-Gi and grill it yourself. \n\nOh and they'll play the Gangnam music video for you on the big screen if you ask. :)"

This place carries a lot of value with the amount of different (yet satisfying) portions/packages that even a poor college student can afford.\n\nMy friend and I got the most basic Las Vegas package since we're hungry but obviously not capable of eating a feast by ourselves. It was $45/person and the amount of food cannot be more fulfilling. You get the tradition side dishes + a house salad, along with rice, sauces and miso soup to go along with your proteins that includes beef, spicy chicken, garlic shrimp and pork.\n\nYou are however required to cook things yourself comparing to places like Honey Pig when a server would occasionally stop by and manage your food. The place wasn't busy at the time we were dining so the servers volunteered to rotate our proteins for us as we were engaged in a deep conversation catching up on life- What a nice touch. \n\nThe ambiance of this place is on the smaller size but comfortable at the least. The service was friendly and attentive and most importantly, the food was amazing for the price that you're paying. I wasn't sure if it was Happy Hour when we dined but when we received our tab, it only came out to be $55. A lot less from what I was expected to pay (hey I'm not complaining) but regardless of it being a mistake or not, I'll happily return."

The prices at happy hour was low enough to be able to try a little bit of everything.  After they tske your order. They turn on the grills amd bring out an assortment of sauces and sides....most of which i had no idea what they were but they were good.

I got the feeling that all the waiters were simply very fast paced and if they thought you didn't need them, they simply scurried about their business. \n\nWe went to Happy Hour right when it started at 3p on a Sunday. The menu is overly large and exciting which made us very indecisive. So we started off ordering only a few things with the plan to order more from there. Here's all of what we ordered and what I thought. \n\nBacon-Wrapped Asparagus - pretty simple and hard to mess up. But with all the other exciting options, I'd pass on it next time. \n\nSweet Cheese Corn - one of my favorites! It was sweet, but not too sweet. And adding cheese never hurts. I would definitely order this again!\n\nFried Wontons - This is obviously of staple of just about every Asian menu. They were yummy as always, but not noticeably different from any other place. \n\nFilet Mignon - Again, very simple. But so enjoyable. Be responsible and don't over-cook it! The meat quality was great and is very tender and delicious when you keep it medium rare. I would order this again. \n\nBulgogi - Very easy to over-cook due to the thin slices. But if you watch it, it comes out very tender and the marinade was everything I wanted! I would definitely order this again!\n\nCream Cheese Wontons - The wonton wrapper was super thin and delicate. It had the perfect light Crunch before breaking through to the cream Cheese. The sweet sauce it came with was great! I would order these again!\n\nChicken Karrage - I had never had this anywhere. So I was surprised to see that the pieces of fried chicken were cut in all different shapes and sizes. In fact, at first I thought the waiter had brought us the wrong thing. I thought it was fried calamari! The chicken itself didn't have much flavor. But the spicy dipping sauce it came with was great! Not sure I'd bother ordering it again, though....\n\nKorean Chicken Cheese Fondue - I enjoyed this chicken even more than I expected! I loved the Crunch that developed from grilling! While the insides remained tender. The cheese came in a little foil bowl. It was shredded and cold and immediately put of the grill. It tasted like an American cheese. I would get this chicken again. \n\nVanilla Ice Cream Macaron Sandwich - the Macaron was purple and I'm not sure what flavor it was meant to be - it simply tasted sweet to me. Even after being frozen, it still had that perfect Macaron chew. And the vanilla ice cream was so creamy and smooth!\n\nWe had a great time at this place and will definitely be back to try more!"

Tons of options and only yourself to blame if it's not cooked right. \n\nGreat appetizers, tons of meats to try, REVERSE HAPPY HOUR 10pm to close. Even if you got something you didn't like (or just messed up cooking it), the prices are great.\n\nSpicy Tuna Kimbap:  awesome as an appetizer to start. The serving is HUGE. You won't feel shorted when you order. You may get scalp sweats, but that's a good thing. \n\nChili Garlic Wings: These were fine, not the best wings you've ever had but pack plenty of meat and flavor.\n\nBulgogi: People seem to love this. It's not great. It's the meat I liked the least. Consistency is gummy. It's a sticky meat. Has a bit of a jerky taste to it. Impossible to really cook on the grill. It's a pass for me. \n\nPork Belly: It was good. It wasn't as flavorful as I thought but it melts in your mouth. They do give you plenty of strips so it works out that way. Plenty of trays to dunk it in too.\n\nFilet Mignon: How could you say no to this? Of course, the cuts are tender and succulent. Probably the thing that works against it is that they are THICK cuts. Eating it usually involves putting the WHOLE chunk in your mouth. But it's filet mignon, it is delicious.\n\nFlat Iron Garlic: Great garlic flavor, thinner cuts make cooking and eating this a tad bit easier that the Filet. Plenty of meat to dip too.\n\nBut really everything we had was good. Even the Bulgogi wasn't that bad. Seems like you can't go wrong here. That's a sign of a great place to eat."

The miso soup was a bit salty but I was surprised to see that there was quite a few small tofu pieces. Other places usually don't have tofu in their miso soup. \n\nWe ordered the meat lovers ($55.95) which is supposed to be good for 2 people. It came with 6 different meats. I wasn't a huge fan of the bulgogi but the filet was amazing. It literally melted in my mouth! If I come back, I'll just order the filet. \n\nSide dishes were ok, nothing special. I wish they gave radish slices instead of tiny pieces of radish though."

I'd suggest to order their korean prime kalbi, brisket, premium beef tongue, kobe style beef, spicy pork, and their filet mignon for meats. They also offer happy hour in which some of the dishes come at a discount that ranges from $2.95-9.95 per tapa order depending on the meats. \n\nMixxed veggies are a good choice for sides, kimchee, japanese pepper, mushroom, and asparagus. The stuff with the cheese sides aren't really worth it. I wasn't too fond of the whole cheese dipping thing, and didn't end up using it. \n\nFor the combos, the first time we came, we ordered the Paradise combo. It says it's good for two people, but we split this with a family of four. We don't eat a lot, but it was still enough to fill us up! Well, we also ordered calamari (which was also good! especially their sauce!) and their fried dumplings (beware. it's really spicy).\n\nThis place is pretty hip, they also have a nice private room for a big party. They feature this big projector screen that plays a mixture of popular music videos from here and Korea. The Korean music videos are so fun to watch even if I don't understand the language. It's a good way to help the time pass. \n\nIt's a fun hip place to go to, but every time I go it's barely full. Maybe one or two areas are taken."

When we got there she told us we were next to get a table so it would probably be 30 minutes or less. We had a party of 11 and we told them that we wouldn't mind splitting our table but they said to just wait for the table in the back. It's understandable that you can't control how long a customer takes but 2 hours later, we're still waiting and are watching for the table the reserved for us. By the time the family that had finished at that table, only one waiter came in to go clean it.. And he didn't even finish cleaning.. It wasn't until another 15 mins later the others realized they needed to finish cleaning it, lol. \n\nThe food came out quickly so it wasn't that bad, but we didn't get our appetizers until after all our food came out.. And the waiter didn't seem really happy and looked mad the whole time, when we asked for somethings he would miss it until we reminded him a couple times. It doesn't kill to fake a smile at the least... They didn't really check on us as much either, we needed a new grill and had to wait until nearly the end as we were finishing our food for it to be replaced.\n\nBut overall, the food was good, I'd give it 4 stars if the service was much better. We ordered the gangnam and Las Vegas pack, they were both filling and the cream cheese wonton appetizers were so good! Made me want more. \n\nOverall I would come back next time, but with a smaller party or splitted party lol"

It took 45 minutes to bring out our beef toro and we asked about it twice, and they said the kitchen is still slicing it. We ordered combo fried rice and specifically said only chicken and beef. They brought it out with shrimp too, and when we told them, our sever said he'll just take out the shrimp for us. Umm.. No.. The rice tastes like shrimp now. Overall service was horrible, has to request more water 3 times, request for the grill to be changed, request for my check after waiting 15 minutes.\n\nThe reviews on YELP are totally FAKE because they offer a free dessert if you review them. No body is going to show them a 1 star review to get a dessert.\n\nDefinitely do not recommend."

Calamari garlic was just ok, not very garlicky.  Broccoli was good, but the cheese fondue was hopelessly separated(tasty though).  To finish it off the Banana tempura was fantastic, choose the green tea ice cream with it. Probably our favorite dessert of our vacation , and it was free for writing this review at the table.

We had a group of 6 and were fine with a meat lover combo for 2 ($55.95) and a couple other sides. The wait staff was very attentive and patient considering we took awhile to figure out what we wanted."

I think we ordered the premium combo with a few a la carte.  I can't remember what meat was what, but I can tell you that some were good and some were ok. The biggest problem with this place is service. \n\nThe only time they stopped off at our table is to take our order, drop off the food, and give us the check. Never came by to pick up empty plates. Had to scream at them to get their attention for ordering more drinks and water. Never came to refill the side dishes. Never checked on our sauce. You get the picture. They didn't even pretend to care and help start cooking."

Mind you, this place is not all you can eat, but the plates of diff meats are decently priced. At approx 6-8 dollars, the portions they give you are very fair. \n\nFor every yelp review, they offer you a free dessert of your choice. \n\nTry the salmon carpaccio and the dynamite shrimp (a bit spicy), but you def won't be sorry! \n\nThey also give you free complimentary sides of various things: Mac salad, fish, spicy cucumber, Kim chi, etc. \n\nWe most definitely will be back!\n\nJust had to add: have the macaroons! They are delicious. I had the mango and green tea and my GF had the vanilla. (She said that the lava cake was not very good though--we waited quite some time and they offered us a free dessert of our choosing). \n\nGreat place and food! Great staff! Great service!"

I have heard so many good things about Gangnam Asian BBQ and finally gave it a try tonight. The ambiance of the interior was really intimate and it was very clean. It really sets the mood for dates or whenever you're in the mood for binge eating KBBQ with your friends, which is what I did. \n\nThe food was delicious! The meats were served fresh and presented nicely. What came to my surprise was that they served Thai Tea, which made my visit even more satisfying. We ordered the miso soup, pork belly, prime kalbi, bugolgi, the bacon wrapped enoki just to name a few and Yuuum! Belly was satisfied! What adds variety of flavor to your meat is the three different sauces they present you with. There is a vinegar like sauce, a sweet sauce, and a spicy sauce, which really gives you multiple choice on flavorings for your food.Of course trying their desserts was a must so I went for the banana tempura. This was so goood. The banana tempura was served hot off the frying pan and what helped balanced that out was the vanilla ice cream. It was a great ending to my meal. The prices overall are perfect for what they serve you.\n\nAll in all I have to say my visit was great! The owner even came out and checked on us. He was so friendly and he looked happy to see his customers. I will be coming back for more!"

I also recommend the bulgogi bibimbap. It was so tasty. Really, there was nothing we did not enjoy. The sides were good and plentiful and the meats were seasoned very well. The only thing we regret is not being able to finish it all because we got so full."

The Korean prime kalbi is also very well marinated and the quality of meat is excellent.  Lastly but no less important is the service.  We didn't come on a very busy night, but the waiters were very quick to remove dishes from our table and refill our beverages.  This makes for an overall great dining experience!"

The meat was average and do not provide the high level of quality that I have come to expect from Los Angeles K-town Korean BBQ restaurants.  They don't have to constantly attend to a table, but we literally had all courses in a meal when we bought the combo brought out within 10 minutes then the servers never returned.  I had to get up multiple times to ask for anything such as napkins, more drinks, etc.  I left full based on the quantity but was expecting the quality to be better. I guess I should've known when their ban-chan (korean side dishes) tasted average at best."

It was so good my girlfriend and I immediately ordered a second plate once we were done. The shishito peppers and mushroom medley were also amazing. Hell, everything we ordered was fresh and delicious and tasted amazing off the grill. Heck even the rice was really good and I'm\nPicky about rice so that's saying something.\n\nWe also ordered a bottle of soju to share (Jinro Chamisul) and it was the perfect drink to go with the meal.\n\nMy only complaint is that they do charge you for the sesame oil which is usually free in most korean BBQ places. But for the amazing prize, potions and quality of food who is complaining?\n\nI would fly back to Vegas just to eat here ;) this place definitely was a huge highlight of my Vegas trip."

I gotta admit I nearly did this myself--it would be awkward to show the server a two-star review when asking for a free dessert, wouldn't it? That's how they getcha.\n\nWe ordered the Meat Lover's BBQ for two, which at ~$56 for a single serving of meat, was obscenely overpriced. In cities with good Korean restaurants and more competition, you can get all-you-can-eat BBQ for $20/person. To top it off, the $56 doesn't even get you lettuce wraps, ssamjang, or sesame oil--you have to pay extra for each. Are you kidding me?\n\nThe meat itself was good. I mean, it's hard to mess up raw meat. However, the grill was electric! That was a first for me, and yet another disappointment with this restaurant. The meat obviously came out with no grill flavor whatsoever, and I could have cooked it better at home.\n\nOur waitress was nice, and she was very good at topping up our water. However, not once did she offer to refill any of the banchan, so we ended up paying $56 for a single serving of meat AND sides. Lastly, she dropped off the check before we were even done, and I had to make several attempts to flag her down so that we could order dessert. She didn't clear the table for dessert, and we had to awkwardly share it among a bunch of empty dishes and leftover food, hunched over the giant table."

We had jalape\u00f1o poppers with salmon (real jalape\u00f1o and it had a great kick!), fried calamari, garlic calamari, beef toro, pork belly, korean chicken with fondue, bulgogi and spicy pork and they are all pretty tasty. The price was also reasonable around $2-$4 for the happy hour dishes and around $4-$9  for non happy hour dishes. The servings are also pretty good sized. \n\nThe only down side is that we had to pay for lettuce and miso which is usually free. I would definitely come back here again."

So rich and they don't short you on the chicken either (in both the noodles and rice). The honey bread dessert was probably the best honey bread I've had. \n\nMy only problem was the service. Our waitress was really rude. We felt rushed when we were trying to order, and while I was still clearly looking at the menu, she asked me to give it back to her. We wanted to order more food but she never came back so decided against it. We waited approximately 15-20 minutes to order dessert and then another 10 for the check. She was doing side work and looking at us but chose not to come over while we sat there waiting. So two other waiters came to help. It was really off-putting. \n\nNevertheless, I'll probably be back because the food was delicious. If the bad service continues however, I'm not sure it'll be worth it."

The serving was hearty, would definitely order again. My partner ordered the BBQ lunch special: 1 item $9.99, 2 item $12.95. Hearty serving as it comes with salad, a few sides like kim chee, etc., and rice. Lots of flavor.\n\nAmbience is awesome, there's 2 tv screens, music in the background, loud enough to hear and enjoy. The decor is hip, chill and clean. The workers are professional and friendly, a place you have to check out and worth the trip if you want to escape from the strip for a couple hours."

Appetizers, kimchis, salads, rice and tons of meat.\n\nEverything we tried was great...the bulgogi and the pork were my absolute favorite meats.  I also loved the seaweed salad and the different Kimchi.\n\nThe music, was an interesting choice to say the least...not sure it fits the atmosphere.  We came on a Sunday night and it was gangster rap...it made us literally laugh out loud because of how out of place it was in a place like this.\n\n\nThe price was also not bad at all.  It ended up after tax and tip being about $40 a person for the 3rd package option..I don't remember the name.  You can get it down to as low as $20 per person on the package if you wanted to leave a few things out.\n\nI would absolutely come back here again.  We all had a great time!"

The best thing is that it's not AYCE & whatever is left overs you can take home. \nThe Korean prime Kalbi is so good! A must try. \nWe also likes enoki with  bacon!\n\nOur waitress was also very sweet, she even charged my phone for me. \n\nThe sauces , you get three. And they all were great! \n\nDespite the menu saying you have to pay for the salt sauce, it's complimentary. \n\nIll update more once this food coma passes!"

Pretty decent sized menu with a lot of good options. There were 8 of us and we were all pretty hungry. We ordered a ton of food. Of the banchan was ok. The favorite was surprisingly the fish cakes. I ordered the bulgogi bibimbab and the cream cheese wontons (really just cream cheese inside\n...) while almost everyone else ordered BBQ. The two least excited about it got fried rice and tried everyone's dishes. The bulgogi bibimbab was delicious. Perfectly cooked and flavored bulgogi. The rice was nice and crispy like it should be and the spicy sauce for it was a little sweet and a little spicy. Perfect dish! Everyone really enjoyed their first Korean BBQ experience. Would love to go back next time we visit"

Unfortunately here is no salad and rice is not include, but , can be purchased for extra cost.\nThe Beef toro is really tender so we ordered two plates of it. I would also recommend all the chicken items. Not only that all of them were three dollars,but it was really juicy and tender. I was not disappointed with anything. \nThe grill does burn a bit but we only needed to change it once. \nThe side dishes were cake, spicy cucumbers, sweet suit, kimchi, pickled onions and macaroni cheese. \nThe service is really good. The waitresses were all really nice and kept checking on us. \nThe location is a bit far from where I live. It is tucked in with a Cvs and a hot dog place."

They aren't exactly set up for people waiting but got us drinks (yuzu soju was CRAZY good and so was the ginger soju cooler if not a little sweet).  We waited forever.  and ever.  and ever.  \n\nThe we finally sat and ate the best freaking korean bbq ever.  The pickles, the appetizers (spicy tuna kimbap) totally unnecessary but SO tasty.  We got the meat lover package deal and it did not disappoint.  Everything was amazing - pork belly, bulgogi, we were FIGHTING over the last pieces of spicy pork.  Just so crazy good.  It took hours but we were so stuffed and happy and barely rolled ourselves back to the hotel.  Totally recommend."

I like how they treat you as you are walking in and very friendly servers! \n\nHint: Happy hour specials!! Seems like the owner is re-inventing the menu every so often for the better!"

On weekends their lot can get pretty busy but, the hunt for a parking spot is worth it once you start grilling. My favorite item is the spicy pork. Leave it on the grill to get it extra crispy. Those charred edges give it a wonderfully crunchy texture to go with a moderately spicy profile. The prime kalbi was my second favorite. I loved the sweetness of the marinade that paired nicely with the natural savoriness of the marbled meat. Other items tried included tender chunks of filet, four decent sized garlic shrimp, and assorted vegetables (corn, mushrooms, peppers, onions, zucchini, and more). Portions run a little small, so it's best to order two or three items per person.\n\nWith a clean, intimate, dark interior it's great for casual date nights or just hanging out with friends or family. Tables are spaced rather far apart giving all plenty of privacy."

They also have amazing appetizers! When I'm working I'll usually order a couple appetizers and make it a meal! Their Spicy Tuna Kimbap, Spicy Chili Dumplings, Cream Cheese Wontons, and Fried Carpaccio are only a few of my favorites!! Ohhh and don't let me forget the broccoli and cheese fondue!! Yes Please!

You would have to order a ridiculous amount to get full off of their portions. On top of that, they charge $2 for a small bowl of white rice. Their banchan was good and we were given a good amount. The waiter that we had were not very friendly. I couldn't get him to refill my Coke until the end of the meal. Over all this is not a place I would go back to again with a large group of people. I may revisit if it's me and another petite person who doesn't eat much. Don't go here if you want more bangs for your buck."

We ordered the cream cheese wonton, fried calamari, (2) beef toro and (2) bulgogi. They also gave us the ban chan (side dishes) when you order a minimum of 2 BBQ dishes. The rice bowl portions are pretty hug so depending on how much meat you get I think one bowl can fit between you and another person. I love how it definitely fills up 2 people with less of a price than all you can eat KBBQ joints here in Vegas (Tofu Hut, Korean Garden BBQ). Overall great experience, will be coming back again soon!"

The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was really nice. The musical selection was also on point. It's great a thing I work right across the street cause I'll definitely be here more often."

We ordered bulgogi, spicy pork, spicy chicken, Kalbi, and pork belly. All the meat came out perfectly marinaded and so tender! The only thing was the pork belly, it came plain with no marinade. I would definitely order round 2 if I had the stomach to. \nWe also ordered the spicy tofu soup, which was also equally delicious. The tofu is very soft, which is the way I like mine. \n\nThe pricing here is definitely affordable as well. They have a happy hour menu from 10pm-1am. Appetizers and BBQ will be either $3 or $4. And they have half off drinks! \n\nI definitely left here feeling full and satisfied. If I lived in Vegas, I would definitely come here for Korean BBQ."

            "review": "Let me start by saying that I don't like Korean barbecue. In fact, I don't like Korean food, other than the occasional tofu house--and by occasional, I mean once a year. But this place swept me off my feet. \n\nWe, a party of six, arrived before the restaurant opened at 11:30 a.m. and waited outside for the doors to open. As we stepped in, someone started to set our table with all the side dishes; as soon as we were seated, we started nibbling. These were high-quality side dishes, from the fishcake slices to the kimchi. There was also macaroni salad, pickled cucumbers, etc. All of these items are \"refillable\" upon request.\n\nWhile the menu includes weekday lunch specials and meal sets (four different options for parties of 2 or 6), we opted to order a la carte so we could get each item we wanted:\n-Kobe beef carpaccio ($9.95): So good! Thin slices of meat heaven, really. There was enough for each of us to have 2-3 pieces, too, so definitely a generous serving.\n-Spicy tuna kimbap ($6.95): Kind of like a spicy tuna with crispy rice roll that you'd find at some Izakayas, but the rice is rolled up in seaweed, and the tuna is poke-style. You get the soft fish and the crunchy rice with a light sriracha mayo flavor--comes together very nicely. It's four rolls, but we managed to share between six of us. \n-Tteokbokki ($4.95): Consisting of soft rice cake, fishcake (same as the side dish), and hot sauce, this dish took me by surprise. It looks like a simple bowl of rice cakes, but is full of flavor, not awfully spicy. Make sure that you get a fishcake slice with the rice roll to get all the flavors together. A good, cheaper option for something that's a bit more filling.\n-Spicy ramen egg ($6.95): I was skeptical, but boy was I proved wrong! This was one of the most enjoyable bowls of ramen I've had, even though it really was just ramen, egg, some greens, and spice. Like the tteokbokki, it's simple, but so good for the soul and for the tummy. You can opt for the Japanese sausage/ seafood options for additional cost.\n-Bibim nangmyun ($11.95): Spicy cold thin noodles. This was my least preferred of all the dishes, but even then, I'd give it a 4/5. Nothing bad about it, just that it's not as savory as it looks, though you can add whatever sauces you want. I'd recommend mixing in some of the spicy fishcake side dish for additional flavor. \n-Original bibimbap ($12.95): Our server helped us mix everything together and even dished it out to each of us. Best bibimbap I've had, hands down. Flavorful, filling, and \"healthy\" (because of all the veggies in it, of course).\n-Beef toro ( 2x$4.95), beef tongue (2x$8.95), flat iron garlic ($8.95), Korean prime kalbi ($8.95): I couldn't really tell the difference between any of them, but it doesn't matter, because they were all so delicious. For the meats that aren't already marinated, definitely use the three sauces provided to you--in fact, I recommend dipping the same piece of meat into all three sauces to get a slightly sweet/ tangy, and definitely spicy kick to your otherwise unflavored meat. \n\nAll of this cost only $125--including tax and gratuity! All six of us were extremely stuffed and very happy. Oh, AND with Yelp check-in, we each got a free macaron for dessert... Maybe not the best life choice, but who can turn down a free dessert?"

I order the mushroom and asparagus but they are all ready to eat and they are cooked directly over fire. I would like to cook them by myself. Still it is a very nice place to visit. If you are not seeking for high-end dining experience on Strip yet still want some place better than Panda Express with reasonable price, this is the place you should visit."

Gangnam isn't all you can eat, but you are still getting your money worth.\n\nAtmosphere is that of a high end restaurant. Dimly lit, fancy decorations, expensive looking grills, professional looking servers, & popularly hip music. What caught my attention the most was a projector showing music videos of not only well known recent English music, but they also have popular Korean groups also. I find myself dancing & singing along.\n\nThe servers are very helpful in recommending what to order. They're able to describe each dish or drink well enough to make a decision. They also give honest opinions on whether one thing is better than another thing.\n\nThe meats were served looking really fresh & presented really well on a plate. Of all the Korean barbecue places not one where I've seen the meat served already seasoned.\n\nNot many Korean barbecue places I know have a Happy Hour or lunch special. This place has pretty good deals on their appetizers & meat. For the money you spend at all you can eat places, you'll have a better experience here compared to any other Korean barbecue place in Vegas. Drinks, meats, food, desserts - you can definitely taste the difference in quality & you can even make others jealous with a picture of a nice presentation too!"

All kinds of yummy goodness. Seriously. One order has two wraps so order accordingly. \nThe meat is such good quality. Trimmed and perfectly marbled. You can choose marinated or natural. I recommend natural since the quality of meat was excellent it doesn't need much. This is how you know the place is good when you grill the meat simply and dip it in a bit of sesame oil, salt and pepper. \nThis is now my new must go to place when I come to Vegas.

We said yes and all of the sides and food were being handed to us at the speed of light. The only thing they didn't do is feed us so that we could get out sooner. I appreciate fast and efficient service!\n\nI loved their spicy chicken and regular chicken!! The chicken was delicious and perfectly cooked. My friends worked on eating the beef. The restaurant gave us freshly made miso which was light and refreshing. I am so used to eating the crappy instant miso. This use of real miso paste was a welcome touch. Their sides are good, but nothing to write home about.\n\nThe amount of food and decent quality definitely justified the $45 cost."

Spicy tuna kimbap was booomb, though, get it."

Spicy soft tofu soup\n7. Side of white rice \n\nTotal bill came out to $78.52 for 2 of us before tax  so $90ish after 15% tip. \n\nI would say the food was 3/4 Korean and 1/4 Japanese style bbq. Korean sides are free and unlimited and if u \"volunteer\" writing a yelp review u get a free dessert  not the reason I am writing one but hey free is free...\n\nOverall value & price I would say 4.5 out of 5 but with the good customer service it bumps to a 5! Would come back here next time I'm in town! :)\n\n\n2 days later:\n\nI love the uni bibimbap so much I had to come back here again & get it to go for the road home lol. I had some left over from the 1st time here and  it was still delicious cold. The service person on the phone was pleasant  and helpful. He recommended the bulgolgi bibimbop for the hubby! Will keep u posted on how the food tastes in the car\n\nSo here we are in Vegas again May 2016 :)\n\nWe're about to drive back home but had to stop for my favorite uni bibimbap!! This dish is served in a stone hot pot so the rice has a nice toasty taste with good amount of uni. \n\nThe quality of meat is pretty good for AYCE place but we usually order a la carte so we don't overeat before we get on the road lol. \n\nWe refer all our families and friends who are in town visiting to eat here! ;)\n\nTil next time..."

Despite being envious of the sights and smells that came afterwards, I was happy with my order of veggie ramen and bimbimbap.\n\nWhen the ramen first came, the noodles looked like they came from an instant ramen package. When I taste the salty sour broth though, I was happy and let the noodles continue soaking the broth and focus on my Sapporo. Once the noodles were completely hydrated, it was delicious.\n\nSo was my bimbimbap. I didn't notice any tofu and it didn't have an egg either but still flavourful without any obvious protein. Not only was my meal filling. It was cheap. My large ramen noodle bowl was about 6 dollars while my rice bowl was 8. I can't say no to large cheap portions of tasty food."

Just the way it is served and the intricacy of the cuts pertaining to the grain of the meat.  Also the Japanese fusion appetizers are good as well.

If we ordered them al carte, then it probably would've been even cheaper but we were really lazy and hungry. \n\nThe service was attentive. 5/5\n\nThe reason why I'm deducting a star is because the seats is far from the table making it uncomfortable while eating. Also it's super hot! Been to maybe Korean bbq spots were it was cool and refreshing to eat. Also maybe the music.

One was like a pretty ponzu, one was like a teriyaki, and another a spicy teriyaki. \n\nWe tried the premium prime Kalbi and it was really tender.  We had to order another plate so we could each get another bite. \n\nThe waiters are friendly and always around to take orders. \n\nAnd best of all, for being a great yelper and doing a review, we got a free macaron."

We loved the side dishes, especially the squid. Right behind our booth, someone else was celebrating their birthday and the staff sang a  birthday song and gave him/her a complimentary dessert.  So we had to tell them it was my sister-in-law's birthday also.  Our waiter assured us she would get a dessert too.  On the corner of our booth, I was excited to see that they give a free dessert if you rate them on Yelp  at the time of the visit.  It was a limited time offer so I wanted to take advantage of that. I showed the pictures to my 4 year old nephew and as soon as he saw the colorful macaron ice cream, which he called \"ice cream burger\", he asked for it right away.  I had to coax him to finish his food first  before we  get him the free ice cream.  He agreed and waited so patiently for it.  While everyone's eating, I downloaded the Yelp app so I could rate the restaurant and get the macaron ice cream for my nephew.  I followed the instructions and gave them a really good rating based on the food itself which was a 5 star for everyone.  I got up to use the restroom and asked my husband to show the review to them (as required). However, when I returned, my sister-in-law's complimentary dessert  was already there.   They didn't sing her a song either. It, unfortunately,  wasn't what my nephew had been waiting for. Our server told us that they would only honor one.  I'm not upset about not getting the free dessert cause we could have bought him one right there instead.  For one, it was already late. I just  didn't want to see my nephew disappointed.  We'll just buy him one in the morning from somewhere else."

We looked on Yelp and GangNam came highly rated and was open late.\n\nThere wasn't any wait and we were seated immediately.  The server as nice and friendly.  We order the GangNam #1 for 2.  The small sides were good.  I enjoyed the pickled cucumbers and the daikon.  We had 5 meats.  All of them were good.  The Bulgogi was a little too salty, but still decent.  The only downside was that they didn't change our grill.\n\nOverall though, considering the cost, the quality of meat, and the amount of food you get, this is a solid recommendation if you are looking for korean bbq in Vegas."

We ordered 4 happy hour menus, Fried calamari ($4), Chicken Karage($4), Spicy Chicken BBQ with Lemon Source($3), Korean Chicken BBQ Cheese Fondue($3) and Filet Mignon ($8.5) and Sukiyaki, all delicious! Every menu was much bigger portion than we expected, plus endless refillable free 8 side dishes come with meal!  We were sooooo stuffed.  They give you 3 kinds of dipping sauce for the meat besides lemon sauce and cheese we ordered, all tasted excellent. Beer was a half price during happy hour. For all the above tasty meal plus beer, the total was only $37 including tax. Unbelievable!!!

She was frantic to find a place that served Asian food, was affordable, but great enough for the dozen of us to enjoy--in  a couple of short hours from her call!  Of course, I turned to Yelpers and the fact that Gangnam had over 2,500 reviews with an average rating of 4.5 stars convinced me this was a safe place to recommend. My friend immediately booked their private room for 7pm.\n\nWhile the restaurant appeared small from the storefront, it was surprisingly well laid out for groups, couples, and we saw singles dining, too. So don't hesitate to stop in if you're dining solo.  We were seated in a private room toward the back, large enough, yet cozy for 12.\n\nAs soon as most of the group were seated, the ban chan was brought in. Large variety of appetizer were laid out, including the requisite kimchi mixes, sprouts, taegu, and more. Our friendly server guided us to the combination selections.  It was unanimous that the Gangnam combo would be the way to go as the more people you have, the better the price per person. The ban chan had the requisite various kimchi, sprouts, and much more.\n\nOnion miso soup, large salad to share, fresh oysters on the  half shell, grilled shishito peppers, mushroom medley, choice of steamed rice or bulgogi bibimbap rice, and beef ... lots and lots of beef ... kalbi, bulgogi,  etc. Food seemed to just keep coming until we were overwhelmed and finally tapped out!\n\nWe enjoyed the experience and the food so much, we're planning on heading back with another group of family coming to town in a few weeks."

I'm glad they didn't have the AYCE option. \n\nFor the price, which is quite reasonable, the portions are a good size. We had three meat plates (beef toro, pork belly, prime kalbi) and a few sides (oysters, dumplings, calamari, seaweed salad) , shared between three people. I was stuffed! We also ended up getting banana tempura for dessert. All in all, it was a good meal. My least favorite item probably wouldve been the calamari. But there are so many other items to order, it's not a big deal. It wasn't bad, I just have a high expectation for my calamari. \n\nAs far as service, they were on top of their stuff. Never had to ask for water. They checked on us just enough to not be annoying. \n\nWe went around 530, and we were the only people there, which worried me a bit. But by the time we left, about hour and a half later, the place was packed. So if you don't want to wait, be sure to go early. \n\nAll in all, I definitely will be back."

Also, I mistakenly ordered the regular prime kalbi instead of the Korean kalbi (korean has the sawce) and they swapped it for the Korean one! Only con is the serving size.

We ordered the Prime Kalbi, Korean Prime Kalbi (marinated), Beef Toro (brisket), Flat Iron Garlic steak, Bulgogi, bacon wrapped Enoki mushrooms and Jap Chae.\n\nThe meats were fresh and tender.  Brisket had very little fat for a change.\n\nThe Jap Chae glass noodles with beef is BIG and delicious.  Good value."

The restaurant was freezing cold, the service was awful, the food wasn't very good, and to top it off the server gave us some other person's credit card and ran away before we could tell her it wasn't ours! In no way is that ok. I will never go back to this restaurant again. \n\nWhen we got there we were greeted with the most unfriendliest server I have ever seen. She made us feel very unwelcome and as if we did something wrong by coming into the restaurant. \n\nAfter we were seated we were ignored for a bit. She never asked us if we had been there before or explained anything to us. After we ordered she gave us some kind of sauce and some side dishes. There was no explanation as to what any of it was. We tried 5 of the 7 side dishes and only one of them tasted like anything and that was cucumber. They were not good and the 2 we didn't try looked really unappetizing. \n\nWhen the meat came out again no explanation about how to handle and cook the raw meat so that there is no cross contamination or cooking times to make sure the meat is cooked properly so that we don get food poisoning. Ever other restaurant that has you cook your own meat that I have been to tells you these things. The meat was alright. It was nothing special. For the amount of stars and reviews this restaurant has I expected something better than mediocre.  \n\nWhen we were finished we had to wait at least 15 minutes to get the check. We noticed that the server kept looking at us but was trying to ignore us. The table next to us who sat down while we were eating got their check before we did. We finally got the check and gave them our card. The sever then brought back the card and basically threw it on the corner of the table and ran away. She had actually  given us the wrong credit card. She ran away so fast we couldn't give it back. Luckily a tall skinny male server came an took it and brought our card."

This parking lot was the same parking lot I was at a few trips ago when visiting Azusa Hookah Las Vegas and left my extra set of car keys. So I was destined to get in touch with my Korean roots. It is a perfectly sized place about 14 BBQ tables. I sat at the bar. I ordered the kimchi jigae. Soups are priced about $9.95 comes out in one of the Stone hot boiling pots. Before that came out you also get lucky  #7 banchans and the kimchi was perfectly fermented, stir fried fish cakes, cucumber kimchi, ojingeo muchim, spicy beans sprouts, pickled radish w/jalape\u00f1os and the famous pasta salad (or potato salad at other Korean places). I am one happy salty half Asian clam. My body is in sodium hell.... But that is the perils of Korean eats... But that kimchi jigae broth with the pork was making live to every taste bud in my mouth.

Lots of people there to serve you. Food is served to you raw and you cook on a gas grill in your table. They different items you can choose from Al la carte or as a group special. The specials are for parties of 2 or 4, we had a party of 3 and ordered the Premium and that was plenty of food for us. defiantly worth try."

Now on to my actual review. Place is decorated nicely and makes for a great atmosphere. Husband and I decided on the Gagnam Special for Two. We were originally looking for an all you can eat Korean BBQ restaurant; however all the sheer amount of reviews for this place caught our attention and it happens to be a few doors down from one of our favorite sneaker boutiques. The food was good, high quality of meat with pretty good sides (kimchi being my favorite) and you get a LOT of it for what you pay for. I'm taking away a star for service. Our server was quick to drop off our bill when we weren't even halfway through the meal (we hadn't asked for it yet) but not quick to check on us..didn't do so once the entire time. Felt incredibly rushed as it was starting to become busy and you could tell they just wanted as many people in and out as fast as possible. I would come back during a less busy time. Left so much food on the table."

I didn't eat any rice and was completely full by the end of the meal. Also for reference I eat A LOT. The service was also very satisfactory with them changing out our bbq plate every few minutes and also serving us as quickly as possible. We also ordered a (Kimchi soup) which was more than tasty. The order included filet mignon, bulgogi, samgyupsal and other types of meat. It also came with dumplings Miso soup and salad. All of them were nice. The side dishes or  were honestly very mediocre except for the Kimchi however it was fine seeing as the main part of the meal was so delicious.\n\nI really enjoyed the meal and I will definitely be back for more!!! \n\nPEACE!!"

Now keep in mind they do not have AYCE, which is good because you don't have meat just lying out until it is all gone; quality control is what I would say about their meat!\n\nNow for beginners or people who never been to a Asian BBQ style restaurant like this, I would suggest ordering al la carte first.  I know they offer combo meal but it's a lot of food and you may be gambling with what you \"may\" like or not like.  You can always order as you cook.  Service is excellent and they check up on you in timely manners.  That was a big plus for me...we all know that server at that restaurant where the server just keeps coming back and interrupting...well that is not the case here.  \n\nAs for location, it is situated in a shopping center that offers multiple eatery places, sushi, mexican, etc.  The only thing I would be caution on is that it is located across the street from Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  I can only imagine just how busy they may be during the weekend.  If you don't want to wait or be in a crowded situation, I would suggest going during the week days.  \n\nThe thought of them now while writing this review makes my mouth water again!  Hahaha!"

Filet Mignon was a little tough prob. because of how its grilled. Lettuce salad wasn't that great, but I did enjoy the seaweed salad. And the dessert which was a ice cream macroon (mango flavored) was delicious--reminded me of the one's at Trader Joes which I do like.

We called ahead to try to make a reservation, and were told that they don't take same day reservations but they weren't busy at the time so we came in anyways. \n\nWe ordered beef toro, bulgogi, pork belly, and mushroom medley. We also had the chicken wings, fried calamari, and jalape\u00f1o poppers for apps. Each dish was $4 with the exception of the mushrooms ($2). The meats were really good quality, and my favorite was the bulgogi which was really tender and had a great marinade. The chicken wings were average, crispy but pretty bland. The poppers were filled with cream cheese and salmon with a tempura batter. The calamari were okay as well, but the breading was disappointingly flavorless, much like the chicken wings. The dipping sauce that came with it added some much needed flavor to the dish.\n\nThe service was relatively spotty. We were seated immediately and our waiter took our order quickly. Afterwards however it was kind of difficult to get anyone's attention as the restaurant became more busy, so we had to flag down someone each time we needed something. Our appetizers also came out way after the meats, so we were pretty much done with our food by the time our last appetizer came out.\n\nAlso keep in mind rice is not included when you order dishes a la cartel for happy hour. It's $2 for a bowl and 1 bowl is enough for 2 to share.\n\nI must admit though that I think the reviews for this place are somewhat inflated because they give you a free desert if you write and show them a posted Yelp review. To avoid the inevitable awkwardness associated with showing your server an low or average review and the fact that you are getting a free desert, I feel like people naturally give this place a higher review than they normally would. Definitely wouldn't expect this place to be averaging 4.5 stars.\n\nOverall Gangnam Asian BBQ is a solid restaurant for your Asian BBQ fix while in Vegas."

The waiters were very attentive, filling out water often and checking on us and the grill. This place is family friendly but could be great for a date night because of the quite low key environment. Food came out quickly and tasted great! Check this great place out next time you're in Las Vegas."

            "review": "I happen to be in vegas for a very large convention, and part of the enjoyment in my job is traveling city to city and trying the different restaurants available near my hotel.  After a very long day of setting up a new show I was starving!\n\nI head back to my hotel at the Las Vegas Westgate, and first things first, I really needed to get out of my work clothes shower and just chill for a minute.  My co worker and myself ar both sitting in our hotel room, catching the end of the sunday night football game, smoking marijuana, and discussing what we want to eat.  We decide we are both craving asian (both food and women) and come accross Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining as a close and affordable option not too far from our hotel.  My co- worker and I are still just smoking weed and now were wrapped up in the NFL game (the giants were playing the niners and I have Carlos Hyde on my fantasy team and he got a late TD to make my lead pretty solid heading into MNF) and now its getting late.  We check the hours and are both pleased to see that Gangnam is open untill 1 am, and to top it off they have a late night happy hour starting at 10 pm.  \"This is perfect!\" Chris, My co-worker, says.  He continues, \"We have time to smoke more pot, sit down and just be high for 5 minutes then realize we have to get going.\"\n\nI thought to myself, \"yes this is perfect by the time we get there the munchies should be fully kicking in, and I will have a nice hearty appetite for my meal.\"\n\nChris and I show up, looking fresh in our Hawaiian shirts ready to eat.  Our waitress sits us down and immediately recognizes our sweet shirts and asks us if we are from Hawaii.  We tell her \"no\" although chris is a quarter Hawaiian but we explain to her we are from California and are just visiting for the week.  She then explains to us that she is hawaiian and she just returned from visitng just a couple days prior. Anyways, conversation ensued, our waitress (she was like a solid 7) points out to us some of here favorite things on the menu.  I procede to order appetizers of their Calimari and the spicy tuna Kimbap.  Remember we are now incredibly stoned and I think this would of tasted great sober.  This tuna kimbap appetizer was absolutely fantastic, I highly reccomend!\n\nSo now we move on to the entrees.  I order the bacon wrapped scollaps, the Korean Chicken Fondue, and the Prime Kalbi.  My co-worker had also order the the Korean chicken and the kalbi, but his for his third dish he ordered the Harami Miso. Now I loved all tree things I ordered.  I enjoyed the mix i made myself with one beef dish, 1 chicken dish, and 1 seafood dish.  The chicken cheese fondue stood out as my favorite, while chris pointed to the Harami Miso as his favorite.  My only somewhat negative comment would be that the Prime Kalbi cuts I recieved seem to be a little to fatty for my liking making the meat really chewy. We washed our meals down with a pitcher of kirin.\n\nNow after we finished with our meat cuts, it was time to move on to dessert.  I got the cofee flavored Ice cream sandwhich thing, and it was very tasty and was a nice cold snack to end the meal on.  \n\nAfter dinner chris and I went back to our room to smoke more marijuana and stream Archer on netflix.\n\nTL;DR: Got way too high off gravity bong rips in my hotel. Headed to gangnam and ate a lot of korean bbq. Got a free dessert for writing a review on yelp."

I like to roll my meat in either rice paper or radish or both and clear my pallets with the condiments. This place, although the service was good, the food taste was not bad, but the lack of the essential Korean food restaurant experience was a turn down. For example, they don't have rice paper, radish, seaweed etc. Some of you might say that is not for you, understandable but it should be an option for some people. Anyway, if you like a relaxing experience and not picky about the food experience so much, this place maybe for you.."

The environment is really clean and the servers are really friendly and informative! They made sure that we know how the menu works. They also offer some Japanese dishes!

Sura was fine, but not good/great.\n\nI had flown into Vegas, and per a mutual agreement, had not made any special Valentine's Day plans.  We ended up here for dinner, and there were probably 3 or 4 open tables.  We were quickly seated in the modern looking space.\n\nThe menu was interesting - they had the standard combo items, where you get a mix of meat and sides, but apparently when we were there it was happy hour, and they had items that were priced in the $3 to $8 so that you'd order a serving of beef toro, spicy pork, sides, etc  - almost felt like a tapas place, though obviously meat heavy.\n\nQuality of the meat seemed a little better than Sura.  We were a little surprised that the kalbi/short-ribs had the bones removed, but that was fine.  All the meat and sides we had were good, and the gas grill worked fine.  I was also glad to see that they had spicy cucumber as a side, which is one of my favorite forms of kimchi.\n\nThe small plate style of ordering probably kept us from over-eating as much as an AYCE joint, but I was feeling nearly as full.\n\nThe one miss we had was that we had ordered white rice, but it didn't come out till we were almost done (which had included a second round of ordering).  I had asked about it earlier to one of the staff, and they nodded, and wandered away like they were on it, but didn't bring out any rice.  My guess is that they had gotten slammed at some point, and ran out of rice, so they had to make more, but that's only a guess.  No one said anything, and when they did bring out the rice near the end of the meal.\n\nOverall, our damage with tip was an even $50, which was considerably less than the $72 we had spent at Sura, and I left feeling more satisfied with my meal."

I had never seen the bbq trays on the table before. \nFortunately, my co-worker knew what to order, and she made some recommendations that were just fantastic. I had bulgogi (pork) with a mushroom medley that was absolutely delicious. The portions were very generous, too. It was fun cooking the food on the little bbqs.\nService was a bit slow, but the poor waitress was having problems with their cash register; she apologized and explained what the issue was, so we were forgiving of the situation.\nThe lunch special was very reasonable, considering the amount of food we received and the quality of it. We were extremely happy campers when we left and went back to the conference. I told myself that next time I go to Vegas, I will *definitely* be back to eat here.\n\nBUT.... the REAL gem of this experience occurred two weeks later, when I got back to work and submitted my receipts. I had misplaced the credit card receipt (still had the itemized one) and my work was on my back bugging me for the credit card receipt. I contacted the restaurant with my pathetic request and the gentleman who answered the phone was very understanding, and sent me a reprint that satisfied the dragons in Accounting. So... GREAT food, outstanding portions, good value for the money - and EXCEPTIONAL customer service. Gangnam, I hope you open a restaurant in Ventura, California someday!! I will definitely be back to visit!!"

I love trying restaurants off the strip in Vegas, as they are SO much better quality and pricing than anything near the touristy parts. \n\nGangnam was so much more appetizing than anything we could have hoped for on a post-EDC weekend  ;D\n\nLocated in the corner of a mini-mall, if you love legit, delicious, fine Asian dining, you MUST come here!"

Ordered cream cheese wonton, mushroom medly, jalape\u00f1o poppers, calamari, pork belly, beef toro, spicy pork and Korean chicken cheese fondue.\n\nCream cheese wonton: All it was is wonton wrapper with literally only cream cheese inside, fried and served with sweet sauce. Pretty bland and disappointing. 1/5\n\nMushroom medly: Just different types of mushrooms that was mixed with melted butter. 2/5\n\nJalape\u00f1o poppers: Pop of deliciousness! Jalape\u00f1o sliced in half stuffed with cream cheese and crab and deep friend drizzle with sweet dressing. 5/5\n\nCalamari: Crispy calamari with the spicy mayo dip sauce, average. 3/5\n\nPork belly: So good, you can never go wrong with pork belly. Slapped this on the grill and once crispy on both sides... With rice it's amazing. 5/5\n\nBeef toro: Basically brisket... My friend enjoyed this very much. 4/5\n\nSpicy pork: Meh 2/5\n\nChicken cheese fondue: Grilled the chicken and cheese however once dipped into cheese it was way chunky and not good. Aye the chicken alone. 1/5\n\nOverall the food was ok, but I prefer Korean BBQ at tofu hut. The dipping sauces don't really stand out to me, one was sweet and one  is spicy... But I still love my sesame dipping sauce at tofu hut. The quality of meat is better but as far as the taste, tofu hut is way better. I didn't know during happy hour they don't give you rice? I had to ask for rice for both of us, but my server only came back with one bowl of rice... So we split the rice. \n\nOverall, this place is good... My first time trying Japanese BBQ."

After being promptly seated and minor hemming and hawing over the menu, we decided to order the meat lover's combo for 2, a hot sake, and beer for sake bombs to start our weekend. Between 3 people, we opted for the combo for 2 because we figured we could always order more and didn't want to get too gluttonous by ordering the combo for 4. \n\nFirst came the booze, then the side dishes, then all of the meat. The grill heats up very quickly, however it is only hot in the middle and burns the meat rather quickly. Also, don't bother with the onions and assorted sliced veggies; they will burn too. Those aside, my favorite was the spicy pork. Everything else was decent, but not standout. The side dishes are standard and decent too, but the waiters did not come to refill them until we flagged them down.\n\nTheir sound system is not very good. They alternated between old school hip hop/R&B and Kpop, which are both my jam but the low sound quality actually irked me a bit. \n\nGiven the many options for dining in Vegas, I likely wouldn't come back here unless I had a huge hankering for kbbq when in town."

I had no idea what to expect and trusted yelp (like I do most of the time).  I called and made a reservation for 13 on a Saturday night.  The dinner turned out great and I would definitely return. For Vegas standards, this is a good KBBQ place.\nRestaurant/Ambiance:  Its located right off the strip (convenient) but towards the back of the lot.  Kinda hard to see.  Restaurant is not a hole-in-the-wall type of place.  Kind of dark with all tables having a BBQ grill top.  We were fortunate enough to be given the private room in the back.  I think it can comfortably seat 15 or so with 2 grills.  It worked out well since we had a couple of small kids.  My only knock was that the table height was kinda high for the chairs.  They had tons of pillows to supplement, but made it just a tad awkward.  The place was initially empty around 5:30pm, but quickly filled up and there was a wait by the time we left around 7pm.  \nService:  Service was ok.  Not up to LA standards but decent.  I thought we would get a dedicated server for our group, but through the evening, the servers would rotate to help us out.  Grills were switched out when asked.  Here they do not cater to you and cook your meat for you (like most of the LA BBQ places).  Food came out quite rapidly.  They didn't clear out our plates, but we had a table on the side that we just set all of the empty dishes.  The banchan was never refilled (we never asked).  Water was refilled when requested.  They had a really nice birthday comp (4-5 ice cream macaroons with candle).  All in all, service was decent.\nFood:  In a large group, you have to go with the preset menu.  We opted for the Gangnam BBQ package for 6 (next to highest package).  This came with a lot of appetizers and side dishes and 5 cuts of meat.  The appetizers included: oysters (good size ones and pretty fresh in quality), shishito peppers (really good per one of the guests), fried calamari (crunchy and meaty.  Nice spicy mayo dipping sauce too), miso soup, salad, and bulgogi bibimpap.  I really liked the bulgogi pap.  Basically meat and rice.  The cuts of meat included: bulgogi, kalbi, unmarinated steak, marinated/unmarinated prime steak.  I wished they would have included chadol as one of the selections.  YOu couldn't really substitute anything.  The meat quality was pretty good.  Good amount.  They also included 3 different dipping sauces. \nValue:  If it wasn't for the combo package, I think it could have gotten a tad pricey.  You have to pay for the banchan.  I requested sahm and sahm jang, and they charged me for that.  We did the 6 person combo with 10 adults.  But we ordered a lot of other things on top (udon, 2 different soups, and more rice).\n\nAll in all, a great korean BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas.  I would def make reservations ahead of time."

Our favorite dish was the bi bim bop which was large and served in a good sized round pan instead of a bowl shape so there was a lot of surface area for the rice to get crispy against the iron pan, just how we like it . The bbq at table has good ventilation.  We walked in without reservation and were seated promptly . We enjoyed our dinner here. Even got free dessert with Yelp review... Bonus."

This place far exceeded our expectations! We ordered 8 different meats for the 4 of us, 2 appetizers, and some soup and it was just the right amount of food for us. Each person gets their own set of tongs as well so one person doesn't get stuck cooking the whole time. Also, it's cheaper than most of the places we've been in Arizona and California which is a plus."

This Korean BBQ restaurant is on Paradise Road just behind the northern strip hotels.  \n\nAlthough the strip mall it is located in seemed busy, the restaurant itself was pretty vacant for a Sunday night at 6:30PM.  \n\nThey gave us a menu with \"happy hour\" pricing on most of the food packages, which I'm not sure if that is given at all times or not.\n\nAnyway, 4 stars.  The decor is really nice, the service is very attentive, the food was great.  They bring all the food to you. The Miso Soup was delicious. The meats were brought to our table, and they ask if you want assistance in cooking them at your table; however, we declined and cooked them ourselves.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  \n\nMinus one star for one reason only.  I thought the prices were a bit high with the \"happy hour\" pricing.  If the prices are truly higher during peak hours, I would definitely not come back.  At the \"happy hour\" prices, I would consider a return, although it is still a bit expensive for what it is."

            "review": "Everything about this place lived up to my expectations. My husband and I came for our wedding anniversary. I have been counting the days down until I can indulge into some gangnam style....pause. \n\nWe ordered pork belly, filet mignon, salmon wrapped in bacon, tempura kabocha, oysters, the spicy chicken wings, spicy garlic edamame, and the famous spicy tuna kimbap! First of all, spicy tuna kimbap is mmmmbop good! It's a roll of seaweed with rice in it fried into a tempura with spicy tuna atop. It was deeelish if you are a fan of raw fish, especially the spicy tuna flavor. It is a MUST GET when you come. You failed if you didn't order it to give it a shot. Don't expect the sizes of the meat to be on steroids. The meat are sliced so when you grill it yourself it doesn't take forever to cook. I think the portioning were perfect enough so you could indulge and enjoy whatever other items you ordered; therefore, you weren't meat overload. Unless, you came in with your carnivorous spirit on green.\n\nAll the side dishes (banchans) come free with the meal were delicious as well. I don't know if these side dishes are on a daily rotation, but we received 6 different servings of side dishes. These were bean sprouts, kimchi, kimchi like cucumber, Mac salad, radish (daikon) in a pool of some sweet sauce, and cuttlefish. The cuttlefish was so tender. It was my fave out of the banchans. I mean honestly, I don't think I was breathing as I was scarfing my food down. \n\nWe came in on a Tuesday evening. The ambiance was perfect. If you've been following my reviews you'd probably know by now that I come from a family of 6. I'm raising 4 boys and a husband. Lol. So this quiet time, is so much needed! It wasn't overly busy when we walked in. But as the night progressed so did the patrons. On a Tuesday night to have such business tells you something. The servers were great. Checked on us as often enough to not make me start secretly grumbling as a waiter approached. They were very good at clearing your table off of empty dishes so that was great as I dislike clutter. They did seem a little overly eager on certain parts such as the grill being used or not, but hey...I get it. Don't wanna char the grill or waste propane. That'd be equivalent to me telling my kids to turn the light off if no one is in the room. Except, we still had pieces on the grill that still needed grilling. My husband and I did give each other a look after awhile. But no biggy. \n\nI'd come back over and over until they give me reasons not to. The facility is clean. The colors are very zen like and I love that they have a projector screen of music videos playing. They played a mixture of rap and kpop. \n\nGood vibe, great food...you won't be disappointed. You do receive a free dessert if you post a yelp review then show to your waiter. So do it! It is a fun experience watching your husband \"cook\" for you for once! ;)"

Came with miso soup, sweet corn, oysters, shishito peppers, mushroom medley, bibimbaps, and a crap ton of meat!!! Everything was really tasty, definitely a good cure for a long weekend out in Vegas!\n\nService is also awesome :)!"

Our sides arrived quickly.  I noticed that we were the minority and the clientele was primarily Asian so I took that as a good sign.  \n\nHaving never had Korean BBQ before it would have been nice to get some instruction on what to do with everything. As an example, we cooked our meat on the sides instead of in the middle and it kept sticking to the grill. When there was just a little meat left on one plate, the server placed it on the grill for us and that's when we realized our placement error. \nAnother thing that might be helpful is some type of labeling on all of the different items so we would know what we were eating.  \nEverything we had was delicious.  I think the standout for me with regards to main dishes was the marinated pork.  All the appetizers were amazing.  The miso soup was so rich and flavorful.  The dressing on the salad was delicious and just the right amount of sweet.  The chili dumplings had a really tasty sauce and I thoroughly enjoyed the spicy garlic edamame.  \nWe discovered why they have so many reviews, too! Free dessert for posting a review.\nOverall, I really enjoyed my experience and would like to try it again, maybe someplace else to see if the experience is the same."

It is well-ventilated, dimly-lit and the dark and red tones are romantic.\n\nFOOD: my boyfriend and I ordered the Original Bibimbap $10 and the Korean Pancake with Thrifty's Vanilla Ice Cream $5-6. The Bibimbap was delicious and the stone pot was so hot it made the some of the rice crispy, cooked the vegetables and marinated beef well but kept the juices flowing and our stomachs satisfied! The Korean pancake was kind of small  but the ice cream was Thrifty's and that alone was a point.\n\nSERVICE: accommodating and quick! Served us quickly and efficiently.

The wait was a bit long but that's expected for any Korean spot that's this good. We had the Premium dinner set. I wanted to try their best cuts and you actually save some money by going with the preset meal rather then ordering them individually; trust me I did the calculations.  They also said that the portions were the same whether you order through the set meal for the individual dishes. I don't think any place has authentic Kobe beef in America but this place has the Kobe style beef which was really really good here. If you haven't tried that type of beef you should definitely try it once in your lifetime.  All four of the different meats that came with the meal were all really good so I would recommend you try the filet mignon first otherwise if you eat that last you will be disappointed. The tuna pokey was also really good and so was the beef carpaccio. The meal also came with different dipping sauces to go with the meat and all of them were very good. My wife also said that the salad was really good, I ate a little and I would agree. Even the asparagus came out really well, not overcooked. They put it in foil and cook it in butter and you can taste it. The side dishes are just OK. The bibimbap wasn't that great, the rice wasn't that crispy. All in all, one of the better Asian places in Las Vegas. Service was very good as should be expected in any Korean joint."

The portion sizes are good for two people and you get to sample several types of meats. The side dishes are not like your typical Korean BBQ which made me a bit disappointed. They serve the combos with rice, miso soup and a plain salad! I really missed my side dishes!!!! Grrr\n\n\nThe service is good and the price is reasonable. If you cannot get to china town, this is a good Korean BBQ for the area!"

Great customer service, someone is always near by to help you. Nice interior & K-pop music.\nIf you are thinking about bbq in Las Vegas - Gangnam is the best place all over the town."

First off the prices are a bit over inflated as is evident by the constant \"sale\" prices on the menu, everything is apparently half off and it still is not worth it.  We ordered a combination that allowed us to try just about everything they had on the menu.  The only items that I would have given more than two stars were the bulgogi and some fried chicken bites in a spicy sauce.  The scallops we ordered were not cooked properly (almost raw) and had a bit of funky fishy taste to them (in an old scallop way).  The service was very poor and quite slow.  When we brought the quality of the scallops to our server's attention, he commented \"well, that just how they are here.\"\nAs someone who enjoys good Korean BBQ, I had high hopes for this restaurant, but it simply failed to impress and for the money you would be much happier going somewhere else, like Honey Pig."

Empty cup on the edge of table. Servers walking past me over and over. I had to flagged one down to get a refill. Also we ask for extra rice and received it at the end. Everything seem rush. We ask for to go boxes and the server even forgot about that. \n\nWe never got refills on the complimentary side dishes like other koream bbq spots. Their side dishes were good tho. As well as the meats we ordered. But the service totally killed it. Never again I'll go to this spot\n\nOverhype. Overpriced. Just head down to other korean bbq in chinatown."

I want it every day if I could. \n\nI haven't try their bbq yet but the selection got me saying YOLO. Picture menu are the way to go with these type of join. ( check out their website )\n\nThe tofu soup with seafood is delicious and spicy, select your level wisely. All the side dishes that comes with your meal are some thing to look forward to as well, compare to the other korean bbq spots here in vegas. \n\nThese are just my opinion. Fellow yelpie, you guys have to come and experience it your self. \n\nThe service was good, attentive and fast. \nMy only issue is, the music playing in the back ground with some bad speakers. I love music, eating and watching music video, I enjoy that too. But please pump up the volume and replace those weak speakers for some JBL or Sony's \n\nThank you I'll be Back ."

We did a lot of talking during dinner and didn't pay attention if they served the right food. We found out after we left and this is not cool. Can we say they treat on their menu? The Kobe carpaccio didn't look as good as the picture. And their shrimp Bibimbap tasted horrible. \nService:\nI understand Sat is always awfully busy. So we ended up eating without drinks. Finally we got our drinks on the halfway of our dinner. BTW, they use very cheap wine to make Sangria. I can't taste the difference but my friend is a wine expert. :("

The servers were fast and helpful as well, despite only a few waitresses manning the entire restaurant. \n\nWe got the Gangnam set for 2 people ($70). Initially, we weren't sure if it would be enough meat for us but it definitely was. We couldn't even finish everything! The fried calamari was my favorite out of the appetizers. I love that they also included Bulgogi Bibimbap but I wished that they had the usual mixture of vegetables in the dish. The meat was very fresh, had great quality, and tasted amazing. I also got macaron ice cream sandwiches for dessert which was the perfect ending to a great feast! The set is a bit pricey but it's worth it!"

Came in a little early than lunch hour to avoid crowd on Thanksgiving day.\n\nFor BBQ we had harumi miso, prime korean kalbi, beef tongue, and pork belly. BBQ was great. Kalbi and miso beef were all juicy. Beef tongue was a little on the tougher side, but not sure whether it's them or we overcooked it :p \n\nWe also had the steamed egg and spicy tuna kimbap. Everything was amazing! The kimbap was really unique - not your ordinary kimbap - I enjoyed it SO MUCH!\n\nOverall I highly recommend this place if you happen to be around the area!"

We might have been better off choosing individual items but we wouldn't have gotten to try everything we did!  The miso soup was one of the best I've had, very flavorful.  The cream cheese wontons and edamame were good, as expected.  The 8 side dishes were a nice touch.  The shrimp were excellent, as was the korean chicken; the spicy chicken was too spicy for me so husband had that to himself.  Alternatively, I had the beef toro to myself; it was very fatty, in fact tasted like the fat on a grilled steak which I love but husband doesn't eat fat on purpose...(!) Get the bulgogi bibimbap instead of white rice; it's a more interesting rice dish with beef in it. Only had 1 piece of the broccoli cheese fondue, was just so much food something had to give!  The salad we didn't even touch until the end of the meal; we were pretty full but it had a nice light dressing that was a good ending."

Imo, everything was good, except the tofu soup. The meat cut was high quality, so tender and well seasoned. The appetizers are fried perfectly. Bibimbap was good, but at $12.99, i think I rather get another meat dish instead.

In terms of food, however, Gangnam is more Korean influenced, and the meat quality here is far better than Gyu's. They also provide banchan here, and the kimchi was really good! Kimchi Gangnam style!! \n\nMy buddy and I ordered pork off the lunch set menu (looked like pork shoulder), and it was really chewy for me at first (even though it was fully cooked). But I started to enjoy the texture the more and more I ate it. It was better than the actual pork belly in my opinion. The beef toro was pretty good, and its cuts were thick. \n\nWe also tried the chicken wings, steamed dumplings, and the spicy tuna kimbap. The chicken wings were tasty and flavorful. There was too much going on in the spicy tuna kimbap, and it was too sauce heavy. The steamed dumplings were just not very good, and even my buddy said that they tasted like packaged ones. \n\nNot sure if this place is worthy of their 4.5 star rating. I wasn't impressed by anything, but maybe I'll give it another shot if I'm in the area."

It's off of Paradise and Harmon, just across the way from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (in the same area as the CVS).  We had to call because we didn't see a sign  in the advertisement section, but it's there!  \n\nWhen we arrived it was happy hour.  Their happy hour beer was INSANE!  We paid $8.50 for a pitcher of beer!  $8.50!!!  Our server was so awesome!  Since this was our first time here she helped us figure out what we wanted on the menu AND also helped with putting the meat on the grill and letting us know when it was ready.  This was probably one of the most reasonably priced and filling meals we had in Vegas!  They're meal for two combos are huge!  Don't be afraid to ask for their help (cooking or picking something to eat), everyone is really nice!  The ambiance is really good too! When we were on our way out there was a bit of a line, so I definitely recommend calling ahead and making some sort of reservation.\n\nIf you're trying to walk to this place from the strip and it's well over 100 degrees, reconsider!

Even in Boston, they do not charge extra for 'ssam/ lettuce wrap' for the meats and for the salt/ sesame oil dip. This place charges an extra $2 for the lettuce, another $1 for the sesame oil sauce, and about $1.5 each for a bowl of rice. My husband dines like a true Korean, so he had to order those sides for a complete Korean BBQ meal. I found these surcharges to be very unappealing for a Korean restaurant and won't be coming back to this restaurant for this reason. It comes off as cheap and not allowing patrons to get the full Korean BBQ dining experience. \n\nQuality of the meat is good, but portions are ridiculously small. The samgyupsal (pork belly) pieces are sliced very thin and contains much more fat than meat (not in an appealing way that typical pork belly fat to meat ratio contains). \n\nDue to their current promotion of getting a free dessert for writing a review, I believe that the ratings here are highly skewed. The waitress reads your review on the spot then gives you a dessert. I highly doubt these reviewers here are writing an honest and thoughtful review of this place."

Do take into account that my palate has been spoiled from dining at all the kbbq spots in LA.\n\nI've had this place bookmarked for a long time now, but never actually got to going because of the mixed reviews I was getting. Four and a half stars on yelp and a visiting friend from New York finally got me to pay this spot a visit. We ordered the gangnam combo for a party of three which was more than enough food. This combo is meant to feed two people for $66. The combo came with five kinds of meats, fresh oysters, quartered sweet corn on the cob, bibimbap or side of white rice, miso soup, and mushroom medley. All cuts were subpar in my opinion. Bulgogi was too sweet and chunks were not cut up. The filet mignon was my least favorite. The chunks were rather large. Putting in work for something tasty was worthwhile, but for meats that did not taste at all fresh, that's just asking for too much. The bibimbap was simply sweet rice and beef. Not much veggies and hot sauce mixed in like the typical bibimbap dish. My favorite part of he meal was probably the soon tofu we ordered in addition to the gangnam combo. Soup was tasty and the seafood bits aroused surprise with each bite. This place also does not cook your meat for you. So roll up your sleeves, tie back you hair, and get cooking!\n\nWould I come again? Definitely not. Not worth the money. You might as well go elsewhere that will cook your meat for you for cheaper with better quality meat.\n\nFree dessert with yelp review post."

We called ahead and the person on the phone said there is lunch special available. When we came our waiter said no there isn't and said that person probably didn't know cause he was knew. I was a little annoyed but whatever. I ordered the tofu soup for 10 bucks which is a pretty reasonable deal. However when they brought it out... It was the smallest bowl of soup I've ever seen. I would call this a mug of tofu soup.. It's like the size of a side tofu soup they give you during korean bbq. So disappointed. Flavor wish it's fine."

This restaurant lags far behind other Korean BBQ joints in New York and Los Angeles particularly in terms of service, and while the food was solid it was by no means outstanding.\n\nFood:\nWe ordered the steamed egg which was way overcooked.  The BBQ dishes were decent however and the portions are all solid given the price.  The japchae was also on point.  \n\nService:\nNothing against the waiters as service was prompt, but the level of service was just not up to par for a Korean BBQ restaurant.  At the other restaurants I've been to servers cook the food for the customers, not to mention that beef and pork dishes are cooked on different specialized grill tops.  Once the meats are cooked the servers will slice them into bite-sized morsels.  Gangnam leaves the customers to do all of this on their own, and throughout dinner there was only one grill top which no one bothered to switch out even after the top was charred black.  The fan above the grill was also either off or not very strong so smoke was everywhere."

Not to say the quality isn't good, I just like my kbbq brisket to be thin, like 1/2-1/3 of the cut here. Fatty too, the meat here, to me, is pretty lean. Definitely not the type I was expecting. It's more like a slice of steak. I don't know if it's any fault of the food here, but I eat pretty fast and I was in and out in 30 minutes from sitting to exiting. My hotel is half a mile away, I almost didn't make it... Before I even exited the plaza I needed to number two baaaaaaaaad.  I'm so glad I was being lazy and drove l rather than walked. I would of liked to try the Kobe meat as the pictures other posted looks great, but after this close call I think I'll play it safe.  Oh and the cream cheese wontons, I liked!!!"

Clean, classy atmosphere.  The music is a mix of top 40 and big Kpop hits.  Service is prompt and courteous.  Nothing really noteworthy up to this point.\n\nThen the food arrives -- everything was well-seasoned and good quality.  The meat we ordered was never chewy, a welcome change from Tofu Hut.  Their prime kalbi was surprisingly marbled, definitely my top pick of the evening, followed by the green tea/mango cheesecake for dessert.\n\nIf you're looking for tapas-style Korean BBQ, Gangnam certainly makes the grade."

I think the meat was marinated a little too sweet (I am a meat lover btw). I really like the cream cheese wonton, but not the sauce that came with it. The restaurant was clean. It only have one restroom stall for each gender. I had a tall, Korean waiter and he was doing a great job even though he forgot to bring the macaroni salad I requested. It's okay though. I saw him running back and forth, so I didn't get upset. Overall, the food here was mediocre. I live in SoCal and I prefer the kbbq in or near my area because it an all-you-can-eat restaurant and/or buffet. The restaurant was clean. It only have one restroom stall for each gender.

I'm spoiled by the generous portions from the other KBBQ places I've been to. The vegetables included in the combo were random and awkward too. The combo does not come with your traditional banchan (Korean side dishes). No kimchi, no lettuce, none of the usual Korean sauces for your meat. We did get three sauces-ponzu, glazed sauce, and a somewhat spicy sauce. It wasn't terrible but without my banchan, there was something lacking for sure. Yes, I realize it's not a traditional KBBQ restaurant-some Korean/Japanese BBQ fusion. The service was good though. The restaurant is modern, clean, and trendy but that's not enough for me to come back."

I'm an out of towner from Dallas, Tx and we have our fair share of Korean barbecue places. But this place has a meat selection very different from the ones back home. They have Kobe meat (super soft and melts in your mouth), scallops, and even duck breast. The meat here is so much more succulent, flavorful, and different from the regular short ribs and brisket.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I got the premium meats and it was really worth it! It comes with appetizers like the tuna poke, oysters, miso soup, and beef carpaccio. The oysters were good but left a weird aftertaste. The beef carpaccio was a little on the sour side and the tuna poke was super fresh. This deal also comes with the  best cut meats in the restaurant. The table will be full of your regular Korean BBQ sides like kimchi, bean sprouts, and fish cake. When they bring the meats, it may seem like a small portion but it's actually really filling for 2 people. I really appreciate that their presentation of the meats are sliced and placed carefully on decorated plates as opposed to the meats back home are slapped onto a dingy plate and cut in front of you with scissors. \n\nThe only thing I don't like is that they don't give you advice on how to cook the meats like the Kobe beef. Service here is quick and polite. We were seated within 2 minutes and food came out in 10 minutes."

It was a graceless, ill-seasoned, flavorless mess. It was as if someone had decided to prepare a \"Korean meal\" at home, threw  \"Asian sauces\" on a few vegetables, made a salad, put chunks of cheap raw meat on a board, and served it up with a big hopeful smile.  \n\nI was able to eat the oysters, and there was some tofu thing that wasn't awful, but the rest of it was either offensively nondescript or downright repulsive. Has this place never heard of doenjang?\n\nThe surprise hard boiled egg hidden in the salad gave me sufficient energy to get back to my hotel. Otherwise, that was a rather expensive non-meal.\n\nTo be clear: this isn't Korean food. This is crudit\u00e9s and cheap raw meat. You could do it at home for $5."

Made me think of \"regular price 9.95 but just for you it's 7,50--- maybe because the food is old or no one wants to go there.\"\n\nI worried too much. The food was reasonably good. Tasty Korean BBQ at an affordable price. Service was pretty indifferent. \"Yes we have a smaller table but it isn't set up: why don't you sit at the bar.\"  And I had to wait for a fair amount of time before getting any attention to place my order. The indifferent service might account for my bulgogi being a bit on the cold side. But the food did taste good and was a good value for the money.\n\nI"

Vegetarians may feel a little bummed by a somewhat limited selection, and may not enjoy the cooking of the many meat selections right at the table. But it's a Korean barbecue, so wha'd'ya want?"

That's what I thought too.\n\nWhen we walked in, there were so many people waiting inside. So I thought this is a great sign. This place must be good. We waited over an hour and finally got seated. We ordered some short ribs and balgogi, soft tofu soup, and a clear noodle dish. \n\nAll the meat just taste like balgogi, pure sweet, has no kick at all. Soup was too salty. Calamari was blend, I don't understand why they mark it as \"must try\".  I have korean friends, and I visited bounch korean restaurants. Nothing were like this sweet. \n\nI am very disappointed, since I saw this place on yelp when I was at salt lake a week ago. \n\nThe only thing that's okay was their kimchi."

The interior is very clean, roomy, and low-lit (great place for a romantic meal). The tables are clean and it seems like they take real good care of the grills as well.\n\nI have never heard of this restaurant since they opened and oh my god... I am so glad now that I have! First of all, as a student, I think the location is great! It is literally across the street from UNLV. On my first visit here (also my first time in an asian bbq style restaurant), I was quite confused with their menu, but my server, a lovely Filipino young lady, was very helpful. She took her time explaining the different combos that they offered. I ended up getting the Meat Lover combo, which came out looking very fresh. What I loved most is that it came with miso soup, a salad, a bowl of sticky rice, and 3 different sauces for my meat. On my second visit, I had the same Filipino server. It was also during their happy hour, so select dishes were up to 50% off. I had the Meat Lover again (I can't help it--I love my meat!).\n\nIf you are into asian bbq and are near the area, I would highly recommend trying out Gangnam."

I ate like a king on a working man's budget IN VEGAS. Think about that for a second  Get here now and leave those other places alone. My recommendation: The Korean Bulgogi is thinly sliced, perfectly seasoned and you get to cook it YOURSELF for only $4. Can cook and burn water? No problem...your wait staff will help you out. \n\nThis definitely receives 10 BGLS (black girl lip smacks) for me"

My boyfriend and I had two cocktails, the meats & veggies mentioned above, two house salads, two miso soups, rice, and mochi ice cream, and the total came out to $80!!!! Can't beat it, and the experience was a lot of fun. We had to wait an hour on a Tuesday, but it's better than an empty restaurant as you know they're turning out a lot of food. It was definitely worth the wait, and you can put your name in and have a drink at the bar over at the Hard Rock to pass the time. Would absolutely recommend trying this place out, you won't be disappointed!"

And if anyone knows me, they know I have a sick addiction to edamame. Sick. This place didn't make that addiction any better whatsoever with their delicious garlic stuff, but it definitely hit the spot good. And that's just soybeans, I'm not even talking about the awesome meat! We chose the brisket, the filet mignon, the pork belly, just about anything and everything; all were delicious! All decently priced. They give you 3 different sauces to dip your protein in- there's like a ponzu tangy one, a house special one, and a spicier version of the house special- which I preferred- cause I loooove spicy. Only thing that was so-so for me was their steamed egg. It's one of my favorite things to eat when I go out to eat Korean BBQ and I was just a little disappointed considering everything else was so good. But if anything try some of their gyoza. Deeeeee freakin licious! Service was good and the room we got was pretty awesome. I'll be back for sure."
