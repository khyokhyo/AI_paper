            "review": "Besides getting a ticket to Paris, this French bakery is as close as you can get to the real thing.  The most amazing things about this place:\n\n1) Portions are huge and prices extremely reasonable.  Expect to pay less than $5 for a slice of their various desserts.\n2) It's baked by actual French chefs and from tasting their desserts, very likely trained in the classic French methods.\n3) Don't mean to stereotype, but are very friendly and patient, NOT expecting this at all, they are probably not from Paris.'\n\nTheir best desserts are the macaroons, my favorite being the blueberry flavor.  Their lemon tart is to die for.\n\nHighly recommended."

Delicious almond croissant (a must try), good flaky but not too buttery regular croissant and a baked just right baguette-- the crunchy crust plus soft, fresh inside reminded me of my visit to Paris two years ago. My wife and I had these items for breakfast at home. We can't wait to try them for lunch!"

            "review": "Saw all the great yelp reviews and wanted to try this bakery. I went on over and purchased an eclair, some fruit tarts, custard, and a bunch of macarons. Definitely recommend getting macarons as they are fresh, delicious, and only $1.10! Very affordable for macarons. The fruit tarts were also very delicious as the fruit tasted sweet (and not preserved). The tart bottom was sooo sweet as well. The eclairs and custard were not my favorite as they were not as flavorful as I expected them to be. Maybe that is the French way to make them, I am not sure and I probably prefer things on the sweeter side. But I definitely recommend this bakery, it is a must try!"

            "review": "I love the sprawling casualness of this place. They have a ton of stuff to offer, both savory and sweet. The quantity to price ratio is also pleasantly high, especially for a French bakery.  On our visit we tried the beef bourguignon stew, the split pea soup, and a mushroom quiche. While the food quality didn't knock my socks off, it was filling and satisfying.  Some of the sweet items, like the croissants, are offered in different sizes, great for me since I like to try a bit of everything.  Heaps of VERY brightly colored macaroons piled up at the case near the entrance. At $1.10 a pop, they are bite-sized, chewy on the inside, and not too bad tasting, probably my second favorite place to get macaroons in town so far. Overall a good place to come for a casual meal."

The frasier had the perfect amount of sweetness, balanced with the tartness of the strawberries. I also liked the texture of the cream and the cake, with the added sliced almonds for some crunch. I must admit that I am not a fan of macarons, but because of Patisserie Manon, I might become one now! :) although the macarons were not pretty per se, they all had wonderful flavors. I also liked that the texture is chewy, which was different from other macarons that I've tried. I also had an iced latte to pair with my pastries! I think they did a good job in crafting my drink (this comes from a coffee lover)! Kudos to the amazing staff, especially Joey!\n\nI have yet to try their breakfast and lunch menu. I think they're all worth my extra hour at the treadmill;)"

I've ordered multiple different cakes here and they are decadent! \n\nUnfortunately, there's always a first for a bad experience! I ordered a chocolate fraisier cake for my boss' birthday. I picked it up at 7am this morning because I knew they baked everything fresh in the morning.\n\nWe cut the cake up for 4 people and one of the macarons had mold on it. Yes, mold! I couldn't believe it myself as I know they make their cakes fresh daily. \n\nWell there goes $32. So I called them first to see if they could make it right. I talked to the manager, Gabriel and he said to send him a picture in which I did. Then he replied and went as far to accuse me that that wasn't the same cake they sold me that I sent in the picture. They also wanted me to bring the cake back to the bakery!!! Are they kidding me?! First of all, I live in Centennial and I drove to Boca Park just for the cake and took it work at a hospital in Henderson. So they want me to go back to work and pick out from the trash and then bring it back to them?! They're really crazy!\n\nSERIOUSLY?! So not only did your cake have mold on it, now you are accusing the customer of making it up and there's no way at all that it could happen?! \n\nWell let me tell you it did have mold and I have the picture to prove it. It's right on top of the macaron topping that's clearly made distinctly at their bakery because theirs are uniquely plump! \n\nI have to say I am super let down that they didn't have any customer service skills to at least be sympathetic with the customer regardless if they believed it to be true or not. The owner flat out told me that never has it happened in 35 years and that he just doesn't believe me!!! WOW-all I can say is WOW! \n\nI'm sorry but you just lost a loyal customer and an avid foodie that people actually get their ideas of where to eat from! \n\nI'm disappointed and I will definitely not be coming back!"

I've never had quiche before and this was amazingly delightful! I really love this place. \n\nOn the way out we got a few macarons (chocolate, vanilla, and pumpkin), the chocolate pecan tart, and the something that started with an M and was next to the tiramisu, had grand marnier in it. The M something was good but I am not a fan of alcohol in my dessert and I could taste it, but it was very chocolatey and the texture was moist/wet and heavenly."

            "review": "Worst French food ever. Repulsive. I wanted French food one day and was guided here by all of the positive reviews but now I have NO idea what these others are talking about - it was disgusting. I'm now almost positive those people must be friends with the owners or something because, I'm sorry to say (and hear me out first!), there's NO way someone with a tongue and a mouth would like their food. I've had real French food (I'm not even referring to the expensive fancy kind) and this food wasn't even close to that. No pride in the quality or preparation and especially not in the taste. I wasted over $40 on food I couldn't eat, but to be absolutely sure - I tried at least a few bites of everything I purchased. I bought a sandwich, a quiche, the Ni\u00e7oise salad, and a pain au chocolat and the only thing decent was the pastry. Maybe they do those better, but the actual \"French\" food was vile. Ni\u00e7oise was cheap canned tuna that hadn't even been drained, canned green beans that hadn't been drained either, dry days old egg, canned olives, canned everything, and brown lettuce and all the other ingredients were poor and seemed filthy and definitely smelly. The quiche was soggy and looked/tasted like it hadn't been cooked thoroughly, had a soggy crust, and was virtually tasteless other than the soggy wet egg taste. The mushrooms were somehow hard and barely chopped. Service was poor and took a long time. The sandwich was awful as well. I can't remember the name but it was ham Brie butter and pickles - a favorite of French \"street food\" - and was awful. The Brie was the cheapest hardest Brie (normally a very soft delicate cheese) I've ever tasted in my life. The pickles were fine, the ham however was slimy deli meat you get out of a grocery store package - but worse. No idea where it was purchased, but Absolutely disgusting. Not at all edible. The only redeeming quality of the entire experience was the baguette used for the sandwich and the pastry. I scraped out the contents and made my own sandwich from it, but that was it. And I'm not even sure if they made the bread in house or bought it elsewhere. I'm sure I sound like a snob, and believe me normally I don't complain about food or write any reviews, but this was SO bad and such a poor excuse for food that I felt compelled to review because I wasted soo much money on food I was so excited to eat and it was absolutely terrible and inedible. Much to my dismay, I threw most of it out, so I'm hoping to warn others not to waste their time OR money. Maybe their pastries are good, and they focus on that, but I have no idea, and I certainly won't be going back to find out. If pastries are their specialty, they should stick to that and remove the restaurant part all-together. I feel bad for reviewing so harshly but Im shocked a restaurant of such poor quality exists and even more so that it had SUCH good reviews. Hopefully they will improve their quality over time and take pride in their food and its preparation/ingredients/taste because Vegas needs more French food."

            "review": "How excited was I when I spotted the sign guy on the sidewalk flipping an announcement for a French bakery?  Marveilleuse!  A bakery/bistro on a route that I take routinely?  C'est magnifique!!!\n\nFinalement nous arrivons dans la Patisserie Manon!  \n\nThe pastries were varied, but gone is the delicate touch and size of traditional French bakeries, portions are 'American' super-sized.  When asked if the truffle pastry could be cut in half, serve half at the bakery, half to take home, we were met with such resistance and astonishment that we just ended up giving in and having it served in its entirety, only to throw away the uneaten half.  Honestly, it's enough for 3 servings, and would be better enjoyed in small doses because it is too rich for such a large portion.\n\nOur second choice was a puff pastry filled with a custard, again supersized, but not as rich, therefore more manageable to the palate in one sitting.  It was quite delicious, the puff pastry fluffy and buttery, and the custard was creamy and perfectly sweet without being overbearing.\n\nThe cappucinos, were weak in flavor, if frothy.  It almost tasted as if made of a regular roast coffee bean.  No self respecting coffee lover would call this a cappucino.\n\nThe actual location is large, but feels cold and sterile.  Bright blue formica tables and chairs more fitting for a hospital commissary and enough super bright flourescent lighting to perform microsurgery on an ant doesn't add to the ambiance, which is non-existent.  The layout is confusing and unwelcoming.\n\nThere's a lot of potential, both for the space and the menu, but it is a far cry from the warm, burnished familiarity of a neighborhood bistro.  In the land of faux finishes, they could certainly do with some mood lighting, cafe curtains, and bakery smells or the scent of broiled cheese on a Croque Monsieur (a French bistro staple not on the menu), not the ding of a microwave.  Even a surly French waiter would be welcome in place of the two perfectly coiffed and manicured suburban housewives looking down their noses when asked to cut what basically was a piece of chocolate cake in half.\n\nSo my excitement lasted all of 5 minutes after walking in, alas I am not destined to have a convenient patisserie at my disposal.  My search continues..."

Cookie was moist, chewy and flavorful. Salted caramel macaroon was rich and had  great texture. The flan was not too sweet or rich which was perfect for my husband's preferences and the serving size was so big that I got to enjoy it too. I plan on going back to try their lunch menu, as well as some more sweet bakery treats!"

They're French btw.  We bought a chocolate eclair and some macaroons (lemon, mint and black cherry).   The eclair is very good.  My standard for eclairs is Baby Cakes at the M and these are very close to that standard.  It's not too sweet but just sweet enough.  The chocolate filling has a nice balance.   Overall, the eclair is pretty darn good.  \n\nAlso, we ordered the macaroons.  These are small and they are okay.  I would order them again but my standard for macaroons is Bouchon.  It's just not the same.  People, once you've had a Bouchon macaroon, you'll never go back to anything else.  \n\nI'm excited to go back to this bakery.  We really need something like this in Summerlin beside Leopod's.  This place is a bit hard to find.  It's in the parking lot behind Flemmings. -M2"

            "review": "The La Parisien Sandwich is the best sandwich I've ever had, and I am addicted to it. Even my 15 year old son is hooked. It's on a crusty French roll, freshly baked. It features brie cheese, baby dill pickles, and ham. I like get it with a small bowl of their split pea and bacon soup. It's enough food for two to share.The prices are reasonable in this bakery, and there are lots of options to choose from. The cakes, cookies, tortes, etc. are beautiful, as well as tasty. Very luxe and high-end pastries, but priced low. I love their lemon tart, and my son loves the Napoleons. The tropical iced tea is also excellent, and is unsweetened. I go to the salon a few doors down, which is how I discovered this place, and I find it verrrrryyyy difficult to resist visiting this bakery when I am at the salon. I would give this place five stars, except that I am not crazy about the atmosphere. Not sure that there's much they can do about that, without more space, though. Seriously, if they had more space/a little nicer restaurant table area; I'd be bringing my handsome husband here for some hot dates. They close for one month every year in the summer for vacation. I totally understand, respect, and admire that. But, I cry when I try the door and it's locked. This happens to me at least one time, every year during their vacation break... as I forget-- despite their best efforts to warn us in advance, with signs posted about the upcoming vacation. It's tucked back in a shopping center off of Charleston, just west of Durango, behind Carraba's; so if you haven't noticed it and tried it, you need to go check it out."

The rose was my favorite. It was amazing! I loved the pistachio as well. I did get a good assortment and they were all amazing. Probaly the best macaroons I have had. I have lived various places so that says a lot. Even the cake was priced reasonable. We had the strawberry shortcake. Was amazing. We got so full off everything. I plan to get a fruit tart next. Great location. It was very clean. Staff was very attentive and I actually got helped very fast. I have been here 2x now and plan on going once a month. I will have something new everytime. I love trying new things. Everything looked amazing and it was hard to stick with just macaroons. I applaud small businesses like this. It takes a lot of hard work. I don't really understand any bad reviews which there are not many here. But imagine trying to please everyones taste buds. They seem to be doing the job quite well. I have to watch my waistline and limit myself. All in all, wonderful little place to get your sweets!"

            "review": "I had the pleasure of tasting a couple of their pastries offered at Leone Cafe in Tivoli Village, so I knew that I had to make my way over to the actual bakery eventually. For my birthday, I wanted something different from my usual trip to Freed's Bakery and realized that instead of being constrained to cake, I could indulge in one of my favorite desserts: Tiramisu! I've had good (and bad) tiramisu at various restaurants, but I had to do a little research for an establishment offering a complete dessert rather than single servings. I discovered that Patisserie Manon offered a tiramisu cake via search, so it was decided!\n\nI called to ensure that there were whole cakes available on Tuesday evening. Not only did they have the tiramisu cakes available, there are different sizes! That day, there were three (3) sizes available, noted in terms of how many people it serves: 4, 5, or 6. Prices start at $24 and increase in $6 increments to $36 for the largest. I opted for the \"6-person\" cake for $36 and requested a 'Happy Birthday' greeting. The individual assisting me via phone was very helpful and assured me about reserving the cake and having a chocolate birthday piece to place on top of the cake. Fabulous!\n\nI arrived at the bakery approximately 10 minutes later and they were very busy (it was around 5pm)! We had to wait in line with everyone else for the pick-up, but that gave me a chance to check out all the other delectable pastries, cakes, and cookies. The tiramisu cake is beautiful with large dollops of fresh whipped cream and a pile of broken chocolate pieces in the center. I love the dainty 'Happy Birthday' chocolate piece they included!\n\nThe \"6-person\" cake can easily serve 8 big slices and even stretch to 10 smaller ones! I cut the cake to create eight slices and they were still HUGE! I can't imagine anyone eating a slice if it were cut into just six! I still have almost half the cake left. I could have probably gotten away with the \"4-person\" cake and not have leftovers. Either way, it was very delicious! I'm not a big chocolate fan, but I found myself munching and really enjoying the chocolate pieces (it's a bit excessive; definitely for decoration purposes).\n\nP.S. Their Fraisier cake is soo good!"

I remember being out on the golf course in Palm Springs a few years back.  I remember seeing a bunch of mini-birds running across the fairway.  I asked my friend, what the heck is that?  He stated, those are what you call a Road Runner. Funny, that was my first time to ever see a Road Runner in real life and never expected them to be so small.  Yes, I was one of those that thought a Road Runner was the height of an ostrich.  I guess I watched too many cartoons as a child.  \n\nNow fast forward to my first macaron.  The only thing I ever knew about a macaron was what I've seen in pictures or what I've seen on Yelp.  I honestly expected a macaron to be the size of a burger slider.  You can now see why I thought of \"Meep Meep\" when I first walked into Patisserie Manon.  I didn't expect a macaron to be so small, like a Road Runner.\n\nSmall, but huge on taste.  These little road runners tasted so good and I don't even have a sweet tooth. Tried their Orange, Lemon, Cherry, Blueberry, Cafe, Vanilla, and Caramel.  All were good and would have to say that Caramel had to be my favorite.  These little treats are served cold and if not kept cool, will begin to break apart.  Because they are bite size and so tasty, it was easy to finish the box.  Sorry Honey, Daddy still left you a few.  You snooze, you lose litte girl!!\n\nService was great and the ambiance reminds me of a cafe.  But not like one of those fast paced cafes ala Starbucks, but one where you can kick it and enjoy your macaron.  The macarons have a certain bite or kick to them.  You will notice it a few seconds after your first gobble.  Their other desserts also looked good, but I didn't try them. Maybe on my next visit.  \n\nThanks Yelpers...you guys got me here.  You guys helped me realize that I actually have a sweet tooth.  Now looking forward for my next Road Runner, I mean Macaron. And of course, I recommend.  \n\nMeep Meep!!"

Each macaroon is a dollar and the meal was ~10. \n\n- Greatest macarons I've tasted yet! true to the flavor. My favorites are the chocolate mint, vanilla, and pistachio. least would be the blueberry surprisingly. Most of the macarons are very thick and chewy, which i love. I don't like the airy ones with a light crisp, which is probably how they are supposed to be made. There's is still crispy despite the chew.\nPresentation of macaron is unique. very soothe surface, but seem to still be individualized since the shapes vary. I like how they put bits of pistachio and how the the purple macaron is actually cherry. haha. they use a lot of dye.   \n- Cheapest macaroons! I've been to a lot of macaroon places in the OC and LA, and I think that this place tops them all. I say that bc pricing drives most of my decisions. lol. it's really cheap. Macaroons in socal are range from 2 to 3 -ish. \n- Turkey croissant is very cheesy and crispy. delicious. nuff said.\n- Small portion of soup. Very few chicken pieces, but big. noodles are mushy, but overall still tasty. \n- Can't wait to come back and try their other pastries!\n\n^____^!!! ^__^!"

The coffee was illy coffee which I always enjoy over regular Starbucks or Coffee Bean. \n\nI can't say much about their dessert pastries yet but I'll be sure to come back to try this because they definitely looked pretty appetizing. \n\nI give this place a 3/5 as of right now but don't let me review stop you from trying this place at least once.

I realy enjoyed the pistachio and raspberry, but was not much a fan of the mango nor salty caramel. \n\nThe mango macaron had that fake mango taste, not very appetizing, and salty caramel, I just don't think is a good flavor for a macaron. \n\nBut the raspberry and pistachio macarons were delicious and will return to get more of these flavors and probably try some others. \n\nThey are $1.25 a pop btw."

Say What?!\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect or what to compare them to. They look like colorful plump cookie sandwiches. A flavored filling is wedged between 2 cookies that are crisp on the outside but moist & chewy on the inside. They were good but a little too sweet for me. I did enjoy the coffee one.\n\nI also tried the Eclair & Fraisier. The fraisier was wonderful! Not as sweet as the macarons and the thin almonds were a pleasant addition.\n\nA great French Bakery to try."

I tried the regular croissant, almond croissant, the peach strike and some macaroons.  The macaroons were a big disappointment, first they didn't have the crunchy outside and chewy middle that you'd expect.  The rise on the macaroon was too high and you can tell they used more flour than almond flour.  The filling is just your regular filling, the strawberry was just this overly sweet jam, the peanut butter was just peanut butter slathered onto the cookies.  Really nothing to write home about.  The croissants were okay but definitely not worth my drive to and from this place."

I started coming here years ago before they become so popular and the macroons were only 75 cents (possibly less) and everything else was cheaper than what they have risen to after becoming popular. I've had just about everything and love their tarts, croissants, and deli items in the back. But I am sad to report that their cakes, while very pretty, are kind of bland and they use that whip cream frosting that I can't stand.Think grocery store cakes.... Why can't bakeries use real frosting anymore?? We've purchased several of their expensive cakes for birthday and celebrations and none of them actually tasted good and were wasted because nobody wanted to eat the cake after having a first bite. But that is just my preference on cakes and perhaps I am the odd ball."

Oui.\n\nBefore we talk about the food lets talk about the baked goods cause my lord the baked goods. I went at like 8AM on a Weds and still ate like 50 dollars worth of cakes, cookies, and tarts (love a good tart... or a bad one... especially the bad tarts...) Other reviewers go into this in detail but I'm not really a macaroon expert I just know these were delicious- very macaroony. \n\nFood\n\nThings I have eaten so far\n-Croque Madame- its a ham and cheese sandwich with more cheese and a cheese sauce and a fried egg. Take that clean arteries. \n-Quiches- real men don't eat quiches, but luckily I am a fancy boy so I do. Spinach and goat cheese is respectable, as is mushroom and bacon but the quiche Loraine takes it IMO.\n-Omelettes- If you know 3 things about the french its that they surrender, they are snobs, and they love omelettes. The last 2 really work in your favor here as the omelette is top notch.and you can get a large swath of ingredients added to it- Brie is a great one as they put two huge slices of it right on top. \n-Baguettes- I know, how good can bread be? Pretty good. Hot bread with butter is one of the simplest and most delicious things in the world and this place knows their way around the oven.\n-Croissant- pretty damn good. Extremely flaky and buttery, the opposite of how I like my women."

Thursday I bought spinach and goat cheese keish  when I started to eat it the spinach was bad so I called and the lady told me to bring it back down and gave me another one and said he would let owner know... I started to eat the second one and it was bad also so I called and told the lady... The next day I called and asked about a refund or credit and was told that the owner said that there was nothing wrong with the food because no one else had complained... So I called and asked for Becky who is usually very nice to me but she got on the phone and was rude as ever to me... She said that the owner had spoken to her about it and that I was lying about the food and that she can't go against what he says\nShe stated to me why do you keep coming ording the same thing and you've had so many problems in the past... I told her I would never eat there again and she said to me who cares and hung up the phone in my face\nI couldn't believe it and was bothered by this... It's a shame when the popular business doesn't care about losing loyal customers but it okay but I did report them to the health department regarding all my experiences that I've had with them and I just say to anyone else if you are new watch them make your food closely"

I must say they are definitely one of the best we have had :)  Like many reviewers had already commented, they are \"smaller\" in size but makes it back in taste!  The rose was very unique but I really like it, it's has a light floral taste without feeling I'm actually eating a rose.  \nOnly suggestion I have is a better 'box' to carry these in.  Right now, it's just being tossed into a box which is fine for winter, but in the 'warmer temp' - all the macaroons fillings were melting by the time we got home :("

And to be honest, I would never have ordered that unless I was with my friend, but by golly that beef was tender!!!\n\nEveryone that works here is so nice as well.  Staff is so polite, I love that.\n\nMy one critique is that they can make their macarons look better.  With so many competitors around, they don't seem to have much attention to detail put into them.  But who am I to say?  I've never made a macaron in my life, I just eat them."

The first time, I bought one and it was sooo good that I bought six more to share with friends, and then two days later I bought another six plain croissants and an almond croissant to take home to the Bay Area! These huge croissants left no room for anything else in the pink bakery box. I even saved extra space in my luggage for the box of buttery, light and flaky croissants! Haha, yes, I had to put them in my carry-on bag because we flew on Spirit Airlines. \n\nEverything we tried was as mouth-watering as they looked. Delicious French Apple Tart. Tasty and colorful French Macarons ($1.10 each). I tried the ginger and raspberry. Both were great! The Macarons had a smooth, crisp shell with a chewy, moist and flavor-packed interior. The apple square strudel-looking pastry was very good, which we enjoyed at the house, poolside, beer in hand. \n\nLots of eye candy in the display cases and in the covered trays. I was in carb heaven! If you are into flan, they have several varieties, and each slice is huge. I can't wait to go back and try out more stuff, especially the French onion soup in the caf\u00e9 section. Borrowing a term from Ken K, the baked goods at Patisserie Manon are \"sexcellent\"."

This place is totally worth the drive and I've been telling friends about it all week. \n\nKind of weird that they have the daily specials outside the door but not at the counter. And the girl didn't know prices when I asked. They have soup and sandwiches, but also several French comfort food options - pork cassoulet, beef bourguignon, coq au von and escargot. Sorry I'm sure I butchered those names. I went with the bourguignon and escargot just to try and although the escargot was underwhelming (think they use unsalted butter?) the beef was exceptional. It was perfect for a cold November afternoon - a huge amount of tender beef braised in a super rich red wine sauce with carrots over a little penne pasta for a mere $10. Portion is def enough for 2 to share. \n\nAlso picked up some things from the bakery - ginger macaroons were delish. Cake and even fillings were really light, my friend said it was the best coconut cake he's ever had. Service was friendly, but not great - girl at food counter didn't know pricing for specials, girls at pastry counter saw me standing there for a few min but just kept talking to each other on the side. You don't need to help me right away but pls at least acknowledge that I'm there.  Regardless ill still be back for the food and their whole cakes are also beautiful - not just your typical options of chocolate or yellow."

I get my hair done 2 doors down and had been running non stop all day until about 3pn right before my appointment .   Blood sugar was getting low and I had to go for groceries after hair and had 5 minutes.   The food in back was sll to much to eat and too slow    I opted for bakery and selected a lemon tart which was also too much.   I only needed a couple bites of something to hold me over do I asked the blonde woman with shortish hide is she could cut it in quarters   '\"NO\".  No explanation just no.   When I explained I was going to be sitting in a salon chair for a couple hours and only and cracked a joke about temptation of editing the whole thing if I could just take one piece and put the red away I was faced with a condescending \"maybe you should try some self control\"\n\nLet's forget for a minute this person sells Food and self control is the enemy of her business ...   She just insulted me because I like to eat and it shows.    Of course she had no way of knowing I've lost well over 100lbs Nd work like a dog to lose weight and have a very little treat now and then....   But really?  \n\nIt was one if those situations where the best response popped into my head after I left.\n\nIf I had it to do again I will say \" you know, you are right\".  And hit the door\n\nIn recounting this story to several other people who have visited this business the first question was \"what did she look like?\"   Follow by  \"oh that's the owner.   She!'s awful.    I don't go there any more\" \n\nI definitely recommend practicing your own version of self control by going elsewhere \n\nRudeness should never be rewarded.

It is a spongy cake soaked in a light simple syrup with a layer of butter cream, peaches, more spongy cake, a caramelized shell like topping, with granules of sugar on top. My sister and I got that and five Macarons for less then $10. That monster of a cake was only $4 and change. We had no fork and lost our dignity as we tore into this cake while parked outside. If self respect means eating with utensils, you can keep it, because I want my cake now. That was not even the end of our sugar trip. We had got two Ginger, one Raspberry, one Peanut Butter, and a Blueberry Macaron. We could not resist trying the ginger. Crispy outside shell, soft and chewy inside with a nice lingering taste of this medicinal root had me on cloud nine.\n\nUpdate: Talked to Jade W. It is called the Tropizienne. Remember that name."

It's a cute place with all the baked goods on the left side and tables on the right. So the macaroons are delicious and small but they are so flavorful. They have a variety of flavors such as Chocolate, Chocolate mint, Lemon, Blueberry, Pistachio (my fav), Raspberry,  Ginger, and a few others that I can't name at the moment. The macaroons are nice and moist with a small crunch and boy is it a burst of flavor in your mouth. I had to go back again and my parents loved it and they're not into sweets as much as I am ! Oh and they accept credit cards so that's always good. The staff seemed nice but she looked like she didn't want to be there. But she gave me my little box of my macaroons and off I was."

Each of them are $1.10 a piece which is EXTREMELY rare with macarons! A box of 10 were only about $11.00 for me! \n\nThe only problem I had with them is how easily they can break.

Fast forward a  few years later, and they've become a favorite local hotspot, and the staff has been beefed up, especially for the mornings. \n\nOriginally, our plan was to grab our usual favorites-Tart Tropizienne and Salted Caramel Macarons, but as I made my way toward the Bistro section, we decided to stay for a bite to eat. I spied some Escargot and also a nice slab of Foie Gras, but it was a little too early in the morning, so that's another excuse to return. We shared a small Hachis Parmentier, which is Manon's version of Shepard's Pie, a Croque Madame, and a cup of Zucchini-Cream Cheese Soup as suggested by our waiter.\n\n Sounded like a wierd combination, but the soup was actually quite good.\nThe Parmentier was also very well seasoned and flavorful without being very greasy, but our favorite was the Croque Madame. Just enough ham, cheese, and bechamel between each layer of crusty batard slices, one of many types of breads baked daily by Jean-Paul and not out of a bag, top that bad boy, or shall I say girl(with the addition of the egg, this dish becomes feminine....no comment....ask the French!) with an egg and you got yourself a French style breakfast of champions!\n\nOn our way out, we grabbed some Salted Caramel Macarons, and a nice crusty baguette to enjoy at home with some queso and vino....ALOHA!!!"

My cousin tried the ham croissant, turkey croissant and a tomato soup.  My sister got a beef bourguignon.  We all shared and tasted each other's food.  I loved everything we ordered as it reminded me of being in Paris.\n\nAs for their macarons, I ordered 3 of each flavor.  They're the scariest looking macarons I've ever seen.  They look nothing like Parisian macarons from Laduree.  They're lumpy and oddly shaped.  Well-made macarons are supposed to be smooth, shiny with well-formed feet.  However, if you close your eyes and bite into one, they actually do taste great!  My favorites are chocolate pistachio, cafe, caramel salt & butter, and pistachio.  Mint chocolate and ginger are eeewww.  We also ordered a slice of raspberry truffle.  Yum!\n\nAs if I hadn't eaten enough already, I also ordered escargot after eating some macarons and cake.  We also ordered a quiche Lorraine, mushroom and goat cheese quiche and a ham and bacon quiche.  If Patisserie Manon was any closer to my office, I'd be obese...but then again, nobody's obese in Paris!"

After dropping by, we were pleased to find out that the head baker was there, and he introduced us to the different cakes and told us what the filling was and the toppings, since we had some food allergies to go by. We went for a mousse cake with macarons on top, and the baker was even able to write a message for the birthday girl on a separate sugar plate in Chinese (he copied what we wrote) as well as a funny hashtag message.

The dressing has just the right amount of mustard and tanginess and was absolutely delicious. It is served as mescaline greens with chopped walnuts and huge croutons slathered with warm goat cheese.

I've tried the chocolate mint cake (not my personal fave, but I'm not a chocolate person) which is reminiscent of a girl scout cookie on steroids. The fraiser is my personal addiction and comes in slices- large for $4.xx and a smaller, more human-sized portion for $3.xx.

I was pleased that they prepared it slightly different than LT.  it was triple layer - top layer, bread and over easy egg;  layer 2 - swiss cheese, ham and b\u00e9chamel;  layer 3 - bread cheddar cheese ham and I believe some more b\u00e9chamel.  Loved it !  As with La Terre, the bread is amazing - I give a slight nod to Manon for the two cheeses but the sammie needed some mustard to cut thru some of the heaviness.\n\nAnother first - ordered an actual cake - my daughter was in town this weekend so knowing her and her boyfriend, they love peanut butter and chocolate, I opted for a chocolate cake with peanut butter cream and whipped cream.  $20 for a cake that easily feed 8 people is great value - especially for the quality of this cake.\n\nI have to ding them one star for the service - at times, the staff gives the impression they are doing you a favor in waiting on you.\n\npics attached"

Not too long after we parked and got off the car, she commented that she could already smell all the goodness seeping through the front door. \n\nThis neat bakery is hard to miss at night. Located across the boca park complex, the bakery flashes 'pastry. bakery. bistro' in bright neon red, visible along Charleston. Parking is plenty and location is pretty much around the center of the town and highly accessible. \n\nWe caught sight of the desserts early (who could overlook the colorful macarons?) on but walked over to the menu first thing to 'build our own sandwich', say baguette, turkey, lettuce, tomato, pesto and swiss cheese. The staff were really nice and even handed us a piece of 'prosciutto' when we asked what it was. While that was being made, we headed to get our sweet treats. Per Christina W.'s suggestion, I got the ginger macarons, and getting curious herself, my friend got one too along with chocolate pistachio & coffee. To my delight, they were all tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licieux! Fluffy and chewy! Seeing as we came from a long day at school, we treated ourselves to some meringues too - vanilla and coffee to be precise. The sandwich costed us about $9, but was enough for 4 people. We had so much left over that to-go was our only option. \n\nAt the end of the night, we thought that perhaps trying some new restaurants for our next hang out would be a good idea, but an even better one would be to stay in touch with sambalatte and manon so that we could go over their whole menu one day!"

Next time you're driving down Charleston passed the Whole Foods you'll see a guy waving an arrow sign that says, \"French Bakery\" turn in and check it out and least for the Macaroons.  \n\nI had been dying to try this place out and finally got a chance to on a Sunday afternoon.  They get 5-stars for quality and taste of the pastries but I had to only give them four for lack of friendly service and lack of signage once inside the bakery-which is ironic since they hired a guy just to get you in!  Maybe by the time you read this review, they will have made a few improvements.\n\nYou walk in you'll see one counter with pastries and cookies and some tables but  I wasn't sure if someone seats you, or if you can just sit wherever? \n \nThen towards the back, there's another counter (savory treats are here...sandwiches, soups, etc.) with another cash register, but you can't see the counter as you walk in. You have to walk all the way to the back while asking yourself, \"can I go back here\"?  Where's the sign? Can I sit anywhere?  etc. so very confusing for the customer. People just cut in line too, so if you're trying to read the menu, they just get right in front of you so stand next to the counter so they can't get passed you, regulars have radar for rookies.\n\nThe array of pastries seemed limited but it was late in the day so I'm sure they had already sold many? Macaroons looked homemade-not like they were made at a factory and they were so delightful just a rainbow of colors. \n\nThe cakes in the fridge are absolutely gorgeous!! I've never seen a cake like it before, decorated with gorgeous macaroons and strawberries, my hubby was nice enough to buy me one of these cakes for my birthday and -OMG DELICIOUS & BEAUTIFUL!  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=w3LLAst_f8jGPYwqOrXnog&userid=uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ\n\nI picked up two macaroons and a Tiramasu and wow all fabulous.  Tiramasu was creamy, light, full of flavor and the macaroons were also full of flavor. The orange one tasted like a fruit loop.\n\nNow that I know the lay of the land I may be back to try other items, but I will be back for more pastries and my military discount too."

I didn't receive 1 of my soups so I called the restaurant and the manager, Becky, was very frazzled by the issue and though she wasn't \"rude\" to me I overheard her cursing at one of her employees and saying she didn't know how to handle the delivery situation. Instead of checking the order to make sure what I was talking was true she proceeded to put the responsibility on the delivery people when by her explanation of how the process worked technically it's still the food establishment's fault but I digress. She said she would talk to the delivery people and that I would receive a response. I called again a little later and she told me that the delivery people were going to call me. I ended up calling EAT24 and they gave me a refund and solve the issue in 2 seconds. I was disappointed by the way the manager here handle this situation and the soup I did get was the wrong soup. On top of that the quiches were bland, and honestly I've had better macaroons. I don't think I'll be doing business with this place again."

The \"cookies\" exude freshness with their thin, crisp shell surrounding a just moist center.  The gentle caress of almond accentuates every flavor of not too sweet filling.  The nut flavors are outstanding but for $1 each, indulge in them all!\n\nTrue Parisian style breads (great crust, great chew).  Tearing lustfully into a baguette with your bare hands, smelling it then enjoying its flavor with a glass of wine is hard to beat.\n\nOutstanding croissants.  Flaky, not to buttery, with the perfect kiss of sweetness and saltiness.  Eating them naked is the only way to go. (You guys know what I mean - plain croissants).\n\nGreat looking shop.

It was a bit pricey for 50 cents or a dollar a piece the size of a quarter, but has some substance to it and is so chewy and soft compared to the sugar rocks I've eaten before in New York. \n\nI also had an apple pastry with almond/pear spread beneath on a flaky crust that was to die for. I think that was about $4.00. \n\nThe chocolate croissants are small and a bit more chewy/hard than I'd like, but still good. There are two different kinds depending on if you want more or less chocolate, and each of those are about $2.25.\n\nWhile it's not the cheapest grocery store bakery, it's also not grocery store quality.

            "review": "I've definitely experienced better. Not to ish on this place too much, but looking at the stars they could use a reality check. \n\nFirst, this place is far from the Strip, so no, not convenient for many visitors like myself. \n\nSecond, the set-up can only be described as bizarre. Inefficient and unorganized, without any indication that the goods are fresh. Nor any faith that this place is concerned about cleanliness. Just my observation. They literally have several display cases that are randomly placed near the entrance. The back of the business is a sandwich/restaurant. They have an industrial, kitchen work counter on which they have placed a majority of assorted meringues. They have this rogue display case with coffee and chocolate eclairs. They have some French condiments on the right hand wall. They have a candy abstract tree on the wall in-between the bakery and restaurant. They have two creepy mannequins, maybe they are for Halloween. \n\nThird, the macarons were crap. I've dabbled, and my meager attempts shamed this self-proclaimed French bakery. One of the macarons I was given had feet on only one side. The consistent problem with all the macarons was they were hollow, thus made improperly. Macarons are a difficult dessert, and I did not feel any of the macarons I received nor viewed were fit for basic bakery standards. I ordered a Salted Caramel, Rose, Strawberry, and White Chocolate Coconut. They were not good macarons, by a long stretch. Hugely disappointed. I only ordered 4 (at $1.25 each) because I could tell by looking at them that they were unlikely to be up to my standards.\n\nFourth, the Mille Feuille was awful. It was neither fresh, nor packaged well. Plus it is $4.75, what a rip.\n\nOn the only positive note I can comment on, besides the decent (if painfully slow) service, was the Fraiser (strawberry, toasted almond, white cream cake), which was delectable. But, considering this was an item I only ordered because nothing else looked very appetizing, this is not enough to even warrant 3*s. Plus, I wish it tasted fresher.\n\nYeah, probably not willing to come back."

I've also tried their other pastries like mille feuille (Napoleons), strawberry tart, chocolate truffle cake, eclairs, cream puffs, opera cakes, and other bakery items like their quiches and breads. I've also tasted all 15 flavors of the macarons. My favorites are pistachio, ginger, french vanilla, and coffee flavors. I've yet tasted their savory menu like their soups and sandwiches. And I don't have much interest in the candies/chocolates they also offer, but I bet you they're also bomb. Everything I've tried all tasted so heavenly, so delicious, I could imagine Marie Antoinette eating her cake right there beside me. I would say the whole setting of the place is a bit awkward though. They need some serious feng shui to fix their flow. It's nice to see that some of their employees are actually French. It adds a nice touch of authenticity to the place. And hearing an attractive male speaking in a French accent just adds a little sweetness to the already sweet pastries around *winks \n\nManon is my go-to place whenever I'm craving pastries. They're a lot more affordable than the pastry shops at the Strip and still taste as good."

I have tried almost all of their pastries and nothing has disappointed me.  Their \"cakes by the slice\" are huge and delish!  The cakes are moist and the fillings are not overly sweet.  The Frasier cake is my fave!  They use quality ingredients here and it shows.\n\nThis bakery is great for parties and during the holidays.  They make the cutest \"buche de Noel\" during christmas season."

            "review": "After seeing so many reviews and pictures of this place, I had to try it out for myself. It's a 5 minute drive from work, which may not be a good thing for my diet. My first visit was with my mom, who happened to be in town. We decided to split a small ham and cheese croissant and a dutch apple tart. We ordered 2 coffees as well. When i took the first bite of that croissant I was taken aback at how many different buttery layers of crusty goodness it contained. It was literally perfection on a plate. It had a mild melted cheese balanced with a sweet savory ham and it took my breath away. We both looked at each other marveling at the taste. I couldn't believe how good this little $2.95 sandwich could be and neither could she. It was THAT GOOD! So simple, yet insanely rich and flavorful. The tart was delicious as well and made the perfect ending to the breakfast. The coffee was refilled constantly while we stayed to chat well after the food was finished. This kind of establishment is part of the reason I love this city. You can go to an authentic French bakery and bask in the splendor of feeling like you're in another time and place, then pack up and head back to reality a five minute drive away. I've returned to Patisserie Manon on several occasions since that first visit. Service has been continually friendly and attentive. I've since tried the apple flan and some macarons, which are divine. I'll never stop ordering that ham and cheese croissant though."

I wish I could have brought back a few hundred chocolate croissants and Croque Monsieurs. I immediately began to look up french bakeries and patisseries on Yelp and found quite a few. There were some I had already been to and I had been to this bakery before but really didn't appreciate it.\n\nI went one morning and decided to try their chocolate croissants and to my surprise they tasted very closely to the ones I had been eating in Paris. The filling was creamy and light, and of course chocolate. The croissant was light, airy and crumbly which surprised me since our water is so hard here in the valley. The baker is a master at this establishment! We also purchased a couple of macaroons as well which I found to be very tasty.\n\nI came back a couple of weeks later to have lunch and ordered the Croque Monsieur. It tasted completely different than the ones I had been eating but still had lots of interesting texture and was filling.  Of course the bread didn't have the same consistency or moisture but I have to realize that I am living in the desert and not on the banks of the Seine.\n\nOverall, my experiences have been very positive at Patisserie Manon and I will continue to patronize their business when I need a moment to return to the beautiful country of France or need to satisfy a craving!"

I asked about ingredients for the macaroons and you'd have thought I asked someone to give me a kidney!  It was a tremendous effort to get a question answered.  My son can't eat citric acid, which is often an additive in foods, and the woman I asked about it actually said, \"you're not going to make me call the owner are you?  Just try it, and if you don't like it I'll give you back half your money.\"      WHAT?   We'd already had the quiche for breakfast so let it go, but who the heck speaks like that?  Always happy to give credit where it is due, but staff like that should be called out.   Also, if someone is allergic to something, you don't \"try it\" to see if it's \"okay\".

Here's what I got:\n\n- St. Honore cake - the toffee was good, but the chocolate cream in the puffs tasted bland. The puffs were also kinda stale and the whole dessert just looked thrown together. \n\n- Opera cake - for some reason it just tasted refrigerated and stale. \n\n- Mille feuille - the custard in this dessert was so eggy, it reminded me of an egg tart (where it all starts to gelatinize) rather than be a creamy custard.\n\n- Fruit tart - the fruit was good but the custard was also the same weird eggyness as what was in the mille fuille. \n\n- Baguettes - THE SAVING GRACE. Delicious, but the size was definitely more American (bigger) rather than the traditionally thinner baguettes with flattened ends. \n\nAll in all, rather disappointing. However, the baguettes were delicious. The service of the staff was OK."

We explained but he wouldn't listen that we'd already paid for these items. He was insanely rude.

Then we do the same thing for dessert.  \n\nThe $8.95 lunch combo is great bang for your buck.  You get your choice of a soup (usually more than 5 choices), sandwich (baguette, croissant or panini) and drink.  The baguette sandwich is HUGE.  They cut it into quarters and could easily feed 2.  I'm still trying to perfect my ideal panini but prosciutto, swiss, onion and mustard did me fine.  \n\nMy wife loves the quiche.  We've tried the four cheese, veggie and bacon and the mushroom.  To have one of these everyday would be amazing.\n\nWe always try to save room for dessert and usually split a tart or some kind of cake.  Eclairs, black forest cake, assorted macarons, fruit tarts..I feel like I'm on a game show and need to make a choice asap.  But alas I shouldn't feel pressured! I will be back for more!!"

My favorite flavors are vanilla (basic but still a great flavor), salted caramel (not overly sweet with the perf amount of saltiness), coffee (not too strong but still distinctly coffee), rose (not for everyone because some of my friends hate it? worth a try tho), and mango (the best fruity flavor there in my opinion, but that's coming from someone who dislikes fruity macarons).\n\nDefinitely worth the drive."

The ginger, blueberry, and other flavors are great as well. We usually get a multicolored assortment and the price for them is reasonable. Tarts are heavy and delicious, flan is light and sweet, I haven't tried many chocolate pastries and cakes because I'm not a big fan of chocolate. The cakes and pastry selections are a treat, although I didn't love the raspberry strudel I got because it had just way too much filling that it was overwhelming, and the quiches and sandwiches are yummy. I recommend the quiche combo with a quiche, salad & soup and drink for a little above $10 including tax. This was the first time I ever had a quiche and it was perfect, light and airy but filling. The cakes are beautiful but a hit or miss depending on your taste. Nothing I've had here besides the strudel was too sweet, thankfully, because I dislike pastries that induce me into a diabetic fit. No, I do not have diabetes. Yet. The only complaint I have with lunch is that the tea tastes like they used unfiltered water from the tap but then again I didn't grow up drinking tap water so it's not a deal breaker whatsoever. I love the cute little wall art they have and their selections and prices are reasonable. For a small patisserie, they do things well. I keep coming back."

I can't believe I just said that but this place out-Frances France.\n\nAs soon as I walked in I was greeted with a case full of buche du noel, the traditional rich, complex, decadent French Christmas pastry - only in flavors well beyond the traditional chocolate, to include Grand Marnier, pistachio, vanilla and coffee. I've had Payard's legendary buche, and the versions served here are simply a cut above. Sorry, Fran\u00e7ois.\n\nThe rest of the dessert case contains similarly irresistible treats - my focus was drawn by the amazing selection of cakes, which may well be the very best desserts anywhere in Las Vegas. And for like $4.30 per slice. Something like this on the Strip would cost you double and not be nearly this good.\n\nAlso of note is their baguette. They offer a crispy variety and a soft variant. I opted for the crispy on my visit and discovered a flavor that was less comparable to bread and more akin to the very best New York style pizza crust I've ever had.\n\nIt's a good thing this place is so far away, or I would be fused-to-the-couch fat."

I'd definitely go out of my way to pick up some of these.  The apple tart has a tasty crust and a mild, slightly sweet cheese baked into it. We enjoyed this pastry because it was mildly sweet and not packed with sugar like American pastries. The bread was fabulous with a thick tasty crust.\n\nNow the not-so-good: sausage croissant. In France it's \"sausage,\" but in America it's a HOT DOG.  Our jaws dropped when we cut into this croissant and discovered a HOT DOG staring at us.  We ate the croissant and fed the hot dog to our appreciative Great Dane.  \n\nOverall, we really liked this bakery and will return to try more of their items. Bonjour!"

Came here after studying with the bestie, and I'm so glad I made the visit. Although, they're going on \"summer break\" soon. \n\nLet's start with the good: MACARONS. $1 Macarons were welcoming. I had the Salted Caramel and Chocolate Mint. Salted Caramel: AMAZING. Mint Chocolate: EW. I love this place but this just tasted like bad toothpaste! I also ordered the black forest cake. It was just okay. It honestly just tasted like chocolate cake to me and wasn't anything out of this world. \n\nI hope to come back and try other pastries and the sandwiches as well. \n\nThe biggest point, I would say, is the decoration and branding. There is definitely some renovation to be done here. My sisters described the place as \"spooky,\" which is the opposite of what a place with great food like this should be. Also, it was a bit confusing to see that the biggest sign on the building actually said french pastry & bakery rather than the actual Patisserie's name. Definitely has great potential though!"

They have a wide selection of macaroons which is a total plus. AND they were $1.10 each! Possibly the cheapest I've seen for a macaroon yet .. \n\nBut, I'm not really a macaroon person. I've tried a good amount prior and they're all pretty sugared. And the ones here weren't any better. They didn't really taste like .. anything besides sugar. I had gotten a Rose one and a Raspberry one. Neither of them tasted of anything but sugary goodness. Kinda disappointed .. but their macaroons have interesting colors ..\n\nTheir mint chocolate macaroon was blue and their blueberry macaroons look like coal HAHA!\n\n I think the best place was Bouchon in Venetian for macaroons tbh. Their flavors were a bit more prominent in their macaroons.\n\nHowever, I simply LOVE their Fraiser. It was delicious. It was light but dense at the same time -- if that made any sense. The cake wasn't fluffy compared to some of the other ones I've had elsewhere. But their toppings weren't heavy cream or anything like that. They used whip cream and the piece of cake was covered in almonds, which gave it a wonderful flavor. It had a thin chocolate bottom as well. The piece of cake was huge and it was only like $4.50? It was enough for 4 of us. I definitely want to go back and see if I can get a whole Fraiser cake (for birthday/event)!! \n\n\nOverall, no to their macaroons.\nYes to their Fraiser.\nMay try other pastry items next time I stop by :)"

I had it bookmarked FOREVER.  Earl been wanting to go after hearing a retired pastry chef raved about how he would be a Patisserie Manon at least 3x a week.\n\nWhen we arrived, we definitely felt like kids at an ice cream shop.  Ooh I want this, I want that, wait, let's look at everything first before making our decision. \n\nOur final orders were:\n-Macarons: Caramel Sea Salt, Mango, Pistachio, Rose, Ginger.  I enjoyed all, though I haven't tried the ginger.  That one is Earl, and he hasn't eaten it yet.\n-Pain au Chocolate: I like this very much.  I will order it again. \n-Cheese Crossaint w/hot dog: Earl though it's a cream cheese crossaint, but no, this was savory.  We didn't enjoy this at all.  Pass.\n-Palmier:  Earl's choice.  It was crispy throughout.  Eh.  Nothing special.  Earl said that he was hoping that it will taste like the one at Babita's Coffee Shop in Long Beach.  It doesn't.\n-Strawberry Cr\u00e8me Amare (?): It looks like their version of the strawberry shortcake but instead of shortcake, it was a crossaint or something similar.  I ate half of it today and it is still good.  I heart this one and will get it again and again.\n-Meringue:  I just wanted to try...pass.\n\nThe young gentleman that helped us was super friendly and helpful.  \n\nWe will definitely come back."

So I came here wanting some macaroons and a nice cup of coffee. I arrived late in the day so I wasn't completely surprised that they were out of a lot of breads and such. No biggie since it wasn't what I came for. There were several macaroons to choose from but not the vast variety I would have expected. Also, they didnt put any care into arranging them. It's a french bakery, that's how the french do it. *sigh*\nYou order your macaroons in the front and bring them to the back to order your coffee. It would have been nice since I was eating inside to put them on a plate. Instead, they put them in a wax paper bag. *sigh* I gotta say, it's the little things that places do that really set them apart from others. This place certainly wants to blend in, not stand out. The have cute \"murials\" on the wall and that was a nice touch. \nSo, I go to the back and order my coffee, a small french roast. The cream and sugar are on the tables so you can make your coffee how you like it. As I scanned the tables, I noticed that most of them were dirty. It wasn't busy, so someone could have wiped down the tables and cleared the dirty dishes from previous diners. I didn't like sitting down to a table with crumbs everywhere. Gross.\nI was talking to a friend prior to going and she said that the fruit macaroons were better than the others (peanut butter, chocolate, etc). So I took her advice, for the most part, and only got 2. A strawberry one and a mint chocolate one. The strawberry one was nice. Nice flavor, nice texture. A OK to me. The mint chocolate one was crumbly and lame. Crumbly? A macaroon, crumbly? WTF? \nI'm giving the benefit of the doubt that on a Saturday morning, when all their products are out, that this place is better. My experience yesterday was definitely 2 star, but I'm hopeful it down to the time I came in. Had it been cleaner, and more stocked, I feel a 3 star would be more appropriate. \nPro for the macaroons only being $1. And a nice size small coffee being $1.75!!! In a town that loves ripping people off, I was happy about this. \nNot sure I'll go back, but I just might if the mood strikes!"

Ok now on to the food. The macaroons taste of pure sugar no flavor just sweet. The almond danish was so hard I could have cracked a tooth.

Then, I read LA Yelper, Tiffany C.'s and Rod U.'s (Hawaii) reviews -  I was even more encouraged!  When I saw Vegas Yelpers' reviews - Norm, Sylvia, Nelson, Terri, Mel, Ania, Stefany, and Philip -  that put me over the top!\n\nI just wanted a little dessert. I ended up with a Kiwi Raspberry Tart, a Mango macaron, and a Peach Rectangle Tart. Wow. The crust, the fresh fruit, the quality of ingredients. ..I could tell that it's authentic! \n\nThen, I ventured to the back of the shop... oh, no!  There is a separate cash register for the savory goods: soups, sandwiches, lasagna, French Hot Dog, croissants, and QUICHE!  OMG - I had just had dinner,  but I NEEDED a Quiche. ..but how to decide between Ham and Cheese,  Spinach, Goat Cheese, and many other flavors?  I went with the most popular: Quiche Lorraine. Ahhh. .. it was THE BEST quiche I had ever had!  That buttery, flakey crust and the \"broke da mouth\" combination of bacon, cheese and eggs made me continue my feasting! It was so fluffy and decadent! !\n\nI'm quite sure that I'll be back for more quiche and other goodies!  Vive la France!"

It's perfectly filled, not hard, no cracks, and no air when you bite in it. Plus they sell it the cheapest in Vegas for $1.25, most other places will start at around $1.75+ and be the same size but won't taste nearly as good. Staff is also very friendly and the place is a nice and large atmosphere."

You walk into one small unmanned counter on one side and three on the opposite. The main counters are run by staff, that presumably roams all three counters (?) but I was a bit confused. Baskets of lemon, orange and vanilla merengue, covered in plastic wrap, were sitting everywhere and it made me wonder if I had to have a store employee follow me around and bag items I wanted?...\n We settled on two GIANT slices of cake- chocolate and strawberry, at $4.75/slice that seemed a bargain. Quirky macaroons in colors of rainbow are priced at $1.25/piece. They aren't exactly small as some reviews mentioned. They are smallish in diameter, but very plump. We got chocolate mint, pistachio, vanilla and peanut butter. My 12 YO said vanilla was her favorite. Even just smelling the chocolate mint made me suspect the flavor would have been overbearing. \n I took a pistachio one for myself, flavor was very good and again, not too sweet, but it didn't seem super fresh. Like a \"sat in the fridge for a while\" aftertaste to it. \n Baguette was sort of an obligatory add on, it was ok, nothing to write home about.\n There is a deli sort of eatery towards the back, but we didn't venture. \n Another thing I didn't quite get was a sign that said boxes are $1 extra. So what does that mean- you can have your cake bagged? I didn't think to save a receipt for reference, but seems odd. \n Two ladies working the counter were helpful and a girl waiting on us was sweet.\nAll in all, entire experience seems haphazard and disorganized. Not really a reason to rush back."

I'll still be back before you can get it on the menu.  4.5**** until then.\n\nComing here hit the stress eating on the head yesterday.  A much needed splurge :-P. Was gonna have dessert first for dinner, then quiche for dessert.  It's okay if you do that too.  I'll like you more ; )\n\nSalmon and mushroom quiche: served hot with a tiny side salad. Salmon and mushroom had their own flavor.  Outside crust was just right crispy.  Center part was okay maybe soggy if I compare to other quiche I've eaten elsewhere.  Possibly due to quiches being premade.  Overall it wasn't over salted.  It was good - I finished it.\n\nGrilled chicken pesto panini: added brie cheese.  Made this panini super flavorful it beat the taste test of the quiche.  Plus it came with spinach soup.  Sip the soup alone or try dipping the panini in it; either way is perfect.  Also served with a tiny salad.\n\nDessert bakery section is where restaurant entrance opens to, with a separate section at the back for meal type food.  Drip coffee is served at the front; fancy latte type espresso is prepared at the back.  Tabs for the meals can be combined with dessert purchases- not necessary to pay separately.\n\nSelections are plentiful.  Everything in the dessert area is eye catching, colorful, beautifully decorated, slurpalicious worthy.  Definitely a place to trigger a diabetic reaction (for those just be careful and conscious).  Everything offered so far in the meal section is appetizing; you might want everything if you're starving.  \n\nFor sure I'll return to try lasagna as suggesteby Micah O. perhaps when family is over to visit.  I wanna taste the other quiche pies.  I'll try to stay away from the gigantic huge enormous dessert slices, but I know I'll fail.  Until my next stress eating binge - which I hope isn't so soon - catcha laterz!"

They are NOT the best macarons ever, far from it actually - but they are just a dollar, so what can I say? \n\nRose - Weird tasting. Avoid.\nLavender - Better than Rose, slightly fruity.\nRaspberry - Overly sugary. Weak flavor.\nSalted Caramel - Easily the best of their macarons. I'd definitely get this again.\nPistachio - Overly sugary again. Flavor was ok.\n\nAnd there were probably more, but only the salted caramel was memorable at all in my opinion. \n\nJust a note, but don't go here on rainy days. I went on a rainy day, and unfortunately, humidity matters a lot when making macarons, so almost all of mine were lacking the crisp texture and slightly crunch  you expect from a fine mac (I don't think this bakery has proper conditioning). Normally though, the hot, dry weather of Vegas would be fantastic for baking up these babies."

I was so focused on my sweets that I didn't even realize it until I got home and noticed I had an unexplained extra box. So, to the couple before me, I am so sorry!! I didn't return them because I figured you'd be gone and wouldn't want food from my trunk anyway. \nAs for the pastries... mostly very yummy. I ordered the rose, salted caramel, and pistachio macaroons. They were okay. I've had better. I've had worse. The rose was my favorite, but then again, it always is.\n     The slice of strawberry cream cake was huge! Super sweet and a ton of almonds on it. I'm a person who can pretty much eat sugar by the spoon and this cake was a bit much. I recommend it, but make sure you either split it with someone or cut it up to have over a few days. \n     As for my unintentionally ill gotten goods. Yeah, this thing is awesome! I don't know what it's called but it's chocolate cream between kind of a blonde brownie/streusel. Yes! Yes! A thousand times yes! Maybe next time I'm there, or their newly opening location on Rainbow, I'll pay it forward and buy something for someone.\n     Which brings me to price. The macaroons are a dollar something. That's about average, though they are a bit smaller than one usually finds. The pastries are generally $4-5, which, in a time of $6 lattes is actually not bad. \n     So go there. Have fun. Get fat like me! But if you don't want to stay fat, there is a lipo place conveniently located next door to Patisserie Manon. ;-)"

We decided to bring his mom and grandma along and this is another spot that is mom and grandma approved! \n\nWe all ordered what we wanted most, but shared bites.\n\nHam&cheese croissant- I am picky about them since sometimes it isn't balanced. I get disappointed when the ham is way too smoky or cheese is overpowering or the croissant isn't a nice consistency. This is one of the best I've had with a great balance of flavors. Yum! \n\nPate Friand- I love pate and this was pretty good. Only complain was the middle of the ball was a little bit cold, but still good that way. I just tend to favor a piping hot friand. \n\nSausage Friand- pretty good..I think a little mustard to dip it would make it better. I think I like the pate one slightly better. \n\nSpinach,garlic,cream soup- it was good homemade soup. It tasted like a spanakopita soup specially if you dip some flaky pastry into it. I dipped parts of the friands into it. \n\nBeef Bourguignon- this was a generous portion of hearty food. They put noodles on the bottom and it went really well all together. Beef was very tender and fell apart. \n\nPotato Salad- grandma wanted a side for her croissant. This is one for those who don't like the tangy styles of potato.\n\nWe also got to-go fruit tarts (Pear for us, Peach for mom&grandma). They were large and a good deal for the price. I thought it would be all fruit but love that it was part eggy custard. I also go a feuillte-  yummy chocolate mousse, hazelnut creme and crisp layers. Taste like a Ferrero Rocher candy but I much rather have this.\n\nThe staff is also very nice both occasions we've been in.\n\nThe BF and I definitely think this will be a regular spot for us.

When I inquired about the macaroons, he asked if I've ever had one, and when I said no, he happily handed me a chocolate one to try. \n\nThe standouts from my order included the layered cake with fresh strawberries and almonds as well as the flan. My kids like sweets, but often more along the candy spectrum because they're kids. I have never seen them fight over a piece of cake as much as the one with strawberries, (hey, at least they're eating fruit) I thought Fight Club 2 was going to break out in my dining room. The flan is like the Mexican flan I'm used to, but inside of a pastry crust so it's smooth but also has a great crunchy texture. It was also bigger than a slice of pizza for under $5 (I think) and may have ruined all other flan for us. \n\nWhile going to the after Christmas sales, I told my husband I wanted to go to French Connection and he retorted I want French flan.

Seriously this place is so legit French people are patrons of  the establishment!!!\n\nI've been on and off the strip in search of the BEST French Bakery and it is my opinion that one does not need to look any further than this place. Their food and baked goods are fabulous and I highly recommend a visit to this bakery. Since discovering this place, I have encountered stories from people as far away as Henderson that know of this bakery and make the 30 minute journey just for Patisserie Manon. \n\nMy first stop here was because it was close to the house and I was in search of breakfast pastry or two. Once there I noticed that they also had mini quiches so I purchased two to take home for my wife and all I can say is WOW (taste was great). Since that time, I have had the pleasure of having had and fallen in love with the following menu items:\n\nFrom the Bakery:\nBaguettes - Crunchy or Soft and oh, so light and wonderful.\nViennoiserie - my favorite is the Pain au Chocolate\nMacarons - As they should be with a crisp shell and soft airy goodness inside \nIndividual Cakes - Fraisier is my favorite followed by the Foret Noir\n\nFrom the Bistro: \nQuiches - various flavors but my favorite is still the spinach and goat cheese \nHam or Turkey Croissant\nCroq Monsieur - yum, yum - I like a fried egg on top of mine\n\nThere are more items on the menu that i have yet to get around to sampling, but the ones listed above are what I have tried.\n\nlets see, what else; the place is family owned, the service is great and the people are personable. \n\nThe only CON:\nLattes are a bit of a disappointment, it is my understanding that they just have a premix or something like that, which is fine since it is a Patisserie and not a Cafe. They do have regular coffee which is fine - also the premixed Lattes aren't bad or anything, I like the Mocha myself, I would just prefer the ability to order up a fresh made latte or an espresso sometimes. \n\n...after writing this updated review, I now feel the urge to go pay them a visit; damn them for being so close to my house."

            "review": "Ive been wanting to try Patisseire Manon for awhile now! It's located in Summerlin, by far the nicest part of Vegas. It's hidden and can easily be missed, its in the same complex as Whole Foods & Roy's steakhouse. When you walk in the bakery is in the front and the cafe with the food is in the back. For the food you have to go unto the counter to place your order. I built my own sandwich, there are several different options for bread, meats & vegetables. I chose a baguette with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes, olives & swiss cheese. It came out to around $7, when I got my order I had four half slices of sandwiches, which is ALOT. The bread was perfect, they bake it fresh in the back and the sandwich was light and good. I would say its well worth the $7, you could even share it with someone.  After wards I moved onto the bakery, I was overwhelmed by the selections of pastries & cake! They have several types of macaroons, meringues, eclairs,  tartelette, slices of cake & chocolate croissants. I tried a slice of the strawberry cake which was delicious! Its a favorite item and tasting how fresh the cake & strawberries were I can see why. Very light and fluffy. I also tried the cake made out of touberlone chocolate bar, at first bite it was extremely chocolatey and didn't think I could eat it. But after your taste buds adjust to the sweetness, your able to enjoy the flavors that remind you of how much you actually liked the Touberlone chocolate. I would recommend the strawberry cake on the safe side but if your a sugar fiend then Im sure you can handle basically any of the pastry selection here."

My search will continue. I want a light as air, crispy, thin shell, a slightly chewy middle and the perfect amount of filling. We tried almost all the flavors. Some almost had what I was looking for, others were too dense with no light crisp. Too much filling and too sweet for my liking as well. They were good, just not great."

Bakery is in shoppes in back) for more than a year now...time to share the not-so-secret news of their fabulosity. Being in the same strip mall as my Physical Therapy (now Pllates & massage) center has been both a blessing (I found them!!) and a curse (their yumminess can find my hips if I don't reign in my nom nom desire...)\n\nTruly is a bustling bakery with ample seating and cases of confections to tempt any taste. At one point or another myself or guests have probably tasted everything in the case (oink) in my defense: frequently I'll buy assorted pastries/slices of cake in lieu of a whole cake to allow for entertaining variety. Standouts here have been: chocolate tart (approved by my chocoholic Mom) Tropizienne, Napoleon, French Brest, lemon tart, the Noel Cake at Christmas & a special order Croque en Bouche I had made for a friend visiting from Paris for his birthday. And those divine Macarons: I'm torn because they had discontinued my favorite ginger and I fell in love with salted caramel in the interim: since ginger is back, guess I'll have to alternate. They are reminiscent of Lauderee and beyond reasonable at $1 each. I like to put a sleeve in a cellophane bag as a hostess gift, colorful and unique and many have never had a macaron before. Though not a coffee drinker, I'm told they pour a mean cuppa. Their brioche is spot on (and by far, at any bakery my go- to, so this is saying a lot) and their other breads and croissants win yummy labels often from all who take a nibble. \n\nThe husband and wife team of Jean-Claude and Rachel are friendly, obviously dedicated to quality and it shows as you savor their savory offerings in the bistro in back of the store. Soups, a variety of yummy sandwiches, some on their oh-so-light-flaky-buttery croissants, Croque Monsieur (my friend raved) the veggie quiche is delicate and delicious(I hear great things about their many quiche varieties) Nice place to meet some friends and catch up in a reasonably priced family owned business that continually delivers great taste, great service and inspires great willpower in me as I go to & from Pilates 2x weekly. Tres Bien.\n\nSupport locally owned deliciousness!"

Anyway, I have been frequenting Patisserie Manon every 2-3 weeks since then, as it is located in the Summerlin, Boca Park area.  I have been on the hunt for a bakery that can rival this  place; but alas, I have failed countless times. \n\nNow to the food.  Of course, their macarons are just schlamazing! My favorite is the salted caramel!  One of the cakes I enjoy most is the Frazier, which is this white cake, covered in thin, roasted slices of almond on it's perimeter, and has slices of strawberries between the three layers of delicious fluff.  Yum!  Most of the dessert items have one thing in common: having the right amount of sweetness.  It could be that this is something intended in French cooking.  Regardless, it's good and you can bet that the pastry chef know what he or she is doing. \n\nI've also ventured a bit deeper into the bakery, where their hot foods are made to order.  The quiche lorraine is my favorite.  I believe it has bacon and cheese (it's been a while since I've ordered it).  Their boeuf bourguignon is scrumptious.  The slabs of beef and slices of carrot are so tender.  The soup is so delicious. It's also served with a baguette, because this dish wouldn't be complete without you dipping it into the sauce with the trace of bergundy wine all up in there.  I'm hungry now. \n\nOverall, this is an impeccable establishment and I highly recommend visiting this place, even if you are just visiting Las Vegas."

But since that is quite a drive, I did a quick yelp search, found Patisserie Manon, read some reviews, perused the photos, bookmarked it, then dreamt about the delicious pillow sandwich cookies.\n\nAnd I am happy to say, that Patisserie Manon lived up to my expectation.  I actually also came in to have lunch but stopped at the bakery counter first to satisfy this craving.  One cherry and one coffee.  The crackly shell and chewy inside was perfect melt in your mouth deliciousness.  I ordered one of each of the 10 flavors to take home, as well. \n\nAlthough I originally searched this place out for the macarons, I'm glad I stumbled upon it, because lunch was delicious too.  I ordered the mushroom and goat cheese quiche.  Put 2 of my favorite ingredients in a perfect puff pastry, and I am a fan for life.  I ordered the ham and cheese croissant for my toddler, and although it was a good sized sandwich- she practically finished the entire thing by herself.\n\nPatisserie Manon is exactly what I have been missing about my old neighborhood.  That mom and pop feel where the prices and descriptions are hand written on fluorescent sheets of paper in the display.  But, more importantly, that homemade flavor.   There are so many items that I want to try- the pate, the escargot, the beef bourgignon. Not to mention, the other fabulous looking desserts.  No doubt I will be back again with hopes that it continues to be \"as good as it gets\"!  Bon Appetit indeed."

It's not often that a pastry makes you blush, but this French apple tart sure did ;-)\n\nThe macarons were amazing, but the surprise winner here was the raspberry gourmandise.

This patisserie is located on Charleston between Durango and Fort Apache tucked behind Fleming's, Carraba's and Bonefish Grill.  \n. \nAs soon as I walked in I had a familiar feeling wash over me like I had been there before.  The whole place feels cluttered in a clean way.  There were candy bins on the wall and leftover halloween decorations and about 10 baskets of scones hanging around.  Each basket had to have held about 100 scones...I wonder what happened with that...did they bake too many or did somebody place an order and never pick them up? LOL  \n.\nTheir pastries are large and not too fancy and I appreciate the utilitarian approach they are using.  The lady behind the counter was warm and inviting and the restrooms were clean.  I especially liked their toilet...it's a weird one....you have to pull up on this little pin to flush it.  Novelty! \n. \nThe croissant was flat, greasy, and not flaky at all, but has a lovely, delicate flavor.  I wish it were more buttery but it was very tasty.  That's what I get for picking up croissants at 8:30 at night I guess LOL \n. \nI'd definitely go back to get one of their pretty cakes and I saw beef bourguignon on one of their menu boards that intrigued me enough that I'm planning a trip here just for that."

So anyways , on this last visit this is what I found....\n\n1- if you order the macaroons, do not eat it right away. as soon as I got in my car I took a bite out of one and it tasted like \"refrigerator\". I'm guessing from it being too close from the vent in the showcase of the store. When I ate it about 24 hrs later, the refrigerator taste was gone. Which made it ok.  \n2- the girls in the bakery are friendly however the girl with the dreads made a comment to me to buy her one aswell (I'm assuming because I spent $60 on this one transaction) .. girl, your making this customer feel uncomfortable. You work here so go feed yourself a slice of cake on ur break. Whether it be a joke or not, you have a job , go buy your own... \n3- the girl with the green hair.. I saw her put on gloves to pick up the fallen macaroons in the display showcase. She took off the gloves and I guess missed one macaroon so I guess she was lazy to put a new pair on and I saw her grab it with her bare hands and place it back on top of the other macaroons in the showcase. Kind of nasty.\n\nCleanliness are this bakery isn't so great and the customer service is a little too friendly? I guess u can say. The cakes here are super delicious and regardless of me seeing an employee touching the food with their bare hands, maybe I'll come back again? Not so sure. But hopefully management reads this and betters their associates."

I had a mushroom and goat cheese quiche with a side of french onion soup, both of which were fantastic. There was a wide variety of meals in our large group, and all looked great! The desserts also were fantastic. I split a piece (which are very large!) of a strawberry cream dessert and it was by far the best choice.

            "review": "Seriously. Top-notch quality macarons for $1.10 each? Patisserie Manon's macarons were definitely worth my visit here! While there are lots of other pastries, baked goods, and delectable looking cakes in the front of the store, my eyes were set on the colorful macarons behind the glass display that greets you the moment you walk into the store. These macarons are a little differently shaped than the ones I am used to (more flat and cookie like) - these are strange puffed up shells making them longer and less wide than I am  used to. The color of the shells also look a little artificial because they are so bright. BUT, they were amazing. \n\nI bought eight macarons, trying to test all the different flavors. Overall, I felt that the macarons had a really puffy texture upon first bite, but then became chewy afterwards, making the perfect combination of shell and filling to give you that great macaron enjoyment. \n\nMy favorite flavors were: \nRose - not too heavy. It contained the perfect flowery taste to delight my tastebuds. And the shells were pink and white! \n\nSalted Caramel - I loved the flavor of the caramel! Not too sticky, but had a good consistency that worked really well with the shells.\n\nI also really liked lemon and strawberry. They didn't taste extraordinary, but they had very good taste. The strawberry even had bits of real strawberry inside of the filling. \n\nFlavors that were a-ok: \nGinger - Interesting flavor, but not my cup of tea. I love ginger candy, but I thought the taste was a little weird for a macaron. It was also really sticky. \n\nMango - It was interesting, but a bit too artificial for my liking. \n\nPistachio - I thought the pistachio had good almond flavor in the shell, and the filling was also decent. I'm not a big fan of pistachio macarons, but these were okay. \n\nMocha - It wasn't too strong on the mocha taste, but I liked it. Not memorable, but something I would try again!\n\nWhen I was buying the macarons, they informed me that they had salted caramel and mango in the back. I don't know if they would have told me this if I hadn't asked them about the flavors, but as I am a big salted caramel macaron fan, I would definitely have been bummed out if I missed out on this flavor! \n\nIf I lived in Vegas, I would definitely be coming by a few times a month to pick up macarons! And their cakes! They were gorgeous and very elaborate (but expensive!)! \n\nPatisserie Manon is located in a quiet plaza next to the Whole Foods market plaza. We weren't sure at first where it was, but we saw a man standing outside with a sign. I also saw another location for this place down the street. I guess they have two storefronts? They have lots of seating inside the restaurant, and I believe a caf\u00e9 where you can order drinks and sandwiches further inside the store. \n\nI definitely will be coming back when I'm in Vegas!"

This may seem pricey but it is well worth it in the end. \nAnd let's not forget the macaroons! \n(now these are not the nasty american coconut macaroons you are probably thinking of. these are French and authentic and delicious).\nFor only $1 each you can enjoy a variety of amazing flavors like vanilla, coffee, raspberry, strawberry, cherry, chocolate, lemon, and there's more hahaha. \n\nNow if you are watching your figure (or you have gone here many times before an simply indulged on all of these sinful treats) you can try and force yourself past the pastry counter into the back where they have their incredible breads and soups. \n\nToday I had their Mushroom and goat cheese quiche. It was quite possibly the most amazing quiche I have ever consumed in my life. The crust was so lift and delicate and the egg mixed with the goat cheese was the perfect consistency!\nMy fianc\u00e9 had the beef bourguignon and I must say, I have been trying to be a vegetarian and this dish blew it for me! \nThe beef was so tender and just melted in your mouth and the sauce was to DIE for! Never have I tasted anything like it before! \nIncluded in our lovely lunch/dinner was complimentary raspberry and/or lemon water. We ended this fantastic meal with two raspberry macaroons. \n\nNow if I were you I would go sooner rather than later. Because other people have realized how amazing this bakery is the food goes fast. And once it's gone it is gone until they bake it fresh the next day. \nso go go go!!\n\nYou wont be sorry :)"

Bouchon Bakery was the obvious place, but thanks to my Yelp app I also found Patisserie Manon tucked away in a strip mall.\n\nThere's much to like about this bakery: a huge assortment of classic French goodies, a section to sit down and eat savory items, and the flavor of the macarons. But the overall ambience of this bakery cafe is so stark that it doesn't have that cozy French feel that would make me want to return and hang out.\n\nOther reviewers had raved about the $1 macarons, so I thought, What a deal! Disappointingly enough, these macarons are also much smaller than at, say, Paulette's (Chantal G.). Think between quarter and half-dollar-sized. The texture of the macarons was perfect though: crisp shell and tender interior with good buttercream fillings. But the color choices put me off. I want my raspberry macaron to be light red or pink, not an odd adobe red color. Why was the vanilla macaron baby blue? Sure, if I close my eyes, the taste is great--but eating involves all the senses, and I make my food choices by sight.\n\nThe croissants were quite good--very flaky and buttery. Our half-baguette-long sandwiches (ham and Swiss cheese for me) were even bigger than anticipated and enough for two to share, at $8-something. And I was impressed that they had house-made pates for sale.\n\nWe also ordered coffees to go, and again the amenities dulled the experience. When we asked for sugar and cream, not seeing the customary station, we were directed to packets of sugar and half-and-half type individual creamers on the tables, which is where we also picked up our napkins--industrial style paper towels. :(\n\nGo for the food, but get it to go unless you don't care about a cozy atmosphere. The food is close to 4 stars, but the ambience is a 2."

My husband also tasted banana in it.  So I went to the counter because this wasn't what I ordered.  The employee was not very accommodating, she spoke with her manager, and then took another croissant off a different tray and put it on my table.  This one didn't have chocolate or banana in it. But it was hard as a rock just like the last one.  Aren't croissants supposed to be buttery and fluffy?  That's why one orders a croissant.  I couldn't finish it and left this establishment still hungry.  Benefit of the doubt, maybe the label was wrong and it was actually a bear claw or something else? \n\nHow much did it cost them to produce this single croissant?  Cents?  If the employee had just said, \"I'm sorry you didn't like it.  Can I get you something else,\" I wouldn't be writing a negative review."

If I was just dealing with the front of the store and talking about baguettes and croissants I would probably give it 4 stars but the other day I ventured into the back  where they serve coffee soups sandwiches and quiche. I was so very disappointed\nI ordered a croque monseur and a spinach and goat cheese quiche. What a letdown.  Since the word croque actually means crunch in french you would not expect the soggy mess I was served. The sandwich was three pieces of limp bread with a very small amount of flavorless ham and unmelted cheddar.  Why there was cheddar in a sandwich traditionally made with gruyere I have no idea. The top was covered in a bland bechamel sauce and gruyere. It was barely warmed through and the whole sandwich was soggy.  A total disappointment.\nNext on to the quiche. Under seasoned, watery with a limp crust. It seemed as if someone forgot to drain the spinach before It went into the custard. The pastry was pale and anemic with very little texture. I truly have had supermarket a products that were better.\n\nI will continue to be a fan of their breads and pastries but will stay away from the back section"

The ham and cheese on their really good croissant was also tasty- best thing hands down was the Croque Madame- crispy, creamy, cheesy, salty, literally good to the last bite. It was also basically self-serve, but the counter people were helpful, friendly and prompt.\n\n  Now to dessert. Were we just not hungry enough? We scoped the case on the way in and didn't know how we would ever narrow our choices. The pastries on display were both huge and beautiful. We finally settled on the lemon flan,strawberry tart, and mille-feuille.  They were huge and beautiful. Too bad they didn't taste better. Of the three, the mille-feuille was the best. It was layers of light, crispy pastry with whipped cream filling and strawberries. Sounds great. Looked great. The lady at the counter said it traditionally comes with a chocolate coating. Put it back. It needs the flavor. The tart was OK- crust was nice and it's hard to mess up strawberries, but the layer of pastry cream was just yucky. Same as the lemon flan. It was a huge portion, but we were expecting something smooth, light and creamy, like Mexican flan. It was heavy, chalky, and grainy. Even our resident human garbage disposal couldn't finish it. Or didn't want to. Who knew Mexicans were superior to the French as pastry chefs? \n\nTo add insult to injury,my niece reported that the counterperson at the bakery was less than gracious; Ok, rude. Not to be deterred, we decided to order a few things to go, so I was prepped to be nasty right back, but she decided to behave with me and no blood was shed.\n\n We had a lot better luck with the product, too. Salted caramel macarons were so tasty, as was the crispy coconut macaroon,and  the croissants (plain and almond). Will definitely go back, but will approach the pastry counter with caution."

It wasn't the best tomato soup I've had, but it was very tasty. \n\nI then finished my order with getting 1 and 2 of most of their macaroons. I'd say my favorites are the raspberry, salted caramel and the cafe but that's about it, the rest were just okay. I'm a bit bummed about them also being out of tiramisu, but I guess that would be a good excuse to come back.\n\nConcerning the customer service is wasn't the best I've encountered, but it wasn't the worst and I'd say it can use some improvement. As for the prices I'd say they are more than fair and I look forward to coming back and exploring more tasty treats.\n\nMy main recommendation on this place is that if you're wanting the very best of what they have to offer you will need to get here in the mornings or at least before 12pm."

All were chewy on the outside, creamy on the inside and bursting with intense, fresh flavors. Although I love them all, try the salted caramel macarons, they are magical. Until Manon, I always went all the way from my home in North Las Vegas, to Bouchon in the Venetian for my pastries.\n\nOne day for lunch, I had Manon's special, which for me was the French onion soup and the goat cheese quiche. The soup was delicious and the quiche was delicate and tender. I bought an almond croissant to take home. It was one of the best I'd ever tasted.

We walked in at 8:30pm, and although they closed at 9 and the cashier looked tired, she was still very friendly. \n\nSo the other day I was watching a Food Network baking challenge and the item they were making was macarons. I learned how they are made, and that the little crust underneath each one is actually called \"feet.\" FYI it's not a good macaron if it doesn't have feet. Ever since then I have had an intense craving for these bite size treats. Manon had a variety of flavors to chose from-with feet, at $1.25 a pop. I chose salted caramel, chocolate, pistachio, mango, peanut butter, and strawberry. The salted caramel was amazing, followed by the strawberry. They were all good, but those were my favorite. \n\nI couldn't stop eyeing the delicious cakes and danishes that were on display. The cakes looked really amazing. They also have savory items as well; fresh bread, quiche, and croque monsieur to name a few. French onion soup looks divine and I plan on coming back to try that and some other items, definitely a little earlier next time."

I liked the salted caramel the best.  We also shared a chocolate croissant, which was pretty good.  My wife loved it.  I thought is was just okay, but I like rich desserts and the chocolate croissant is not meant to be rich.  They had so many other great looking pastries that we did not try: flan, cake, eclairs, etc.  The regular food items were okay, but not great.  We shared a bowl of French onion soup.  Flavor was good, but I prefer loads of cheese and they added very little.  We tasted our friend's spinach and goat cheese quiche.  I think it was under cooked because it was runny.  Perhaps I just don't know French food.  Another friend had a lamb sausage sandwich. The portions were huge.  I thought it was two sandwiches.  The smothered the sandwiches with Frend fries.  (Do the French call them French fries, or just fried potatoes?)  The sausages were tiny.  I'd guess the width of my pinky finger.  I can't wait to go back and try more pastries."

I like the fact that the sandwich bread was baked at the same location) and it was filling and wholesome, a good value.

Alas, I just had to contend, for the moment, with my wonderful experience at Patisserie Manon as a substitute.  Ah well, c'est la vie!\n\nA friend and I decided to venture to this location, which is located quite a trek from the Las Vegas strip.  And though we did take a wrong turn here and there, we finally made it to this French bakery in the middle of the desert.\n\nThe pastry showcase is just a plethora of sweetness.  Glucose levels will rise surely just by the mere stare of the variety of pastries and macarons on display.  I admit I wanted mostly everything that morning, but I figured I had to settle for just one thing as there were many places yet to visit on this recent Vegas foodie adventure.\n\nAfter finally making a decision, I chose the strawberry cream pie.  Now of course, this does NOT resemble any version of American \"pie.\"  Sandwiched between two flaky layers of croissant-like texture are sliced strawberries and whip cream, while the entire pie is finished off with powered sugar, MORE whip cream, and a whole strawberry.  The entire pastry was simply divine.  The BEST way to start the morning paired with a cup of coffee.   I was reminded of that cafe scene in \"Inglorious Basterds\" where Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent are having coffee and pastries.  More so for the pastry they ordered, with the topping of whip cream, and the flaky crust of the pastry itself.  \n\nBefore leaving we took an assortment of macarons to go.  My favorite was the salted caramel.  There were any flavors, but truly that was the most memorable.....and the blueberry, of course.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  A wonderful experience at Patisserie Manon.  Bon App\u00e9tit!!"

Most of the their meals and sandwiches are decently priced. \n\nTheir coffee is NOT good and definitely needs work in that department. For a french bakery, they shouldn't just have coffee sittin in a pot. \n\nThey don't have selection of flavors and they use the Torani syrups. When I've gone, \"sometimes\" they have iced lattes sometimes they don't. That department is definitely lacking. \n\nI was happy to go there before Thanksgiving to grab some treats and I saw that they took orders for pies. A 16\" pie only cost $12 whereas a 12\" was only $9.  \n\n I ordered their cinnamon apple pie and it was BOMB. I took it to my parents house and EVERYONE loved it and it was really good with vanilla bean ice cream. \n\nThe crust on the pie was like a flaky crust much like the crosses that were on the pie (it's kind of hard to explain w/o a picture) and the glaze wasn't overbearingly sweet. It was the perfect amount of sweet. \n\nAnyways, I highly recommend this place. Not ripping you off and good quality. \n \nOnly 4 stars (would have had a 5 if coffee/espresso department was on point)"

This place is decorated with all sorts of illustrations that slowly acclimate your brain into believing that you're in some small village of France. \n\nI visited here with my boyfriend's family for Mother's Day. As soon as I walked in, I was taken aback by the beautiful array of desserts. So many to choose from, and they were gorgeous! After making my way through to the back, we ordered breakfast platters and omelets (which is served all day long, don't let the blackboard fool you!).  Personally, their breakfast menu is very similar to a breakfast platter with eggs and meat and a side of toast at any other restaurant that serves breakfast. However, I do have to say that their croissant is freshly baked and yummy AND their bacon is pretty damn good, too. Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to explore the rest of their large variety of other food options so I'll have to go back.\n\nI must say that the only reason for this 4 star review is because we had to wait a long while in order for everyone to even receive the drinks. My party also received our orders in different times so there was a small chaos brewing in the beginning of our breakfast. \n\nThe desserts on the other hand was AMAZING. I had the salted caramel and vanilla macarons and they were delicious! I ended up buying one of each flavor for my best friend to try and she loved them all. I also had the profiteroles and they were by far the best I've tasted. It was filled with custard and topped with chocolate and whipped cream. I'll be going back every week to pick up one of those for me. :) Other people in my party had more fruity pastries and they did mention that they had too much fruit in them but I think it may be the French or Manon style of baking so... to each his own. \n\nOverall, the food is to be determined but desserts are a must try!"

Frenchies get a bad rep.  The lady helping me had moved to Vegas from Paris just 3 months prior, and her English is very good.  I saw things I would eat in one of those virtual reality machines - napoleons, croissants, tarts....and was certainly impressed with the sheer size of the place - it was huge in the back and served savory goods too!\n\nYet the mission was for macarons, and I could not believe the endless flavors and colors available.  Miss Parisienne seemed amused that I did not want chocolate or peanut butter, but I got lemon and vanilla for myself, and a blueberry for the boy.  I told her that my mom and grandma are also Parisienne, that I got screwed as a child and was not taught French because it is their secret language, and shared with her the names of my uncles - all very French, though they grew up in Omaha.\n\nNeedless to say, when I got to my car, I ate the lemon one, and some of me went to pastry-heaven, so I ate the vanilla one.  I traveled carefully back to the SE side so Eric could have a little taste of France too, and he definitely was pleased with the results.\n\nI sent a picture to my Frenchie mom, and even though she could make them and definitely find them in her city, she wants me to bring some of Manon's when I visit next.

I assumed since I did not see the pale white yumminess that is vanilla, they were always out every time I went (I usually get there late in the afternoon.) Now it is a half dozen every single visit. They are light and creamy but at the same time have a delicate crunch. I'm salivating thinking about them.\n\nAlso, I never did update about the brioche and apple chaussons. The brioche was pretty standard for a French bakery. The apple chaussons are excellent. These are also a must buy every visit. The pastry is firm, buttery and glazed with a perfect sugar crust. The apples are not too sweet and have a pleasant texture. Not cooked down too much but not too firm either. \n\nMy mom liked the chocolate eclair I got for her, but she said it was a bit too sweet. Since then I have also gotten her a strawberry tart which she said was fabulous, but I think the winner was the apple tart. Upon tasting it, she said, \"Anytime you go back you can get me another one of these.\" I got a blueberry tart for my bf (which he shared) and I have to say it was delightful. The fruit was soft but not squishy and the pastry was buttery and flaky with not a single bit of sogginess.\n\nNow I love chocolate, but the chocolate truffle cake is definitely for chocolate fanatics or very patient people who can stand to eat something a couple bites at a time. It was very rich, very chocolaty and very hard to finish. The Black Forest was far tastier in my opinion. Just the right amount of chocolate and a nice cherry flavor. However, the fraiser cake is still my favorite.\n\nStill haven't tried any of the savory selections except for the quiche. I will have to remedy that soon as the ham and cheese croissant in one of the other Yelpers pictures keeps beckoning to me."

Good, although certainly not great, the almond croissant was one saving grace for the lot and I'd gladly return to enjoy one fresh/warm/fluffy at a later date to better assess as the shell was appropriately crisp, the frangipane thin and not overly sweet, and butter tones ample...but at the same time, why travel so far off strip when both Bouchon and Payard are more than capable of delivering a superlative croissant without leaving the hotel?"

BUT I've been wanting to try them for a while though because they look so darn pretty and I have had Patisserie Manon bookmarked but just haven't gotten around to going there. \n\nThis morning the doctor I was working with was really craving some sweets so I went to go pick us up some goodies from PM.. When you walk in you are hit with a delicious aroma and a bunch of beautiful pastries.. Towards the back they have their little bistro for sandwiches and hot dishes with booths to sit at (definitely coming back for lunch with the bf... he loved the movie Ratatouille LOL..)\n\nThe girl who helped me was patient & helpful while I checked out some stuff and she actually picked out the macaron flavors for me.. We got chocolate, vanilla, pistachio and salted caramel.. We also got an almond chocolate croissant.. The total came to $7.25 before tip.. NICE~!!!\n\nWhen I got back to the office.. I was debating on if I should try them or not because I'm watching what I eat..  But I just had to have at least one little bite of everything haha.. OMG Everyone who has ever told me that macarons are over rated is WRONG!!! They taste like chewy cookies with a nice little crunch and gooey center... yummmmm All of them were good but Chocolate and Salted Caramel stood out.. I will be back just for the SALTED CARAMEL!!! Perfect balance of flavors. WOW.. and I'm not going to lie I actually had TWO little bites of just the salted caramel LOL... I also love the fact that the macarons come in mini sizes.. The almond chocolate croissant was good too. Really moist and buttery in the middle. \n\nAny who, too bad I'm trying to be healthier otherwise I would be coming here A LOT!!! Boooooo but hey.. we're all allowed to have cheat days every now and then right??? haha \n\nHOT TIP: The lady at the counter told me they are always changing their bistro menu so that means more yummy nom noms to try~!!!"

Well Patisserie Manon, you managed to combine both of these into one easy pitstop.\n\nFor my first day back in town, my brother and I stopped by after a dinner nearby. Considering I had been obsessing over macarons for the past six months, it was evident we must get as many as possible to justify our journey across town. We picked up Ginger, Raspberry, Peanut Butter and Blueberry at a dollar apiece. Also, my brother had heard about the Tropezienne cake from a few of his Yelp friends, so that was clearly a necessity. \n\nThe macarons. Oh god, I thought I found perfection in Seattle...but I was wrong. So wrong. These are the epitome of what a macaron should be - airlike but with crunch; chewy yet fluffy. These blew the ones I picked up in Seattle out of the water - the Ginger flavor being the clear standout.\n\nAs for the Tropizienne, I had never heard about it before. But after one bite, I sure as hell know what it is now. Layers of brioche soaked in a simple syrup with butter cream and peaches in between - seriously, how could you not love it? This mentality was clearly adopted between David S. and myself as we barehandedly devoured half of it in the parking lot - quite a barbaric sight if I'd ever seen one. The best part? A large (think the size of your head) piece was only $4.35. Thank goodness for the sizable distance between my house and Patisserie Manon - otherwise, my waistline might just hate my guts."

I guess, it's actually a good thing it's not, or i would be going there almost every day. \n\nAside from the most recent time I went, service has always been great. Always friendly. Never too long of a wait for food. \n\nMan, their quiches are so damn good. I get so angry at them every time I eat one of their quiches because mine just never quite measure up. i don't know how they get them so perfect every time. From the crust to the filling, everything is just so damn tasty. I will say though, the only one I've tried that I haven't been a big fan of is their chili one. I didn't quite like the how the quiche was kind of liquidy because o the chili. They do have a quiche special, where you get a quiche, soup or salad, and drink for only $8.95.\n\nCassoulet & Beef bourbignon are also two things that should be checked out. The cassoulet [ i do hope I'm spelling that right], is mainly pork, with sausage, bacon, and white beans served with a couple pieces of bread. The beef bourbignon consists of beef [duh] , carrots, onions, and pasta also served with a couple pieces of bread. You get this cute little pot full, all for 9.95 ! \n\nthey have so many pastries there, it's ridiculous. I've only tried a handful of things myself, but most of it was pretty good. I was a little disappointed by their eclairs, but that was no biggie. \n\nAll in all, a great place to go. I'll never get tired of eating their quiches."

(In a French accent).\n\n\nI walked in for a relaxing Sunday lunch to find a good number of patrons, smiling staff, and the sugary/buttery aromas you'd hope to find in a good bakery.  The display cases are illuminated with a plethora of divinely colorful cakes and pastries; it really does feel like being a little kid again.  You might want to wear sunglasses, to hide the fact that your pupils are dialated like the people in Soundgarden's \"Black Hole Sun\" video.  (Is 90's Grunge fair to reference anymore?)\n\nI came in with a book, and appetite, and high expectations.  The only thing that didn't get accomplished was the book part, since I was too involved with my food, and you can't eat a book.  Here are the specifics of my order:\n\nCup of Tomato Soup - Light and flavorful, served with two pieces of fresh baked French bread, perfect for dipping.  I enjoyed this soup, which wasn't as garlicy and basily as some Italian versions would be, but still contained subtle nuances of herbs alongside the tomato goodness. \n\nBacon and Spinach Quiche - My favorite part of a quiche is the flaky, yet crispy crust on the outside.  This quiche was incredibly light and fluffy, which is exactly what many quiche lovers look forward to experiencing.  I found it too light, and lacking texture.  The flavor was nice, with the rich bacon coming through in every bite, but I wouldn't order it again. \n\nMacarons :\nSalt Caramel and Butter - Rich, lovely, and perfectly divine.  I must say this is one of the best tasting macarons you'll find.  \n\nLemon - Also quite good, the lemon curd in the middle was bright and refreshing.\n\nPistachio - Very good as well, however the Salt Caramel and Butter stole the show here.  I would highly recommend having at least two of those. \n\n\nNo pretense here, just well baked food for everyone, regardless of whether you call them \"Macaroons,\" or \"Macarons.\"\n\n-Adieu"

I tried this bakery again and sampled a range of their baked items and also a deli sandwich (the croque monsieur)  I had truly hoped I would be able to give four stars or more this time, but it still did not meet my expectations.  That is too bad because I really REALLY have wanted to like this place.  It's in a great location (away from the noise and congestion of the Strip), making it a wonderful \"locals\" destination.  The interior is very nice, divided into bakery and a pleasant area in the deli for sit-down dining.  The baked goods look divine.  But once again, the items I tried failed the taste test, at least for me.  \n\n1. Croque Monsieur - they've raised the price on various items.  This is now $6.95 (had been $5.95).  I liked the bread it's made with - nice and crunchy.  But the ham had no flavor.  It could have been anything. If I closed my eyes, I wouldn't know what I was eating.  The cheese was okay, although it turned rubbery after a few minutes.  So, it was just \"meh\".  Wouldn't order it again, certainly not at 6.95.\n\n2.  Bakery items - tried two flavors of macaroons - salted caramel and coffee.  The prices on macaroons have also gone up, are now $1.25, up from $1.10.  The good news is, they are so rich, one or two is sufficient.  I found them to be overly sweet.  The salted caramel was sooo sweet it put my teeth on edge, and the coffee flavored one was just okay.  Perhaps there's a flavor there that I would like better, but those were not my faves.\nMore bakery items tried:  the almond tart/pastry...did NOT like the flavor on this at all.  At over $3.00, it was disappointing.  I was expecting a rich marzipan flavor as is the norm for almond pastries, but the flavor was \"off\"....can't put my finger on it, but just did not like it.  I wanted to like it, but did not. Chocolate croissant:  I usually like even the most lackluster chocolate croissant because what's not to like, right?  But amazingly, I did NOT like theirs. That's a first for me, not liking a chocolate croissant!   Perhaps I didn't like the type of chocolate they used, and the pastry itself wasn't flaky enough.  Bummer!  If I can't like a chocolate croissant, it's pretty disappointing. Also sampled their choux pastry - it's like a big cream puff with a lot of choux paste.  Usually, choux paste like this has a rich, vanilla flavor. Theirs was so mild, it hardly had any taste at all.  It was like eating......nothing.  I couldn't really detect much flavor at all  in that choux filling.   Again, perhaps this is their style and it's me?  I'm always willing to admit that perhaps a particular style of flavor or baking is not their fault, but mine.  Nevertheless, I still want to eat what pleases ME first.  \n\nThe bottom line is that I have pretty much given up on this bakery, although I MAY try one more time, just to make sure there's absolutely nothing there that rocks my world.  Again, I really like this place due to its location, which works for me and I also like to take out of town relatives to places that are OFF the Strip where it's quieter and more \"locals\" oriented.  I guess the message here is:  perhaps third time's the charm?  Let's hope so!  or it will be \"au revoir!\"     ."

This dish goes very well with any flower flavor or white tea such as rose tea, jasmine or light green tea.   \n\nLemon Tart/Mixed Berry Tart/Strawberry Tart//Blueberry Tart\n 3/5 sweetness\nThe fruit tart has a fruity aroma with moose-like creamy texture to it. The lemon tart does not have tangy sour after taste.  It is balance just right between the sweet and the sourness.  The mixed berry tart occasionally can have a little sourness, the sugar glaze compliment very well with that berry sourness.   If you don't enjoy sour fragrance in tarts.  Blueberry tart is a good choice.  The shortbread cookie crust brings a very good balance to all fruit base tart.  Compares to the sweetness, the tarts is a sweeter than the strawberry cake.  It is a very refreshing dish and goes very well with dark tea such Earl grey or english breakfast tea.  \n\nChocolate Tart \n4/5 sweetness\nAny one who loves dark chocolate and shortbread cookie should try this dish.   The rich creamy dark chocolate custard rest smoothly on top of the shortbread cookie tartshell.  It screams chocolate all over.  My recommendation of the drink would be coffee preferably black."

It was the tiramisu cake - and was a little disappointed that the cake to cream ratio was off.  Too much cream - we threw away most of it since it was mostly cream and shaved chocolate. The flavor was delicate but would not order it again.  I happened to notice they had fresh baked bread when I picked up the cake - and THAT was outstanding!  LOVE the bread - what a total win by accident for my group.  Coming from the NYC city area and used to high priced items - I was surprised at the price of macarons - 1.50+$ each and the size of a quarter.  I decided not to try one out of principle alone.  They are too far out of the way to get that kind of money for such a tiny pastry.  Overall very pricey in my opinion."

Eclairs, to creme brulees, to their famous strawberry cake and Black Forest cake, to my most favorite part.. THEIR MACAROONS. Seriously the BEST macaroons I have tasted! Perfect amount of crisp 'poof' to the outside shells and just amount of creamy center, with a variety of flavors to choose from -- favorites are salted caramel and butter salted caramel. They sell them at $1 each and allow you to sample one flavor for free. I've also purchased their strawberry cake from them and definitely something I'll be getting for any upcoming birthdays, including my own. I have yet to try their Black Forest and white chocolate Black Forest since I've been told is another top seller. \n\nI've also dined in for lunch, but their food selection didn't excite me as much as the bakery and pastries part of the restaurant did. I went with the creamy spinach soup and it was just OK. I'd return to try out their quiches though and their prices are pretty reasonable considering the portions they serve."

We placed our order, only to get told 5 minutes later that they were out of bread to make the sandwiches.  Then we got told that they weren't out of bread, but that the bread was frozen, which was even more disturbing. Isn't the bread fresh baked? Why is it frozen?  WTH?  How can a bakery/patisserie be out of bread?!?! My husband ordered a latte, but was told that the machine was broken.  Despite these issues, we ordered quiches - Lorraine and Mushroom & Bacon.  They were brought to our table 10 minutes later with 3 pieces of lettuce each which we think were supposed to be side salads but looked like a weak attempt at a garnish.  When we asked which quiche was which, she couldn't tell us. The quiches were warm at best and the consistency was mushy and the crust was wet, signs of being overly microwaved. The taste of both quiches was bland, no flavor at all. All in all, a disappointing experience. We really wanted to like this place, unfortunately, it was a huge miss.  The search continues ......."

If you've ever visited or lived in a European city, you may understand my love for the smell of fresh bread when entering a store.  This place has it!!!\n\nI used to come just for the macarons.  They're a bit more edgy in attitude compared to the classic and elegant shape we all know of.  Also, they look so great bunched together and boxed up for gifts.  Best of all, the taste and texture is perfect - just like the rest of the pastries they offer.\n\nNow, I come for the dough.  I pick up fresh bread in the mornings and could not be happier with the similar taste of my former home abroad.  Don't forget about the croissants!  Whenever I have visitors in town, I pick up both chocolate and almond croissants for breakfast or tea/coffee time.  The plain is great too, but the almond is one not to leave behind - trust me.  \n\nCakes.  I am so impressed with the price point for these cakes, considering their light and smooth satisfying taste as well as beautiful presentation.  If you're not looking for a cake-based celebration cake, and more of a mousse or something fruity... these are just right!  The tiramisu one is pretty delightful too.  They even have some available for you to just pick up and add a chocolate happy birthday sign if you're looking for something last minute.\n\nClearly, I love this place, and I'm sure you will too.\nPs. some of the employees are foreignly cute as well ;P"

I've seen many people spend their afternoons here reading or studying. \n\nI came in to order two celebration cakes for work and expected to take home two frozen cakes. However, I was told I could put in an order for two fresh cakes (to be picked up about 12 hours later) that would be ready in time for the next morning. Apparently their bakers and pastry chefs come in around 2-3AM and get going on all the fresh items including cakes. I was able to come in and pick up my 2 eight inch Strawberry Truffle (custom) and black forest cakes at 8am the day after I ordered. They don't box and write on your cake until you get there so it's ready without sitting out. The greeting comes written on a piece of meringue to place on the cakes. Both cakes (to serve about 20-25 people) cost $64. They're gorgeous and they taste beautiful as well. \n\nMy coworkers LOVE the Framboisier.. it is very light and the raspberries cut through the sweetness perfectly. We have all had our fair life experiences with Vegas cakes and they all agreed that this was the best cake they have had in their lives. The truffle was great also.. definitely more rich so a slice can last you a whole afternoon.\n\nWhile some things can be a little pricey, you'll enjoy what you buy."

Their macarons are mishmashed together and piled high (which should have been the first clue), but I optimistically anticipated that what was lacking in beauty would be made up for in flavor.  Didn't happen.  *Sigh*  These were heavy, doughy cookie sandwiches with creme middles that were too sugary and very sadly flavored.  A chewy disappointing lesson learned at $1.10 each.  Even if I had no knowledge of what a true macaron should look and taste like, their version would still not pass for a Parisien delicacy.  Fortunately, service was pleasant, the decor a bit eclectic (which I like), and the bistro had some nice lunch offerings.  The French onion soup was okay--served steaming hot, with a stringy gruyere cheese topping, sweet caramelized onions and came with generous slices of baguette.

It came in a nice pot though and looked promising.  It was sour because they used bad wine.  They didn't cook the beef right and it was stringy and tough.  I did like the quiche.  The quiche was light and fluffy and we got to take some home.   \n\nThe black forest cake that we got was very pedestrian.  I can make it at home with store bought stuff.  But one slice was bigger than my kid's head.  :)"

Definitely awarding the 5 star here - always top-notch service, always top-notch food, and always a great experience, whether you're dining in or taking something home.\n\nFor one, the croissant is still simply the best croissant I have ever had, and if that is as good as a croissant gets then I have no reason to complain, either. This is definitely a croissant you'd want to try on its own first, to appreciate how wonderful and flaky and buttery it really is. It feels like a work of art... the croissant that haunts my dreams when I go too long without it and must subsist, reluctantly, on the doughy-hard-chewy pseudo-croissants from the groceries.\n\nAnd after you've tried The Croissant On Its Own, it's also worth trying the croissant sandwiches, for a different take. They're another class, but they're so good... I always deeply appreciate a sandwich that doesn't sink miserably into the excess cheese, and the ratios they use here make such a good, basic croissant sandwich...\n\nFor two, the other pastries are still excellent, especially for the price point. It really is difficult to beat the pricing of these compared to value; they're such great pieces that could easily demand a higher price. Thank goodness they don't; the one-dollar macaron is just so appealing. I think the clear best is the salted caramel, by the way.\n\nFor three, the staff is just so personable and friendly. They have excellent in-house communication, which is critical since they have different stations for different foods, and there's a lot of dine-in and take-out distinctions. But they're all very, very good, and they take the time to give you some fun and useful information too, like recommendations, and how the patisserie closes in July for Bastille Day celebrations back home in France. \n\nNeedless to say, I have been returning here, happier and happier each time to have Patisserie Manon in the neighborhood."

That saved me time and probably quite a few trips up and down Charleston to find this gem of a shop.\n\nWhen you walk in you'll probably be sucked in by their display of sweet treats. Yeah, they all look delicious. But once you get past that, you'll see a counter and display of some of their savory options. I opted for a simple ham and swiss on a baguette (about 7 bucks). It's made to order and is quite large -- at least a foot if not more. For the price and size, I think it's a good lunch time bargain. The only negative is that the bread was a little too hard for my tastes. Instead of it being crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, it was just hard all around.\n\nOn my way out I just couldn't resist the macarons ($1 each). My mind was saying no, but my stomach was saying, \"hell yes!\" I figured a little treat couldn't hurt so I got six of them (pistachio, chocolate, lemon, chocolate mint, blueberry, vanilla). All were delicious with a light and crunchy shell and soft, creamy center. But, the standouts were the pistachio and chocolate mint.\n\nI'll be back to try more of their savory dishes, but I'm sure I'll walk out with a few more macarons or pastries as well."

Manon is privately-owned where the food is the star and not the name on the store-front. Chef Jean-Paul and his wife Rachel are the owners of Manon which they named after one of their daughters. And I consider this place to be one of the best French p\u00e2tisseries outside of France.\n\nMACARONS: At the heart of every French bakery lies a macaron. As soon as you enter the store, you're greeted by a case filled with mountains of colorful confectioneries. No matter what flavors you choose, each macaron will be identical in size with a flawless finish. And no complaints here on cookie:filling ratio. At $1 a pop, they're a steal! A fraction of the cost of Ladur\u00e9e, more accessible, and equal in taste. \n\nSAVORY: You can keep it under $10! If I worked in the area, I'd probably be here everyday for lunch. There's a sweet lunch combo: soup, sandwich, drink all for $9. But offering to buy me me a spinach or escargot quiche (yeah, I said snails) would be an easy way to get me on a date.\n\nEverything is so delicious, I need more excuses to eat at Manon! If you'd like to try, Manon is located in the Roy's/Fleming's shopping center across from Boca Park."

I think this place is going a bit downhill, or cleanliness standards or other standard operating procedure is going by the way side. My soup and quiche were warm but not hot when served to me, I should have sent it back but didn't. But this isn't what the real issue was. This is a family run business, and two teenage girls kept going from the real kitchen in back to the sandwich/quiche ordering/prep area. One was redoing her pony tail (while chatting with the gals that work that area) where the food was being prepared. That's unacceptable. I get that this is their family's restaurant but that's totally unsanitary-she did it at least 2 different times when I was eating my food which was literally prepared inches away. I also noticed that they cut food on the prep boards, but placed others commercial items (as they needed to use them) on the same board (box of food wrap, and a salad spinner), these are not sanitary, or considered clean, and raw food like lettuce and tomatoes were being cut there. And the lettuce was put in spinner, but tomatoes just placed on directly on customers plates for serving (surplus placed in bin).\n\nTwo last things that made me think I can no longer patronize this place. A young girl (customer there with her mom) returned a carry out container and asked for a smaller one (her mom said that's too big, get a smaller one). She was touching the inside of the container (I mean she's a kid). The girls took it back, placed it with the other \"clean/unused\" ones. Yikes, that's not right, just throw it out, and give her the smaller container.\n\nLastly, there was a young man working for Patisserie Manon. He was on break, just had lunch, finished, and walked to back kitchen (for a min to probably clock back in) and went to front counter to help customers. No hand washing, just ate his sandwich, etc with his hands and starting touching carry out items/helping customers. Another yikes!\n\nI am 100% behind supporting small businesses, but did I have a stomach ache all night. Yes, likely because what I ate was ridden with various bacteria. Luckily, did not get full blown food poisoning."

I'll break it down pastry by  pastry :)\nFraisier cake- strawberries, almonds, whipped cream, and white cake. My fall back fave!! I literally dream about this cake! \n\nCocunut cake- yuuuuuum this cake is great it's not super sweet and has a nice light coconut flavor. \n\nCoffee cake- as in coffee flavored cake, not the coffee crumb cake you might think of. The coffee flavor is really good, it comes through with being bitter or too sweet for that matter. \n\nTiramisu- my hubbies favorite all time dessert, a clear miss here at manon. It was rather bland and didn't have the in depth espresso flavor or exceptionally creamy mascarpone layer you look for in a delish tiramisu. Hubby ate it but will never order it again. \n\nLemon cake- I thought I would love this!! I'm a lemon lover, but there was something off about the flavor of this cake. I wanna say it was almost a fake lemon flavor :( if it had been a tart lemon curd instead of the bitter fake lemon cream stuff it would have probably been awesome.\n\nChocolate raspberry- okay I am NOT a fan of their chocolate cake. It's no where near the perfect texture of their white cake!! It also needed more raspberries IMO.\n\nMacarons- I've tried most of the flavors the clear stand outs are the pistachio, salted butter caramel, and ginger. The ginger one has a crystallized ginger filling that has just the right spice! \n\nI see a lot of reviews on here claiming the service is not great. But as many times as I've been in here I can't understand why?? I've NEVER had a problem and I've gone at almost closing time. If anything the girls always swoon over my son and daughter! One time they didn't have the salted butter caramel macaron up front so she went in the back to search for them for me, all for 5 macarons! My star deduction is for those few cakes I didn't care for. They were just not for me, they obviously sell the hell out of them so it's a question of taste for sure :)\n\nOkay so I wrote this review on a Sunday night and was TOTALLY in the mood for some macarons on Monday so I went and the smart woman I am I was checking in on yelp and walking to the door...THEY'RE CLOSED ON MONDAYS :("

These are some of the best tasting macarons that I've had in the city. The flavors are not crazy or too fancy, but they have a bunch of really delicious flavors. It would be fun for return customers if they tried new flavors every once in a while, but they seem to be doing what they know how to do very well.\n\nMy husband and I have tried a wide variety of their baked goods: tarts, flan, macarons, croissants, cake, etc. We have yet to be disappointed. The baked goods are on the pricier side, but they are really delicious.\n\nWe've also tried their little cafe in the back. Their sandwiches are also pricier (and you're not going to get ridiculous portion sizes) but are seriously good. Their coffee is not bad!\n\nThe only downside to this place is that the decor inside seems kind of weird and disjointed, it doesn't have the greatest atmosphere. There are lots of coolers near the eating area for the bakery and there can be a lot of white noise.\n\nFavorites: Caramel flan, any flavor macaron, Croque Madame."

The prices are reasonable (approximately $4.50 for a gigantic slice of cake) and the portion size, at least of pastry is huge.  I have been here about three times now, the most recent being yesterday where I finally tried the La Parisian (brie, ham and pickles on a baguette), the lunch special including a small bowl of soup and a small salad and a drink was about $10. The sandwich was what was to be expected although I would have preferred them to have melted the brie. My friend said that they have melted it before when she went there.  We also split a quiche Lorraine. The quiche was phenomenal, a very light and custardy texture, not overcooked or dense with great flavor. The best quiche I have had thus far. \n\nAs for the pastries, where do I start? My favorite so far has been the coffee eclair, and I am not a big eclair person but it was perfectly baked and the coffee filling was not too sweet. Also had the chocolate cake which was great too. The chocolate croissant (my standard for any bakery) was authentic and reminiscent of the other french bakery I like The Baguette Cafe (although Patisserie Manon is much larger with much more variety, The Baguette Cafe is more of a lunch spot than a bakery). They have a varied selection of macaroon and for a macaroon they are quite good although I will admit I am not a huge macaroon fan. \n\nMy mom came before and bought the flan, she was quite happy with it, granted she doesn't eat much so wherein I would have inhaled it in a night she took a week to eat it - which I guess goes to show how big their portions are. \n\nThe cashier recommended a cake, which for some reason I can't remember the name of but it had a toblerone filling (I think it was called the Tobey but I am not sure) - I simply must try that one that next time I can justify going here!"

            "review": "Patisserie manon is an absolute must when you're in the Boca Park area of Summerlin! What originally attracted me here years ago was my fervent hunt for macarons. What's not to like about macarons? They are cute, colorful, and sweet! I was a little skeptical when I first saw the macarons here because...well they looked awkward. They were chubby and lop-sided, but you know what? That saying \"It's what's inside that counts\" couldn't be more true. \n\nWhen you first walk in, you instantly see the case of macarons, tarts, eclairs and other delectable sweets screaming eat me! Next, are the full sized cakes. Further along, are baked goods like croissants and breads. Even further back, you can order more savory items like quiches and sandwiches. \n\nAfter multiple cake orders, dozens and dozens of macarons later, baby showers, birthday parties, girls nights out, and even just because moments...Patisserie manon has never ceased to amaze me. Their cakes are show stoppers and people can't stop popping these macarons in their mouth. Every party, someone will ask \"Oh, where is this from?\" \n\nSome of my favorite items:\nMacarons:\n- Caramel w/ salted butter\n- Coffee\n- Chocolate \n\nCake:\n- Frazier/fraisier (sp?) (white cake w/ fresh strawberries and topped with macarons) \n\nDesserts:\n- All eclairs (vanilla, chocolate, and coffee) \n\nPersonally, I think everything is priced well. Macarons are $1...maybe a few cents more and cakes run $30-50. Customer service has always been decent and never had any problems with any orders.\n\nI would like to return and try the more savory items :)"

Deciding to give it another try, I had the same experience again. Tasted like a Costco croissant which are good, but not the flaky, crisp buttery outside and soft gooey inside it should be. The portions sizes of the desserts are huge and I brought home a typical European almond cake and we all agreed it was overly sweet without the nuance of a fine pastry. The cappuccino was mediocre as well, yet the service staff was very friendly and efficient."

We arrived around 8:30pm and they closed at 9pm.\n\nThe lady working behind the counter was friendly and greeted us right away.  We started to take a look at all the baked goods, there were all kinds of cakes, croissants and macarons in a rainbow of colors and flavors.  We decided to get one of each of the macarons, a coffee flavored eclair and a very rich and decadent chocolate cake (I forget the name of it) and two croissants, one regular and one with sausage (my boyfriend was disappointed it was a hot dog wiener not sausage) in the croissant.\n\nWe took our goods to go and when we got home dug into the cookies and cake.  The croissant was huge though, probably the largest I've ever seen or eaten!  And I would say the ginger macaron was not to my liking at all.\n\nSince it's on the other side of town from where we live, it may be a while before I go back but I do recommend this place!"

Service was slow, there was a person ahead of us who apparently had been waiting quite awhile and was asking if her food was ever going to come out, and there was an older Asian woman at the register that seemed confused and disorganized (maybe it was her first day?), we had to repeat our order twice, and then I saw she had to come back over to one of the tables after us to go over their order again.  Lots of unbussed tables that were still dirty when we left.\n\nI think the real star here is the desserts and pastries.  The cakes are HUGE and inexpensive.  The $1.10 macarons are wow good.  Just like any other macaron place, some flavors are better than others and I really loved the Caramel and Pistachio flavors.  These are twice the size of normal macarons, too.  I enjoyed these more than the macarons from Laduree and Pierre Herme!  I will be back for macarons and to try some cakes."

I'm assuming most of the other reviews are based on baked goods, unfortunately, all I can speak for is two soups and a croissant. Split pea was watery, flavorless, and had bits of bacon fat floating at the top. So I switched to seasonal pumpkin, which tasted like cardboard. Fresh pumpkin is great, but some can be bitter or watery and lack flavor. The chef did nothing to compensate, no salt even. The croissant could have easily been from Costco, which given the vats of pastry filling (long list of ingredients) I saw them use to fill a turnover, I wouldn't be surprised. They might look quaint, but that's not how they cook."

Lunch is very do-able here. A sandwich/panini/croissant/quiche paired with a soup or salad and a coffee drink for under $10! After gobbing your face with french delights, please make a beeline towards the highlight of all my experiences: the ginger macaron. Even if you're not a fan of the strong flavor of its root, you will be, please believe me. It's a beautiful medley of a spicy and sweet bite. It warms you up in all the right places. Now they may not look all even and the same because they are chubby and wonky which i think only adds to their charm and quirkiness, a trait i place on the tallest of macaron pedestals.\n\nI will most likely never say no to patisserie manon."

We had macaroons ($1.25 each), the Fraiser cake, the Mimosa cake, some sort of chocolate cake, a raspberry tart,  and a few other things, and they all were beautiful, fresh, and fantastic.\n\n The only thing that made this less than a perfect bakery experience was that while the service was friendly and sweet (haha), it was a little on the slow side.  I appreciated the packaging, but it seemed like our server had a bit of difficulty getting the items out of the display case.  So, if you are in a hurry, it is probably not going to be the speediest, but the quality and taste definitely makes up for it!"

I can't remember what it was called nor can I pronounce it, but it was a purple one with fruit. It was pricey for a 6 person serving, but it was heaven and worth it. They sell cake in individual slices and they're huge portions- enough for two. I'm waiting for the peanut butter cake to come back I always check to see if it's the bakery case.

I wanted a simple 8 person cake, white with red roses seemed simple enough. I did want different flavored cakes THAT THEY OFFERED and different flavored frostings. On my wedding day I ended up catching a cold and pushed back the ceremony an hour, they could not hold the cake, they WOULD NOT hold the cake a minute longer so we decided fine we'd pick it up & I was devastated. For as much money as we paid and as many people we told exactly what we wanted, for them to completely ignore everything and give me a plain vanilla cake with flowers that were literally in the box they gave it in ALREADY COMPLETELY FALLEN OFF.

The portion is quite large- pictured a halved garlic bread loaf, topped with about seven or eight escargot and a liberal blanket of cheese, broiled to order. Overall taste could use a smidge more seasoning- salt or pepper, maybe, would perk it up a tiny bit more. Taste was just a tiny bit unbalanced, but quite tasty.\n\nI was again a bit put off by a male employee- this one was in the rear of the store, and I ordered my escargot from him. It was in the case next to him, and I read the order title off of the signage in the window. In front of him.\nHis first reaction was a grimace, and then, \"Let me check and see if we have that.\" Then he crouched down and pulled out the tray, eyeing them apprehensively.\n\nHad my craving for escargot not been overwhelming, I likely would have cancelled my order and left.

But someone needs to have a chat with male staff for this company... see my review for other location for more info."

            "review": "The macarons from Patisserie Manon may not appear to be delicate or dainty like the ones I've tried from Bouchon, but they're much sweeter and their flavors are apparent. The lemon tastes like lemon. The strawberry tastes like strawberry. The schn...well, you get the point. Whenever I've tried macarons I've always been slightly dissatisfied because the flavors are subtle. I've never traveled to France and eaten a real French macaron before, so I'm unsure if the flavors are supposed to be light, but if I buy one that claims its raspberry flavored, well, it better taste like a raspberry.\n\nGETTIN' MY MAC ON\nI purchased 10 macarons, two of each of the following: cherry, raspberry, caramel sea salt, strawberry, and lemon. The cherry, strawberry, and the lemon are my favorites and the most flavorful. The raspberry and the caramel sea salt had lighter flavors, and I was expecting the caramel to be saltier. Just a bit more salt would've created a pleasant sweet and salty flavor. \n\nOVERALL\n$1 a macaron beats paying over $3.00 for one at Bouchon. There are also plenty of flavors. I came here originally for the macarons, and I'll come back for another box and perhaps try one of the ginormous pastries behind the counter that you cannot avoid staring at."

I was instantly drawn to the macaroon display. For $1 a piece, I ordered chocolate, peanut butter, salted caramel and coffee. All were extremely delicious. I noticed a few patrons eating very large portions of cake that looked extremely delicious. \n\nAlso I bought some bread to take home and try my hand at croque Monsieur which ended up being delicious!\n\nI wish I lived closer.

They probably have 12-15 different flavors of macarons! (rose, mango, salted caramel, lemon, blueberry, orange, ginger, peanut butter, coffee, pistachio, mint chocolate, and the list goes on....)  Okay, are these bad boys as good as the ones from Bouchon.... that's a resounding no, but they are only $1.10 each.  They aren't the prettiest macarons I've seen since they seem to be put together haphazardly, but they are still delicious little morsels.  They have tons of other cakes/pastries/meringues to choose from as well.  I didn't get a chance to sample their food, but they seem to have a good selection of sandwiches and comfort French food.

            "review": "It does not get better than this place, seriously.\n\nPatisserie Manon is located downstairs on the far left side of the building behind Flemings at Charleston and Ft. Apache. \n\nThe location is a bit diabolical as it is situated just beneath a few personal training studios - confronting someone with the option of delicious, beautiful French pastries right after an exhausting hour long workout just is NOT playing fair. \n\nThat said, it is equally delicious when you are not famished. It is set up in two parts, really. The front register is for the bakery case - there are a number of different pastries in the case - eclaires, macarons, slices of cake, croissants, tarts, and more. They are pretty reasonably priced (around $4 each) and perfect for a sweet treat to enjoy there or to go. \n\nYou can also purchase cakes at the front - their cake cooler is always worth a peek as they really do a gorgeous job with decorating. Lots of great colors and flourishes. These cakes are AH-mazing. My favorite is the Tobli cake. I bought it by accident once because it was the least expensive chocolate flavored cake in the case and I didn't want to spend the money on the more expensive truffle cake. It is called \"Tobli\" because it incorporates elements from the Toblerone Candy Bar - so chocolate and peanuts. There are crispy nougatey layers alternated with generous dollops of to die for chocolate cream filling, and dusted with more chocolate cream and peanuts.\n\nI've since bought this cake a few times for various occasions and everyone absolutely loves it. Additionally, I purchased two of their Bouches de Noel (Christmas Logs) which are \"rolled\" sponge cake filled with frosting and decorated really cutely with a \"log\" exterior and little woodland animals. Super cute and a perfect hostess gift for the holidays.\n\nThe back section of the restaurant is focused on the savory yumminess - breakfast is nice - they serve a few different egg dishes with their amazingly flaky and buttery croissants, along with delicious quiches (the salmon and vegetable quiche special I had once was surprisingly amazing) Their soups are also quite good and my husband always ordered the \"French Hotdog\", which was a hot dog sliced and served on baguette with bechamel sauce - super yummy. Warning: the hot dog itself is not very high quality, but the rest of the dish is good enough, and novel enough, that it is still okay. If you're having both a meal and dessert, you usually order your meal and your dessert from the separate areas, not all on one tab. \n\nThe staff are typically very nice - there are some who don't always come across as super friendly and there are occasionally waits, but I've honestly never had a bad experience there and anytime there is a wait, I can understand why (they have a lot of diners, or few employees, etc) \n\nThe drink selection is the one downfall - for example, they don't currently carry any orange juice (or a selection of other juices), which is a bit odd for a place that is open for breakfast. \n\nPrice: The pastries and savory food are a deal - very reasonable. The cakes are pretty expensive, but worth it in my opinion as they are unique, fresh, and delicious - your guests will talk about a cake from Manon for weeks. \n\nCake Tip: The \"servings\" listed on the cakes are pretty generous - a \"4 serving\" cake serves at least 6, a 6 serving cake probably serves 8-10 slices, etc. \n\nIn conclusion, if you have not been here, please go, it is great!"

I've never been that big of a fan because I've only had the kind that tasted grainy, too sweet and didn't taste the featured  flavor.\n\nBut here the macaroons are slightly larger, more delicate and airy, and oh so flavorful. I tried a couple... Just to taste, and my favorite one is the rose. It's a seasonal flavor ow but I hope they add to their regular offerings.\n\nIn addition! There's a new quiche in town. The crust is flaky, the egg filling is soft and creamy. I've had the mushroom goat cheese, vegetables, and mushroom, and onion, all were great. You won't go wrong with any of them."

First the ham and cheese croissant was excellent I was almost full by the time I finished it.   Then I started looking at desert,   this is where it really becomes tough to make a decision, they have so many different items to choose from and the all look tasty. \n\nso my first choice was the almond croissant that I had been reading about here on yelp.   Next I went with the peach/pear tart (I took all my desserts home for later)  next was the sausage croissant,  salted caramel, chocolate pistachio,  and cherry macaroons and lastly the citron tart.   I get home and immediately tear into a salted caramel macaroon which was mouth watering! \nOk I'm still film from earlier but decide to take a bite of the almond croissant and  must say I agree with everyone that has said try it,  because it was truly amazing.   I'm to full to stuff anything else in my mouth right now but do plan to finish off the rest and maybe go back next week to try some new items!  Hope this review helps :)"

The shop used to be a wine/cafe so it was interesting to see how they had changed it up. They have this cool candy wall, but I think its 6.00 a lb? Right away when you walk in, on your left is a fridge with cakes, truffles and macaroons....walk down a lil further and you will find croissants/rolls. If you walk down even further you will see there's a small cafe that will serve you coffee, tea, sandwiches, quiches, etc. I decided to get a chocolate croissant and an eclair to go. Before we left though, we decided to get the ham and chesse croissant. They heated it up and in about 5 minutes we had this yummy ham and cheese sandwich. I thought it was pretty delicious, but for 6 dollars a pop it might be a lil pricey. \n\nHow did everything else fair? The chocolate croissant was ok. The croissant wasn't very flaky and it wasn't the best chocolate croissant I've ever had. The eclair was pretty delicious though. I definitely liked the custard inside, not too sweet but perfect. Both items came out to be around $5.00. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed Patisserie Manon. I will be back to try one of their things in the cafe (ground beef and mashed potatoes!). I definitely recommend it to anyone with a sweet tooth or a not so sweet tooth."

I definitely ordered way too many of these and other assorted pastries, but they were so affordable! The patisserie didn't pretentiously overcharge for their goods like other bakeries to seem \"more French.\" I ended up buying so many that I couldn't finish them all.

Bought several quiches to go - Lorraine,ham and cheese,onion, mushroom with goat cheese - flan, and macarons. Been back several times last month just because it was close by Summerlin hosp where hubby's having a procedure done, but definitely worth the trip for that alone. Macarons were not as amazing as some of the reviews I've read claim. I got one of each flavor @ $1 each, which was about 11, I think. They were  ok. Baguettes were awesome both soft and crunchy. Yes, they have two kinds. Didn't know that. Btw, Croque monsieur was so yummy!!   Five stars all around!"

I had her drive from Henderson to Vegas, a 30 minute drive to pick this 8\" cake for herself and for her very food-critical French husband. She didn't mind the long drive since it was her first time seeing a strawberry cake loaded with macaroons.\n\nI was so nervous when I first placed the order as I've never had their cake nor stepped foot in this adorable french patisserie. I've called at least 10 times and each time it was almost a different person but everyone of them was so welcoming, very sincere - the best customer service I had ever experienced on the phone. I thought I was Charlie meeting Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Not knowing who the people on the other line when placing the order, I imagined their friendliness orange face green hair singing \"Oompa, Loompa, doompadeedo I have a perfect puzzle for you...\". Oh yea, every kids dream come true!\nI had lots of difficult request but they made it happened. I got to pay for the cake through the phone and had the cake write 'Joyeux Anniversaire' rather the usual 'Happy Birthday'. I didn't even have to spell the french words as the chef himself was French and no wonder my best friend's husband had no comments to-date. He's been placed in a magical Oompa Loompa's spell. \n\nIf I ever go back to Las Vegas, this will be my first trip and last trip before I head back to town of The Wizard of Oz."

Soooo on the night of my birthday, they all realized nobody bought one for me. OUCH... major ouch indeed. To play it off, my Father previously bought a loaf of chestnut bread and stuck a candle in it and yes.. That was my birthday cake. My Father goes.. What?!!?? What's wrong with this.. It's good.. something different this year. I go.. yeah right that's Not a birthday cake, it's a loaf of bread. You guys forgot about my birthday cake?!??!! They couldn't even look at me.. I gave my Family the look of \"how could you?!\" After that experience, it's a tradition now that I get my own cake and everybody is happy! :)\n\nThat being said, a fellow yelper, Leos L. raved about this new French Bakery Pastry Bistro. So the curious georgette that I am, I looked up this place on Yelp and read the reviews on what's good here. One picture struck my interest of this marvelous, playful looking cake. I was sold in my birthday cake hunt. Nestled in the back of Roy's Restaurant on  W. Charleston Blvd. you'll find where this hidden treasure is located. This place is more than just sweets, they also serve lunch and chocolate candies too! \n\nThe cake of choice is called The Fraisier. And what a cake it is... Consisting of fresh whipped cream and sliced strawberries as the filling... stacked up taller than the usual birthday cakes, this beauty came with colorful, glowing purple and red macarons with ginormous strawberries side by side each other and toasted sliced almonds all over the top of the cake! All around the sides even had sliced strawberries as part of the crust. Looked quite artsy and creative! Just looking at this cake, it reminds me of Disneyland. Makes you feel so darn good inside, maybe a little giddy perhaps, but it's one of those sights you see that just brightens you up and brings excitement in your eyes. After staring at this cake, my first bite made my taste buds Scream for joy!!! The richness in taste wasn't so empowering, but very much so inviting. Everything just melts in your mouth and the fresh whipped cream with sliced strawberries literally made such an impact, I didn't speak a word until I finished my delicious slice of heaven. Savor the moment?!! I savored each bite! So fresh and moist, this was seriously a luscious cake. They wrote Happy Birthday Suki on a separate.. what looks like the same texture as a macaron bun. Everything almost looked 3-D-ish.\n\nIt was also my first time being introduced to macarons!!! I'm familiar with macaroons with the sweetened, shredded coconuts, but not this type of pastry. It looks like a mini tiny Tiny solid color hamburger. The buns almost having a egg shell like feel, but more delicate than that. With an airy crunch density as you first bite into it, while the inside is creamy, yet soft. The filling flavor can be practically anything you want to create. That's the fun part in trying a macaron or making it. It's made well if both buns have a ruffled skirt. I would try to describe it in another way, but that's inappropriate. Use your imagination and maybe you can figure that out :P Weighs and reminds me of a toasted marshmallow, but with tons of more pizazz!!! Great addition to put on cakes, it completely transforms it to a tantalizing playground of fun!\n\nThis is one of my favorite cakes to buy for any occasion and I'll definitely go back to try more pastries especially the Tiramisu and Camille. If you don't want the full commitment in getting a cake, try a slice of the Fraisier. It might even make you say.... Oh la la! Bon Appetit :D"

I must say the tiramisu I had was amazing. It was so soft and moist and I could taste all the flavors of espresso and cream. I don't think I would come back for the macaroons but I would definitely come back for their cakes. FYI my friend and I could not find this place. It's really called the French bakery not patisserie manon and its in the shopping center across the street from all the outlet stores."

The chocolate filled croissant was good, but we enjoyed the croissant that came with our meals more! Only reason why I don't give 5 stars is because we didn't enjoy the coffee! We got 2 lattes (one with single, the other double) and 1 iced mocha. They were bearable, but it was definitely a let down given everything else! Overall, we enjoyed the food and it was a pleasant experience! Just needs a little work on the coffee :)"

They do have a caf\u00e9 style eatery, but I usually wear my PJs and get my pastries to-go.\nThe \u00e9clairs are absolutely filled with deliciousness and are always fresh! They have chocolate, vanilla, chocolate/vanilla, and coffee--all are fabulous!  The double chocolate croissants are another favorite."

Its far and away the finest bakery in Las Vegas. They kick it old school French with modern twists. Sublime, breads, cookies & pastries. Secret weapon is the outrageous and in house made country style pate. Try that with one their bagettes and you'll think your walking the Champs Elysees"
