            "review": "Finally got to try them out.  The donuts were fantastic, but the service sucked, slow and inept, and it was so loud inside the kids working the counter couldn't even hear my order.\n\nI guess I didn't get here soon enough after the grand opening to take advantage of the great deals some other reviews have mentioned.  The really clever and heavenly varieties are $1.95 each, definitely not cheap for a donut.  The more conventional ones are a dollar, and are still quite good, but if you're coming here for something different, it's gonna cost you a pretty penny.\n\nMy big splurge was on a strawberry shortcake donut, and it was incredible!  Both the cream and the dough were among the best I've tasted in all my years in Henderson.  I want to try a bunch of others, but like most humans, I have to limit my donut consumption if I want to limit my visits to the cardiologist."

The lady  next door was nice enough to tell me they get here anywhere from 10:30 to 11. This is bad business and the best way to have this location close quickly."

I was walking around Town Square and remembered they had opened here, so I had to stop in. \n\nDecided to do a half dozen to sample. \n\nFat Elvis (x2)\n\nCampfire s'mores \n\nCheesecake \n\nMaple Bacon\n\nKey Lime Pie\n\nAfter my first bite of the Fat Elvis, I was excited for this flavor, then I had a second bite and hit the horrible peanut butter frosting in the middle. It was so artificial tasting. Key Lime Pie, I love anything citrus/sour, this again was so artificial tasting and it burned going down (not in a spicy way, a not nice sour way). Maple Bacon was beyond my comprehension. The bacon was horrid. \n\nI will save this place for all the donut lovers. Wasn't my thing."

            "review": "Good donuts but the girl (Asian, 20's) who works here needs a major overhaul in customer service and food handling.\n\nFirst off, it was a little hard to find as it's in a small space and tucked away in a tiny nook of the mall. (It's located across MAC Cosmetics, next to Tommy Bahama Restaurant & Bar.)\n\nThere was a couple she was helping before me so I waited patiently for my turn outside as it's kinda cramped inside. After they were done, I approached the display to look at the donuts for sale. She asked if I was ready to order and I said, \"No, it's my first time so I'm still deciding.\"\n\nInstead of saying something like, \"Thanks for coming in\" or \"Let me know if you have any questions\" or \"Order when you're ready,\" (nvm actually trying to recommend things!), she replied with \"Oh good timing\" and turned around to text on her phone acting like she was so relieved to have a little break. #ohnoshediint\n\nWhen I was finally ready to order, I first asked her if she liked the Green Tea donut. She replied with \"I don't know. I never had it.\" Ok... Needless to say, I didn't feel like asking any other questions after that.\n\nI ended up picking out 3 different donuts and as she was bagging them, I noticed that she didn't use gloves, just wax paper, which is totally fine.....IF she actually used them properly! She grabbed each donut with her THUMB touching them! This is after she collected money from the previous couple and touched her phone to text and touched her hair. Sorry, but I don't want your germs all over my food. (She did the same thing to the couple before me.)\n\nAgain, the donuts I got were pretty good but I definitely will not be back to this location. Go to one of their other locations instead. Unless she works there too. LOL"

It's a glazed doughnut then stuffed with the pb-cheesecake filling topped off with whipped cream and sprinkled with butterfinger bits! Must try! \n\nBarvarian cream also really good!!

Unfortunately, they were almost out of everything...which leads me to the next subject at hand. There are some things to know about Pink Box.\n\nThey open around 10 or 10:30 and they sell sell sell what they have baked for the day, and when they run out, they close up shop. So if you want to make sure you get the donut you want, or ANY donuts at all, get there early!\n\nI wasn't overly opposed to settling for a different donut since they were out of bacon one I had wanted to try. I couldn't decide between a raspberry filled and a chocolate glazed, so I got both. To my delight, the girl working the cash register offered to give me a third one on the house, which I quickly and excitedly accepted, and got a sugar glaze. My total was $2 - I was ecstatic!\n\nThe donuts are amazing! I mean, how much better can one chocolate glazed donut be from another?  Well, try this one and you will understand. I intend to return on another day early enough to get my pickings."

I decided to give it a second shot because besides the service, I know their donuts are damn good. I got there around noon and to my delight, almost every donut was available. I bought half a dozen and they gave me to 2 free chocolate glazed donuts! I asked the employee what time they usually open and she said whenever she gets here and they close once they sell it. That was the only thing I still didn't like. But I am happy walking out with my Pink Box and a very happy 5 year old with two chocolate glazed with sprinkles donuts in hand (for free I might add again). I'm sure I will be back!"

I'd be in diabetic coma. \nWait a sec...this place doesn't make donuts...silly me. They're pastries disguised as donuts! When I arrived, there really was no need to go simple...what's so special about an un-special donut. Do try the Fat Elvis, Nutty Pig, Sweet Potato, Strawberry Shortcake, Banana Cream...these were outstanding. Can't remember all the others right now cause I'm in Sugar Haze. Oh... If you don't get a Cro-Do(cronut) when they have them you're either a damn fool...or you don't feel like jogging home to pay for that awesome lapse in dietary judgment.\nWe bought a dozen for the nurses at the hospital where a friend was staying...several people saw the pink box and tried jacking them. That's some serious flipping d-nuts man!"

It was delicious, crispy on the outside, and legit. \n\nBacon Maple Bar- 1 star.  It's got nothing inside, just some maple and bacon on the top, and wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped. \n\nThe Donut with the custard cream - 5 star. OH SO GOOD. Custard was light and fluffy.

As a business owner, I was incredibly impressed with their service.  Right when you walk in someone is greeting you and holding the door open for you.  Several people said hello and everybody had a smile on their face.  Well done.  As I was leaving, the employee (or possibly owner/manager from the looks of things) said something that stood out.  He said, \"See you again tomorrow.\"  Love the subliminal message, nice touch.  I will see you again, but if it were every day I could be in trouble."

I only work 4 miles away, so I wonder why it took me so long to finally try them out. \n\nI knew I was going to the gym later on in the day so I wanted to indulge a little. I walked in and everyone was so welcoming!!! The girl at the counter was so convincing that I needed to get more than one donut. I ordered 2 maple bacon bars. I was in a hurry so I didn't have time to REALLY look. I freaking inhaled it so quick. Sweet, salty, soft and amazing!!!\n\nMaybe I'll leave my house earlier next time so I'm not in a rush.

It is a light yeast glazed donut topped with a mound of pumpkin mousse that is light and fluffy.  Before trying the donuts at pinkbox, I was 100% anti cake donuts. But pinkbox's sweet potatoe donut is to die for. It's not too heavy or sweet and is super moist. The Choco-puff has just the right amount of cereal on top to add great crunch!"

Why not get some Pink Box intermission. I never knew Pink Box was open 24/7. Not sure if that new since it been open for sometime but that worth whole star by itself!! One of the best things about going in around 6or7. The display of doughnuts with every tray of every flavor filled makes you go into doughnuts nirvana! Seriously!!! I had no idea where too start my doughnuts journey so went with assorted dozen. Couple that really wanted too make sure try one was Maple Bacon doughnut (really anything better kick start morning then Beer and bacon greasy doughnut?) Wait maybe not the beer rather coffee  but was doing some day drinking. I wish could say tried piece of all dozen doughnuts but that just sugar overkill. The three that had Maple Bacon, Red Velvet, and special of the day (green tea) all awesome. Maple Bacon everyone knows but the diced up perfect crispy bacon on top with brown sugar glaze or think on top come together on point. It one of the more filling ones with the bacon but love fact every bite bacon till the last bite. Red Velvet love all things especially pancakes. Red Velvet just as good as best red velvet pancakes or cake every tasted. The cream cheese frosting on top was perfect compliment too it. The special of the day green tea another one of those love all things green tea. Really stood out was the green tea cream filling not only was the creme filling delicious but not overpowering green tea rather right balance. Only thing could have done without is the whip cream on top or garnish. The rest of the doughnuts never got around too but only heard great things about them from my iceacholic family. \n\nThe boxing of the doughnuts think are awesome! Never been fan of mass chains with the perfect size box for dozen doughnuts. If get assorted tend too get all crossed up more so with the tight packing. Pink Box not only the fact the box is Pink just like the name but nice big/high boxes leaves plenty of room for doughnuts not matter the amount. Nothing better then opening box of doughnuts that look as pretty as they were picking the assortment. \n\nThe service was fabulous from the minute walked in. Warm greeting. First timer the staff was really patience with me cause like mention doughnut nirvana trying too pick dozen assorted. The inside kind of small but then again doughnut shop although they also have few tables outside. \n\nSure if ever in the area need get my doughnut fix on plan on stopping by trying more doughnuts!!!"

They are not the best donut shop in town and I think people are blinded by the fact that they have a fancy shop and fancy looking donuts. Got a half dozen donuts and the two of us each had bites of all of them to try it.

The campfire smores is deceitful as it looks like it is a filled donut but to our disappointment it is a regular donut with marshmallow on top -- not gourmet as they state. The others were just ok (cocoa pebbles one, chocolate filled and the nutty pig).\n\nThey are good, but not 4 - 5 star good. If I go back, it will be for a cronut most likely."

Thankfully they have great weekend end hours being open 24 hours Friday and Saturday and I made this journey for some sweet treats. Upon entering the store you can smell the doughnuts baking from the parking lot. We made a few selections and luckily some were just baked so we got them from the rack and not the case, nice and warm. Very friendly service and patience from the staff. We made the poor girl stand there as changed our mind several times on the selection. I really enjoyed the Maple bar with bacon, the spelled it differently and it tongue twisted me when ordering and the tutti fruiti with the fruiti pebbles on it. Thankfully one is opening on Eastern because this Summerlin location is far for me."

I stopped by on Saturday, their second day in business, and wasn't shocked to find a limited selection in the doughnut case. Potential customers were leaving empty handed upon finding no chocolate doughnuts remaining on the shelves... tough crowd. I believe doughnuts are an effective cure for disappointment, so I ordered a regular glazed (yeast-raised, though cake was also available) and a cup of coffee. My first observation about the doughnut was that it wasn't overly sweet. It had a nice homemade flavor and some chew to it, in contrast to those Krispy Kreme- style ones that dissolve in your mouth like cotton candy because they contain nothing but sugar and overly-processed ingredients. It was a nice-sized treat for $1, and they even offered to serve it on a plate so I could take a seat at the (doughnut) bar and eat inside the store. Service was very enthusiastic and friendly! The pricing structure is uncommon, with filled/jelly doughnuts costing 50 cents more than plain, and the gourmet varieties going for $1.75. Once they can keep up with the high demand for doughnuts a little better, I'll be back to try the apple pie fritter and buttermilk bar.\n\nMerry Christmas Update: I'm giving Pink Box a well-deserved upgrade to 5 stars after my second visit on December 24, when a much better selection was available, including apple fritters! I'd like to see more apple in the fritter and it had the texture of cake rather than a yeast doughnut, but it was very moist and tasty. At $8.50 for a dozen, you'll have plenty to share and get a better deal than paying for individual doughnuts! Since making it to my car juggling a baby carrier, dozen doughnuts, and requisite cup of my favorite Pink Box coffee would require two trips, the owner carried my pink box out for me... now that's awesome service! Now, to try that buttermilk bar..."

The lights were dim, and neither girl greeted us, never smiled and did not thank us.  Sad customer service.  Then, when we arrived home, we found we were only given 11 of the dozen (12) specialty donuts we ordered, and of the eleven, three were not what we ordered.  The donuts were good.  But given the employees lack of desire and ability to count , I will apparently continue to patronize Krispy Creme, even though their donuts are not as good.

If you do have a sweet tooth and specifically a love for a good donut, then Pink Box Doughnuts may be your final destination for that ever-tasting, \"forget the rest\" type donut.  Here, you'll find what I call \"exotic\" donuts.  These are donuts that you won't find at a Krispy Kreme, Dunkin Donuts, and Winchell's. The donuts here are over the top and just looking at one of these creations can give you a toothache.  My normal donut of choice is a simple glazed or maple bar.  But I didn't hit up Pink Box for something as vanilla as that.  So, I opted for their Nutty Pig.  This donut is all in the name. Nutty for the almonds and dates.  Pig is for the bacon bit that's thrown in.  Now add these toppings to a custard filled glazed donut.  Viola!..the Nutty Pig is born.  Fairly sized, but i still managed to eat this thing in less than 5 bites.  Definitely sugar overload for me, definitely a great treat for someone with a sweet tooth. \n\nThe staff here is great.  At least 5 employees were here at the time and at least 4 of them welcomed us.  Pink Box is not the biggest donut shop, but huge on taste. For someone that doesn't frequent a donut shop, I gots to say \"I'm a fan\"."

When I bit into the cronut it was flaky, slightly doughy, with a nice soft crunch as I bit through what seemed like hundreds of layers of goodness.  I'm sure they are a dietary nightmare, but when the tradeoff is for something this decadent, I think it's worth it. Yummmm.\n\nThen also had a maple doughnut which was really amazing as it had a crunchy outside and soft/ warm middle.

He said they didn't but would make it just for us for our special day! \n\nWhen I arrived, he was incredibly nice! He had the order day mixed up but you couldn't tell. They just packed up the dozens of doughnuts. He apologized for not having the butter pecan doughnut, he couldn't get the recipe right when he tried earlier in the week. I however explained that the butter pecan wasn't necessary and he through in another dozen donuts. Then he kindly helped me into my van with them, as I had a rambunctious three year old with me. \n\nThis is the second time I've been here and each time it's just been amazing! Thank you!!"

The only gripe I have would be the fact that they do not put out the apple fritters until 6am. Otherwise, the product and the service is fantastic. \n\nMajestic Megg working the counter definitely has more energy than anyone I have ever seen. I was falling asleep at 3am, but in her presence I was wired.\n\nThe goods themselves are definitely top notch. The Baple Macon (As Majestic Megg) referred to them were some of the best I have had. The maple glaze had a thin exterior coat and then a gooey center. The fruity pebbles one was also delicious. There is no way to keep the cereal crunchy, but the flavor was good. The cake doughnut with lemon glaze compliments the topping well. The biggest disappointment I had was with the strawberry shortcake. It was just a few pieces of fruit with a whipped cream dollop. It could have used some Bavarian cream or custard."

The donut everyone talks about is nutty pig. I tried it but its fine. My personal favorite is the fat Elvis. It's a peanut butter filled, chocolate frosting and banana topped piece of deliciousness that I would do dirty unspeakable things for. \nIn fact the only two negatives of this place is that two of my favorite donuts white chocolate peppermint and strawberry shortcake never seem to ever actually be in stock and I've actually gone there and had them completely sold out which it's absolutely amazing and shows everyone loves them. Also, I'd love for them to be open later, me and all my friends have no problem eating donuts at any time of the day and due to working office I'm usually only able to go on weekends. But you can't always have it all. I still love them even if they are bad for my diet hahah"

I've also tried the actual \"cronut\" in New York, and wasn't too impressed either.  \n\nOn my way to the airport, I decided to stop by and pick of a box.  And boy was I in for a treat.  There was a short line, service was great and friendly, and quick!  The options of the so many kinds of specialty donuts was quite vast.  It was the cronut that caught my eye.

I ended up with some Fat Elvis' (is it Elvi when there is more than one?), Bacon Maple Bar, Strawberry Shortcake, Blueberry, Pink Snowball, Cookie N' Cream, and a couple regular style doughnuts.  We haven't eaten them all yet, as we have a little bit of restraint, but so far what we have tried have been great.  \n\nMy favorite one was the Bacon Maple Bar.  I always dip bacon in maple syrup, so I knew I would like this one.  That first bite was a wonderful piece of nirvana in my mouth.  I saw stars and got weak in the knees as the flavors unfolded.  Delish!  My hubby has enjoyed his Fat Elvis and the Bavarian Cream ones.  My mom was visiting and snagged the Pink Snowball and said she may just like it more than me, her own flesh and blood!  \n\nThe doughnuts were tasty but a little pricy at $12.50 for a dozen.

We went yesterday however they were sold out of the Cronuts which was pretty much the only reason we went.  I called Friday to make sure they made them because I had been dying to try one and they said yes they come out between 9:30 & 10:00 am.  So we got there about 9:40 and they were all sold out.  That is why I am giving a 4.  For a place that is open 24 hours a day, why do you only make a limited supply of what seems to be a favorite for everyone and once it's gone that's it, especially so early in the day?!?! That is the only complaint that I have.  Make the favorites all day long or at least twice a day, once in the mornings and once again in the afternoons.  If they sold out in less than 15 minutes, clearly you have a hit on your hands!  I will go back, I just need to go early to get my new favorite donut!"

That is until a recommendation from a friend led me to the discovery of some unique doughnut flavor combos. What stood out in my mind the most was the Fat Elvis, the Campfire S'mores, the Strawberry Cream Cheese Granola and the Maple Bacon Bar. When I first stopped in this past Saturday morning I ordered the first two as I did not see the latter two in the display case. The Fat Elvis was good but quite a mouthful. It is a doughnut stuffed with peanut butter and topped with chocolate glaze and a piece of fried banana. Without a drink it was hard to swallow. Literally. The other doughnut, the s'mores one, I like in theory more than in reality. It was a regular chocolate glazed doughnut with toasted marshmallow in the hole then topped with a few graham cracker crumbs. If I had the equipment and know how of making a donught, I would make a filled doughnut with marshmallow fluff in the middle, chocolate glaze on top and more coarse graham crackers rather than the fine crumbs. The way Pink Box make theirs was very tasty but extremely hard to eat. I ate in my car and made a huge mess. I had sticky peanut butter and chocolate glaze all over my hands like a little kid. \n\nAs for the shop itself, it was busy on a Saturday morning as hundreds of kids were playing soccer less than a block away. Thankfully, rather than running things first come first serve, the staff helped people who were ready, like me, before finishing with the people taking longer like the family ahead of me. That was nice. I was worried it would take me forever in there.\n\nWith the price of these doughnuts I do not see myself coming in frequently. They do run higher than regular doughnuts. But these, with some exceptions, are hardly regular doughnuts."

            "review": "Still hunting for the ultimate donut has led me to Pink Box. After consulting with fellow Yelpers, I was intrigued by this place. Apparently, PB has some of the most unique flavors of donuts in Vegas, including the maple bacon. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to check out this place because, on this day, I had a doctor's appointment that was in close proximity to Pink Box.\n\nPink Box is located in NW Vegas on Lake Mead Blvd and Buffalo, in the Summerlin Plaza. Since PB is located in a busy shopping center, parking here can be a little hectic.\n\nInside, there is a small display case where they show their products. It is a small store, but it feels very warm and inviting.\n\nThere are 3 types of donuts to choose here: Classics, Specialties, and Gourmet. Classics are your more traditional flavors, glazed, sprinkled, etc. Specialties are donuts that have a interesting, unique flavors. And Gourmets are donuts that have no rules, anything is \"up for grabs\". I checked out a couple from each category. (I actually chose 4, but the owner was cool enough to throw in some extras ones that I didn't have :)\n\nClassic Vanilla Sugar: My true measuring stick for any donut is either a glazed or sugar raised. The one at PB is good. A little bit on the chewier side IMO, but good nonetheless.\n\nClassic Blueberry Cake: This is where I think PB excels the most. Their cake donuts are Delicious!! Soft, but still had a nice chew, moist interior, and the flavors were well balanced. The blueberry flavor tasted like real ripe blueberries and was present throughout the donut.. Definitely, one of my faves here.\n\nSpecialty Sweet Potato Cake: Once again, this cake donut was another home run. It was more dense due to the sweet potatoes present, but, it was still soft and moist, and the sweet  potato flavor was present, and not overpowering.\n\nGourmet Campfire Smore: I liked the concept. It was a yeasted donut with a chocolate glaze, burnt marshmallows on top, and a cream filling. I thought it tasted good until the filling started overpower my mouth with sugar. I mean, this donut was SWEET!!\n\nGourmet Fat Elvis: It's a well known fact that Elvis loved deep -fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches. PB's version used a bruleed banana on top, and a peanut butter and banana filling. Once again, it tasted good, but the filling was too overwhelmingly sweet, almost as if I stopped chewing midway through and was like, \"This was pretty tough to finish...\"\n\nGourmet Date w/ a nutty pig: This is probably the closest thing we have in Vegas to the Maple Bacon Donut that other donut shops use in different states. PB's version uses caramelized bacon, maple glaze, figs, bleu cheese, toasted almonds, and a maple filling. Couldn't really taste the bacon or the fig, but I could taste the bleu cheese and almonds, moderately. Again, the filling sort of killed it for me.\n\nOverall, the yeasted donuts are a 3, and the cake donuts are 4.5, and the service was a 5, the owner was very helpful and generous. If they can figure out how to make their fillings less sweet, I think that the yeast donuts can go up to a 4, if not better. I was happy to try this place, but... off to the next one!!!!"

That's a lot of stuff going on for one doughnut but the presentation is quite nice and has an attractive prettiness to it. The light purple/grey glaze is cleanly put on the plain raised doughnut. \n\nThe middle of the doughnut is sprinkled with pretty bits of bacon, blue cheese, slivered almonds, and  I was told dried figs. The figs resemble dates, to me. The fig/dates have been slivered and arranged in a quadrant splaying from the middle.\n\nThe Nutty Pig is a bit messy at first bite as bits of bacon, almonds and blue cheese crumble from your mouth , but the flavors meld together as you chew, chew, chew.\n\nNom, nOms!"

I think to keep up with the demands and the rush they \npre-make their doughnuts way too in advance and it's not a fresh as it use to be. For example the whip cream on top of the doughnuts was so old to the point it was hard and really killed the mood for me. \n\nThe service is still very nice and the price is good about $19 for a box of mix gourmet and regular doughnuts and the selection is amazing just wish it was as fresh and flavorful like before. I remember biting in into every soft scrumptious doughnuts with my eyes closed and being super satisfied now I'm just trying to keep the dream alive and believing in them. \n\nOh and even though I love Red Velvet out of all things skip on the those the cake dough was way too dense and had absolutely no sweetness or taste at all. The top frosting was awesome but the doughnut it self really was a fail. \n\nI just found out that there is a Pink Box closer to us on Durango which is perfect, I might have to try that location out before I really write them off!"

My 2016 UYE was a \"dash for da donuts\" at Kamehameha Bakery at 3am in the morning, repeat: 3am!\n\nSo on our recent trip to Vegas we had a chance to meet one of the Vegas heavyweight elites, Christie L. a gold elite to boot.  Christie and I friended on Yelp a year or so ago, her reviews and comments about donut shops in her area was a primary attraction.  When our trip to Vegas was finalized a meet and greet was arranged and lucky for me, a suggested meeting place was,\n\nPink Box Doughnuts!  \n\nOne of Christie's favorite donut places, we   were introduced to another world of whimsical and creative donutry of Sin City.\n\nThe donuts were great!  What did we try?\n\nThe Fat Elvis- a yeast donut with a banana slice, honey and peanut butter.  Delicious combination of flavors that will make you want to shake your hips.\n\nThe Thin Mint- a yeast donut with thin mint Girl Scout cookie bits and mint frosting with a delicious filling, very refreshing. Limited time only.\n\nA later acquisition was the  Pink Rainbow Sprinkles- a cake donut that looks just like a donut out of the Simpsons.  I would call it the \"Homer\" but they probably couldn't because of copyright infringement- doh!  It wasn't as sweet as it looks, perfect with coffee.\n\nWe later picked up the \"Date with a Nutty Pig\".  This was a weird one.  Yeast donut with bacon crumbles, dates, almonds, blue cheese, balsamic vinegar and maple icing.  The tastes for me were not complimentary but too contrasting which drove my tastebuds wild.  This is the only time I didn't want to finish a donut but I will also say it could be a rapture for someone else.  You know, different strokes for different folks.\n\nWould we go back again? Hell, yeah!  They've got quite a few other flavors we want to try including their take on the cronut which is suppose to be in a class of its own.  This location is open 24 hours so you can get your donut fix anytime and the workers here are da best! \n\nThe absolute highlight was meeting Christie and Marc over donuts and milk on a cool Vegas evening.  Mahalos for da donuts and milk my Vegas Sistah and Bruddah.  The only thing better than munching on a donut is munching on a donut with friends.  Thanks again Christie and Marc for spending some time with us."

My costumes included a tight black leotard and extremely tight black high-waisted shorts that pinched into my waist accentuating the lovely curves of my love handles, a skin tight, respiration inhihibiting nude unitard swept with gold paint and dusted with rhinestones, and a blue rhinestone encrusted watery unitard, while more forgiving on the waist, showcased my lovely male camel toe. \n\nAfter my last performance, I quickly switched my diaphragm back on, learned to breathe again, and pulled my dance belt out of my rectum before turning to Yelp to satiate my need for glazed, powdered, and filled goodness.\n\nAfter a quick search of donut shops in the Summerlin area, I chose Pink Box because of the unique flavors of donuts and raving reviews. I decided to order two dozen donuts to share with my fellow dancers. One dozen for me and a dozen for everyone else. We chose at least one of every flavor they had on stock which included:\n\nApple Fritter                    Maple Bacon\nGlazed                            Chocolate Bar\nChocolate Glazed           Maple Bar\nGlazed Cake                   Fat Elvis                   \nCheesecake Filled          Fruit Loop\nChocolate Filled             Bavarian Cream\nRaspberry Filled             Key Lime\n\nThe best donuts that induced my sweet escape into glucose overload were the apple fritter with its crunchy exterior and gooey interior and the fat elvis with its peanut butter and banana filled center. \n\nNow that my body and mind have returned to reality, I cannot recommend this donut heaven enough especially with its patient and caring staff of highly trained donut handlers."

They are one of the more intentional places around concerning friendliness.  They have classic, specialty, and gourmet doughnuts.  The prices are low enough for me to treat others, while the quality is something I can attach my name to (Comments often go like; \"Yes, that was Mr. that brought in these delectable, fancy doughnuts...)\n\nThey make it easy to mix-and-match with stupid-proof combinations and standard dozen arrangements as well.  If you're still getting typical doughnuts from the grocery store you should give a specialty doughnut shop like Pink Box a try.  Some of gourmet options are wonderful...including a personal favorite of mine, the Fat Elvis!"

The store is small. There were a few of us in line and we all had to keep maneuvering to let one another by since it was so cramped. \n\nTheir fridge was down, so they were keeping all cold beverages in the back. They have quite a few options as far as donuts so but nothing really stood out to me surprisingly. I decided on the green tea because it looked the most enticing and the tutti frutti because I thought it was the most photogenic. \n\nThe girl behind the counter was really nice and I was on my way out the door with my selections in no time. \n\nThe green tea was my favorite. Fresh, soft and subtle in flavor. I enjoyed this donut the best of the two I chose. The tutti frutti did nothing for me. It was overly sweet and the frutti pebbles on top had hardened. The cake donut was well-made and I ended up scraping the icing off and enjoying that part.\n\nOverall, everything I tried was decent but I don't see this becoming my go-to donut spot."

Making a good donut isn't too difficult but these guys want to turn up the science and creativity level all of which is completely unnecessary. The dozen I bought for my overweight office has had a hard time finding any takers. This could be because the donuts are overcooked and to the sight are not appealing. Once they are in your mouth much doesn't change either. They are crispy when they should be fluffy. When it comes to donuts I like to keep it simple... chocolate bars, devils food, rainbow sprinkles... nothing too crazy. I tried the sweet potato donut but wasn't impressed. Tune down the fancy, don't overcook and keep it simple! \n\nI may try it again, but I'd rather eat at Winchell's or the donut shop on Durango & N I-215 any day of the week instead of Pinkbox."

Fat Elvis so far is my favorite - all the flavors together melt in your mouth -no wonder he loved peanut butter and bananas. With the apple fritters you taste the cinnamon and apples-not fried sugar. The cereal-topped donuts will transport you back to childhood. Fruit loops, coco pebbles and Capn Crunch top rich and delicious chocolate or original glazed donuts.  Double yumm!!! This place is a hit not a miss. Even the house blend coffee is worth the trip.\n\nI'm hooked. Now I want to share with friends. Enjoy!!!"

I'm sure all the other review talk about how wonderful their specialty donuts are so i don't need to go into all those details. I'll just say my two favorites are their Cronuts (you have to ask, they don't always have them and they're not usually on display) and their Bacon maple Bar. I have dreams about them both!\n\nThe location is small, just large enough for a display case and a few patrons, but the decor is cute and the staff is simply wonderful! The owner is often on site, there's often a greeter at the  front door, and on occasion they've been known to throw in an extra donut for good measure. Yesterday's visit I unexpectedly got a free Cronut - not that I need the extra calories but it made my day!!\n\nOn one visit there I was babysitting a puppy who'd just gone through surgery and lost one of it's legs. I couldn't leave her in the car so I brought her in, holding her in my arms - something I would never do under normal circumstances. The staff didn't mind at all, they welcomed her, petted her and treated me as well or better than every other visit.\n\nThese donuts are the bomb, but you should give them your business simply because they are good people. Don't hesitate.. just go!! Just be warned, you need to buy more than one donut or you'll wish you had."

            "review": "A ton of my friends were posting pictures of their doughnuts from Pink Box and that same day, my boyfriend had tried one at work.  Everyone seems to love this place, especially on Yelp, so we drove to their Lake Mead location two Saturdays ago.  When we arrived, there were a lot of people in line, but not a lot of variety when it came to doughnuts (none of the cereal doughnuts, no cronuts, etc.).  \n\nWe ordered a gourmet dozen featuring:\n Fat Elvis:  Our favorite.  The peanut butter, chocolate, and banana flavors all really go well together.  It's heavy, rich, and overly-sweet.\n\nChocolate-Bacon Bar:  We really didn't care for the chocolate-bacon one; the bacon was too smoky (it seemed like artificial smoke flavor and the bacon bits were really hard). \n\nBanana Creme Pie:  The flavor of this donut was divine, but the messiness was a real nuisance.  Both of our donuts squirted (not oozed, but squirted) all over the place and it was not fun trying to clean it off of our shirts, the carpet, etc.\n\nCheesecake:  I personally really liked this doughnut.  It's rich and creamy; I especially like the chocolate icing on top of the doughnut.\n\nS'mores:  I always love anything S'mores flavored, but this doughnut was a disappointment.  It really didn't taste anything like a S'more and we'll never get it again.  The filling reminded me of the sickly-sweet white cream inside of the krispy creme doughnuts, which tastes nothing like marshmallows (in my opinion).\n\nApple Pie:   I hated this one, but I hate apple pie.  The apples were crunchy, ew.\n\nI don't mean to be hard to please, but I think I'll have to visit again to see if their other options are better.  I think people just go crazy over this place because of the \"novelty\" of it, but it's really nothing special from what we could tell."

I noticed that they revamped the display case and only display one of each doughnut available at the moment while everything else sits on racks to make it easier to fill peoples orders.\n\nwe decided to go with a Maple Bacon Bar, Nutella Doughnut, Bubble Gum Doughnut, and a Banana Cream Pie Doughnut. Took two bites of the Banana Cream Pie, and a tiny bite of each of the rest. The texture of the doughnut seems to have improved a bit, \nbut for me, the toppings seemed too overly sweet and/or very artificial, so we fed the garbage can the rest.\n\nI still prefer the OG stand alone shops that have been around a lot longer (Ronald's.

My only complaint is a lot of the specialty or gourmet doughnuts I wanted to try were not included in my order.

I try to eat healthy and limit the amount of sugar so this is definitely a \"treat\" to partake in every once in awhile. I can't even remember the names of the donuts that I bought, but they were beautifully made. The two donuts that I ate were flaky, sweet, flavorful, and fresh. I like that the donuts have unique ingredients, mixtures, and toppings- Pink Box is very creative. The two employees were friendly and helpful with our questions.

            "review": "Pink Box has been on my book mark list ever since it opened almost a year ago and since I started working close to this side of town I FINALLY got my chance to try them. $8.50 for a dozen is pretty reasonable in my book because Krispy Kreme costs like $13. I ordered a dozen plus a gourmet one which was the pumpkin cake. The pumpkin cake was good, but unfortunately didn't knock my socks off. I should of tried the pumpkin cheesecake, but the employee recommended the pumpkin cake because of the chocolate shavings on top. I also tried the blueberry, it was just \"okay.\" It would of been better of the blueberry flavor was a little bit stronger. Although I was not wow'd by the 2 donuts I tried, I will still give them a few more chances until I find a donut that does. On the other hand, my co-workers enjoyed the donuts, specifically: What A Joy and Lemon Pie were the favorites, I guess next time I'll have to see for myself. \n\nI'm giving them 4 stars because there is no other donut shop in town that has such creativity as they do and the ambiance/interior is super cute, even if it is all pink. Make sure to call ahead if you are going there for a specific donut because I know they only have a certain selection each day and cronuts will be available after 9:30. Can't wait to come back and try Pink Box!"

            "review": "This place was recommended by a friend since he said they were open 24h a day and they always had fresh donuts. We ordered a variety of donuts but I have to say I only tried about 3/12 because we took them to a party/potluck. The place is quiet small and there is no where to sit and enjoy your donuts if u wanted to eat it there unless you wanted to sit outside in the Las Vegas 100 degree weather in the summer. \nThe donut selection wasnt very good. And I hate to say it but we got a couple of the dulche de leche ones because my husband loves that flavor and it was such a huge disappointment! It taste like a regular glazed donut with chocolate filling on top (and a bad regular glazed donut as a matter of fact.) \nI always judge a donut shop by its regular glazed donut because all that other crap is all just toppings and fillings to hide the real test: the dough and cooking. \nI hate to say it but I had the regular donut twist and that was cold and not soft and kinda chewy. \nThe only other one I tried before people took some of the other ones was the blueberry one. That one was pretty good. Cake like donut with lots of blueberries in it but it tasted artificial to me. \nFrom what I heard from people at the party is that they werent impressed either. And the one someone said they def didnt like was the one with the colorful \"what looked like fruity pebbles\" on it as the fruity pebbles were soggy and tasteless- his words not mine.\nIm not sure if ill come back here and Im sorry I couldnt give this a better review :("

It was very light and fluffy which made it easy to eat it very fast.\n2 Cinnamon Tornado - WOW these things are enormous, light, sweet and do not have too cinnamon in them.\nSweet Potato - I asked the young lady who waited on me her favorite and this is what she suggested, I'm glad I listened to her, it was different but definitely worth trying and I would get it again. \nOriginal Glazed - I think anyone could devour at least three of these and not realize it because like I said, all their donuts are so light and don't weigh you down. \n\nThis company is doing great and I can't wait to see how they expand and come up with more ideas.

I think) was very friendly and assured me that they did.\n\nWhen I arrived I noticed the place is indeed tiny. Not a place I would want to come when it's busy. Being that it was almost 2am I wasn't expecting fresh donuts. To my surprise I was actually able to snag a few that were just made. I kept it simple and got 6 donuts. I don't like chocolate not am a fan of cream filled donuts so I didn't try any of those. My daughter chose the strawberry shortcake one ( one if the fresh ones) and is in love. I got a glazed , blueberry and apple fritter for myself. The other two were tutti fruity and a chocolate bar. \n\nI love the blueberry donut! I somehow made one disappear before I got to my car. I sent my daughter to go buy one more and she came out with two fresh ones!

The \"raised\" versions are not raised at all, but are very cake like.  I haven't tried the \"cake\" version, because the \"raised are already far too dense.  The flavors are much too mild. I've ordered the glazed twice. One had no glaze at all, but was plain, and the next had barely a drizzle.  The sweet potato is ordinary, the jelly is flavorless, the buttermilk style is so-so but almost too dense.  I've had 3 visits in hope to find something good, but have found nothing at all.  Had high hopes, but no luck.  Oh, also, the overcharge. After mentioning problems with a couple of doughnuts they offered to give me a replacement.

I thought the gourmet donuts just weren't all that and it was all just hype. \n\nI was in the area again after dinner one night and decided to give them one last try and dang! So glad I did!  They were so much better this time! My favorites include banana creme pie, the old fashioned with sprinkles, coconut one, cereal bar, maple bacon. I could eat them all!    I've been returning once a week now to pick up a half dozen (unfortunate for my figure) but great for my tastebuds. \n\nDepending on what time it is, the freshness will vary. I've been at many multiple different times and days and it really just depends but I would assume every morning they would be at their peak freshness. \n\nUntil someone starts an out of this world donut shop this one will stay my favorite!"

If donuts are considered a dessert, then hands down, my favorite dessert ever is a good ol' donut! EVEN better is the cronut. Now, I never waste calories and I am known to spit stuff out if it falls short on taste...\n\nWe got the Fat Elvis, Regular Cronut, and a Chocolate donut. The Fat Elvis was just as the name describes it, fatty! Peanut butter and banana filling with a touch of honey. It's a favorite there but it wasn't mine. The boyfriend thought the mix was noncommittal - it should have more peanut butter or more banana and the mix just made it uninteresting and bland. It wasn't my favorite, but it also wasn't spit-worthy.\n\nThe cronut on the other hand... LOVED the texture! I love the taste of a plain glazed donut, so the taste of the regular cronut was delectably donutty with the buttery flakiness of a croissant. It was DELICIOUS. The chocolate donut was simple yet nicely represented the quality of the actual donut dough - it was soft, fluffy and moist. A good judge of donut quality are the basic ones like this plain chocolate, as it's taste isn't amplified or confusing by fillings and unique toppings; just dough and a glaze.\n\nIf you were to only pick one, I'd definitely get a regular cronut! Yum yum!"

Atop a kitchen counter, dining table, or in an office, automatically donut fans would expect there to be donuts.\n\nI liked that when I walked in, the store did not have the aroma of donut grease.  You know what I mean though?  That Rainbow Donuts place I used to go to in Riverside had that donut grease smell.  No... it won't make a good scratch and sniff sticker or a gag scented candle.\n\nI like that when approaching the doors, a musician in his musical zone was feeling his music, while jammin on his electric guitar.  I asked the donut connoisseur if that was okay by them.  He said they like his music.  I completely agree!  The musician sells CDs too.  Thought about it, and it would be cool to sit out there and listen to his tunes while being a donut face.\n\nI love that Pinkbox has funky fun flavors like Bavarian creme filled, mocha creme, chocolate creme filled, chocolate rice crispies, cinnamon, and red velvet.  All perfect with a mug of caffeine!  Cuz donuts are sugarful, straight black coffee for me - to balance the rich sweetness with a bitter unblue-ness.  NICE!"

Little did I know, I finally got a chance to give them a try when 4 dozen of these were brought to the office one morning. And honestly....this was NOT worth the hype. I've tried the \"pink velvet\" and a heart shaped periwinkle frosting custard-filled donut. A few of my co workers had the coco puffs, raspberry filled, pink sprinkles, fruity pebbles and Fat Elvis (she really enjoyed that one). What a waste of empty calories! =( It was wayyyyy tooo sweet and I felt like I would've been much more satisfied eating a Sprinkles Cupcake instead if I was going to stuff myself with sweet fatty empty calories. Just not worth it at all. My co worker said her coco puffs tasted stale. My \"pink velvet\" was super sweet!!!!!! Holy shit. O_O no thank you. And what's a pink velvet supposed to taste like? To me, it really just tasted like a regular donut. A co worker's fruity pebbles flakes were soggy too. (is it supposed to be a soggy consistency and not like an expected regular \"cereal crunch feel?\"\n\nSo to sum it up:\n-not worth the hype\n-way too sweet (sugar overload this early in the morning. I got a headache as I type this)\n-it looks better than what it actually tastes\n-some are better than others so choose wisely. Fat Elvis: good. Pink Velvet: bad.\n\nMy 3 star rating isn't because I don't like the place but just my personal opinion based on my taste buds. I know everyone's sweet tooth is different. If donuts are your type of thing, definitely give it a try and by all means...enjoy!"

Don't worry, I didn't eat it all by myself, I just tried a piece of them. The fat elvis had peanut butter inside, it came in second place for my favorites. The cherry fritter had a nice tangy taste, not as sweet as apple fritters.\n\nLet me tell you about this cronut though. A croissant/doughnut mixture? When you first look at it compared to the other beautiful doughnuts, it makes you think, \"why did I come all the way here for this?\" BUT when you take that first bite, it's definitely worth the visit. It seems unreal. They bake this fresh at 9 am! If you can come when they come out of the oven, I think you'll see your life change in front of your eyes.

The donuts were unique, yeasted, a little dense, and chewy. there was just the right amount of frosting on each, and the Fritter was my absolute favorite!

It is local to Las Vegas with multiple locations across the valley.\n\nDon't look for garden variety doughnuts here, although they do have a devil's food glazed that ROCKS. They have their regular options, like the Fat Elvis (it has a caramelized banana slice on top), but also have a special creation that changes from month to month.  It entices you to come in every month...cuz when the flavor is gone, it's gone!\n\nDefinitely not your standard doughnut spot.  Worth a stop in, especially if you are new to Vegas!

Small wonder.\n\nThe cronuts from Pink Box are smaller in height than the others we had at our tasting.  I was told that they were much closer to the original cronuts introduced in NYC.  The cinnamon sugar cronut was OK but was greasy compared to the others we tasted.\n\nThe staff seemed to be in a fog.  Mr. Pink Box was there in his outfit to greet me and bid me adieu, but the business needs someone with organizational skills and smarts at the counter.  You can have the best doughnuts going, but if you give me the wrong stuff, it's a fail in my book!"

So tonight as the hubby said \"I want doughnuts\" I told him about this place and hyped it up we drove across town and thats all she wrote...\n\nWHAT A WASTE OF GAS... the doughnuts are overly sweet and honestly my thoughts were 7/11 produces the same quality doughnuts... The frosting, shortening and glaze are full of sugar and no flavor. You can taste the lack of money and quality that goes into the doughnuts.\n\nI paid 14 for a dozen to try every flavor so I couldn't limit my review and I must say I wish I would've saved my money went to my local doughnut shop and got a dozen for half the price.\n\nAll in all thumbs down...\n\nSave your money hit up Winchell if you want mediocre doughnuts for a reasonable price."

The doughnuts themselves are generally not too sweet, which I like, but the toppings trend far too sweet and are sometimes artificial tasting for my preferences. That said, they have been eagerly devoured by everyone when I've brought a box or two along, so, to each his or her own. \n\nRecently, I've stopped in several times to grab a few dozen for staff at MountainView Hospital: just seeing the box they got excited and gobbled them all up. So, I'd say that you are pretty safe to make most people quite happy if you arrive bearing these sweet treats!\n\n* online ordering available *\n\n** they deliver **"

The first experience wasn't that great because I had a Apple Fritter that wasn't good. I have since never ordered one of those and tried some of their other options. If you have never tried the Fat Elvis and love peanut butter, you should try it. The Fat Elvis is my favorite by far. The doughnuts here are a good size and range in price from $1 - $1.75 each. I haven't tried one of their Cronuts yet but you can call ahead and they will have have some ready for you if you can't be there at 9:30 am when they first come out for the day. Don't try and ask for one at 8 pm like I did. The guy behind the counter will laugh at you and say \"No, we sold out for the day\". These must be some damn good cronuts. As long as they aren't coated in overly sweet icing like that nasty \"Coco's Donuts\" then I am down to order some and check them out. The guy behind the counter was nice and let me know they were open 24 hours on weekends. If you stop by just after they open at 6 am you will smell the aroma of doughnuts as you walk towards the door."

The apple fritter specifically - I like it better than any I've had in the area (previous champ = Winchells).  I also liked the boston creme and cake-like donuts.  And, the price is decent, $12.50 for a dozen of basically any 12.  \n\nNow there is some bad news and this is more subjective than anything.  The peanut butter/banana one did not do it for me.  I thought it might but it did not.  Also the smores doughnut was good but it (for me anyway) could have used some \"stuffing\" inside.  Maybe some hersheys or marshmellow creme would have made it even better.  \n\nI got there at like 8am, had my run of the place.  I don't think it's that odd at all to get to a doughnut shop at 10am and find they are out of everything good.  If anything that's typical (except for maybe Krispy Kreme) and I buy doughnuts all over town several times a month.\n\nIf you like apple fritters please try this place.  If you like doughnuts in general also consider popping in.  I mean a half dozen is what $5 or so - shouldn't break the bank and you probably will be pleasantly surprised."

Pink Box is going for the WOW factor...something different....something to get people talkin.  Which if you haven't heard the buzz by now then you don't get out much. \n\nWe all know the new \"dessert with bacon\" craze and the extreme cooking shows that like to shock you with unique and crazy ingredient combinations that you wouldn't see everyday.  This is right down the same line of cooking craziness.  Speaking of cooking shows, did you know that Pink Box was featured in \"Roadtrip with G. Garvin\" on the Cooking Channel?  I think it was a small kick-start to the madness.  Quite impressive I must say....you should check it out. ;)\n\nSo I was asked to bring a dessert to a get-together.  I'm always the overachiever that wants to figure something thats new to everyone with a goodness to leave a \"mad at it\" (but in a good way) impression on everyone.  As I think about what I want to do I remember a few recent Yelp reviews that I had read recently.  How could it be any perfect on the overachievement level???\n\nFirst off I decide to check them out online.  They have an \"order online\" option.  Perfect because I was at work and it was totally convenient and fast.  I put all my info in and it thanked me for my order.  I stated that I will be picking up around 1pm while I was on my lunch.  IF ONLY this system worked....read on...\n\nWhen I walk up you could smell a delicious sweetness in the air.  There was a sign blowing in the wind above the door stating that its now opened 24 hours on the weekend.  I guess there is a need?  For your drunken satisfaction?  I'm gonna have to do a drive by in the middle of the night.  There might be a party going on at 2am that we don't know about!  When I walk in there are 3 people already in line.  The place is not that big so it filled up pretty quick.  There were employees in the back talking and laughing.  I kept hoping that one of them would come up and help the poor guy trying to assist everyone considering I was on my lunch and drove way out of my way to get there.  Finally after the few people funneled out it was my turn.  Mind you at this point there was already a line behind me.   I let him know I ordered ahead online.  He sifted through all these papers and mentioned that his boss didn't give him any order for me.  Party FAIL...so much for convenience!  SO starting from scratch I made my random selections.  I also ordered two extra to bring to my boss hoping he might let me off early. hehe...no such luck.\n\nThe guy was super nice and helpful.  He rang me up for a dozen and gave me the two extras for free for the trouble of not having my order.  The total was something like $8.50.  I had thought on the website it would be $12 something.  Oh well I wasn't going to ask.  So I get my pink box of heaven in the car and notice the grease or icing or something seeping through the box.  I opened the box and the donuts were all over the place just thrown in the box.  I counted 11 donuts.  Hm  I could have sworn a dozen means 12.  Scratching my head. Oh well whatever as I roll my eyes.  This only happens to me.  I. swear.\n\nNow I went for a variety of everything with intention that we would cut them up eventually so everyone could try a bite of each.  The maple bacon and the nutty pig were among the favorites by far.  They have all kinds of regular donuts along with their specialty kinds putting a little love in each one.  The nutty pig has bacon and blue cheese on it.  There was barely any blue cheese but those who ate it loved it.  Some of the doughnuts are topped with cereal...captain crunch, fruity pebbles etc.  Kids would be in heaven.\n\nAnyways, overall and not really being a sweets person I wasn't overly impressed.  I do love the concept and I will for sure return for 1 or another dozen (TWELVE) to take to a get together. Personally I can just stick to the regular glaze doughnut with rainbow sprinkles.  I do recommend them to put wax paper underneath so they don't soak through the box....or they may have to change their name to Soggy Box Doughnuts!   Werrrrd.  =P"

I tried nearly all of them but I enjoyed the almond joy one the most. It wasn't too sweet and the doughnut part was great. The smores doughnut was great with the marshmallow on top as well. I tried the banana and it was good - it tasted like banana pudding and real bananas. \n\nMissed out on the Elvis doughnut but oh well! I would visit again :)"

I bought a half-dozen Cronuts here and they are outrageously priced, over two dollars each. I would not suggest ordering them because they're not even the best ones in town.  The rest of their donuts however are worth talking about. First of all they have three different price points so be careful the classic ones are the cheapest the gourmet ones are the most expensive and there's a mid-level priced one.  They always have a daily special so I'll talk about the daily special I had when I went. It was a Coco Puffs Donut.  Yes you heard me right a chocolate bar with cocoa puffs on top.  Really really awesome. I also bought a maple bar with bacon on top. The bacon seems slightly artificially smoky but the concept is a decent one.  I will definitely go back to this place."

Very comparable to a doughnut that you would get in the Smith's bakery section, with an added scoop of frosting or peanut butter. They aren't bad, they just aren't anything special. The red velvet donut is pretty good.. kinda taste like cake, but again nothing I haven't had before from Dunkin Donuts. I wanted to be fair in my review, so I stopped and tried a couple more doughnuts on another occasion. Same experience. If you really want a 4-5 star doughnut, go to Ronald's."

I definitely don't get the \"we want you to eat here\" vibe, which may be one of the reasons it is so small inside. Anyway this is all perfectly fine with me because I don't want to be seen in public stuffing my face full of delicious donuts! \n\nThey offer 3 styles of donut, all at different price tiers. They have the classic flavors, that are $1 each. You know the kind I'm talking bout; plain and chocolate glazed, sprinkles, sugar. Basically the kind you can get anywhere else. Then they have specialty flavors, $1.50 each, which includes some traditional favs such as creme filled and maple bars, but also spicing it up with some fun flavors like sweet potato and chipotle caramel. And then of course they have the gourmet flavors. And that my friends is where things get a little weird, but in a good way! \n\nI chose 6 gourmet flavors and it was $10 each. We tried:\ncheesecake\nchocolate cronut\ncookies and cream \nmaple bacon bar\nfat elvis\ncampfire s'mores\n\nMost of the donuts I tried were soft and chewy, except for the cronut which was a bit stale. My fav was the cheesecake donut followed by the cookies and cream. The maple bacon left something to be desired. This place is now open 24/7 so you can get your donut fix anytime day or night."

Their selection has been a bit more reliable too. That's also good. After my first review, the manager (owner?) contacted me, apologized and even offered me some free donuts. Obviously, since I wasn't fishing for freebies, I declined. It was a very nice gesture/PR and definitely didn't go unnoticed or unappreciated, though. So, yep, that's good too. Honestly, this place seems like it's getting it's act together now....for the most part. My only real complaint now is that we caught a cashier ranking our experience as 5 stars (or whatever the top tier rating is) on the register screen without asking us or giving us a chance to do it for ourselves.

My daughter and 2 of her girlfriends came for a weekend visit, so the hubs and I decided to grab some donuts as a quick Sunday breakfast before they headed back to California.  After scouring Yelp reviews, we settled on Pink Box.  Gourmet donuts. I never even knew there was such a thing. I almost feel jilted that years had passed in my life without such a blessed discovery.  Their selection was incredible, making it difficult to decide on a dirty dozen. We ordered maple bacon bars, Apple fritter, smores, cronuts, a pink velvet and choco locos. Not one donut remains.  The girls and my husband couldn't stop raving about them.  Huge hit.  definitely plan on returning when relatives are in town for the holidays."

I could leave the Key Lime Pie and S'mores.  They were just eh.  But the Fat Elvis and apparently the Peanut butter cheesecake -- because I wasn't fast enough to get a bite of that one -- are incredible.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the fruity pebbles covered doughnut.  This location is 24/7, but if you are trying to do this as breakfast, roll out early.  On Saturday at 8 a.m., the line was out the door and they were selling doughnuts faster than they could fry them.  Grab a fork and prepare to feel like Elvis right before the end."

Went to the Durango/Montecito location and got the green tea, maple/bacon, and fruity pebbles doughnuts. We brought them to share with my parents. Regrettably we were unexpectedly disappointed. The word we used to describe them was \"stale.\"  Although I was disappointed I made the excuse that we got them from a satellite location. I was willing to give you a 2nd try. \n\nYesterday I wanted to bring my coworkers a treat so I made it a point to wake up extra early to make it to the main Lake Mead location before work. I saw on Yelp that you had the \"cronut\" so I was looking forward to trying those. Sadly they were not present so I asked the person who helped me to put together a mixed box of the specialty, non gourmet doughnuts. When I got to work, my coworkers and I were excited to try the cool flavors...a lot of brightly colored cereal and sprinkle ones, some coconut ones, and some filled ones. They all looked so delicious. Again we all were surprisingly disappointed. \n\nBasically they tasted like grocery store doughnuts with a creative topping. I personally love the toppings...they're pretty and so creative but I would've preferred a better tasting, better quality doughnut. \n\nAs much as I wanted you to be my new fave local place, I think I will have to stick to Krispy Kreme for now. Thanks for the opportunity to voice my opinion. Good luck to you."

I really only wanted one -- ONE -- maple bar.  Just a simple maple bar.

I stuck to my guns and only ate one, and took the rest of the box home to the kiddos.  But that one donut was fresh, yeasty, glazed to perfection and simply perfect.  The staff was friendly, the customers patient, and the line moved pretty fast considering the small space they have to work with and maneuver around in.  Definitely a gem in Summerlin, but too close for comfort for me and my donut addiction.  That's the only downside I have!"

I had been before with my grandfather a few months earlier and we were disappointed with all but the fat Elvis and we ordered a 1/2 doz.... I decided to give it another shot. I like supporting local businesses. \n\nMy 1st mistake was going a noon on national donut day- there were only like 6 types of donuts left. Of course none of which had maple, bacon, or peanut butter: FIE!!!\nI did my best and picked 3 flavors to try.\n\n The blueberry cake was freshly done which should have been awesome, but the cake was mushy from the glaze and it was a sad greasy only vaguely blueberry first bite. I decided to move on. \n\nBlueberry fritter this is the best thing I have had from pink box hands down! I would give it a million stars for its perfect state of fritterness - a yeast based dough that rose beautifully and had the perfect amount of sweetness - fried to perfection- and glazed like Lord Jesus himself had come down to do it. There was just one problem- it doesn't remotely have any blueberry flavor. Yes I can see bits of blueberry in there.... but no taste man. I wouldn't even complain because its still damn good- but if you call something blueberry - it better damn well taste like blueberry!\n\nPink glazed cake with sprinkles- again this was still warm. Had a good crumb, but their cake donuts are generally much softer than traditional cake donuts. I probably would have liked it more if it wasn't fresh, which seems odd to me.  It was fine. I didn't hate it but it wont' visit me in my dreams either. \n\nOverall I wish there was more consistency with the donuts there. There are a few banger ones, but most are just OK."

The owner apologized and extended himself generously by offering me 6 complimentary doughnuts to make up for my last mediocre visit. I was really looking forward to trying their green tea doughnut, alas I hear that one has been discontinued for unforeseen reasons. As I browsed their current selection, I was able to get solid feedback and recommendations from the staff on all of the doughnut options - I ended up leaving with 9 doughnuts! Well over my quota. \n\nMaple bacon cronut - This is what cronut dreams should be made of. It was huge with a generous topping of bacon and maple glaze. The buttery layers were great and didn't collapse on itself with each bite. 5/5\n\nCinnamon tornado/ twist - I'm a sucker for cinnamon & sugar and they did not let me down on this one. There was a generous spread of glorious cinnamon and sugar in the center of the twirl 5/5\n\nCookies & cream - dear lord this one should be illegal. It is crazy decadent but also crazy tasty. I also loved the little crushed oreo bits sprinkled on the top (it needs more) it added such an awesome texture. So good and drool just accumulates as I imagine it. 5/5\n\nApple fritter - It was fried perfectly crisp on the outside and semi-bread-y on the inside. I wish there were more apple chunks but it will do just fine 5/5\n\nSweet potato - This tasted identically to a sweet potato muffin, not too sweet at all, extra muffin-y 4/5\n\nOld fashioned sour cream - Nice version of the classic, crispy on the outside and soft sour cream cake on the inside 4/5\n\nBlueberry cronut - I'm personally not a fan of their blueberry mousse topping, it doesn't stand out 3/5\n\nBavarian cream with a chocolate glaze - I wanted to love it, but something was lacking 3/5\n\nPeanut butter & jelly - The peanut butter was dense, so it coated my taste-buds and I couldn't really enjoy the rest of the doughnut. Maybe more jelly filling would have balanced it out better? 3/5\n\nI was delighted by the level of care and concerns they had about my initial experience. It's awesome to know they take feedback very professionally and constructively. They seem genuinely concerned with their customers' experiences and I value that a lot in a business. True, many of the doughnut options I tried didn't blow me away, but they are solid confections, suitable to make anyone's day better. \n\nPro tip: Keep in mind they are always changing flavors and sometimes the good flavors run out if you come too late. If there is a specific one you had in mind, it would be beneficial to call them before you head over."

On Guam that would be empanadas, turnovers, and these homemade sugar twist donuts still hot from the fryer.  I used to go in my pajamas because I hated dressing up.  Donuts are a favorite of mine, even Winchell's when I was growing up.  My father would stop in and we would buy a dozen donuts to share with my classmates or for his workplace. I would always get first pick out of the box and it would usually be the sugar twist.\n\nFlash forward to 2013, where donuts are on a whole new level and The Pink Box is dishing up some doozies.  I know, fellow readers--these crazy donut concoctions started a few years back and this is old news--but have you tried Pink Box's donuts?  The minute you eat one of their amazing creations you seriously go\n\nI know I did.\n\nOur first encounter with the Pink Box was a few weeks back while out antiquing with my mother and husband.  I looked up donut shops nearby and this place happened to be on the list.\n\n\n\nThe logo is adorable, the donuts listed look sexy, so I figured it would be a great donut adventure.  \n\nWe parked along the building and noticed a slight line forming to get in the door.  Luckily the line subsided quickly and we entered the tiny shoppe to see a full glass case and racks of donuts behind it.  There were donuts for every taste--salty, sweet, bacon, fresh fruit, and sugar sugar sugar.  I was excited about the nutty donut with bleu cheese and figs, the baconator maple bar, strawberry shortcake, sugar glaze twist, classic red velvet cake, and a chipotle caramel round.\n\nI never expected bleu cheese with figs on a white glazed donut filled with pasty cream to be so...pornographic...but it is.  The flavors of salty bleu cheese, chewy figs, slivered almonds and that pastry cream just have this crazy flavor orgy.  I then moved on to the baconator bar--who doesn't love their pancakes with maple syrup and bacon all in one bite?  The shortcake and twists were fantastic and light, as well as the velvet, but the star of the show was that sexy, gooey, spicy bitch--the chipotle caramel donut.\n\n\nThis is the one that you take home to mother.  This is the donut of all donuts.  It is simple, spicy, and perfect.  That fluffy fried goodness, I imagine, is dipped and waved in that spicy caramel mix for a second or two, then flipped and dripped on a rack.  I love that the chipotle is mixed into the caramel and specks are on the donut.  When you bite in to it, your tongue sings a serenade of love.  My husband and mother asked for a bite, and at first I was like \"YOU GET NOTHING!\"  \n\nThat's mean.  \n\nI gave them a third of the donut each and we all sat in silence, in the car, chewing and \"mmm\"ing at the grandeur of this beautiful, round pastry.  \n\nThe Pink Box has my heart and my tastebuds whipped.  I will never cheat on her.  I will remain faithful and love her until the end of time.  It is more than the crazy concoctions they create that gets me; their donuts bring me back to my childhood, the moments in the car with my father where I pull the twist apart and eat it like cotton candy--two fingers, pulling and prying it apart until it's all gone.  He'd smile, and I'd smile at how happy my tummy and my heart was.  These donuts bring me back to that feeling and those memories. That's what great food should do, and the Pink Box delivers."

I love the variety of unique flavors that Pinkbox carries that you can't find in any other donut shop (of course, they still have the classic glazed donut). The gourmet donuts are even better; my favorites are the banana cream pie and strawberry shortcake. I have yet to see and taste what new flavors they have in store for the season. The pricing, in my opinion is very well-priced and reasonable.\n\nFor those of you that would like to know about the area it is located in: Pinkbox is located in Summerlin and is in an area surround by many retailers and other dining/fast food, which is very convenient. Specifically, there's a Walgreens (or CVS, I don't quite remember which one since they look quite similar), AT&T, and Starbucks nearby it (and more); so for those of you who like to hit two birds with one (or multiple) stone(s), you can go grocery shopping, buy your new iPhone or Andriod, and/or buy a nice cup of warm coffee from Starbucks to accompany your delicious, unique, and fresh Pinkbox doughnuts. I mean, I don't know about you, but, who wouldn't want some Starbucks coffee to accompany unique, gourmet donuts?"

However overall I did find the donuts overly sugary and the flavors weren't a home run. It's almost like the flavors were teetering on the edge of fantastic however they were having second thoughts half way through,  and then end product fell a little short. I wanted more bold flavors- more punch! more pizzazz!\n\nThe date with the piggy donut? - interesting combination. Chopped dates, with tiny bacon bits, and it looked like blue cheese? Almost, but not quite there. The dates were a little hard, the bacon was not salty enough and the pieces were too small. I wanted more of the salty and sweet contrast\n\nPumpkin cheesecake- too mushy. The filling + the cream piled high on top was too much. I love sweets but this was absolute sugar overload. Not enough pumpkin flavor.\n\nPink velvet- nice concept. But the only thing that made this \"velvet\" was the cream cheese frosting on top. Basically a regular donut which pink food coloring- lacking the richness from a typical red velvet. \n\nOverall I would buy things to bring to an office pot luck or to a party for the WOW factor. Beautiful creations, awesome presentation. But flavors fell a little short."

            "review": "First, I want to say I am super glad a donut place is now in this area of town. I shop over here for groceries regularly and always was sad that there wasn't a donut place in this shopping area on Lake Mead, so that's a huge plus.  Okay, maybe not  a huge plus for  my diet but hey, gotta get a treat now and then, right?\n\nSo I made my first trip to Pink Box recently, got a dozen which was slightly over $9.00 which is a great price for these somewhat more upscale donuts.  Here's a brief listing of what I got and my opinion of the quality:\n\nraspberry filled - definitely can taste the difference between the gloppy commercial fillings and the fresh raspberry filling at Pink Box.  It was good, my only recommendation would be to maybe not fill them quite so full, the raspberry gets very messy and runs everywhere since it isn't quite as thick as the usual glop fillings used in chain donut places. .  Also, I would prefer a glaze rather than sugar on top, as the \"grit\" factor gets a bit high between the sugar grit and the few raspberry seeds (not a big deal, but there's room for improvement).  But for those of you who are used to artificial goopy raspberry fillings in chain donuts, your tastebuds need to be re-awakened  with fresher flavors and I do believe that's what you will get at Pink Box.  With some  tweaking, I would probably buy more of their raspberry filled.\n\nThe vanilla sugar donut was very nice - light, sweet taste, pleasant donut\n\nChocolate glazed - yum, the chocolate is a full-bodied dark  chocolate tasting, you can really tell the difference between this chocolate glaze and the \"meh\" commercial glazes used at chain places.    \n\nBavarian cream filled - again, very nice, fluffy light and good\n\nPlain glazed - nice...maybe a little  dry but a minor issue.  I must confess, I'm partial to  Krispy Kreme when it comes to plain glazed donuts but that's just me and in no way takes away from the Pink Box plain glazed.  Perfectly acceptable and satisfying.\n\nMaple bar - light, not heavy sludgy like some maple bars I've had at commercial chain joints. Not over sweet, just a refreshing maple flavor on the glaze.\n\nChipotle - this was a special flavor of the day - didnt work for me, wayyyy too hot and spicey, but hey, nothing ventured, nothing gained, and I appreciate a place where there's a fun new donut to try and experiment with.  \n\nFat Elvis- peanut butter, glazed banana on top, yum, enjoyed it and would order it again.  \n\nThey didn't have any of the sweet potato donuts that day so didn't get a chance to try those but will in future.  \n\nOverall, I have no complaints about Pink Box.  Very pleasant and friendly staff, efficient, clean and a much needed addition to the neighborhood.  I do feel that by tweaking and playing with their recipes somewhat  they will find the pefect blend of regular standbys and experimental fun stuff.  I also agree with the reviewer who said that many people are so used to over processed mass produced donuts full of air that they no longer know what a fresh donut tastes like.  \n\nI was there around 10am and they were fully stocked, lots to choose from. You won't find all the different varieties every day, but plenty enough to get a good sampling.  They also have a couple of outside tables which will be pleasant when the weather is  warmer.  I didn't try  the coffee so can't comment on that one way or the other. \n\nWhile there was nothing here that utterly blew me away (well, maybe the chocolate glazed did,  with the  very nice dark chocolate flavor), I will definitely be back. There's certainly nothing here to dislike, just certain donuts that may or may not be to your style.   Next time I'll try the s'mores and a few of the other popular flavors.  Lots more to try, and I will be back!"

Saturday?).... and they didn't have any of the specialty donuts. Just regular ol' donuts... Another woman was also in the store, and the staff member in the back whipped up a whole order of the good ones for this woman, but when inquiring minds asked for some as well, we were quickly shot down and told that all they had were the ones in the case.\n\n....what? Perplexed would be an understatement, as less than a minute ago I saw a staff member hand another customer a box full of them. Sure, maybe the other woman had sent in a custom order ahead of time, but you work in a donut store with donut supplies, surely you could've made some, and we would've waited, likewise, it wasn't like we had come in at 2am and they were out-- I didn't think 7pm was such an unreasonable time to expect them to be stocking the donuts that made them famous, esp. given they advertise themselves as 24/h. A group of about 5 or 6 people walked in after us and walked right back out after they saw no donuts as well. \n\nMy friend and I begrudgingly bought a couple of plain donuts to try anyway, because hey! maybe these are the best donuts I've ever tasted, I don't want to knock 'em till I try them. Meh, they're donuts, nothing special and could have been from any 24/7 store around the valley. \n\nSo, sorry PBD, I really had high hopes for you, but after a couple snarky remarks by your employees and your lack of donuts, I can't recommend you. :("

They have half and full dozen boxes (pink of course!) with prices ranging from $8.50 - $12.50 for those.\n\nI saw on Facebook they were now selling \"Cronuts\" so of course I asked about those. They were sold out! I spoke with Lance behind the counter who said they had made Cronuts 3 times that day already. I went just after 11 am so apparently people are scrambling to try them. Not having tried the original from NYC, how can I really compare it though? I guess I just want to taste it and get some sort of idea what it might be like. I will try again! Lance says you can just call ahead and if they have the menu item you are looking for then they will hold it for you. \n\nSo I decided that I needed to try the \"Fat Elvis\" after hearing about it and I am kicking myself for not trying this sooner. DELICIOUS! It is just flat out good! The Fat Elvis is topped with chocolate icing & a caramelized banana, and filled with a homemade peanut butter & banana filling. This doughnut had me feeling stingy since I didn't want to share a single bite with hubby, but I had to darn it!\n\nThe 'Apple Fritter\" needs some work. The texture is perfect. It is soft and chewy inside, and crunchy on the outside where it needs to be. The thing that gets me is why it's called an apple fritter if there are no apples in it? I didn't bite into a single apple! Boo-Hoo!\n\nWhen I saw a Doughnut with fruit loops on it I had to give it a try. I was told by a worker that this was called the \"Fruit Loop Doughnut\" and I get the fun concept, but it just doesn't work. The long glazed doughnut is really good, but the fruit loops they put on top just absorb the glaze they rest on so they are soggy and chewy. \n\nLast and certainly not least is the \"Cinnamon Tornado\" and I have to tell you, it lives up to the name. When I took the first bite it was like a tornado of instant flavor, and it seriously melted inside my mouth. Very yummy.\n\nThere was a sign out front that said they are now open 24 hours on weekends."

They have one of the best selection of flavored doughnuts and the menu changes throughout the seasons. Some of my favorites are the GreenTea and Maple flavor ones. Apple fritters is one of the best and doesn't dry out like others. But the best is their Nutella filled glazed...it's only available through special order but it's a must try. It's a small shop and it can get very busy since it's a 24hour operation."

I must say their doughnuts are remarkable. They are made fresh throughout the day. I had one issue with them that the very quickly resolved it. I went there to order the cinnamon bun doughnuts for my little brother's 18th birthday since they are his favorite. They girl told me they would be ready in an hour. She took down my information and said she'll call me when they are ready. I went by there an hour later only to find that they weren't ready and she tried to give me doughnuts I didn't ask for. She said well come back again in an hour and it will be ready for you and it will be on the house. At this point I'm frustrated because I have left work each time to pick them up. The final time, I had my brother with me, which was not the plan. The girl who took my order had already left for the day, I explained to a manager what happened. She was so compassionate. She offered to give us some other doughnuts and have someone deliver the freshly baked cinnamon roll doughnuts. I told her that it wasn't necessary, but she repeatedly insisted. I finally told her that was fine. Since I had already had the issue earlier with them not keeping their word, I wasn't counting on them doing so. I received a call that evening and they sent someone to deliver doughnuts to me. I was in shock. This was true customer service and I will be returning since they have the very best doughnuts in town. My brother was so happy."

Not one that's been sitting at the local Walmart for 3 days in a row and is still semi-soft, or one overly sweet as Krispy Kreme can be.  When I want a doughnut, I want it fresh and made with real ingredients.  A doughnut that if I don't eat it within 24 hours it's just not good.  And if all preferences were possible, I would love that doughnut to be warm.  There is something to be appreciated about a warm, fresh plain glazed or cake doughnut.  It just hits warm memories for me.  \n\nPink Box Doughnuts is fairly new to the neighborhood and is actually a less than 10 minute drive from where I live.  That makes it way too easy!  As for most, doughnuts are throughly enjoyed in the morning with a warm beverage or some milk.  Pink Box is busiest during the early morning hours.  The smell of fresh doughnuts being fried can be quite intoxicating.\n\nPink Box can easily be found off the intersection of Buffalo and Lake Mead.  Just look for the big pink sign!  Upon entering you will notice the theme of pink around the entire place.  For some reason it just seems fitting.  It really makes you feel like you're in the mood for a doughnut.  The morning we went there it was busy.  The line was nearly out the door.  Good sign!  \n\nDoughnuts from Pink Box come in three different categories and price points:\n\n-$1.00 for Classic doughnuts\n-$1.25 for Specialty doughnuts\n-$1.75 for Gourmet doughnuts\n\nClassic doughnuts include plain and glazed, cake doughnuts, blueberry, and a few other flavors to choose from.  Specialy donuts are kicked up a notch, and include the doughnuts that have filling to them, including, raspberry jelly, Boston Creme, chocolate, among a few other various choices.  The Gourmet doughnuts are where Pink Box goes all out with some wacky creations.  From treats like a S'mores doughnut, Macha Green Tea doughnut, to the ever-popular Fat Elvis (one of my favs filled with peanut butter and topped with banana), it is a sight to behold.  Imagination gone wild!\n\nA dozen of the Classic and Specialty donuts will set you back about $8.50.  There is a nominal extra fee if you want to include Gourmet doughnuts in your dozen.  But you shouldn't have to pay more than $10 for a dozen of all the ones you want the most, so go buck wild!  Get all those crazy flavors!  And of course, your dozen will come in a requisite PINK BOX.  It just makes it all seem so officially snazzy.  We met the owner that morning, and he is beyond a nice guy.  Very friendly and very knowledgeable in all his doughnut types.  I don't plan on being at Pink Box EVERY morning, but when I do want that occasional doughnut I won't mind coming back here.  A lot of dough(nut) for not a lot of dough!  DOH!"

The Fat Elvis was one my daughter enjoyed since it had her favorite trifeca of banana, peanut butter and chocolate.\nThe service was very friendly and accommodating. I was told they are opening a location in Henderson and Centennial Hills. Oh my sweet tooth is in trouble!"

There was no flavor!  The donut had no flavor, the whipped cream had no flavor and even the strawberries were bland.  Wth?!?\n\nI bite into the cheesecake and thank goodness that was full of rich cream cheese flavor otherwise I would have been really upset.  The cinnamon tornado was decent.  The donuts seem to have been sitting out for a bit because it was a little dried out.  \n\nI don't know, I think next time I'll just stick with Krispy Kreme, this place isn't all that it's cracked up to be."

They have normal offerings and a rotation of flavors. \n\nMy personal favorite is the fat Elvis- a peanut butter stuffed donut with a slice of banana on top. BEST DONUT EVER. Added bonus: it's on their normal rotation, so it's always available. \n\nYou can order singles, half dozen, full dozen...what ever you want. I would caution against over ordering, because the filled donuts don't hold up well when kept overnight; they can get soggy. Also, beware of the clerk stacking filled donuts on other donuts- as the filling and the toppings can/will run into one another. \n\nThe prices are reasonable and comparable to their chain store competitors. \n\nIf you're in the neighborhood, stop by and check them out. If you live in the neighborhood, perhaps stay away as this could potentially be an easily accessible caloric sinkhole for you. Lol."

When we first moved to Vegas back in 2012-13, that was when they announced their Grand Opening, and we went shortly after that. And from Bite One, I realized that we needed to keep our distance to maintain some kind of sanity...and waist line control. \n\nThat's right, folks...this has nothing to do with the products being awful.  Au contraire, mon frere. It's the exact opposite. Try any one of their gourmet varieties, and you cannot go wrong, with coffee, hot chocolate, or even a la carte.  The Maple Bacon Bars, my personal favorite, must be filled with crack or something, because I can easily scarf down a half-dozen in a single sitting, without thinking about it.\n\nAnd recently, the sheer nefariousness of impending donut anarchy went to the next level, upon discovering that THEY NOW DELIVER....\n\nThat is not a typo.\n\nAnd dammit, now I've gone and done it.  I will probably have to go online and place an order tomorrow morning...."

The line was almost going out the door as people were buying stuff for friends, family, or co-workers.\nIf you're gonna get a large order, it's better to call ahead to guarantee the flavors you want. Many of the flavors on the racks were reserved for such orders. The display was somewhat bare as many of the gourmet donuts were purchased.\n\nThe size of the donuts were large, so you may want to share. One donut was enough to fill me up. The tart filling in the keylime donut was great, reminiscent of a good keylime pie. The s'mores wasn't bad. I liked the marshmallow flavors that were present throughout. I'm glad I tried the nutty pig but I can't say I'm a fan. It's a combination of flavors that isn't for everyone. My least favorite part was the cold and chewy bacon bits. Personally, I prefer my bacon piping hot and crispy. The pumpkin cheesecake donut may have been my favorite. The rich and creamy filling provided all the goodness of a pumpkin pie in a donut.\n\nWhile I'm not typically a fan of donuts, the ones here are creative and delicious enough for me to want to come back. Obviously, I'm not the only one to think that, as they've expanded to a kiosk at Town Square and elsewhere around town. A location in the southwest would be more than welcomed. \n\n4.5 Stars"

My hat is off to you, store Pink Box. \n\nThere are so many fun donuts here and they incorporate holiday donuts as well. Their maple bar has had me rearrange my whole schedule and driving route to better reason getting it. \n\nI've tried the bacon maple bar and though it's good, the original is best. I'd prefer a crispy bacon, not a hard to chew bacon. \nI've also tried the one with fruity pebbles and liked one but didn't like the second one because the pebbles went soft. But honestly, if I had to pick my ultimate favorite it would be their mini croinut (say it with me: crow-nut). Tis part croissant and part donut- gods finest creation. Dense, flaky, glazed to delightful perfection, and mini . \n\nReally I've had them all, I won't be modest about it. I often find myself staring down the Elvis Presley and the marshmallow puff one- perhaps it's s'mores, has had me want to shake the owners hand. \n\nIt's constantly busy here. The store is small and doesn't accommodate the throws of ppl flocking for their fix as well as a different layout might. The line will either start behind you or you will get into it, either way it will be there. \n\nThe workers are always smiley but I often feel rushed at the register and forget the coffee order is intended to place. They have a small fridge with milk, chocolate milk, water, and I'm not sure of any other options. No other food items. Strictly and appropriately donuts. Sometimes donut holes packaged up as well. \n\nThere's a small patio with rocky tables out front. The tables could easily be less irritating to sit at but you sit there because you wanna hack into that box as soon as politely possible. \n\nSmall changes would help the flow of the place and increase my desire to stop by more often but I think it's largely related to the size of the shop. If only the Henderson location switched with this one, oh what a world it would be."

Their cake doughnuts have just the right bite to them, with the sweet potato doughnut being my favorite of this group. And even though they didn't invent the maple bar with bacon on it (some reviewer earlier seemed to hold this against them, as if anybody outside of Voodoo Donuts in Portland shouldn't even be allowed to make them) but they did it justice. To be honest, there wasn't a doughnut that didn't wow me. \n\nAs for the staff, they were all very friendly, courteous, polite and helpful. Whatever bugs they were working out when they opened, they have taken care of. I will definitely be back...probably much more than I should. \n\nP.S. As for the reviewers who complained that most of the doughnuts were gone by 10:00 AM, maybe that says something about the quality of those doughnuts and maybe you should just try to get there before then to enjoy them. They open at 6:00 AM."

They came in a pink box which I suppose is fitting for the name of the shop though most donut shops serve them in these boxes so what's the big deal?\n\nThe big deal is the flavor of these donuts.  No matter what other toppings are piled on top of the donut, the base of the donut is packed full of deep fried dough goodness.  I guess it's one person's word over another as there are plenty of reviews here that differ from my opinon saying the donuts are stale or uninteresting, but I've eaten a lot of donuts in my day and I found these to have a good base flavor.  Then, whatever you smear or sprinkle or coat the donuts with can help or harm these donuts.  I don't need them to be super trendy, the usual frosted donuts with coconut or nuts or even just as they are work for me.  I only tried some of the usual suspects without the fancy bacon or cereal or anything else put on them. \n\nI have no idea how the staff or establishment are nor do I know if these donuts are priced higher than a game of blackjack at the Bellagio as I didn't visit this place but had the donuts brought to me.  My sister did say that the second location closer to the strip is apparently not open 24/7 so they drove to this one and then had to drive all the way to the otherside of the city (not sure how exagerated that is) to get to this location, but said it was worth the drive!  \n\nI think I'll have to check this place out for myself the next time I'm in Vegas."

Not to include I tried a maple bar with bacon on top and it was the best thing ever, it does not sound as good as it tastes, but don't judge its look and name until you try it. As well as all the gourmet donuts the prices for half a dozen and dozen donuts are priced perfectly and as well as if you're ever craving a donut they're open 24 hours which is amazing!!!"

I'd heard to steer clear of the cereal-topped donuts because by the time you eat them the cereal is soggy, so we did. Everything we got was great-cronut, fritters, cream-filled, s'mores, both bacon-topped donuts (even the one with dig and bleu cheese-against my better judgment), standard cake, cookies and cream...all of them were a delight. Pros-getting out of there with a dozen sinful pastries for under $15, friendly staff, friendly/happy/chatty customers. Cons-beverage selection, teeny tiny store (the line was literally out the door), the more heavily fried donuts were on the greasy side (fritters and cronut-like they went directly from the fryer to the glazing station without being drained for just a sec), and the fig and bleu cheese number was a touch too creative for my liking. Ultimately I'll be going back, because yum. Well done, pink box. I can understand why you're so loved by your people."

They were patient and answered everyone's questions, mainly because flavors are not marked with anything other than flavor of the month or flavor of the week. They have a Pink Velvet donut which is a beautiful neon pink donut that looks intriguing but there is no signage for it so you have ask what it is. Come on this has got to be the SIGNATURE donut which I am going to respectfully suggest they change the name to a Pinkbox Velvet donut. Anyway I got the Fat Elvis. I was disappointed which I am so sad about!! The filling was kind of like a peanut butter banana sauce.  I was expecting it to be more like a peanut butter banana mousse/ cream filling.  I think it would have tasted better.  :( I didn't enjoy it, but a lot of other people do, so I obviously know ZIP about donuts.  \n\nI am going back! Everything looked too promising not to give it another try!\n\n*******\nSecond and LAST visit:\n\nI wanted to give this place another shot to redeem itself.  One person working, NO SIGNS indicating flavors so you have to ask what everything is, which means if you have to, so does everyone else.  This results in friendly but SLOW service.\n\nI got a cookies and cream (it was labeled) and it was dry and by dry I mean a crunchy donut. A crunchy all the way through, boring tasting donut. This is why I took a star away.  \n\nI also got a pumpkin cheesecake donut.  Two bites in the filling came out of the bottom and landed on my clothes. Not a pretty look.  Luckily, I can go home and change.  This was the messiest donut I have ever eaten. It would have been good if the filling hasn't fallen out.  Is this normal for this place for their donuts to break? This is also why I took a star away and basically refuse to ever go back."

Milk and coffee!\n\nMy favorites:\nApple fritter (MFing AMAZING!)\nChocolate whipped filled\nGlazed cake (SOOOO AIRY AND LIGHT not all nasty and heavy with diabetes inducing amounts of glaze. Perfect amount of glaze IMO)\nCake with chocolate and coconut shavings\nCake with sprinkles\n\nThey have some standard doughnuts, but they always have new ones! Another awesome thing they do (I'm sure those \"top notch\" joints in NY and BFE don't do!) is if you like their page on FB you can suggest flavors and what not! AWESOME!\n\nI will continue to come here for their stupendous quality, cheap price, and AMAZING WONDERFUL LOVELY customer service! Like I said, get there early! You will not be sorry!"

They were out of the fat elvis when I went.  \n\nThe blueberry fritter has too much fried crunch and not enough soft chewy inside. It is just too small to have enough soft chewy inside I suppose. And the blueberry was virtually nonexistent. Definitely underwhelming.  \n\nOf the ones I tried, the coconut almond chocolate cake was the best, but it's not hard for a chocolate cake donut to taste good.

The guy asked me if I had facebook and I immediately said mmmmm..NO. (I didn't know who he was) He then said that if I did, he wanted to ask if I could \"Like\" his donut shop on FB that will be opening. I had two thoughts after this #1-How could I \"Like\" something that hasn't opened yet and #2-OMG a new donut shop, I'm soooo excited! I told him that I will be there as SOON as they opened!\n\nI would first like to say that my LOVE not like but my  LOVE of donuts are SERIOUS.However, in fairness I am a glazed twist type of gal. I HATE donuts that aren't fresh, I hate them so much that I arrive usually at donut shops as early as I possibly can to get the fresh batch! Onto the actual review....\n\nThe shop is so CUTE! PINK EVERYWHERE! The customer service was AWESOME. The guy with the pink shirt was so friendly and asked all my questions. I looked at the options of the donuts and was a little frightened..I'm not the adventurous type. After looking at bacon donuts and bleu cheese mixed maple..somethin..somethin..apple..idk I picked a simple GLAZE and JELLY donut. I was so happy because the guy told me that the glaze was FRESH. I couldn't even wait until I got home to eat it! I felt the warmth of the glaze from inside the bag!! How can you drive all the way home with knowing that?NOT I!!! So I grabbed that beautiful warm donut  and took a huge bite. My first thought was CRUNCHY..CRUNCHY? The inside wasn't as \"fluffy\", as I would've liked. It was more of a FRIED HARD DUMPLING with glaze. It was more of a CAKE DONUT texture inside rather than a...fluffy..light donut. The inside tasted like it had maybe nutmeg or cinnamon or..both which was a DIFFERENT taste.I just wasn't expecting it. My purpose of getting a SIMPLE donut was to to get a SIMPLE donut. I dont think this is a SIMPLE donut place! I went home and tried the jelly donut. The \"jelly\" was sour, it seemed homeade but..sour. My bf liked the orignal glaze but didn't like the jelly filled at all. He thought it was pretty sour too. He only liked the original glaze when it was warm, apparently it tasted \"DIFFERENT\" when it cooled off. That was just his opinion.The icing they put on their donuts aren't enough for ME. I would like a balance of the Krispy Kreme and Winchells icing amount.\n\n ughh I feel so bad doing this review because I think the people were soooooo NICE, but it just wasn't what I was a fan of. I think I was looking for a SIMPLE..BORING donut place and got..if Dr Seus owned a donut shop place. If you're looking for something different try them out! This just wasn't a good fit for me sadly."

Then again, that was why I chose to have it to go. The first thing I tasted was the deep fried dough (apologies, arteries), followed by the chocolate coating, and a smidgen of peanut butter. Surprisingly, the chocolate wasn't what gave the doughnut its sweetness -- which, by the way, wasn't too sweet to begin with --  rather it was the caramelized banana slice placed on top. Nice touch!  I think it would've tasted a tad better if there was a little more peanut butter filling. The one downside about this doughnut is that it was dense; I much prefer the light and fluffy variety. \n\nThe doughnuts are baked fresh daily, and there's a decent selection. By the way, don't be surprised if you smell like doughnuts when you walk out of the store. At Pink Box, you'll find the typical traditional doughnuts like apple fritters and glazed. They also bake specialty ones such as Lemon Meringue and Nutella, which they were out of when I arrived. However, Pink Box cranks out doughnuts every hour, so get em while you can!\n\nStaff is very friendly and welcoming. I arrived on the day the shop opened only to discover they closed early because all the doughnuts were sold out! The owner was nice enough to invite me in despite having closed. He spoke briefly about his shop, which I could tell he was passionate and excited about. When I last visited, they seemed to be getting adjusted to the customer flow and working out the kinks they experienced on opening day.\n\nI may not be a doughnut connoisseur, but so far I'm pleased with what I've tried."

Even late at night, you can still see people dropping by here for a snack! \n\nOne of the favorite goodies that I get from this place is the cheesecake donut. Oh, my god! Whoever thought of this is a godsend! The filling inside tasted so much like cheesecake that you might as well forget about the real thing itself. A combination of donut and cheesecake is a must try here! \n\nThey have other reputable specialties that range from classic glazed donuts to \"thin mints\". The prices vary from specialties but well-worth it.  I love stumbling into spots like these because they think outside the box. Flavors are banging with flavor, and the selections are decent! This is a must try when you're around the area! :D"

I splurged on a 'gourmet donut' and went with the Cookie 'N Cream ($1.95), which was recommended by one of the staff members. I thought an iced coffee would complete my mini breakfast, but found out Pink Box only sells plain 'ol black coffee. *sad face* Seating inside is limited, but I was lucky enough to find a table outside all to my self. At first bite, cookies 'n cream donut was pretty good, but then I became overwhelmed with the filling. I have a huge sweet tooth - not even I could handle all the sugary whipped mass stuffed inside that donut. My final analysis? Cookies n' cream was all cream, no donut. I'll probably go back to Pink Box for another round, but I won't be getting anything that's cream or jelly filled!\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #184"

Voodoo takes good donuts and puts interesting toppings on them, Pink Box takes good donuts and puts interesting things on and IN them! I am fortunate enough to live right down the street so I've tried quite a few things. I also routinely pick up a dozen on my way to work, just give me a reason to bring them in! Here are a few of my favorites:\n\nFritters! They have apple and cherry! The cherry are SO good, but I've only seen them a couple of times. \n\nKey Lime Pie - This delicious morsel has homemade whipped cream on top and is filled with the limiest of lime fillings. SO good!\n\nLemon filled - This glazed beauty has lemony goodness stuffed inside. If you are a fan of lemon, this is the donut for you.\n\nS'mores - Brulee'd marshmallow cream is on top of this chocolate covered marshmallow cream filled little cloud. \n\nCheesecake - Chocolate covered and filled with delicious cream cheese cheesecake filling.\n\nNow, get out of your house and go...seriously GO...I'll wait...\n\nYou can thank me later!"

I finally caved in, and I've been a repeat customers since. What makes Pink Box better than the typical doughnut shop is that they have gourmet doughnuts. They have the Elvis doughnut which you've guessed it...peanut butter and banana. They also have bacon donuts, and a new one I've discovered....pink velvet. Pumpkin cheesecake and pumpkin cream are new, and probably only seasonal. My favorite was the green tea donut, but that has been discontinued. \n\nThe doughnuts are light and fluffy...similar to Krispy Kreme but not as sweet. \n\nThe only thing I do not like about Pink Box is that they do not have a location in Los Angeles, or anywhere outside of Las Vegas."

We all love our sweets but can control ourselves...kind of.  None of us wanted to eat a whole doughnut, but let me clarify:  we all wanted some of each one!!  We cut each one into fours (halves if filled) and then we would snag a piece here and there all day long.  Yup, I am full of doughnuts today!!\n\nSo first off the cake doughnuts are freaking awesome-I do tend to lean towards a cake doughnut when choosing-A great crunch and not overly sweet.  We had plain cake with chocolate frosting-yum, chocolate with chocolate frosting-meh, chocolate with chocolate frosting with almonds-yum yum, plain cake with pink frosting and sprinkles and with coconut-these were my favies, raised cake filled lemon-the lemon is from real lemons and good but did not care for the raised itself, raised filled with whip cream-again filling is good but I don't care for the raised, and the Bavarian Cream filled was another raised and I had had enough of those although the cream was really yummy.\n\nAll in all, I thought they were really good and the price is great as well.

The donuts looked amazing and I couldn't make up mind and choose one so I got a whole dozen.\n\nBy ordering a dozen, I was able to try a few of their popular picks: thin mint (Girl Scout cookies), crunch (cereal) bar, green tea with rice crisp on top (seasonal), cheesecake, cronuts (crossaint meets donuts), maple bars, raspberry filled sugar donuts, and s'mores. Although all of the ones I have tried have been amazing my favorites have to be the Caramel Cheesecake and the seasonal Green Tea Donuts and Ofcourse the Cronuts! \n\nI love and hate that they are open 24 hours! I love that I can go at anytime of the day that I am craving them and hate it because ever since I have found this place have been going every other day! Haha"

My husband still preferred the apple fritters at other Vegas establishments (e.g. Ace Doughnuts), but he ended up liking their old fashioned glazed and I was really happy with my regular glazed doughnut and cronut - both were moist and not overly sweet. They are known for their over the top doughnuts, but it's nice to know they can delivery on the simple things too."

The texture is definitely not as soft 'n fluffy as I expected upon my first visit here. with that said...\n\nI do love the inventive flavors that they create on a daily basis. How many places can you find a donut filled with blue cheese among other creations? How about real raspberries for a \"jelly filled\" or campfire s'mores with gooey marshmellow goodness? \n\nBefore you consider going elsewhere, give this Pink Box location a break and try more flavors! Until you've had at least 5 different varieties then your opinion shouldn't rule the entire menu. One of my absolute favorites is the simplicity of the glaze. Yummy!\n\nAffordably priced, they also serve coffee & bottled beverages, and the employees are cool, too. Watch for the owner in his signature styles that have a 70s vibe and retro flare... hehe!"

As I made my way up the line, I was able to see what they had in store for me. Beautiful gourmet donuts that I have only seen in my friends' pictures in other cities. I was excited to try them all, but since I don't have much of a sweet tooth, I opted for a half dozen ($8.50 for 5 gourmet donuts and 1 specialty). \n\nCronut: made fresh at 9am. The owner said they're trying to find a way to make them earlier, but I'm not complaining. I can't wake up that early anyway.  I wasn't sure what to expect at first. A croissant-donut? They're a bit smaller compared to the donuts, but the taste was killer! It was sweet on the outside from the glaze, but savory on the inside. The pastry was flakey on top, and fluffy and moist on the inside. I loved everything about it! \n\nMaple bacon bar: a maple bar with bits of cooked bacon on top. It's sweet and savory. I wish the bacon was candied. It would've been more epic \n\nNutty pig: similar to the maple bacon bar, with extra trimmings. It had bleu cheese, thinly toasted almonds, filling in the middle, and candied bacon. It was pretty tasty, not too sweet for me. \n\nApple pie donut (?): regular donut with baked apple on top, apple pie filling inside the donut hole, drizzled with caramel and topped with whipped cream. It tasted exactly like an apple pie, and a little too sweet for my taste. \n\nThe CRONUT was the star of my Pink Box experience. I would definitely come back for a dozen of those bad boys. \n\nThe donuts looked beautiful and didn't lack in flavor. It's great for people who love sweets! They're just a little too sweet for me."

Too often that excitement is quelled by finding the same offerings as the last new place I went to which had the same options as the one before it etc... Pink Box Doughnuts was an exception. There were so many different flavors and styles when I visited here. \n\nThe flavor of the day was a Chipotle Caramel Glazed Doughnut. A perfect blend of spicy and sweet. I got there kind of late in the day so I was fortunate to get the last one. That should doughnut be static IMO.\n\nAnother rock star was the Strawberry Shortcake. Fresh tasty berries with a dollop of sweet cream and a nice glaze drizzle but not overly sweet. Just the right amount of toppings to get all the flavors in every bite but not get it all over your shirt.\n\nPink Box Doughnuts is definitely worth the drive across town for me."

I'm sure when it gets a little busy the line easily goes out the door. There is not that much room in the store. They do have a few tables outside if you choose to stay there and eat your donuts. The girl behind the counter was very nice and helpful while we were making our selections.\n\nSo there is a large selection of specialty donuts. We decided to get a dozen and sample them all. I will say before I go any further with this review that none of the donuts tasted like they were freshly made and I was there at 7 am. I rated them from I did not care for to Excellent.\n\n-Maple Bar - Good. Very sweet.\n\n-Fat Elvis - I did not care for. Peanut Butter and bananas in a donut.

In fact I will only eat maple bars from Sluy's Bakery, but Pink Box was able to hold a candle to Sluy's maple bar and that is saying a lot!!! Pink Box has a lot of giant specialty donuts that are jam packed with fillings such as PB and bananas, which they call the Fat Elvis. But I am more a fan of the so called regular donuts rather than the stuffed specialties. I think my favorite would have to be the Fruit Loop Cereal Bar. \nNo matter what your pleasure, they make their donuts fresh daily and they serve them up with a smile and they are miles ahead of Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts as far as taste, variety and freshness!"

The doughnuts are even more delicious than the Lake mead location. Why you ask? Because I don't have to drive as far. \n\n They will be opening a drive thru in 2 weeks. I can't wait.

Walk right up to the Pink Box counter next to the Roberto's window inside the Fabulous Freddy's Food Court (not an official name, but this is more of a convenience plaza than a convenience store) and select from the most elaborate variety of fried dough creations in town. My pick is an apple pie fritter and a cup of fresh-brewed Sumatra coffee. This location is only a slightly closer drive than the Lake Mead store, but the parking situation is more friendly here. The doughnut drive-thru should be operational within the next few weeks. When you're driving up to Mt. Charleston, this is an ideal stop to stock up on caffeine, supplies, and sugar."

I walked up to the counter unsure of what to get and took a few minutes to study the various selections. They all looked pretty amazing and fancy. At this point it was pretty obvious that it was my first time here, so I asked the girls at the counter what they recommended. They told me that they were all delicious but that the maple bacon bar was pretty popular, so I opted for that one. Since it was my first time here I was offered a complimentary doughnut on the house, so I decided to try the key lime as well.\n\nThe key lime was a glazed doughnut filled with key lime and topped with whipped cream and more key lime. It was tasty and not overly sweet...tasted just like a pie, just with softer consistency. The maple bacon bar was a glazed maple doughnut bar topped with bacon. It was absolutely delicious, with a good mix of sweet and savory notes, and the maple and bacon flavors go surprisingly well together.\n\nI tried their coffee as well, and opted for the vanilla one which was so good and much better than other vanilla coffee that I've had elsewhere, probably because this one wasn't added as an artificial flavoring.\n\nI am definitely looking forward to coming back here to try all their gourmet doughnuts since they all looked so awesome and appetizing. In the next few weeks, they'll be going to a 24/7 schedule as well, which will make it that much more convenient to fill your doughnut cravings anytime."

This location is inside the Fabulous Freddy's so it does get pretty busy sometimes. I could be wrong but I believe all the donuts are brought over from the main store too, so some of the popular stuff seems to run out quickly. \n\nAs far as the donuts go, Pink Box offers a spectacular product! They are always fresh and super soft. Even If I tried, I wouldn't know where to start on trying to figure out what's my favorite. The cheesecake varieties are amazing and if you like filled donuts, my wife swears they make the best raspberry filled in town. Even if you just want a classic style donut, their chocolates, glazed and blueberry donuts are delicious too. But you can't forget about the \"gourmet\" options...everything I've tried from the Fat Elvis to the S'mores are beyond good. And if it's your first time, you can't leave without trying a maple bacon bar! \n\nWhen the original location opened up last year, we tried them a few times and just never had a good experience. That was quite a while ago though and they have really got a good thing going on now. Pink Box is quickly becoming one of my favorites! It doesn't even have to be a breakfast thing either, I'm down for a banana cream pie donut pretty much 24/7! ;)"

I would dare say they are just as good as my frequent visits to Voodoo. Wacky flavor combos include Bacon Maple Bar - Fat Elvis - Key Lime Pie- and all sorts of other off the wall concoctions. Bacon + Doughnuts- really? It works. \n\nWhen we went to pick up the 2 dozen for an office party earlier this year - we truly couldn't decide on what we wanted. The gal working the counter eagerly helped pick out a variety for my office party to accommodate everyone. She defiantly provided a solid sampling of several different styles and tastes (jelly/cream filled and your traditional cake style doughnuts). As I suspected, they were a big hit in the office. \n\nAs I mentioned above, these are fun to pick up for clients or coworkers. My coworker stopped by my desk today and was asking about them - which prompted my review. We were scoping out their Instagram page and the craving hit us.  I will be swinging by tomorrow to pick up Christmas treats for the office. No Christmas cards needed- pass out Doughnuts and weasel your way into being the office sweetheart ;).\n\nWe want to sample their seasonal doughnuts - which at the moment includes Eggnog--  A Santa face doughnut - A Reindeer doughnut- and candy cane doughnut- all that will delight kids and adults alike.  It's something unexpected and my coworkers go BANANAS for them. I can't wait to try their new flavors and will post updated pics at that time. \n\nIt is always fun to watch everyone sample difference flavors and enjoy learning about which doughnut was what. Clearly, I'm a fan and would suggest giving them a whirl to curb your sweet tooth when it strikes!"

Now if you read my reviews I rarely slam a business, but I have to say that their business structure kinda sucks. \n\nThey're open until 5 or until they sell out. They're always sold out.  I come here weekly because my grandma in law likes to eat the same foods often so we're at Robertos 1-3 times a week. After work we often stop around 4pm-430pm to get her meal and I've not once caught them open. \n\nI feel if you are selling out so fast that you dont make it to closing perhaps have more donuts. My first review was back from when they were brand new. Since then I haven't been able to catch them open, even once stopping in at 3pm and no success. So next time went in early to find them open, but disappointed that all they had were a tiny amount of all the basics, none of to gourmet flavors and it was only noon on a weekday. My MIL made a special stop with me on a dayoff early and that was the only successful trip after many failed trips. After that my MIL gone to pick up grandmas order for lunch and to be nice said she tried to get me maple bacon bars and they didnt have any. Today went in to find them closed, again. I really wish it wasn't like this, but I've made more than enough attempts to try to give them business within their stated business hours. \n\nBeing open 24 hours makes sense considering they are in a 24 hour gas station with 24 hour Mexican food. If they were, I know we would be buying a ton of donuts as my house is full of people who like donuts. I know others would too as I kid you not Ive heard others bitching about it while I'm waiting for my Robertos order.\n\nI have a hard time figuring out what to rate them but I won't be trying to stop in for donuts anymore.

Without a doubt the most trendy doughnuttery in town it was with some restraint that I opted for a half-dozen +1 and at a $10 tally the majority of selections were saved for NFL game time snacking, the exceptions being a still-warm $2.25 take on Dominique Ansel's 'Cronut' that unfortunately proved oily, flaccid, and uninspired plus the cocoa-laden pink velvet whose hefty chocolate notes found needed levity in rich, though overly sweet, cream cheese.  Moving onward to the rest, much like other quirky \"Voodoo inspired\" shops across the country standards like the blueberry cake and buttermilk bar proved above average while novelties stole the spotlight, each filled option featuring natural ingredients and both the banana pudding and key lime gel spot-on representations of the iconic pie fillings inside a fluffy leavened pocket.  A mixed experience to be sure and a prime example of why places of its ilk rarely appeal to purists I personally look forward to seeing how the company evolves over time...hopefully a bit less cronut/bacon/cereal 'me too' in favor of more ambitious 'outside the box' thinking a la the Nutty Pig, Salted Caramel Twist, and Cream pies."

I read a lot of mixed reviews about this place and decided to try it for myself. I got the coco loco donut, which is the one with cocoa pebbles on top, and a maple bacon bar. I ate the coco loco one first and although the actual donut was a perfect consistency, the cocoa pebbles on top were stale. I would have enjoyed that so much better if the cereal was as fresh as the doughnut. And as far as the maple bacon bar, again the donut part was good but the bacon on top was so hard I couldn't even chew it, and I couldn't even make it half way through that doughnut before just throwing it away.

There is also a Roberto's inside right next to Pink Box. I passed the window for Roberto's and felt sorry for the guy just standing there hoping someone would order a breakfast burrito, but instead the line was at Pink Box. Since this PB is located inside a convenient store, it's not as big as some of their other locations and they don't make any of the doughnuts here. The doughnuts are made fresh at the Lake Mead location and brought over. I really didn't think they would be as sold out as they were when I arrived just after 7 am, but the selection was limited. and as I mentioned previously there was a line, so they were busy. I wish they would bring doughnuts over to this location more often or at least more often in the morning when they are clearly busy. I picked up a half dozen and she charged me $6.50 which isn't bad for 6 donuts that are way better than average. Half dozen runs between $6.50 - $9.50 and a full dozen between $9 - $14 just depending on which types of doughnuts you choose. \n\nDate with a Nutty Pig - dates, almonds, blue cheese, icing, yep... this is all happening. I've seen it several times at the Lake Mead PB where I usually frequent. I like everything that comes on the doughnut, I just always thought it all seemed weird together on a doughnut and overlooked trying it. Since the selection was so limited, I went ahead and tried it. I can't say I'd order it often, but it wasn't bad and I'm glad I actually tried it. \n\nBlue Doughnut with Sprinkles - Pretty basic and done nicely. It kind of reminded me of a doughnut Homer Simpson would eat. \n\nBlueberry Cake - Major fail. This is time it didn't live up to the many I have previously consumed from PB. This one was really heavy and had a burnt taste to it. \n\nApple Fritter - Still haven't found one better than the one at Friendly's in Henderson. The apple fritter I had here was delicious, but there was only a small pile of apples in the middle instead of throughout. I didn't care for that even though the fritter wasn't greasy at all and texture wise it was perfect. I'd rather have apples with each bite instead of a glob in the center. \n\nChocolate Bar - Simple yet done just right. The bar was soft and fresh and It had the right amount of chocolate on the top and I liked the taste of the chocolate. \n\nVanilla Sugar - Another simple doughnut yet tasty. It was soft and fresh."

If they wanted to sell doughnuts, wouldn't you think they would be able to better estimate how many they need to not sell out before 9:00 am?  Not everyone goes for doughnuts at 6:00 am on Saturdays, people."

People get mad because you can't resist a doughnut...especially on a Friday. \n\nI've been going to the same Ma & Pop place down the street. I still go there...but there is something about Pink Box that is just so luring...oh, yes. It's the gourmet specialty doughnuts. Just look at the pictures.\n\nThe service is always so good here. The girls that are usually working are such sweethearts and very quick to help. \n\nLove this place!!"

            "review": "The experience here has been varying as of late. Sometimes, the doughnuts are immaculately put together. When done right, they're delicious, nearly flawless. They blow the mind. Increasingly, quality has been slipping. Under-cooked, too much frosting, next to no filling, sloppy toppings... it makes a big difference. I don't know if they're having trouble keeping up with demand or they're putting amateurs in charge of the bake, but the number of disappointing visits is starting to out-weigh the good ones. Lake Mead location included. They've even messed up the math on my orders a couple of times.\n\nThe stock seems to always be depleted unless you hit them at just the right time. It makes me wonder if they can handle the boom in popularity. Still, I give them the benefit of the doubt. The original group makes a mean batch of doughnuts. It's just not so much of a sure thing now."
