About an hour in I saw a cockroach larger than the length of my thumb crawling on the ceiling. I'm talking a Florida sized roach. We had the waitress come take a look and she was like, \"oh, they just crawl back in wherever they came from.\" What?!? This apparently is just a normal occurrence there. It wound up crawling in a little hole near the wooden beams but poked its head out occasionally. And there were also two crickets that were crawling around the beams as well. We got our checks and got out of there.\n\nI would never eat in this establishment nor will I ever be back for drinks. Gross."

            "review": "I don't want to sound like a zealot but this establishment should be in the best of Las Vegas.  It has character and it is fairly decently priced when it comes to Las Vegas as Vegas is pretty pricey in and around the Strip area, when it comes to food and drink. I have been to the Crown and Anchor Pub twice and I must say that I have enjoyed it both times. I had a beer there that I cannot place but it was bitter yet sweet and all in all terrific. One of the most important things about The Crown and Anchor is that it has an authenticity and feel that is lacking in most Las Vegas establishments. This alone makes it a good place to visit. As an addendum I would like to add that the chips served at The Crown and Anchor Bar are great. Also my friend and couldn't help commenting on the fact that our server was quite attractive. So there is eye candy at The Crown and Anchor as well."

They even have this promotion going on where they give you a punch card and you get it punched once for every country you buy a pint from. After 30 punches you get a t-shirt. They neglected to tell me that it needn't be in one night. I am unsure if I got the t-shirt. \n\nI have been here several times other than that faithfull night. I have enjoyed breakfast, simple but solid english breakfast. Lunch and diner were top notch. The bangers and mashare at least as good as my usualpub on Maui. \n\nThe kicker is the waitstaff. They always make you feel like a regular. The service at either the tables, the patio, and the bar rivals some of the better establishments on the strip. The naughty schoolgirl thing never hurts either.\n\nGo early in the morning, order a red eye with draught Boddingtons never fails to start the day off right."

Didn't feel very clean & the chairs had rips in them, the server was working her ass off, she had a huge table she was working on plus us and a few others tables. The wait could have been better. I ordered a coke, it was flat. I ordered the British Burger which I have to say was delicious. Very flavorful & filling. My friend got the pulled pork sliders and she loved them as well. In closing, food is good, service could be better & the dining room could use a little sprucing up."

A great menu, darts and patio dining.  The uni's the waitresses wear are pretty hot too!  But the best part (IMHO) is they play ESPN World on the several TVs scattered around.

The potato skins though are pretty good.\n\nThey have a wide variety of beers to choose from, as well as hard liquor. However, you have to remember that you cannot order hard liquor at the bar, only beer. I prefer a Smithwicks, but next time I go in, I want to try something different. That is what I like about variety, so many choices, which means so many reasons to go back! \n\nThey really do not have a daily happy hour, but they have theme nights. Like Thursday is Pub Quiz, you answer ten questions and the winner wins like a $50 bar tab or something along those lines. Our team did not win last night, bummer. They also have $1 draft Sundays at night. \n\nIt is a cool place, nothing extraordinary though. Our waitress was hot, but she was a ditz for sure. She forgot all our orders at one point in time and kept forgetting to place them. I guess it has its days of being cool and \nlame. It is also awkward when your philosophy professor just so happens to be getting drunk in the same place you are. Got to love this place for the attraction of UNLV faculty."

Went inside stood at the desk and waited a long time. I was about to give up when the bartender acknowledged me. I then noticed the cocktail waitress was in deep conversation with someone at the bar while I waited. The beef dip was plain. Light in protein. The au-jus was good but too salty. The chips were good. I'll stick with my initial impression. I'll avoid it unless out for a good beer."

            "review": "I really love this place! It's not your fancy shmancy martini glass bar. It's a beer and darts kind of place with surprisingly really good food! The bartenders and servers we have had are all friendly. \n\nCrown & Anchor is located down the street from UNLV. The outside is well lit and easy to find. At the bar, you can only order beer. The pool table and darts are also located on the bar side. But in the separate dining area, you can order food and spirits. This is due to their grandfathered liquor license. Not a big deal for me, but it just sucks when your party is eating in the dining area, everyone has to migrate over to the other side if they want to play darts. They also have karaoke on Wednesday nights. If it wasn't for the place being a little smokey, this would have gotten 5 stars from me.\n\nAs for the food, everything we have tried has been delicious. My favorite thing so far has been the fish and chips. The fish is flaky and moist with a nice crunchy breading. The French fries are hot and crispy. And you know how I know the food is good here? I usually hate peas, like literally hate peas. The fish and chips come with a side of peas and they are freaking delicious! They aren't mushy at all. I ate the whole bowl. \n\nIf you're looking for a chill place to have drink and eat, you should definitely check it out."

While that may be true in the UK, it certainly isn't the case, here.\n\nI don't get over to this place as much as I would like, and that's MY loss, because every time I dine here, I'm never disappointed.  In fact, a fraternal/social group to which I belong, used to meet here every Friday night, about 10+ years ago.  We had most of the upstairs section to ourselves.\n\nI can recommend almost everything on the menu, as at one time or another, I've sampled most of the fare offered.  I treated a total of 5 of my good friends there on June 13, 2012, and the total price for all 6 of us was under $100, so their charges are certainly reasonable.\n\nBut best of all, if I may be permtted a totally MALE observation, I definitely noticed the delightfully (and incredibly) SHORT Scottish kilts being worn by the female servers.\n\nNo joking guys, they all have LEGS TO DIE FOR."

A couple buddies and me sat at the bar and the bartender came over and informed us that sunday was 1$ PBR night. Well I was looking forward to a Stella or a Bass, but dam, 1 dollar pbr. So I had a couple of those, we also had some of the homemade potato chips and an order of wings.  The potato chips were really thin and broke easily in the curry which could of had a little more flavor.  The wings were decent, kind of your average bar wings. I'd have to give a low rating on the food, but honestly we only tried those two things and nothing off their traditional menu. I will definitely be back to try those becuase the bartender was really nice. He got our orders right, engaged in a bit of small talk, was able to answer questions I had about their happy hour and offered a sample of Bombadier when I asked what kind of beer it was, having never seen it before. \n\nThe decor is pretty standard, pictures and UK beer decals. They have a little cove for darts and what sounded like a billards table upstairs. They have a board with all their sports offerings, and special events like karaoke and trivia.  So I will definitely be back for some pints, hopefully of something better next time, but cmon 1 dollar is 1 dollar, amirite?"

Showing my husband and I your cooch won't get you better tips, wrong venue for this.

Maybe I just wasn't paying as much attention?\n\nBoth the hubs and I ordered the fish and chips. We didn't notice until after our meal that Monday's (when we went) are all you can eat fish and chips. I guess that's why the server asked if we'd like another order of fish, but it wasn't made clear that it was a special. Partly our bad for not checking the specials, but also poor service for not informing your customers of the special. \n\nI wasn't overly impressed. The steak fries were decent, though not cooked enough for me. I like a little bit of crunch in my fries, not a mouth full of mush. I guess they thought they'd make up for it in my fish? My first piece of fish was SOOOOO overcooked that there was no resemblance of actual fish in about half of the piece. All the meat was so crispy, I seriously thought it was all breading - until I took a closer look. I could have complained and asked for another piece of fish... had we had anything that resembled service. \n\nI guess I would probably go back sometime to see if anything has changed (I enjoyed the chicken curry the last time I was there - ages ago)... but it's not high on my list of places to spend my hard earned money."

They do have a cover charge on occasion; I guess that is for pay per view games or something.\n\nOn those occasions when I'm a crappy vegetarian and eat fish (I admit it), the fish and chips here are the best I've had in Las Vegas."

I enjoy a good beer on tap, or a strong mix drink, but there are many places down Maryland that will offer me that. The food is ok, but nothing to rave about. The fish and chips are a crowd favorite, especially during nights when they do the AYCE. I have tried it once and can only do one plate because it is oil laden. I understand that you cannot expect fried food to be grease free, but a good batter and proper prep should leave you with minimum saturation. The generous pieces of flaky fish are moist and flavorful. After stripping the batter, the meal was more enjoyable. The lightly breaded chicken strips are great since I am not a fan of a thick coating. Nothing kills a good strip more than biting into a strip and getting predominantly breading.\n\nThe staff has always been friendly and attentive. Sometimes the male bartender would overlook me for female patrons, but it is not a big deal."

This was the place she chose, as we were NOT going to eat on the Strip another time.  \n\nWe stopped at Crown & Anchor.  First of all, let me say that I was impressed with the decor.  Being that I have been in London, it was pretty \"accurate\" with the Pub vibe.\n\nService was A BIT SLOW, and they were NOT that busy.  However, this seems to be a recurring factor in Vegas.  No one seems to move.  Maybe it is just that I am from the NYC area and like things promptly.\n\nWe all ordered salads.  The salads, I must say, are pretty dang tasty for rabbit food.  I was really impressed with it.  The chicken was cooked to perfection and the english dressing was fantabulous.  Prices were NOT that bad.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place, if you have some time to kill & are NOT in a rush to get in, grab something to eat, and run."

You can even sit out on the patio and bring your pup!  \n\nThere are 30 beers and ciders on tap and the majority of the selection is great. *Cough cough Miller cough*  Sorry, excuse me.  My personal favorite is Blackthorn Cider.  If you're feeling adventurous you can ask them about their \"Down the Hatch\" club. (Hint: you get a prize for trying all the drafts.  I've got 29 more to go).  \n\nThe seats at the bar fill quickly, but there are some tables nearby.  The smoke isn't too bad, but then again, I haven't been there when it's really crowded.  Please don't hate me if you inhale a pack of cigarettes on a Friday night.  And while the bartenders are attentive, they aren't super friendly.  I'm going to go ahead and say it's because they are uncomfortable in the ridiculous outfits they have to wear.\n\nYou can order from the menu at the bar which might be a good idea if you plan on having more than a couple pints.  Being British food it's not vegetarian friendly, so keep that in mind, my veg friends.  My husband has ordered the Chip Butty which is literally a French fry sandwich.  He likes it and I like to pick at his leftover chips.  They do offer a veggie burger but I just don't feel right eating it in a pub.  For the non-vegetarians, expect Fish and Chips, Bangers and Mash, and various meat pies.\n\nPlease be aware that they have lots of rules about what kind of alcohol you can drink at the bar/restaurant/patio.  \n\nDefinitely a fun place to stop for a drink!  And it's right next to Pinball Hall of Fame- bonus!\n\nNikki Jo's Ladies Restroom Review:\nWhile it's clean, I don't like this restroom due to the creep-factor.  They leave the window open (I'm guessing for circulation) but it opens up right next to the employee outdoor break area.  I didn't have luck closing it but that's probably more due to the fact that I was a spazz and had a couple ciders already.  Instead, I covered it up as best as I could with my purse.  Regardless of whether or not it's closed, there is only a lace curtain covering the window ready for any perv to look through.  Not cool."

I'm not sure if our bartender was having a bad day or if I smelled (hopefully I didn't smell since I showered and put deodorant on before going out!) but when my friend asked what was on draft our bartender all but threw the menu down. Yes the beer names were on the tap handles but we were sitting far away and couldn't see! Sorry? I didn't have a stopwatch going but it took him a little while to come back to us. After we got our beer he went back to munching on the plate of food he had. Never asked us if we wanted food (thankfully we had come from dinner) or if there was anything else he could get us. If you walked up to him and asked him how we were doing or what brought us in, he literally couldn't tell you because he never asked. I understand that you get hungry in the middle of your shift but eat in the back on your break, not out on the floor in front of customers. Eating out on the floor doesn't look professional at all and I'm not sure if he washed his hands after eating which is why I didn't order another beer. Once our bartender was done with his food is when he started schmoozing with what seemed like his regulars. Which was fine. But in order for a business to succeed you need many paying customers, not just a couple regulars. Overall the guy working behind the bar was a good drink pour and delivery guy, but he wasn't being a bartender. When the graveyard bartender came in is when my friend decided to order another beer. \nOverall, I have very little tolerance for bad customer service, especially since I work in guest services at a hotel on the strip. Will I return? I'm on the fence. \nI gave 2 stars, 1 for my beer being nice and cold and 1 for the graveyard bartender (usually I catch names but it slipped my mind tonight!) who seemed to have a significantly better attitude. Will I return? Maybe but if the same bartender is working when I walk in I will be walking right out. I don't want to feel like an inconvenience and that's how my friend and I felt tonight."

Either it came from upstairs or was crawling on the ceiling, I don't know for sure. We moved to a different table and the waitress brought our drinks and asked if we saw another cricket, we told her what happened and she looked horrified. She apologized and told us that they spray the place once every two weeks. I told her it was okay. When she left I saw two more roaches. One crawling on the wall behind my boyfriend and one underneath the table next to us, barely alive. \n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to leave, we didn't feel comfortable eating there anymore. We asked if we could just pay for the drinks instead. She understood and asked if we would like our food to go but we said \"No thank you.\" She said we didn't have to pay for the drinks.

Don't come for the food, come here for the drinks. They have so many beers on tap, they have made it into a game. If you decide you want to keep coming back (because you won't finish all in one sitting) then ask for a beer card. There are approximately thirty beers on the card, and you get a stamp for every one you try. The only stipulation is that you cannot try a beer twice. It has to be thirty different beers. I made the mistake of mixing light ales with dark lagers with who knows what else one night to try to fill up my card, and it ended in, well, a mess, if you will. Anyway, it is such a fun place to be (we chose Tuesday nights for our weekly get together) and after dining hours settle, it gets a bit louder, and livelier. Crown and Anchor is the best place around UNLV for groups to get together in a casual atmosphere for fun conversations and drinking. Be careful though. You can get tipsy pretty fast, and nobody wants an accident to happen. We always designate a driver (which always seems to be the party pooper since they cant join in on the debauchery, hehe) and the police always seem to be about. Crown and Anchor is so much fun, but have good fun, be safe!\n\nRecommended drink: The beers on the card. Have your server recommend an order, don't just choose or you will end up in the bathroom all night!\n\nRecommended company: Because it is loud and filled with students, I suggest bringing your own group of loud students to add to the mix!"

Fish 'N' Chips and a Scotch Egg?  Good times = me.\n\nIt's fun to watch the game, play a few tunes in the jukebox, or even hang out in their upstairs area (there was a lightning storm last night, which made the whole atmosphere awesome).  I've even been accosted by a group of friendly Elvis impersonators there, of which I will definitely rate that particular experience: \"A hoot\".\n\nAll they need to do is run the recent Doctor Who episodes, and I'm set.\n\nRecommended."

Toilets could do with a air freshener ( gents) but very friendly atmosphere food and drink great and great price, we are gay and was made to feel welcome, there is Dart boards, TV, Video Poker at the Bar, they do specials all week long, its open 24/7 if your in Las Vegas this is a must come and visit. for British people coming in the USA bar staff and waitresses work for their tips as that is there wage, general rule, when you buy a drink leave a $1 tip per drink, for food leave 20% tip example if your bill is say $50 times the 5 by 2 = $10 there is the tip, if $100 $10-20 if the normal, plus if you like great service next time you go back leave a tip, but the tips is their wage!  we Like this bar and we will be back as we live around the corner. would recommend to every one!"

The main problem in our city is that every pub ruins its ambiance by installing those damn video poker machines in the bar.  And part of the greatness of a pub is a spacious wooden bar (uncluttered by anything except empty pints). So in Vegas, we already start a star down (try resting your elbow on the bar with those blocky video poker machines in the way).\n\nBut when you lower the bar for Vegas, Crown & Anchor is an excellent choice.  They have a solid selection of British, Irish and American beers and a decent whiskey collection.  Add in a nice dart board and a solid crowd of good-humored patrons.  Head there for a big soccer match or rugby match and you'll find a nice batch of rowdy fans yelling at a television.  It's comfortable and fun, with tasty fried food and drinks.  What you'd expect from a good pub.\n\nAnd there are some advantages to drinking in a Vegas pub.  Like all successful Vegas businesses, Crown & Anchor has perfected the art of hiring sexy wait staff.  The staff is very easy on the eyes and a vast improvement from the brown teeth and rolly-polly figure you'd find in jolly ol' England."

Well I received the following message today from Rob the bartender, I've also added a photo just incase he tries to deny the exact verbage:\n\nI really don't appreciate you attacking me personally and using my name in your review! I am not a degenerate and I don't care for your roid rage comment. You see I recognize your picture and I realize that customers get jealous of the way I look and feel the need to knock me with their roid rage comments, but I understand. Maybe the next time we run into each other you can explain the roid rage and degenerate comment! Look forward to seeing you.\n\nWOW talk about customer service at its finest! Now I definitely will not EVER return. And I will make sure I let all of my friends/yelp followers of this experience. \n\n\n\nPREVIOUS REVIEW:It literally pains me to give a 2 star review but our service the past 4ish times have been utterly unacceptable. We tend to stay clear from the bar because the bartender Rob is such a degenerate mess. He is constantly gambling, slamming the machines, and going on a full roid rage. He's even broken machines before by slamming his fists on them after losing. All while bartending mind you. \n\nSo we choose to sit in the restaurant area. I'm not sure why the waitresses just can't get it together,  but waiting 20+ minutes for a side of BBQ sauce, then another 20+ minutes for our bill is rediculous. Don't even get me started on how long the drinks take.. tonight was an utter disaster. The ending was the cherry on top to a horrible experience  when the waitress disappeared with our credit card. When we couldn't find her I went to a tall blonde waitress and asked if she could possibly locate our credit card so we could leave. Before I even got the chance to finish my sentence she cut me off and said \"do you just want to talk to a manager?\" I said no, I just wanted to pay our bill. She stormed off and we never saw her again. Our waitress eventually came back but this turned into an almost 30 minute ordeal. \n\nLike I said it pains me to give such a bad review, the food is amazing (especially the fish n chips) and they have a great beer selection and we've been going to this bar for years. But the service just can't be tolerated any longer. I really hope this gets noticed by management because I would hate to see this awesome place go under."

I came here a few times when I was in college at UNLV (back in the day, I remember how small it was- small parking lot too- and that it was busting at the seams- another location opened near Chinatown BTW). Our most recent visit was when a good friend was moving to another state- it's her favorite bar. I didn't eat- it was a little too late for me. A couple of our friends did and their food looked good. I did sample a few fries. We had a couple drinks while remembering all the good times. The server was really nice and came around often, checking on us. Since it was wednesday night, it was karaoke night- which made it more fun- it's great hearing people perform- some people are so animated. We hung out for a few hours. There was a good crowd but it wasn't as crowded as it would be on a weekend, I imagine. \n\nI am interested in trying the fish and chips sometime, since I hear that it is a specialty of theirs- being an authentic British pub and all. The atmosphere is rich dark woods and heavy furniture (chairs). It is a little dark inside too.  \n\nJust a note, be careful with the step on the way (from the front of the bar to the other side of the bar, on the way to the bathroom, I totally missed it and fell! I was ok, though, just a little embarassed, but not sure many people even noticed it."

I ordered the fish and chips, which came with baked beans and \"fresh\" peas, and my friend ordered a lamb stew with yorkshire pudding.  Sounds tasty, huh?  Keep reading...  \n\nWell, the fish was NOT seasoned at all.  Although the crust was crunchy, the cod fillet was drenched in grease.  Next, the baked beans were flavorless and obviously canned.  Finally,  my peas tasted like they were once frozen, but they had an old, dry and starchy taste.  They, too were not seasoned at all.  In the end, if you like fried fish, I would recommend FRESHLY prepared Long John SIlvers to this...OR even visiting the \"hole in the wall\" in Northtown called Marios Market (MLK/Lake Mead).  The catfish there is AMAZING and made with love.\n\nNow, my friend ordered the lamb stew prepared in a yorkshire pudding bowl.  Would you believe the stew was NOT lamb, but BEEF (my friend is a trained chef...he knows!)  ANYONE who eats lamb can recognise its distinctive, slightly gamey flavor).   And when it arrived at the table in the yorkshire pudding bowl, the stew was cool inside the bowl...as if the \"chef\" hadn't microwaved it long enough.  Really?!  How long had THAT been sitting around!  Even the yorkshire pudding was soggy and old, like it was made a few days ago.\n\nSo, when we informed the waitress that the stew contained beef instead of lamb, she trotted off, frustrated, and returned 15 minutes later and said...\"Yep...the chef says it's lamb.  YOU can SAY it's beef all day long...but I'M TELLING you it's lamb.\"  When I asked her if she had ever eaten lamb before, she responded \"No...I don't like stuff like that.  But the chef told me the stew was made with lamb.\"  Hmmm.\n\nThe waitress then grew rude and condescending, as if she was exasperated by our inquiries.  At least she replaced my friend's \"lamb\" stew with a dry, overcooked steak sandwich, which was again unseasoned.  Some \"chef\" they have at the Crown & Anchor, huh?!\n\nWhat's most disappointing about my experience at the Crown & Anchor British Pub was that I'd been wanting to visit this place for some time now.  I love fish and chips, and I've seen theirs touted as being so delicious.  Hogwash!  They must be paying people to post those comments.\n\nI would NEVER go there again...or recommend any friend to do so either.  It was a 2 on a scale of 1-10.  What a waste of time and money."

I am typically there with my family including grandchildren.\nJust inappropriate !

Strike 2- almost 40 minutes later for my food to come out and I watch as the now off duty bartender gets served his food first, this after he ordered his meal 20 minutes after mine. Strike 3 food arrives and I'm given an excuse that there was a large table that ordered before me; there's only 1 other table ordering food in this whole place. The strike is because of course my meal is cold! The bun was toasted a long time ago and since dried out and the chicken tasted of burnt grill and is dried out. The bartender saw my disgust and offered to refire me a new one. Miraculously a new hot fresh sandwich and fries arrived in under 2 minutes and am told oh yea the cook said your original order may not have been right..... The refire is hot, fresh and tasty but unfortunately my rating still stands because of the 3 strikes. I did get an apology and handshake from the bartender on my way and that speaks for a lot but I can't get over all of the above."

The beer is a little pricey.  $5.50 for a Newcastle, but this is Vegas.\n\nParking is a little cramped but I got lucky and got a good spot just as another guy pulled out.  They had a dj playing songs off an apple laptop and he was playing a good mix of stuff.  Made me feel like I was back in college when he put on Crazytown.  When you're here, check out the upstairs area where you can kick back with some pool.  Another interesting note about the Crown and Anchor is the it's the hangout of choice for boxer Ricky Hatton when he fights in Vegas."

I learned earlier this year that john courage will not be available on tap anywhere in the U.S., so that was a bummer.

Martini was delivered with no olives and I caught the waitress and told her no olives.  She returned sometime later with two olives on a pick, and when she put them into the glass, she pulled them off the pick.  Later I told her that in the future when a martini is served, the olives stay in the drink on the pick.  Guess she didn't serve many martinis.  But I digress.  We started with the garlic mushrooms and a Stilton cheese & crackers plate.  The cheese was good, but the mushrooms were so good we were fighting over them.  I could have made a meal just of those mushrooms.  BF had fish & chips, which he said were good, but not the best ever.  I had lamb stew in Yorkshire pudding, which I thought was fabulous.   Very busy place, and service was a little slow, altho lots of people and not enough waitspeople in my opinion.   However, we will be bringing a big crowd of people back here in March to celebrate an early St. Patty's Day!!!!"

They don't mind you camping out getting work done on your laptop as long as you're paying your way. One of my favorite places to get real writing done uninterrupted.

However after I started attending UNLV a few years ago, I rediscovered the place after realizing it was so close to the campus.  \n\nI would highly recommend the Steak and Mushroom pie, and you definitely can't go wrong with the fish and chips either.  The staff are very friendly, I'm always seated quickly, and the wait for food usually isn't too long.  Most recently, Jess was my waitress and she was very friendly and attentive.  I'm a serviceman, but unfortunately they don't offer military discounts, something that I would appreciate seeing.  However, they do offer discounts for UNLV personnel which I take advantage of.  The ambience is casual and a little old fashioned (which I like), and it makes for a great stop at just about any time of day or night.  The music usually isn't too loud, so your not struggling to carry on a conversation with the person next to you.  I also enjoy looking at the Naval-oriented artwork and decoration on the walls and ceiling, it only adds to the authenticity of the pub.\n\nAll in all, its a great place to grab a meal, a drink, and a chat!"

Broken chairs, dirty carpets, dust and cobwebs hanging off everything.  Makes you wonder what state the kitchen is in.....\n\nFor a bar that shows so much sport I was amazed at the state of the TV's.  Some of them look 20 years old, the quality of the picture on the big screen was absolutely awful.  No HD Box?  Are we living in 1995? It's criminal that any bar showing sports doesn't have good TV's and a HD feed.  You can get 55\" LCD HDTV's these days for $800! I watched the game on a 21\" TV! Just goes to show the owners aren't investing/looking after the property.\n\nThe one thing that was a positive was the staff, they were great, especially the french waitress that looked after us (at least I think she was french).\n\nNext time I want to see a game in Vegas I'll head elsewhere, it's just not worth the trip off the Strip these days.

I once saw them do a takeout order of 25 orders of fish and chips for some higher roller at Wynn so that means something to me, too. \n\nSo that having been said, it's always lots of fun here especially now during the world cup and you can't beat the $20 video poker free lunch special. \n\nWord of warning, they do have a weird alcohol license where you can only have beer at the bar but beer or alcohol in the dining area. So get your seat at the bar and whenever you want a shot, order from the waitress in the dining area."

The beer selection is great for me, because I am a big fan of British beers.  This might be the only place in the city that has Bombardier Ale on tap.  The food is very good, and the prices are reasonable.\n\nThe problems: \n\nThe prices on beer seem to have gone up quite a bit over the last couple of year.  This used to be a good place to come for a couple of $5 drinks, but on the last couple of visits I payed close to $14 for two beers.  Their Happy Hour prices are a little cheaper, but not much.\n\nI really hate to mention this, but there is a roach problem here.  If you sit outside, you're going to see a ton of roaches.  That's not such a big deal, but I have also had the same problem when sitting at the bar.  If you are coming here to eat, I would HIGHLY recommend that you sit at a table in the restaurant part of the room.  I have only eaten food on the bar-top twice, and both times there were roaches crawling around on the condiment bottles and near my food.  The food is really good, though, so I will certainly eat here again, just not at the bar."

I've watched world cup games here before and the world cup watching atmosphere is great.  Service was excellent and the dining room waitress was attentive.  She was nice enough to switch the TV to another Champions League game for us.\n\nI really like the fish and chips.  The only better version I've had is when I ate lunch by the sea in Ireland at a restaurant that made the fish from the morning's catch.  The chicken fingers are at or near the best I've had for that dish in Las Vegas.  The beer selection is excellent and you can get a lot of english beers that are not readily available at other bars in Las Vegas.\n\nThis bar is a great place for on-strip tourists to get a flavor of off-strip and a great place for locals.  May want to pass on this bar if you don't like crowds and it is around world cup time (especially an England game or St. Patricks day)."

Honestly, I can't really remember what I have eaten there. My buddy Z loves the Scotch Egg. A hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage. He lives for it! \n\nThe real reason we go there. The football. No, not throwball, but the real football. The first experience watching a game there had to be the best. My team lost mind you. Horribly. The atmosphere in the place at 4am was better than any place in the U.S. anytime of day for (insert lame sport here). Chants were being sung. Taunting was taking place from table to table, just before friendly handshakes and rounds being bought for one another. The greatest part of that night/morning had to be at about 7am. We stumbled outside to see the sun up already. Down the parking lot a bit there were 4 British guys. One of which was completely obliterated, yet still felt he could do a jumping spin kick into his friends face. He proceeds to pull down his pants to his knickers. Leaving his black socks on mind you. He lines up his buddy, takes a leap, spins, kicks, misses by a mile and falls on his ass hard. We almost threw up from laughing so hard. Just the thought of this happening again makes us go back. \n\nWe will be visiting the Crown and Anchor in 3 weeks time for the Liverpool v. Manchester United match on 3/14.

And let's be honest here, whoever came up with their uniforms, you deserve a medal.\n\nBut it is the food we are interested in.\n\nThe wife went for the Sunday Dinner with roast beef, I had the Sunday dinner with lamb and beef, both dishes are served with Yorkshire pudding, veg and A roast potato (more on those in a minute), along with this my wife ordered a small house salad.\n\nAfter a while we had pretty much given up on the salad, no big deal, these things do happen. however, when are meals came out, they each had a house salad on the plate, along with the meat, potatoes, veg, Yorkshire pudding and gravy.....\n\nA pet peeve of mine is when waitstaff know that something isn't right, how a house salad, with gravy even makes it out of the kitchen is beyond me (unless this is the way the owners want it, in which case....WOW).\n\nAnyways, a quick recovery by the lady serving us, my salad which I did not order is gone and my wife has a nice house salad on the side, which would have been better served before the meal came out, but ok, on to the meal itself.\n\nIs it a \"traditional British Sunday dinner\", well yeah it is, in the same way that as a McDonald's 1/4 pounder is a gourmet burger, all the pieces are correct, it looks right, but there is just something missing.\n\nSo let us dissect the meal :\n\nThe meats were good, maybe a little thinly sliced, but that happens to be the way I like them, so I was happy, however, putting beef gravy on to lamb just destroys any taste to the meat, if you are going to offer both meats, it's actually better to serve the gravy on the side and let the customer mess it up.\n\nThe Yorkshire pudding was good, this is something that normally causes all kinds of issues to those not raised with the darn things, but they were good.\n\nVeg is veg, enough said and ignored.\n\nNow for the real crime on this dish, the roast potato.....This is going to be long, it is a story and a rant.\n\nThe Great British Roast Potato, a food that when done right makes a Brit smile and a non Brit wish they had been born a Brit, sounds like exaggeration huh ? \n\nA couple of years ago we were lucky enough to host the family Christmas dinner here, it seemed like half of California showed up, the women folk worked their wonders on the veg, the father in law worked on turkey and prime rib.\n\nOver in a corner of the kitchen the Brit who married into the family was hiding in a cloud of steam, gently giggling to himself, these poor Americans had no idea what was about to hit them. A bag of potatoes had been boiled, cut in half and were now being gently rocked back and forth in a colander.\n\nThe women were looking at the wife wondering, WTF did you go and marry this guy for ? And why won't he answer any questions about what he is cooking ?\n\n45 minutes before we are due to eat, the potatoes are placed in the oven, set at 325, basting in a bath of melted lard and drippings. After 15 minutes the oven door is quickly opened, the potatoes are quickly covered with the oil, 15 minutes later the door is again opened and the potatoes are turned over.\n\nSo 45 minutes pass, what comes out is a potato that is golden brown on the outside with a crispness to it while inside the potato is light and fluffy.... And totally ignored by everyone ! Heretics !\n\nThat is until the father in law becomes brave and decides to try one of these strange things his new son in law has produced.... Or it could of been his daughter kicking him under the table while not so subtly nodding at the bowl of potatoes, but he tries one, then ever so slowly reaches over and grabs the bowl and shovels a bunch of them on to his plate, the family is shocked, the strange new food is a hit with the old man, the Brit sits back with a little smile on his face.\n\nNow the reason for that long story is...... If you are going to serve roast potatoes serve roast potatoes, not two little bits of potato that if I had to guess came out of a bag frozen, were quickly thrown through some oil and then put on a plate and served.\n\nYes doing it right is time consuming, yes it can be a bit of a pain, but if a chain in the UK can do it day in and day out serving thousands of meals a day,there is no reason why a little restaurant cannot get such an important part of the meal right.\nFor this reason and this reason alone they get marked down, is that mean, well no it's not."

They have been there several times and could reocmmend things.\n\nFor an appetizer, I got a sausage roll, a spiced sausage wrapped and baked in a flaky pastry.  The sausage came sliced and was accompanied by a dish of mustard sauce that was excellent.  It really gave the sausage a nice flavor although it was good without the mustard.\n\nFor the mains, all three of us got steak and kidney pie.  This was a first for me and I enjoyed it a lot.  The steak cubes were very tender and the kidney had a very smooth texture and was quite flavorful.  The pie was topped by a flaky crust and it was piping hot.  (Sweeney Todd fans will get that).  With the pie comes mashed potatoes and gravy and a healthy serving of peas.  It turns out to be a large and filling meal.\n\nService was a little off.  One of my friends ordered water with her drink at the outset and was not brought it until near the end of the meal when she had to ask again.  Also, after being seated, the staff wasn't sure whose table it was until we asked.  \n\nI could easily be a fan of the Crown and Anchor but they have to be better with service."

It's always high on a lot my friend's lists of dive bars along with Frankie's Tiki Room, the Double Down, etc, but those recommendations are typically more for drinks and overall ambiance than food. This is why I was particularly skeptical about this one, even with a few friends swearing by it. Needless to say, I ate it and was more than surprised.\n\nThe pub is located on the east side of Tropicana in an iffy area of town, but you're not coming here for the class. The interior is decked out with British-inspired street signs, posters of boats and the like, with the waitresses wearing skimpy kilt outfits. There's also an outdoor patio which I've heard is dog friendly. I was fully expecting an overly loud, smoky bar scene that would have made eating a bit unsavory, but it was surprisingly quiet on the Saturday night we were there. The menu features all sorts of traditional British dishes that I've heard are hard to find at other locations around town. This is all good, but I only really care about burgers for the sake of this review so I'll have to try some of that other wacky stuff on my next visit.\n\nThe British Burger on their menu comes with a  1/2 pound patty, bacon, lettuce and tomato and choice of a few cheeses. My burger had great char flavor upon first bite, which carried all the way through. It was cooked a bit more than medium-rare but I was ok with it due to the overall great flavor. It was greasy for the first half, dried up a bit in the second half but was still ok because of the flavor. My bacon wasn't quite as cooked as I would have liked, but it still had decent flavor. The thin onions were good but I still pulled them off as to not overpower the great flavor I was experiencing. The lettuce and tomato were fresh, although the tomato was a little sparse, and the swiss cheese was melted and good as well. The bun was soft, gooey and delicious, and was very well proportioned to meat. Overall this was an excellent burger that I wasn't expecting at all.\n\nWhile I typically don't care for them, my steak fries were actually really good; they were cooked well for the most part but there were a few soggy ones in there.  My side pickle slices were good too; they never made it onto my burger but I still ate them. At $9.25 with fries this is very reasonably priced; combine that with a beer or three and you're in for a good time. If you're looking for a unique local pub with plenty of drink and food options definitely stop by the Crown & Anchor."

Unless you're sitting at the bar gambling, be prepared to wait: wait to order, wait for your drink, wait for your food, and wait for the bill. This last time wasn't so bad, however the time before that we had to wait for our server to finish taking pictures of herself with some other dude that worked there to get our bill. The food and drink is GREAT (scotch egg is top notch and the tender peas served as a side with many dishes a great comfort food to me), but the consistently poor service has finally eclipsed it. Bummer."

Called to find out if they had the la galaxy game (which was on fox sport west) and was told \"we have all the soccer games, we've never missed one\". Although the guy had no idea who the galaxy were and was not knowledgeable about soccer.  We drove a few miles there.  The waitress had no clue to anything soccer related and simply pointed to a schedule chalkboard.  As expected only premeir league games.  What made this especially upsetting was that they were playing a college (american) \"football\" game on one tv.  This place does not play any major league soccer games and instead shows college football!!!! Also, so much for the \"we never miss a game\" I was told in reference to major league soccer.  But the guy obviously had no idea what he was talking about and I was skeptical going there in the first place."

It was a Saturday night and a friend and I decided to stop for a drink.  We sat at the empty bar and ordered a drink.  The bartender not too friendly which by how busy it was you would think he'd be excited to have some visitors.\n\nAnyways, I was suprised to not see alot of people here.  I love the ambiance.  The best part was we moved our little party outside.  The weather was perfect and it sits right along the side of street where you can watch the cars go by.  Little white lights line the patio-super cool.  I love outdoor seating (sigh)-especially when the weather is good.  I do want to come back and try the food.  I also think it is a good spot to have a party...the ambiance is perfect for bringin in a good group of peeps and they have alot of seating.  See ya soon!"

Of course there is gaming, if you choose, but it's subtle, so the dark, British pub feel comes through without being blinded by lights coming from the screens. They have plenty of beers on tap or in bottles, and offer a full menu worth of food.  The food is British pub style, so don't expect an abundance of spice or anything healthy on the menu, but it is what it is.  I go here for the atmosphere, it's what a great hangout pub should be.  It can get a bit loud when they have their DJ's making it difficult to chat with anyone more than one seat down, but during it's quieter hours (before 10 pm) I think it's the perfect place to have a drink and settle in, maybe play a round of darts or pool with the posse.  Of course, they always have football (soccer) on the tele, so if you're looking for a place to watch the game, you've found it."

As far as a bar goes, it is pretty large and has a quality selection of import brews.  There is a jukebox that has some great music available as well.  Come here if you just want to chill near the strip.  The beers are not cheap by any means ($6-$8), but you can still have a good time nonetheless.  \n\nThe biggest thing about this bar is that they do not show prices on their beer menu.

My mother had a British boyfriend when I was young and she made him Yorkshire pudding. This one was better than some I've had, but not as good as \"Mom used to make\". But since those weren't authentically \"Authentic\" it's tough to deduct points for it.  They got cold quick, but that was probably because of the \"Giantness\" \n\nProbably the best Scotch Eggs I've ever had are here. And you can get them cold OR warm (I personally recommend warm).\n\nI also had the Fish and Chips (Since I was going for \"The Classic\" British Style) and they were good.  Just one fish, but it was a pretty big fillet, so no complaints.\n\nWe finished it off with Sticky Toffee Pudding which was great!\n\nThrough all of this, the ONE waitress kept on top of a pretty busy place.  Considering she was the only one waiting tables her performance was extraordinary. Though as an understandable side effect, service was a bit slow and a member of the party never got the coffee she ordered with the Pudding.\n\nI wish I was in Vegas more often so I could stop in more often. I do hope to come back the next time I'm in town.\n\nOne other side note.. They do have a \"Pet Friendly Patio\" so you can bring your pet for a meal outside.\n\n(PS: Due to some drunkenness, I checked in twice.  I've only been here once. The second check in is wishful thinking. Unless it is very far in the future and I've been here more than twice.  In which case, subtract one)"

Annoyed when I told him I wanted extra pickles... Annoyed when I told him I wanted cheese. Just annoyed. Clearly Brian wasn't aware that we were...

Considering it was a Thursday night, we anticipated a heavy college crowd, but were surprised to find it half-full. After a round of drinks, dinner was ordered. My selection was the chicken curry. I ordered as-is and found the dish to be quite kicking. The medium-sized chicken cuts were doused with a thin yellow sauce. The sauce is what made the dish kick. Unable to figure out whether what made it kick outside of any curry taste, I was baffled and prayed that my stomach wouldn't hurt later. It didn't. The dish, while seemingly small for the famished, ended up being very filling. Complemented by chicken tenders, I was very full and quite happy. \n\nConsider this place if you're bored and want to get out of Vegas, and have a dinner with the locals.

Thehighest scoring team receives a 50 dollar bar tab to be used at their next visit. It's competitive, free, and a blast.

It WILL take you two hours to get three rounds of drinks on a good night.  Err, while I'm at it, I may as well mention parking as well.  I have only lucked out twice with parking at this place, and that was only because I pulled up as someone was pulling out.  On several occasions, my friends and I have parked at Metro across the street or Sherman-Williams and walked over.  Their parking lot is kind of hazardous, anyway.  It's very tight and really difficult to maneuver around in if you get stuck in a sticky place.\n\nBut now that I got THAT out of the way (I'm sorry C&A, for I do love you so!), let's get to the goodies.  My friends and I love this place for every reason you could love a pub.  Crown is super cozy and completely raucous at the same time!  When you walk in, you will see people from all walks: older groups enjoy it, the UNLV crowd is pretty big, business people head there after work, and clubbers hit it up for the predancetimebuzz.\n\nSome one mentioned the old wood, and wax, and it takes me back to my Nana Wendy's house.  I sit down and look at the menu and see my family's traditional \"home-cooked\" foods--shepherd's pie, bangers and hash, scotch eggs, cod and chips, curries--for even though I'm from the South, my father and his family are British!\n\nThe imported beers list gives a nice sample of the many great UK (and I mean all the countries involved, not just GB) beers, with plenty on tap.  If you're feeling adventurous, the bartender and *some* of the wait staff are very knowledgeable and will happily recommend something to quench what you're thirstin' fer.  \n\nIf sitting around outside with a smoke, a beer, and a group of friends at a great pub isn't enough excitement for you, inside they have darts, video poker, and several televisions for your pubbing pleasure.  They also frequently host events aimed at the UNLV crowd, like the British Comedy bash, music, and more.  Hello AbFab costume!!"

The whole point of pubs is that you shouldn't have to drive!\n\nThe final, fantastic thing about this place is that it's the only pub I know of in Las Vegas where dogs are allowed (on the outdoor patio, of course)!  I have yet to come across any misbehaving dogs - and fingers crossed it stays that way so they don't get banned!"

            "review": "It has been quite awhile since we have eaten here. Even though the food was always good we never liked the fact that they didn't have a true non smoking section. The restaurant is non smoking but is adjacent to a bar where smoking is allowed and there is no separation between the two. If I can smell it and need to shower when I get home than it is not non smoking in my book. That is not my complaint however, I knew what I was getting into there. My complaint is about the service.\n\nWe waited a longer than acceptable time to order. We were all pretty hungry and some of us ordered the pies which we are aware take longer than the average entr\u00e9e so we ordered a cup of soup in addition. Our server was either absent or darting by so fast we couldn't get her attention between when we ordered and our food came out. Several of our drinks were dry and those of us who ordered soup were wondering if it had been forgotten. In addition a couple of us wanted to order something from the bar but gave up on that idea. The soup did came out with the entrees and when I commented that I had expected it quite awhile ago the server just said that the kitchen put everything out at one time.\n\nNow I am not na\u00efve or self centered enough to think that they made a special pot of soup for me so I am not sure what was so difficult about ladling it into a cup, or more importantly why she didn't check on it when it didn't come up very shortly after the order had been placed. I was not expecting a grand gesture but a simple apology would have sufficed. To add to that our glasses sat empty until my husband stood up and called her back and requested refills.\n\nThe food itself was pretty good. The stilton and cabbage soup is excellent and the steak and mushroom pie is very tasty if not a little sparse on filling, especially for the price. The mashed potatoes were the one bleak spot of the dinner, not even warm and hardened as if they had sat out for too long. So overall, pricey for what it is and service seems to be pretty spotty. Not enough to entice me back to contend with the smoking aspect."

Nothing was seasoned and didn't have any taste unless it was drowning in their brown gravy or came with a dipping sauce. Out the can peas were on both of my plates. Barely warm, no salt, no pepper, no butter, no olive oil.\n\nAfter paying 18+ bucks for food and drinks, and being stuck eating mostly french fries and overly battered onion rings, I left knowing I wont be coming back here."

We got there just after noon on Sunday and had the place to ourselves (I know, we are bad people to go to a bar on Easter, but it is Vegas, so...).\n\nThe food was pretty good, although the lamb was very fatty and the beef was a bit overcooked. The veggies (peas and carrots) were cooked very well. Hot but slightly crunchy - no overbuild mush here. The mashed potatoes were real and the gravy was brown and rich. I question whether we got yorkshire pudding or a popover as it didn't have any beef flavoring, which was expected based on how it should be cooked. Regardless, it was pretty tasty.\n\nI know several reviewers complained about the service, but we had no problem at all. Sure, we were in an empty bar, but I can't discount the service we got because of that. If I had any complaint about the place is that it had a bit of a grimy (not well cleaned) feel to it.

We usually visit with friends, family and anybody else we can find to bring along! It's a great atmosphere and worth paying a little extra for the imported draughts! As I'm a British and a US citizen, living in Las Vegas, we thought it would be a nice start to the day as the race started at 8:15am here.\n\nI tried calling the pub three times before arriving to check if you were showing the race on TV, but the telephone went to the answering machine each time. We arrived around 25 minutes before the race and asked a Mexican bartender working there if you would be showing the Grand National. She immediately replied \"Yes, of course!\". Without hesitation, we bought a pint and sat down looking the menu over for some breakfast!\n\nSeveral minutes passed and all the main televisions were still only displaying the Man U and Newcastle football game. We'd all but missed the pre-race commentary and race line-up, I finally had to asked what time she would be turning the TV over. She said \"I'll change it in just a minute\" and walked away. Five minutes before the race started (and after asking the cleaner/repair chap also because the bartender had disappeared on us), the bartender came over to our table and said \"You wanted the Chelsea game?\". I don't believe for one instant that she comprehended what I had asked before purchasing drinks. I told her that \"we came to see The Grand National\". She seemed confused and asked somebody else working there. Another lady in her early 30s came over and asked what we wanted. When I told her, she said something to the effect of \"I don't understand, what's The Grand National?\" having no idea what we were referring to.\n\nWe were very disappointed. Not only did we miss the race (we arrived in plenty of time so that we'd have other options if it was not shown there), but we were lied to. We sat there feeling like idiots with drinks to accompany, quite frankly, nothing! It was also sad to hear that, in a British Pub, none of the workers currently working had any idea what a near two-century-old race even was!! So if you wondered why somebody left full drinks on the table, that was us. As regular customers, I think we will take our patronage elsewhere. I will just have to wait until my bi-annual trip back to the UK to experiences and delights that I am still missing."

It wasn't until my junior year that I went with a few friends to have a drink at this quaint littler tavern, and oh my God was I surprised.\n\nOn the outside it seems like a sleepy little pub on the outskirts of London, but on the inside is anything but.  The Establishment is divided into two main sections: a dining room and the bar area.  My friends and I decided to get a bit to eat first and participate in drunken debauchery afterword (Just Kidding (*Wink)).  \n\nThe dining room had the best of both worlds; the look and feel of an authentic British pub, with four huge Widescreen TVs on each corner of the room, blaring out endless sports center highlights from the day.  The waitresses were dressed in skimpy little outfits and actually knew some of the girls on a personal level from school.  The service was great, but not excellent.  They were very nice to me and my buddies, probably because we were friends, but the service could improve if the hosts and waitresses would treat the other patron with the same level of costumer service.\n\nThe best part about his restaurant was the food.  I had Fish and Chips and I have to say that they were the best damn Fish and Chips I have ever had period.  I have been      here many time since then and I swear the food gets better every time.  They also have a huge selection of assorted British beers which I have to admit is pretty damn awesome.

I pretty much guessed beforehand going into this that the place would be a little divey since after all it's a pub, however I wasn't prepared for how my meal here went. Walking up to the entrance you see their patio area for pets which I think is a cute idea but then seeing the grass having huge divots and holes with standing water in them going stagnant made me feel like I would never want my dog to visit here. Then came walking inside. We waited to be seated since there is a sign kindly requesting you wait to be helped, well waiting we did, then waiting some more & some more which felt strange since there was only maybe 10 other guests there tops. The hostess was kind, I was surprised to see how hiked up her skirt was but again I thought \"well this is a pub in Las Vegas\" so I wasn't upset. She was kind enough to take our drink orders and return with them a short time later, when she came back she took our meal orders: bangers & mash and fish & chips. We then waited a long time to see the hostess/waitress again it was about 40 minutes for our food, which wouldn't have been a big deal if the food we got back was hot and appetizing. The bangers & beans were Luke warm and the mash was cold with cold gravy where it's more like meat flavored jello than gravy. The fish & chips were okay in the sense that yes it's fried and a huge piece of fish but I wasn't expecting it to be soaked in oil when I received it and the side of peas appeared fine until I watched a small fly crawl out of them and fly away. Trying to make the best of it with my guest we decided to have the food be taken away and we dared enough to try dessert which was probably the only thing we did enjoy. The things I failed to mention through out this review is that while sitting there the entire time we really took in how filthy the place is with holes in the wall, dirty light switches and scuffs everywhere and creaky filthy floors & A LOT of spider webs everywhere A LOT. The tables are spaced out about 2 ft apart which wasn't a big deal, but my prior mention of the hostesses uniform made it uncomfortable when she bent over to fix up the table next to us which was also odd considering the place setting I was seated at was already dirty from someone else eating on it. I think the worst part of all was leaving their one way parking lot and seeing the back door being held wide open with a rope, immediately all of my food handling knowledge & certifications kicked into high gear knowing that open doors are a EXTREME no no because it allows pests of all kinds directly in. All & all its not a place I would go back to and it made me feel awful that I actually invited someone to join me without checking it beforehand, I won't be returning & nothing could make me desire too. So much more happened but I'm done talking about it. I dined in on 10/10/15 around 2:45pm"

The tomato was fresh, but I was a bit expecting the beets to be pickled but they were just cold cooked beat slices.\n\nService was fine, though nothing spectacular.  The young lass who served us did a good job, but she didn't provide excellent service, it was just kind of a step above adequate.\n\nAgain, I really wanted to like the place.  The atmosphere is cool in a corny kind of a way.  I am fond of kitsch, but if you are going for kitsch you also have to provide more than a semi cozy English pub type environment.  You also need to have food that is going to live up to the hype, sadly the Crown & Anchor had the sizzle, but no steak."

If I had to complain about anything(it's a small one)...it would be the need for a few more upper end craft beers.

Your best bet is to get a seat at the bar.  At the time of my visit, the waitresses were a bit overwhelmed.  We told the waitress that we'd wait for a table at the bar.  I guess she forgot about us because she sat a party that came though the door before sitting us who were waiting; so, we just opted for sitting at the bar.  \n\nThe bar tender on the other hand, was super nice.  He ended taking our order and noticing that our food had not come out, compensated our wait with a beer.\n\nOf note is the locals and their understated like for the video poker.

The place was packed with about 12 Arsenal supporters and about 10-12 West Ham supporters. The bartender was a complete tool and acted like he owned the place. He was obviously messed up on something. It took him forever to get our drinks. When the game started he still had to jukebox playing over the audio system. Several people started asking him to put the game audio on. He kept making that fingers rubbing together money signal like we needed to pay him. Finally I cornered him coming out of the kitchen and asked him to put the audio on. In a quick response he said \"If you pay me.\" I threw $2 at him and said here take it. It then took him 10 minutes to get it working. He's a complete tool and thinks he runs this place. Horrible experience and I doubt I will ever be back. I have watched dozens of matches in the place and it has gone to shit. The problem is all the cabbies drop tourists off at this place and there really isn't another football bar in Vegas that I know of. Super annoying and I am pissed off about the bartender. I have been several other times when he's working and its a complete buzz kill. Its a complete shame because this place could be cool."

Some very interesting English items on the menu and some I've never had before.\nLet's start with the pasty that one of the diners had. I can't comment truthfully on this because the pasties that I've had all my life living in Michigan are made differently but these were still good. So I'm just partial to the different way of making them.  Have to admit they were large and well-made with a generous amount of mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  Forgot to mention we started with a cup of their incredibly delicious creamed cabbage and Stilton soup. Wow! \n\nThe rest of us had their much touted fish and chips and that I can tell you I've had many,many times in many,  many places but these were exceptionally good.\nOne very large,  thick piece of perfectly done, fresh Icelandic cod lightly breaded-and one was enough. One diner and I substituted the fries for onion rings which we both loved.  The fish and chips come with a generous portion of peas... Very English indeed.\nService was outstanding from the minute we walked in until the minute we left. Our waitress Jessica was not only very friendly and outgoing but treated us like guests in her home.  We definitely will go back and we hope we get Jessica again.\nI would recommend the Crown and Anchor."

Someone cheaped out on a real liquor license and just doesn't care at this point.\n\nSecond, the fish + chips I've tried twice here and its completely lackluster. Not worth the hype. It tastes frozen. The chips were mealy, both times. Very middle of the road. Maybe they had a better chef or food distributor a while back when it got voted #1 in Vegas, but there's far better elsewhere.\n\nThe jukebox was a little bit crap too. I heard the Police greatest hits for a little too long. Then it was followed by 1990's euro trash techno. Very blah.\n\nOn the upside: great atmosphere, great room, nice pool tables.

Great service, great food, great drinks, awesome prices.  It's a pub, so go into it with that in mind.  Happy hour draught  drinks!  I grew up on English food, and this meal reminded me of that.  Yorkshire pudding, with butter, gravy &/or honey-butter, to die for!  While we didn't have room, we still ordered the apple-crumble for dessert, and I'm glad we did.  Warm custard/pudding, with apple, and crumble, a real treat to end the meal.  Wish I had discovered this place earlier in our trip, as I would have frequented them more often."

I wanted to find some good local places, off the strip, where the food was neither buffet nor over-priced.  Their meat pies were top notch, the cider was fresh, the beer was priced well and they carried a lot of imported foods that are hard to find most places.  Being an off strip place - it seems to cater to locals and I really liked that.  The first waitress was fabulous - fast, attentive and smiley.  The second was very friendly but much slower and less on top of things.  However she was adequate.  The only draw back to this place was how smokey it smelled - but its vegas and the law says you can smoke in the pubs so...\nThis is a place I will definitely frequent again when I am in town.  In terms of being traditional, I am a first generation Canadian, raised by a family of Brits and I can say this is good authentic style pub.  WELL DONE!"

They have a variety of beers on tap and after you've had them all (all 30), they'll give you some kind of Crown and Anchor swag. \n\nThought it was kinda weird that the place was filled with seats. In other cities, a type of bar like this would also double as a club haha. That wouldn't fly in Vegas I suppose.\n\nIf you're a local and looking for a chill time with a very young and college scene, come here. No grimy old man pedos. \n\nIf you're a tourist and you've ventured this far from the strip, you'll find this place a comforting and unpretentious bar to pass the time.\n\nMinus one star for the service which is also very collegy."

However, after eating and waiting for the bill to arrive my friends noticed a HUGE cockroach on my shirt that had come out from the dark recesses of under the table to say hello.

Once we got there we realized something horrifying:  the air conditioner was BARELY on!  Then to make matters even worse NOBODY took our order for a good TEN MINUTES while we sat there (yes, I DID keep track, thank you!)...\n\nSo why the HELL would I give such a lame place four stars?  Probably 4.5 to be exact?  Because C&A is just what I miss about London and definitely lived up to high expectations!\n\nDecor is wild.  Definitely reminded me of the drunken stumbles around Notting Hill during World Cup '06.  It felt VERY pub-esque and I loved it so much.  Beer selection is...  eh?  Well let's just say that if you love them English-style beers then you're in heaven.  It was hard to break from the black and tans (especially for hopheads like my brother and myself) so we didn't -- which was fine.  LOTS of weekly specials...  Kind of makes me wish I was either a UNLV student or a casino industry worker.  Or that at least I lived around here to make it out for their occasional food and drink specials.  Or at least to be able to enjoy soccer (sorry, but there is already another sport in this country called 'football' ... TM Justin Timberlake @ the ESPYs) on the numerous TVs.  But the food, jeez, the FOOD!!!\n\nFish and chips.  Cod was fried EXACTLY the way we love it -- and my bro and I BOTH agreed that it's way better than the Olde Ship's (British pub-ish place here in Orange County) fish.  Thin, crispy outside, flaky yumminess of fish on the inside.  Tartar sauce was perfect.  Fries were perfect.  We chose to throw most of the peas into my chicken curry.  Speaking of which...  chicken curry!  Kind of what I expected -- not spicy, good flavor -- but soooo much food!  I chose to order it on the rice since my brother already had chips.  Good call.  Perfect consistency in the potatoes, LOVED the mushrooms, chunks of chicken were a good size.  It was just SO FILLING!\n\nThe night's ultimate experience, however, came in the form of an impromptu \"Today's Special\" dessert:  the sticky toffee pudding was proudly displayed on the night's chalkboard.  Sooo...  what were we to do?  And DEAR GAWD did we make an excellent decision.  The toffee sauce is TO DIE FOR.  I absolutely despise raisins but I stuffed them in my mouth as far as this culinary sinfulness was concerned.  Bread pudding-ish + buttery toffee moat + whipped cream + raisins = one of the most delightful sweets I'd EVER had in my life!\n\nWe were so stuffed we couldn't even order another beer.  We were so food comatose that we had to get back to the Tropicana and take a nap before going out for the *night*...  And even though the service was HELLA slow (to use the parlance of our times), and the beer selection is essentially the LAST straw for a hophead, and it took the bar forever to call our return taxi...  I give C&A a proud 4.5 stars, especially since I fell in love with London a couple years ago and this joint is the closest thing to London for me :)"

Oh well , it is Vegas after all. I was greeted and seated immediately and the service remained very good throughout my meal.\nThe menu looked very tempting and included all of the standard British pub fair. I was very tempted to try the Steak and Mushroom pie, but I was there for the Fish and Chips.\nThe meal came out very quickly and looked delicious. The fish was maybe haddock and was well cooked, moist and flakey. However the batter had a bitter taste; maybe old oil or maybe aluminized baking powder in the batter, which I'm sensitive to. It was  not overwhelming, but enough that I would not order it again. The chips were great (which maybe points to the batter rater than the oil) and the included peas, well they were peas.\nI gave  them a 3, but if I rated then strictly on this  meal it would have been lower. I do have a feeling a different night or a different entre may have been much better. I may give them another shot next time I am in Vegas, maybe the Steak and Mushroom pie  next time"

Trying to get one of the waitresses' attention was another thing as well. \nThey were darting so fast to the group outside that they completely disregarded us. \nEventually, someone in our group just decided to try to get her attention because she was so flustered at the fact that we had been waiting so long and the only table that appeared to have ordered anything was a group outside.\n\nI ended up ordering the Mozzarella sticks while everyone else got chicken fingers and/or curry.\n\nOur meal took a good while. At least, it felt like it. We burned through so many conversations that I began to wonder if our server had gotten our order out.\n\nShe finally came around and brought us our food. Keep in mind that during this whole time, everyone at the table had already gotten through their drinks and she had walked past us quite a handful of times and not once even asked us if we wanted any other drinks.\n\nMozzarella sticks were the BOMB.com. \nThe guys liked the chicken fingers, however, the curry order was wrong. It was ordered without chicken but had so much of it that our friend wasn't happy with it at all.\n\nWe finished our food (except the curry plate) and still had to wait for our server to even check up on us.\nThe service on a scale of 1-10 was at a 3 for me.\nI completely understand that she was checking up constantly on the group outside, being that they were a larger group, but if I had known she wouldn't have shown us the same courtesy, I would've opted to go to another pub or bar instead.\nTreat your customers right. All we wanted was to just be checked up on and offered drinks. It wouldn't have been anything complicated. What's annoying to me is that she preferred to give another group good service, but couldn't even provide us with basic service. How are you so sure we wouldn't have left a great tip for you just for checking up on us as you were darting by? Instead, we were ignored. \nThe fact that it wasn't even busy, let alone she wasn't the only server there is just the icing on top of it all.\n\nI'm not sure the food is worth coming back for.\nIn all honesty, I'm the type of person who if I go to a cool bar/pub/restaurant/etc. I always share it with people and bring them back with me.\nMy first experience was mediocre. Pretty disappointing.\nIn the meantime, I think I'll have to stick to Gold Spike or Park."

To get on with the story though we walked right in and were able to sit down immediately which was nice. The waitress was at our table within 2 min or so and we ordered beverages and our food right away. My friends water was there within 3-5min or so, my coke however took almost 20 min to show up. After that it took another 20 min for our fish (keep in mind this was AYCE so the fish should be ready quick. After getting our fish, i kid you not it was 40 min before our waitress even stopped back needless to say we had been waiting and trying to ask her for fish for 20min at least. We talk to her and fish is there then somehow within only 5 min. It was then another 20 before we see her again and ask for our check. For anyone that took the time to read this, i really hope that we were an exception and nobody else goes through this. The service as a whole sucked. The people on either side sucked (relationship fighting, and a guy talking in a terrible British accent). In whole dinner took around 2 hours.

When we come for breakfast which is served all day, they always bring Zeus some extra bacon and a sausage.  He loves this place."

If you want to watch football with real football fans, to hoot and holler, then Crown and Anchor is your place. \n\nThey have a ton of European beers on tap, and they serve traditional British and Irish fare on the menu. I like the Chip Butty because, really, where else are you going to get a french fry and butter sandwich? But that's essentially what you have here: a french fry and butter sandwich. \n\nFans of all clubs can go here and have a good time; it isn't an Arsenal bar or a Man United Bar. It's a football bar.

I thought the avocado was fine, but the bread was a bit dry. I would have preferred less fries and instead maybe a cold slaw side or some salad side accompanying it. 3.0 for the food.\n\nBeer: Both my friend and I had the summer ale. I have to say that it was pretty good. I forgot to ask them if they brewed it themselves, but this pub has an extensive list of beer including imports. The summer ale is a special and it included a dose of citrus. Pretty good light beer. I normally don't drink and even I thought this was refreshing.\n\nService: Our waitress was very friendly. She also invited my friend and I to the quiz night going on that evening even though we did not go to it. The outfits at this pub are pretty cute- note very short plaided skirts. The food was brought out relatively fast along with the beer.\n\nParking: Ample parking in a private lot (free).\n\nPayment: Takes credit card.\n\nLocation: It's off strip and pretty close to the freeway. One can probably take a cab here or drive here if you have a car.\n\nOverall, the pub was pretty friendly and our waitress was awesome. The food was okay, but the beer made up for it. I also filled out a survey with comments and it will be entered for a $25 gift card to the pub."

From the quizzical looks I get when I wear my Cesc Fabregas Arsenal jersey in public, to the \"huh?\" I get from bartenders at other bars when I ask if they can put a soccer match on, being a soccer fan is sometimes like being the red-headed stepchild.\n\nWhich is why I love this place so much.  Simply put, this is the best British Pub I have ever been to.  It isn't a big bar by most standards, but it's very homely and it just feels warm to be inside.  They have pool, darts and foosball for those interested in bar games.  They do have video poker like in most bars these days, but this is a bar better for socializing or watching a match than playing poker.  \n\nI just got back today from watching Arsenal play Barcelona in a UEFA Champions League match, and while the place was pretty empty when I got there 20 minutes before match time, practically all the seats were taken by kickoff.  The British Burger I ordered was absolutely delicious, and next time I must try the fish and chips.  Even though it was noonish, the people watching the match were rowdy and fun, and despite the intensity of a hugely important match were for the most part friendly.  While the fans are passionate and intense, you probably don't have to worry about brawls breaking out.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about this place is that the parking lot of quite small and cramped.  If you're going here to watch a match, be sure to get there early, as it fills pretty fast, particularly if it's a popular club or country playing (I.E. Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal or England's National Team).  Besides, the smaller lot probably encourages designated driving, so you can experience those many beers and get home safely :)\n\nPROS:\n-Authentic British pub decor\n-Wide selection of beers \n-Plenty of bar games\n-Great Food!\n-Soccer, er, Football fans!\n\nCONS:\nSmall, cramped parking lot."

Poor service!!!\n\nThere also seemed to be some odd \"rules\" here about where they could and couldn't serve alcoholic beverages. They said it had something to do with their liquor license but it sounded like some BS to us. \n\nHaving been the DD, I decided to order a soda. Yuck!!!! The syrup was not only gone but it tasted old and spoiled almost. That was disgusting. I sent that back and just had water. \n\nWe threw a few games of cricket and called it quits. The score boards weren't at all in good shape. The boards were super beat up too. The bull line was real worn out. I knew this spot was dicey but this was pretty bad. I doubt I'll be back."

We had just had a great dinner and great drinks elsewhere, decided we wanted to go have a few drinks and some fun. Found this place, went up to the bar ordered a round of Jamisons which we were told we could only have if we had a table and ordered food. Ended up having a round of beer and leaving with a very very unhappy date."

            "review": "I can say this is probably one of my new favorite places. I came across this place by sheer luck when I was craving some sort of shepherds pie and didn't feel like driving up to the Irish pubs I frequent in town. \"English people eat that shit too!\" I told myself as I made an illegal u-turn in the middle of Tropicana. (ok no I didn't but it adds to the story right?)\n\nThe place has a really cool set up, there's a restaurant and bar area, and also a dart board (for the not too rowdy) The bartender Adam (I think?) was really nice and was ready to explain anything on the menu we had questions about. The good service continued the second time I had returned here, the waitresses are friendly and quick with orders. \n\nI'm the type of person that likes to eat a crapton of food while I drink, cause I'm a fat bastard, and the delicious food here is more than enough for me to get my fill. The cottage pie is probably my favorite thing on their menu, along with plenty of Yorkshire pudding and gravy sauce. I'm getting hungry just typing this. I told you I was a fat bastard."

The all you can eat English fish & chips (Monday night), chicken curry, chicken & leek pie and Lancashire hot pot are some of my favorite menu items.  Big beer selection and full bar lacking the typical douchebag Vegas tourist is a huge plus.  Most of the out-of-towners are here visiting with a local. \n\nFriendly, prompt waitresses and bartenders do their job well.  Parking can be a bitch at times but that's the only negative that comes to mind.  Oh...that and the mens bathroom sink's water pressure is up pretty high so when you turn it on, you get splashed in the front of your pants making it look like you wee'd on yourself.\n\nCrown & Anchor has done a damn fine job making you feel as if you are in an authentic \"British Pub\"  so much so that you forget you are still in Vegas (which is a good thing.)  \n\nCheers!"

Never had a bad experience here and love the place. Recommend the fish and chips, the chicken curry and the Ploughman's lunch. Must Do Vegas Haunt!"

You can have an awesome dinner for two and seriously spend under 25 dollars. The staff is friendly , the waitresses wear short skirts but act like ladies. Its not a 4 star english dining experience if thats what you are looking for its a laid back fun pub with a dart board and a bad ass beer selection!  and delish food. Bangers and mash are good, and the chips are always light and crunchy ."

We went specifically for the fishn chips because the fish weve been getting at Ellis island is so greasy!  Our fish was delicious! We just got one piece but it was a big ass fat piece crispy, lightly battered and most delicious. Steak fries were yummy and they have what tasted like the make it yourself ranch dressing, yum! Peas had no seasoning but not a big deal salt and pepper were right there on the table! Our server Tracy was fantastic and treated us well, we will most definately be back. They also have Pepsi products as most places do when you get off the strip. Well done Crown, well done. Now if they would just take down those redskin banners...Lol"
