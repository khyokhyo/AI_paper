            "review": "Salmon Craving Satisfied in Vegas - Who'da Thought!\n\nSITREP\n\nI found myself hitting the Happy Hour here at Red Square (located at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino) and it did not disappoint.  \n\nTHE SETUP\n\nMy sweet dance partner and I were jone'sin for some munchies before we hit a dance competition event, but there was not going to be any food there.\n\nInterestingly enough, we had just talked about our uncles - how they both hail from Idaho - and hers is sportsman who catches Salmon from the Snake River.  So as we arrived into Red Square, two (2) menu items just JUMPED OUT at us, like 2 Chinooks, and so we \"jumped on them\", so to speak.\n\nLE MENU\n\nThe items had Salmon on them!  So for us, this was meant to be:\n\n(1)  I saw the Siberian Nachos, which consisted of Salmon, Crispy Potato Gautrette, Sour Cream, and Caviar, believe it not.  Absolutely delicious, and probably the most singularly different nachos I've ever had; and then,\n\n(2)  We were BOTH intrigued by the Smoked Salmon Pizza, which consisted of generous strips of smoked salmon & pickled red onions.  [The flavor of the pickled red onions  was a bit much for Cassandra, but we resolved that issue by picking them off.]\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nDefinitely plan on coming back to Red Square again when I hit Vegas again."

We were checked on continuously and even though I wasn't hungry, I was salivating at the food that was brought out.\n\nLobster with pasta noodles. Mm... Delicious! I do not regret coming here at all.\n\nBut sadly there is a drawback. Super expensive. Not a place for the faint walleted. Since everything in Vegas is so expensive, you may want to decide where you want to spend all your money!"

They honored the check in for a free drink and the beef stroganoff was delicious!! I love how the cooked and served the beef like a steak instead of cutting it into little pieces. \n\n The place was so good that I dragged the rest of my co workers there to eat there two days later. This time I ordered the shrimp. Beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. Definitely will be my go to place the next time I'm at the Mandalay for a trade show."

            "review": "Mandana K, Dave H and myself wandered around Mandalay looking for any bar to be open at 3:30 in the afternoon.  We stumbled upon a statute of a beheaded Lenin, signaling the entrance to the Red Square, which didn't open until 4 PM.  Once 4 arrived, we were the first to walk into the bar that day, taking seats at the bar, which is made out of ice.  \n\nSince this is a Russian-themed bar, they stock a wide assortment of vodkas.  On their menu, they had pages and pages of specialty vodka drinks.  We decided to each order different drinks so that we could sample each others.  \n\nSince there were only a few other patrons, we learned about the history of the place.  When the bar first opened, the bar generated a lot of controversy with the Russian community because of the statute of Lenin -- head attached -- and the perceived romantacizing of Communism.  The bar caved -- or maybe it was really a great publicity ploy -- and decided to behead Lenin in a public ceremony.  The head now resides inside a block of ice in the vodka locker, a walk-in, sub-zero freezer that stores premium vodka for their clients; it's so cold that before you enter, you need to don a thick, russian like fur coat and hat.  \n\nWe toured the locker, knocked back a shot of vodka, and read the names of those who rented shelf space inside the locker.  For several thousand dollars a year, one can rent a space, store any vodka you please, have a name plate, and enter the locker any time you please.  Not a bad deal if split among the three of us\n\nWe continued to order drinks off the menu until we knocked back every single drink on the menu.  We looked around.  Just as we entered the bar as their first patrons, we exited as their last.  It was 4 AM."

            "review": "I love Red Square and go there every time I go to Vegas. The attention to detail that went into designing this place is quite impressive. The decor is fashioned after and inspired by communist-era Russia and the bar is made out of dry ice. I have only consumed various vodka drinks here so cannot attest to the food, but they have an extensive caviar selection to pair with their vodka selection, which is vast. I usually get a straight, dry martini with some kind of high end russian vodka. This comes ice cold with a blue cheese stuffed olive at the bottom, soaking up all the booze. I have yet to do the vodka flight inside the subzero vodka freezer but that will be next on the agenda."

            "review": "I was very skeptical about this place as the menu didn't really scream Russian and these big Vegas hotel restaurants can be so pretentious, all-talk-no-show. However, I was beyond pleasantly surprised as the service ended up really good and the the food was - dare I say - tremendous. \nThe meal actually started off on a bad note, but the recovery is why I give them 5 stars. We ordered a decent bottle of wine, maybe $90, which is probably cheap in Vegas hotel terms. They did the typical pour, taste thing and, for the first time in my life, I actually couldn't stand the wine. It wasn't just warm, it was hot. Like it had sat on or near a heater. I asked my coworker to taste it and he was equally put off. So we asked them to go chill it. They didn't mind at all and actually brought us a new bottle that was at an appropriate temp. Everyone has problems, it is how you make up for them that counts and they did a great job.\nAs for the food, we ordered a dozen oysters. Considering it is the middle of the desert, you might expect mediocre oysters, but these were killer! Served with a nice mignonette sauce. I ordered a steak that was cooked perfectly and tasted delish. Everyone at the table remarked how great their meal was as well. I hope to go back some day, after winning big, and eating my weight in caviar."

            "review": "The front of the restaurant was taken over by a private event. Per the recommendations on Yelp and FourSquare, I got the lobster spaghetti. Maybe the kitchen was having a bad night, but it was truly awful. Tinned tomatoes and a minimal amount of lobster. I was underwhelmed by the appetizers as well. Everything was under seasoned. My bf got the stroganoff and the short rib was super tasty. The noodles were inedible. All of the salt that was previously missing was stored there. The drinks were well mixed and the server went above and beyond. I'd happily go back for drinks, but skip the food. Not worth it with all the other amazing options in this town."

            "review": "My friend and I made reservations here for their $95 New Years Eve pre-fix menu since we were attending the Mandalay Bay Block Party, and I had been wanting to eat here for quite some time.  Overall it was a good experience, good food and great service.  \n\nFood\n- Amuse:  \"Caviar\" (caviar filled beggar's purse) - this was actually very good.  It was filled with some type of extremely creamy cheese that had a strong flavor.  I love cheese so this was good in my book.  The beggar's purse evened out the creamyness and added a nice balance.\n\n- Appetizer: \"Crab Cake\" (jumbo lump crab, shaved white asparagus, Russian  remulade) - the crab cake was fairly large in size and tasted good, although very standard.  There was not an overwhelming amount of filler & outside had a nice crisp to it.  The asparagus was very crunchy so if you like crunchy, you'd like this...however, I was not a fan as I prefer my asparagus cooked fully.  The remulade was good but did not stand out; it reminded me of thousand island dressing.\n\n- Salad:  \"Crispy Goat Cheese Salad\" (baby argula, granny smith apples, endive, champagne vinegrette) - lovvvveeedd the salad!  Again, I am a huge cheese fan so this was great.  The cheese was a perfect crisp, atop of the bed of greens.  The vinegrette was light and refreshing, and not too overpowering.\n\n- Entree:  \"Scallops\" (seared jumbo sea scallops, lobster mashed potatoes, charred tomato relish) - although no scallops have been able to touch the ones I had at RM Seafood (flippin' amazing), I was still a fan.  The presentation could have been better, as all three scallops ranged widely in size and looked like they were slopped on top of the taters.  The taters were standard, and I'm not sure they should have included \"lobster\" in the title, as I encountered one SMALL piece of lobster.  The charred tomato relish was very tangy.\n\n- Dessert:  \"Chocolate Caviar\" (crunchy chocolate pearls, strawberry creme fraiche, vanilla blini) - I didn't like the creme, it almost reminded me of yougurt with a very strong \"yogurty\" taste.  The chocolate pearls tasted like dark chocolate and were good, however you had to sift thru to the bottom of the creme to get to them.  Vanilla blini was a tad dry.\n\nFor drinks I had some type of martini, (can't remember the name & can't find the drink menu online) which was very good.  It was strong, not too sweet and refreshing.  It had grapefruit juice which balanced out the flavors.  It came garnished with a huge wedge of grapefruit, so big it kind of made us laugh.  A champagne toast accompanied dessert, which was good.\n\nOverall the food presentation was good, minus the scallops.  The service was spectacular- our server was very friendly and personable, the host girls were cute and welcoming upon arrival.  Timing of the food was just about perfect, the courses were spaced out very well.  I really liked the enviroment, as it had an almost old Russia feel...the lighting was very dim and red which added to the experience.  I also like the fact it's off Mandalay's casino floor. \n\nBy no means was the food the absolute best I've ever had, however it still good warrants a return visit.  Putting together the  atmosphere, service and food, Red Square was an overall good experience and there are many other menu items, including their extensive vodka selection, I would like to try...  The statue of Lenin out front is really f'n cool as well, I'm a fan."

            "review": "This place was really good. I would definitely go back here. The service was impeccable. I love gin so I'm not to familiar with vodka so I asked the waiter to recommend a vodka that goes good with tonic. He recommended the black vodka which the name of escapes me right now. Really good and we even found a local restaurant that carries it too so the recommendation keeps going. \n\nThe ambiance is strange I thought it was to dark but that was around the time I found out I needed glasses, so that could be me. Now to the food... Um really good. My husband had some type of duck with the  foie gras that was delicious and I had fettuccine with lobster and black truffles. I want some right now. \n\nHad a great time here and will probably go back the next time we are in Vegas."

Our waiter, Joe, was so personable and knowledgeable. He recommended the Zyr vodka, which I had mixed with soda. Smooth and addictive. \n\nThe tuna tartare appetizer is heaven. The fish is fresh and the caviar egg on top was a nice Russian twist. They drizzle the plate with wasabi infused creme fraiche, which complimented the tuna beautifully. The goat cheese fritter over field greens with raspberry vinaigrette was also very good. Hubby had the surf and turf with melted blue cheese. It was incredible. \n\nBeing from NY, Joe warned us not to order the lime meringue topped cheesecake, but I didn't listen. Unfortunately, it was bland. He immediately offered to take it off our bill. What a nice touch considering I may not have even asked."

Very upscale,  very busy, very noisy - we felt as if we were where the action was...and we were!\n\nThe Truffle Fettuccine and Roquefort Filet Minon melted on our tongues, and the strawberry rom desert  was out of this world.  You've never seen a salad like the Czar Salad...share one with your significant other and the rest of the evening will be a blur (well, the shots helped with that).\n\nAnd you can't go to Red Square and not have a vodka shot now can you?\n\nIf you're looking for a place to have that one extravagant dinner & drinks evening, this should definitely be on your short list."

A group of eight of us were celebrating a birthday and decided to sit at the bar around 5pm. The place was pretty much empty besides four people at the end of the bar. We sat for about 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged by the bartender. Don't know her name but she was blonde with tattoos. The bartender ignored questions and told us we could not take pics in a part of the restaurant because,\"It's for VIPs only\".  I was told they had vodka samplers that are served on a red block of ice. The bartender said they didn't serve the samplers on ice anymore (One of the main reasons the BDay girl wanted to come here). My friend ordered a Moscow Mule and received it in a glass not a copper mug as it is on the menu and basically anywhere you order it.  When asked about the copper mug the bartender said they didn't have them.  Another friend pointed them out behind the bar. The bartender told my friend they only had two mugs and they were for VIPs only. The bartender seemed to not want us there and we were happy to oblige. The reason i gave two stars was due to the ice bar and the apps. Would of been a cool place to hang out and celebrate but the customer service was awful. At least the dealers smile at me before they take my money. My friends and I come to Vegas two to three times a year and will find another place spend our money."

(When I noticed it one of my friends was like, \"I wonder why there's a picture of John Lennon in a Russian-themed restaurant,\" and we just laughed. Obviously, we had Beatles on the brain). The DRINKS ARE AWESOME. If you like vodka...you'l love this place. The vodka list is most impressive. A group of guys at a bachelor party asked if we could take pictures with the groom-to-be, and, when in Vegas, flirting with bachelors is mandatory. They sent us a round of martinis afterwards (very gentlemanly), and we were sloshed. \n\nThe downside: the food was only okay, and very expensive. I tried a pasta with lobster and alfredo sauce that cost around $40ish and it was not that good at all. My friend had steak and it was better, but not the best either. \n\nThe bottom line...most certainly go for drinks, but eat dinner elsewhere. There is better food to be had in Vegas for the same expensive prices."

I, who have hated fish and seaweed and lobster and crab (etc) all of my life, enjoyed Mr. Mixer's caviar.  Really!

The booths on the left are very nice and the atmosphere is very conducive to a small group of friends chatting.  \n\nThe cocktail prices are fitting of the establishment. AKA overpriced, but you have to know that going in.  I mistakenly ordered the hot pepper martini and imagine it to be very similar to drinking battery acid without the lingering physical damages to your face.  Keep in mind, I LOVE spicy/hot food. I can do shots of Tapatio and Jalapenos for days on end.  This martini was horrid.  The taste etc was as if they had just gotten Albertsons charcoal filtered jug vodka and mixed in paint thinner.  Everyone elses drink was ok but nothing to write home about."

Now me and the friend got two drinks to start with which i know the are known for their vodkas obviously she got the signature martini bad idea since shes never had a martini but it was drinkable for her and i thought it was ahhhmazing i got a vodka water with lime very smooth and everything you would expect from a good vodka cant remember the name soooorry.  We got the five course menu tasting starting with the caviar which i have never had i thought it was good not to fishy and a nice burst of flavor. second course was steak tartar which i also have never had but absolutely looooved i will definitely order again the presentation was beautiful with toast points nice and light not too crunchy... yum yum yum be careful with the anchovies though ha.  Then came the salad with a light dressing perfect. The intermezzo was a tiny shot glass with balls of sorbet and champagne poured over it i could have ate an entire bowl of just that!! next came my beef stroganoff now this is not your mothers beef stroganoff this is heaven in a bowl filet mignon slices peas baby pearl onions and fresh pasta with a darker sauce rather than cream sooooo good.  Then came desert which was our individual huuuuuuuuge creme brulees absoolutely ahhmazing.... \n\nThen we had to run  to see the Lion king another thing i would recommend"

The martini I had was great. For food, I ordered a caesar salad and the beef stroganoff. The caesar salad was fine, but a complete waste of money. It was so tiny and uninventive. The beef stroganoff was not at all what I was expecting, but very tasty. It was a huge piece of short rib accompanied with mushroom-flavored noodles.  All combined, it was delicious and wonderful. The short rib had a lot of flavor. Overall, the bill was way too high for what I actually received. But the stroganoff sure was tasty."

Note that although their webpage is on the Mandalay Bay website, they're actually not under that corporate umbrella, and the info on the page tends to be out of date.  Stop by the front desk or call to get the real details of their happy hour/etc.\n\nI keep coming back for the Beef Pelmeni on the bar menu - little warm beef dumplings in broth served with a yogurt sauce.\n\nTheir cavi-hour is a good deal - during certain hours, it's a half ounce of caviar free when you get two drinks made with Russian Standard Vodka.  Sure - the drinks are not cheap - it's Las Vegas - but the Caviar actually makes this an excellent deal.\n\nThey also have a small vodka vault.  Apparently, they rent out storage lockers in there, but you can also buy a bottle of vodka and spend some time in the vault in fur coats doing shots off the top of the decapitated head of the statue of Lenin they have out front.  They let you buy a half bottle ( still about $100 ) if there's only two of you, and you can take the part you don't finish home with you.  It's kind of cold in there, but a cool experience.  Our bartender came in with us and told us a little about the vault and the folks who pay thousands to store their vodka in there.\n\nHaving been here a couple times now, I really like this place."

Most of this bar is red, and there is a lovely community table in the middle of the bar that you can sit at and enjoy your martini, or if you don't feel like talking to strangers, and you think community = communism,  there are other places to enjoy your beverage as well.\n\nThe bar is swanky.  and if you sit at the bar, it is essentially one long sheet of ice, and you can enjoy your cocktail at the proper temperature  Its not the whole bar...just the top.  It keeps the drinks cold. \n\nThe bartenders have flair.  Myself, Eric W. and a few of his friends all ordered martinis at the same time.  The bartender stacked the glasses all pyramid style, took the shakers, put them all together, and poured each individual martini at the same time, with a perfect pour, not a drop spilled.  It was awesome, and I bet the communists would have been proud.  \n\nIf you are going to spill a drink on yourself, make sure its one that smells good...just ask Eric.  He ended up smelling of key lime all evening.  It was delicious.  I just enjoyed that martini, which had plain ol' vanilla vodka, stuff to make it limey and a graham cracker crust rim.  However, if you are looking for something stiffer, more potent, more raw....this is the place.  The Russians sure do like their vodka, and this is the drink of choice here.  Just look at the menu.\n\nApparently, if you'd like to visit with Lenin's head and tell him what you think of the bar and the vodka selection, it's frozen inside a block of ice inside the \"vodka locker,\" a walk-in freezer containing much of the bar's stock.  This is where they put the good shit."

You can have a shot of it in a cocktail here for $13. Worth it? Depends on how much you value the cocktail over the 10 seconds of the guy pouring it with great flourish into a pyramid of glasses. \nI lost count of the number of cocktails using Sierra Mist. \n\nWe got the tasting menu, at $65 each +$10 for foie gras. The food was good, but overshadowed (pun intended) by such a dark interior we could hardly see it. Dark restaurants don't do service to the dishes, it makes me think there's something to hide about the food. \nThe most our server could offer up by way of describing the dishes and highlighting its best qualities was to say the plating was \"really cool, huh.\" \n\nMy feeling is that Red Square doesn't appreciate its own food.

To say the tables are too close together would be an understatement.\n\nNot bathroom in the actual restaurant was a real downer.  No patron of any restaurant should be told to leave the restaurant in order to go to the restroom.  Big minus points there.\n\nOverall the food was good.  The decor was themed perfectly and very attractive.  However, the lack of any real intimate space and lack of onsite bathroom facilities necessitate the 3 star rating."

            "review": "While the atmosphere is interesting, the menu is good in theory, and the food isn't so terrible, this is just another run-of-the-mill, overpriced, gimmicky strip restaurant with the same dishes with slight twists. Ahi tuna, salmon, pork tenderloin, rack of lamb, lobster ravioli or pasta, and steaks, as on every other menu I looked at that week. Sometimes duck, and when it is, 95% of the time it's a combo of the grilled breast and the confit prepared separately. As always, the obligatory chicken dish, too.\n\nThe other drawback to Red Square was the insipid trip hop that droned the entire time I was there, and the clientele that seemed to enjoy it while sipping their $17 froo froo martinis. Must have been on company money, or they're out of their minds.\n\nThe traditional beef tartare was very good, and not more than I would expect to pay a hamburger-sized \"patty\" of raw beef. I'm glad they kept it simple and didn't try to do anything original.\n\nMy duck was not bad. It would have been good for, say, $13, but I think it was close to $40. I wasn't able to finish it, not because I was full, but also not because it was horrible. I guess a taste of it would have been enough.\n\nI'd give it two and a half if I could, but for the sake of offsetting rating inflation, two."

The salmon dish (I'm not going to try to spell the actual menu name of the dish) was excellent as well. A perfectly cooked piece of fresh salmon, on top of a mushroom and potato mixture, and topped with a piece of buttery puff pastry and an excellent cream sauce. Oh yes! \n\nThe wine list was a little weak (the Vodka list isn't!) but I did get a very good glass of Cab. \n\nThe service was a little slow to start and perhaps a bit rushed at the end of the meal, but that's really pretty minor in the scheme of things.

The short ribs melted in my mouth, and I would certainly order it again.\n\nThe atmosphere was interesting. It was very dark, and a bit difficult to see the menu at times.

We did a bottle of Vodka with dinner, I highly recommend this if you plan on having more then 5 drinks at your table as the bottle does come with full service and mixers at no additional charge less the individual gratuity they request.  The bonus on ordering the bottle is gaining access to the Vodka Vault, a below zero freezer where they keep these find bottles of clear liquor.  If you purchase a bottle, of any value, you will be given private access to the vault with mink coats, in addition to shot glasses accompanying your bottle of vodka... which can later be taken off of Stalin's head inside of the chilled room.  The food was spectacular, I split a steak and salad with my wife and it was amazing, not to mention a way to save a couple of bucks on the final bill.\n\nOur service was good, not spectacular and the booth in which we sat was very tight fit for a 6' 3\" man...\n\nI highly recommend and definitely plan on eating at again."

Overall, it was a good experience and I'd go back on a future trip, but it wasn't knock-my-socks off enough to get five stars.\n\nI hadn't checked the restaurant out beforehand since my friend made the reservation same-day, and I have to say I was a little disappointed in having so few choices for food. The cocktail menu was nice - I had the Red Dawn instead of my typical Moscow Mule, and it was good but not particularly strong. For an appetizer we had the Siberian Nachos. They were good, but I was disappointed at the tiny dab of maybe five or six roe that constituted the caviar portion. I was also extremely surprised to see them come on basically a Ruffles potato chip. I was expecting a blini. For an entree, I had the Beef Stroganoff, and it was really delicious. The beef was so tender it just fell apart, and the noodles and sauce were spot-on. That was enough to make me come back. Because our friends had a show to make, we didn't have dessert.\n\nOur server (Brandon, I think?) was very friendly and gave good recommendations for the menu. The only real issue we had was that the food was coming out of the kitchen a little slow. When my friend mentioned they had a show to make, the dishes came out only a few minutes later.\n\nThe decor is interesting - eclectic for sure. It's definitely not pitch dark like one reviewer mentioned. They were also nice enough to give our party a table in the center of the room, so we had a good view of what was going on outside and at the bar. \n\nDespite a couple of minor complaints, I'd return on my next trip and would recommend it to others."

I think their happy hour pricing and the selection the offer for happy hour is really good for it being a restaurant in a casino on the strip. Their food menu actually has some good finds - salmon pizza, duck fat fries, meatballs, kobe beef sliders, etc. And the prices, again, for being on the strip are not bad. My friend and I shared the Duck Fat Fries with a side of aioli and tomato jam. Each dipping sauce added a little different taste to the fries. These fries are definitely an acquired taste and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone just desiring regular old french fries. Never the less I though they were tasty and the tomato jam was truly a different type of taste, one I've never really experienced before.\n\nDrink prices are also pretty decent. I had two glasses of pinot noir ($12). There are also well drinks and about four beers on the happy hour as well.\n\nMy friend also ordered a blackberry and peach pie off the dessert menu. It came out as a round little personal pie, not a slice with a scoop of ice cream and caramel. Um, the caramel came out in a little pot and was solidified. I honestly think they forgot to warm it up so it would pour before they brought out the plate. The pie itself was quite tasty, nice crust, and the fruit inside was not overly sweet.\n\nThe one thing here is service is a bit on the slow side, especially since it is packed during happy hour. My friend and I had to wave down the busser to get our check to our waitress who hadn't been back to our table to retrieve it. As we were trying to get to a concert this miffed us a bit. So just remember that when dining here. \n\nOverall I would come back here for happy hour and reccomend it to anyone seeking a happy hour that is a bit \"different\" on the strip."

Premium caviar choices were replaced with second rate stuff, portions were much smaller on the appetizers as well as main dishes, and the overall presentation was seriously lacking.  My cesar salad was brown and mostly iceberg lettuce slathered in somethinig that did not resembled cesar dressing. I had the Chicken Kiev-over cooked, greesy and gross.  My date had the tasting menu, I'll let him yelp that one, but I was unimpressed.  \nOn the good side: The bar selection offers an extensive vodka list as well as great mixed drinks. The dinner rolls were good. And, it's pretty neat inside, Lenin's head with the Vodka's was pretty cool.  Worth a stop for drinks, don't stay for dinner.\n\nI'm sure there are many other better choices for dinner in Vegas, try them out."

I loved the peach bellini from the ice bar, the buttery chicken kiav, the creamy beef stroganoff, and the chocolate caviar dessert. I had celebrated many birthdays and meals before concerts at this place.\n\nIt had been a few years since I had gone back but I was there this last July. I was told with new management they no longer make my favorite peach bellini. That annoyed me. How could they get rid of it!  I ordered the chicken kiav. It was so disappointing. There was no butter in the dish and it was intensely dry. That's what chicken kiav is;  moist chicken filled with butter and crispy on the outside. It was filled with some green vegetable. I couldn't even tell what it was. My husband did not like his steak and my sister felt the same way about her chicken kiav. After that I knew I was never going back and this ruined it for me. This experience made me sad since I always loved this place.\n\nOf course the dessert menu changed and I was not into the strawberry baked alaska. The service was standard and in my opinion dining here was not worth the high price. I have nothing else to say."

The atmosphere is fantastic, and the food used to be stellar. Sadly, I'm not sure if they changed owners/management, but the last time I was there, the vibe was completely different. For one, they no longer had my favorite menu item - the steak tartare, which was one of the best I've had. I was barely getting over that disappointment when I realized that their signature item, the beef stroganoff, was completely changed as well. I ordered it anyway, and while the new version was a perfectly fine braised short rib and noodles, it was nothing like the rich, creamy deliciousness with thick homemade noodles and crispy potatoes that made the old version so special. Their drink menu was also presented to me in an iPad, which completely clashed with the old school Russian atmosphere. Finally, the service was terribly slow due to a large demanding party that our server was dealing with. However, they comped us a very nice bottle of Cabernet when I complained, so props to them for that. All in all, I guess if you haven't been before, it might be ok, but personally I feel like the recent changes were completely off the mark and very disappointing. It seems way too kitschy and touristy now, and I doubt I will go back."

First, the price point is much too high. We ordered two shots of mid range Polish vodka, a crab cake appetizer, and a caviar sampler. The caviar was a trio of domestic caviars, with the basic trimmings; between the three types, we received less than half of an ounce of caviar. These items together cost $150.00 plus tip. In comparison, when we went to Red Square before, we could get two shot of Russian platinum premium vodka and a half ounce of good quality black caviar with all of the trimmings for $35.00 Sticker shock much? Second, the new menu is standard American. It may be well prepared, but there is no reason to choose Red Square over any other restaurant in Vegas. It is boring. In contrast, the old menu was distinctive. The caviar came with blinis as well as toast points and the other trimmings. You could order a delightful perogis in consomm\u00e9 and several other Russian dishes in small sizes or as full meals. Red Square used to be a distinctive destination in its own right, but no longer. I will miss it.\n\nMy friends and I used to love going to Red Square. In fact, we would make it a point to visit on every trip to Vegas (several times a year). Unfortunately, now that the restaurant has been bought out, we have no reason to return."

To start, my wife had a pomegranate martini and I went with the Russian Mary. (in my family, bloody marys are not just for brunch!)  I also had their standard Red Square martini, which was excellent.  We thought about doing the tasting menu, but it would have been just too much food.  We ended up splitting the crab-stuffed portobello mushroom to start, which was a good choice.  For dinner, we shared the butterfish and the stroganoff, with a side of asparagus.  Everything was delicious and we were too full for dessert, but it was a great meal!  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the excellent service.  Maybe I'm a jaded New Yorker, but all the waiters in Las Vegas are just so much friendlier!"

Well, the parts you can see anyway cause this is probably one of the darkest lit restaurants I have ever been to.  Tip: Use the flash on your phone to read the menu.  Well, as I was saying, it looks and feels like a heavily themed Disneyland ride, though a beautiful one,... and that's what you get with the food too: described to be luxurious on the menu with prices to reinforce, but served up cardboard.\n\n1. Moscow Mule $18: Says on the menu it's made up of vodka, lime, and ginger beer... and whadya know... it tastes just like that.  Yes, that's right, go home and mix your own vodka, lime, and beer and you got the same dang thing.  ZERO complexity.  Tastes fine as a girly drink--but you don't pay $18 for a cocktail you drink at your cheap company's holiday bash.  1/10.\n\n2. Salmon Pizza $21: Crap.  Utter crap.  I don't care if it has little tiny dabs of caviar and is covered in salmon.  The bread is a tasteless piece of cardboard, and this dish is hardly deserving of your hard-earned money.  1/10.\n\n3. Bone-In Ribeye Tomahawk $58: Straight up LIE.  It says \"24 Ounce, 2 Signature Sauces\" as a description.  Look... I've had honest 18oz steaks that I could barely finish, ...this is NOT 24oz.  I wolfed it cause it tastes good, but was still plenty hungry.  Note that this steak is extremely marinated--like it's completely saturated with some kind of marinade which really covers up the natural meat taste.  Yeah, I'd say it tastes good, but for $58, you don't pay for a plate of marinade.  $58 will buy you an amazing steak at Mastro's or Alexander's... this place has no right to serve this crap at that price.  3/10.\n\n4. Bread Pudding $9: OMG, one sanely priced item.  Too bad it doesn't taste that great.  Your local diner will probably serve better.  Well on that note, there is one curiosity--do I spy Captain Crunch Cereal covering the dish!?!?  (See my pictures!--seriously.) I don't get it.  I mean, did they attempt to try to make Captain Crunch in-house?--or is that really the stuff you buy at the super market?  Well, if they made it, it sure tastes like Captain Crunch.  Would an ultra-high-end fancy-pants I-got-$300-caviar restaurant dare put Captain Crunch on a dessert???  Sigh... 4/10.\n\nIf you think I'm just joking around and you think the current 4-stars it has on Yelp could be correct... go right ahead.  Just promise me you'll get the bread pudding and ask for some milk--tell the waiter that you will need it to go with your cereal.\n\n1/5.\n\n#Russian #vegas #overpriced #avoid #touristtrap"

So I decided to try it again and see if they are consistent. They have gone way downhill. First off the ginger beer did not taste like fever tree and if it was, then it was very old it had a gross aftertaste. I have tried every brand and it actually tasted like they were using Reeds which is my least favorite brand. They also started using toto's vodka which to me tastes cheap. We ordered off the Pre-Fixe menu again and this time I got the lobster bisque which was really good but also very spicy, I got the chicken Kiev and they brought me a butter knife to cut it up and that did not do the job it was so tough I couldn't cut it so more than 3/4 of it was left on the plate. Don't even get me started on the dessert. Again they said it was vanilla ice cream. I declined. Then the server came back out and said actually they had lemon sorbet that night so I decided I'd give it a try since it came with dinner. The second the spoon hit my mouth I regretted my decision. The lemon sorbet was literally I think, the same vanilla ice cream from one year ago that had probably gone bad but they wanted to still serve so they put some lemon zest in there to try and pass it off as lemon sorbet. It was the most powdery disgusting ice cream mess I have ever tasted. I stopped short of spittinf it out, but only because this is supposed to be a nice place. Save your money, there are much better restaurants very close by. Skip this place."

I would think with the economy places would be making their promos better, but it seems a lot of restaurants have made their promos worth by jacking up prices and decreasing portions. \n\nDrinks were tasty, but honestly I'd prefer grey goose if given the choice instead of the russian imperial. The pomegranate cocktail on the 2nd page was our favoriret. Caviar on the caviar hour was decent. It was the tiny kind (which I love), but it had more fish and less salt than I like in flavor. The sides that come with the caviar is why this place gets 4 stars.. wow! Fresh hot blinis, toast, eggs, onions, creme fraiche.. truly the works. \n\nOverall still a great place for happy hour - especially if you LOVE caviar like I do! At $90 for 4 drinks + some caviar, it's more of a splurge type place and less of a deal."

Red Square is one of them.  \n\nYes, admittedly, the bar made of ice (normal bar but with a patch of ice running down the middle to set your drink on or play with if you are a strange person) was the deciding factor on entering this bar.  Just walking in and seeing the amazing architecture, chandeliers, and unique 3-story painting on the wall was worth the time.  I saw the place almost as a Haunted Mansion...but one you can sip delicious beverages at!\n\nI don't drink martinis and hardly drink while we are at it.....but these cocktails that the highly socially gifted bartender, Kerry, made for us were out of control.  Key Lime Pie Martini rimmed with graham crackers and their House Vodka infused with Mango Martini both rocked the taste buds and soothed the mood.  \n\nAlthough I didn't get to dine at this fine establishment, I will definitely be back again at least for another cocktail. This place will be at Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino for a long time!"

Staying in the Mandalay Bay, we wanted a place which could accomodate gluten intolerants, a vegetarian, children, and a steak loving husband. Red Square was literally able to accomodate all off one menu.\n\nWe had a table for 12 which I was pleasantly unexpected was semi-private. The lighting was adjustable which was awesome as we got to somewhat pick our mood. We ordered a few bottles of wine from the extensive wine list and each bottle was amazing. Somewhat annoyingly though, the gluten intolerants and vegetarian had to take turns with the special menu as they only brought the one. \n\nI skipped appies (having to not have my dress burst at the seams and all), and had the Filet Mignon for my entree. I'm not a huge red meat eater, but this was a fantastic dish I would order again.  My husband was in steak heaven. All children ate. Gluten intolerants (myself included) were happy), and even the vegatarian was impressed. Dessert was Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee which I now regularly crave and must go back there just to eat. \n\nOur server was good. He was  accomodating and friendly for the duration of the meal (we were there for about 3 hours), my only complaint was we had a bit of a slow start... I got a little bit impatient waiting to order wine, however after that he was much prompter."

The bride had been told about a bar and said we must go find it, and well, whatever the bride wants, the bride gets on her wedding day!  We entered Red Square ready to toast the happy couple Russian-style (meaning with plenty of vodka).\n\nAfter being greeted by the super sweet host who told us we could sit wherever we wanted with a big ol' grin on his face and many congratulations to our friends we found ourselves right in front of the bar and tried to get our eyes adjusted to the red light. From where we were sitting you could feel the cold coming off the ice-topped bar which we would've loved to have sat at but it was full.  The walls look like they have been half-torn down and are covered with old propaganda posters -- gotta love Vegas theme-bars! It was all looking good for us, that is, until \"bitter waitress\" came to our table....sigh....\n\n\"Bitter waitress\" just couldn't seem to get her attitude straight the whole time we were there and I can't explain how much service adds to your opinion of this place. I am just gonna say this one time:\n\n*People in the service industry -- I don't care if this isn't your \"real\" job and you are really an actor/writer/director/painter/musician/dancer with a heart of gold - whatever. When you are at your place of work please remember you are an employee there, you are at a job and you really really should take whatever job you have been given seriously. If you don't like doing it, do something else! Think of it this way -- this job, this \"thing I don't really do, I'm really a ----\" is paying for you to be able to be a -----. Be grateful! Do not be bitter or stupid and waste my experience and money with your sour attitude. Be responsible, be an adult - be good at your job! It's not rocket science.*\n\n.......\n\nOK! Sorry! *Steps down off the Lenin statue* Back to the real review....\n\nWe had two flights - the USSR and the Best of the Motherland. Eight shots total for a group of six and we all just passed each one around and tasted with a sip or so. Actually, if you do it that way it ends up being a pretty good deal as the flights are in the forty to fifty dollar range.  Then my group decided to get a couple more drinks and all in all the bill was about $100. Not bad, not bad at all!  One drink in particular, their apple martini, was made with whiskey, not vodka and I will tell you what - it converted me! Honestly, it changes the flavor of the drink and for me personally its for the better.  (and it is always a hard fight whether I am more in love with whiskey or vodka at the moment)\n\nI found a couple new vodkas I loved, ( I would love to share, but the website doesn't have a menu) we started the night off right for the newlyweds and although we missed the vodka room (where I guess you get to wear furs and do shots) I would say Red Square did us right -- \nSpasibo!"

I was staying at Mandalay Bay, so the location was convenient, about a 5 minute walk from the door of my room to the restaurant. It was almost dead on a Monday around 7, and we got in just in time to grab a happy hour drink. We sat at the bar until they had a table ready for us, and the bar is made of long piece of ice with vodka bottles frozen in! It's pretty cool (literally) and I couldn't stop digging into the ice. I had the KGB, which was delicious, and I can't remember what my companion had.\nTIP: check in for a free well drink!\n\nOnce we were moved to our cozy booth, which was romantically lit by fringed lamps, we were greeted by our server and took both of his recommendations for meals - the dumplings for a starter, and the short rib stroganoff for our entree. I didn't know what to expect with either dish, so I was pleasantly surprised when the dumplings came out and they were delicious crispy pierogies! Unfortunately, there was an odd number of the dumplings, so it was a fight over the last one. I thought that these were a must-order.\n\nThe entree took a strangely long time to arrive in a restaurant that was so dead. I highly recommend the short rib stroganoff, though. The short rib was so succulent and the mushrooms were so flavorful and there was a dollop of some sort of creamy cheese on top of the noodles that was so decadent and it really tied this dish together.\n\nWe had a really good time here, and I would highly recommend stopping here for those two dishes alone!"

It's a great photo opp with your date, spouse, or friends along with an experience you'll never forget.\n\nI've lived in this town for over a decade and I firmly believe this place should be on everyone's Vegas bucket list.

Red Square looks great in an ironic soft of way, with busts of Lenin and workers revolution posters in a shrine to capitalism. \nWe chose the prix fixe menu because that would give us the greatest variety. It was pricey, but we hoped worth it, and we could share. Caviar appetizer was overwhelmed by sugar cookie wrap, and the foie gras also battled against the brioche and sweet berry jam. I know this is a current way of presenting foie gras, but the balance was off. \nSalt and pepper calamari was barely a step above TGIFriday food. The filet mignon was a tender, but slathered with an overwhelming blue cheese sauce. My Beef Stroganoff (the only thing on the entire menu that can be called Russian) was tasty but meh. I could have been having this meal at any old place and for much less. Same thoughts for the dessert.\nYes, they have a huge vodka menu. The cocktail menu, though two pages, didn't have too many surprises. I nixed anything with pre-made mixes and soda (Sierra Mist!!) and narrowed it down to only a few to choose. The one I got was okay, nothing to write Moscow home about.\nServer was okay, but did keep returning with rhetorical questions like \"isn't the plating of this food beautiful?\" Er...\nSome older reviews suggest this place was once good.

This is one of the original \"ice\" bars, with a a strip of ice running down the middle of the bar and an ice vault where you can do vodka shots of Stalin's head. They have an enormous menu of vodka shots, drinks and other alcohol. The servers are attentive and friendly, and you never have to wait for a drink very long.\nThe decor is dark, red and plush, and almost feel like your in a bar in Russia. THe decor has not changed since I've been going, but it serves the bar well! I have never eaten there, so I can't review the food.\n As long as it's there, I will be a return customer!"

Always loved this restraunt . Not any more and will NEVER recommend it again. We were given a 10 pm reservation and arrived at 9.50 . When we got to the front we were told by the hostess did we want to get seated because the kitchen closes at 10. First mistake we should have run then. Why would the kitchen close at 10 on a Saturday night and more importantly why would you seat a party of 6 at 10w ith a closed kitchen . So here we go off to the races . Four different waters were doing hit and runs at our table they would ask the same questions and never come back with what we asked for . Then the one of the waitresses came over and we then were hurried into ordering and she forgot to take one of my clients orders . 25 Minuted in no water at the table and no drinks . The music was so loud we could not even hear the waiters asking us things . We asked 4 times to be moved or to have the table moved . each time we were told just a moment it is loud the music was never adjusted . The table next to us had the same requests  they were ignored as well. One plate arrived at the 50 minute mark a salad still no drinks . Then an ice tea arrived in a dirty g lass through the whole dinner I asked for it to be replaced never  was . Finally after asking for the manger for twenty minutes I got up went through the restraunt until i was able to corner him to tell him what was going on . He was going to get us moved and get things fixed a man of few words and a vacant stare when you ask to get tings addressed . Never saw him again ,we were never moved our food came out cold bread never came ,wine bottle never arrived and drinks were not re filled . To top it off we were never offered dessert ,our side dishes were undercooked and the seafood came out with veins in the shrimp nice way to get the guests sick . Two steaks were cooked wrong . Just a mess one big embarrassing mess for an evening out entertaining . The manager has no skills for correcting problems and I certain the staff is a big hot mess because he requires no organization guest service or follow through $500 dollars later we left scratching our heads and in the future I will take my business elsewhere ."

We were going to start out with the vodka vault so that we could get all dressed up in the fur coats and hats but decided last minute that the required minimum bottle for $200 to get you in wasn't worth it to us. However, if you don't finish the bottle, they give you unlimited mixers at your table or you can even bring it home with you. Unfortunately we were heading out for a long night and we didn't want to carry the bottle around with us.\n\nOn to the food - we ordered the Siberian Nachos, Stroganoff, Salmon, Chicken Kiev, and Skirt Steak. Everything was delicious!!! I'm not a smoked salmon fan so that didn't do it for me, but the rest of the table loved every bite. Also, the portions here were really generous. None of us were able to finish our plates because we were all so full. But if I could have stuffed one more bite into my mouth without feeling like a whale I would have because it was that good.\n\nThe drinks - we tried so many martinis. Since they're famous for their vodka drinks, we didn't hold back and they were worth it. Strong and not overly-sweet which I can't stand. So they get a big thumbs up from us on that note. \n\nSpasiba for a great night out Red Square!"

The waiter Patrick seemed more content on talking to other tables then servicing ours.  \nComplaint #2 - isn't this supposed to be a Russian restaurant?  the only 2 items that could be considered Russian were Chicken KIev and Beef Stroganoff.  the rest was just regular american fare - very disappointing.\nComplaint #3 - we wanted to order the seafood platter but was told it is not on the menu any longer.  another disappointment.  when we left the hostess ask us why and we told her and she said they always make the seafood platter on request - guess management forgot to inform there waiters.\n\n\nOverall I cannot rate the food but from what I have been reading below, we didn't miss anything and I'm glad we didn't spend our money there.

Sign me up!\" Then I looked at the food menu and decided I really, really needed to go here.\n\nSo my boyfriend and I ventured over here for dinner the first night of our most recent Vegas trip. It's a good thing that he also likes vodka, because we ordered a lot. We ordered two flights (Around the World and USSR), stupidly expecting Utah-sized samples. When the eight full shots came out, we were a little overwhelmed. However, good vodka must be consumed! Around the World was the clear winner here. I was already quite familiar with Vox, and the vodkas from Poland and Iceland were first rate. \n\nThen we ate some food, because you have to soak that vodka up with something, right? Oh, this wasn't just something! I got the angel hair pasta with crab meat, because I was totally in the mood for pasta. This is one of those dishes that can easily be unremarkable, but the freshness of the crab meat and the subtle but awesome spices of the tomato sauce made this one to remember. It must be noted, though, that my boyfriend's Roquefort Filet Mignon blew my entree (and most food in general) out of the water. Tender, tasty meat + delicious blue cheese = epic win. \n\nOh, but we weren't done! We decided we were not yet done with drinking and ordered the dessert shot flight. We started with the key lime pie one to get it out of the way because neither of us really like key lime pie. This, however, was stellar. I think that when Camilla asked Dexter to find her the perfect key lime pie, she should have totally brought her this shot. Not saying anything other than that because I don't want to put a Dexter spoiler alert in my food review! Anyway, that was followed by two coffee flavored shots which ruled, and a banana shot that was the perfect end to a perfect dinner. \n\nSo, the food and drinks were obviously awesome. Service was occasionally slow, but our server (Joseph) was very friendly and had some great recommendations. I was in love with the atmosphere: dim lights, vaguely hip music, Communist memorabilia. The hipster in me was so excited to be here. \n\nI trust that I will be back on future Vegas excursions."

I had no idea where to even start with their HUGE selection of vodkas surrounding me.  He asked me what my favorite fruit was and so I thought of the first thing that came to mind...strawberry!  He started mixing a couple of vodkas together and poured his concoction into a martini glass.  He added a fresh raspberry and blueberry to my drink and I took a sip. Yum!  My bf had a classic martini himself.  \n\nWe perused over the menu and although I was tempted by the caviar, I had to say no.  I was still full from my huge meal upstairs. \n\nWe were then invited to the vault.  Putting on the crazy hats and the crazy coats, we proceeded into this ice chamber for a shot of vodka.  I went for the Mango flavored vodka.  It went down smooth... \n\nI should mention...I'm not usually such a lightweight.  But as I started drinking my martini, I could feel it...damn, I'm getting buzzed already!  Wtf! So, you can imagine I was feeling pretty damn good by the time we left, and that was only after one martini and one shot.  Sheesh. \n\nAnyhow, when you're there...ask for JD to take care of you.  He's the cute Asian bartender with the funky glasses and the tats all over his arms.  Ask him to make something special for you! \n\nOverall, for the brief time I was at Red Square, I had such an interesting night.  We met the most interesting of people and witnessed the most interesting of things.  I'll definitely go back for some caviar and a seat at their ice bar.\n\nUpdate! 03/03/08 - Has it been so long since I've experienced the vodka vault?  We're lucky to swing by during their \"Cavi Hour\", which runs everyday from 4 pm to 6 pm.  With the purchase of two Imperia Vodka Cocktails per person, you receive 1 oz of caviar to enjoy while you sip your drinks.  What a decadent treat!  \n\nI enjoyed a mixed concoction of vodka and a bunch of fruity stuff.  The BF and another friend had their vodka straight up.  The real winner was their Russian Mary!  My oh my and what yum!  This mix has been sitting around for a little while and has some serious hotness to it.  They mix it with their Bloody Mary mix and top it off with a couple of blue cheese stuffed olives!  So delicious!  (And yes, I was getting a nice little buzz from here!)\n\nTheir caviar comes with triangle toasts, blinis, creme fraiche, red onions, hard-boiled egg whites and egg yolks, and chives.  And yes, I'm one of those people who would rather eat such loveliness without all the condiments 'cuz caviar just tastes so good!\n\nI do have to make it a better point to come here more often, and especially to take advantage of their Cavi Hour!  What a fabulous idea!\n\nUpdate! 07/20/09 - Reverse Happy Hour is from 11 pm to close, Sunday through Wednesday.  Half price cocktails and bar menu items.  Discounted bottles in their subzero vodka vault."

The afternoon we stopped by the bar was full, and the \"Red Tables' they designate for happy hour were pretty much full. There was enough room for about half of us to sit down and order drinks. The wait staff did their best by bringing a couple more chairs to put on the ends of the tables, but there just wasn't enough room for a party of 12 to sit down and enjoy cheap vodka drinks and burgers. We did not want to order food if the seating arrangements were not going to work out. The drinks we had were very good by the way, and the servers were fast and friendly with the drinks and our check when we decided to move on. \n\nThe rest of the tables in the bar area were empty, but they said they were for customers who were dining from the dinner menu, not the happy hour menu. Looking at the prices on their dinner menu, I can see that's where they are trying to make money. So why offer such an enticing happy hour, that runs longer than other bars and restaurants, if you can't accomodate the crowd? \n\nWill probably come back with my wife to actually get to try the happy hour menu, but wouldn't chance bringing a group again."

It's a quirky, cool place to go grab a martini, and I highly recommend it for that.  \n\nAs far as dinner, I ordered the Australian hazelnut crusted rack of lamb with cherry sauce.  I asked for the meat medium rare, which, in my opinion, is a great way to eat lamb.  It came and was much closer to rare, and in fact kind of grossed me out because it was so raw in the center.  Which is saying a lot, since I'm totally comfortable with rare meat, generally speaking.  It was just such a drastic difference from inside to outside, and not very appetizing.\n\nI would recommend the siberian nachos, however, which were essentially tuna tartar on wonton chips.  These were great!  \n\nMy friend ordered the special, a filet mignon, which he said was very good.   Maybe my meat situation was just a fluke.\n\nThe best part of dinner by far was the vodka menu.  It's awesome, and a lot of fun to look through together.  I ordered the Tall Blonde Vodka, up with a twist.  I was not disappointed, that was one awesome martini. \n\nThis is a unique place to come for drinks and apps, but I'm not sure dinner is worth the price.   Overall a good experience, though.  And a good place to impress, since they've got caviar on the menu for $200+.   If you're into that kind of thing."

Nice touch. \n\nI'm a lightweight, so that one martini was enough for me, but I did get to try some of my friends' drinks. The Chernobyl will knock you on your butt if you aren't careful, but it tastes like a yummy, barely alcoholic, fruit drink. You won't know what hit you until it's too late. \n\nThey also have an outstanding black cherry vodka/pinot noir martini that is really unique. I can't remember the name of it, but it's worth scouring the menu for. \n\nThe decor is elegant but cheesy, and the booths are the best spot to sit and people watch.

I believe I started at Stoli Elite (~$15/drink) and started to work my way up the menu.  Jewel of Russia makes a couple of different vodkas that were really good too.  Having downed a $30/drink bit of vodka, the next step on the menu was $80/drink.  I was tempted.  I'm glad my girlfriend stopped me when she did.  Kinda.\n\nThe service here was very attentive, professional and knowledgeable.  They make you want to stay here.\n\nReally fun place, definitely check it out.  Friends of mine have eaten here and said the food is good too."

Belvedere, sour apple, orange and pineapple juice, a splash of sierra mist and something else.  All the people that ordered the filet loved it.  I had the stroganoff.  It was good but a little salty.  The atmosphere was a little dark, we had to use our phone lights to read the menu, but after ordering and a couple of drinks, it was perfect.  It's a great place to stop if you don't want to leave Mandalay Bay or the Hotel for dinner."

            "review": "This place is a MUST for happy hour! \n\nCame here for some shareables before Britney Spears and everything was so freaking delicious! \n\nThe smoked salmon pizza is more like a little flatbread, garnished with pickled red onion, caviar, and capers, all on top a thin layer of creme fraiche. SO GOOD. Flavors all work beautifully together, and salmon has a very delicate smoked flavor. \n\nThe steak tartar bites were equally as delicious, served on little rounds of toasted bread brushed lightly with truffle oil. So simple yet so yummy. \n\nFinally, saved the best for last - the meatballs in 12 hour gravy. If you get anything, get these. Without a doubt some of the best meatballs I've ever had - and at a Russian joint? Who knew?! Meatballs are a generous portion served with ricotta and large pieces of grilled garlic bread. Heavenly goodness.\n\nI was so full by the end, but had there been anymore of anything I would've eaten it because it was all so freaking good - and happy hour prices are fantastic. \n\nDrinks are expensive so be prepared - cocktails run $18/piece and some vodkas run upwards of $60 for rocks pours. However the entire place is just a great experience so it's worth trying a cocktail or two while you're there. \n\nHighly recommend to everyone visiting Vegas.\n\nSide note: if you are not staying at Mandalay Bay, unlike the rest of Vegas, their parking garage is not free of charge."

The service was the worst I've ever experienced.  The food - some good, some bad.  On service I would give this 1 star, but the food saved it.  \n\nWe started with the stuffed portabello appetizer - pretty good.  I ordered a salad and my friend ordered the lobster bisque.  The lobster bisque was horrible!  Instead of a subtle lobster flavor it had a fowl fishy smell with a sharp metallic after-taste.  We sat and waited for our waiter to come by and check on us so we could return the soup - he completely ignored us.  I was confident he would return to at least offer some fresh pepper for my salad.  I was wrong.  The pepper grinder made it to other tables from other waiters, but our guy just kept returning to the bar to check the hockey score, and disappeared in the back room.  At one point I thought I caught his eye as I was trying to wave him down, but he turned around and went to another table.  Seriously, how can you just drop food in front of people and not ever go back to see if they need anything - fresh pepper, or whatever.  Finally he came by to see if we were done eating, and at that point I told him that the soup was inedible, and he took it away with no apologies.  When the manager came by, I told the manager the same, and I got \"we're looking into it\" back.  We're looking into it?  What the heck does that mean?\n\nNow, the entrees came and they were good.  I had a steak and my friend had the Chicken Kiev.  Quite tasty.  But then I was surprised that the waiter didn't come back to check on us.  The manager did, which was nice.  The waiter came by when we were done.  \n\nKudos to the restaurant for a good appetizer and entrees, but shame on them for such horrible service.  Will I go back?  Hmmm...maybe after a while.  I'll give them some time to fix their service, because this used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas (I previously gave them 5 stars) and it would be a pity never to go back.  But for now I'm still shocked at the horrible service."

We asked our waiter to suggest a Belvedere-esq vodka (you know, trying to branch out and all!) and both of our drinks (2 diff vodkas by the way) were AWEFUL!! Now, mind you it could've been the bartender's heavy hand with the vermouth or perhaps really crap vodka...who knows.  Anyway, we sent them back and got something ab it more tried and true and it was FABULOUS!  So good thing is they don't mind swapping one drink for another if you're unhappy!\n\nThere's a cool bar made of ice so that you can set your martini shaker and glass on it and keep them chilly cool...pretty nifty!  Also, as someone mentioned in their review, there's a walk-in fridge that houses a ton of vodka and if you pay thru the nose, you can enter and partake of your vodka inside.  The cool thing is that they fork over sweet furs for you to wear in the fridge AND you get to drink along side the head of Stalin (I believe that's who it is!) which sits inside the walk-in!  His GIANT body graces the front entrance to the bar so only those brave (and with deep pockets) get to see his noggin'!!"

Last night before the Lionel Richie concert was the perfect time.\n\nMy server was Mary and she saw to it that I got my iced tea quickly and she gave me plenty of time to look over the menu and then answer some questions.  For an appetizer, I got the Siberian nachos.  This is a fun way of doing nachos in a different manner.  There are five, very thinly sliced,waffle potato chips each with a nice slice of very good smoked salmon.  Topping each is a small dollop of caviar and sour cream.  The potato slices are so delicate, you can't pick up the chip and eat it with the salmon on top.\n\nThe main course had to be beef stroganoff.  This was made differently than I've ever had before but it was no less good.  In fact, this was the star of the meal and I recommend anyone eating here try the stroganoff.  It's a braised short rib that was extremely tender accompanied by wild mushroom tagliatelle.  There is some truffle flavored ricotta placed between the pasta and the beef.  Unlike what we normally think of stroganoff, this one was not heavy on sour cream to make a gravy for the beef.  Rather, the ricotta simply becomes blended a bit with the very good juices from the meat.  I like their way of doing stroganoff.\n\nI took Mary's advice for dessert--it's actually what I was going to order anyway.  This was good but was a bit of a disappointment.  The strawberry baked Alaska wasn't made nor served like a traditional baked Alaska which could have been OK except for one thing.  The base was a thin sponge cake with some fresh strawberry slices.  This was topped with some strawberry ice cream, and then the whole thing was mounded--not with meringue--but with marshmallow fluff that had been browned.  When I put my spoon to what I thought was meringue I learned by the very thick consistency how wrong I was.  The marshmallow was overwhelming in texture and in sweetness!  I was glad to get below to the strawberry ice cream to offset some of the cloying sweetness.\n\nService during dinner was excellent and Mary was a very pleasant server who made the dinner pleasant.  The runners made sure my iced tea was refilled as soon as I finished my glass.\n\nI like the room with it's Soviet themes.  This starts with the beheaded statue of Vladimir I. Lenin at the entrance.  The head was cut off and is in a freezer in the vodka tasting lounge where you get bottle service.  Above the door inside is CCCP for the Soviet Union and there's a hammer and sickle vodka vault sign by the bar and I could see part of the one mural in the bar/lounge area about a delegate--that's all I could read of the Russian letters.  While passing time between courses, I did notice that on the wall above the side of the bar, they have misspelled the Russian word for Square in their Red Square.  Perhaps it's the teacher in me and maybe it was my tough Russian professor in undergraduate school. \n\nFinally, the restaurant is very vibrant--sound wise.  I wouldn't plan on having a quiet conversation with your table mate."

First the good:\n\nI ordered the KGB cocktail (Ketel One Vodka, Fresh Cucumber & Watermelon, Chili) and it was delicious and refreshing. I'll admit this was one of the better cocktails I've had in a while, as all the components worked perfectly together.\n\n(I'll also note that the happy hour price is $11, which seems steep but is a veritable bargain compared to the normal $18 price tag.)\n\nNow the bad: We wanted to get a snack, so we went with the Oysters on the Half Shell (Tobiko Caviar, Soy Mignonette, 3 Per Order). First of all, I have to note that the \"3 Per Order\" warning was *not* on the menu and I certainly wouldn't have gotten it if I'd known there were only three. It meant I only got to eat one, since I offered to let my dining companion eat the third one.

I'll admit this was the place I was looking forward to going to the most. Now I know the biggest complaint is this is not real Russian food and that's true. They will tell you this when you sit down. This is Russian influenced food only. Keep this in mind if you try this place. Second, There are two things to go for one being the Vodka flights and Vodka locker and the other is the ice bar. We had a reservation for 7 PM on Christmas eve and we were seated right away. The atmosphere was amazing here. The attention to detail was what made this restaurant stand out from others. The service was spot on. The waiter went through every page of there huge menu and was VERY knowledgeable. He gave some suggestions and he was dead on. One thing to note this is not a cheap meal and if your strapped for cash not the best place to go. Maybe for a special drink but not to eat. There meals floated around the $32.00+ per range. My friend got the Kulebyaka (Salmon) it was pretty good. I got the Chicken Kiev and it was incredible. It just melted in your mouth and was just perfect. Also, got a the USSR Vodka flight and this was a real treat. The vodka flight is a must have if you like vodka. There are 4 shots and plenty for 2 people to share. The total for the 2 meals, vodka flight, and a salad (Czar) came to $122.84 before tip. Very much worth it in my opinion. I would most certainly return in the future. I will not make this a yearly visit for food but will go to the ice bar for drinks on every trip. After I had paid the bill we wanted to go to the Ice bar for a few martinis. I've never had one nor really like them but the bartender was very cool and willing to make anything you want with no questions. Willing to make them stronger if they were not without charging for each shot and the bar area was really a cool place to have a drinks. From what people say go for a bloody Mary and you will be in for a surprise if you like them. I loved this place and would recommend it to anyone."

The beef slider on the menu was $7 for A slider...yes, you are reading that correct...1 Slider...not really a shareable item, now is it?\n\nThe Steak Tartar, the salmon pizza, and the buffalo wings were good.  The Moscow Mules we all had were quite enjoyable as well.  Certain cocktails off the bar menu were discounted from $18 to $11.\n\nWhen looking at the dinner menu, just felt as if there was nothing really exciting about the dishes offered so as a group, we just ordered more appetizers and paid the full price for the full size portions which seemed of more value.\n\nI will compliment the gentleman who was the food runner/busser as he kept our water filled and plates cleared, doing it with a friendly attitude and a smile.\n\nOverall, I am not sure I would rush back to Red Square...I think the service (despite the food runner) just put my friends and I \"off\" and made the experience less enjoyable than it could have been.  I'm not sure if Lenin would be proud..."

Try one of their flights to experience a broad new prospective on the clear-colored liquid. \n\nA huge statue of Lenin dominates the doorway, as well as the USSR hammer and sickle on the tiled floor. The interior can best be described as dark, with lots of red and lots of ice. In fact, part of the bar is a frozen block of ice lit underneath in red. Great for keeping the drinks cold long after they've been poured. \n\nGoing along with the themed decor, the food selection includes several types of caviar, along with blini, Chicken Kiev, and Stroganoff. \n\nAtmosphere is laid back and casual. Everyone is dressed from jeans to dresses depending on where they're coming from or planning to go to after. I wouldn't call this a destination to go out of ones way for, but as a definite worthwhile go-between on the way to somewhere else."

The dinner was comped so we decided to chow down anyways.\n\nThey first brought out spicy wings, cezar (caesar) salad,  and kobe beef sliders. I would go back solely for the sliders! I had the Hibiscus Bomb which was like a pomegranate flavored Red Bull & vodka. We thought we were done but they bombarded us with another round of food. This time it was the prawns and flat iron steak. I wish I had been more hungry because that steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and was soo good.\n\nI definitely want to go back and try many of the things on their menu comped or not.

My dish was exactly what I expected it to be just the right portion not too small not to big just perfect. the meat was cooked to perfection and the sauce was a great compliment to the dish. The Filet Oscar however blew my mind. Im not sure if they serve prime steaks but it doesn't matter this dish was an orchestra or wonderful textures and flavors in your mouth. The sauce had a hint horseradish and wow I would eat it again and again and again.\n\nThis place has a romantic feel as well. With the red hints of lighting and decor and dimly lit.

Name it and I've tried and loved it! Standouts for us have always been the osetra caviar, steak tartare, borscht, lobster bisque, czar salad, brilliant stroganoff, yummy lobster fettuccine, lamb, and chicken kiev!\n\nSo this past weekend we took some VIP's out to dinner at Red Square and, while the food and service still rocked, other things didn't-\n\n#1 We reserved our usual large booth in the back for our party both online and when I called to confirm the reservation. Upon arrival, the young female seater tried to give us the small wooden table at the front door, ugh! The manger came, smoothed things over, and we waited an additional 15 minutes at the bar for a smaller booth located on the side of the restaurant. \n\n#2 The bill arrived. I paid, giving a generous gratuity, like we usually do, sign the charge, smile and chat up the manager on the way out, and begin taking some photos with the VIP's outside the restaurant. \n\nSuddenly there's a hand on my shoulder and it's the assistant manger, \"Umm, we ran your card again and it's declined.\" \nWTH?!\nFirst of all, get your hand off my Gucci sportcoat, secondly, why would it decline when it was already approved???\nOver it!!! \nWe pay in cash, and leave for the Mandalay Bay casino. \n\nFive minutes later my phone rings in the casino and it's the fraud prevention representative from my bank who informs me that someone at Red Square is still trying to run charges in varying amounts using my credit card!!!! \n\nWe go back to the restaurant to see what gives and speak to the manger who assures us that they don't retain the records of the credit card numbers used for their restaurant patrons. Bullshit...the bill was settled (still with our usual generous tip I might add) so why in the world is someone at Red Square restaurant Mandalay Bay trying to use my credit card as we speak? Huh??? \n\nWill we go back? Meh, get it together first Red Square!!!"

(I think this is available on weekdays from 11pm to 2am). I tried a few things on the drink menu including the \"Jewel of Russia,\" a delicious refreshing fruit infused vodka. Fantastic! I'm thinking of trying to find this online so I can buy some for happy hour at home.\n\nOur second trip to Red Square was for Cavi Hour. Every day from 4-6 you can go buy two Imperia vodka drinks and with this you receive 1 oz of Petrossian caviar including the full spread of toast points, hard boiled eggs, chopped red onions, and creme fraiche. A beautiful delicious spread, and the best caviar I've ever had. (Granted I haven't had a whole lot, but I've had some and this was amazing).\n\nLoved it!"

As the commercial says, \"opulence, I has it!\"  This place was incredible.  As you walk up to Red Square you are greeted by the beheaded statue of Vladimir Lenin.  The mood is set and this is not the Cold War's Russia...but a venture forward into the modern excess that has swept the country for those who weren't devastated by the economic transition to capitalism.\n\nAs I was in Vegas with a group of guys, we started the evening off the only way we could, but drinking with Vladimir himself.  For a costly $300, we bought a bottle of Kettle One and the right to don fur coats in the decked out sub-zero bar (the Vodka Vault)  where Lenin's frozen head encased in glass provides the bar for your sub-zero Vodka.  It's worth saying, this pricey endeavor wasn't bad when you figure 8 of us had about 3 - 4 shots each, and there was vodka left.  You're paying at least that much if you're at the bar, and no fur coats, over-sized throne to sit at, and certainly, no Lenin's head!  The choice was clear for us as to the variety of Vodka, but if you wanted another, the room is stocked!  Some restaurants have lengthy wine lists; this is Russia, and though wine is on the menu, Vodka is the focus!\n\nFor my meal, I indulged in the tasting menu.  Whenever i go to a new restaurant, I like to get the lay of the land.  In this case, it was perfect as the portions were ample, but not overfilling, and the selection was wonderful!  The meal began with Amuse Bouche, literally meaning a small bite before the meal, paired with champagne.  The decadent hors d'\u0153uvre was lovely toasted bruchetta with a  light seared tuna, a delicious savory drizzle topped with delicate caviar.  I had arrived. \n\nThe second round was my choice of three appetizers, of which I chose the peppered calamari.  As an Italian boy who grew up with calamari, I wasn't sure how the Ruskies would do, and wasn't let down.  When they say peppered, they aren't kidding and it was wonderful.  Perfectly breaded, deliciously tender and wonderfully spicy, this was a great way to make sure my taste buds were still working after my vodka starter!\n\nMy third course was a delicious house salad.  It was nothing special, but it wasn't a garden salad either.  Delicious arugula kept with the peppered theme of the appetizer and though, I'm quite certain it wasn't a Russian themed portion of the meal, it was appreciated.  The salad was followed by a pallet cleansing Intermezzo, a term I knew from music as an 'in-between' that brings two parts together, but have never so elegantly had tied into a meal.  This delicious treat which was a small cordial flute filled with a dollup of vanilla ice cream in a lovely champagne was a perfect way to ready myself for the main course, my steak. \n\nWhen I stay steak, I don't want to confuse you...as this wasn't dad's steak either.  Instead, it was the deliciously sinful Roquefort Crusted Filet Mignon.  To say this was incredible was an understatement.  When going for the gusto on a large meal, fillet is always my first choice.  it's delicious, it's often something the chef's can cook to order well, and it's not over-sized.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Cooked to a wonderfully warm medium rare, the fillet encrusted with a delicious cheese and atop of amazingly garlicy pureed potatoes...it was fantastic.  It's worth noting that there are two flavors I love above all others...the creamy tangyness of cheeses and the wonderful comfort of garlic, and this had both!  Not to mention, the steak was cooked perfectly.  It was a delicious salty crust on the outside that gave way to velvety red of a perfectly medium rare steak, all topped with a red wine sauce, and it was wonderful!\n\nAt this point, you could've suck a fork in me, as I was done, but they weren't!  The final course of this journey in opulence was the dessert, a caramel-vanilla bean creme brulee that was phenomenal!  I love creme brulee and often find it either not crispy enough on top or too watery on the bottom, this was perfect in both regards.  \n\nIn the end, this gets my five stars because the food was amazing (as was the food of the other 7 guys who were there), the service was excellent, the ambiance transported you a continent away to world's largest country, and the experience from top to bottom was one to be savored.  This was a great idea, and I owe my friend Jay for making this happen, as it was well worth the wait and cost.  And, while I'm on that, my tasting menu, incredibly reasonable at $65...yeah, that's it.  Get there people, get ready for a great meal, and enjoy!"

I woke up today (okay, this afternoon, its Vegas) and immediately thought of the sliders.  It is surprisingly filing and full of flavor.  A definite for any slider fan.\n\nLast but not least we went on the bartenders choice for drinks and I tried my first Moscow Mule.  Lets just say that once I tried it, I stayed with it all night it was so refreshing, not sweet or bitter, and went down easy.  I will be making these at home from now on.\n\nThe red square was the best as always."

It is pretty dark inside and had to use our iPhones to read the menu (and we 37 and 41).\n\nThe bar features ever type of Russian vodka you could ever hope to try and have a vodka room that is freezing cold where drinks are surfed on top of Stalin's head.  I had the Moscow Mule and it was incredible!\n\nThe menu is very simple with only a few items in each section to pick from.  Because the menu doesn't offer \"everything\" they really core down and focus on the flavor of their offerings.  I had the Beef Stroganoff: noodles were perfectly done and the beef literally fell apart using my fork with exquisite flavor.  My partner had the Chicken Kiev which had Lays chip crust and it was to die for.\n\nOur waitress was prompt and knowledgeable about the drink and food offerings.  Overall, we were not expecting a restaurant like this in a Vegas resort......GREAT JOB!!!!!"

My ahi tuna entree was tasty but rather ordinary - it did not make me say anything close to \"wow, this is amazing!\". \n\nI do have to say that service was very responsive - one of my friends had her steak overcooked and they immediately took it back and shortly came out with another that was cooked as ordered. \n\nSome other menu items that were interesting but we did not order were: a selection of different caviars and a monster lobster and fruit platter which I saw another table have.\n\nBottom line: hip, cool place for drinks (as long as they put enough vodka into them). Decent food but pricey - as long as your company is paying for it or you have a high roller buying you dinner, then you'll be fine."

It was a welcome departure from the steak and chicken driven menus in other venues.\n\nWe started with Siberian nachos consisting of wonton chips topped with caviar, wasabi, smoked salmon, and creme fraiche.   The interplay of flavors in this appetizer was enhanced two fold when we paired it with the restaurant's version of a Bloody Mary.  The drink was awesome- it was spicy, accented by a green olive stuffed with blue cheese poured over the smoothest vodka I've ever had.  Ever!\n\nFor dinner I had the Salmon Kubeyalka (sic) which consisted of a buerre blanc sauce beneath a puff pastry topped with mushroom risotto.  On top of the risotto was the flakiest and most tender piece of Salmon resting beneath another layer of puff pastry which was adorned with a hard boiled egg white filled with caviar.  \n\nOur waiter was very accommodating, very attentive to the details, and extremely knowledgeable about every aspect of our dining experience.  The other entrees ordered by my friends were also well received judging by the restraint exercised by those wanting to lick their plates clean.  Next time you go to Vegas, add this spot to your itinerary."

As I recall a strong vodka based martini at happy hour was around $10. My favorite was the Chernobyl. Now you have to order off an iPad menu that makes no sense (yes, I know how to use one as I'm writing this review on one). The specials were $6 wells or $8 glasses of wine. Hardly \"Russian\". Service was incredibly slow. The best help was from the bar back who would probably make a great bartender had he been an airhead with some surgical augmentation. They bartenders were great to look at but did not earn more than a minute tip from me (just enough to let them know I hadn't forgotten them). Needless to say, my wife and I left $60 poorer and still did not have a buzz."

I remember having the tartare amd caesar salad, which were both very good.\n\nThis past time we went just to get into the vodka vault. Having seens it last time, i wanted to check it out. You need to order a bottle to get in, but you get your own server and garnishes and fur coats(and a fur hat if you want) to wear.\n\nWe did it just to say we did something a bit different than ordering a round in a bar. And since we are all very much into vodka, we wanted to try some different kinds. I forgot which bottle we ordered, but it was gone in about 4 minutes. There was 6 of us in there, not including our hostess. Then we proceeded to order 5-6 more rounds. Bad move. While i enjoyed tasting so many differnt vodkas, and being able to compare them all at the same time while in a sub zero freezer, the amount that we drank caused my cousin to lose the ability to walk or stay upright about 15 seconds after leaving the vault. And since we did not stay at mandalay, it was an adventure carrying her back to NY NY. It was pricey too, ~$950 for about 30 minutes in the vault. But it's Vegas, you need to splurge sometimes."

It was hands down one of the best and most unique dining experiences of my entire life.  \n\nI love the dim red lighting.  The chandeliers are gorgeous.  The booths, walls, and all around decor perfectly create the spectacular ambience.\n\nI ordered the stroganoff and it was delicious.\n\nIn order to get the true Red Square experience, you must purchase a bottle of vodka which earns you automatic entry into the Vodka Vault.  I think the cheapest bottle is $150, but it's well worth it.  You get a Vodka Goddess who assists you with picking your bottle and escorting you into the vault, plus you get free unlimited mixers with it.  There were 4 of us so we all had plenty of vodka tonics (or martinis or whatever you prefer) with dinner, then saved 2 shots of vodka each for when we went in the Vodka Vault.  \n\nThe Vodka Vault is a below zero freezer where they keep an array of these fine bottles of clear liquor.  Once you're ready to enter the vault, your Goddess will help you slip into your mink coat, and optional mink hat, and escort you inside.  Outside of the restaurant is the statue of Lenin's body, minus the head.  Inside the vault, Lenin's head awaits you where you are encouraged to take your vodka shot(s) off of.  It was really, really fun. \n\nI highly reccommend this one of a kind restaurant and definitely plan on returning here many more times throughout my life."

So if you set a drink on it it'll frost up and stay cold.  They have quite an extensive original martini list, most of them fruity.

The atmosphere is dark but inviting. We took a seat at a table when you first walk in and were almost instantly greeted by our waitress. She was polite and explained how to order, as they use ipads for their menus. My group ordered vodka on the rocks, a chocolate shot, Apple Cider, and something else that I can't remember. Anyhoo, it was all fabulous! The bar tenders hand chipped an ice round that fit into the glass they used for the vodka rocks, it was very impressive how perfectly it fit. The chocolate shot was divine and tasted like chocolate milk. I am still dreaming about the Apple Cider, which was a martini, it was so good. I will certainly make a repeat trip next time I am in Vegas!"

They have a narrow menu, with a nice selection of caviar, from the reasonable to the extravagant. There is an extensive menu of vodka drinks. They also offer flights of vodka. The foods I tried were at happy hour (4-7 daily) and were therefore less than full price (woo hoo for me). The Siberian nachos featured a freshly made crispy and thin cross-cut potato chip topped with buttery soft smoked salmon. There was a dollop of sour cream and some fine black caviar on top.  The portion would have been fine to share, and with the fries it made more than an adequate dinner for little ole me. The atmosphere at the bar is dark and a bit noisy. They have two tvs tuned to different sports channels. (Phew-one was on the cricket!). The bar staff was attentive and friendly. They quickly served me. I would be interested in eating their dinner food, based on the quality of the snacks."

They used to have great shirts and caps that read \"Red Square - Join the party.\" Now the waitresses are dressed in more Vegas-y seductive military-esque uniforms, which fit the theme better, I suppose. \n\nThe drinks are always amazing. We've tried the White Ruskie (a twist on the white Russian), the Root of Sin, and the KGB, and all three were very tasty and strong enough. My girlfriend looks forward to the KGB especially, every time we plan a trip.\n\nThe last two visits have been since they changed the menu and shirts, so the review will be on those. \n\n\nVisit 2 - 4/5 stars. 6-18-2015 \n\nThe one dock of a star is because they overcharged us and then wouldn't answer their phone when we called to resolve it. If someone messages me saying they will toss the tip to the waitress, I'd be more happy.\n\nWe both asked for recommendations from our waitress, and ended up ordering the steak and the prawns as our dishes, with some sliders for appetizer. The sliders were very small, but tasty. Nothing special. \n\nDrinks were amazing.\n\nMy steak was very juicy, and well-portioned. They said it came with one side-dish, but ended up charging us for it ($9). We noticed it, and called to tell them to give it as a tip to our waitress, because she was pretty good. Instead it went to the restaurant for a sneaky charge. Lame!\n\nThe steak came with two sauces. The first was a sharp, tangy red wine sauce that really electrified, tangy, the tongue at first taste. The second was a green peppercorn sauce, which was creamy and sweet, with a bit of an earthy undertone.\n\nI asked for mashed potatoes as a side dish and they were amazing. It came with a bit of smoked sea salt, and the texture was heavenly. It was creamy, with hearty chunks stirred in, and the flavor was rich and smoky. Very unique, and perfectly complimented the steak. One waiter stopped by and hinted that it went well with the green sauce, and indeed it did!\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the prawns, per recommendation, and she was 100% satisfied. I don't do seafood, but she wouldn't stop talking about it all day. The side it came with was delicious, and she kept stealing my red wine sauce and forcing me to try it with different parts of her dish.\n\nFor a dessert, we did a bread pudding with caramel sauce. Bread pudding is either amazing or boring, and there's not much in-between. By this point, the drinks had me a little biased, but I believe it was on the amazing end of the spectrum.\n\nVisit 1 - 3/5 stars. About 2 yrs ago.\n\nThe drinks were great. I ordered the only chicken item on the menu (lays chicken) and my girlfriend ordered a lobster dish. My entree was surprisingly tasty. Would probably have been a decent portion if I didn't have to split it with my girlfriend when she got jipped on her portion.\n\n\nThe lobster dish, however, was pretty plain, and although it was presented beautifully, the portion size was actually very deceptive. They put a large shell on the plate, which made the food look raised, and better portioned than it really was. For the $35 or whatever it was, it was essentially appetizer-sized, and didn't even taste good enough to be memorable.\n\nOverall, it was good, but we both could have used a little bit more food."

Other friend had the Ribeye with mashies...sort of the plainest meal on the menu, and her beef had a bit too much fat on it.  \n\nCan you believe that we had only one martini between us?  It didn't taste all that great...kindof a strange mix of flavors.  Oh well.

The sauce is not anything close to what one would expect for stroganoff. There was no hint of the sour cream flavor that is commonly used in stroganoff. The menu listed creme fraiche as being used. But, the sauce was so dark, that if creme fraiche was used it had to be a very small amount. The taste, color, and consistency of the sauce was more similar to beef stew. I did not like the Strozapretti noodles at all. \nThe chef chose to use Strozapretti noodles instead of egg noodles. I am fine with making changes to improve things but  these noodles were thick, mushy and did not go well in this dish (think of big thick noodles inside your beef stew). I definitely would not order this dish again. I give the place a star for the ambience/bar and another star for service."

DO NOT GO to Red Square!\n\nt began with a friend of who won several $1K's of dollars playing poker and staying in a suite at Mandalay to convince me (a local) to come visit him for a drink at Red Square.   Our bartender, Rebecca was delightful enough to oblige our request for a few special cocktails. \n\nThen the barback, Jason, obliged our request to have multiple shots, after inviting a few other guests into the Vodka \"Freezer\" Chamber for a few shotsl  \n\nUpon returning to our seats, after 10 shots total and 3 rounds plus appetizers at our table, we were having a great time.  Coupled with the NBA playoffs, (and some high bets on the game) we decided for on more round of drinks, which Rebecca served.  During the \"mixing period\" of our drinks, the bar has some bottles of Vodka 'frozen' into the bar which my friend and I promptly released as a jest to the challenge that it couldn't be removed.  Once removed, we were playing a funny game of hide and seek.  \n\nCoincidentally, our bill came!  We promptly paid it after returning all the \"preset alcohol bottles\" back (per Jason's request).   After our credit card and bill (for $300+) was approved, the security PROMPTLY came and asked us to leave.  We hadn't done anything wrong aside from removing the bottle from the \"frozen bar\" but we replaced it before we left!!!\n\nNothing more embarrassed my friend and I in front of our out of town guest than the unresponsive (ignorant) security asking us to leave.  They had no clue of the situation they were responsible for removing until we requested to know why we were being asked to leave. The ignorant security responded that the manager saw us taking the bottle from the bar, and wanted us to leave.  Although we had returned the bottle (and conveniently had just paid our tab) they continued on and did NOT give us explanation as to our request for departure.  The manager walked away and the \"security\" did nothing intelligent nor poignant  to express our reason for being dismissed. \n\nWe left without refute but still completely unsure of the purpose.   Fortunately we had paid our tab, yet on our way out, we were completely confused and dissatisfied with the way we were treated upon our last 30 minutes there after spending over $300 and a few hours having great conversation and drinks with the bartender (Re)becca) and barback Jason.  \n\nUnfortunately for this establishment as well as Mandalay Bay, neither me, nor my colleagues will EVER suggest or recommend this hotel or bar to any other colleagues, associates or business prospects EVER in the future."

Ok, I've eaten at Petrossian's in Manhattan several times and I know that an ounce of osetra there will set you back about $45 (they sell it by the gram, so I did a little conversion for ya!).  And that's if you buy it \"to go\" and of course, it's much more expensive - almost double - if you get the whole set up...and that's what you get at Red Square.  Caviar served on a bed of ice, mother of pearl spoon, blinis, creme fraiche, chopped egg, etc...the whole bit.\n\nSit at the cool (get it?) ice bar - be prepared to wait for a seat - and enjoy the great bartenders and an ~$100 extravagance for only thirty bucks.  Heckuva way to start the evening!\n\n-----\n\nUpdate -  Thx to Kurt S. in LA who (gently) corrected me that the caviar is American Sturgeon and not Osetra...hey, at least I calculated the price/value within a buck :D!"

They also were offering a complimentary shot of Stolis.  Service was friendly enough. I really enjoyed the atmosphere.  I was disappointed that they only offered one potato vodka . They could also use more than one bartender behind the bar.  It got really busy which translated into long waits. I wanted to order more food and vodka but got tired of trying to get the bartender's attention and we just decided it was time to leave. If you're in Vegas I would recommend a visit to try a vodka you've never had before."

I enjoy making Russian classics from time to time, but, Red Square toasts Russian culinary while still acknowledging Las Vegas style.\n\nAny Russian loves a good vodka martini.  The ice bar solidifies that your vodka will remain cold while you admire that there actually is an indoor ice block inside of a restaurant in one of the hottest cities in the world.  \n\nThe food is the upscale version of country Russian fare.  You will find no gristle on the filet mignon here, nor will you find dried fish on the menu, but this is as classic Russian grub as one can find in Nevada.\n\nBesides, the atmosphere is of pure Russian opulence, you won't be disappointed."

My friends had the salmon, lobster bisque and pseudo ceasar salad, and a filet mignon oscar special. It was all good. The filet was perfectly cooked, and the salad looked divine. We had the dessert vodka flight, and most of them were so good you could hardly tell it was vodka. The chocolate tasted like coffee, but I like coffee so I didn't mind. Pineapple was my favorite. \nI only wish I'd tried the stroganoff, some people next to us had it, and it smelled phenomenal. \n\nThe service was kind of lame, she didn't pay enough attention to us, and spilled some of my deelish lychee martini, and didn't make enough of a fuss about it. \n\n I would definitely come back here, and get the hazelnut crusted lamb chops, a recipe idea I intend to steal and make at home for sure. \n\nThe odd thing I thought about Vegas in general is that you always have to go to a bathroom outside of where ever you're at - it's either in the lobby or the casino. It was the lobby in this case."

Dinner consisted of buffalo wings, caesar salad, prawns and risotto, sliders, and some kind of steak plus one specialty cocktail. \nEVERYTHING was DELICIOUS!! Especially the riostto and steak! NOM NOM NOM!  \nI think our server was Erika?? She was super nice and dinner was SO great! Most importantly the girls LOVED it and that's what matters here! \n\nJust an FYI they do give you a bill at the end with an automatic gratuity on it."

When I first walked into this gothic style restaurant, I was immediately excited. I really enjoy dining in different settings, especially if it makes it seem like you're in a different place. I felt as though I had left the country and stepped into a restaurant in Moscow. \n\nThe service was excellent. Everyone was friendly, but not over the top too nice there were minimal interruptions. \n\nVery romantic and dark. There was just something about it, I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe because it was the whole experience. Just fantastic. If I have a chance to come back I most certainly will."

We got dumpling appetizer and the bottom of the dumplings were burned. Was disappointed a chief would let those be served like that. We overlooked it. Our salad and meals were delicious. We ended our meal with coffee to pump us up for gambling. Coffee was served by waiter in a beautiful silver coffee pot, but it was cold. The burnt dumplings and cold coffee was strange for a higher end restaurant, but would still recommend it the place."

Where do you go with a week's notice and 11 of your closest friends?  Red Square was able to seat us with a 9 p.m. reservation which was not too shabby considering that we weren't planning weeks in advance.  \n\nThe table we had was great - a little tucked away in the corner which was a good place to sit since we actually wnated to hear each other and catch up.  The area we had was roomy, and the table was nicely set.\n\nThere were lots of great items on the menu, and the server pushed the rocquefort cheese filet mignon which I gladly ordered.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share - fried calamari, tuna tartare, crab cake and the Siberian nachos.  I had an opportunity to taste all but the Siberian nachos because those went quickly...which makes me think they were very good.  My favorite was the tuna tartare which was delicious, but I'm a sucker for tuna tartare (and apparently for filet mignon).  Everybody was delighted with their meals - I think we all ordered beef!\n\nThe server told us that Red Square is the largest vodka distributor in North America which is pretty darn impressive (if that's true); they had all sorts of flavored vodkas.  I tried to cocktails - the pomegrenate martini and the eqiuvalent of a mojito...but made with vodka.  Both were great!\n\nThere is a cute little freezer/icebox room at the front of the restaurant where you can drink vodka in a freezer.  I'm not sure what the novelty is besides the fact that you're drinking in a freezer...and wearing dead animals (Red Square will provide mink coats and hats for the party).  It seemed kind of interesting but I was not about to hop into a 5 degree room to drink vodka.  But, I think it was something around $200 for a bottle of vodka for you and your friends to taste...\n\nFunniest moment of the night (or at least up until that point in the night), a couple of girls walked up to our table and asked to join us mid-meal because they thought the table could use a few girls.  Granted, it was a party of 9 guys and 3 girls, but the girls at the table were a little insulted (I didn't care too much...but then again, they weren't trying to pick up on my husband).  Anyway, props to the girls for their bold and aggressive behavior...but man, that is ROUGH.  You are really putting yourself out there to join a dinner part of friends mid-meal...  I wonder if they really thought we would say yes...?"

Maybe because the entrance looks like the entrance into a cold frigid fortress, or maybe the idea of a Russian restaurant inspired thoughts of strange food ending in \"kiev\" that I wouldn't like.  All of this was completely illogical, of course, as was proven to me one night during a girls night out.\n\nWe had dinner here before going into Light, the club next door.  The service was great, as we were seated right away and our drink orders were taken.  The inside of the restaurant is dark and sexy, barely lit by the many candles set on each table.  Our dinner was served family style and consisted of buffalo wings, caesar salad, prawns and risotto, sliders, and steak.  I also ordered a Moscow mule.  I was pretty impressed by all of the food.  My favorite by far was the prawns and risotto.  The prawns were huge and delicious, and the risotto was perfectly cooked and seasoned just right. Even though I didn't want to be all full and bloated in my clubbing outfit, I couldn't stop eating!\n\nThis would really be a great place for a date night and I can't wait to go back and try more things off the menu.  The only thing I will say is that everything is pretty expensive.  Cocktails over $18 and not one appetizer under $14.  While I think the food is spectacular, the portions are small and it is not quite such fine dining that should justify those types of prices."

I already liked Russian food and I was impressed by the kitchen's attention to detail.\n\nA night or two later, we came back with the entire wedding party. We wanted to toast the bride and groom with the whole vodka bottle service in the freezer shabang. Little did we know that the staff at Red Square were going to want to close a full two hours early. No kidding, I was shocked. The hostess who was so friendly only a couple days before delivered our mixed drinks and hovered at the bar until the millisecond she could collect our check. She even closed the front door and turn away new groups that wanted to come in.\n\nDefinitely consider coming here for dinner, but no later than 8pm TOPS."

Between this and the yummy pretzel rolls, we were getting full before our main courses.  I ordered two lobster tails with asparagus and wild mushroom risotto.  Wow!  It was *almost* too much lobster to finish.  The risotto was too heavy and meh, so I didn't eat it; just picked out the mushrooms.  DH had some sort of steak and enjoyed it.  We shared their \"candy bar\" dessert, it was incredible - tasted like a frozen snickers bar with strawberries.  A delicious, decadent dinner, for sure!

The missing head of the statue out front is encased in this plastic cube made to look like ice.  This is basically your table.   There was one ornate chair in the room and the room itself was tiny.   That's basically all that's in there.

The first time was for dinner and moderate drinks:  The food at Red Square is fairly average.  If you are looking for food indicative of the people and their culture, you have come to the wrong place.  The Siberian Nachos (smoked salmon, wasabi cream, and chives on top of a wanton chip--surely a traditional staple of the Gulag) were surprisingly good.  My entree of Strozapretti Stroganoff, however, was far from anything special and, to top it off, came to the table seeming like it had been sitting around for a while.  Orders of caviar come with a full array of traditional condiments--blini and toast points, creme fraiche, crumbled egg whites and egg yolks from a hard boiled egg, chives, and onions.\n\nWe returned to Red Square to fully indulge in the restaurant's vodka menu--which is extensive.  We took a pass on paying \"bottle service\" prices to visit the private vodka vault and instead ordered shot after shot after shot after...you get the picture.  Red Square is definitely the place to go if you're looking to try a lot of different vodkas.  2 oz. shots were in the $11 to $30 range (for the high end vodkas).  I'd suggest doing one of the higher end samplers if you're looking to try the pricey stuff.\n\nService was friendly, and the decor, while Vegas cheesy (featuring a big Communist mural on the wall and a headless statue of Lenin in front of the restaurant) was fun."

A friend works for the restaurant group responsible and made a reservation for us to dine here. \n\nFirst of all, the decor is absolutely perfect, with dim red lighting, pictures on the walls, a bar to the right with shelves upon shelves of vodka. Was a great atmosphere for a dinner celebration. All sorts of people dining or having drinks, old to young, groups of all woman, groups of men, couples, you name it! \n\nThe minute we sat down our server came to speak with us, made a couple of jokes and told us not to be shy about being loud and enjoying ourselves. He was the friendliest most helpful waiter I have ever encountered and we felt very comfortable.\n\nHe explained the drink menu and made recommendations. We pretty much stuck to the drink recommendations he made and were not disappointed. Drinks were fabulous! Make sure and at least try one. The drink menu is beyond anything I've ever seen, many different kinds of vodkas, martinis, and cocktails. They also explained they can pretty much make any drink you want with any one of their vodkas on hand-- just take your pick! \n\nWe had these dumplings as an appetizer that our waiter recommended. He said it was on the bar menu but that we could order it if interested. It came in a very rich broth, and once we ate all of the dumplings we asked for more bread so that we could soak up the rest of the broth. Delicious!\n\nI ordered the dinner special of the day which was a steak with crab on top and Bearnaise sauce. It also came with truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus. Now, I like my meat mooing-- you heard me, mooing. My piece was made exactly the way I like it- juicy and rare. The mashed potatoes were also delicious and the asparagus- I actually ate all of it! I am not the biggest vegetable fan, and I actually liked it, so that says a lot! \n\nI also tried some of the other dishes my friends ordered, including the lobster fettucine-- hearty and tasty, and the strogonoff-- again, really hearty but flavorful!  \n\nWe got a round of Vodka shots, I am not sure which one it was, all I know is it was a flavored vodka and we were all pretty loud and rowdy after that! \n\nFor desert, my friend was kind enough to set up a \"Birthday Desert\" which I believe was an assortment of different sweets on their menu. My favorite was this faux sweet blinis. There were these crunchy chocolate balls in a sort of strawberry yogurt, and it resembled caviar. Then you assembled your own little blini with the chocolate on top- SO GOOD! Wow, absolutely delicious, I was eating it by the spoon full! The chocolate cake was also delicious, and the plate said \"Happy Birthday Nicole\" in chocolate! So cute, and so special. I was so touched! \n\nWe then had to experience the whole Vodka Vault thing, having shots off of Stalin's head in fur coats and hats. We took a whole lot of pictures in our gear, and the nice woman in charge of the vault was very patient with our over eagerness. \n\nThe service was absolutely impecable- but in a very intimate, friendly sort of way. I strongly believe that even if they food were terrible (which it wasn't) you'd still have a great time. Great for big groups, celebrations, dates, any occasion. A wonderful way to start out my Birthday weekend in Vegas."

I wanted to try some specialty martinis and try some sliders, and he wanted more of an entree. \n\nIt was not at all busy at this time. (6pm). There were two other tables occupied, and yet, we were sat in an awkward corner in the front of the restaurant, by the door. We were almost hidden! We got ice waters almost immediately from the pleasant busser, which was a relief because we did not get our actual drinks until our food came out! \n\nLike I said, the food and drinks were excellent, but we were almost neglected the rest of the experience! We finished our food and wanted a dessert and a key lime martini. Those came out pretty quickly, and again, by the busser. Our server seemed to be missing in action! (again, it was not busy!) \n\nThe server did show up to give us our check (big surprise!) and we wanted to charge it to our room to get our M Life points but she didn't leave a pen in the check presenter. And she was missing...AGAIN! We waited almost 20 minutes (no exaggeration!) for her to come back to us. Luckily, we had cash on us, because we would have waited another 20 minutes for her to swipe a credit card or to charge it to our room! \n\nIt's obvious that the server didn't think we'd tip her well, so we were not worth her time. Funny thing is, we are 20% tippers (I'm a waitress) and she really missed out! \n\nIf you do decide to dine here, don't expect great service if you're dressed in casual attire and/or look young! It's really unfortunate because the food and drinks were great and the decor was beautiful. (could have done without the 'club' type music... something softer and classier would have made it much nicer)\n\nAnyway, there are much better ways to spend your hard earned money in Las Vegas."

Yes.  Food?  No.  Douchebags and blank-eyed tourists?  Mostly.\n\nMy wife and I gave it a go while too lazy to venture out of Mandalay Bay (where we were staying), and things started off surprisingly well.  Drinks, while oddly rich in Sierra Mist and other kids-candy mixers, are fairly well executed.  Some menu-born promises, such as a chocolate-covered plantain in the \"Russkie\" (see, stupid names), are satisfied in name only.  In that case, by a dehydrated plantain chip with a smear of chocolate on it rode the foam of a banana-creme martini.\n\nOur server had zero taste, first recommending the steak tartare and then mauling it table-side by adding absolutely everything served on the plate to it.  If I wanted even parts caper, onion, beef, and horseradish sauce mashed together, I would have done it myself for less than $20.\n\nFoie gras was okay (not great, as the foie gras itself was uncharacteristically bitter), served with a berry sauce, an apple, bacon, and french toast points.  There's a reason that most French preparations stick to brown sweets, like apple, raisin, and fig.  Berries for the $24 fail.\n\nMy wife's entree, lobster fettucini, was remarkably unremarkable, with a rubbery, overcooked lobster-claw in a thin and under-salted cream sauce.  She was tired, and the not-really-rich cream sauce was all she was really looking for.  $32?  Ouch.\n\nMy entree, the Stroganoff, was absolutely offensive.  In short, it tasted like boiled anus.  The tenderloin tips were overcooked, fibrous, and bland, and they rode around in a sauce so poorly seasoned that it could absolutely never have been tasted by anyone in the kitchen.  The noodles were reasonably cooked, but covered in that terribly executed sauce, and it was all topped off with onion strings that had clearly been fried at least 30 minutes prior to being plated.  They tasted of cold, congealed fryer grease, and they were the only salt carrier of the dish.\n\nNear the end of our meal, crappy club music (and I like club music) started thumping through the entire venue.  Not a gracious end to a meal that cost nearly $150 before tip.\n\nMerely 30 feet from Wolfgang Puck's Lupo (which I've never been to, but clearly has to be better), you'd have to have suffered a debilitating brain injury or lost a bet to end up at Red Square for anything but drinks."

All were fresh, and tasty adorned with a choice of 3 sauces.  \n\nCezar Salad with fresh Romaine leaves was very tasty, followed a long time later by an unusual Beef Stroganoff derived from Short Rib, accompanied by interesting cut up pieces of Mini Baked Potatoes.  Stuffed Maine Lobster was a big hit at our table.  The majestic crustacean was filled with shrimp, crab, and herb stuffing, and a silky Butter Sauce was placed close by for easy dunking.\n\nService was very good.

After glancing over the happy hour menu, we ordered some cocktails. The bartender handed us some drinks and started to take our food order. After trying my drink, I realized that it wasn't what I ordered. Neither was my fiance's.  The bartender apologized and made us the correct drinks and let us keep the original ones if we wanted them.

I wouldn't normally order meatballs at a restaurant, but since she talked so highly of them, we decided to go with it. Her suggestion was great!

When I saw their restaurant week menu my interest was immediately piqued they were offering choices unlike anyone else. Dinner was $40.14, there were three choices of Appetizer and Entree, and two Dessert options. We started with Mini Lobster Tacos and Siberian Nachos. Entrees of Beef Stroganoff and Chicken Kiev followed, and we finished with Toffee Bread Pudding for dessert. \n\nIt was a shame the tacos were bite sized because they were mighty delicious and I was left wanting more. The delicate lobster was perfectly prepared, which too often is not the case. The nachos were intriguing, with smoked salmon piled high on potato crisps and topped with American caviar. I wish the potato slices were thicker to better support the salmon and if they were unseasoned there would still be plenty of residual saltiness from the caviar. \n\nI've grown up eating Beef Stroganoff, it's one of my favorite comfort foods. This version was more rich and better composed with braised short rib, wild mushrooms, perfect Strozzapretti and dollops of ricotta. It was tasty and a hearty portion. The chicken kiev was served with Brussels sprouts, it was unfortunate that the pan sauce was so overwhelmingly over seasoned that any other flavor beside salt was completely lost. \n\nOur waiter strongly recommended the bread pudding. I typically do not enjoy bread pudding so I was hesitant but agreed. Honestly, I'm glad I didn't have to share. Croissant pieces were piled high and served with salted caramel ice cream and toffee sauce to drizzle and it was topped off with vanilla Captain Crunch. It definitely had a breakfast taste, reminiscent of warm cinnamon rolls without being too sweet. Truly, it was a pleasant surprise. \n\nOur dinner was deeply discounted, it was a great opportunity to try Red Square. We had an enjoyable meal even if two of the dishes were over seasoned. 3.5 stars."

OK, but nothing to write home about. \nMy main entree was a filet mignon.  It was cooked very unconventionally, pot roast style.  Lots of gravy, almost a boiled beef texture.

There is caviar, potatoes, stroganoff- but that's all. I got the American caviar tasting because all the other specials were too expensive and a free well drink for checking in on Yelp. I was told that the well drinks would normally be $11.00. The standard cocktail drinks were $18.00 which would be pricey even on a Michelin starred restaurant's menu.

She made them free shots, poured additional drinks for them & then we had to call her over to place a drink order. ONLY people in the whole bar. She actually ROLLED her eyes. I could go on & on but I think you've got the gist. This place is too much of a draw for the resort to have such skanks tending bar.

I can never find that shiz in San Diego. Needless to say I sidled my sparkly shirt up to the bar and ordered myself a VG chocolate martini, up. The bartender didn't believe me at first. Oh yes sir, I just want a GIANT ice cold glass full of this liquid ecstasy.  \n\nAt some point between chocolate and espresso vodka martinis, I ate dinner. We split the Wasabi Nachos which were good and not like anything I've seen before, but not spicy at all. False advertising dudes. We split the lobster and black truffle pasta as well and that was excellent. \n\nOur server was top-notch, providing everything we could ask for, including advice, weird drink orders, separate checks and splitting our food onto two beautiful plates without being asked. \n\nThe atmosphere is dark (red, obvi) and cozy. There are very few tables, which could make the wait here ridiculous if you don't plan ahead. \nIn real life, I'd minus one star for being a bit pricey, but alas, such is Vegas."

I'm on the fence about this place, or should I say, \"on the wall.\" Ok, Russian/Commie jokes aside....\n\nHeadless Lenin out front of the Red Square has finally won me over after years of enticing me to visit each time I walked by, all thanks to their happy hour that's now daily from 4pm-7pm. My friend and I met up here on a Saturday evening for pre-concert drinking and noshing. First impression of the restaurant: it's a cross between a run down church that was converted into a communist hideout and an upscale bordello -- I can only imagine. It's on the gaudy side, but I actually dig the decor. \n\nThe place was rowdy and packed with patrons who were mainly hanging around the bar area eating and watching games on the mounted televisions. We were lucky to find seating at the corner by a window. Our server gave us the happy hour menu and a separate dessert menu upon request. \n\nDuck Fat Fries: French fries fried in duck fat topped with shredded parmesan cheese. The fries come with lemon aioli and tomato jam dipping sauces. Fries fried in duck fat sounds deliciously gluttonous, but I think the flavor -- to me -- needs to be acquired. Both dipping sauces were good. I thought the tomato jam tasted similar to cocktail sauce, but it complemented the fries as opposed to the aioli which did a better job at masking the duck fat. \n\nSummer Blueberry and Peach Pie: I was anticipating a slice of pie, but I actually received a personal size pie with a small scoop of ice cream on top. The crust was flaky and had a slight crunch and there was more blueberry than peach filling. The sweetness of the pie alone was perfect and didn't give me a sugar jolt. One downside about this dessert is the side of caramel sauce that I didn't bother using. It was in a separate pouring container, but I wasn't able to pour any caramel sauce onto my pie because it was solid....\n\nService was slow, but overall it was fine. Our only issue was tracking down our server to pay our bill because we had to head off. However, it was almost a full house on that Saturday evening. Slow service is expected.\n\nAlthough it was a busy happy hour, a return visit is likely, but it might have to happen on a weekday. \n\nRating: 3.5/5"

I think it's more like 3.5.\nMy husband and I went here last night on our first night of our mini vacay. \nI was very much looking forward to my dinner here.  The ambiance was fantastic and I've heard great things.\nWe each started off with a martini (a peach something for me and a dirty bleu cheese olive martini for him) both of which were super strong but delicious. \nWe had the salt and pepper calamari which was very good.  The batter was crispy and not too greasy and the dipping sauce was sweet with a spicy kick.  They give you a ton of calamari so we didn't finish.\nI got the chicken kiev and he got the rack of lamb.  I was extremely disappointed with my chicken :\\  The breading fell right off the chicken and was soggy.  There were a few big fatty pieces and everything was very under-seasoned.  Not even any salt at the tables to fix that.  My husbands rack of lamb, though, was impeccable.  It came with a sweet potato flan that was a thing of beauty.  The lamb was perfectly medium rare with a hazelnut dijon crust.  I might just dream about it.\n\nI heard another waiter at the table next to us announce a special of filet oscar as we were almost done with our meal.  I was very disappointed.  Filet oscar is my all time favorite and I most definitely would have ordered that had I been told it was a special.  It would have been in their best interest, as well, since I ordered the chicken which was the least expensive thing on the menu but would have ordered the oscar which was probably the most expensive thing!  We had another couple of cocktails which were good but not mind blowing and didn't have room for dessert.\nMy husband really wanted to try the vodka ice bar thing, but it was a 200 dollar minimum for a bottle and I have a hard time justifying 200 dollars (or more!) for a bottle of vodka that I could buy at bevmo for 30.  I know, I know, it's the \"experience.\""

The wait staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly and seasoned amazingly. It was great place to have an an amazing dinner and a great place to talk and enjoy each other's company. The vodka vault was very impressive! We had a really good time here! The only con I could mention was a little slow on bringing/refilling of beverages and the bill took a while to get to us. Otherwise we really enjoyed the meal!"

A great spot to visit for the happy hour and make sure to check in on help for a free drink coupon. The Moscow mule was great, super amounts of ginger and very refreshing. The Parmesan fries are very good and I think the highlight is Russian Nachos. Very delicious smoked salmon and a dab of caviar on each \"nacho\". Not sure about dinner as the prices are pretty high but if you are at Mandalay bay this is a must at happy hour. Make sure to bring your M life card to get more points as well."

We thought well, as long as we are doing it we should get a dinner reservation.  \n\nThis is located in Mandalay Bay near the wedding chapel, my friend said after he took his girlfriend there she wanted to go over to the chapel and get married so, folks, be aware of that potential hazard.\n\nWe entered in and walked through the bar to the dining area.  The dining area and bar was decorated with interesting Russian theme chandeliers and other decor.\n\nThe YS ordered a flight of vodka (four shots) that came in a red square of ice to keep it chilled.  That was the most fun trying all of those and the cool way they had of presenting it.\n\nWe of course being the model customers had to have drinks, dessert and appetizers because you know that's where they make their money.  It was all so eloquently done we hardly minded the $200 that was to come by later.  \n\nThis was a Tuesday night and early (by Vegas standards 6pm) so we had a few other tables near us but not a packed house, which was nice.\n\nJoseph was our server and he completely knew his craft and he was present without being invasive.\n\nI had salmon and it was quite well prepared and not overpriced.\n\nAll in all I would try it again when I'm on the south end of the strip."

Perhaps it was the time that we stopped by which was fairly late in the evening, but it only had a few people inside. We came here looking for a couple of glasses of vodka and some appetizers. I went with one of the bartenders recommendations on the vodka (cant remember the name at the moment) and it wasn't bad. For our appetizer, we ordered the Salt and Pepper Fried Calamari which was pretty good. I think what kept this place from being 4 stars was that the atmosphere was a little lacking that night."

            "review": "Red Square has an old world USSR feel with all the trimmings of revamped Soviet hangout. I first stumbled upon this place two weeks after they opened and have consistently enjoyed the dining experience (about 8 times in total). The last time I was there was a week ago.\n\nRestaurant / Decor:\nAs you approach Red Square, two things will stand out, one, a huge statue of Lenin that looks like it has lived there for 50 years with all the trappings of pigeon minus the head and a large Russian stylized casement window to a freezer that holds some of the most exotic vodkas on the market today. The decor has changed some since the first year of operation to help accommodate their popularity but it has not significantly taken away from the overall experience. The furniture is all antiqued and the walls are designed as if it is pealing back decades of propaganda. The lush red velvet curtains and huge chandeliers makes it out to be a place where the Kremlin elite would come to have a drink with less than subtle hints of it's past as maybe a church or where Bolshevik revolutionaries might have hung out. The restaurant is very clean. Relatively accessible within Mandalay Bay Casio (casino's are hard to navigate in general). Though it has little online presence. \n\nSpecialty / Favorites:\nThe drinks!  They host the largest selection of vodka's I have ever experienced and I love vodka. I have been exposed to new vodka's for the first time there by ordering tasting flights (explained below). They also have an awesome selection of cocktails from savory to sweet, all worth tasting. \n\nFood / Drink:\nThey have had good consistency for many years though I would be remise if I did not say this last time was not as good as past dining experiences there.  \n\nThere menu is relatively consistent with a few changes here and there though I am not sure if it is seasonal or otherwise.  \n\nFor starters the Steak Tartare (raw beef, onion, capers, dijon mustard-anchovy sauce, creme fraiche, with melba toast) is fabulous, prepared at the table and good to the last bite. The Lobster Bisque has not been consistent and I have been disappointed with it, though the Chilled Lobster Salad (with cold lobster, tomatoes, baby greens, basil oil and lemon creme fraiche) was really awesome though I think it is a seasonal dish since I did not see in on the menu this time. I personally always order Caviar Smothered Blini (a large Russian blini smothered in creme fraiche, American sturgeon caviar and herbed beurre blanc, a potato pancake with caviar and a creamy sauce).  \n\nAs for the entrees, the classics are all very solid; Chicken Kiev (stuffed with herbs, cheese and butter, served with vegetable rice pilaf and a mushroom and port reduction) and Seared Ahi Tuna (warm Yukon potato salad and chilled asparagus in a spicy tomato dipping sauce) are awesome; the Stroganoff, Roquefort Filet Mignon (potato pure with roasted garlic and red wine sauce) and Salmon Kulebyaka (salmon seared with dill on a puff pastry with a dill saffron buerre blanc) are also favorites, though I don't like Salmon all that much so it is a shared opinion. \n\nDeserts... The chocolate cake was really good. Sorry, I am normally not very sober by this time.\n\nBut the real reason to go eat at the Red Square is to drink at the Red Square. It is truly all about the vodka. I love vodka. It is one of my favorite alcohols and they offer something here that I had never seen before, Vodka Flights. You can choose from several Vodka Flights, based by geography, ie, American or Russian, by flavorings, potato vodkas or exotic vodkas, etc. You get 4 shots served in a red block of ice. To best describe this you have to imagine a bright red cube of ice with 4 holes for the shot glasses, it is like nothing I have ever experience before. But if raw vodka doesn't float your boat, there are 3 pages of fabulous cocktails that are honestly some of the best drinks I have ever had. The showmanship at the bar is worth ordering five or six alone. \n\nService:\nThis is not 5 five star dining though there is a real attempt to be very professional and take the extra steps to make sure you have all that you need as you would find in a more formal environment. I have found the staff to be attentive, especially with water, which helps with the impending hangover. The wait staff's description of the menu offerings have been accurate and their opinions helpful. \n\nHospitality:\nThe staff is all very friendly and welcoming. There seems to be a pride in their work and most of the wait staff has a passion for food. I have never felt stupid asking a question about the menu.\n\nValue (price vs. overall experience):\nSetting expectations is very important. As experience has taught me, there is no such thing as value in Las Vegas. So in other words I always expect to spend more in Vegas for the same quality or less than I find else where.\n\nMy recommendation is it is worth the experience!"

If you like vodka (in my case LOVE vodka), or even if you don't, this is the cocktail to end all cocktails. It's got something close to 5 shots in it plus a float of stoli elite (5 different kinds of vodka).  But it gets better...the drink doesn't taste like vodka.  It tastes like a delectable cranberry/lime/fizzy thing that won't give you so much as a buzz.  It comes with a mutant-looking candie cinnimon stick that's a great touch.  Well worth it.  It's a vegas must-have.  \n\nOther than the drink, the bar is nifty- great decor (former USSR, the out-front statues head inside the frezzer, and bartops of ice).  Food is great but EXPENSIVE. The other drinks are great too...and I think they're fairly priced for the selection of vodkas, strength of drink and originality."

I love vodka, but since I had an early morning scheduled for the next day, I decided to just stick with wine.  Their wine list is impressive, with prices typical of Vegas restaurants of similar caliber (i.e. expensive).  Since we were in a large group, we were seated in a private room toward the back, so I can't really comment on the decor.  Service was excellent and attentive.  The waiter expertly guided us on choices for both appetizers and entrees.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the calamari, tuna tartare, siberian nachos (essentially smoked salmon on wonton chips), and steak tartare.  All were excellent, especially the siberian nachos.  Next I had the goat cheese salad followed by the salmon kulebyaka, which is a seared filet of salmon sandwiched between puff pastry served over mushroom risotto and topped with an american sturgeon caviar dill-saffron beurre blanc.  The entree was outstanding with a more than generous portion size.  I was stuffed from the appetizers, so I wasn't able to finish my full entree, which usually isn't a problem for me.  We passed on dessert because of our work schedule.  Overall, a great experience.  Entrees range from around $30 to $45, so be prepared to spend some money."

On Thursday night, we went to dinner at Red Square with a large group of like 25 people. I dont know what everyone else thought of the food, but my friend and I didnt care for it much. The table started with the meatball appetizer which was probably the best thing I had there---it was very good. I think it came with like 3 or 4 meatballs in a small skillet and some bread to soak up the marinara sauce. My friend and I ordered the tuna tartar and it was probably the worst tuna tartar I have ever had. It was so so bland. It had no sauce or avocado or anything. We ended up sending it back because it was so plain---and it was served with slices of white toast which was super awkward. For dinner, the server noted that one of the most popular dishes was the Beef Stroganoff so I ordered it and it was very bland---it came with a large piece of beef brisket which was good, and a side of egg noodles with a mushroom cream sauce that was very bland and had no flavor to where I had to add salt to an already sodium filled dish. My friend ordered the same thing and she thought the same thing I did. The guy next to me ordered the stuffed lobster and he said his was very good.\n\nAll in all, I dont think I would go there again. It was quite pricey for what you got and it wasnt that good.
