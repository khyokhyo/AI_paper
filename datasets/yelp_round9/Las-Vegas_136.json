It was nice to have a vegan menu to choose from and there were plenty of options for the meat eaters. You have to try the Mama's Garlic Bread (and Not Your Mama's Garlic Bread for the vegans). It comes with a cooked garlic head you spread on your bread and it is so delicious. We ordered pizza and burgers and they were all excellent. The staff was friendly and provided great service. We ate here twice during our short stay in Vegas and will come back again next time we visit."

I ate here twice during my stay and was happy both times.  \n\nFirst I tried the Vegan Faux Pie which was good.  The second time I got the vegan meatball sandwich, the \"Not You're Momma's Garlic Bread\", and the vegan cake.   The vegan meatball sandwich was good, but the \"Not You're Momma's Garlic Bread\" was amazing - incredibly uniquely flavored, and unlike anything else I've ever had.  It comes with three large slices and on its own would probably be almost enough for a meal. I also recommend the cake - the cake portion was good, and very moist but could have been slightly more chocolatey.  But the frosting was unbelievable."

One thing that really impressed me was the beer selection. TONS of craft beer. Most of it was stuff distributed out to the east coast, so I've seen or tried most of it before but there were enough new things from out west for me to try.\n\nWe each ordered a slice of cheese pizza and the garlic parmesan fries to split. The pizza was pretty sad. Dried out, overcooked, not very cheesy. Reminded me of something you'd get in a high school cafeteria or gas station. The fries were good, and I really liked the pesto aioli. \n\nThe crappy pizza is the real reason for three stars. Everything else was good. Even for the cheap price, it seemed pathetic. When your logo is a damned pizza slice, you should make an effort to make a better pie.\n\nMaybe we were there on a bad day, but at least the happy hour prices were good!"

I was surprised how delicious it tasted because deep fried calamari is not easy to cook. I also had a side of the garlic fries. It was some of the best fries that I've ever had! I love how it comes with the dip on the side. I wanted to try the pizza but I ate alone so appetizers were enough for me. Great customer service!"

I must say I ordered the slice a little well done and it was cooked to perfection.  A little crispy, and just the right temp.\n\nLost of different beers on tap and even more in the bottle for you beer drinkers.  Nice TV's to watch games but no sound, and the location are the only things preventing this place from being five stars.  If you happen to stay at either Luxor or Mandalay, you should come here!"

After politely bringing it to the bartenders attention she quickly took it off the plate and threw it away; immediately went, and started speaking to a manager on the other side of the bar.\nA few moments later, said manager approaches and casually asks about how the appetizer was, while feigning ignorance. \nAfter explaining to her about the tin foil she replied that they cook it in tin foil and that it was perfectly normal. \nI told her to make sure it doesn't happen to any other customers as it is \"not perfectly normal\" \nThat was the end of that.  No compensation.  No apologies.  No nothing. Just your typical Las Vegas customer service that we've all grown so accustomed to. \nThe bill was around 100$ for 2 drinks an appetizer and two entr\u00e9es. \nYou decide if this is a place you want to eat at."

My 3 cousins and I split a large pizza with half/half toppings and it came out exactly as we ordered.  It was pretty greasy but c'mon... it's pizza!  It's supposed to be greasy!  \n\nThe crust was really good as well.  Nice and Crispy!  We also had the Calamari to start which was also pretty good.  \n\nI got to try a bit of the bloody mary which was 'mehh' to 'just ok'.  Service was decent although we did have to ask for our sides of ranch twice.  \n\nI would definitely come back here!"

When we mentioned it to our server, she tried to tell us that it's always like that, but said she'd have her manager come to speak to us. He came over and said that's just how it is because of the bread they use and then they toast it. No attempt at customer service whatsoever! When our pasta came, you could tell it had been sitting for a while. The pasta was so hard it couldn't even be considered al dente and the sauce dried up within minutes. Seriously, the best thing we had there was a tequila shot, and that's because they didn't have to cook it!"

They have a separate vegan menu that does not limit you to just pizza.  As I am a die hard pizza fan, I had to have the personal pan.  This is one large pie! The crust is paper thin and to die for.  They put on  just the right amount of garlic and Daiya cheese. Since I polished off the whole thing, its a good thing I had to walk back to my hotel. \n\nI have been to Vegas before and ate a lot of Subway. This time, I had better options almost everywhere I went.  I saved a copy of the menu so I can reminisce!  I did have to laugh when the waiter came to take our order and I ordered off the vegan menu, he actually said, \"You know that's vegan, right?\" Yes, my friend, that is why I plowed  through 2,957 tourists to get here before lunch!\n\nI can still taste the garlic..."

The pesto on it was perfect (not too much) and the whole clove of roasted garlic on the side...I ate almost the whole thing by myself. I saved the last of it to spread on my pizza and I even squished out the last tiny bit and licked it off my finger...yep it was that good!\n\nHubby and I ordered an 18\" Vegan Faux Pie and let me tell you...it was perfect. Not toooo much cheese. Even though I'm not a huge fan of Daiya cheese I really liked it on this pizza because they did not use too much. Sometimes it can get all goopey if your not careful with it. The veggies were cooked perfect and the sauce was seasoned perfect and I liked the little kick that it had to it. I was excited that we had a bunch of pieces left over :)\n\nI convinced our friend to trade me one of his vegan buffalo pizza pieces and it was super duper good also. I just really liked our veggie pizza better and I'm trying to limit my soy meat products right now.\n\nOur service was perfect and with our large group...we have zero complaints!

He even throws up blood from time to time due to the severity of his sensitivity. I wanted to treat him to a nice lunch and got very excited when I saw that this place was advertised as gluten free and vegan. Upon ordering we were informed that the pizza was cooked in an oven with other items but that it was still gluten free so we proceeded with the order. The waitress then informed us that the pizza was very small and we would want to add something else to our order. I asked which items were gluten free and she informed me that the wings were gluten free. Upon receiving the appetizer we were told they were cooked in the same fryer and were not in fact gluten free after we had started eating. After leaving my husband got violently ill and called to complain. We were informed that it was our fault for ordering the items because of cross contamination that we should have been knowledgable of. \nWe only went to this place because it was advertised as gluten free. We would not have ordered if we knew that NONE OF THEIR ITEMS ARE ACTUALLY GLUTEN FREE\nThe customer service after this mistake was just added insult. The manager was unapologetic and uncaring of our situation. He claimed that they ask about celiacs disease and give warnings about cross contamination which was not even slightly hinted at. He also said that there was a miscommunication when in fact we were blatantly lied to. We specifically asked questions regarding my husbands allergies and were instructed to purchase items that conflicted with these allergies. If you advertise that items are gluten free they need to actually be gluten free. \nYOU WOULD NEVER SERVE SOMEONE WITH A SEVERE NUT ALLERGY A DISH CONTAMINATED WITH NUTS"

It was around 3:30 on a Tuesday so there were only like four other booths taken. \nOur server was nice with cool tattoos and recommended her favorite dishes. We ordered wings and since they were half off for happy hour we ordered a BBQ and a hot. Both were delicious! My favorite part of the meal. The BBQ had a little kick too it and was that sticky sauce you lick off your fingers..yum! They were very big with a lot of moist meat. My only complaint would be that the hot flavor was not hot enough for my taste. We also ordered a Caesar salad which was really good too, the croutons were very garlicy and the sauce very creamy. The pizza was kind of greasy and the crust underdone. So the app and salad was what brought my rating up to 4 stars!\nNot great on the pizza, but the wings were amazing! And salad great!"

We had the pizza by the slice last time we were there and it had too much oregano, but this time we ordered chicken parm at the bar with the sauce on the side and buttered fettucine on the side.  SOOOO good!!  The sauce would have been overpowering for me and probably too much on the chicken, making it soggy, but with it on the side, the crispy chicken and fettucine could shine through and I added the sauce as I wanted.  \n\nAlso, the bartender was so friendly and nice and totally made all of our weird requests seem like no big deal.

We always have great service and they have awesome music playing on the restaurant juke box, BUT when 2 salads and 2 drinks total up to over $50 with tip, it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. BEST ADVICE: come during happy hour and eat off that menu. Otherwise, it is wayyyy overpriced for a pizza place. The vegan chick'n wings are good and reminiscent of cafeteria chicken Mcnuggets. My sister, the vegan, likes the meatless meatball sub with fries. For the non-vegan food, the Caprese salad is delicious, but adding some extra protein will cost you - a lot. I really wasn't that impressed with the pizza, and none of us ordered it again after our first visit. Overall, lots of options for vegans but with a hefty price tag."

            "review": "We had a free $25 restaurant.com certificate and chose to use it at Slice for no other reason than we saw it on the list of restaurants and recognized the name.  It was a Saturday night and the place wasn't too packed.  There were a few booths available but they sat us in one of those booth/chair combo tables where a bunch of tables are lined up in front of one long booth.  I explain this because it becomes an issue later on.  \n\nWe ordered drinks (good selection of beers.  My husband was happy to get Magic Hat #9).  We chose Mamma's Garlic Bread as an appetizer.  When it came out, the runner was going around to each table asking if it was theirs.  Ahh!  I want my garlic bread, come here!  Served on a small pan with a roasted garlic head.  Interesting and kind of waste of a garlic head if you ask me but I'm only a moderate garlic lover, not a garlic-loving freak who needs a side of garlic head lol.  But the bread was pretty good.  \n\nFor dinner I ordered a bowl of pasta(bilities) (haha, cute.  Yes, I'm easily amused) and chose rigatoni with the spicy marinara sauce.  The server asked me if I wanted to add a side of meatballs or a salad and I said no.  My husband ordered the meatball hero which came with fries, and he substituted regular for garlic shoestring fries.  I'm so glad he did - they were delicious.  Anyway, my meal arrived with 2 meatballs on either side of it.  I didn't order meatballs so I just scooped them off on to a side plate.  (Not a vegetarian, I just don't like things that are too \"meaty\".  heh.  I just walked into a bunch of one-liners, I'm sure.  But you know what I mean.)  The server apologized and offered to bring me a new bowl of pasta if I was a vegetarian.  I told her there was no need for a new bowl, but I was glad she offered. \n\nThe marinara sauce wasn't bad but it tasted as though a lot of red pepper was the only reason it was \"spicy\" and not regular marinara sauce.  My husband enjoyed his meatball hero.  For dessert we had the sack of dough balls.  I thought these were going to be lighter, like zeppoles.  They could have been a lot more enjoyable if they had more cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on the outside and they didn't pour so much sea salt over the chocolate/hazelnut sauce. \n\nWe're nearing the end of our meal and they seat a family of five right next to us... in a table of 4.  They did this on the side we were sitting on so a young boy wound up sitting RIGHT next to me as though we were in the same group.  This really didn't bother me except I thought that if I were that family I'd be pretty pissed that one of the kids has to sit in between two different tables.  We were almost done - they could have had the family wait 10 minutes to put two tables together.  And of course, I had to slide to the other side of my table to exit, which was only a small inconvenience but just made me annoyed that they would consider this setup in the first place.  \n\nThe prices were not over the top, but you just don't get enough \"wow\" for your money here.  A single cheese slice (which I didn't try) is $4.95.  The decor is very hip and environment is pretty chill.  There is an internet juke box and the music playing was very good.  Some classic rock and you could tell the bartenders skip over songs they don't like.  It could be good or bad depending on who's listening.  \n\nOverall we probably wouldn't choose to come back unless we were in Mandalay Bay with others who wanted to try this place.  It was a decent one-time thing.  If you're there and you're feeling it, give it a shot."

We were drawn in by half price cheese slices, so we walked in and got a table. They also offer half price appetizers. We decided to start with one slice each, as they are pretty big. We also wanted to try the meatball appetizer. Upon placing our order, we are told that there is a minimum of two cheese slices per person...odd! Clearly the intention is to fill you up on cheap cheese pizza so you order less of the more expensive stuff. We didn't fall for that so one of us ordered two slices and had our one slice each. How was the food? Nothing terribly special unfortunately. The cheese pizza was super salty and the meatballs while good were generic and seemed about the same caliber as the frozen variety. Would we come here again to try the actual entrees?....no, there are far many better options in the same building even."

(Setting the bar really, really low). \n\nThe cheese, sauce and toppings were all tasty however since the pizza had been setting out and they don't reheat it prior to serving, the cheese got hard and lost its hold onto the crust. \n\nThe crust was the real disappointment though. The crust had no rise and no chew but it wasn't thin crust. It was a dense crust with a thin ring around similar to what I would expect at a high school cafeteria. On top of that the crust was burnt on the bottom, but not in the good way like you'd expect from a Napoletana pizza. This just had a crispy exterior and a light acrid flavor. \n\nIt's not really fair to judge a whole restaurant based on a slice from the counter so take this review with a shaker of salt."

Food is overpriced, most items are $20+ while just a few are $15 and below. The coupon you get when checking into this, does not make up for paying as much as you do.\n\nWe ordered an 18\" meat lovers pizza that was $30. We wanted to get a create your own pizza, but doing that with just one topping would have been $25, so we went with the signature pizza instead. It was very greasy, but there was more than enough of meat on every slice. We also got a pasta; angel hair-Alfredo ($15) with chicken (extra $5). The portion was good enough to split with two people, but the taste was very bland, there was also very little cube cut chicken pieces so paying the extra $5 was not worth it.\n\nBefore we sat down we noticed one of my family members wasn't doing so well due to his diabetes so we asked our server to please quickly bring us bread, water and anything else they had ready. Although we had stated why we needed it in a timely matter, we still had to wait about 10 minutes before we even received our water! One of our other family members had to go across the store to a mini mart and buy a few snacks for him, and also went in the \"walk in buy a slice\" area of this restaurant to get a pizza. Many waitresses were just looking at us nervously, which was bothersome.\n\nOverall: overpriced, nice, but slow staff, food could have tasted better."

We were seated quickly which was ultimately a reason we pick the restaurant because the burger place next-door had a huge wait. I was really glad we did as everyone like their food. Our server was friendly attentive and helpful. The price is reasonable but in typical Vegas fashion slightly high. I would certainly eat at this place again. They also have a quick takeout window if you just looking to get a quick slice."

Had the vegan \"chicken\" wings and they were really good... but a little bit too small for the price. Had the \"meatball\" vegan pizza and it was to die for. I absolutely love their \"meatballs\".

We could tell the bartender was busy but she took care of us pretty quickly and got our order in and got us some drinks. We were hungry so we ordered a pizza and some fries. After 40 minutes it was apparent there was something wrong in the kitchen. No one had a pizza at their table.  A few finally came out and they were for people who came in 15 minutes after us!  So, after an hour of waiting, with no one coming to check on us or tell us anything i asked the manager, Christy, about the status of our order. She was completely unprofessional and rude. According to her they were technically closed and re opened to accommodate \"your group\" and they were shorthanded. We should be patient and grateful that they were serving us.  WHAT!?  I was not part of any group that caused her back up. And furthermore, lady, you were not accommodating me, you reopened cause you saw a chance to make some money. If you didn't have the manpower, CHRISTY, you shouldn't have opened.  Minimum you should APOLOGIZE and check on my freaking order. And if you were having issues you should have stopped by sooner to let us know. Horrible customer service.  Will never go back and will warn EVERYONE."

The pizza itself was thin and soggy and all the toppings were on the verge of sliding off and into my lap.  Not a great start.  While the bites with toppings and cheese had okay flavor, once you hit the crust, it's game over.  Tasteless!  \n\nSlice of Vegas is quick and speedy but they could use some work on developing more flavor.  What I would have done for a packet of crushed red pepper.  Meh!"

Slice of Vegas is located in Mandalay bay, just right next to Burgr bar. The place is big for a pizzeria but there is always a lot of people waiting to be seated.  \n\nThe menu contains a typical selection of pizza, and my favorite pizza is the \"miles 10 meat\" pizza. like the name implies, the pizza has 10 different kind of meat on it. good thing about slice of vegas is that, the pizza was never frozen, u can really taste the freshness of it. The pizza slices were thin. it has that crispiness that I really like, with a perfect amount of chewiness. and the flavor is really good. \n\nI have only tried 2 of their pizza at this place, the miles 10 meat and the 4 cheese truffle. The sauce on the pizza was good. its the perfect amount. on the miles 10 meat, the sauce was dark red, and a bit sweet. u cant really taste the tomato flavor of it, which is a good thing for me, since I hate tomatoes. The amount of cheese on it was in good balance. All the ingredients on the miles 10 meat were tasty. The 4 cheese truffle is good, but tends to be very oily. \n\nOverall, the pizza were really good and I would really recommend it. its not really a wow factor but we are in vegas and not nyc. I think the pizza really taste good. it has the perfect balance of sauce, toppings and cheese. it has that perfect crispiness with every bite. ull even lick ur fingers, coz its that finger lickn good. lol."

Fresh toppings, tasty sauce, good amount of cheese. The crust was thin, which was perfect for us, but it was a little too crispy.  Probably about an 1/8 of an inch of hard crispiness.

Our waitress was good about checking on us often.  It did take a bit to get the final bill from her but overall she was good, very friendly.\n\nI had the Choked Pig pizza.  Toppings included Pesto aioli sauce, Mozzarella cheese, sun dried tomatoes, bacon and artichoke mix finished with chopped basil and a whiskey sour cream.  It was very tasty.  The Pesto was delicious but not overly strong.  The other toppings were great.  My mom had a basic pepperoni pizza which she enjoyed.  I ate both pizzas cold the next day and they were still good.\n\nThis is definitely a great place to go if you are looking for a really good thin crust pizza.  It looks like the place gets pretty wild with music and drinks on some nights."

This restaurant is located in the Mandalay Place right on the Strip.\n\nI have been to this spot two different times and have experience the good and the bad that comes with dining out. First time I came here, I was here with family during dinner time.We came here to get a bite to eat as we had been drinking and needed to sober up.\n\nWe shared a pizza and a Caesar Salad. The Caesar salad was different from any other one of its kind that I've ever had. Made with romaine, broccoli, croutons and their house Caesar dressing, which in my opinion of of the best tasting dressing I've had!!! Topped with fried anchovies, grilled lemon and fresh Parmesan. Cost $11.95. The portion was big enough to share among four adults. We also shared a 18-inch Nonna's Margherita pizza, which is made of fresh mozzarella cheese and fresh basil. Not the best, but not the worst. Flavor was good, but it was dry. This cost $29.95.\n\nSecond time I came, I came during lunchtime. This time, we had to wait as there were so many people. I waited about 20-25 minutes before I was seated. I was seated toward the back at a tiny table with hardly any elbow space. To make things easy, I and my guest decided on just getting waters as it took forever for our waiter to get to us. Upon looking over the menu, my guest decided on the Delitalino sandwich, which is made of imported Itailian meats of cappicola, salami and ham. Along with provolone cheese, tomatoes, onions, pickles, romaine lettuce and seasoned with dried oregano and Italian dressing. It came with a side salad of their choice. Cost $14. I ordered the Scotty's Chicken sandwich with a side garden salad. The sandwich was made of a grilled chicken breast, which was so tender and moist. Topped with a roasted tomato, pickle, basil pesto, fontina cheese and jalape\u00f1o bacon. The garden salad was made of spring lettuce mix, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions and edamane. Seasoned with an Italian dressing, which I replaced with ranch. Their ranch dressing here is so delicious!! This also cost $14. Both sandwiches and salads were amazing. Which almost made up for the lack of service we received during this visit. \n\nCon's:\n1. This place is so popular that there is always a line of people waiting to eat here. The tables don't get cleared off quick enough to accommodate the the customers.\n2. It is always so loud. Don't come here if you want an intimate experience or want to be able to actually have a conversation with your guest without having to yell.\n3. During popular hours, don't expect to get great customer service. I feel like for the amount of people that come thru here, they never have enough staff working. Our waiter had a huge section all to himself and was running around crazy trying to take orders and make sure his customers were satisfied, but in the process, I had to wait forever to get my lunch and for him to bring my check to me. \n\nI would come back again, as the food is really good here."

This pizza shop is actually inside a mall, which made it a little difficult to park and find at first. Once inside the mall, it was super easy to find and it stuck out.\n\nThe hostesses were very nice, as was the female server we had. The boy and I ordered salads...just kidding! What do you think we ordered? Pizza of course! We opted for the 18 inch 'Choked Pig' which had pesto aioli sauce, mozzarella cheese, sun dried tomatoes, a bacon and artichoke mix, then basil on top. This pizza was delicious; and HUGE! I think we ended up saving 4 pieces which equated to a whole 'nother meal which was awesome. This size pizza was roughly $30 but they also have a 12 inch for $19, or a 10 inch gluten free for $17. I would have loved to try the gluten-free, and it's awesome they actually offer it.\n\nFor dessert, we order the cannolis. The best I've ever had was up north in New England, but these were a close second! You can tell they know how to make em because they only fill them RIGHT after you order them. Lots of places keep them filled and this results in a soggy outside. These were yummy with pistachios, chocolate chips, and chocolate sauce and were nice and crunchy!\n\nOh, I also had a Restaurant.com voucher and we were able to use it. I think we ended up having to order a coffee or something so we could reach the certain amount of money we were supposed to spend, then we got a certain amount off. Pretty cool! They are very willing to accept anything from Restaurant.com. Made the meal EVEN cheaper!"

All they have to do is use a different cheese and charge a premium for it. Not like they have to change all ingredients in making the pizza. So I am very glad this place allows me to come with my friends and we are all able to get something to eat. \n\nI tried their Vegan Supreme Pizza. I have to say that while vegan pizza will probably never be as good as the \"real thing\", this rates a solid 7/10. \n\nThe dough is very good, the sauce used was not that bad ( a little too thick for my personal taste but good nevertheless) the cheese used I believe is regular Daiya, which vegans have a love or hate relationship with. It's not my cheese of choice for pizzas I make at home but it's decent. \n\nThe only con is the price. It is quite expensive, I ended up paying about $35 after taxes for an 18\".  \n\nI understand they charge a solid $7-8 premium on top of the vegan pizzas, and again, no complaints at all, at least they're giving us an option. BUT it's not like I can go there every weekend and grab a pizza, so unfortunately the price is much higher than i'd expect to pay for a pizza. \n\nVery decent taste. Very Expensive as well. Will I go back?  On rare occasions due to the price. But I can see myself trying their other flavors."

It wasn't busy so I'm not sure why it hadn't been wiped down. The cashier seemed to be just going through the motions, super average place at best."

            "review": "Looking for a fresh, laid back bar scene in Vegas without the flashy lights and cigarette smoke? In that case, definitely check out Slice of Vegas. This little gem is hidden in the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay and we wandered in during their happy hour from 3 to 6p. If you have ever been to Vegas you know that prices are all over the place and the majority of places range on the pricier end. Looking at the menu, SOV is also one of those places but during happy hour, all drafts, slices, and select apps are half off. SCORE. \n\nWe posted up at the bar and had two bartenders during our venture here - both were lively, super friendly, and attentive. We order two slices of pepperoni and sausage plus their mild wings and a few beers. The slices were large and foldable - not quite NY style huge but close enough for me. The sausage had great flavor and the crust was just slightly crispy... exactly how I like it. The wings were fantastic. Period. Crispy outside. Juicy inside. Mild sauce had great flavor without being too spicy. In fact, there were so good we ordered a second batch and stuffed ourselves full. \n\nThis bar had a great local selection as well - plenty of Las Vegas brews as well as a handful of domestics and other well- known craft breweries. Looking at the menu, I was tempted to order the Miles 10 Meat pizza but didn't have the stomach to do it.... seriously, I was so damn full. But the Miles 10 is cheese and 10 meats. Yes 10 MEATS and no stupid veggies to ruin the heart attack pie. Topped with proscuitto, capicola, pork, bacon, and more, this is definitely going to be a go to spot of mine next time I'm in Vegas just for that pizza. \n\nThe place is pretty small (but hey, it's located inside shops) and I hated to see it closed at 11pm. Maybe it was just the time of year we were there, I'm not sure. But all in all, if you are looking to grab a beer and some grub, this is definitely a spot to go - heads up, be sure to go during happy hour. The wings we received, while delicious, we $5.50 for six of them meaning they are $11 normally. Holy hell. But hey, when in Vegas...."

My friend ordered the meatballs and wow is was like frozen meatballs overcooked and dump in sauce. Would not recommend this flavorless meal. Also we ordered both soups and they were both really disgusting. The Tuscan had wayyy too much Tabasco added into it, and I love Tabasco... The other soup was just flavorless. It was like drinking water. Honestly a waste of money. Go to the food court a little farther down and get something cheaper."

Chewy, bready crust slathered with sauce, generously topped with quality ingredients, finished with an almost excessive amount of cheese.   Over the top in true Vegas Strip fashion.\n\nSauces are bold and flavorful.  The pies are well seasoned and not excessively oily thanks to the fresh (not processed) cheeses.  The \"Miles 10 Meat\" pizza with its outstanding three meat bolognese sauce and toppings of prosciutto, pepperoni pancetta, sausage, bacon, mortadella and cappacola toppings is a meat lovers delight.  The \"Mushroom Ragu\" is another standout.  The perfect mix of earthy mushrooms paired with creamy, melted, fresh mozzarella.\n\nAll is not perfect, the crust in the middle of every pie so far has been soft from excessive sauce.  It becomes the stuff of legend if you like to indulge on cold pizza the next morning.\n\nYou can build your own pie from an extensive list of ingredients.  Slices are also offered along with salads, pastas, and sandwiches.\n\nService is fast and friendly.\n\nVery good selection of beers on tap or by the bottle.  Prices are higher than it's Mandalay Place neighbors.\n\nStrip indulgence comes at a price:  $19 for a 12\" pie, $30 for an 18\"; build your own starting at $15 (12\"), $23 (18\") adding $2 per topping.\n\nRecommended."

I rather pay more money for quality than have a free nasty meal! \n\nA good side effect of a thin crust pizza is it's enough to soak up the alcohol, but doesn't make you feel all bloated and nasty and lethargic, so you can still get into your skank dress and not feel like a sausage!"

I tried both the Meatless Meatball and The Vegan Faux Pie- both were delicious. As far as sides go, the Meatless Meatballs were good but a very small portion for the $ & the what I thought were faux 'chicken wings' turned out to be what we in the UK would deem were chicken nuggets?

The burger meat itself was top notch, tender and flavorful. However the flavor doesn't stop there. Mushrooms, grilled onions, JALAPE\u00d1O BACON, and avocado, yes avocado. This complex burger is perfect in texture and flavor. Try it with sweet potato fries. The very next day I had to have it again, so I did. There are many different options for food, but I couldn't bring myself to pass it up. Cool bar and even cooler bartender. Johanna said it was her first day, but that was very hard to believe. She was very attentive and knew how to handle the rush, a true pro, not to mention very friendly with a great smile. I have to finally recommend the Red Tail Ale, what a brew.

I appreciate that they waned to accommodate but it wasn't great. \n\nProbably not worth the $36 we spent but definitely helped the hangover"

            "review": "Dear Slice of Vegas,\nIt disheartens me to have to write this letter about the experience myself and 9 of my friends had at your restaurant tonight. \n-Tonight 10 friends of mine all got together to celebrate an upcoming wedding in our group of friends.\n-We arrived at Slice of Vegas about 7:45 PM and were promptly seated in your nice back room by no later than 7:55 PM. \n-We were greeted by our waiter who took our drink order and then followed up to take our dinner order with normal service.\n-Before ordering we requested our bill to be split about 5 ways, that's just how it is when you are in big groups. \n-When it came time for us to order while ordering we specifically asked for some extra sauce on the side of our meal. \n-All of our meals came out promptly/hot but were delivered by somebody other than our waiter and that's when everything started to go downhill for our group. \n-This is the beginning to when we never saw our waiter again. \n-After 15 minutes of having an empty water cups, and not receiving the extra sauces I requested on the side of my wife and my meal I went out to the main dining area with my wife's and my water cups to be refilled by the bar tender. The bartender wouldn't fill my cups instead she flagged down the original waiter who from the other side of the room shouts \"What do you need!\" In a disinterested tone. I raised up my two empty glasses of water and approached him, he said he'll bring them to the table, I also requested the sauces that I had ordered with the meal (ranch and marinara). \n-He did then promptly came to the table with 2 waters for us after I did this, and told me the sauces are on their way, but he didn't take the time to ask anybody else if they needed anything (3/4 of the drinks, waters and $2.95 sodas were empty). We still had never had the usual \"Did everything come out alright?\" that you get, especially when you weren't the actual waiter that handed out the food. \n-After about 7 more minutes of waiting for the sauces (and \u00be of all the food eaten on the table), I approached the main dining room where he looked at me from across the room and shouted again \"what do you need!\" This time seeming irritated and not caring at all, it was at this exact time the sauces were being delivered by another waiter. \n-We continued to complete our meal, but still had absolutely 0 interaction at our table in the back room with our waiter since we gave him our order at the beginning of the evening. Everybody still had empty drinks and nobody had come by to check up on us.\n-After about 20 minutes of us all sitting there, waiting for our checks I had, had enough of this nonsense and talked to the \"manager\" of the night. I explained to him, verbatim what I just described to you, drinks had never been refilled, sauces didn't come until the meal was practically completed, never seen our waiter again. I asked the manager \"Joseph\" if he felt the service we had received was \"unacceptable\". Joseph would not agree/use the word unacceptable, he would transition into saying it's busy, and apologized. I informed him again about the horrible and lack of service that was provided and once again inquired to see if it he felt it was \"unacceptable\" once again he changed the subject to doing their best and it's really busy. So I inquired as to if this is what service should be like and is expected to be like in this restaurant, because if so I'd like to inform my friends. He said \"No, it isn't\" so I informed him then it's \"unacceptable\" isn't it.\n-The checks were finally brought out. No nice check folder, just a Hodgepodge of nonsense handing them out willy-nilly. To my frustration, we all found that a 20% gratuity was automatically added to all our checks. This I felt was beyond unacceptable for the amount of service/lack of service rendered for the evening.\n-I Approached the manager about it, he said it's company policy and he \"can't do anything about it\", I explained again all the things we had been through in the evening again (we just had this conversation less than 4 minutes ago) he continued with his story of \"it's corporate policy we can't change it\" this went on for over 8 minutes until I told him, if that is company policy then we are all paying cash and leaving no tip at all if that is how the company does business. He then finally agreed to remove the tip, but in a last attempt to still do little to nothing about the situation he tried to just take it off my 1 check out of the 5 at the table. I then requested he take it off all 5 of our checks, which he finally did. After this was all said and done we noticed that your waiter had put 2 $.50 sauces on everyone's bills. There was no notification that it was an upgraded charge for sauce, and not everyone wanted sauce or ranch and I guarantee there were more charges for sauces on all our bill than actual sauces were provided to our table which is fraud.\n\n-It was very clear this waiter thought they would automatically get their 20% tip from our t"

They must be doing something right if we went back two times in the same night, right?\n\nEarlier in the experience I did go for dinner and once again had the hangover pizza. It didn't quite have the same flare as last time so I'm open to trying the meatball sandwich next time since from the previous experience I sampled a meatless meatball and couldn't tell the difference. Not to say that the pizza was bad this time because that's far from the truth as I found the dough very soft and light on the muffin top as I walked away!\n\nLater on after watching Michael Jackson one we decided to come back and mosey up to the bar for some alcoholic hi-jinx. What stuck out was the Italian Creamsicle. It was what I call a sleeper drink because it goes down sweet, but once consumed takes you to an inebriated happy place. The bartender appeared like she was training, but beyond being amazingly beautiful she made sure we were always taken care of. Although the drink sounded fruity on paper with banana liqueur, orange juice, and pineapple juice she made mine a bit more heavy on the rum which I had no complaints about.\n\nI would recommend this for a more quieter paced setting and drink selection was pretty extensive between mixed drinks and otherwise. It was reasonably priced and thankfully not overpriced compared to other places. On a plus you can shell out $14 and get a souvenir glass to take home. Cheesy and touristy in that regard, but at least it's memories nonetheless"

A small specialty pizza with a ton of toppings was $18 opposed to 4 slices for $24.  You can't get any more toppings than their ridiculous Miles 10 Meat pizza.  That's \"made with a bolognese mix of veal, pork, and ground beef, smothered in mozzarella cheese, and topped with prosciutto, pepperoni, pancetta, sausage, bacon, mortadella and cappacola.\"  No pizza could possibly be bad when it has all this.  It was really good.\n\n$18 for a small pizza is a little more than I want to spend but this is probably one of the cheapest places to do dinner at Mandalay Bay.

Thank goodness I only ordered one with one topping. I would have been really miffed if I would have gotten one of the specialty ones that was 19$ for that dinky of a pizza. Salads are crazy over-priced- I mean crazy...$12 for a salad they said was supposed to have a variety of items besides lettuce. Was almost all lettuce and a pittance of the other items. Beer prices are a little high as well. Service was a mix- waiter was very nice and helpful. However one of the hostesses was literally a deer in headlights. She must have literally stared at me for 4 or 5 minutes while I stood in front of her. I finally had to say I had a reservation and she was like \"Oh\" It was really weird and then sadly her manager remarked that she's \"highly qualified to be a hostess\" instead of saying he was sorry for what happened. Strange management. Incredibly overpriced. A big waste of your time. The taste of the food is just over a 3 out of 5, but their cheapness in ingredient use and price-gouging lands them an overall 2. If you come here, you surely won't leaving saying the food tasted bad, but you might be mad at yourself for the reasons mentioned above.

So we booked at the Mandalay, knowing there'd at least be the best pool in the world to soothe the pain of not being at the Wynn.  What I didn't know was that there'd also be Slice of Vegas to make me SO SO happy!\n\nIt's a casual Italian eatery, and coming from the suburbs of Philly, I felt right at home.  Nothing fancy, not too much hoopla, just standard American-Italian fare that fills your belly with a warm light (and maybe acid reflux) that you'll carry with you for the rest of the day.  This, my friends, is comfort food.\n\nWhat sets Slice of Vegas apart from the pizza joints of my youth is their amazing vegan menu!  Not even kidding you, it has everything you could possibly ever want at a place like this.  Pizza, pasta, salads (really? you're eating a salad?), appetizers, sandwiches, DESSERTS.....oh lordy, they thought of everything.  They left no stone unturned.\n\nI was lured by the meatball sandwich, and went high to hog heaven with the first bite.  A great roll (they even call it a hoagie roll, like my people back east!!), a rich balanced sauce, the perfect amount of daiya mozzarella, and gardein meatballs, which are probably my favorite outside of homemade.  It came with sweet potato fries, and our darling waitress said the magic words, \"Would you like a side of ranch with that?\"  WOULD I?!  Gimme gimme gimme.\n\nSam was perfectly content with his spaghetti and spicy marinara, and would've come back for it every meal if I'd let him.  We stuffed ourselves silly and had no room for dessert, which was the saddest thing.  I even tried to come back later after a night of dancing, but they were long closed.  Alas, I can add this place to my repertoire of super vegan friendly restaurants in Vegas, and I'm very happy that I don't absolutely have to go to the Wynn to be well fed (to the point of bursting)."

I thought I would be doing her a favor by taking her $100 restaurant.com coupon off of her hands since she didn't have a smart phone or access to a computer/printer.  My bad...\n\nFirst,  I tried a really nice restaurant,  but they would only let me use $25 at a time. Next,  I drove to 2 Japanese restaurants,  but they both didn't accept the coupon.  Then I drove to a diner, but they closed at 3pm. I should have checked my Yelp app since the restaurant.com app didn't update the diner's hours. \n\nFinally,  I called A Slice of Vegas and made reservations with the friendly receptionist.  I walked all over Mandalay Bay casino,  but could not find the restaurant.  By this time, I was at the fainting/exasperated point.  I called the receptionist again and she patiently guided me through all of the shops to her smiling face! \n\nThe energetic and helpful server, Pete,  called his manager to help me figure out how to use the restaurant.com app where I had to order $75 worth of food to use $50 of the coupon. It was so worth it!\n\nThe \"Choked Pig\" pizza had a fantastic thin, crisp crust which went well with the bacon,  artichoke & whiskey sour cream topping.  The Salmon Portofino was seared perfectly with the moist, fresh, firm fish salted & peppered just right!  I ate the Brownie Sundae with gusto and took the cannoli & tiramisu to go with my doggie bag. Am enjoying the leftovers now as I compose this review. \n\nEveryone at A Slice of Vegas was attentive and understanding.  I really appreciate their help and their amazing food!  I learned a lot and will return again for the sandwiches and salads or maybe another pizza!"

The cheesesteak sandwhich was tasty, although a couple of pieces of the steak were a bit chewy.  Nice thin fries with the meal.\n\nThe others had pasta, which you can build by picking the pasta, sauce, and proteins, and they looked very good.  Like any good Italian restaurant, there was more than enough pasta for a meal.\n\nSlice of Vegas offers desserts, and they sound pretty good. However, we were too full from the meal.

He took this place to the next level.\n\nWe ordered Mama's Garlic Bread with Mozzarella. It was very yummy. It came as a serving of four. Four was more than enough to hold us over until the pizza arrived.\n\nWe also ordered a pizza. With the waiter advice, we ordered the 12\" Sausage pizza. It was greasy as heck. It had small puddles all over it, but it was just so damn appetizing. It tasted like a oily heaven. We finished every slice of it.\n\nWe wanted to order the chocolate cake for dessert, but our wonderful waiter mentioned and recommended the Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookie with Vanilla Ice Cream and Caramel. drizzles, that wasn't on the menu. I decided to order it. It took about 10 minutes for us to get the cookie, but when we did get it, it looked delectable.\n\nWe tasted the cookie and it was so warm and gooey. We got maybe half way through the cookie before we discovered that the caramel was salted. Not only was the caramel salted, it was salty. It started to become very unbearable. It wasn't the best. I wish I had just ordered the Cake instead.\n\nOnce the lunch was over, my stomach fell. I had to rush to the restroom. Sorry, I couldn't think of a nice way to say it. My friend's stomach didn't start hurting until she got home, maybe 2 hours later. I believe it was the pools of grease mixed with the taste of the cookie.\n\nI know it was sounds stupid, but it was worth it. We will definitely go back. Next time, we'll just  pour off some of the pizza grease and skip over the cookie."

I'm actually kinda shocked this place has a good amount of bad reviews. \n\nThis is one of my more favorite places to go out of my way for in Vegas for many reasons:\n\n- It's easy to get to. Since it's on the Luxor side of the bridge to Mandalay, don't even bother with the nightmarish Mandalay Bay parking lot, and opt for super easy parking on the Luxor upper parking deck. It always seems to be a shorter and easier walk.\n\n- They have an AWESOME VEGAN MENU with so many amazing offerings. I'm so glad they are advertising this now because before it was kind of by word of mouth only.  The vegan meatballs are a must! You can also get GLUTEN-FREE pizza, although it's only offered in one size (I believe 10\") and does take a bit longer for them to make. They use Daiya Cheese, which is the best! They'll also add it to your vegan salads and other dishes if you ask nicely.\n\n- Great beer selection. Lots of imported stuff. Lots of good stuff on tap. Read the blackboard for the latest.\n\n- They have a to-go window. Convenient!\n\n- Wait staff is friendly, but yes, a little slow. This place gets busy though, and there is a back room where they have a lot of parties from the conference goers. So most of the available wait staff is stuck having to deal with that. No completely their fault. They could do with one less person at the front.\n\nNEWS ALERT FOR THE VEGANS: was told by the waitress last night that the chocolate cake, cheesecake, and the zeppoli (from the normal dessert menu listed on the coffee cans at your table) are all VEGAN!

Regardless of the reason or the time for which we go a Slice of Vegas has become a tradition for us. As a vegan I can attest to the amazing selection of vegan friendly menu items, my absolute favorite is their BBQ chicken pizza and of course the vegan chocolate cake . As a vegetarian my girlfriend loves their pasta and Mac N Cheese. This place is an absolute must!"

It was better if you took some of the fresh garlic provided with it and put it on top.  I ordered it with cheese which I thought would be a sprinkle of cheese, but turned out to be a big glob of cheese on every slice.

Great for pulling in people who want a quick bite.  \nFor this reason, they rip you off with a charge of 7 bucks for a simple slice of pizza.  Didn't notice this until I had already placed my order and that is on me. But I also added a side salad for almost 4 bucks, which I thought would come in a nice container with it all dressed up. No, it comes in a plastic bowl, just some greens thrown in with dressing on the side. Throw in a drink, with lousy options in their dispensers, and you've got an expensive quick bite for almost 16 bucks.\n\nThe pizza wasn't too bad, though nothing special and the salad was too plain.

Billed as a space for \"Fun Italian Dining\" with a take-out station to the left and bar-full of craft brews tucked behind it was just moments before 7:00pm that I took my seat and with the majority of diners tourists with small children the scene was decidedly rambunctious, a duo of servers including the young woman in charge of my table clearly struggling to keep pace with large orders despite efficient back-servers helping to bus tables and refill water.  Unapologetically overpriced like the majority of Strip-side dining it was only after a few questions regarding the possibility of a half-and-half pizza (no for specialties, okay if you build-your-own) plus  a description of the daily specials that I eventually placed an overzealous order and with an appetizer slice of foldable New York style thin-crust quickly arriving from the exterior facing window my first taste was quite favorable, the gentle crunch and pliable crumb on par with that at Pop-Up or Secret beneath a subtly sweet sauce and bubbling fresh mozzarella.  Moving next to mundane garlic bread that no Italian mother would likely lay claim to it was fast on the thick loaf's heels that my gourmet pizza would arrive and with ample toppings showing a keen eye for balance over the nearly cracker thin crust the meal was soon back on good footing, the punchy sour cream a particularly inspired pairing to mellow the marinated artichokes and herbal topnotes from the pesto and fresh basil.  At this point just shy of my gift-certificate minimum I was left with a decision between the restaurant's signature chocolate cake, a glorified brownie sundae, or balls of fried dough and opting for the later with a sidecar of caramel I'm confident to say I made the right choice - each of the seven cue-ball sized doughnuts perfectly crisp and virtually oiless beneath a hefty shake of cinnamon sugar as the duo of sauces jockeyed for position on the tongue's already overcrowded sweetness receptors.\n\nDramatically overpriced without the benefit of a 2/3 discount but featuring a more than competent slice along with the best Zeppoli I've yet to find in Las Vegas there are certainly worse options for quick casual dining on the strip and although neither service nor setting are likely to win any awards I'd happily come back to explore more of the menu if armed with another coupon, a distinct likelihood considering the general dearth of quality on restaurant.com ever since the rest of Mandalay Bay pulled out several months ago."

After ordering two two topping slices I was told that the price was fifteen dollars. I stated that a slice on the menu was less than that. This scholar hunched her shoulders and told me the prices were on the menu. After looking at the pool of grease on the display slices and considering her attitude I left. Then, as if I couldn't eat anywhere else, she shouted \"next!\"  Maybe it would have been effective if someone had been waiting. Too many options to have to put up with stupid. Come on folks, teach your servers the basics of customer service. How many bad reviews before people stop even giving you the chance?  And if you are having relationship problems, call in sick.

Service was spotty. A bit pricey too ($23) for a 18 inch pepperoni \n\nCame here at 11:15PM or so I believe and they we're half way closed, but no problem could still buy the pizza by the slices!\n\nI could not order any new pizzas, but in case you wanted to, it is $18.95 + $1.95 per topping for a large (18inch), 12 inch was $9.95 + $1.95 per topping and have specialties already made that range something like $25. They had some interesting ones like prosciutto and pesto, but I suppose I will have to try next time. \n\nThe girl who helped us was nice, but did not really listen well. My friend asked her to double slice the pizza and with her verbal reply we believe she understood. Unfortunately we walked quite the distance already to realize that she didn't, nor did she reheat the pizzas. I suppose reheating is a personal preference as the pizza was still warm, but to me, if I'm paying $23 for a large pepperoni, I expect it to be hot. \n\nIn the end, a good spot for drunken eats, but many better options on the strip."

I also was coming from a highly isolate hunting community in the middle of northern Canada, so I could be a bad judge but many restaurants in Vegas not only offer vegan options but have a fully vegan menu available upon request. Slice of Vegas was of our first stops, the night we arrived. We were famished, of course. Slice of Vegas is located in lovely Mandalay Place which is easily accessible from the Luxor hotel. Unfortunately, the restaurant was full, so we didn't get to dine in but the waitress told us we could order from their take-out window. That's what we did. Ana and I opted on sharing the BBQ chick'n pizza, Dave went for the meatless meatball sub and we all got a slice of their peanut butter chocolate cake for dessert.\n\nThe food was incredible, flavourful and even the biggest meat-eater would not be disappointed with the vegan food. The cake was simply delicious that I can't help but rave about that all on it's own. It was moist and extremely chocolatey, along with that delicious peanut butter creamy frosting. It was the perfect place to start off my palate's vacation."

It might be easier to get here via Luxor than the Mandalay parking garage..... \n\nI hit up this place with a Groupon in tow.  I was here on a mission -- try the vegan pizza.  Sat at the bar, ordered a (crazy expensive) beer, and ordered the 18\" vegan \"faux pie\" pizza to share with the BF.  Pro tip: the 12\" pizzas are TINY and a rip off at $20 each.  For $30, the 18\" pizzas are still really pricey, but at least you can feed 4 people off of it. (Or two people with plenty to take home!)\n\nThe pizza was super tasty - good crispy crust, nice sauce, good vegan (Daiya) cheese to veg to crust ratio.  If I didn't have to fight my way through the hot mess that is trying to park at Mandalay Bay, and it weren't so expensive, I would eat here all the time! That said, I probably won't frequent this place due to those problems.\n\nThey have a great selection of very expensive beers (I think the cheapest is a $6 bud light equivalent), but that's probably par for the course at a casino.  They have a few good quality drafts (Stone IPA!) and lots of good bottles.\n\nThey also have a few vegan/veganizable pasta options ($12+) and salads ($10).\n\nPizza was delicious leftover cold the next day, so if you're staying at Mandalay, just get the large and eat the rest when you're hungover then next morning.\n\nService was Ok, not lacking nor exceptional.  No restroom.  There are lots of TVs for sports watching (did you know there's a CrossFit Olympics?! that's what was on while I was there.  Nothing helps you work up an appetite like watching impossibly thin and muscled women doing 500 deadlifts and pullups, amirite??)"

I went in expecting just some generic meat/cheese replacements, and that is not what I got at all. \n\nWhen researching places to eat with vegan options, this one came up, but I immediately thought to myself, ive done the fake za before, many times, might want to go with something different. I am glad I made the time to come here. \n\nI ordered the not your mommas garlic bread as an app, since it was happy hour this was half off!!!! Then a Back East Buffalo and the \"cheesecake\" for dessert. \n\nThe garlic bread was good. It was probably what I was most excited about, being a garlic bread fan, although it ended up being my least favorite of the three (but still, very good). There were just enough for 2 to share, so if you have more than 2 I would suggest maybe getting a second order or second ap. \n\nThe pizza was great! It was almost perfect, a refreshing bed of carrots and celery with buffalo sauce, vegan ranch, and gardein chicken and daiya. The carrots and celery made this pie for me, and I hate celery! but this was cut thin and the mingling with buffalo sauce and the ranch made it all delicious. I am not usually a big gardein fan, but this seemed to be marinated in the sauce, and tasted fairly good. My only complaint is that the crust was not evenly cooked, with some burnt like spots on one side, but it wasn't very bad, just that part was extra crunchy. \n\nAnd now the star of the show, the cheesecake. I was expecting generic vegan cheesecake, and I got a great tasting cheesecake if it were to stand alone, but alas it didn't, it came with a pineapple compote that was probably the best tasting fruit compote I have had in my life! So good, lighly herbaceous, just delicious. \n\nService was great throughout, and my dining companion enjoyed her slices as well. Next time im in Vegas, this place I will be!"

This is one of those few places that is attached to Luxor/Mandalay Bay and is decent food at a reasonable price in a good atmosphere. So as a result, I'm giving it 4 stars."

It's more of a thinner crust that has a crisp bite to it.  I have ate here many times and it never disappoints.  The staff is always friendly and the service is quick and easy so you can get in and out and get back to gambling in the casino!   Keep up the great work CHEERS!"

We could see the basil but there was no taste. We told our server ?Brent? but he didn't really seem to care. He brought us our check instead. Having lived around the US including Brooklyn and having italian pizza in Italy, we won't be returning here. I'm glad others haven't had this experience. The prices like most things in Vegas are inflated."

The pizza is thin, the crust is dry. The crust is crunchy and very dry. I wasn't too stoked on it. It's not horrible, but it's not awesome. It seriously just tastes like Tombstone frozen pizza. They do have a decent beer selection though, so that's cool.\n\nThe service was mediocre. Our waitress was cool. She was nice and pleasant and took care of us. The service is just slow, maybe she had too many tables? It took awhile to get our food, it took even longer to get our check. At least she was attentive. \n\nIt seems to me most people who are giving it high ratings are eating off the vegan menu. I would have gladly eaten some items from the vegan menu to try it out, but my gf wasn't feeling it. \n\nI wouldn't eat here again off the normal menu, but I'd try the vegan menu just to see if it really is all that it's hyped up to be. The only reason they got 3 stars is because they have some solid craft beer choices."

Incredible deal considering that the pizza is huge and delicious!!! Limit was 1 per guest and additional toppings was $1.75 each.\n\nWe were one of the first there so we were greeted and seated right away. Julie was our waiter who waited on us very nice and kept making sure we were ok.\n\nWe ordered the jalapeno mac n cheese. I'm usually not a fan of restaurants mac n cheese but this. Omg. So good. It had bacon bits in too. My husband and I shared as an appetizer. It was served in a bread bowl. Which made it even more amazing. We also ordered my boys dough balls to play with while we waited for our food.  They were $2 each and so worth it.  The boys really enjoyed them lol \n\nOnly down fall for me was that they had no discounts on beer for locals. I understand being inside a casino on the strip they up beer prices for that reason. But again being local I wish I got a discount. They had some pretty awesome beers on draft that I wanted to try more of.  \n\nAll in all this place is awesome! I'd come back again."

It mostly consists of Gardein and Daiya based recreations of their regular menu. Hey, this is Vegas damnit! Nobody comes here to eat salad.\n\nWith so many options to choose from, I skipped the Buffalo Pie in favor of the regular version so that my babygirl would be able to share the pizza with me as she isn't too keen on spiciness. The thin crust was so so, but the rest was Daiya & faux meat heaven. I'm not the biggest Daiya fan, but it is great substitute for pizza.\n\nI ordered a side of Vegan Buffalo Strips as an appetizer for myself. If I had known they wouldn't be very spicy, I would've went with the atomic sauce instead. It was odd they put the sauce on the side, rather than smothered into the strips. Perhaps it would've given it more flavor as well as the joy of getting your fingers messy as you much away on Buffalo sauced goodness. I enjoyed this but at $10.95, it's a bit pricey. Even for Vegas...\n\nI wish I was hungrier on this visit as the menu had so many options to from. Various appetizers, pasta, soups, salads, desserts and more. So many pastabilities, so little room in my tummy. The prices could be lower for the quality of the food, but I can't complain too much. Even though I'm rating this 3.5 stars, I'm rounding up for the simple fact that this type of Vegan food in Vegas is a rare find, and the simple fact that I will be back again to try out more things. Oh, and to get that atomic sauce."

They also had quite a number of good-looking side dishes ( such as spicy, roasted cauliflower ) and I imagine this would have been yummy on their cheese pizza..... alas, Sis doesn't like spicy & we wanted to get something Sis, Mr & I could all share\n\nSo we opted for the 4 Cheese w/ Truffle Oil.

As a local - it's always entertaining to spend a few hours on a Friday night at the Strip - looking at all tourists so we figured we could be entertained AND eat for cheap.\n \nNeither one of is drinks alcohol on any regular basis so cocktails were not in the mix so thererefore cannot comment on prices. \n\nWe started our night with about a 15 min wait for a table - which really wasn't so bad.  The staff seemed friendly so I will give them a + in that department aside from the fact that our waitress was a bit peeved that I only ordered water with lemon.  As someone who tries to pay attention to the calories that I put into my body - I don't normally drink soda or juice and I'm sorry but I'm not paying $2.75 or $2.95 for water that had a Lipton tea bag in it .  There are a lot of things that I spend a lot of money on but I'm not going to be ripped off when I don't even want the item.  Had she not been peeved - she would have gotten our standard 20-25% tip. \n\nAs far as food - we ordered an antipasto app - I think it was about $11.95.  It was decently sized and had a good amount of taste but I think I'm just spoiled coming from back east.  I'm used a really hearty platter when I get an antipasto.  I am also looking for more meat and cheese in Vegas and it seems no one gets it right. In addition to the antipasto - we ordered a 12\" meat lovers pizza.  It too was tasty and I will say that it was MUCH tastier than Grimaldi's (who everyone raves about) but seriously - damn near $20 for a 12 inch pizza and $30 for a large .. You have to be joking.  There is no way in hell that I would EVER pay $30 for 16 inch pizza - I don't care what's on it. \n\nSo - all in all - for a tourist walking thru the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay dying for pizza - more power to you.  For a local - don't waste your money.  There are plenty of places in town with mediocre pizza for less money."

There was plenty for us both and it was about $18.50. Pretty steep, but it was great. My stomach kind of hurt after, but thats because I don't eat pizza very much. I would go back."

Slice offers, pizza's, pasta, sandwiches, salads and burgers.  We tried a burger and a Philly cheese steak sammie.  Both entree's came with choice of sweet potato or regular fries.  We both got sweet potato fries and the portions were huge!  Both of our sammies were well cooked big and flavorful not to mention the prices were considerably cheaper than Burger Bar.  \n\nOne cool item we noticed was the big glass beer taps you can order and have placed on your table or in front of you at the bar.  Basically at least a yard size glass tube with its own tap on the bottom so you can pour your own glass, totally cool.\n\nI strongly recommend trying this place if your stuck in Mandalay and want to eat some place good but still affordable."

I actually had lunch @ Julian Serrano Tapas at the Aria about 1.5 hrs before coming here, so I was already full.  \n\nThe GF remembered this place while wandering from Mandalay Bay to Luxor the previous time we were in Vegas.  It was already closed by the time we wandered through, but she had bookmarked this spot for dinner next time out.\n\nWell, we finally made it back and we came over here from the Vdara.  We actually arrived at 5:30pm so we hit happy hour, which is 1/2 off select booze and select appetizers, as well as individual slices.  This included vegan versions of some of the apps, which was great.\n\nI ended up ordering Not Your Mamma's Garlic Bread and Sweet Potato Fries tossed in truffle oil.  Since they were half off, why not get both?  \n\nThe Garlic Bread was fantastic...thick slices of bread and instead of butter and garlic, Slice of Vegas topped it with an almond based pesto that was quite tasty.  They served it with a side of a roast garlic bulb, which you could drop a knife into and grab a clove like it was butter.  That roast garlic but this over the top.\n\nThe Sweet Potato fries weren't anything special, but you could smell the truffle oil they tossed it in after.  It wasn't a huge amount, they probably drizzled it and gave it a few tosses, but it was plentiful as a whole and delicious.\n\nTheir pies were a little pricey; 12\" for $19.  I did try the crust on my GF's Vegan Buffalo Chicken pizza and it was cooked very well.  She loved it; but I didn't really taste the toppings itself so other than the crust, I can't comment on if it was good or not.  \n\nService was friendly and excellent.  The waitress was very patient. happy, and cheerful when assuring us that the ranch dip that came with the fries is vegan.\n\nI'm definitely coming back, but this time I'm going to order a pizza for myself or, if I hit happy hour again, get a slice."

I think the choices of the 10 different meats were misjudged. A lot of preserved and salty meat that made my pizza overall, pretty salty. I had to eat it with a side of ranch to get rid of the saltiness. I like that they made thin crust pizzas. For dessert, I got the cannolis, which I really liked! I was here around 6pm on a Friday and the place was 2/3 empty. The waiter was somehow pretty busy and we had difficulty catching his attention several times.

We called in advance to make a reservation for Friday at 7 o'clock; it was totally unnecessary. The restaurant was only half full. \n\nWe were first seated in booth overlooking the mall, but I became nauseated from the overpowering scents wafting over from Lush. They moved us without any trouble.\n\nWe asked to substitute beer for wine, but no go. House wine was the only option. Two pinot grigios were brought over. It was really sharp, way too much acidity.\n\nWe started with the tuscan salad ($10.95) Fresh spring mix, tossed with diced Roma tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, sliced red onion, basil, parsley and toasted chunks of herb \ninfused bread. Finished with an aged balsamic vinaigrette. And garlic fries ($6.95). The salad was nicely dressed and fresh only complaint was the lack of mozzarella cheese. The fries were shoestring and crisp, but pretty average. The garlic aioli was heavy; not a fan.\n\nNext we had the Margherita ($18.95) pizza and the rigatoni with meatballs and bologonese ($17.90). With a name like Slice of Vegas I had to try the Pizza. I wish I hadn't. The rigatoni was far superior. The margherita crust was tasteless and the ingredients lacked that high quality flavor. It was a real disappointment. The meatballs were ok, they tasted too bready to me, but the bolgonese sauce with the rigatoni was a real surprise. My husband and I both liked it.\n\nIf I were judging the pasta and salad on its own, I'd give an A-OK rating, but since the signature item is pizza.

Ordered the vegan pie, garlic pesto bread, garlic fries and chocolate cake with peanut butter icing on the lunch visit. \n\nLets start with Mama's garlic bread. Holy hell. This is probably the best garlic bread I have ever had. They give you a roasted head of garlic and the pesto on top is life changing. We ordered ours with Daiya as well. I just scooped out garlic (eventually resorting to squeezing every last drop of garlicky goodness from it's vessel) and spread it across the slices. It comes with four pieces of bread, so enough to share, if you are feeling generous. Well, everything we ate the portions were perfect for splitting.\n\nThen the garlic fries. I don't know what kind of magical mayo like basil dip they came with as well as ketchup and a generous heaping of diced garlic sprinkled over top, but it draws you to it like a moth to a flame. The fries are super thin and cooked to perfection. Not over salted as often is the case with fries.\n\nThe pie. We ordered the 12\" vegan pizza with diced eggplant, zucchini, roasted pepper and Daiya cheese. It too, perfectly seasoned and portioned.\n\nAfter all that, we still had room for the moist chocolate cake with whipped peanut butter frosting. Our slice was about 4 in. x 4 in. Atop a chocolate drizzled plate beside grapes rolled in sugar and a sprig of mint. It was nice to go from a well balanced and not overly sugary dessert to that little kick of wow. I have never once thought of doing that to grapes but it worked.\n\nFor my return dinner visit I ordered the vegan wings and more garlic, Daiya bread to go to eat on my return flight home. I was pleased to find I still got my roasted garlic in the box for the bread.\n\nThe wings were Gardein chicken strips with a sauce cup of buffalo sauce and one of ranch with carrot and celery sticks.  \n\nVegas is not a place I will be returning anytime soon but if I did, you better believe I would find my way back to this place. Much better than the Cantina a couple of doors down which also offers vegan options (3 star review to follow). I was also impressed our waitress Bianca, though not vegan herself and with us being her first vegan customers had been telling people that the cake was vegan after they'd eaten and raved about it. She said people often have stigmas about vegan food being disgusting and it's just not the case. :)"

I left mildly disappointed. \nThe service was brilliant, all of the TVs showing sports confused me (disclosure, we had been in Vegas for two days at this point, I'm from England, we normally have a maximum of one TV showing the news) and the pizza gave me mixed feelings. \nIn the UK I have never experienced a pizza that has a puddle of grease in the middle of it. This pizza tasted absolutely wonderful but you had to hold it up and let the grease drip off of it before attempting to eat it. The portions were also a lot larger than we had expected. Upon finishing both my partner and I felt rather unwell and we had to rush back to our hotel room, there was far too much grease on the pizza and that caused us to feel rather nauseous. \nAll in all three stars, after the excess grease had dropped off of the pizza there was a rather pleasant taste to it but after leaving us attached to the toilet for the remainder of the day we weren't too impressed."

            "review": "I've been to Slice of Vegas multiple times and for two reasons: 1) it's a convenient option to eat at right before a concert at HoB and 2) restaurant.com offers up a $25 off when you spend $37.50 certificate, making Slice easier on the wallet. \n\nHere's what I've had most recently:\n\nPASTA FAGIOLI SOUP ($4.95): Progresso's canned vegetarian minestrone soup packs more flavor than what Slice of Vegas is serving up. I added Parmesan cheese, pepper, and salt to my petite bowl of soup to no avail. There simply was no saving this soup. 1/5\n\nMEATLESS MEATBALL SUB ($13.95): Dripping with marinara, the sub was falling apart before my first bite. I'm already a messy eater- I don't need help. Meatballs were tasty though. 3/5\nPRO TIP: You get to add a flavor (such as garlic-rosemary) to your fries at no cost! Fries were on point.\n\n ZEPPOLI ($7.95): Truthfully, I enjoyed Olive Garden's Zeppoli better. The dough was thick and super chewy, giving my jaw a workout. The added Cinnamon was an unexpected flavor, but the zeppoli just failed to deliver. 2/5\n\nPRICE: On our last visit, dinner for two (even with 2 draft beers) came to $13 pre-tip after the restaurant.com gift certificate. 5/5, especially for the Strip!\n\nAMBIANCE: It's usually noisy here, especially when you're seated towards the back of the restaurant. Decor sticks to a red and black palette and the restaurant has fun fixtures on the wall (like a bike!). Music goes between country and low-key rock. 4/5\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: Average. 3.5/5\n\nPROS: Vegan Menu and affordability\nCONS: No bathroom in the restaurant, mostly underwhelming food\n\nReturn Visit?\nFor now, I've had my fill of Slice of Vegas. The only thing that has impressed me are the fries.\n\nYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #29"

The Caesar salad was pretty standard, but I enjoyed the parmesan crisps that were in the salad that was a nice touch. Their pizza won't blow you away, but it's a  solid choice for your pizza craving. \n\nService wise -- our waitress was pretty lackluster. She was friendly -- however didn't provide great service.

The chicken was truly disgusting--low quality, not marrinated, unseasoned, undercooked and definitely wasn't grilled, perhaps boiled or pan cooked. I found it inedible. Once I removed the chicken, the pizza was pretty good. Sat ten minutes at the table after we finished our food (empty drinks also) and we finally had to flag down our waitress for the bill"

When he did finally appear he brought my wife the wrong order and then had his thumb in her pasta when he finally brought the right order out. Later he took her Diet Coke for a refill and brought back an iced tea.

Staggering back to my room at the Luxor, from my friends room at Mandalay Bay, I passed by Slice of Vegas, and was drawn in, if by nothing but the fact it would be quick and to go. There was no one in line. I placed my order, as did about 10 people that lined up behind me. It wasn't until all 10 had been placed that cashier started to dish out slices from the case which I had until this point figured had been for display only. I mean why else would it have not been served as soon as I ordered it? About 20 minutes later, everyone's orders placed she began throwing the slices out. my room was a brisk 3 minute walk away, and by the time I arrived the slice was cold. It didnt even look appetizing. Didnt taste any better than it looked. It had that concession stand pizza taste, only older.\n\nMuch better options for a quick bite to eat, maybe you have to get the whole pie to not have a horrid experience?"

We made a reservation on yelp and were seated promptly. \n\n  Our server, Johanna was very helpful. We had a restaurant.com coupon (yes, check them out because they are on there)! She informed us of what we needed to spend ($37.50) and went on to take our drink order. My boyfriend ordered the absolute gimlet (it sounded good, but it wasn't) and we had to send it back. We offered to pay for it, but Johanna had no problem replacing it. We decided to play it safe and just order a bottle of Pinot noir. Their wine prices on bottles are fair and they carry some very drinkable brands;) \n\n  The food... Oh my gosh! We ordered off the vegan menu (yes I said menu)! We opted for the almond pesto cauliflower, truffle sweet potato fries, and a vegan veggie pizza. Everything came out pretty quickly. Seasoned to perfection and generous portion sizes, everything tasted amazing. I can honestly say I can't find one thing to complain about. Their vegan dessert menu looked great (vegan zeppollis! Chocolates cake with pnb frosting!! Ny cheesecake!!!) but we just couldn't fit anything in. We figure it's just another very good excuse to come\nBack. \n\n  They have a happy hour mon-thurs from 3-6pm. Apps are half off and we were informed that their house wines were cheaper than a soda!

Found a groupon for this joint. It's in Mandalay place, nice location. (It's always fun to stare at Pete Rose sitting at an empty autograph table).\nAt the podium we were quoted a ten minute wait, which was exactly how long it took. Seated at a crappy corner table, then I asked to move to a slightly less crappy corner table. Oh well.\nThey have a very nice beer selection. Great microbrews including my favorite beer ever brewed, New Belgium's 'La Folie.' Try it if you dare: a sour brown ale aged in merlot casks. Very well babanced, perfect use of Brettanomyces and tannin. Whoooohooo.\nThe people next to us had a gigantic pepperoni pizza on the table.  It looked alright, a little soggy for my taste. I also saw some spaghetti and red sauce dishes that appeared to be nothing spactacular.\nSarie ordered a cup of coffee and we relaxed a minute. The menu looked good, we decided to share a 'panini'... We ordered the proscuitto and brie. \"That sandwich is no longer on the menu\" our server tells us. What are you talking about, I think to myself, it's printed right there, stupid. Obviously it's on the menu. How about saying something like 'Oh, i'm very sorry, we're out of that one. maybe you'd like the _____ instead.' But I said Ok, we'll take the meatball sub.  \nBig mistake. \nFirst of all, it had very marginal flavor. The 'meatball' was more like a mushy sausage patty than a meatball. The red sauce was equally flavorless and I only knew it has cheese because I could see it. No taste there either.  AND it was certainly not a panini, which should be pressed and grilled. This was more like a toasted sandwich. Im sure Quiznos has a better one, anyway. \nThe garlic fries would have been wonderful if they were not served cold. 80 degrees is perfect for San Diego, not frenchies. I would have sent for some fresh ones, but our server might as well have been David Copperfield's sister, as good as she was at vanishing. We got the bill, and I was surprised to see that Sarie's cup of coffee cost about as much as a footlong meatball sub at Subway (which is where we should have gone in the first place).\nStarted feeling sick on the way home (although that might've been due to last night's festivities, which included copious amounts of liquid courage and about 65 cubic yards of mentholated smoke).\nOh, and the groupon isn't even good until tomorrow, so now I'll have to go back, although I really don't want to. But when I do, it'll be for 2 bottles of La Folie and some hot garlic fries.\nAll in all, this was a terrible way to spend $20 and an hour of our time. Blah food, blah service, blah blah blah. I'm giving it 2 stars only because of the great beer list and clean atmosphere.\nThanks you guys. Always a pleasure telling you how it is."

I took off one star because it is quite pricey for a pizza joint, which I'm sure is because everything is expensive in Vegas."

I am sure that if I ordered a whole pizza it would have been fantastic, because this warmed over pizza was good. Will go back if I'm in that mall again, but I'm not going to make the journey to walk through the casino for this pizza."

So I stopped in and sat at the bar...the place wasn't empty so that was a good sign, then again it was Football Sunday lol. Anyway I  sat down at the bar and someone had the Buffalo Chicken Pizza that really looked good. I asked how was it and she said excellent. I ordered the Margherita Pizza and it was awesome. This place style of crust is very unique and crispy. The bartender was outstanding and attentive.  The atmosphere was great. I highly recommend and I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas!!! Btw they had other good looking options to decide from on their menu if Pizza is not a must."

            "review": "Decent, for \"NY style\" pizza this far away from NY. Slice is in the Shops of Mandalay Bay (the connector mall between Mandalay and Luxor) and next door to Burger Bar. Generally, I'd say if you're trying to decide where to eat Burger Bar is way better but I had lunch there recently and wanted something different. \n\nThe interior is nice enough, with mostly booth style seating that should accommodate groups well. For once the person seating me didn't ask \"oh, just one? Do you want to sit at the bar?\" which was nice, because no I do not want to sit at the bar. The menu is your standard Italian offering - lasagna, build your own pasta and pizza. Because it's called \"Slice\" and not \"Pasta\" I had pizza.\n\nFirst, the crust is really good - nice and crisp with a little chew. I'll agree with a few other reviewers that their sauce is pretty bland - it's just lacking in flavor, period so plan to use the shakers of oregano and hot peppers. Overall, it wasn't as good as the slice I had at Sal's in NY but it was better than the garbage at Famous Original Ray's so a-ok.\n\nService was a-ok too. My food came quickly but I wasn't checked on after - the standard \"single diner\" treatment again....."

This place is awesome.\nThey have a great happy hour, great beer on tap, great beer in bottles, and daily specials. Our stone IPAs were only $4! SO we each had two and ordered \"not your jams garlic bread\". just needed something small before the show-It was incredible! Garlic bread covered in pesto served with a head of roasted garlic! SO delicious! I would come in here every time before shows, and maybe even make special trips!  (I don't live near the strip, in fact I hate the strip.)"

Which is always a good thing at any restaurant. \n\nThey had a Sunday brunch special, so my husband and I really wanted breakfast food because for those two days in Vegas we were NOT able to get up early for breakfast, must be the Alcohol! \n\nWe order steak hash, pieces of steak toss with season potato in a skillet topped with two over easy eggs and served with toast. This was really good and the steak wasn't chewy and nasty. Seasoned potato, good. \n\nWe figure that since this place is called Slice of Vegas, we should try their pizza, 12 inch pepperoni. Pizza was pack with flavor BUT the pepperoni was salty and made the pizza really greasy. We had to ask for napkins to daub the grease off. The grease turned me off, it made the pizza soggy because of the grease. Ugh."

As a past customer I feel so let down. They should at least offer some type of vegan pizza late at night same as the rest of the pizza styles. And no offer to have a pizza made either. I think that's whack costumer service. Again....feeling let down. :("

The noodles were DRENCHED in oil, it was kinda gross. This is the only time I have never liked pesto sauce!!\n\nI ordered the blue cheese burger with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were yummy and the burger was alright. The meat was kind of dry but all the other addings made it a pretty tasty burger.\n\nThe one cool thing here though is the big glass beer taps you can order and have placed on your table! It is a glass tube that's probably yard size with its own tap on the bottom so you can pour your own glass. Very awesome if you want some beer to go with your pizza or burger!\n\nI'd really only eat here if I was staying in the Mandalay Bay and wanted to eat somewhere convenient. Otherwise, it's kind of pricy for the quality but they do give you huge portions! However, they're not to die for leftovers. There is no 'wow' factor with the food here but it's decent Italian food for a decent price. There's soo much better in Vegas though. If you're only here for the weekend, I'd try something else!"

            "review": "There seems to be some sort of hype around Las Vegas pizza joints this month, Slice of Vegas included, so my Mom and I decided to try this one out.\n\nThere was a small wait when we arrived because the place was actually pretty busy, which in my book is usually a good sign. My mom can't eat dairy products due to a food allergy, so she was asking the manager if they had a Vegan cheese they could put on the pizza. The manager actually went to the kitchen and came back with a piece of what she called \"tease\" cheese for my mom to try to see if she liked the taste before she ordered a pizza covered in it. Mom claimed it was the best Vegan cheese she has ever tasted.\n\nWe were seated and the waiter came up right away and took our drink and food order. He was a nice guy, but it was so busy that he forgot the drinks, so we flagged down another waiter to bring them for us. \n\nWe ordered a 10-meat pizza and a dish of Pappardale pasta with spicy marinara sauce. Both of the items we ordered were excellent! The pizza had a nice thin crust and wasn't overloaded with toppings to the point where you couldn't pick it up...it was perfect! Plus, they made half of the pizza with the vegan \"tease\" cheese and the other half with Mozzarella, so Mom and I could both enjoy it :) The pasta had a great flavor as well, and though it wasn't the best pasta I've ever had, it was pretty damn good.\n\nTo top it off, I had a cannoli for dessert, which was just about average :)\n\nMy major gripe with this place is the SUPER inflated prices. I understand that we're on the Strip and everything is more expensive, but $18.95 for a 12-inch pizza is pretty outrageous. The pasta dish was $14.95 and the cannoli was $6.95. Way too pricey, although the food was good and the staff were extremely nice...especially the manager!"
