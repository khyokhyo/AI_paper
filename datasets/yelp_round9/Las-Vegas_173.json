            "review": "Having stayed in the monster casinos, I now really like and choose Hooters. Not for the Hooters and the Wings, for the fabulous convenience. The Hotel is so inexpensive, and still clean and well kept. It is worn a bit, however the maintenance and upkeep is fine, just fine. It is easy to get in and out. I can self park and be less that 50 feet from the elevator and once inside it is a quick turn to the hotel rooms elevator. Unlike the giant casinos where you MUST walk and extra mile through a maze of a casino on every entrance and exit! This is so wonderful to have convenience. Next i can walk across the street and get on the LV monorail and presto I am at the convention center and it is a simple down the escalator and I am in the south hall. Fabulous! So for me as a convention goer this is my favorite choice. A block off the strip and with my monorail pass. the strip is right there and no car to drag along or try to find later. And it is next door to the airport for those who fly in!"

I had the 3 egg omelette and it was 'fine'.\n\nStaff are friendly and accommodating with special requests - so they are the reason for my high rating.  I wont be back here, even just for laughs."

I was in town a night earlier before the rest of my group came to vegas and it didn't seem worth paying up for a nice hotel room when I was all by myself. This room only cost me $20 bucks and met expectations -- clean, comfortable bed; room was in good condition; not scary.\n\nWould I stay here every time I came to Vegas? Probably not.\n\nWould I recommend it to someone who just needed a cheap room for one night in order to collapse? Absolutely."

            "review": "This hotel was chosen for it's price tag. But I would NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!!  I would rather sleep in a rental car.\n\nThe hotel is very run down. Maintenance is in over their heads and housekeeping seems to overlook even the most obvious details of cleaning a room.\n\nIn order to open the jammed door to our room, you had to lift up and push. The door had broken pieces and dents near the door knob, which makes me believe someone attempted to break into that room at one point. Management apparently doesn't deem this a necessary fix.\nThe bathtub was filthy... Nothing a good scrubbing couldn't fix, but it had a ring around it... As if housekeeping repeatedly bypassed scrubbing the bathtub. It's the first bathroom I refused to use due to uncleanliness. The floor was sticky like it had been mopped with a dirty mop, so I chose to keep my shoes on.\nMy \"non-smoking\" room was DEFINITELY smoked in and it smelled moist and musky.\n\nThe TV didn't work, but maintenance came and brought us a new cable to get it working again. Someone had stolen the cable to the TV.\nThe walls are thin.\nBUT THE VERY WORST PART:\nMy partner woke up in the middle of the night with a sudden breakout/reaction on both of his eyes.  The DIRTY BEDDING caused this. We left immediately and did not even finish our nights stay. After leaving it cleared up very quickly. He hadn't suffered from a reaction like that since he was a child. But because of past experience, he knew it was an allergic reaction to all the dust and smoke in the room.\nWe were offered another room but not a refund.\n\nI recommend going next door to the Howard Johnson on Tropicana!!!  The rooms are dated but ALWAYS clean and never smell like smoke!!! Not to mention, the price tag is also cheap so you have more money for other things!"

I also chilled with these british guys and they were hitting on my server lol...... Id go back and mabe even play blackjack there."

The last trip we stayed at the Tropicana, quite the nightmare, but nothing compared to the ABSOLUTE SHITHOLE that is Hooters Hotel and Casino.  \nThe elevators don't work most of the time.  The A/C never works in the hallway.  The place smells of mold, ass and old cigar smoke.  The rooms are on the smaller side and make sure you stay away from the bar stools in the corner as they are a death trap waiting to happen.  Just trust me on this one.  The rooms are also dirty, especially the bathroom.  My favorite are the little notes around the room.....\n\nNote #1 - We are trying to conserve power and energy, therefore, we would really appreciate it if you would use the same towel twice before we replace them.  (WHAT?!?!??  That's just gross, maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I didn't find blond hairs all over the bathroom.  By the way, those of us in this room all have dark hair.  Black more specifically)\n\nDid I mention the three tempature escalating shower I was introduced too.  Nice, Cold, HOTT!!  Nice, COLD, HOTTTT!!  and so on.....\n\nNote #2 - Again we are trying to conserve power and energy and would rather not change the sheets on every visit.  Face it, you don't change the sheets at YOUR house everyday, do you?  (Well no, but I also don't have left over blood stains on my comforter either)\n\nI understand the saving energy thing, but not in vegas, we are at a casino for fucksake.  Lights on and blinking 24 hours a day, yeah, way to save Hooters!!\n\nThe food, well, disgusting, but it's Hooters what more could you ask for.\n\nJust a side note, I learned at Hooters that the gals, in the black shorts with their Hooters uniforms are the pregnant ones....I've never seen so many pregnant Hooters bitches in my life.  I just don't know how I feel about that.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I still give Hooters two stars for the $800 I won gambling, (did I mention I'm not a gambler) and the bartender \"Guy\" at the bar to the left when you walk in.  He was an awesome guy and a great bartender!!\n\nThe best part of all, was knowing I only had to stay two nights, because my last two nights would be spent in a suite at the Venetian!!"

My boyfriend stayed here 8 years ago and raved about how nice it was, within five minutes of being there I heard him saying \"this sure isn't what it used to be!\" I guess it really went downhill. The dealers were very unprofessional, especially at the craps tables. Everything was kind of run down. I went back to the bar to order some famous wings to take back to the hotel so I could get us out of there. The bartenders were as bad as the dealers, I saw my order sitting on the counter for at least 10 minutes before he finally gave them to me and I had already paid. It was irritating! The wings tasted really good and were the only good part of our experience at hooters (probably because we got the wings to go!) Skip this place, there's a ton of other options close by!"

            "review": "If you have experienced other Las Vegas Hotels, then yes walking down the hall at Hooters makes you feel like you're in a frat house, but the rooms really weren't that bad for the price.\n\nLet's be real, most people come to Vegas, or stay at cheap hotels on the Strip because they are doing one thing: Getting so wasted they can't function. I think this Hotel is made for that. \n\nI have stayed in cheap rooms here and was always happy. Here's the pros and cons:\n\n-Clean cheap rooms\n-Great view of the Strip\n-Horrible parking garage\n-Casino and Hotel aren't that big so you don't have to walk far in those heels to get back to the elevator.\n-No much to eat (See Mad Onion review).\n-Close enough to other Hotels so you can bounce around\n-Girls aren't the greatest looking. I expected better from Hooters\n-Casino floor staff are annoying as hell! While playing a slot machine I was ID ed about 10 times. \n-Purple Reign. Love\n\nIn my opinion this place gets the job done as far as I'm concerned. So if you're looking for a place on the Strip to crash check out their rates."

            "review": "Oh Hooters. Got love them right? I stayed here for my 21st birthday because it has the best deal on i4vegas.com. There are good things about this hotel and there are crappy things about this hotel. \n\nI will start with the negatives only because the positives may or may not out weigh the negatives and I kind of like leaving people with a happy note. \n\nSo, first of all, if you stay there and you park in the parking garage, be careful. The garage itself contains creepy people and I may have seen a security guard on his little bike once just riding around not really looking. Also, the elevators that lead from the parking garage to the hotel are probably the scariest elevators I have ever been in. They are old and rickety looking/sounding, I was like \"We are going to die in here, just saying,\" I was a little nervous cause I was not about to get stuck in an elevator before having a drink first. \n\nSitting at the bars were not all that great, the staff at the time were not very chatty with people. It was more like, \"What do you want and tell me now or I will keep ignoring you.\" So, I stayed clear from the bars there. I just figured the alcohol in my room would suffice. \n\nThe hotel portion was nice and all, but I can see why I got a good deal for the rooms. If your looking for class, this is not the place. However, the beds were comfy! I loved sleeping there. Orange lamps were kind of cool too. \n\nNow to leave you with some positivity. The restaurant itself was pretty cool. They were able to accommodate my group of people in a quick time too. I saw tons of people there and we were seated pretty quick. The food is always great to me. I use to go to the one in Ontario and will always love Hooters food. The ladies were nice as well. My waitress was hilarious so it made for a good night. \n\nThe Mad Onion restaurant was really good as well. We ate there twice, dinner and breakfast and I loved it all. They were open late nights and it was pretty cheap. I think prime rib was around $10. They also do a champagne brunch deal too. Love me some champagne with my waffles. \n\nFinally, I will say that if you have heard of the Men of X show, please laugh with me. I have seen Thunder Down Under before and I thought the Men of X show would be like it and their tickets were only $16 and not $45. So I let my mom talk me into it. It is only 4 dudes, who pretty much just dance their booties off. I laughed so hard during the whole thing, just because it was so cheesy! I think if you want a good laugh $16 bucks is pretty good. \n\nHope that helps those who want a cheapish place to stay or eat."

            "review": "I'm giving this a 1-star rating and maybe they deserve better.  I was just so turned off with what happened to me at check-in.\n\nI stayed at Hooters a couple weeks ago...booked online with what I thought was a great deal.  Booked directly from their website, because I didn't want to deal with any weird hidden fees from a third-party site like Hotwire, Orbitz, etc.  Went through the process...clicked my dates, saw the rates, saw the taxes and resorts fees...no problem!  Then I saw that they offered an additional AAA discount, so i was feeling pretty good!  Then when I got there and checked in they said they had already applied the AAA discount.  Not sure how that was possible.  I never inputted any code or anything, so how did they know I had a AAA membership?  The site says they offer a AAA discount when you show proof at check in.  So I tried to explain to two females (one said she was a manager) the situation and they looked at me like I had 25 heads.  They insisted the discount was already applied to my rate when I booked.  I insisted it wasn't (because that was the truth)!  I understand things get messed up, but their behavior toward me was ridiculous.  At first they were very nice, then when I politely explained they were wrong, they both got very defensive and tried to make me feel like an idiot.  Then I got a little upset because a) i was right b) they were wrong c) they insisted I was wrong and d) they were rude.  \n\nThe rest of my stay was fine...decent room for the price, not a far walk to The Strip, cheap tables, etc, etc.  \n\nHowever, I'm big on customer service and this place has NONE.  Never going back there.  Oh one other thing, they said there's wireless Internet...Not in my room.  You're barely in the room in Vegas, so not a huge deal I guess.  Just more lack of customer service."

The girls are not meant to be swimsuit models, otherwise they wouldn't be working at Hooters.  The point is, if you are going somewhere to drink beer and eat wings, you may as well have a girl with big hoo-hoos serving you.  She doesn't have to be a 10 for her to make it a more pleasant experience than getting beer and wings from some hurting girl somewhere else.\n\nSo get over it, stop with the criticisms and enjoy yourself.\n\nWings = good and cheap.\nHam & cheese sandwich - surprisingly edible.\nBeer - same as everywhere else.\nBoobs - well above average.  Plus the view of the pool patrons while you are eating is a plus.\n\nI knocked off one star because the bartender was way too full of herself and wouldn't even smile while serving drinks.  She might be a Hooter-hater too.  If you're too full of yourself to work there, get the hell out."

We said to ourselves \"why not wander over there\" (second mistake).  \n\nThe casino itself was OK; machines were alright, the building itself looks like it has been around a while, and cocktail waitresses were non existent even on Memorial Day weekend. I won't be back for the casino. \n\nThe really bad part of this place is the restaurant. I had very low expectations and the restaurant failed to meet even them. I'm not sure why we decided to eat here, with so many better options. I think it was proximity. Or being too tired to walk farther. Either way eating there was our third mistake. \n\nFirst we were seated on rickety stools. And then we were completely ignored by our waitress. It wasn't even busy. It took thirty plus minutes to get a drink.  At least 45 additional minutes to get our food, after a long wait just to place our order. And then when the food did arrive, it was cold. Not just \"not warm\" but cold. The wings that were supposed to be \"medium\" lacked any visible sauce and had zero flavor. The salad had wilted lettuce, and even a few bits of mold. It was inedible. We sent it back and the waitress barely blinked - it's obviously a common occurrence. \n\nLong story short:  never again."

Go to the concert and head back to California early Sunday morning. Instead of paying $300+ to stay at one of the major casinos I decided to give the $50 Hooters room a shot. Overall, the room was clean, cheap, and close enough to the strip that a cab ride to Mandalay Bay was only $9. Good Hotel if you're looking for a decent, cheap place to stay."

FROM MANAGEMENT (ROBERT TROWBRIDGE,FOOD & BEVERAGE GENERAL MANAGER) TO FRONT DESK SUPERVISOR, LILLY, none of them were SKILLED ENOUGH to provide solutions to all of the issues we had!!! Starting with our booking issues, we were their waiting for our paperwork to proceed. Luckily,we got MARIAH at the front desk who was kind enough to go far and beyond to fix others mistakes! Once we finally made it to our room on the 9th floor, THE NON SMOKING ROOM SMELLED LIKE A SMOKING ROOM!!! We stepped out for a bit,only to come back,and have KEYS THAT DID NOT WORK TO OPEN DOOR!! Are you kidding me,this is ONLY DAY ONE!!! On DAY 2,we placed the room service request sign as we left, only to walk into the SAME CONDITION we left it in,I GUESS HOUSE-SKEEPING SKIPPED OUR ROOM! All bad! Being that we had teenagers with us,we decided to stay in,order food and watch one of the OVER-PRICED MOVIE,but we couldnt, BECAUSE SOMEHOW THERE WAS A BLOCK FROM THE FRONT DESK THAT THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO REMOVE! We picked up the house phone to call for help,BUT THERE WERE NO DIAL BUTTONS ON THE PHONE!! What the hell?? I wasn't aware of the BROKEN PHONE when we PAID $563.00 A NIGHT FOR THIS ROOM!! All bad! I decided to walk downstairs to Hooters ro ask for some paper plates,and one of their pretty waiters was VERY RUDE in even answering my question, so I helped myself to the to-go containers since she was clear that she was too busy to help me with something so simple! We did get some help with the movie issue, a ENGINEER was sent up to our room to figure out what was wrong,oh wait,but he didn't even know what he was doing,I'm not sure why the technician would be the one called for this situation! Sadly,at this point, the kids gave up on trying to watch a movie! Randomly, house-keeping WALKED INTO OUR ROOM,WITHOUT KNOCKING,good thing we were all dressed because I have no idea why they would come into our room!! I can't EXPRESS THE DISSAPPOINMENT building up!!! To top off the WORSE STAY AT HOOTERS HOTEL, all of us were WOKEN UP BY A KNOCK AT 5:30 AM FROM THE ENGINEER TRYING TO FIX THE A/C,um,the A/C was probably the only thing working in this room,so no,nobody called for that,but since you already woke us up,maybe fixing the TOILET THAT DIDN'T FLUSH would be worth waking us up!! Oh did I forget to mention the part where we physically handed the tip to the room service runner,but he TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO STILL CHARGE A TIP TO THE CREDIT CARD ON FILE!! I CAN'T COMPREHEND why he would freely swipe our card when I handed him cash for the tip! I don't get it. To end this whole messy fiasco, the only 2 THINGS THEY GOT RIGHT WAS BRINGING OR LUGGAGE DOWNSTAIRS AND THE VALET PULLING UP OUR CAR! Prior to checking out,I requested (As one of the adults) to speak with the hotel manager to figure out how there can be so many AVOIDABLE ISSUES in one weekend,but apparently Donovan (Female manager) wasn't available, coincidently, to speak with me!! I felt the NEED to express this ABSURD EXPERIENCE with others to avoid a HEADACHE AND WASTE OF MONEY!!!We honestly tried making the best out every challenge, and we did,but THE STAFF NEEDS HELP MAN!!!! UGLY ENVIRONMENT DIRTY POOL, LACK OF PRINCIPLE VALUES TO GUEST, WORDS DON'T DO US JUSTICE FOR WHAT WE WENT THROUGH!"

The hotel is nothing like the pics you will see on their web site, I'm sure they are photo shopped to hide the dirt and add in furniture that you wont find. The pool pics might be from when the hotel opened about 15 yrs ago, the pool is a disappointment. \nJust two stars. The hotel is old and dated. A frig was an extra $25 buck a night, so that puts you in a much better hotel for $25 buck more. What is up with the stupid resort fees? where was the resort? another location?.\n All I can say is they need to become familiar with the following definition:\n\nmain\u00b7te\u00b7nance\nm\u0101nt()nns,m\u0101ntn-ns/\nnoun\nnoun: maintenance\n1. the process of maintaining or preserving someone or something, or the state of being maintained.\n\nThe staff are polite and when they knew, helpful. Too many staff did not know answers to how the club cards work, how to play points, or cash in on comps. \nThe pool area is 24/7. STOP THAT! Clean it UP!\nNow food was good, for the type of food, bar food. \nTheir $10.99 Prime Rib was very good.\nSo Staff good, but not up on things, food acceptable, pool and hotel a fail.\n\nI recommend you spend some more money on a room somewhere else."

We booked our weekend (Sat & Sun nights) online for NY NY but I screwed up and booked Sun & Mon and noticed in time to cancel, and changing to Sat & Sun was so much more expensive, and we had plans that would be keeping up pretty busy the whole time, so we decided to skimp on the hotel this time.  \n\nMy feeling is that it's just a bed, so I can spend my time where ever i want, and crash out in the hotel, who cares if it's not the best hotel?  But, that's not totally true.  I do like a nice, high end hotel.  This just was not the weekend to do that.  Last time we were in Vegas in Sept, we stayed at the Delano Towers.  Hooters is the polar opposite of The Delano Towers.\n\nThe hotel is old, it's decorated just like a Hooters restaurant.  Lots of pine paneling, tacky orange and brown stuff everywhere.  The hotel is the brick and mortar version of the Hooter Girls uniforms.  Old school, tacky, cheap....yet fun.  \n\nOur room was not anything special, but it was clean.  It was old and the whole place needs a major overhaul, but it wasn't like the worst place in the world. \n\nWe spent some time at the Hooters bar on Sat night after getting in from the UNLV game, that was pretty fun.  Trey was the bartender and kept us entertained.  \n\nI am not sure if we will stay here again.  It's off the strip, but that is convenient for us since we have a fair amount of activities that involve visiting my bf's daughter who is a UNLV rebel girl, so we go out to the football stadium, etc, so being off strip is actually better for us.  It's not that far from the strip, anyways."

I realized I had left my iphone charger in the room. I called the hotel immediately and requested that they send it back to me (southern California). It has been almost 3 weeks now and I have not yet received my charger. When I called the first time, I had transfer after transfer on the phone. No body could tell me when I would get my charger back. I even spoke to the hotel manager once or twice and she promised me I would get it in the mail the follow friday. No charger. So warning to everyone do not leave items behind. They dont know how to give it back!"

First off, got tickets from expedia for $65 a night.\nCasino itself has been a little redone since when it used to be the San Remo.\nSo we get there at 1130pm, and at first they can't find out reservation. After 20 mins of the counter person being gone, looking in the back for our reservation, she comes back to say we'd have to wait another 45 mins for them to clean a room.\nSo we wait, and come back an hour later. Room is ready.. Good thing was we got upgraded to a tower room as opposed to a bungalow room.  Dont get me the wrong the room was nice and clean, nice beds, nice tv, etc etc.  Now the hall way to the room had seen some better days, and in a real need of a steam cleaning to get rid of all those dirty spots.. Otherwise, the casino itself, was pretty nice.\nOther thing that happened, was the next day after waking up from a drunken slumber at almost 2pm, we left at around 3pm to meet up with some friends, and called room service to have the room picked up and cleaned by the time we got back.\nWell we get back, and nothing had been done to the room. Luckily I ain't no slob, so I didnt make a fuss, and wiped my arse with the same towels from night before....LOL... OH well i figured, since we got upgraded to the towers...  I should have complained though, since they automatically add almost $9 dollars a  night for that service... Oh, and I figured, hell, lets get some wings sent up via room service.. So i call, and call, and call, and no one answers...oh, well I guess they dont want my money..fail on the wings...\nWould I stay here again....maybe.  I did like the fact it wasnt directly on the strip, and during the day, the casino or pool weren't super packed like all the other casinos."

It was hypnotic, and there is a strong possibility that the sign may have even winked at me (or maybe that I just needed to get some more sleep).  So I got a couple of people to walk with me across the street on an adventure to the Hooters Casino. \n\nFrom the outside, it looks like an oversize Hooters.  On the inside, the casino is tiny and smaller than anything I have seen on the strip.  We were able to walk through the entire casino in less than a couple of minutes.  There wasn't very many people in the casino, and there seemed to be more employees than patrons on a Saturday night.  All of the dealers were Hooters girls, deck out in their white and orange gear.  The theme of Hooters was evident and well maintained throughout.\n\nWhen we got to the back of the Casino, I went into the store to check out what they had.  They had some cute Hooters branded cloths, and I found a jersey top that I liked to buy for my wife.  After that, we took a look out the back door of the casino to see the pool.  It was pretty sad.  There were just a bunch of dudes hanging out, and not a Hooter in sight.  The pool looked like a giant sized Motel 6 pool, and did not look like a fun place to hang out at all.  So we headed back inside towards the front of the Casino.  We passed two restaurants on the way.  One of them being a Hooters, of course.  When we got to the front there was another store that I did not notice when we first walked in.  This store had lots more cloths and Hooters paraphernalia, so I went in to check it out and ended up buying more stuff.  They had a special in the store that if you buy $35 of merchandise you get a free gift.  The clerk at the registered informed me that for a $1.50 I could buy a sacky bag.  I thought I was a $1.50 off of hitting the $35 mark and so I agreed to get the bag.  It turned out that the bag was another promotion, and that my free gift was actually a Hooters girl calendar...from 2010  :I\n\nAfter buying all of the cute Hooters gear for my wife to wear, we went on our way.  Now that she has all of these cloths I don't have to bother going to Hooters anymore to check out the girls in the itsy-bitsy outfits.  I look forward to Val making me a Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich in one of her new Hooters outfits, and I'm pretty sure I won't go to this casino again.  There really wasn't anything special to see or do here."

            "review": "I have had several experiences with this hotel.\n\nThe first was when the USA 7's International Rugby Tournament was in town and the opening night party was at the Hooter's pool. They did a good job of accommodating all of the wild partying. They even set up long tables for beer pong, flip cup and the like. Despite the freezing temperatures and the need to huddle under the outdoor heaters or in the hot tub, Hooter's did a good job keeping everyone happy.\n\nThe second experience was the next day when I went up to my friend's room (we were staying at the Motel 6 next door... see other review). I was expecting a trashy room with Hooter's orange all over the furniture. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious, clean and did not smell like too many bad nights. The dark oak furniture and modest bedding gave the room a much classier look than the hotel's name would suggest. \n\nFast forward 4 months when a friend and I booked a room at Hooter's for a 2-night stint in Sin City. We arrived mid-afternoon about an hour after check-in. We were checked into a room on a high floor with a partial mountain view and full pool view. After a long trek down the hallway to the very end, we couldn't get the key card to work. The lights on the door wouldn't even light up (red or green). We tried slow, fast, leaving it in, everything imaginable. \n\nFinally, I went down to the front desk and asked for a new card. Same problem. I went down again. New card. Same problem. My friend went down. New card. Same problem. Finally they sent a security guard up to help us. He tried our card and had the same problem (duh). Then several other guards showed up to help. So if you have ever wondered how many security guards it takes to open a hotel room door, the answer is 4. Our room key still didn't work so he finally tried his universal swipe card and gained access without a problem. He said that they have been having problems with this door all week. -Isn't that something? They knew the door didn't work but still decided to assign us to the room. - He then wished us well and started to leave. \"No, wait!\" I shouted from the bedroom area. I explained to him that we would still be locked out of our room without a working key card and door. We had no intention of staying in the room all weekend. We needed a working key. He seemed surprised like he hadn't thought of that. He said he would go down and take care of it. We hung out in the room and started getting ready for our night out as we were still in our comfy driving clothes. \n\nHe returned 20 minutes later with a luggage cart and new room keys for a different room. He asked us if smoking was okay and we reluctantly agreed after we were assured that the smoke smell isn't that bad. \n\nHe helped us haul our bags down to the new room and made sure the new keys worked. However, the room was practically dripping in cigarette stench. The whole ordeal had worn us out and the security guard was already going above and beyond his job description so we kept our mouths shut and thanked him.\n\nThey should have upgraded us to a suite for wasting our time and trying our patience but they insisted all of the suites were booked. I actually believe them because they only have a few. They are not a mega resort with entire floors full of suites.\n\nThe room was not as nice as the one my friend had been in despite the fact that it was the same rate level. Oh well, whatever. The shower was nice.\n\nWe finished getting ready and wandered down to the Hooter's restaurant. Not our first choice but after 5 hours in the car and 2 hours getting into the room. We were in town for my friend's birthday and the waitresses sang to her even though she asked that they didn't. Serves her right for even mentioning it. The server we had was the token pregnant Hooter's waitress. She was very nice and friendly. Her being pregnant and not trying to flaunt her sexuality (they even have special clothes for the preggo chicks) probably made her the best server because she focused on the customer instead of just exploiting tips from horny, drunk guys.\n\nAfter that we didn't do much in terms of using the hotel or casino. We went to other pools for our daytime lounging and other casinos to feed our addiction and other clubs to dance the night away. We slept and showered at Hooter's but that was about it.\n\nOh yeah, the parking garage is the best bet when parking although the elevators down to the casino are very dirty, smelly and frankly - just scary. The valet is very slow and definitely not worth the effort. You can stop in the valet station and no one will acknowledge you for 10 minutes. I swear. It has happened to me 3 times out of 3 attempts."

They serve wings 24/7 which is great. \n\nSo there are some great positives...\n1) The casino is small but because it is not huge the smoke is kept to a minimum and you arent walking through large clouds of smoke\n2) Their pool is very nicely organized and great for kids\n3)  $29 rooms are simple and affordable. No bells & whistles except for the coffee machine and TV. Which usually doesn't matter because all you do is sleep in them\n4) Free parking & Valet with room . You may not think this is important but it is huge.\n5) Just off the strip but close enough you can walk easily\n6) HOT showers\n\nSome meh's\n1) Despite being close to the airport you really cannot hear the airplanes so dont let that be a deterrent\n2) The room is like your college dorm. 4 Walls, a TV, beds and a desk. I had to ask 3 times for a chair to the desk. Do not expect a refrigerator and if you want one it will be $25/night. Considering we paid $29/night for the room, we just brought coolers and used their free ice. Saved a lot of time and money.\n3) Our beds had no bed bugs. yay!\n4) Thermostats were solid\n5) The TV is an old Zenith style..no HDMI for cheating on the laptop with movies\n\nFinally, of course, negatives...\n1) Free, albeit slow compared to what you are used to, WIFI\n2) Resort fee of $15/night NOT included in booking.com regardless of what booking said (this is for the wifi, parking)\n3) Not a lot of hang out options and no buffet option\n4) Cell service in the rooms is terrible. I was gonna cheat on the wifi by hooking up my cell to the lappy but it got worse coverage. Again you probably dont care since you wont be in the room too often\n5) DO NOT believe booking sites. We asked for a king bed and got 2 queens. \n\nHere is the real thing: it's $29/night .So if you are looking for an inexpensive place to crash and plan on doing things elsewhere, this is a good deal. If you are looking for the extras like a spa or resort you will be very disappointed. Great for kids..great for singles..terrible for the rich & famous."

After complying with their request, I did not want to stay another night, they refused to leave the front door when i told them I would leave right away because I needed to pack my belongings. After I had confirmed with the third employee that was in front of my door, I refused any additional charges due to miscommunication with their staff, informing a client(myself) wrong information I should not  be entitled to any charges. I was then charged additional fees several day later. As of this moment, the issue has not been resolved and they are not taking responsibility of their employees."

Then i headed to the card tables to try out some blackjack and was doing pretty good when i noticed a cocktail waitress and asked her for a drink because she was helping everyone else except me . she then asked me for my id with a stuck up attitude and said she would be back soon.20 minutes go by and still nothing, so i switched to a a different table with a different waitress. As i sat down to start playing a cocktail waitress wasn't paying attention and bumped right into me and spilled 2 beers all over my pants and then laughed and felt kind of stupid so i brushed it off and helped her pick up her mess. As i finish  helping her i asked her for a beer and she told me to take seat and play a hand and she would be right back. so she waits to confirm that I'm playing a hand and then sneaks over to her manager to give a description of how i looked and said i was to drunk and says to not give me anymore drinks (which was overheard by multiple witnesses).I then wait about 20 minutes and she's nowhere to be found..I was then approached and told by an eyewitness what was said after i left the table .I immediatley approached the manager that the waitress spoke to and i was told to go speak to the bar manager .As i go over to the bar manager i see the waitress and overhear her telling another waitress that some drunk guy came and knocked all of her drinks over as i walk up to her.I immediately become pissed the **** off and ask her for her name and her manger .She then brings me to the bar manager and he asks whats going on with a annoyed look on his face , i proceed to tell him whats going on and he cuts me off and rudely says \"what kind of outcome do you want from this\" , as the waitress walks by and says \"you can even ask everyone at the table what happened\" with a smirk on her face. I then ask for his manager and he brings me to the head night manager at the customer service booth.I then proceed to tell her what has happened, he then comes back from a 30 second walk and says to his manager that everyone at the table confirmed what she has said, (as i look at the table none of the players that i played with were there!!!!!).His manager then said that theres nothing she can do about it and the bar manger then said that maybe i should get a lawyer with a laugh and walks off!I immediately left there casino and will never return.not only that but i will be contacting a lawyer tomorrow morning to pursue the slanderous comments that were said by julian with a civil lawsuit . As you can tell I'm obviously not drunk but pissed the **** off and encourage everyone to go to any other casino except this one!"

            "review": "Where to begin. I've been coming to Hooters Hotel for years, my last visit having been a couple of years ago. I've never expected much from Hooters as it's always been a cheap but decent place to stay and play. Unfortunately in the last couple of years they've really let the place go. The rooms used to be a decent place to sleep, and unwind after a day of getting your butt kicked at craps. No longer. The rooms were absolutely disgusting. Missing chairs, filthy carpets with stains from God knows what on them, moldy bathrooms, rusting exposed pipes, fecal matter left in the \"clean toilets\", towels that were thread bear and reeked of unmentionable things (ie: they weren't well cleaned if at all). It was literally vomit inducing. \n\nThe common areas have not fared better in recent years with missing ceiling panels, failing air conditioning, elevators that are barely functional and reek of weed and urine. The Hooters restaurant in the back of the casino is still the same as always and is what you'd expect from a run of the mill Hooters, but unfortunately the fairly nice Dan Marino's restaurant up front has been replaced with \"The Mad Onion\" which is just best avoided. The staff are a miserable bunch who seem generally upset to be working there, and the food isn't even deserving of the name food. I had the turkey dinner and my companions had the brisket and mozzarella sticks respectively. Not one of the meals was even half finished. They were all barely edible. The McDonald's over at Excalibur would have been a classier and more palatable choice. \n\nThe only place it looks like they've spent any money lately is on the casino, unfortunately that too was wasted and not for the better. Most of the table games have been replaced with electronic counterparts which are just not enjoyable like \"old fashioned\" blackjack, roulette, etc... \n\nIt really pains me to say this as I've been a big fan of this casino and hotel for years and made it a point to stop by even if I'm not staying here on a particular trip. But after my most recent visit I will not be returning. They've really let this place go to the point where a Motel 6 looks like the Ritz by comparison."

I wanted something small to eat with my appetizer and was told the smallest thing I could order was a 10 piece of wings. I asked for a kids meal and the manager came at me aggressively, yelling and outrageously disrespectful. I was in shock. After he left, I told the bartender I was very uncomfortable with his behavior and told her to have him come back out. He refused but another manager did who was just as rude. I decided to leave and never come back again. I mean, they acted like I was a criminal trying to con them for asking for a kid's meal because I wanted a small amount of chicken to go with my appetizer. I am shocked that these guys are managers at any restaurant. They need to be nice because they need EVERY customer they can get. The place has been in financial turmoil for years. It's also very run down. I recommend going to the Hooters at the Palms instead. Let this place just close up."

Sat morning.. Called  for early check in 30$ lmao What????!!!! Ok.. Never mind we will float around until 3pm.\nSo we get to Hooters at 2:53 pm get a room on the 4th fl and as soon as we opened the door a bad smell of mildew hit us and with some having asthma and allergies this is a no no. Called for a manager we got the head of house keeping.. (1 st joke ) she said we just cleaned the carpet .. Huh? ok, we need a new room so we had to carry everything back down and wait back in line we get a lady name H (later found out she is the manager) she put us on the 18 Th floor said it was new carpet and new bed ? ( not sure about that but, we will take it )\nRoom  was ok . We leave to go out and long story short one friend went back to the room 3 of us stayed out, came back to the room around 1am got to the 18th fl and our key would not open the door we hear a lil noise ( thought someone was having adult time) didn't pay it any mind continued to try and get the door open and we hear yelling and screaming and some talking that was in Spanish and a door slam then stop, help, I can't take this anymore needles to say her man was beating the shit out of her .. We get scared thinking that maybe he would come out and see us trying to get in out room and start trouble with us so I'm trying to google the hotel for the number so I can call for help  and my friend got her phone and called our other friend that was in the room sleep. We get in call for help from our room .. They come about 10 min later ( maybe more 2nd joke ) I go out and tell them what happen and we are scared they say go back in the room they stand by the door to see if they hear anything and they started again the men was beating her .. Smh .. So they say open up he did and they say miss are you ok ( I didn't hear what was said but the two guys walked by our room as they left and said code 4 I guess that means clear problem over . 3rd joke) but at the end of it all no one from Hooters called our room and even asked if we would have liked to be moved. we all slept with one eye open and checked out at 730 that morning  this was the soonest we could. at this point we had enough and was just ready to go home . While checking out we could not get any type of refund ( because the manager H wasn't in till 2pm 4th joke)so I walk over to talk to the security ( because you have to go though them to make a complaint Hooters is private owned) while telling them the story one guy says was he BLACK HUH? What the fuck does that mean? Only black men beat women ? Smh (5th joke)but this really has to be a joke.) Ok ok it's really time to go , head of security knew nothing about this I wonder why.Please never stay here 100$ is not worth all the shit you will go though and after all of this my friend is still trying to get our money back . That's the least they can do right? As you can tell this hotel is full of jokes and bad management as well as crappy rooms.and they should have called the police. Very bad hotel beware"

Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed...\n\nReview #31:\nthis place will surprise no one; if you take Hooters, and build a casino around it, voila!; it sort of has a semi-beach-joint, Margaritaville-type vibe, but I suppose so does the restaurant chain sort-of/kind-of; there is actually 1 other dining option here, but get your damn ass into the great big Hooters (no pun intended) restaurant and order up some damn chicken wings!; overall, I was disappointed that there were not scantily-clad buxom servers everywhere in the casino, so set your expecations accordingly; this is definitely a low-to-midscale type of joint with not a heck of a lot to recommend it.  It should maybe get 2.5 stars, and I originally had rounded up for the sake of boobies everywhere, but upon reflection, I can't give this place more than 2 stars, considering the competition in Las Vegas; best craft beer bet = ha! it's Hooters, so at best it's a bottle of Sam Adams if you're lucky"

We rolled in on Saturday evening, with plenty of time to find a place to crash for the night. We weighed our options and decided our hotel of choice would need to fulfill three of the following key factors:\n\n*affordability\n*location \n*high percentage of cute girls\n\nAfter stopping at Barbary Coast, The Rio, and The Palms, I remembered my time working at Hooters Grand Avenue in Milwaukee, and we all realized there was a fairly new Hooters Casino that might just fit the bill. \n\nWell, it was affordable, at just $110 bucks on a Saturday night, and they didn't require a two-night minimum like some places do on a holiday weekend. So far, so good. \n\nTurns out, Hooters Casino Hotel is located next to the Excalibur, New York New York Hotel, and the MGM Grand, so there was plenty within walking, er stumbling, distance. \n\nAt this point, Taylor's judgement seemed to be the least impaired (he was driving) as he didn't consume any road sodas, so it was up to him to verify the last key factor in our search. After further review, how could we *not* love the girls in their sexy Hooter girl uniforms? Didn't see any sausage, either. Only sexy ladies dealing black jack, roulette, craps, you name it. \n\nWe weren't in Vegas for an hour, and we'd already hit the Jackpot.\n\nWe checked in promptly, and headed up the room for to get settled in and form a loose plan of action for the night ahead. \n\nAfter drinking and dancing at the Piano Bar and Coyote Ugly in the New York New York Hotel, we hit the gaming floor at Hooters where the cocktail waitresses kept the white russians stiff and flowing ALL night long. We didn't stop gambling and drinking until well after sunrise, my buddy Brian rolled in at 9:30 a.m. up a c-note and still drunk as a skunk. Who would've thought you could ride a 5 dollar roulette table for 6+  hours in Vegas on a Saturday night? \n\nOverall, our stay at Hooters Casino Hotel was a great experience, with cheap rooms, clean and fun atmosphere, and it's central to the main strip in Vegas. It's a nice alternative to the usually pricier hotels like MGM Grand or The Monte Carlo, for example."

They, my partner, and I had just spent a week first on a grueling 1900 mile road trip from Austin to northern Nevada and then camping in a barren desert for the Burning Man art festival - and figured it would be nice to spend some time with each other just decompressing.  So we decided we would pay ahead for a room with a bed big enough for both of us, knowing that it would take all day to drive through Nevada from Black Rock Desert to Las Vegas.\n\nWe paid ahead for a room with a King size bed for three nights, got up at 7:30 am and drove all day from Burning Man in North Nevada, got in around 11 pm exhausted and haggard, looking forward to nothing more than just crawling into a clean comfortable bed with each other and relaxing, before spending  - and they tell us that they will only put us in a room with two doubles and told us in a bored voice, \"too bad, even though you paid ahead for a king room, it is first come first served.  Tough, there is nothing we can do, that's policy.\" In effect, you can only get what you paid for if you come at checkin time - paying for the room ahead of time does not actually secure it.  \n\nOur friends were, of course, screwed over by the same policy and were no happier about it.\n\nAvoid any business that does not deal honestly with its customers like this - this is worse than what you would reasonably expect from Hooters and Las Vegas combined.  I expect trashiness from Hooters and sleazy business practices from Las Vegas - but bait and switch is outside the bounds of any business claiming to be reputable."

The rooms are small, but theres plenty of space to do shots with everyone before running out onto the strip.\n\nAny ways, I hated staying here, it wasn't my cup of tea though there wasn't anything inherently wrong about it. I'm just picky I guess. But I really enjoy the ambiance on the casino floor for casual fun. If i'm feeling fancy, I head over somewhere else, but when I'm romping and stomping with a big group, we usually end up here at least for a bit. I'm a big fan of hooter's restaurants already (love hot wings) and this is like one big hooters restaurant, but with slot machines and craps tables.\n\nI actually managed to come up 190 bucks on a hot table here (later lost on poker in the Aria) so I enjoyed it more than usual. Even if I lost it all it would of been ok since we had some fun with friendly and totally wasted strangers.\n\nThis is probably the closest to the strip hotel/casino that doesn't have roaches and is under 100 bucks most of the year. It's good if you're on a budget, or don't actually plan on sleeping in the rooms."

Hooters is not a luxury hotel and does not pretend to be either.  Hooters is located just off the strip, across the street from the MGM.    First, it was inexpensive.  Second, the rooms were clean and large.  And finally , it had everything you could expect in a hotel- multiple swimming pools, multiple restaurants, parking, cable tv and good water pressure.  Hooters is a short walk from the action of the strip.  Las Vegas is a great tourist destination which you can't experience from a hotel room.  Therefore, Hooters is a great place to sleep, shower and change before you head out for your Las Vegas adventure.  Now, if the place were a dump or if you were expecting luxury then maybe you would  be disappointed.  I would go back again."

In fact, I believe that  I've actually paid nearly three times as much for the same exact room at Bellagio minus the view of the water fountain of course.. But I rather have a view of the parking and save the rest for a tasty buffet!  Hooters provide their guests with the basic necessities... Comfy beds, bathroom, tv, and wifi.  Plus it is in close proximity to the other hotels on the Strip which I appreciate.  They also offer room service as well.  The price for the room service meals seems very affordable and comparable to the price they charge at the restaurant.  I came here for Spring break and I'm really glad I booked a room with Hooters!  The only downside is that even though it is near the main Strip... You would still have to drive.. Overall, Great room at an affordable rate!"

We were told we could come down and change rooms but we'd have to pack up our stuff and stand in line again. Really? The small vanity mirror was broken off the wall. The room was dark, not enough lights. And we found half a joint on our balcony. The carpet looks like someone has puked on it many times and it wasn't cleaned properly. There was toothpaste still on the bathroom faucet, wasn't ours! Calking needs to be replaced in the bath tub. Even the bathroom sink is cracked with black in it. We paid WAY too much for this room.

I didn't use the showers because I was traumatized after reading all of the cockroach stories so I stayed away from the bathroom in general as much as I could.\n\nIn the morning, the housekeeping lady knocked on our door at around 10 a.m.  Checkout was at 12 p.m.  We told her we didn't need it but she opened our door anyways using her own card and barged in....talk about rude!  We told her our checkout is at 12 p.m. and she left.\n\nTip:  Remember to sign up for the player's card.  You get $10 worth to play on the slots (if you put a dollar in), $5 worth to match your $5 on table games, and a $5 off food items from Hooters or Mad Onion (another restaurant that is in there).\n\nAlso, if you check in on FB, you get a free pint of beer (I got Blue Moon).  If you text a specific number they give you, you get 10 free wings.  Lots of freebees but they don't let you combine all of the coupons together.\n\nOur order literally took over an hour to arrive.  We ordered 20 wings and 2 orders of fries....how hard is that....  On a positive note, they comped us $10 for being late and $10 more for checking in on facebook (apart from the beer) so that was cool.  They also had live music playing and the gentlemen and the lady playing were quite good.  I told them to play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and they sang the sexiest version of it I have ever heard.\n\nI also used their $10 free slot play to win $40.

It seems like there was hasnt been any new games for slot machines. Nothing is really entertaining at the casino. They dont even have a lounge! If you stay here and wants to have a good time gambling, i suggest just walk right across MGM Grand although getting to the sidewalk requires you to walk more than you are suppose to. The next time we go to Vegas, we'll pay the extra 40-80 dollars more charge for a different hotel by the strip. I am pretty sure it would be worth it rather than paying less and stay at this hotel."

I checked into the hotel on December 5th and was given room 263 in the Bungalow tower. The room was nice as I expected. The next morning on Saturday December 6, my boyfriend and I noticed the hot water was not working in the shower. I called the front desk and they said they would send somebody right away. After waiting half an hour nobody had arrived. I went ahead and left the room and went to the front desk where a gentleman named Marco assisted me. Marco said that he would give us a separate room to shower in. He offered room 448 in the OCEAN tower. I thought that it was completely ridiculous to walk all the way across the casino and take an elevator just to shower. When I complained they said we could just keep the  ocean tower room to stay. (Why did they not offer that in the first place?) the manager also reversed my resort fee which was very appreciated. \n\nAfter packing up all our stuff we switched rooms at about 12pm. We left the room for the day to visit the strip. We came back to the room at about 530 pm and took a nap. At about 820pm my boyfriend woke up to take a shower. As he closed the bathroom door I HEAR THE DOOR TO THE HOTEL ROOM  OPEN. Keep in mind I am in a t-shirt and underwear laying on the bed! I look up and see a glimpse of somebody walking away quickly and closing the door. Confused I call my boyfriend asking if he left the room and he said no that he was still in the shower. I was completely frightened because someone was able TO OPEN MY HOTEL ROOM DOOR AND WALK IN.  About 5 minutes later someone starts to furiously knock on our door, I open it and a lady in a blue shirt and a man in a black jacket/maroon shirt start questioning me. They state I was supposed to check out today and should not be in the room. When I explain the situation about switching rooms they ask to see my ID. When they check my ID they said thank you and did not even apologize. After a few minutes I walk down to the front desk asking why someone opened my room door without knocking, the manager named \"H\" (who was also the lady in the blue shirt who checked my ID) denied that anyone opened the door before they knocked. I was extremely upset at this because I know what I saw and heard. She completely denied that anybody opened the door without permission. I am extremely upset at this situation as hooters violated my privacy and also did not take the liberty to update their system to acknowledge my new hotel room. I would like a refund for my weekend."

Though, we were woke up at 05:00 to construction sounds. Called the front desk and they said they would waive one night resort fee.  YAY! $29 :( Then after I called the front desk at 06:30 the noise stopped for a little while and then the construction person was using a mini jack hammer to pull up tile and the grout in the bathroom.  So I decided to talk to the contractor and then it stopped.\n\nInfo for Hooters Management:\n\n1) If people have stayed at a hotel for 4 days they don't want to change rooms.\n2) If you put out a notice saying it will begin at 08:00, make sure your contractor starts at 08:00.\n3) You should realize your facility is not a resort and charge a resort fee.\n\nOther Issues:\n\n1) This is not a place for families or children.\n2) I learned from the LYFT Driver that a lot of the Hookers from out of state come here because the hotel rooms are cheap.  It has to be true because I saw them at the bar in the morning at 03:00 am. Yes, it is Vegas but definitely did not feel comfortable.\n\n\nYes they have cheap rooms, but if you pay a little bit extra, I would rather go to Excalibur or the Tropicana. Do not recommend at all!"

Finally came back after a 2 year hiatus.   I could not believe what was going on.  The entryway to the pool in the back has been sealed off and they have put up a temporary ghetto pool at the entrance of the hotel.  At the lobby, it is nicely air conditioned but at the back towards the elevators, smells like a armpit and felt like a sauna.   My new hangout is at the LUXOR and the M.  I have spoken to some of the employees and they say their days are numbered there."

I would always so no because well this didn't seem like my type of joint (i.e. the uniforms that the girls are required to wear).  \n\nAnyway, so when my roommate told me that we were staying at the Hooters Hotel, well, I really had no choice but to eat here. What are my thoughts now of this establishment? \n\nThe Food: Eh, it's okay. I did try the Hot Wings and I really don't understand people's obsession with them.  The greasiness really just overtakes the chicken flavor. I really disliked that they charge $1 for side-sauce. C'mon! Wings + ranch is a must, therefore they must be sold together, not separate. For shame. \n\nThe Service: Was on point! Our waitress Karen got everything out on a timely manner & was really nice to us ladies.  \n\nThe Girls (because isn't that why men come here?): Not as bad as I imagined.  After going to the Tilted Kilt, the Hooters uniforms are saintly. I'm not sure whether a man or woman designed the outfits, but I'm guessing a man did because they're definitely a throw back to the 90's.  The girls looked like my 90's barbie dolls, you know, Theresa, Barbie, Staci with the scrunchy socks and high waisted shorts.\n\nWill I come here again? No, the food wasn't that great. If I were a guy, I guess I would. The girls are friendly."

Once about a month ago with work to see the Dirty Joke Show because the guys in it were letting my boss, my sister and I in since they were on the radio show I interned at. The other visit was with Arkady G. this past weekend when he came to visit. This is going to be a review combining elments I experienced during both visits.\n\nOk, so the parking garage is really yucky. The elevators are janky as hell. My boss said \"Oh, I thought we were in the Wynn\" when we stepped inside. Yeah, they're the most filthy ghetto elevators ever. \n\nOne thing I really like about this casino is that it's very small. It feels fun and intimate at the same time, and it's not freaking loud at all. LOVE. I hate hearing the electronic poker slots clanging and I didn't notice either time at this place.\n\nThe pool is ok, but the surrounding area is kinda busted (aka the bar area) I like that you can lounge out and nobody checks to see if you're even staying there when you walk out to the pool (which could be a bad thing.)\n\nThe bathrooms here are decent, not totally nasty. I wish the doors were push doors instead of having to touch door handles from the bathrooms. Bleh, oh well, I use a paper towel to open it, whatevs. \n\nSo Arkady went to play black jack. Me being the overly frugal person, I demanded he give me half his chips when he sat down because he already lost $80 at the craps table at the Paris earlier that day. I got to sit at the table, even though I wasn't playing, and I got free drinks (I'm not a beeotch, I only asked for water) and he ended up making $125 in about 15 minutes while we were waiting for our table at The Mad Onion. Not bad at all. The dealer, who was an older white woman was really nice and friendly, in a mom sort of way. \n\nHonestly, if I gambled, I'd probably come here because it's not so freaking loud and the waitresses and dealers are nice and non-threatening, unlike some of the other casinos."

Follow this:  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, no tomato, with mayo, American cheese.  Seems simple right?  I got a bacon cheeseburger, with tomato, no mayo, cheddar cheese?  Wha?!?  Waitress disappeared so I took the tomato off and walked over and got mayo from the bartender.  Ate the burger, and when the waitress came with the check she asked me how the meal was, I told her how they messed up three different parts of one burger order.  Her response?  \"Oh, you know how the kitchen can be\".  WHAT?!??!?  NO I DON'T KNOW HOW THE KITCHEN CAN BE I DON'T WORK HERE!  Jesus nice customer service.  No effort to make things right, just a dismissive comment about how the kitchen can be.  I give this restaurant 2 stars instead of 1 because the fries were good and the burger was at least cooked, but holy hell, learn some customer service (or just learn to make the orders right to begin with)"

Security thugs outnumber the Hooters girls, making the place feel generally inhospitable. The bar was understaffed on a Thursday night with two bartenders taking orders from 20-something customers seated at the bar, as well as fulfilling orders from the floor. Tough job, and unfair to both staff and patrons. \n\nThe pool looks clean, and the gym is nice enough with standard equipment including weight machines and cardio. Otherwise, though, the place is just dingy, like it hasn't been modified in 30 years. It's 2014, and my bathroom sink wouldn't drain. In that sense, it's divey, so if that's your thing, you'll love it here. Unremarkable otherwise, even for the lowlow price of a one night's stay."

The wings and fries hit the spot and went down well with the Blue Moon.\n\nThe restaurant is very clean, and able to accommodate larger parties. What's also great is the food is affordable. Yes the location is on the south end of the strip, but if you need some good old wings, you can't go wrong.\n\nOn tap I believe in addition to Blue Moon there's Coors and Red's Apple Cider (that's a first).

Nothing was cleaned. There were chunks of hair throughout the room. There was a fake eyelash on the shower wall. There was leftover food on the desk. The mirrors had dirty finger prints all over them. The bathroom floor was not clean. I had to buy sanitizing wipes to wipe down all surface areas. \n2. The room was outdated\n3. The hotel smelled horrible. As soon as I got off the elevator my gag reflex kicked in. I'm not sure how to describe it. \n\nThe only good thing was that the staff was very friendly.

Still itching after my horrible stay!\n\nI came to Vegas to attend a convention at the MGM and Hooters was inexpensive and convenient since I can walk across the street to MGM for my workshops.  After the first night of staying at Hooters, I went to my workshop and was scratching throughout the day.  Another night's stay at Hooters and it got worse.  The room we stayed in was infested with bed bugs.  We were on the 12th floor.\n\nWe called them to complain and apparently Hooters knew they had bed bugs on the 7th floor.  Apparently they didn't know they also had them on the 12th.  You'd think if they knew they had bugs on the 7th, they'd really try hard to make sure none of the other floors were infested.\n\nThey were in my suitcase (don't EVER leave your case on the floor) and clothes.  I had to decontaminate everything including washing out my suitcase.  They little buggers hide in cracks and crevices and I had to make sure none of them hitched a ride home or my house would be infested.\n\nYes Hooters was inexpensive and convenient but NEVER NEVER will I stay at this place.  I'm seriously still itching from the scratches.  My right arm had a total of 11 bites.  My left arm had a total of 7.  My right leg had 5.  My left leg 3.  Back five.  Face, one.\n\nDISGUSTING!!!!"

So I'm only going to review this Hooters against other Hooters I've been to.\n\nHaving said that, while the girls here are very attractive, they're definitely not as engaged as just about every other Hooters I've been to. That's a big one since part of the Hooters experience is how friendly the girls are. While the wings are just as good as the other Hooters, the menu does not give you the option of having your wings Daytona style, another thing that separates Hooters from other wing places. All in all, the only thing going for this Hooters is its convenience and proximity to the Strip. Otherwise, if you're driving, go to the one on Rainbow Blvd."

We had no problem with the sink or the tub so maybe we were the exception. \n\nI liked the vibe, we had some good luck at the slots, as well as the tables. They have $5 blackjack as well as a $3 table hidden inside of the casino. \n\nI'd advise against shopping in the convenience store as it's a bit over priced. Stop by a liquor store or find a grocery store to get your water or goods. \n\nI LOVED the wings. I've never tried Hooters wings and it was my first time but I was happy. They were nice and crispy and nicely sauced. I tried the spicy garlic and chipotle honey. The spicy garlic was good but SOOO spicy the chipotle was perfect. I probably lived off wings that weekend I was there, hahaha. I also tried their soup, broccoli cheddar which was eh, really soupy not thick like other places. \n\nFor sure, I want to try the Mad Onion next time I'm there. \n\nTo be honest, we weren't in the room a lot, just when we were sleeping and resting from the endless drinking and gambling or after shopping. It was perfect for our needs and I'm pretty sure we'll come back. Plus, how can I say no to wings that are open 24/7 whenever I have a hankering for them on vacay?!! :D"

You know, the one with the dead coyote being picked apart by the Vultures. Yeah, that's the one. That would seem like a suite at the Ceasar's during a free money give away to every room compared to the hell hole that is the Hooter \"Hotel\". Right when I get to my room, I think it's not to bad. Little view of the pool, 2 beds, and a door. Functional right?? That's where the good times ended for that room. Right when I went to open the \"balcony\" door to have a look over the pool, the door was already off the railing. Luckily my buddy and I were able to place said door back on the railing. So with our door from finally closed, we decided to turn on the A/C as it was hotter than the Devils asshole after Indian food night in hell in our room. Low and behold it doesn't work. So after tinkering (flipping the knob until something happened) for a while, it goes from summer on the sun to a nice cooled room that now smells of antifreeze. So we let it blow it's little heart out when it decides that it had an epiphany and decided to change its lifeless being and become a fire breathing dragon. So here we are back to summer on the sun. I can't help but laugh as we turn off the demon spawn of Elsa and Trigon (Comic book villain). We decided, the next morning, to head to another casino where our friends were at thinking that at least we'll have a clean room to come back to. Wanna guess what didn't happen????? You got it!!! No one came to clean anything. I know that we're grown men and we should be able to keep a clean room (which we did for the most part), but I mean come on. Same towels in a pile on the floor. Same way the beds were left. Not even as much as an eyelash was moved. We clean up the room, wash up (face towel after my shower) and headed out. Next day, we decided to see if something would change. Oddly enough it did. Someone came up to our room and made one of the beds and left some water bottles. Towels were still in a pile though. We start laughing and brush it off. Decided that it's not worth talking to management over as I'm leaving anyway. So here I am just to let anyone who thinks that this place would be a suitable place to stay as it's super cheap. Don't.. Save your money or just throw it into a fireplace because that's worth waaaaaayyyyy more to watch than stay at the Hooters \"Hotel\"."

That kind of customer service makes me happy. And it's why I always return to Hooters. Just like they say, it's not fancy....it's fun!"

            "review": "Inexpensive small hotel casino that offers little else.  The Hooters restaurant in this place is HUGE but I don't think the food is all that great compared to other Hooter restaurants.  Needless to say, pray that you don't get one of the older rooms overlooking the pool known as the bungalows...Instead opt for the Tower rooms and get the highest floor possible, trust me.\n\nI stayed here while working on a fighter and he had connections to this hotel so I gave it a whirl (it was free).  As a \"VIP\" they brought up a gift basket containing a cheap bottle of wine and 4 Bud lights with peanuts and a Hooters 50cent wings coupon.  Really?  OK my expectations where floored after this.\n\nThe room is a typical Howard Johnson/Ramada Inn type of room with Tommy Bahama theme.  Nothing special but the Tower rooms were new and clean with a window air conditioner.  The Bungalow rooms were horrible.  The hallways stunk and were dirty, the rooms were old with sliding screen doors from the 70s.  They all had the Tommy Bahama theme but these rooms and floors were in trouble and need to be torn down.\n\nThe casino bar is literally bigger than the casino or poker room that was located next to the elevators and by the bathrooms.  Nice.  They have a Punishment Store (Tito Ortiz) that looks like a closet.  The staff is friendly but very young, like a bunch of young 18-21 year olds here.   The club here is non-existent but the pool is actually very cool with a huge water fall.  Definitely a shorts and T-shirt sipping on a bud light kind of place."

My cohorts and I were hungry and hungover so they wanted some chicken wings and what better place than to have some at Hooters?\n\nThis probably would not have been my first choice as I wanted to go somewhere new and different but my cohorts insisted on coming here. My cohorts order the chicken wings while I was the oddball and ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with potato salad and mozzarella sticks as appitizers. While everyone else were drinking beer, I was too hungover to drink that soon so I got raspberry lemonade along with a glass of water.\n\nThe mozzarella sticks were delish as was the chicken sandwich. However that potato salad was awful. Just bland and no seasoning at all. I should have stuck with the baked beans. The raspberry lemonade was way too sweet. My cohorts enjoyed their respective meals, so they didn't have any complaints.\n\nThe restaurant as well as the hotel was too hot. Very uncomfortable eating our meal, especially while we were in recovery mode. The waitress did a good job overall. Overall we enjoyed our meal for the most part so I'll give this joint three stars."

Seriously, I've stayed there twice: once I paid $35 per night, and the other time we took advantage of a friend's free two-night stay promotion that came in the mail.  And when they say free, they mean it... no small print or extra fees, just a kick-ass time set to the timeless beats of Prince's Purple Rain.  (I mean it, they must have played through that entire album like five times throughout my three-day stay... and I am certainly not complaining!)\n \nOkay, so the rooms aren't fabulous... they've been known to have some unidentifiable brown stains on the carpet and I'd prefer not to imagine what other horrors would surface with aid of a black light. The casino is small and the cocktail waitresses are often old and jaded (but don't worry guys - the mandatory uniform still includes tight orange booty shorts)... However, in my opinion, all of this simply adds to the character of the place! Hooters is close enough to the strip, and to the shuttle that takes you through Excalibur, Mandalay Bay and the Luxor, that you can easily get your fill of the flashier money-pits that make Vegas what it is... and then, broke but too drunk to care, you can meander on back to Hooters at 5am with no trouble at all. Maybe even stop at Coco's on the way for a Lumberjack Breakfast.  Honestly, it's kind of a relief to be back in a smaller, less overwhelming casino after hours navigating the endless mazes that characterize the monster hotels... I mean, they are designed specifically to keep you in. \n\nI root for the Hoots!!"

The only good thing was the potato salad. The burger was bad....lots of bbq sauce but no actual flavor. Hooters girls need a major reality check, just cuz u are wearing really short shorts and a tight top with a push up bra doesnt automatically make you hot or give you a perfect body especially not with all the flat asses walking around.  All the girls were wearing drag queen make up and most had false eye lashes.  Some of the guy cooks were actually hotter than the female waitresses, lol!  The pina colada was severly watered down.  Potato salad was really good. \n\nI highly doubt Ill ever come back."

Honestly their shows didn't look all that great anyway.  The room was ok...old tv, old carpet, old bathroom, just run down and in need of a makeover.  On a positive note there were no bugs and the bed was ok.   None of the soda machines on any level that we checked worked and a soda in the bar cost 4 bucks.  I think the worst part of our 7 day stay was the \"hooters girls.\"  Completely snobby and didn't bring drinks to us while we gambled.  There were hours that we never even seen a waitress walk by.  I asked at the front desk if they served drinks and they said yes.  I then mentioned that nobody has been by for quite awhile.  The front desk told me to take my issue up with the waitress.  Wow...\n\nThe casino is small and extremely run down but again what do you expect for the price...?\n\nAnother issue is the sewer smell outside...if you walk from hooters towards Tropicana or mgm the smell on the parking lot will take your breath away.  I guess that isn't a problem for hooters but it was definitely a drawback.  I also read on Wikipedia that this casino just got bought last year and the new owners may convert it to a holiday inn.  I sure wish someone would update the rooms and hire better waitresses.  This place could have some potential.\n\nI forgot to mention that I sat at Pete & shortys for over 45 minutes and nobody waited on me...so I left."

The fixtures etc all seemed to be replaced but with repair/apartment grade stuff.  Big dings in the drywall.  Old rugs that you don't dare walk on in bare feet, (sleep in your socks if you get up at night). Real, real basic accomodations.\n\nThe Good:  Really cheap rooms. Regular people in the bar and gaming area.  Easy to get in and out of out front, not a zoo.  Kind of a fun but controlled frat house atmosphere in the small casino area. Right across the street from the MGM if you want all the fluff and $25 crap tables and $25 black jack tables.  The in-room coffee maker was good.  made shaking off the morning cobwebs a little easier.  No place for breakfast that I could find.  All the staff was great and very friendly/helpful and the \"Hooter's Girls\" working the casino area were very easy on the eyes and nice.\n\nLike everything is this world, you kinda get what you pay for.  If you want a cheap place to crash or don't care about the fancy schmance casino, this place will work.  I took a chance and stayed here while in Vegas on business.  Probably won't go back unless I was on a bare bones budget, and even then I'll look around for something else."

This is for SURE a destination next time we get to Vegas.  I'll take the money I save on the dinner and pump it into the slots. :)\n\nDon't think I'd ever stay here after seeing the reviews here (though I could probably be convinced to slum it if the deal was good enough), but I'm already looking forward to returning, drinking way too much whiskey, shouting \"winner winner fishy dinner\" over and over when I hit the bonus, and having the staff and cleaning crew cheering us on..."

We opted to stay here instead of a hotel on the strip because it is the cheapest place during the weekend, but it is not worth it. The entire place is dirty, outdated, and run down. Our floor had a water leak and the floor was sopping wet which caused the entire level to reek like cat urine. The constant lingering smell of weed in the elevators was a classy touch as well.\n\nI don't think this hotel has been updated since the early 90's; still a huge box tv, outdated decor, dirty showers and floors. The shower was so incredibly frustrating I almost just gave up on showering...it literally took 5 minutes to get the temperature to a degree that didn't cause me to have third degree burns; if you moved the switch even the slightest amount, scolding hot water. There was also this thick red fluid on the shower curtain that has obviously been overlooked by housekeeping. \n\nEven though our room was disgusting, the thing that made this experience the worst was the HORRIBLE customer service. Our hostess for the Hooters restaurant was one of the rudest i've encountered in a while. We were waiting in line and a group of men proceeded to cut in front of us; the hostess seated them and came back to tell us it was going to be 'a long' wait because all the seats were occupied....this is after she allowed them to cut in front of us. When we confronted her, her response was simply \"whatever\". We ended up getting a $50 voucher because of her rudeness, but that hardly mattered because the treatment we got from the Saloon staff was just as bad. They knew we had a free meal voucher so apparently this meant we weren't worthy of even having our waters refilled once nor did we deserve to be asked one time if we needed anything. Terrible service. \n\nThis place is so cheap that all those posters that advertise a \"free\" 6-pack of pepsi after earning so many player points are complete lies; we had a ton of points and saved them up to get our free 6pack once we checked out but the customer service agent said those points were invalid and that only points that were earned in one day were able to be used. Hmmm. After being treated horribly and spending hundreds of dollars in your casino, you can't give us a free six pack of pepsi that cost no more than $4.00?! What a joke of an establishment. How is this even allowed to be in business? Every worker I encountered here was miserable. \n\nThis place may be cheap, but they are rude and the hotel is disgusting. I'd rather spend a couple hundred more dollars to not have to endure this place."

            "review": "I will admit, the idea of booking a room at a hotel from a company that makes their money by marketing hot wings with big breasted women seemed a little bit scary, but with a smaller budget than usual, and a huge hankering to go to Vegas, I crossed my fingers and went with it...and was immensely pleased with my decision. \n\nThe total cost of my room (split with a friend of mine and without the stupid resort fees) was 88 dollars for 2 nights. Now I don't know about you, but to me, that is a steal anywhere, and especially in Vegas. Again, I was worried that I had just thrown myself into a trashy, rundown dump of a place but again, I was wrong. The room was clean and comfortable, complete with a sliding door and dinky little patio, not good for anything, but great for airing out the room and letting in some fresh air. The beds were also came as surprise. They weren't the biggest beds I've ever seen in a room, but they were incredibly comfortable, and clean. Sheets were soft and felt washed. (I've stayed in other hotels where the sheets were \"Clean\" but smelled old and  musty). Even the bathroom was a nice once. Big shower, nice long counter top, comfy toilet. Only bummer was there was no fan to keep the air fresh, but then again, I was in the room so little, it didn't really come to my attention.\n\nI was worried about location as well. It's off the strip, down Tropicana, but even then, it's only about a block from the main drag, and an easy block at that. It may be the last real \"Casino\" on Tropicana, but it's amazingly close to MGM, New York New York, Excalibur, and Luxor, all of which can be walked to in less than 5 minutes. \n\nThe Casino itself is on the small side, with fewer tables and slots than most larger ones, but they do have 3 dollar blackjack 24/7, even if it's a little difficult to get on the table at 11 pm. But I'm not a huge gambler and rarely gamble at the hotel I stay at so the small atmosphere didn't bug me in the least.\n\nNot too many complaints then other than some of what others have said. Parking is easy to get to and close to the hotel but the garage is oddly designed, and covered in random places with annoying speed bumps, the outer elevators are, as someone else stated, creepy: they're dirty, scratched, and oddly cold, kinda like a horror film (but then again the ride is like 10 seconds each way, and you're in the actual car for so little, you forget these things as soon as you enter the casino). And finally, while the garage is close to the casino, the elevators are all the way in the back so if you have a lot of luggage, be prepared to lug it all the way from the rear of the casino to the check in counter all the way at the front. \n\nSimply put Hooters is the best value for your hard earned cash. Sure, you could go spend 200 or 300 a night on a room at the Aria, or Caeser's palace, or you could save all that money for other things and book a cheap cheap, quality room at Hooters."

They had maybe 3 or 4 tables and the rest of the place was empty and yet they were making us wait like 15 mins to be seated and when we went to go sit in the bar area they pretty much kicked us out and said we had to be seated by a hostess even though it clearly says on the door that the bar area is for self seating.

My advice is go somewhere else, and if you want to see cute and well built women, check out the nicer resort hotels (such as Caesars Palace) for their wait and support staff and you will do better. Hooters has great marketing, but all else is mindless foolery because there is nothing to like or enjoy about their tasteless, low-level quality food,"

The waitress took my order, brought it and that was the last I saw of her.

I twas a Thursday night, and the casino area was dead. It was worse than casinos in Reno. The only reason we came here is because we were staying at the Tropicana and wanted a change. \n\nThe only reason we stayed was because we were hungry and wanted a cheap dinner...wings. We got an assortment of wings, and they were just okay. The waitress was nice, but completely forgettable. It was one of our friend's bday, and all the waitresses were about to sing, but the \"main\" waitress forgot the song, so they had to go back, teach her, and they came back 20 minutes later. Really??\n\nWe went to a bar which, again on a Thu night, had maybe 10 people in it. And we roll in with our group of 8 and pretty much take over. Again, no fault of the bartender, as he was cool, but the vibe is just sad. \n\nWhen there are so many choices on the strip, I don't think you need to bother with this one."

It is conveniently located in prime S.

Oh ... yeah. Hahahahaha! You're probably correct about that. \n\nThis man -- some mid-level executive at HQ -- apparently doesn't lie. His words (paraphrased): that place sucks. I wouldn't stay there for free. \n\nTrue story.\n\nI've been here for shows.

The manager never came back to check on the food, the food runner had an attitude and the sever spent more time flirting with the table next to us than checking up on our returned food, the only thing good during my visit was our drinks. We frequently go to the Hooters in Anaheim, CA and we have never had something like this happen to us or received such unprofessional service."

Got booked this hooters hotel by a site that gave it 3 stars.\n Not sure in which world this qualifies as three stars. Honestly the only time I would stay here again is if someone paid me to stay...and even at that point I may have to decline. I would have to be more than vegas drunk to pay to stay here. Period.  The first thing I noticed was how MUSTY this place was. It felt like I was in a sauna. It was hot yet damp....the hallways were dark and smelled of old gym socks and cold fries.  There was all kinds of old sheets and plates, trash, etc all along the outside doors of the hallways. Like it was a ghost town. The carpets were stained and dirty. \n Even the carpet in our room was old and dirty. I would not take my socks off and walk on this floor in fear I'd contract a disease that science has yet to discover. ...our bathroom floor was no better. The tiles looked old and stained, and the toilet was so vintage that the acrylic was peeling off inside the toilet. I didn't dare sit on that toilet, I did some serious hover action. Who knows when it was cleaned last....the shower also had some hair in it.  And the shower water  literally would go from Arctic temps to boiling water  in a matter of seconds. Worst shower of my life!!! DO NOT stay here! Unless you are ok with possibly contracting some sort of disease, or if you are on a mission to make motel 6 look like the Ritz, you are probably better off at circus circus."

I booked my reservations online, confirmed my time of arrival  a couple of days in advance and confirmed the type of room requested would be available.  When I showed up, I was put in a smaller room than requested on the first floor next to the parking lot.  The bathroom floor was also peeling up.  Other than the noise from outside and the flooring in the bathroom, the room was average.  The next morning, I was moved to the type of room requested; however, I was informed I could not be refunded for the difference in charges for a night in a smaller room since I booked online through one of their travel partners.  I was offered a credit toward bar tabs and onsite food expenses, which I accepted.  The new room was great.  Had they put me in it initially, they would have probably received three stars.  The pool bar was great... lots of people, everyone was very friendly.  Everyone in the gaming area was very friendly and a joy to be around.  Drink service at the tables was slow at best, even in the mornings when the casino was near empty.  All in all, I had fun, great atmosphere, but I felt a little let down.  I'm hoping I caught them on a bad day as far as the room, and maybe the drink service gets better later in the day... I may give them another shot someday."

Oh, and some of the old ladies at the pool were yesterday afternoon too.\n\nValue:  for an average of about $22 a night plus resort fee ($11.15), it's an excellent price. Other cheap hotel/casinos in the area charging in the same range seem to be The Riviera, The Stratosphere, and Circus Circus.  I prefer this for the location as it's easy to walk to the MGM, New York New York, Planet Hollywood, and The Cosmopolitan. Plus, it's not as lame.\n\nRoom:  it's a nice place to sleep, the bed and pillows are comfortable.  If it wasn't Hooters, the decor would be kinda tacky, with the orange chair and lamps, as well as the green, yellow, and orange leaf designed comforter.  You can easily hear every sound your neighbors make though, which was really the main downside.\n\nCasino:  it's really small, you can't get lost here.  Everything is within eye sight.  Some of the girls working as dealers do have the Hooters outfits on, but like I opened up the review with, nothing smoking hot really.  The casino is pretty low key.\n\nGym/Pool/Resort Fee:  most of us have accepted resort fees, but they don't give you much for it here. You get two 12 oz. water bottles daily.  The gym has 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, 2 bikes, and some free weights and about 7 machines/benches combined.  There was hardly anyone ever at the pool, but it was nice enough.  WiFi was a plus.\n\nStaff:  the guy working the Bell Services most of the time gave the impression he was always being bothered, as well as the chick at the front desk.  When I called the phone # listed for assistance, no one picked up the first 2 times. Maids did a good job though.\n\nDining: with lots of great places in walking distance, I did not eat at the Hooters restaurant or any of their other restaurants.\n\nI only rated 3 stars due to the value.  As I had a 6 night stay in Vegas that was a deciding factor.  For the value it's definitely worth it.  If I was staying somewhere else I wouldn't stop by the casino or restaurants here.  In fact, I really didn't even when I was staying here."

Find another place that suits your lovely and caring personality. Because this establishment does not care. \n\nThe room we stayed in had a weird smell and the floor was gross.

They where having a big gambling promotion to get customers in but the restrictions where so, well, restrictive I ended up not even being able to figure out how to take advantage of it.  Actually walked down to Hooters and tried twice plus attempted to eat there.  \n\nPositives:\nSince I didn't actually partake take this with a grain of salt - cheap gambling, hotel rooms, food & drinks.\n\nNegatives:\nSomewhat disinterested staff, had to ask three different people for help before actually getting any.\nParking lot right out the front door (which foot traffic has to cross to get in) was beyond stinky - dont think I set my bar that high either on that.\nThey have two eating establishments, one casual and one restaurant style.  The \"casual\" one was shut down and the \"restaurant\" one had a 45 minute wait.  Let me be clear, there where two people waiting in line ahead of us and it was a 45 minute wait.  \nThe supposed promotional gambling deal they had going on took 15 minutes to locate and the place isn't big, then it ends up that it is roped off and you have to sign a list to utilize it.  The rest of the slots and tables had about 3 people on them.\n\nI really wanted to give them a chance because they didn't pick a good spot to place themselves but I just couldn't cut them any slack.  SInce I didn't stay in the hotel portion cant rate that but the rest blew."

I was at another hotel and visited to take a look around.\n\nAll I can say is, Wow!  I never would have though that they could have made a hotel so much like a restaurant!  The signature orange colors and wood flooring are seen throughout the casino, restaurants and rooms.  They've even got small tables and stools in the rooms like they do at the restaurant!  I never would have believed it!\n\nThe pool area looked nice, although a little rundown.  This was in Dec 2008, so it may have just been that the cold weather and the winds that were blowing through were keeping things from looking perfect.\n\nI'd equate the rooms to a Red Roof Inn or Days Inn.  Nothing at all fantastic.  Standard, uncomplicated bedding.  Chips and scratches in the paint and signs of being somewhat rundown.  Nothing too scary, but noticable.\n\nFrom what my buddy said the \"free slot plays\" are kind of cheesy.  You're required to use certain machines to play, have to play with higher amounts, and can't really make too many choices for yourself.  He was not particularly impressed.\n\nWe did nosh on the breakfast buffet on our last day (thanks 2-for-1 coupon!) and it was decent.  Much what I would expect a Hooters restaurant to serve if they served breakfast.  They also had great buffalo wing deals after 12 midnight, but by the time we were done hitting the town we pretty much just crashed as soon as we got back, and never made it to the tables.\n\nBasically I'd say that you get what your pay for.  My buddy paid something like $39/night for the room and understood that that wouldn't be getting him a stay in a 5-star joint.  But when you're out on the town most of your trip and don't spend too much time in your room, is an expensive room worth it???"

The excessive stains ON THE CEILING were really disturbing.   Oh yeah,  the cracks in the ceiling were pretty awesome too.  How long has this hotel been there?  Since like 1975?  It's one thing to look OLD, I can deal with old and outdated decor.  But DIRTY?  Come on now.  The room was filthy.   The dust bunnies HANGING down from the top of the bathroom mirror really grossed me out.  I have never thought about bringing my own bathroom cleaners to a hotel but holy crap, I should have at least bought Lysol wipes while at CVS.  I would highly recommend staying some place else.  The pool would have some potential if the freaking concrete was hosed off.  There was a layer of dirt all over the nasty concrete.  Oh, yeah, and what the hell is that smell?!  I didn't realize the nasty scent Vegas sometimes has is actually coming from the Hooters Hotel.   Even a large amount of alcohol couldn't help make this place look better!"

Here is a list of problems I encountered while staying here this past weekend.\n\n-Broken toilet which took over an hour to fix.\n-No towels when asked for (had to call a couple times).\n-Broken lock on bathroom door             \n-Hot & cold water in shower is switched (so my friend took a cold shower because she didn't know)                    \n-No phone service at all (for verizon).\n-Outlets were in inconvenient places like behind the bed so charging phones was a hassle.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest problem I encountered was the rude customer service at the hooters restaurant. I ordered a side of celery to-go and had to wait about 15-20 min for it, but that wasn't the worst part. The waitress, Courrtnee, was extremely rude and gave the customer that came after me his food first even though our food came out at the same time. She then waited about 10 more min to give me my food. She kept looking at the receipt on the bag but never told me to take it. She continued to talk with multiple customers as my food was sitting there in front of her. She easily could have said here's your food but made me wait an unreasonable amount of time for some bizarre reason. She obviously didn't like me or something even though I was extremely polite with her. I never write reviews but this girl's behavior was just ridiculous and unacceptable. Because of her I didn't return to the restaurant the whole weekend I was there. If Hooters wants to improve, their first step should be firing this rude employee who makes guests feel unwelcomed and uncomfortable."

We called soon as we landed to see if our rooms were ready and they said it was. We get there and 1 room isn't ready(we had reserved 3 rooms) so we wait. No one at the front desk is friendly, no smIles. It's like you're bothering them. We get up to our rooms and room#833 which my son and family was given was horrible! The door didn' close good,it looked like someone tried to kick it in,the closet door was off  track, the sliding door didn't lock. They drilled a screw into the medal piece to keep it from opening, but the problem w/ that is you can screw off the screw. So I had my son w/his wife and 2 children (5/6) move to my room #849. Then we discovered that the TV remote didn't work. The shower wouldn't drain and even the bathroom sink. My daughters room #831 had the same problem as #833 w/ the shower and sink. When we booked our rooms online, we thought we were getting flat screen tvs.Well guess again,these were old TV. \n\nSo I complain about my room (833). According to the Asst Manager she would compensate me for it and send maintenence to the room. Maintenance came to room, looked at the door and said he couldn't touch it and had to call security.  And as far as the sliding glass window, he said \"Oh, your grandchildren would have to be tiny to fit though this!\" I asked him,isn't this a safety issue and he responded by saying he will call security. Then security comes up and asked us how long as the door been like this? I responded by telling him that we checked in last night. They acted like we kicked in the door. According to security, no report had been made prior to our call. I told him that I know for a fact that when a room is checked out, you have to make a full report of that  room. Of course security did't say anything. We decided to go downstairs to check out the slots and when we returned we couldn't get into our room. It wasn't the key card, the actual door was jammed. We called downstairs and complained. My husband and I literally sat on the floor waiting for the Asst. Manager to come. When she came she was very apologetic that I thought she actually cared. There was no available rooms at that moment . I did get to move to a better decent room later which the supervisor said just came available. That same night, we hear hammering so I open the door and they are fixing the door to room#833 and the next morning we notice a do not disturb sign on the door.\n\nWell, we weren't comp for the issues w/ our rooms or the inconvenience. The asst manager said we would be, but didn't. Never again will we stay a HOOTERS! And I will tell family and friends.....that they'really better off going to Motel 6.\n\nHooters don't give a hoot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Definitely no frills. They have Keurig coffee machines in the bathroom with complementary Diedrich coffees and a safe. The carpets looked like they were well maintained and they had newer LG TV's with DISH service. You also get complementary WIFI and Valet for your car (I believe Friday and Saturdays for paid guests). We checked past midnight and our heater wasn't working, so we called housekeeping and sent a maintenance engineer at that hour who got the heater going in like 5 minutes. I you have been thinking about going to spend over $130/day on the strip for a Motel 6, you may want to try Hooters for a lot less for clean rooms and still get a Vegas style hotel. Enjoy!"

In Vegas most casinos have servers that are partially dressed so hooters I thought would do it respectfully after watching the show. I was right, the women are less reveling then most casinos but that was it. This is a serious budget hotel. If you have stayed anywhere else on the strip you will hate your life while here. If you usually stay at the local drug infested motel you will love it. Hooters hotel and casino has not been updated in at least 15-20 years. The a/c is loud and old the tvs have outlived their life span the bathrooms are old. I have something I'm going to see a doctor about today on the bottom of my foot from walking on the carpets and floor barefoot. Obviously, the beds are old as well as the linens. I can keep going but in two words it sucks. I was embarrassed to stay there. None the less, I bought more than one room and brought guests who I can't stop apologizing to. This guy on tv talks about how his father started this company and how amazing his father was. If all that's true, that father would role over in his grave if he knew the disgrace his son let people stay in now. For a few more dollars you can stay somewhere else and really not be taken advantage of. It's been months and no one has gotten back to me obviously they can care less. Pay a tiny bit more and stay somewhere else."

When I went to check in the guy behind the counter was a complete a$$hole and told me that hotels.com faxes in the reservations and that it hasn't come in yet (he didn't look) and told me I would have to come back in 45 minuets. I told him that I've never seen it take so long and asked him if e could check the fax because I had to get showered and dressed for a dinner meeting and he told me he was too busy??? WTF??? So after my dinner I went back to the hotel to check in and dealt with another guy that was cool. Now they told me about a $15.00 \"resort fee\" that I would have to pay on top of what I paid for the room. I was really excited about being at a \"resort\" and asked him where I can find the awesome resort part of the hotel that I would have to pay more for and he laughed and said the pool must be it and he thought the resort fee was BS too.\n\nWhen I got the key to my room I headed to the elevator to head to my room. When the elevator doors opened on my floor I almost crapped my pants at how nasty the hallways were. I've NEVER seen such nasty carpet and was thinking I made a huge mistake staying here. When I opened the door to the room I was surprised at how clean the room was after seeing the hallways. \n\nAfter my shower I headed back out to the NASTY hallways, down the elevator and off to the tables. This is where things got better. The dealers were great (but they took my money), the waitresses were great and my late night meal was good. With the waitresses on top of their game and keeping the drinks coming all night long I didn't even notice the NASTY hallways on the way back to my room.\n\nOverall I had a good time but will not stay here again due to the first guy I dealt with and the \"resort fee\". If they just charged $15.00 more for the room I would be cool with it but to try to hide it from you and then hit you with it when you show up is BS (not to mention this place is resort-less). It just makes me feel like they are ripping me off and I'd rather take my business to a hotel that is up front with the price. I did go back on Hotels.com the next day to book another room (not at this one) and looked to se if it said anything about the resort fee and it didn't.\n\nIt would be 3 stars without the a$$hole and the resort fee but thats it."

We check in and carry all our luggage in to our room.  Before we even get to our room we noticed an awful smell in the hallway, it reeked of weed. We set everything down and I run in to the bathroom. I notice that around the toilet it is disgusting. While washing my hands I notice there is dirt/filth all over the hairdryer and light switch. As I come out of the bathroom my husband asks me to come look at something on the bed. I did and it was pubic hair. Upon closer inspection of the comforter we found 3 different places where there was pubic hair. We immediately called the front desk and requested a new room. As we sat waiting on someone to bring us keys to the new \"upgraded\" room we noticed what appeared to be pee stains on the carpet in multiple spots around the room. Also, there was a ball of what could have been fecal matter in the corner of the room. I did NOT inspect it any closer than absolutely necessary. It took about an hour before someone showed up to our room with the keys to the \"upgraded\" room. Not once did anyone apologize for the filthy room or the inconvenience of having to switch rooms. (I do want to add that the Valet that eventually brought us our new key was great. He helped us with our luggage and was very nice.) we get to our new room and while it's cleaner it's still not what you would expect from a Vegas hotel but we made due. It was definitely not an \"upgraded\" room. The view was supposed to be of the pool but since the pool is being remodeled (something we were not informed of prior to booking or checking in) the view was of a bunch of dirt and a construction area. Our bed, while comfortable enough, was sagging a substantial amount in the middle. After the hour and a half ordeal of checking in and getting into our room we decided to go downstairs and have a drink. We met a great bartender named Jackie. She is very sweet, very a consisting, and makes hanging out at that bar more enjoyable. We also met the DJ, a fun, spunky girl that is very entertaining. They both turned our mood around. The next day we go to get ice and the ice machine is broken. It was still broken when we checked out 4 days later. We were supposed to get $10 free play and 2 free drinks during our stay, that never happened. The hotel itself is run down and neglected. There are so many easy fixes that could be done to make it a little nicer. The smell outside the hotel is absolutely awful. Think raw sewage on a hot day. It is gross. The upside was the Hooters restaurant served the best wings I've ever had and for the most part the employees were great. Our last complaint was we had housekeeping walk in our room without knocking on 3 separate occasions. All before the 11am checkout time. I called the front desk in our last day to tell them we had been walked in on twice that morning and was offered a late checkout of 2 pm. We took it and went and had lunch before we checked out. When we went to go get the last of our things out of the room our keys were deactivated. We went and found housekeeping and asked to be let into our room so we could grab our things and go. She refused and told us she didn't have a key. Ummmmm, how exactly does housekeeping not have a key? We asked if she could call down to the front desk and she flat out said no that we could just go down ourselves. She was rude and it was uncalled for. Bottom line, it you want a nice hotel, don't come here. If you're on a budget go to motel 6, you'll probably have nicer accommodations there and better customer service."

The staff members are appropriately dressed, super helpful, and you would never think you were in a frat hotel, because that's what we thought it would be like.\n\nOn the way to our hotel room, which was in the Ocean Breeze corridor (how relaxing), was just a few minutes away past the convenience shop.  \n\nAlthough Hooters exceeded my expectations, I'm not sure I need to go back."

Apparently though, for this place, the type of salad was unnecessarily \"high class\" with its actual greenery, but I liked it - I always like a better salad than just romaine. \n\nBut Hooters gave us live entertainment in the form of  a cover band and boobs. What else do you really go there for? I ordered chicken wings (which were good, though I couldn't finish them), whereas chicken sandwiches and Caesar salads were the other main courses for my friends, and there weren't any complaints to be had. \n\nI go to any Hooters because I like the atmosphere and it seems to be on my bucket list - I've been to quite a few of them. If there's a Hooters, I'm there. At least once. And because you don't expect much, you get a lot more. \n\nInexpensive food, cheap drinks, loud music, and pretty girls (for the most part) - that's the point of the place, so why fight it?

He suggested Vegas, I told him I'll book the hotel.\n\nI'm booking this place laughing on the inside picturing us betting with Hooters girls saying \"Hit Me Honey\" in my best Andrew Dice Clay voice.\n\nIn reality, there were some hooters girls in uniform as well as guy dealers.\n\nAfter we checked in, we decided to go downstairs and have a few drinks. Hooters gives you a coupon book with two for one drinks. I get the party started with Patron shots.**The beers and drinks are cheaper here than other hotels.\n\nNow this is for the guys reading this review. Whadda think your going to do at this place, meet girls? Guess again, your eating and drinking with mostly DUDES.\n\nThis place is good for .25 cent wings after 12:00 and the regular Hooters restaurant is open 24/7. We ate at Dan Marinos for Breakfast, another nice place. We had a few laughs here and we did have fun drinking with all the guys we met poolside. This place is like a ongoing frat house if I had to sum it up. Beers by the poolside were flowing as well as laughing with guys from all over the country.\n\nThey also give you a $100 bucks in slot credits. They put $100 bucks in a $5 machine and the max bet is 10 bucks. If you hit the jackpot, you win. If you win anything else, you get nada.\n\nI'm giving it 3 stars. I woke up Saturday morning, played blackjack with a nice bloody mary. Yes, its a little rough around the edges, I wouldn't take my wife here but to meet some old buddys?

Definitely the worst in Vegas, and I've stayed at every level of Vegas casino-hotel from Wynn-Excalibur and many others.  Yes cheap & a buddy had a fantastic price hook up for a reservation he'd made a year prior, but just an absolutely horrendously managed hotel.  And it didn't seem busy at all.  Could be a brand new business grad (or pre-major student) running that place for the service we got.\n\nPretty much it was always \"What's next?!\"  Most staff just really didn't care and also didn't have adequate resources.\n\n-Signs pointing to other parts of room floors were ON PAPER WRITTEN BY HAND lol\n-Toilet hadn't been flushed when we got to room.  I had to kinda push to get any kind of compensation for that disgustingness & the front desk didn't go out of their way to be sincerely apologetic.\n-Toilet flushed *really* slowly\n-Sink barely drained at all. Would overflow if you let it run.\n-One day, maids only cleaned bathroom and didn't even make the beds or empty trash.\n-Everything in bathroom was in short supply.\n-Asked for more towels-never delivered\n\n-Room windows seem like they were picked out of an on-sale catalogue.  They were sliding glass doors.  Ours opened easily..onto what looked kinda like a roof area but did have a balcony-type wall--not an edge-- that looked down into the pool.  It was weird, but hey, the door opened and there was no sign anywhere that said we couldn't be there.  Sure enough though, my buddy gets yelled at by security for being \"on the roof,\" so he goes back inside, and immediately we get an upset call from the front desk about it.  At this point we were both a little frustrated & short tempered w/the service and my buddy hung up on them.  Moments later, two security guards knock on our door about it-one of them's menacing, and my buddy tells them he doesn't want them coming into the room to fix it (turns out Hooters' solution for using sliding glass doors instead of windows was to put one little screw in that locked them-somebody else must've taken our screw out)-get us a new room at this point.  The jerk security guard tells us it's \"fix it or you're evicted!\"  So I call the front desk and get us a room change for all the difficulty already.  In the mean time, my buddy closes the door on them while I make the call, and the jerk one says \"You're lucky these doors don't slam or you'd be evicted!\" Also patronized & accused me of lying/being an idiot about not knowing we weren't supposed to be out there.  The door opened freely man and we were out there for 2 minutes!  That goes on till we get a new room, and they bring even more security guards.\n\n-Got a package delivered to hotel-even emailed Hooters ahead of time about it-and it took them a whole day/night to get it from where it was delivered to the bell desk where I could pick it up. What!? Ridiculous and unacceptable. Staff made it seem standard.\n-Bell desk didn't always answer, would go to a standard cell-phone type voicemail that hadn't been personalized/recorded at all. Voicemail went unreturned.  \n-Want clothes laundered? Deliver em downstairs yourself! No slip or pick-up in room, even though the room guide says to the contrary.\n-TV only worked sometimes.\n-No fridge\n-Doors didn't close fully on their own-dangerous.\n-No button for front desk on phone (had to request extension from operator), staff had to ask for my room # every time, & different desks weren't on the same page about who was going to have my package.\n-Food options very limited.  To Hooters pretty much.  Got the same menu item twice-once was really good, next time not very.  Fried pickles were terrible & I love fried pickles.  Service in restaurant bar area was very (light) hit or (hard) miss.\n-Bar area music the first afternoon was so depressing that we changed our order to to-go.\n-Late check-out only offered with a call AFTER 7 AM, and by the time I made the call in the AM, they said no.\n\nPositives:\n-Blackjack tables & low minimums.  Some dealers still were so-so or straight moody, but the cute ones tended to be a lot of fun personality wise AND yes, as eye candy.  Find brunette, (white) Jennifer!  She made me money literally every time I sat down with her.  REALLY fun dealer & gave me the best blackjack run I've ever had.  Like I said, Jennifer: Tiffany's or Jared's?  You're the only one for me!\n--Even there though, some of **the other** dealers and floor staff were having issues.  More dealing flubs than I'd seen & some weird table security (I think) drama going on.\n-Restaurant cover band ROCKED IT\n-Friendly, helpful bell desk guy"

The bums have made a home on the NW corner of the Hooters property near the sidewalk and use the small wooded area there to vacate their bowels.

However, I really enjoyed my stay here.  The room was clean, the shower pressure was good, and they cleaned my room after I left for the day.  They had clean towels on hand when I needed it and had some great complimentary stuff like water and free slot play offers. More bang for my buck: I stayed 2 nights for $32.50 a night. By far one of the lowest rates for a hotel right off the strip.  I also enjoyed the fact I could get wings from Hooters any time of the day 24 hours a day.  If you sign up with the Owl club there you can get wings for 25 cents after midnight till 6am.  Tacky and unrefined? Yes.  But if you don't mind the orange color and Florida style room this is a great place to crash at for such a low price.  I heard they filed for Chapter 11 recently so I hope this place makes it.  It really is a little gem of a hotel.  Oh yeah...they also have a great looking wait staff aka the Hooters girls.  You got to watch the introduction to the hotel on the TV when you get there...its cheesy and entertaining at the same time.  I think I watched it at least half a dozen times.

You can stand at one end of the casino and see the other end very clearly.  Their giftshop by the entrance seemed to never be open.  The room I stayed in had one power outlet and it wasn't by the desk.  The bathroom door didn't fit through the door frame for some reason so it wasn't able to shut.  The air conditioner didn't work but I didn't mind.  \n\nI gave a star for the room service ladies and gents.  They were always greeting me and offered towels galore.  The second star is for their mini 24/hr convenience store located by the elevators and pool entrance.  Everything you need is in there.  \n\nSpeaking of the pool, it doesn't look like what it does in some of the yelp photos.  I think they renovated it and now it's just two pools. The waterfall and two \"mini\" pools are gone. \n\nOverall, if you're on a budget and want to splurge on other things and just need a place to sleep, this is it."

The second time, they were scattered so we didn't have our meal together.  We originally planned to dabble in the casino with their rewards card promo, but it's quite the catch. You gamble the money and you might get back fifty percent of your net loss. Meh. Not interested. Not worth visiting at all."

Room was disgusting and wasn't going to complain until I tried to take a shower this morning and you either get a super hot shower or super cold. No in between. Plus the drain doesn't work so you not only get a burning hot shower or cold one but you get to sit in the vegas scum your are trying to shower off from the night before. Then when you ask for help two hours later they send up a service guy that can't help you until another two hours. When I spoke to the front desk they said they will switch our room. I informed them I wanted to go eat breakfast before we switched rooms. They promised to hold a room. Once I get to the front desk they have no idea what I'm talking about and Marco front desk tells me there will be a wait for my next room. I informed him I was told a room was already being held for me. At this point I start to get frustrated and ask what happen to the room that was promised. He pretty much told me he can refund my money and I can find another hotel. I reminded him that all hotels are booked and its march madness right now. He said again he can refund me to go somewhere else. At this point I ask for a manager. Imelda comes over and again reminds me she can refund my money to go somewhere else. Nothing they promised me was followed through and now I'm pissed. I finally give up and ask for names and let them know I will be filing a complaint. Then I give my phone number to them to call me once they pull their heads out of their asses. As I am walking to the elevator Imelda calls me and said she has a room ready that's a suite with one bed and a pull. For you to get any service or help you have to go through a miserable five our ordeal and ruin half your time on vacation to get any help. Worst service in my life will never recommend this hotel or restaurant to anyone. Hate this place in hell."

But it just doesn't seem right somehow. . .I mean, it's a Hooters. $20 (plus a resort fee though. . .don't forget about that sneaky little mofo) got me a pretty great room here. I think they might have upgraded me, but it was surprisingly nice, alarmingly spacious, and refreshingly clean. Pretty decent view too. This was my home base for several days when I first moved down here and was looking for an apartment, and it did its job admirably. The Mad Onion restaurant, though nothing to write home about, also did its job. For an early (like before 6am early) breakfast, the special prices can't be beat. Chicken fried steak for like 3 bucks or something. A-ok in my book. My only real gripe. . . NO WIFI. none. They do have wired access in the rooms, but my computer doesn't have an ethernet plug so that did me no good. And I think it costs extra anyway. Still, for the budget traveler who wants to stay in a place that is effectively on the Strip (definitely close enough to be convenient), this is certainly worth checking out."

On our trip 6 months ago, my wife and I went to hooters and enjoyed playing on the cheap 21 tables.  My wife suggested, \"Let's go down to Hooters and try the chicken wings again (to see if last times SHITTY wings was a fluke) and play some cheap tables.\"  It was a plan, we filled up our yards we bought from Wal-greens and started walking to Hooters.  Once we got there the line for food was about 45 minutes.  We had no interest in waiting that long for another possible let down.\n\nPlan B.  Cheap tables it is.  Although the cheapest table we could find was 10 min.  At this point we were happy to just be able to sit next to each other at the tables and play.  We really didn't wanna play that much per hand, so we laid down 20 and said, \"screw it!\"  Welllllll, about  two hours later we were both up to 200+ dollars each.  We were so shocked we just had to keep going!  After losing a few and winning a few and feeling DRUNK, we mutually agreed it was time to cash in and mosey back towards the T.I. where the bed was much closer.  \n\nFrom the point of getting colored up to walking to the cashier I blacked out for about the next 10-11 hours and was out of commission about a day and a half.  I didn't remember a damn thing from walking out of the doors, to getting in a cab, to walking to my bedroom and passing out.  It turns out at some point it was RUFIED.  Now please understand folks, I can handle my liquor quite well, and often wake up early the next day outta habit and because of my daughter.  The next day my body was absolutely exhausted, my wife told me my pupils were blasted, and I simply \"did not feel right\".  This was no hang over that my body was trying to kick.  \n\nAs fun as it was to win money, the fact that someone had a different night planned out for us was kinda disturbing.  Now here I am posting my review and I'm feeling like an ass for not yelping this place before I came here.  You dont see too many reviews as bad as this place has.  And for damn good reason I see.\n\nRaymond B. mentioned he was getting \"eyed\" the whole time for giving his wife money right?  The pit boss at the tables was giving me and my wife the \"Eye\" after we started winning that much money. Almost giving us a feeling like we shouldn't be winning money anymore!  We played $10 tables at the T.I a few nights later and had equally as fun of a time and played till 6am.  \n\nAVOID HOOTERS!!! IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK OF GETTING DRUGGED!!!"

The people at the check in desk, Player Relations , Player Rewards desk,cocktail servers and bartenders were really good and very friendly. I never was a huge fan of Hooters' food but there were options like 24/7 breakfast at the tavern and that was good as well. I absolutely love the location. Hooters is within walking distance from several casinos like MGM, Tropicana , The Luxor and Excalibur . The monorail is right across the street at MGM and that was really convenient as well. Security was visible at all times but not intrusive or rude. There were a few things I wasn't thrilled with. Like most casinos check-in is mid to late afternoon and if you want to check-in early there is a fee. If the room is available don't nickle and dime your guests just let them check in early because they will probably spend that money at the slots or tables anyway. The cocktail service on the slot side is almost non-existent during the day. That is probably more of a scheduling issue with management more than the severs not working that area. From what I understand Holiday Inn will , at some point , take over the hotel but leave the Hooters restaurant. I look forward to going back next year ."

A couple friends took advantage of the single deck black jack table and were all in a pretty sour mood by the time they were done.  The dealer had these ridiculous specific rules to follow, from how to hit (can only do it with you cards) to how you're supposed to tap the table, to not allowing you to really talk with other people at the table.\n\nREALLY NOW?\n\nNot worth it.

We arrived on Thursday afternoon and while Hooter's doesn't have their own shuttle, the airport has shuttles going anywhere on the strip for a fair price (I think mine was $12 round trip). We checked in and the guy at the front desk was really nice. I told him we were there celebrating my birthday and he upgraded us to a tower room on the 18th floor! Very cool, especially since it seemed like there we a lot of people there already.\n\nThe room itself was pretty standard. I kind of felt like I had gone back in time though. The room screamed 1976, but then again, you need to remember what hotel you're in. One thing I wasn't crazy about was that they had this great vanity area for getting ready, but someone forgot to put outlets near them... Everything was clean, but the beds had this comforter thing made out of funny material and it was that and the sheets on the bed. I thought about calling down to see if I could get a normal blanket, but decided it wasn't a big deal. \n\nThe casino is somewhat small, but the slots are kind of loose. My first day there I won $150 on slots alone. They advertise 24/7 $3 Blackjack, but I never saw any tables. \n\nThe walk to the strip was about 10 minutes from our room to the front of the MGM. Not too bad, but don't forget anything at your hotel because it sucks to walk back. I spent more on cabs than I wanted to, but if you think about it, Hooters pretty much paid for them with the money I won.\n\nI don't know if I would stay here again. I think I really would have had a better time if I was on the strip. I might stop by the slots here next time I'm in Vegas though."

Its spacious, and an average looking casino at best. (A lot of men stay here). \n\nOne thing I must mention was the smell. As I arrived at Hooters, my palms began to sweat, because i didnt know what to expect. This was my first time staying here, and I was anxious to find out what my experience would be like. \nAs I exited my vehicle, i immediately got punched in the face by a Mayweather hook. The odor that filled the air was the oder you smell in big cities walking down the street. It was sewage! The air smelled like crap! It was awful. \n\nAs i held my breath and walked inside the casino, I hoped that the smell would be better in there. It was. When I walked in I noticed the layout. It was open, they had a few tables in the front and had loads of slot machines towards the middle-back of the casino.\n Check in took about ten minutes. The service wasnt the best. The individual who helped us seemed bored, and was a little rude to us. She handed us the key and pointed to the direction we needed to go towards. I don't even think she talked to us.\n\nOur room was very small, and really outdated, but we did have a lovely view of the strip. \nThe bed was very uncomfortable, and I had multiple bad nights where tossing and turning kept me up. (I just couldn't get comfortable). \n\nThe food was pretty good, if you've been to a hooters before, Then you know its just average wings at best. \n\nThe plus side to Hooters is the 3 dollar blackjack table, and the drinks. Drinks are real cheap. Furthermore the pricing to stay at Hoooters can't be beat. I found great deals on their website :)\n\nOverall my experience was an average one. Its not the worst casino but far from the best... I probably won't stay here soon, i might give it another shot in the future though, depending on whether or not I can find better deals elsewhere."

It is pretty cheap and close to the strip, but the hotel itself and the rooms are pretty old and not very well maintained which is the main issue with this place. I would say that it has a lower than average price/quality ratio since I believe that you can find better deals in Las Vegas.\n\nThe hotel amenities are acceptable, but it lacks a club and a day club which most other hotels on the strip or close to the strip do have. The fact that it is close to the strip partially offsets that, since it is pretty easy to go to the MGM or to other hotels that do have clubs and day clubs. The casino area in the hotel is also very small compared to other ones on the strip or around downtown Las Vegas.\n\nThe parking lot is free, like any other one in the strip area, but it is a little far from the hotel's entrance so I would definitely recommend using the bellboy for your luggage. \n\nOverall, my experience with the Hooters Casino Hotel was a little negative and I would not recommend it since there are better option on the strip in Las Vegas. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"

The normally friendly waitresses I'm used to see around where just a sham here. Very poor service. I definitely don't come here for the food! Ours completely ignored us and was a struggle to get anyone to help us. Wasn't like I was being out of control drunk (I didn't even drink alcohol, just wanted a snack and a friend was staying at the hotel). I'm sure the girls have to deal with the local or visiting normal douche bags that come in there (the clientele was very suspect), but come on, I gave you all 2, 3, 4, 5 chances.....sorely disappointed and by the looks of other reviews, I'm not the only one. As one previous reviewer said \"Come on, its Vegas!\". Totally. Should really step this one up. I'm sure they're getting by on name brand recognition and reputation from the logo than what this place gives out.\n\nHOWEVER - If you're looking for a cheap hotel (as in inexpensive both for the basic room and basic floor), then you've found your place. I have friends that stay here for the price and location and they love it. No extra frills. Basic. Not one of my personal favorites, but if you're looking for this place, then it's there for you and probably would rate this much higher. Not a favorite of mine personally."

            "review": "This was our first time in Vegas and we decided to stay here mainly due to price and proximity to the Strip.  I imagine we read 200 reviews of the place from multiple sites and were ready for the worst.  Surprisingly it was not that bad...if you go in expecting a 1st rate rat trap!\nWe stayed in a basic king room on the 9th floor of the second tower (not the one labeled Ocean).  The room was clean, had a great view of the strip, and had a cold AC.  The hallways leading to the rooms appear dirty - mismatched wall paint and stained carpets (but we read this in multiple reviews so we expected it).  The decor was \"tacky\" Florida - but that's part of the Hooter's slogan.  Our room was missing the Hooter's bar stools and table that they claim on the website.  The bathroom was acceptable.  Large vanity, great shower (never ran out of hot water).  They provided us with face soap, hand soap, shower cap, and lotion.  My wife said she saw shampoo and conditioner on the housekeeping cart, but we did not get any.  WIRED internet service was like $12.50 a night...however, we found at least 6 unsecured wireless signals that we could pickup at no cost (mainly from nearby hotels).  We found in Vegas that you really don't spend a lot of time in the room - so everything was OK!  Good enough for a quick nap then back out!\nPool - the pool is open 24 hours and we went out at about midnight one night.  The pool with the waterfall was to cold for us - but the other pool was about right.  We also used one of the two hot tubs.  We packed beach towels, but the 24 hour gift shop next to the pool gives you small hotel ones to use (I'm sure as part of the resort fee).  There are also ample lounge chairs if you would rather sit and watch or enjoy the weather.  There was only one other group of people out when we used the pool at midnight...it was like having it all to ourselves.  Pool bar was busy and it took forever with only one bartender to get a drink.  Also advertised as \"swim-up,\" I can assure that it is not!\n\nCasino - my wife and I probably had the most fun at this casino.  The drinks flow very freely and we never had a problem finding a cocktail waitress.  We mainly played penny slots and always had multiple runs ins with a waitress (remember to tip good). Its small enough that you can't get lost like some of the others on the strip.  We played some table games for the first time and had some very friendly customers teach us the rules of the tables.                  \n\nRestaurant - We got a package deal that included two tickets for 10 free wings, 2 drinks at the pool side bar, 2 show tickets at the casino, and $100 in free slot play.  We ate at the Hooters inside the casino and would only rate this as subpar.  1. Our waitress was an idiot and had broken English.  She kept giving us napkins with her name on it and said just yell if you need me.  We were right near the bar and it took her 10 mins to get us our beer.  2. We tried to use the two 10 free wings tickets - but were told that we could only use one per table.  It does not say that anywhere on the tickets.  We ended up giving our other ticket to a couple next to us, just because we didn't want to eat wings for multiple meals 3. We ordered medium wings, but it seemed like they put nothing on them.  We ended up putting the table hot sauce on them to add some flavor.\nShow -  We used our free show tickets and saw the Dirty Jokes show with Todd Paul, Geechy Guy, and Mickey Johnson(?).  We almost used the tickets for just the Todd Paul show but realized that his tickets were only $9.95 and the Dirty Jokes show tickets were like $30.  The show is on the second floor in a tiny conference room.  There were maybe only 30 people at our Friday night show.  Seating is not assigned and an usher will escort you to a table.  We lucked out and got front row - but all seats would have been good.  Geechy is hilarious, Todd is OK, and the other guy is forgettable.  Their performance was kinda like when the 4 guys of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour sit on stage at the end of their show together and tell jokes.  I like to heckle and was disappointed with the lack of audience interaction - its mainly them telling scripted jokes.  Worth it for FREE...I might pay up to $15.00 for this.  Our tickets included a free drink at Dixie's Dam Bar downstairs.\nComplaints - 1. We wanted to walk around on the strip with drinks because not many places let you walk around with open containers.  We stopped at the bar right at the entrance to grab a couple drinks.  We asked for 2 Bud Light Limes and the bill was $11.00 for two 12 oz bottles!  Tip- you can find 24oz/32oz cans about a block away by Walgreens for $8.00 for two!  2. The promotional slot play is a scam (in multiple reviews)  3. The owl rewards card is a scam...you must have to gamble like $300 to get to the 200 point minimum for the free t-shirt  AND you have to do that in the first 24 hours of signing up.  \n\nWe would stay here again..."

The Ac kept making loud noises and all of sudden stopped working, the floor I was on had no ice, the carpet is stained so I wore sandals everywhere even in the shower. I believe someone dropped glass in the pool a little girl stepped in it. To me that's the life guards fault if she was paying attention instead of flirting with guys none of this would of happened. I came to the pool a few times and these \"life guards\" we're flirting and talking to these guys the whole time I was out there. It was very unprofessional. Oh and the wings the wings are terrible we got mild and literally were so dry. The white girl didn't even want to take our order sorry I came down stairs in pajamas and not showing my boobs or be a man but damn. She was rude. Then I decided to give them another shot and the Asian girl who took my order for bbq wings was super nice and made up for the disgusting wings I had the other night. An African American male that works there in hooters was awesome as well. Would I stay here again most likely not. Oh and I did the grease test on the wings \"mild wings\" I put a piece of chicken in a napkin and squeezed it omg you could have use the amount of grease in the napkin to wax the floor. You guys need Gordon Ramsey to help you out with that. So anyways check in was great, food was ok, rude hooter girls didn't like that and the pool girls flirting."

They said the rooms weren't available yet but did lock up my luggage so I was free to roam.\n\nWas assigned a room in the Ocean View tower. Bed was comfortable, no flat screen and the decor, well it's Hooters' knotty pine and tropical prints. The whole place is starting to show some wear. My bathroom, while clean, had a shower/tub leak that looked as though it rotted out the metal door frame bottom - and left a wet spot on the carpet after use (which I didn't catch when 1st moving in.)\n\nThe bottom of the parking garage had a bunch of room furniture stored there so I thinking there may be some renovating going on. Would probably give a 3.5 rating (aside from the shower/tub leak.) Staff is helpful, dealers surly and clients were friendly. OK value if you just need a decent room to crash in and tough to beat the $50 range on a weekend - just 1 city block from Trop & MGM."

She offered no gel or assistance at all. \n\nHowever, I ended up walking over to the Hooters restaurant where I met Krystal! When I say that my time spent was well worth it, this is one of my best restaurant experiences. She made sure I was satisfied with my order, if I wanted anything else, she continued to check on me as good \nwaitresses should. Her customer service was over the top, she was awesome. \n\nRoom Update: 7/9/15\nThe room all summed up that was given to me was horrible! The Manager was not on duty but I will contact him/her. I did however speak with Dinora (Hotel Sup) about my experience and the room. She apologized for the inconvenience and the removed fees that were charged for the room. This hotel should not have a resort fee at all. I try to to find the good in anything and after staying here... I just can't wait to get home and shower. Hopefully if anyone is planning on staying here come after September 2015, they are supposedly renovating.\n\nThe casino part is small. I played for a couple of hours and the employees I encountered on this end we're very polite and great personalities.\n\nI Went down to Hooters restaurant for breakfast and again the staff in the restaurant is awesome!

Luckily my friends planned for us to stay at Hooters, and one word definitely defined my experience: ghetto.\n\nYep... there's nothing special about Hooters honestly, but the real deal-sealer for here is that it was CHEAP, and since we were never really in the rooms, it wasn't a huge issue.  The hotel is located off the strip across from MGM, and parking (like everywhere else in Vegas) is pretty generous.\n\nRooms were small.  There were two queen sized beds for you and a friend to share. Ice and vending machines are available on each floor for your convenience (we definitely had a bath tub of liquor to start).  There is a pool outside that is open 24 hours, but be sure to have a shirt on when you come back in.  The staff doesn't like people who go in and out shirtless.  And another bad part... there is no wireless internet available. (shute, even Motel 6 down the street has wifi!?)\n\nAs for the Casino, it wasn't bad, although the Hooters $100 free play in slots is pretty deceiving.  I blew all of that in 12 rounds, so it is highly unlikely that you'll be making much money.  Although I did learn how to play craps that night!  Dealers were pretty legit.\n\nSo it's ghetto, but cheap.  I can't complain."

Even the shower curtains are dated. \nOnly enough shampoo for one wash and NO bar soap. \nLamp shades have holes in them. TV is dated, even the programming is from the 80's and 90's. \nHallways are pretty quiet in the evening. \nRoom service is another area that's needs a major improvement. I ordered one pancake one egg and two milks for $23.80. It was brought to me in a bag in two 'to go' containers. No salt, pepper, or any other condiments, and food was ice cold by the time I got it which was less than 30 minutes from ordering. The room also lacks a table to eat a meal at while looking at the view of the roof. \nThe guy who brought it up was sketchy and almost wouldn't bring it in the room. \nIf I wasn't here on business and someone else paying for the room, I would move to another hotel. \nAll in all this place is a dump."

They have a pool area with two large pools and conecting outdoor bar.  For those that like to keep in shape and active, the hotel also has a indoor gym with the news workout equipment.  But the best perk is getting the free rewards card and using it to accumulate points which in return can be used to by hooters Mech, or eat free into hooters restraunts"

It was reasonably clean and comfy, however the bed frame was broken and sticking out from under the bed and it cut me. After complaining and doing an incident report we were moved to a room on the 17th floor. This room had more floor space but looked beat up. It was very dirty, part of the wall was broken, and the sink and shower were backed up. Also this room had a coffee maker but no coffee, only sugar and cream packets. Lame. So finally after settling into our second room we got a rewards card for gambling. When we signed up we got a coupon book for a total of 10$ off our meal at Hooters, a 15% coupon for the gift shop, and a couple of gambling related coupons. \n\nThe pool was descent. There was a DJ, beer pong, ping pong, corn hole, a waterfall, and a bar. I was stoked at how cheap the bar was. Vegas charges up the ass for drinks but this bar at the Hooters pool was great. \n\nThe rooms were some of the cheapest on the July 4th weekend and the location is great, hopefully won't need to stay there again though."

She said go eat At Terrible's Cake in the hotel with the same Name.. Its cheap & no frills food. The people I was with didn't like the idea of a restaurant named Terrible's so they suggested Hooters.\n\nI was like okay that's fine, since you cant really mess it up right?\n\nWe get there and we have to sign up for some Hooters Card thingy to get the discounted chicken wings. I'm like okay cool. Then after about 20 minutes later, we are signed up and seated.\n\nI just wanted some wings and a side to suppress this stomach cramps i have been having because of nothing to eat. The wing special they have is for some really cheap amount, i forgot how much it was, like 10 cents or 20 cent wings?\n\nBut here is the catch, you need to buy a Soda, and a minimum purchase of wings. The wording was really complicated but we had to ask the waiter and she explained it to us.\n\nI get wings and some onion rings and a Diet coke. It comes out fairly quickly. I was hella hungry so didn't even bother to assets what i was eating. I just went chowing down.\n\nAfter eating all the minimum order of the wings. We leave the restaurant. But then a little bit after, about 20 minutes or so after eating, my start to get stomach cramps again and had to use the restroom at our hotel.\n\nSeems like I got food poisoning from the Chicken. When I think back about it. the chicken was really cold like it was sitting out side for a while already. I asked my sister about it who also works in the food service industry and she also said she got food poisoning from there.\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I'll pass on Hooters. there is so many better places to eat.\n\nWell there you go, if you want some chicken wings with a side of food poisoning, Hooters for cheap wings is the place you want to be."

You are right next to Tropicana, Excalibur, New York New York, and MGM Grand and the monorail station right next to it.\nIts super close the air port and this place does not break the bank.  \nI find this one small enough to enjoy and not big enough that you lose your way when you get separated from your friends."

That answer gets you bonus points. \n\nThis review is for the Hooters restaurant and Casino. I did not stay in a room. Nor would I, because the wood paneling and the bright orange was just too much! I imagine this elegant motif carries itself through to the rooms. Much much too demure a place for me to handle staying there. \n\nHooters remains true to their motto. They stay tacky. And they own it, which is why I actually like it. The waitresses still walk around with their logo tank tops, nylon covered ass cheeks, LA Gear tennis shoes and tube socks. It comforts me to know that I experience Hooters the same way patrons did when the place first opened.\n\nI like their wings and fried pickles, although I will admit, the food here, no matter the location, is always mediocre. Hooters keeps thier expectations low so you don't have to. Just kidding, you do. I do love the cheap beer and smorgasbord of different shapes and sizes of boobies on their best push up game.

We have always known its not a 5 star hotel (Hotwire rates it a \"3\"... really?!) and never expected it to be, but we kept coming back because we really like the location - right near all the other big, popular casinos , how easy it is to get to your rooms, and loads of free parking. Realistically, it should now be 1 1/2 star rating.  Here's why - the air quality in the rooms is horrid, the bed smelled bad, the bed sheets smelled nasty, the carpet is stained and smells moldy.  When you wake up in the morning be warned -  you'll have a bunch of yuck in your throat.  \n\nMaybe I'm being too harsh, a group of homeless people liked it enough to set up camp on the northeast corner.  They were nice - I mean the one passed out on the only sidewalk to get anywhere from Hooters moved out of the way quick enough when asked.  \n\nThe sidewalk (past the homeless people) you'll discover a gauntlet of trash, pee, hundreds of nasty cans, bottles, dirt, clothes, shoes, and food.  I know its not Hooter's responsibility to monitor this, but common sense should kick in here - it's THE ONLY SIDEWALK OUT and if I were in charge I'd send my own people there to clean up the trash and steam clean the sidewalk.  It would take 2 hours at the most.  Your guests use this sidewalk so its pretty much your porch and its terrible to have to walk thru this every time you want to go.\n\nShame on you Hooter's!"

I've been \"chosen\" to stay at this hotel several times over the years, simply because it's one of the cheapest hotels in Vegas that's still in close proximity to The Strip.  It's definitely a lower-end hotel, similar to the ones you'd find in Downtown Las Vegas.  If there is any need for you to project a sense of wealth or affluence, this isn't the hotel for you.  If you need a hotel with clean rooms and a reasonably nice casino that is in close proximity to even nice hotels with far better casinos, this is the place for you.  \n\nThe last time I stayed here, I had a room on the 9th floor.  It was a very clean room with comfortable beds.  Depending on what side of the building your room is located, you're either going to have a view of the MGM Grand to the North of you, just across the street, or a view of the pool area and the City of Henderson way off in the distance to the South.  The wifi connection was easy to pick up.  I don't like hotel rooms where even the quickest of showers will cause the bathroom to turn into a giant steamy mess, and this is exactly what it's like here.  You can tell that the wallpaper and the paint in the bathroom has had to endure the brunt of this constant steam.  \n\nThe casino itself is very basic.  There aren't a huge variety of slot machines and table games.  The advertise $5 blackjack tables, but there will likely be only one of these tables in operation at any given time.  If you like the whole scene at Hooters restaurants, you'll like the scene in this casino.  If you're looking for the opulent side of Las Vegas, you won't like it.  \n\nI think I paid $25 for one night in this hotel, which is a great bargain for this hotel.  I gave this hotel three stars instead of two because the quality of the hotel pretty much matches the price.  I've stayed at much worse places than this in Las Vegas and paid much more.  I'd say this is the best hotel in Las Vegas for this price range."

The noise level was kept to a minimum.The rooms just look like your typical motel rooms. Don't expect it to look like the Bellagio or Venetian. If u rather save your money on other extravagance in LV. Then the Hooters is just the right place for u. Even family with kids will have a blast. There is a huge outdoor pool and the Excalibur with lots of kids activites is just minutes walk! And for the big boys, the gawking at Hooters girls will make their time fly by in Vegas. They also offer free breakfast with a minimum 2 nights stay. I haven't get a chance to try the 24 hrs world famous Hooters restaurant yet! :( I will definitely give it a YELP next time I am there. It beats at staying in any far off the strip motels where the homeless and hookers roam. And the bed bugs are the size of raisins. Maybe they are not bed bugs after all. Yike!"

Like any typical hotels in Vegas, it's filled with games & slot machines everywhere & even the cashiers were trying to hustle us for room money saying we reserved 5 rooms instead of 3 & tried to make us pay more so they can fill up their rooms. Big no no so I'm subtracting a star from their original 3 stars. The bell boy was helpful during our initial arrival there...the hotel wasn't too close or too far from the strip bit it did take a bit of a walk to get there.\n\nThe hotel room itself was neat and didn't give me rashes like the low end motels I've been to so that's a good sign. Toilet flushed slow because we were on the 18th floor but it's whatever...the view was mediocre & it's ironic how they named it \"Ocean View\" when all we see are the pools below & \"Bay View\" when it's the view of the strip itself...not much of a \"view\" if you ask me.\n\nThe bed was comfy to sleep in and I did get good night sleep there. A/C runs smoothly and saved our asses from the Nevada heat. Other than it being the Hooters Hotel it was just pretty much resembling your typical Hooters restaurant because the waitresses there wear their Hooters uniform and services you as they would at their own restaurant. Nothing too out of the extraordinary & it's definitely a good alternative if you want a cheaper hotel to stay at in Vegas."

I wanted to gamble for cheap and since MGM is a bit higher, I walked over to Hooters.  \n\nThey don't have a great location so they make up for that with $5 craps and blackjack tables.  That's more in my range for table games.  I am also a fan of Hooters wings so I always come to the restaurant to eat.\n\nThe service is pretty nice and we were even comped a pitcher of beer because they had originally brought us the wrong one.  The restaurant window side has a view of a pool so you can get some entertainment there.\n\nNice, beautiful workers at the restaurant and also the tables games have pretty nice dealers for cheap prices.

Plus there were enough outlets for everything. The casino was also pretty cool. I didn't get to sign up for the players card but I heard its a great deal.

It's a regular 'ol casino/hotel w/ nothing more than hard working ladies taking care of their customers. Hotel is SMALL (which is good): everything is accessible without having to run around a maze of slot machines/shops to find a bathroom. It's easy to navigate & clean. It's DATED: meaning it's not fancy/modern. Which is TOTALLY fine with me, especially for the affordability! What I was not a fan of is the elevators: they are in dire need of repairs. We were given a 15th floor room (very nice view of the mountains in the distance & the pool below). 1 of the times in which i was in the elevator going up, it dropped by a few feet. SCARED ME TO DEATH! I avoided that elevator from then on out and told the hotel people about the incident. Hopefully they will fix/update the machinery soon, 'cause the weird noises are a sure sign of worse things to come! Besides this: the hotel is great! Unbeatable location if you are looking to be close to the south end of the strip. The MGM (which is a billion times more expensive per night) is directly across the street. Granted, the MGM has more amenities, but if you are just looking for a clean/comfortable place to sleep while in vegas, without spending all of your budget on the hotel room, stay at Hooters. (PS: the pool seems nice. i didn't get to use it since this was a 48 hour business trip at the beginning of march 2014 but i would have used it if i had had a chance)."

There's no excuse for having a bed in a casino right off the strip where it looks like a 400 pounder died and sat for weeks. No excuse. This a place where people sleep, I should have never had to say anything in the first place. Not really sure why anyone would say the casino waitresses are good. The ones I've dealt with walk around like they are above everyone else. Sorry, but your shit still stinks no matter how low you stoop to get tips. The \"restaurant\" needs to focus on serving real food instead of passing off a lettuce sandwich with a few pieces of store bought lunch meat as a \"Club Sandwich\". The food is gross, you can tell the quality is bad when you're up all night because you can't stop burping. I will never stay in this establishment again, nor will I ever eat in a Hooters or recommend them to anyone I know(funny, I never actually ate at one before this trip). I am extremely disappointed in this company, and expected at least a 3 star experience. Instead, I've been given a -1 star experience, right off the strip that has soured my first vegas experience.

I have found that it is generally clean and the staff is helpful.   The beds are comfortable, the water pressure is ok and the AC works.  I don't know that I'd bring my wife there but, it's ok for traveling alone.  You really can't ask for much more than that at the prices that they charge.  \n\nThe location is great: directly across the street from the MGM Grand,  next door to the Flamingo and maybe a 5 minute walk to the strip.  \n\nI agree with the previous reviews about the parking garage.  It really is a dump.  However, there is an ample sized parking lot and I never had a problem finding a space.  \n\nI decided not to stay there during my most recent visit to Vegas as they filed chapter 11 bankruptcy in early August.

It might have been the lack of 10 other smelly drunk people around.\n\nThe room:\n- The toilet broke the very first time it was used.\n\n- On the back of our door, written in permanent marker read \"I'M WATCHING YOU :)\"  uh.\n\n- Mysterious basketball-sized red stain in the corner of the room.\n\n- They actually have a little ad thing on the dresser between the beds that starts out in big print, \"Do you REALLY need clean sheets.....?\" followed by a description about how you shouldn't request to have clean sheets unless you really, really need them. As if any hotel's sheets aren't disgusting and questionable enough, the classy establishment that is Hooters is asking me to drunkenly pass out on some previously sexed-up vomit bed? Pass. (I ended up doing it anyway)\n\n-NO HOOTERS STATIONARY. Wtf am I supposed to steal for a souvenier? I just want a Hooters pen, god.\n\nThe actual hotel:\n- The elevator is the scariest elevator I've ever been on. And smells of burning rubber. And sounds like you're about to die. Squeeling elevator noises and shaking = bad.\n\n- I got so lost just trying to get the fuck out of there and onto the strip.\n\n- I didn't eat at the restaurant, but some of our friends did and said it was disgusting (coming from growing young dudes who will eat anything)\n\n- The Hooters girls don't have hooters. I'm a girl and even I was a little appauled by this. They're just right-outta-high-school uggos that need a job. Lame. Have some dignity and get a boob job.\n\n-Really creepy old men everywhere. Like, EVERYWHERE.\n\nSo yeah. No thanks, Hooters. No thanks."

Now let me start off by saying.....I am NOT one of those picky people who complain over the slightest  things..... but JEEZ! This place REEKED of smoke (yes i am aware that it is a casino) but even my hair reeked from staying in this room. The electrical outlets appeared to be hanging off the wall and i was afraid I'd electrocute myself if I attempted to charge my phone. During my shower I was standing in a little more than ankle deep water and washing my face was almost going to cause an overflow in the sink (drainage problems). The bedsheets, or lack there of were horrible. I slept with only the comforter since the bed didn't come with any sheets or a blanket. The filling in the comforter was matted and shoved to one end of the comforter....therefore.....I guess it became a sheet. Ha! My parents also stayed in a room one floor below us and told us they too had issues with the shower and sink......and found a few spiders hanging out with them. (two were spinning webs in the tub). I could go on about the decor, the rude staff, the dirty elevator.......but whatever. Point is, Only stay if you absolutely can't afford to spend a few more bucks elsewhere or if your a drunk frat boy just needing a place to crash.......in little more than a sheet."

It was a memorable stay but for all the wrong reasons. I got there early and was allowed to go to my room earlier than the 4pm check-in time.SO that was nice. However I noticed things after looking around that were not the best, Room 526 had a huge seam in the carpet that shows it needs replacing as well in the far corner of the room it looked as if someone deficated in the corner was wiped up not actually cleaned. The bathroom looked to have tile missing around the toilet.\n\nBeyond that my food and beverage experience was equally disappointing. Seeing as this was the basis for the company it really saddened and quite frankly made me angry. First off on Thursday at midnite...Primetime for casinoes, there were 2 servers for the casino floor. 2 SERVERS!! The tables were full and the back where the machines were while not as packed still had people there. At the next table there were guys complaining receiving drinks for an hour!! The girls were being yelled by the patrons because of slow orders. Even one of the pit supervisors acknowledged that they had to wait that long. THAT IS INEXCUSABLE!!! I never got my drink and told the bartender that I was leaving to go to the Tropicana to play and maybe get a drink or two.That was Thursday.\n\nFriday night the drink situation was better but still could be improved. However when I decided to get a late night bite and go to the restaurant, I took a spot at the bar. I sat there checked out the menu and figured someone would be along to get the order. The couple next to me had finished and one the bartenders gave them their check, it got paid and the bartender went on her merry way. Meanwhile I am still sitting there not being served. After 10 minutes of waiting at a half full bar, I am finally acknowledged by a busser, I ask the busser for a manager and explain to the manager the situation of my waiting and his only solution was to do a drink order. Not happy and that was Friday.\n\nOn Saturday. I go and find out I have enough points for a meal so I decided to try again and get food. Get sat and acknowledged this time, but this time I am near a bussing/drink station. The staff was going back and forth regarding a lack of coffee available. AT 9AM!! And what I was hearing was not fun as both the bussers and waitresses were giving major attitude towards each other.\n\nI myself am in the travel industry and am in a leadership position. I know when my agents go out to deal with the public that they are on stage at all times. And if there is a breakdown its not only a reflection on them but the company they represent. You have a chance to save your image and save business by addressing these issues. As far as I am concerned even though I am a budget minded consumer, I will add to my budget if it means no longer staying at your property,"

Once inside the casino, it was filled with old white men, JUST men! and a few 60 something year old cocktail waitress'.

We ordered our food, 10 min go by....20 min go by....30 MINUTES go by.....ummm where the fuck is my burger? i asked my server what happened to our order, and she says \"oh, umm you have to wait, the food always takes a long time\" (we ordered a burger and a salad, nothing more!) after 40 minutes, i told her to cancel our order and close our beer tab.

He arranged for a block of rooms at the Hooters right across the street, so I had no choice. Let's not fool anyone. Hooters is no 4/5-star hotel, but if you're looking for a cheap alternative to the ritzier hotels on the strip, then Hooters ain't so bad. The location's great -- right near all the action (I think... who knows? Like I said, I'm not a huge Vegas person.)\n\nAs for the gambling... well, I don't really gamble, but I did watch my friend turn 60 bucks on a craps table into much more, so that's good. I spotted one of the poker dealers slightly struggle while dealing. Hmm... they may want to hire professional dealers and not just Hooters waitresses, which brings me to ---\n\nThe Hooters Restaurant at the hotel\n\nI've had the not so distinct pleasure of visiting a few Hooters restaurants in 2 states. While they're not known for their culinary prowess, they at least have nice eye candy. Not in Vegas of all places. We had an unattractive, pregnant server who was fortunately not in typical Hooters garb. She was also a shitty, unattentive waitress. The place was not crowded, yet she barely visited our table to ask how everything was or refill our drinks.\n\nSurprisingly, the maids at the hotel were much friendlier. They would always say hello whenever I'd walk by. I thought this was very nice considering they're probably making slightly less than minimum wage.\n\nThe rooms -- they're not so grand, but they're decent enough.\n\nAll in all, this is a decent place to stay if you want to save some money and be close to hotels like the MGM, NY/NY, etc."

There were lots of poor reviews for reasons mentioned more than once and it made me really apprehensive about my stay. Because my reservation was unrefundable, I decided to give it a shot. We were greeted by very friendly staff, the gentleman checking us in made us really feel at home. The restaurant was open 24 hours along with the sundry shop, the pool was private and beautiful. There was also a nice little fitness center. There were some downfalls as far as the actual shape of the hotel, due to how old it is, but it was a small sacrifice to have privacy and low maintenance neighbors. Nothing is more annoying then having a million eyes on you all the time to make sure that we aren't the \"reckless group of hooligans in Vegas that will tear the room apart\". The staff was very relaxed and friendly from the guy at the door to the cleaning lady, to the waitresses and bartenders and the casino floor staff as well. The dealers were excited to make us some money, and was nice to see a lot of them had been there for years. There was a sweet Asian lady working the floor and always reminding us to use our rewards card which was really easy to use at all the slot machines and tables. We got a few nights free dinner, a deck of cards and a t shirt! All in all it wasn't luxurious, but it was a great experience and was a great deal for being on the strip. I will definitely be back again! Until next time Hooters!"

As a disabled guest I asked on booking for a room that would be easy to get to i.e that I wouldn't have far to walk from the parking lot to my room: not only did they put me in the room FARTHEST from the elevators, the parking garage has been closed off and the valets have 'claimed' some of the disabled person's parking spaces for their own purposes (not letting disabled guests use them) and we had to park in a regular space (so I had great difficulty getting out of the car not being able to fully open the door) which was so far from the nearest elevator that I was in much more pain than usual by the time I reached the room. This parking situation also means that any disabled people having to use the rear parking lot will have to use the rear door which is very difficult to open (if you have a physical disability) and have to negotiate their way around stools and tables in the bar that you have to go through in order to get to the main areas (anywhere other than the bar actually). Half the staff seem to be on a kind of 'automatic pilot' so if you ask them anything more complicated than, \"How do I get to my room?\" you get a vague response that's not helpful at all. Thankfully we did come across a couple of pleasant staff who initially looked rather depressed but responded well given a friendly greeting. I've been daft enough to stay here on three separate occasions now and I've had it with this hotel, I'd rather stay at a Super 8! Yes it's a bit cheaper than the strip hotels but not so much to make up for the downsides, especially after they add the ridiculous resort fee! If you need to save money, consider one of the motels just off the strip (Travelodge, Motel 6, Super 8, La Quinta etc)."

We'd think of something we needed, then it was like she read our minds, and two minutes later it was on our table the next time she stopped by to check up on us. No matter what it was, straws, forks, plates, to-go boxes, the whole nine yards, we didn't have to ask for a thing. even the bartender checked up on us a couple times, and asked if we needed anything, but there Tammy was right behind her with whatever we needed.

By the end of the exchange, she even started raise her voice.\n\nWho gave these women jobs in hospitality? And how are they able to keep it? They obviously have absolute no idea what hospitality is...The employee even gave speeches of how grateful we should be that she is willing to deal with us. \n\nFinally after a 1hr and 20 mins, the system was up. They try to charge us with early check-in fee and hotel resort fee. If you make a customer wait a 1hr and 20 mins at least to take off the resort fee or early check in fee! \n\nOverall, no matter how affordable this hotel is the trouble & rudeness that comes along with it is not worth it. Seriously, all that time, money, and taking attitude from the employee just to stay at a dirty hotel? And no apologizes where given at any moment of my interaction with them. Just dirty glances between the employes with a smirk on their face."

Ask waitress 30 min later abt order..keep very very very low expectations coming here and maybe you'll enjoy yourself. Sadly tho place kills it for all hooters I'll never go back to the ones near home either. Maybe some general anger somewhere will figure it out and make it better.

            "review": "When you think of Las Vegas, you think of bigger and over-the-top, but prepare yourself for disappointment upon entering the Hooters Restaurant in the Hooters Casino.  To put it best: it's an ordinary Hooters restaurant that happens to be in Vegas, as opposed to being the \"Vegas Hooters.\"  Expect your typical Hooters experience but in a drearier setting because the Hooters Casino is a bit dingy, and with so many other places to visit for cheap greasy food this place is usually very quiet.\n\nIn my opinion, Hooters should consider putting more money into the location and making it a Vegas destination.  There are other places with better looking waitresses and cheap food/drinks, so why limit one's self to this hole in the wall location?  In Vegas, there are too many options for attractive waitresses to be stuck at this place - that's the feeling that I got during my visits.  There is nothing wrong with the place and it is your typical Hooters experience, but shouldn't the expectations be higher in Vegas?  \n\nI have been to several Hooters restaurants throughout California, and have been to the Vegas location 3-4 times.  I actually stayed at the hotel on one occasion during a last minute Vegas trip when my usual places were booked, so I have a thorough perspective of the hotel, bar, casino, and restaurant.  The Vegas Hooters isn't bad but it really can't compete with the other Vegas options.  The casino and bar area is sad and depressing, but the rooms are super cheap and better than the local roach motels.  \n\nI'm a guy that likes wings, beers, and stealing glances at the waitresses, but in Vegas, there are so many nicer places for the same cost, that I can't really recommend the restaurant unless you've never been to a Hooters restaurant before.  It's not bad, but there is no energy and the vibe is nonexistent.  This location is average when compared to other Hooters locations, but less than average when compared to other options in the area."

I asked to speak to a manager and was told none were available and I would be contacted 2 days later and still no manager. I was charged 2x's for my rooms.

Located inside the Hooters hotel, it's located in the very back of the first floor of the casino.\n\nThe restaurant has that familiar wood paneling look with plenty of TVs all around to check out the game.  We got here around 3ish so we had no problems getting seats.  We got our menu and it's your typical bar and grill items here, so we're talking about burgers, sandwiches, strip steaks, chicken, and of course their most popular food item, Wings.\n\nWe decided to get a couple rounds of beer and also some wings and their chili cheese fries.  The service was a bit slow, but when we got our food I have to say they were generous.  The wings were pretty big and we got a big pile of chili cheese fries.\n\nI don't know how they cook their wings, but have to say I always thought Hooters had some of the best wings out there and this has lived up to it's reputation.  Nice juicy wings with a crispy out side.  The fries here were also very good.  Plenty of chili with nice chunks of meat with a ton of cheese just made for good greasy junk food to watch college football.\n\nThe eye candy here wasn't quite what we were hoping for.  When you think of Vegas and Hooters, you have a certain image in your mind.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations we were hoping for.  But no matter, the food and the college football games were still good.\n\nAs to ratings, to be honest, the Las Vegas Hooters is really no different than any other Hooters I've been too.  I wasn't expecting the Sapphire or something, but was hoping for just a little bit more \"Las Vegas\" to it.  Overall, the food hit the spot and the wings were good but honestly I wouldn't go out of my way to coming here when you will get the same experience at any other Hooters restaurant across the country.  Overall, just average and a 3 star rating."

We were only passing thru Vegas as we traveled from Sequoia National park to Zion National park. We used Hotwire and skipped the review thinking Hotwire would've screened this hotel.  Well I will say that this place should not even be able to rent rooms.  The edges of the tub was disgusting and the carpet smelled like cigarette and marijuana smoke combined.  The sliding doors to the balcony were a safety hazard and the beds were like army cots (I'm an Army Vet).  This place should be condemned and then perhaps renovated by a super rich pool of investors.  Terrible.  Like I said I'm embarrassed that we even stayed there.  FML"

Arrived very early on Friday morning, had a delicious bargain breakfast at the The Mad Onion located on the casino floor next to the bar. We checked in and found the room to be OK, clean, the bathroom could use a little update.. The casino is very small. We played some roulette, very friendly table host. My husband and I didn't have great expectations for our stay but did find our stay quite comfy. We did enjoy a late night dip in the jacuzzi, the crowd was a bit \"sketchy\" but not too uncomfortable, the jacuzzi did have a bit too much clorine, made my eyes burn a bit. All in all this hotel is economical and decent.  If your on a budget and want to stay near the south end of the strip, this maybe the hotel for you."

When I get to my room, turns out the balcony door had no lock or bar on it, so I'm afraid to get a good nights sleep. Eventually after contacting the front desk, the maintenance man to fix it with a screw driver. There was a nice pool area with a water fall which I enjoyed. It's located at the south end of the strip across the street from the MGM Grand hotel. If you are planning to catch the Monorail inside of the MGM Grand you will have to cross over the busy street to do so. I rate this a 3 overall."

And after midnight at the Dan Marino restaurant, they have AWESOME chicken wing deals... I'm talking like.. 10 cent chicken wings or something like that (after midnight my memory was a lil blurry :) And it is NOT that far from the strip! It's right across from MGM, right next to the Tropicana and minutes away from the Luxor. Everyone knows you gotta walk in Vegas no matter where you stay. Stop being lazy! \n\nThe rooms were perfect... King size bed, very comfy. We stayed in the the bungalo. Pool side view... What more could you ask for? And the pool is beautiful! TRY THE NIPPER'S JUICE IT IS DELICIOUUUSSS! I had a WONDERFUL time staying here... I would stay here again and again and again... Cheap rooms = more money to waste away gambling. PERFECT!\n\nThe staff was great to us... They held our luggage all day while we walked around and waited for check in. If you're someone who doesn't have money spewing out of their wallets, then stay here.. save money, and enjoy yourself, I know we did!  Everyone leaving these reviews sound like snooty people. I mean honestly.. You would think their were bugs and dirty condoms left in their rooms... GET OVER YOURSELVES! Vegas is all about EATING, DRINKING and GAMBLING. Hooters has it all...

Yes, what I am paying per night is not much compared to other hotels nearby, but the first non-smoking room we were given smelled like an ash tray and had no toilet paper.  Front desk first time said they couldn't switch rooms since sold out.  Went back again and told them that since the room smelled like an ash tray, we would be looking for a new hotel and I assumed I could get ALL my money back.  This person then found us a new room, which was nice.\n\nSo first impression was not good (0 or 1 star).  Second person at Registration was nice and found us a new room, and second impression is that it is a nice room (3 stars).\n\nAveraged it out to 2 stars.  It might be a craps shoot to get a good room.\n\nUpdate:  A couple of things.  One day, they only half cleaned the room.  Only made one bed, and didn't give us fresh towels, though we still had a couple of unused towels from the previous day.\n\nWould I stay here again?  Yes.  It probably would not be my first choice, but the convenience and the price are hard to pass up.  You just have to remember that you are not staying at a high priced hotel.  For what it is worth, we know a couple that stayed at the MGM for 3x the price we paid, and their room was very, very small, and though there was a door on the toilet, there was no door to the bathroom and they said that you could hear everything.  At least that was not the case at Hooter's Casino & Hotel."

This time we get to our room and discover there is no fridge in the room. They tell us none of the rooms have them and they are $25 dollars  day to rent (very very small fridges mind you). For an 11 night stay thats $275 dollars to rent a less than 2 cubic foot fridge. Pretty ridiculous. We happened to drive so we went down to walmart and bought a 3 cubic foot one for less than $100, which we can now take home with us. The $13 dollar a day 'resort fee' which supposedly includes internet includes only one internet connection per room (we have two laptops) and the cord extends only about 6 inches so sitting at the desk is the only option if you want to use it. Connection speed is very slow. We complained and they sent someone to bring us another cord who begrudgingly told us it would be very very slow bc the connection is already terrible. When room service cleaned they did not take the used coffee k-cup form the machine and decided not to make our bed at all because we had one of our own blankets on top of it. (there are no comforters on the beds only a very thin blanket and sheets. We called to order room service and after failing to be connected 2 times they told us the front desk would have the restaurant call us. Never Happened. Called front desk 2 more times before finally being connected to the hooters restaurant manager who then proceeded to tell us they would not remove the gratuity charge (which is mandatory and in addition to a $2 service charge) even though it had taken us over half an hour just to get our order in. We would have gone down and picked it up ourselves but kept being assured they would call us. We called to get some extra coffee cups for the room since we had not had room service that day and had used ours and they told us they charge for them. They then called us back and brought some up for free. They must have thought we wanted k-cups for the keurig in the room.(Which whould have been free regardless since we did not get the ones we would have recieved had we had the room cleaned that day). The hotel room is okay and the pool area is nice. Food at the restaurant is decent. The mad onion no longer offers a breakfast buffet. And all of the service numbers connect you to the same person which is pretty annoying. Overall the hotel itself may be a three or three and a half star but the service is terrible. They don't seem to care at all about their customers (even though we were on a long trip which is well over the average stay at a vegas hotel). Will not be coming back. Which is a shame because last time we really did have a good time. Oh and we were in a smoking room but had to call and request ashtrays. Next time i'll just ash on the floor like all the people before us obviously have.\n\nFelt I should add to this review that we woke up this morning (Memorial Day weekend) to not having any running water. When we called the desk the girl told us it was off, did not apologize and then hung up the phone on us. This hotel is never going to succeed until they teach their staff to treat guests with respect."

Also, they have recreated a mid west style bar where you can sit all night with cheap beers watching sports, playing video golf and placing bets at sports book 10 feet away. (FINALLY SOME ONE GETS IT!)\n\nPOOL AREA:  Open 24/7, No BS security (as long as you use common sense and aren't a jackass).  Down to earth staff, & guests.\n\nBEDS!: VERY COMFORTABLE MATTRESS.

They consider it a restaurant and no $1.50 beers. Plus you have to be seated for food, & although I love me some HOOTERS grub. This place is off the mark. STAY AWAY FROM PORCH DOGS.\n\nRESERVATIONS: Great people, somewhat good prices; but you really have to look closely at $ on check in / out. I found a pricing error  (On line Summer of Choices promo pricing of $59.00 for Friday July 8, 2011. Was charged $99. I brought this to the check in gal's attention.

It's like the girls see me with another women and just assume I don't deserve decent service from them. It takes well over 10min before someone ask if we want any drinks, then if we're lucky we get at least one refill after our cups have been empty for half an hr. We place our orders and after we are served we won't see our waitress till it's time for the check. It's frustrating cause I've been to hooters many times with my friends and we get spot on service but the times I wanna take the wife with me I might as well not even bother and go someplace else if I want decent service."

The sheets had a hole and tear in them, the bathroom had a crack on the floor and the toilet had a quirk that you had to hold down the lever for it to flush. The bed and pillows were okay. At least there was A/C!\n\nThe variety of pools was good. It seemed like Goldilocks. One with the waterfall was freezing, another one closest to the entrance was cold, and the last one closest to the bar was regular temperature. The waterfall was a nice touch, though. I like that they have two jacuzzis.\n\nThe worse thing is that I thought this hotel was supposed to be new!? It seemed like they took over an old crappy hotel. The elevator was ugly and bad, only one of them worked the whole time. Worst of all, no A/C in the elevator!\n\nThe casino was very small, but all of the dealers and waitresses I had were nice. This casino is too far from the center of the strip, I will definitely consider a closer hotel."

We stayed here in 2011 and came back in 2014, but the rooms in this hotel are so outdated and poorly maintained. The AC/heater mounted on the walls of our room sounds like a truck and we had to get up in the middle of the night to turn it off. We were exhausted for days until we moved to the Venetian. The bathtub has multiple dents and won't drain any water. Only half the water makes it to the shower head; the rest runs from the tub tap.  The anti-slip mat was so filthy I didn't even want to touch it. All of the above, the bathroom floor between the tub and the toilet is covered in sticky yellow gunk, which I think could be removed but they just didn't care to.  Blow dryer was broken and almost caught on fire when turned on. Even the posters in elevators were vandalized and the management didn't seem to mind it at all.  I wish I took a picture but we couldn't stand it any longer and left in such a hurry. \n\nSo in conclusion. If you are absolutely broke but want to stay close to the strip, go to hooters. But if you have just a little bit money to spend on your vacation, and you want to have a good memory of your stay in Vegas, go to another hotel. Nothing on the strip can be worse than this place."

What is funny is I was here to see Todd Paul's show (completely underrated and the best value on Vegas right now), and I was hungry and had no time to go across to MGM and find something better.  Hooters, was really the only choice to go except for the Mad Onion, which had horrible reviews so I was scared to go there.  So here I was, embarrassed to be waiting in line to try supposedly good wings.\n\nI ordered 10 wings hot, but weren't in the slightest bit hot and were breaded, a big no no with me.  I didn't find out until after that I could have gotten them without the breading, but oh well.  They weren't that good.  The chicken itself was moist and would have been great if it had been naked and with an actual hot sauce.  They charge you extra for blue cheese which is in a small prepackaged container (99 cents), and for celery (79 cents).  However, the most pleasant aspect of this meal was the celery as it was the freshest, most delicious, and huge portion of celery I have had served with wings.  I loved the celery so much I had them take away the wings and I devoured the entire plate of that good crunchy healthy celery.\n\nAlso had the curly fries which were good.  I don't normally eat curly fries because they have seasoned salt on them but I liked these.  Husband had a grilled hot dog that didn't seem grilled and cheese sticks that he said were decent.  \n\nWould we go here again?  Doubtful, but we will be back in the casino to see Todd Paul.  I was utterly floored when next to us there was a table with a woman who was celebrating her birthday with her husband there and two friends.  I'm guessing it was the husband's idea to go there.  My husband saw it and said, \"If I take you here for your birthday you have my permission to divorce me.\""

Check in and out was easy but that is were I will stop for good remarks.  I was housed on the 9th floor with a view of the Vegas Strip with a room that had a 1 foot by 4 feet long balcony.  The first thing I smelled when getting off the elevator on the way to my room was a mixture of marijuana and sewage (I swear they had a broken toilet pipe on this floor).  Once in the room their was no fridge where I could store my kids formula (one was provided at a charge which was waved after my complaining). We found blood stains on the bed, stains on the bath tub, the bathroom in this room were just \"YUCKY\".  I stayed in this room for two days out of my week long stay in Las Vegas.  I do not recommend this hotel casino to anyone, if you could afford this place you could afford to stay at a Motel 6, which is located across the street from this hotel and casino, and chances are it is in better sanitary conditions then the HOOTERS Casino Hotel .  I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott sure they didn't have gambling on site but they did provide a shuttle service that took their guest from their location to the Mandalay Bay and it ran every 30min up until 1am daily."

Boy oh Boy where do I even begin... \n\nAs this was the first time to Vegas for my friend and I, I did a tremendous amount of research on the lodging options. After heavy consideration we settled on Hooters, because of the ultra cheap price... I will admit that the reviews I read on the place had me worried, but honestly how much time do you spend in the hotel? \n\nHaving that been said let's get down to business...\n\nBefore I slam these people let me discuss the positives. \n\nFor starters the 1.50$ Bud/Bud light 24/7 was a great deal (honestly that is what sealed the deal on whether or not we stayed there).\n\nThe rates really are dirt cheap, you'll be hard pressed to find anywhere that close to that strip any cheaper.  \n\n25 cent wings from 12am-6am. Who can say no to that? \n\nSign up for the Hooters reward card, and you get 200$ in free slot play (promotional only slot area, at 10$ per spin), free steak dinner at Mad Onion (with purchase of 1.50$ beverage per person, and with 1.50$ charge for any add-ons IE. salad, toppings for your potato, onions and mushrooms (which were awful))  \n\nI think that about sums it up for the positives at this place....\n\nNegatives.\n\nThe Bathroom was kinda nasty.. The tile, and fixtures were old and grimey. \n\nThe AC did little to nothing in our room...\n\nNo AC in the hallways, stupid hot walking to/from the room. \n\nExcruciatingly long check in/ check out times.\n\nI noticed the painting on the elevator door was peeling off, and they were just like \"fuck it... let's not fix it\" \n\nThe painting in our room was peeled off the canvas... Noticing a reoccurring theme here. \n\nI'm not one to harp on the attractiveness of staff, but the Hooters girls were less than stellar in the department. I go to Hooters for the wings anyways, but for others that may/may not be a big deal. \n\n\nIn all fairness I will say there was a noticeable difference in service between daytime and late hours at this place. \n\nI've noticed something in common with most reviews on this place, people are mentioning the fact that the waitresses/staff are very rude to patrons. Very true! Two stories to share about this one.\n\n1. About 5:40am my friend and I walk into the Mad Onion looking to sign up for the VIP card (so we can get the 25 cent wings) nobody was in line, and the restaurant has less than 10 people inside. The hostess \"Crystal\" Ignored us for a good 3-4 minutes as she did whatever it was that she was doing behind the counter. Not a single glance... Nothing. When she finally graced us with her presence, she informed us that the person responsible for registering people for the VIP card was on break, and would be back in about 10-15min (25 cent wings end at 6am) and we should just hang around and keep checking back for this person.... \nCome to find out from a bartender NOT the hostess, the VIP person already left for the night. Sorry no 25 cent wings for you. \n\n2. Mad Onion (again) around 3:30am. Crystal seemed to be in a better mood this time around....\n\nWhile waiting in line to get a seat (we decided to secure a VIP card for the cheap wings earlier in the day) we notice a large amount of people just walking past the line, and heading into the restaurant. My friend decides to inquire about what is going on at the hostess desk. He asked \"What is going on?\" (very calm, very collected,) and a gentleman behind the host desk (doing VIP card registration I think) simply responded with \"I'm not affiliated with the restaurant.\" \n\nAfter about half an hour wait we get sat. (Be aware that with about all the promotional specials offered, you have to buy a 1.50$ drink (alcoholic/non alcoholic) in order to receive the offer.) I order 20 spicy, Bud Light (in order to satisfy the drink req.),  2 blue cheese cups (1.00$ each), and an order of fries my friend follows suit but without the fries. \n\nFood arrives, all but my fries... No problem, server said she would have them right out. Fries never came out?!?!? When it came time for the check, we politely reminded her not to charge me for the fries because we never got them. She scoffed at us and stormed off! REALLY?!? \n\nWe compare checks, and notice that my friends bill is higher than mine. He asked for a to go box, and was charged for the box 1.50$ and they charged him again for the wings he didn't finish 2.50$! \n\nAt this point we are fuming! How are you going to charge someone twice for food already ordered? It was as if he was leasing the wings w/ the option to buy if he chose to take them off premises... LOL \n\nNeedless to say a major scene ensued, and they finally took the charge off. \n\n\nThat is all I care to write about this place... \n\nWhile I plan on going back to Vegas very soon, I will NEVER stay at this place again!\n\n2 stars for the 1.50$ bud, and the shot at getting 25 cent wings. \n\npeace"

Vegas served as the launch pad for our 5 day Southwest \"tour,\" so when booking our Vegas hotel the day-of we weren't exactly worried about splurging for a Bellagio experience.  When we scrolled across Hooters shocking $42 ticket price, giggled for a moment and then said \"what the hell.\"  We were feeling so fancy, we splurged for the tower room for an extra five bucks.\n\nThe saying \"wine on a beer budget\" comes to mind when I decided upon my star rating for this hotel.  For $42, my top concern was two things: decent location and clean rooms. And ya know what? Hooters did a pretty darn good job in both categories. The hotel is located right at the end of the strip across from MGM, New York New York and Excalibur. The room isn't anything fancy - ha, in fact it has a few (definitely tacky) touches of Hooters with orange lampshades, knotty pine wood trim and Hooters artwork (not tatas; however, this would be more entertaining, but a sketch of a Hooters restaurant). \n\nThe location is very easy to find off highway 15/Tropicana Avenue. Parking is free and plentiful.  There are times when I look for a hotel that is bubbling over with character and others when the hotel is serving one purpose: safe/clean place to rest my head. Vegas may not be my cup of tea, but Hooters will most likely serve as my launch pad the next time I'm here. Hard to beat $42 for the tackiest hotel in town."

Not only do the elevators from the parking garage to the hotel rattle and nasty, but the elevators inside the hotel aren't much better. If you stay here, prepare yourself for some shaking and loud noises.\n3) Hallways: As soon as we walked out of the elevator, it felt as if we walked straight into a frat house. The carpets are gross and the hall smell like weed.\n4) Room: As my friend and I made our way to the room (after exchanging multiple looks of \"is this really happening to us?\"), we entered our tommy bahama themed room only to discover that there's another door inside our room that connects to our neighbors room. Yeah, this is common in some hotels, but there was a three-inch gap at the bottom of the door. REALLY!?! I didn't even sleep under the covers. Instead, I put towels down and slept on top of them.

If we hadn't booked our room through expedia and could get our money back, I would have checked out the minute we checked-in. I would have gladly paid $200+ to stay anywhere else.

There were stains in so many random places throughout the rooms and hair in the bathroom. Our rooms did not look vacuumed and the bathroom was not wiped down.  We were so disgusted. We also requested a refrigerator but they charge $25 a day for a refrigerator in your room. We also called for more towels one morning because we used one of the towels to wipe down our bathroom head to toe and they never came. I guess they figured they would just do it anyway later during the day. Whatever the reason, we had to use our personal beach towels so that sucked. I will post photos later. My girlfriends complained to the front desk when we left and they got their resort fee comped so that was nice. The pool looked nice but we rented a cabana next door at the Tropicana which was much better and where I wanted to stay at to begin with but the Tropicana rates went up and down so we should've booked asap. Lesson learned. Another thing that we were not happy about at Hooters was that they were working on the parking garage so our vehicle had to be out by 11 am. One of the nights when we came back  to the hotel the parking lot was packed full. Our driver decided to park our vehicle down the street instead. Honestly, I felt pretty bad for the valet workers. One of them mentioned where the Hooters employees had to park and I felt sorry for them. I thought that by staying at that hotel we would at least get coupons to use for their restaurant in the hotel but we got none of that. Overall it was a very disappointing stay and we will not be staying there again. We are paying the money for a better hotel next time no matter what kind of deals Hooters offers with everyone's flight packages. Don't stay here. You have been warned."

Unfortunately we booked through PL so we had no recourse in the absolutely horrible experience we had here!\nFor starters, we check in at about 2 AM, yet still get charged for a resort fee which staff said was for the use of the pool (which was closed), parking (the garage was closed, we had to park in the Tropicana's lot), wifi (slower than cell tower, if you can connect) and 'other amenities'. I just drove 7+ hrs and wasn't in the mood to argue so I signed off on it, knowing there wouldn't be a hotel mgr there anyway. \nWe get up to the room and upon opening the door, the room already had a funny smell. I've stayed in a lot of hotels, some nice, some not and this was BY FAR the worst. M6's in the middle of CA are better than this place. I walk into the bathroom and immediately I noticed the toilet was dirty as well as the vanity top/sink. The shower appeared clean but who knows... Once into the room we noticed it had once been flooded by a previous plumbing issue, obviously not properly repaired if the carpet was stained and peeling away from the wall. At least they repainted the drywall. There were enough stains on the carpet that the wife and I both didn't feel comfortable not wearing shoes in the room, ALL the time. The fan, or lack thereof in the bathroom was 'inconvenient' to say the least when one needs to 'take care of business'. The shower pressure was just 'ok'. But what was REALLY annoying was the fact that the temperature would swing, from cold to hot, while using it. Talk about annoying!! As soon as you'd get a good temp adjustment it would get cold, then you tough it out for a few seconds and it would get hot, then back to cold. Just an uncomfortable cycle. Try to adjust it at the wrong time and you're jumping out of the water before it scalds you.\nWe turned on the A/C since the room was stuffy and it emitted quite a noise, so we had to run it for a while before bed because there was no way one could sleep with it on. The sliding door to the outside, facing the pool area would not seal properly and let in excessive noise. This place is close to the airport so the noise was well above what would be considered 'average'. We were on the fifth floor, so maybe that's why they didn't care that the door couldn't be secured...I don't know...but the door couldn't be locked likely due to the fact that it wouldn't even close properly to seal out noise and weather. At this point I'm surprised the TV works! The clock radio was old and turned out to be a disappointment. It had an 'aux' jack on it so you could use your i-pod or phone for music, I thought 'that's cool'! It had such a humming noise it was unusable. The lamps looked like they all came from different hotels in Vegas that had closed, not one of them matched and they were all falling apart (leaning, nearly inoperable switches, etc). If I haven't painted the picture for you, I'm not sure how else I could.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Don't stay here. And I strongly suggest not booking the area in which this hotel is located on Priceline as you will be stuck, just as we were!"

This time we decided to keep it cheap, so we decided on the Hooters Hotel and Casino. Here are just a few things:\n\nThe garage elevator was the scariest experience of my life. I hate elevators to begin with, they make me claustrophobic right off the bat, but this one, the doors didn't even open up all the way to let us out and I felt like we were almost in between floors when this happened. I didn't use this when we needed to return to the parking garage on the day we left either, I opted to use the stairs instead, all 5 stories of them. Whatever, I could use the exercise. \n\nI know that casinos smell like booze and cigs for the most park, but just walking through the casino nauseated me. The stench of cigs were just so potent. I felt like I was consumed, seriously, and we visited plenty of other hotel and casinos and did just fine with the smoke. My hair smelled for days after that even after plenty of shampoo applications.\n\nIt's sort of disturbing when you see a pregnant Hooters girl at their Hooters restaurant inside of this hotel waiting on tables with all that smoke going around. In fact, we took this trip a while ago and we are still talking about that. \n\nThis is located a little bit off the strip, so its sort of a walk to all the main attractions, if you don't mind all of the cons mentioned above, then just the amount of money you save on a room is sort of worth it to stay there. \n\nThe rooms were extremely cheesy. Adorned in Hooters paraphernalia, as it was expected though. The coat hanger in the bathroom was ripped off and not replaced, the beds were so so and the view from our room was....errrr....fantastic (insert sarcastic remark here). \n\nI do have to say though, the Hooters casino waitresses don't disappoint. The one time I sat at the slot machines with my sister, they were very prompt to serve us our free drink. Chintzy on the alcohol though, as I guess that's expected given this isn't exactly a 5 star hotel, and I'm not a huge drinker to begin with. Needless to say, we have passed on staying here since this trip. If you're looking for a really cheap hotel that's close enough to the strip and you don't mind pregnant waitresses waiting on you in heavy cig smoke, then Hooters is your place!"

But I will express my feelings on towards a \"mediocre\" time - which is simply an A-OK for fun, food, and functionality.\n\nQuick Note: This place will work for you and your pals if you are on a budget. Believe me, in Vegas takes your breath away as well as your cash, so for the location (which is on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Tropicana) its close to the MGM to grab the tram, New York New York to ride the coaster, and is at the beginning of the strip to begin your Bar or Club crawls. It is worth the price and accommodation of making it an affordable stay in Sin City.\n\nMy previous review is still very much valid. I will say the Pool and the Restaurants have changed. Restaurant is still OK food. The pool hours aren't 24 hours, but if you are a guest in the hotel you do have the after hour privileges. Oh and I do enjoy the Taxi Cab waiting area.. takes around 3 mins to get a cab here! Bravo! Thank you.  A+ for the cabbing efforts!! \n\nOverALL: Its a Hoot!! Take a gamble. Its a hit or miss. But location makes up for it big time!"

I just came here to grab a quick bite to eat on 1/7/12 and I thought there was some improvement. I actually came to eat at Mad Onion, but its been turned into a steakhouse. So Hooters it was. I ordered the \"Lots Of Tots\" appetizer and the boneless chicken wings. The portions were large enough for me and my husband to share. With that plus a house Margarita my bill was only $22...so that was a plus. This girls are hotter than they were when we came the last time, but they were flat out ugly before so thats not saying much. Once again more guys were staring at me than the waitresses. And they notice which causes some major rudeness directed at me. So thats why they don't get 5 stars. If you're doing your job just to get attention, go be a stripper."

For an Aug booking I could not believe the prices I was given for the hotels. I'm always trying to be on the best budget when I travel and I was down for a hotel on the strip. Hooters is only slightly off the strip. You can pretty easily walk across the road to MGM and cut through to the strip that way. We had a very large room. Of course, for what we paid, I knew this was not going to be like the MGM which I did have the pleasure of staying at before.\nTV was a boob tube. No problem.\nCheesy shower curtains...meh. Not an issue.\nWow...great Keurig coffee maker. Nice surprise....but....not sure if it was me but the darn thing wouldn't work.\nFree wifi all over the hotel...yay!\nNo refrigerator. That's ok.

It wasn't my fault though because I booked through Hotwire. If I could go back and stay in a motel, I would choose that instead. I booked through Hotwire's \"secret deals\" so I was told my hotel was going to be a 3-Star hotel. T-h-r-e-e stars?? N-O. \n\nUpon entering, the hotel smelled old and had very outdated decor. The receptionist was not welcoming (I won't mention names, but you know who your angry self is). We frantically rushed to our room on the fifth floor (because I had to get ready to leave right away). Guess what? Our AC wasn't working and we let it run at least for 30 minutes. Had a maintenance guy come in to try to fix it. 110 degree weather and I had to sit in my own sweat along with this musty ass hotel. This guy was probably the nicest experience of the hotel (and why I added a star): he was friendly and assured us it'll get fixed. Okay, so I literally lost 40 minutes waiting for things to get fixed. But low and behold, our AC wasn't going to be fixed for another hour--so we opted for another room. The maintenance guy told us to not judge the new owners and that the whole hotel will get renovated soon...\n\nThe room had a funky smell. The toilet made noises when flushed and even the sink. I felt like the toilet water was going to be regurgitated out of the sink. The carpet had many stains and the tv was a blast from the past. I don't care what people say about getting what you pay for. You're still paying for a decent hotel and should at least feel that I can walk around the hotel with no shoes on and not bring home bed bugs. Please hire nicer receptionists. No hot girls walking around and shitty hotel in general. Ugh."

It's at the far South end of the strip, so the cab ride to McCarran is quick. It isn't fancy and there are cheap rooms to be had, so we tried it. \n\nThe guy at the registration desk couldn't have been nicer. We asked for a nonsmoking king on a high floor, and he delivered. We had an amazing view of the Tropicana, Excalibur, and the roller coaster at New York New York.

The room was awful it had a smell to it when we first arrived. If you opened up the window then all you head was the air conditioning sounds for the casino itself so you couldn't really hear anything else especially if you were trying to watch tv. The air conditioning unit in the room just added to the noise. There was a weird stain on the carpet in one of the corners of the room with what looked like white powder on it but never cleaned up. The bathroom was awful the shower curtain was way too short to cover the whole area so one end or the other was open spraying water all over the bathroom. The shower head barely worked and it took longer than normal to take a shower. Don't leave your change out because it will disappear when housekeeping cleans up your room. Downstairs the bars were nice with good wait staff and good bar staff but if you went into the restaurant the service went way down even if they weren't busy. The wings were hit or miss and they even gave us the wrong order once and wouldn't take it back or give us another. $3 blackjack was the best thing about this hotel/casino."

However, today my server Hylee (I hope I am spelling it correctly) was outstanding. Attentive, warm, friendly, genuine personable and sincere. She is 21 and is an absolute rising star in this industry. Great food and absolutely amazing service. Thank you and trust me when I say this, put this young lady behind the bar. She has all the attributes of an amazing bartender. I will be back and I will only come back if she is my server (or bartender). Thank you Hooters. Great hire!!!!!!!!"

            "review": "On my most recent Vegas trip, I went for a bachelor's party, and Hooters is where they guys wanted to stay. Though I prefer to lodge elsewhere, I didn't want to separate myself from the group, so I took a deep breath, and dived into the place that I was so happy to check OUT of a couple of days later. \n\nMy feeling of dejection began the moment we pulled into the garage. Everything is tightly packed in the garage, so each time we turned a corner to ascend to the next level, I had to close my eyes out of fear of that we'd scrape the car against a pillar, or another vehicle. In the garage, there's an elevator, which takes you to the casino level of the main building. The elevator is as dirty and raggedy as something you'd see in a rundown portion of an old NYC subway station. Unlike many other hotel/casinos, which have adequate ventilation systems, to counter the smoke, this casino floor smelled like a tobacco factory. I will give credit to the check-in staff, however, they were very friendly, and a pleasure to interact with! The rooms were ok, nothing special, but it was clean, no bad smells, and I did have a decent view of the strip (8th floor). It's an older no-frills place, so I wasn't expecting marble floors and stone counter tops, so I was ok with what was there. The only issue that I had inside of the room was the shower. The shower heads have only one pressure setting, and it feels like needles pricking your skin. Otherwise, the accommodations where aligned with the pricing of the facility. \n\nI'd say there's a very low likelihood that I'll ever lodge at Hooters again. For me, it's definitely more worthwhile to spend the extra money and stay someplace directly on the strip, with a higher star rating. For the drunken Las Vegas visitor, who just needs a place to sleep, then this is the place for you. Again, despite my dislike for the place overall, I give kudos to the check-in staff for maintaining customer service competence, regardless of the surroundings."

Maybe I feel sorry for it for all of the low star ratings it receives, but I think I can find enough good points to warrant them.\n\nRight, so how much time do you spend in your room when you're in Vegas? If you're like us, next to none. As long as a there's a clean bed, hot shower and enough room to spread your clothes all over the floor as you struggle to find that one t-shirt left in your suitcase that doesn't require ironing you should be fine. Hooters has all of that. Sure, it looks dated and you probably won't have much of a view (that car park we overlooked sure was pretty!) but we paid $25 a night for our stay so you won't hear a word of complaint about the room from me. You can barely get a decent lunch for two people for that price!\n\nHooters is off the strip, but only barely. It's a five minute walk or so, and it's also directly opposite the monorail station at MGM so it's pretty easy to get around from here. It's usually pretty quiet inside, meaning it's pretty easy to get a drink if you're gambling. There was never a line for a taxi and always a taxi outside waiting, while across the road at MGM there seemed to be dozens of people waiting for one. There are plenty of bars inside and places to grab a quick bite and it's small enough to not be ready for a nap after walking from one side of the casino to the other like everywhere else.\n\nFor $25 a night, I'll definitely stay at Hooters again."

TWICE I had to go find her to bring us refills on our drinks- and then at the end of the night she charged us for things we didn't have and brought us some imprint of my credit card to sign...she brought me a BLANK imprint of my credit card to sign- no total, no nothing, just a blank license to take as much money as she wanted from me. I don't think so darling.\n\nSo in the end, she got a s****y tip, a dirty look and her self fulfilling prophecy was ultimately fulfilled. Congratulations lady! You ruined everyone's night! Good Job!"

For a casino/hotel so close to the strip, the price was right.\n\nI stayed in one of the pool-facing \"bungalo\" rooms, which I'm sure in the summer are a great place to be. Not so much in February, when all you have to look forward to is a long walk to the casino (or in my case, the front door and the rest of Vegas). The peeling shower/tub didn't drain and the in-room safe proved nonexistent, which bothered me. For some reason, this felt like the sort of place I might actually want or need the safe.\n\nThe casino IS on the smaller side, but I'm not quite sure what earlier reviewers hope for. More slots? Because whenever I walked into the newer, larger casinos, that's what I saw. Row upon row upon row of slots. It's a smaller, slightly off Strip hotel, so for the traffic, the casino is plenty spacious and there's sufficient variety of gaming as well. I did, however, feel like the $10 craps table - usually the only table operating - was a bit high relative to other casinos of it's caliber, but whatever.\n\nThe restaurants aren't great, but if you're looking for an inexpensive Vegas room and don't want to break the bank, plop your butt at the nickle slots and suck down a few comped drinks. And if nothing else, Hooters provides a nice launching off point for the rest of the Strip."

First of all, the rooms are extremely old and outdated. They need to be cleaned and renovated. The carpet is old, the beds are clean but look so old and worn out. Also the place looks like it was about to fall apart. The toilet took a while to flush, the iron was busted and broken, the ceiling walls were peeling, the shower did not have a shower mat, the room did not even have a chair for the desk or a small couch inside even though there was room for one. The hallways look outdated. I did not feel like I was staying in a hotel or casino, it was a cheap dirty motel. \n\nThe only way I would stay here again is if I see that $20 deal again on Groupon and I'm only staying for one night.

Moving on...\n\nThe man and I had an impromptu \"let's get the hell out of Dodge\" moment and we seized it.  We stayed here Tues, December 29 - Thursday, December 31.  We picked this place because it was cheap and close to the Strip (even though Downtown is better).    Based on the reviews, we were willing to risk some things.  So here is the summary:\n\n* Yes, we did witness the parking garage elevator not working.  But it was only once out of 4 times using it and we were not hauling our bags in or out, so we were fine with walking 4 flights of stairs to the car.  To the poor ladies hauling out kids, bags and strollers....sorry.\n\n*The bed was stiff as a board.  I can handle firm, but there was no bounce to this bed at all. \n\n*The plumbing system is old, but works.  Slow drain sink, slow flush toilet.  \n\n*Our room was not dirty, just dated.\n\n* We got hot water all the time, just fine.  I even took a shower around 11:00 a.m. and there was still plenty of water.\n\n*Our room was missing the \"DO NOT DISTURB\" sign, which we only learned about when we heard the maids coming around and we needed to act on it.  I went to get one from the maids, but they did not have one.  I ran into one downstairs and she did not have one.  Another employee told me I had to get one from reception, so fine.  I asked for one and was told she would call someone to bring it up.  Totally inefficient and it does not make me happy when I have a hangover.\n\nAs for the casino...\n\n*The free $100 slot play promotion is definitely one of those \"too good to be true\" things.  After you sign up for the lame Player's Club (I lost my card somewhere in the casino), you get a voucher and you walk into a roped off area.  An employee will insert a $100 bill into one machine that you choose.  They are $5 slot machines and you have to play the max (so $10 a pull).  If you are lucky enough to get to 1700 credits, you get $50.  Other than that, you are screwed.  Total lameness.\n\n*Takes the cocktail waitresses FOREVER to bring you a drink.  I hate getting sober when I am waiting to get hammered.  \n\n*Beware of the slow dealers that come on shift at 2:00 a.m. -- they may put you to sleep.\n\nOverall, take heed of the reviews and make the decision yourself.  Will we stay here again?  Probably not.  But we do not think we made a bad decision since we went into it informed."

For the most part things were quiet and had no problems relaxing in the room.\n\nA couple negatives were that these bright lights shined on the hotel right outside our window at night.  The lights were the ones that shine on the hotel itself.   We actually had a pretty impressive view of the strip but was somewhat ruined by the blinding lights that flooded our room.  Luckily, great window shades were provided.  The other negative was the TV was rather outdated.  Having a flat screen put in would have been nice.\n\nFor the location and price range, the Hooters Casino Hotel is definitely a good idea if you're coming to Vegas on a limited budget."

I don't know the exact definition of 3 stars, but what we got was essentially a rundown Motel 6 with very poor service.\n\nThe hallways smelled bad, and the carpet throughout was dingy and stained.  Decor is cheap and the building looks very old.  At the restaurant, we got fooled by a breakfast buffet on the menu that magically becomes a \"champagne brunch\" on weekends for $3 more.  Management was minimally concerned when we took issue with the surprise on our bill.  Most of the offerings were stale and hard to bite into.  The bar by the pool carded my wife for a diet coke, which she was forced to return to the pool chair for.\n\nI understand the concept of getting what you pay for, but I wouldn't have paid even $50 a night for this experience.  I will never return - it made the trip a disappointment."

There biggest pool that is the best for kids feels like it is filled with ice cubes my daughter started screaming and crying because it was so cold. You are not allowed to take the pool towels into the building so you have to walk in dripping wet and cold with the air conditioner is blasting. The drains in the bathroom do not go down so when you take a shower it turns into a bath. Which is kind of disgusting because you end up standing in all the dirt and soap you just washed off. Parking is free which is a plus. The rooms are definitely not sound proof you hear the music blasting even 8 floors up from the pool area. When I got here there was no toilet paper in the bathroom.  Was I supposed to provide my own? And they have a Keurig in the room but no coffee to put in it. Kind of pointless. One of my lamps did not work. Also housekeeping takes forever to get to your room, it's past noon and still not a single house keeper has made it to the room. The phone says they have room service but there is nothing to tell you what they serve or how much each thing costs."

Within walking distance to the blvd. It is ,by comparison, worth the price. The view on the 18th floor was good. We checked in hours early and they were very flexible. Staff were friendly and respectful. Rooms were decent. The complimentary breakfast for 2 and the free $10 voucher for gaming is a plus. There were no issues, loud noises or other complaints. There is a small safe, iron & board, modern coffee machine and plenty of closet & drawer space. Modesty with woman is higher here then many others in Vegas.\n\nNegatives: the room decor isn't bad but it is partially outdated. Windows were spotted with dirt. The tv was still the tube type. The A/C unit in the room was loud (like rolling thunder) and many others didn't work or looked old and neglected through out the public areas. Elevators were dirty.

Unless your a business man w a tie on they treat you like shit! Rude waitresses, cashiers, and staff at the pool! #3 So both of my room keys stopped working and I'm not the one that paid for the room so they won't reprogram my key! We have the same last name and I am the second adult on the paperwork staying in the room. Tried to get it reprogrammed at 4pm and they wouldn't even call the room to make sure it's okay to give me a key. Then at 2am when my 3 year old is asleep and the second key doesn't work they still won't reprogram the key but the manager can call now! Wtf is wrong with these people?!!! The people at the front desk are MORONS! There all young dumb assholes, including the managers! #4 dirty #5 the casino is small. The games suck. At all times there are gross men trolling the casino for women. The waitresses never come back even when you tip! #6 I love wings. They do have good wings....but the service is terrible! Unless your party is all men and you have money the waitresses avoid you at all costs. It's hard to just get a dam soda refill. Hostesses seem to be the worst of all. #8 the pool is freezing! It's 99 at sunset and we swam for 5 mins. I was wondering why nobody was in the pool. #9   A/C suddenly stopped working.  Had to have the repair guy come fix it while my kid was napping. \nI will never stay here again! I will never come back to the casino or the restaurant ever again!!!!!

Found online a room at hooters cost 25.00 per night which was an incredible price. Since we are locals we decided to walk-in and view our options since we live in the city. The lady at registration gave us a room for 20.00 more because it was a walk in. Still not bad so we took the offer and gave us a room on the third floor. As we walk up to the third floor the hallway smells like dead fish. It's a very uncomfortable smell and I immediately started not to like the place. We walk in the room and it smells even worse, it felt like no one had been there for awhile and left an open fridge full of meat inside. So I walk to open up a window and sure enough there was moths everywhere and jumped up on me ! (There was at least three huge moths) I freaked out and locked myself in the bathroom. My bf tried killing them and insisted it was ok but we both agreed to walk back down and get another room. So we did, gave us the room and although it still smelled the room overall was fairly cleaned, everything is VERY outdated. Little holes on walls and dirty carpets. If I was a tourist from out of town to stay here I'd be very upset. This place needs changes."

I had never been to this location and I won't be back.\n\nFirst off, the hostess kept us waiting for about 10 minutes while they \"cleaned off a table\" (mind you, there were only 4 of us).  As we were being seated, there were plenty of empty tables so I'm not sure what that was all about.  We interacted with three different hostess/waitresses and all were very rude.  The food was terrible.  One guest in our party had the steamed shrimp for $11.49. There were maybe 12 smallish shrimp on her plate (no side dishes for this price by the way) and shelling the shrimp seemed to be a lot more trouble than it was worth.  One guest had the fish and chips - he said it had no real taste at all.  I tried the chili (which I have loved at other locations) and here it was very bland and the texture was more like a can of cat food.\n\nAll this was after a 32 minute wait for our food.  I know that because by the time we finally got seated I started worrying about the flight our guests had to catch so I was watching the clock.  Not once during this time did a waitress come to refill drinks or let us know our food was on its way.  In fact, we didn't see her at all until she brought the food out.\n\nI tried voicing my concerns about the food and the wait but the waitress looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language and dropped off our check and walked away.  I usually give people and restaurants the benefit of the doubt but I really think unless you happen to be staying at this hotel and don't want to bother going somewhere else, steer clear."

You pay for what you get. \n\nPros: check in was quick, pool was nice, one bartender was awesome when he looked at me and said,\"looks like you need a Bloody Mary and a breakfast burrito\"(hungover), it was delicious. Low pice on rooms with a hotel walking distance to the strip. Decent bed with clean sheets. Casino is small but has everything you need. \n\nCons: it's run down, old. Needs some renovation, updating, demolition. Wings? No good (to my taste) you'd be better with cooking frozen wings in a microwave. Food is mediocre (other than the breakfast burrito). If you're in a room over looking the pool, hope you enjoy noise. Tube TV and a game cube for \"entertainment\". Bathrooms are what you'd get at a cheap hotel. Sinks drained SLLOOWWWW...waiting for a taxi? It's quicker to walk to the MGM Grand and wait there. \n\nAll in all, it's what you pay for.

The 10 for 10 wings needed to be approved by a manager which took a while to find one or for them to even come ask us what we wanted.

I walked down here all the way from the Wynn, which was a journey in itself, just for the cheap beer and wings (which we all love).\n\nSo I get there, empty bar, but no service to be found. I wait five minutes, and finally the bartender acknowledges me and I get an overpriced bud light. But that's the least of my worries...\n\nThe real reason I came there was to get some wings. So I went to the restaurant, and there were two hostesses who seemed more than annoyed with my presence (like who is going to seat him / where are we going to seat him, when the restaurant was more than half empty). \n\nBut again, that wasn't my problem... After 15 mins of sitting there, and knowing the whole time what I wanted to order (recall that I had that whole time walking there to contemplate life) I finally went to the bartender, told him I'd been there forever, and said I'd like to order. The bartender looked at me like I was an idiot, and accused me of seating myself. So that tassel went on for a while, and we finally resolved that issue after he went to the kitchen to yell at the only people who were actually doing their job. (Side note, the bartender was actually really nice / doing his job too, and an innocent victim in all this).\n\nThe real problem was the waitress who showed up twenty minutes after the fact. She instigated that I was going to order and run without paying. Wtf, what is it against brown people and this restaurant? Well after this argument, and me presumably winning, she finally took my complicated order of ten regular wings. Another fifteen minutes went by...and at this point I thought I'd make a simple request for water (I guess they had expected me to eat dinner dry).\n\nEnd of story, I had my wings an hour later (which were great, don't get me wrong). But, what the heck was up with the service? Between the two hostesses seeming annoyed to seat me (why the f it takes two to seat one person to begin with, I don't  know), and then an hour to order one plate of regular wings (and having to put in the leg work myself), I regret my hour long Harold/Kumar-esque journey \n\nAnd I wouldn't remember the waitresses name, except when she all of a sudden became attentive after handing me the check. At that point, she made sure to show up three times in the span of minutes. Thanks Franki\n\nOh!!!! And I forgot!! So the staff actually felt bad and apologized, and gave me an order of fries with my wings. But Franki then came moments later, and said \"you didn't order this,\" and took the wings. Thanks"

The gym is small, but they provide necessary equipment for you to stay fit--treadmill, stationary bicycle, elliptical, free weights, a core ball, and other weight equipment I am unfamiliar with.

Lots of light colored wood.   The only real problem I had was that the elevator was pretty dam slow.\n\nMy only advice is to NOT stay in the \"Bungalos\" out by the pool.. We started there - but managed to move into the main hotel.\n\nLook if you want a cheap room around th strip this place is a good value."

I say get a hotel thats just a few dollars more and not cheap out like I did. I also ate there too...big mistake! The wings were drenched in vinagar tasting sauce and the fries I had were cold. The waitress had horrible customer service. I can't say that for all of the waitresses there because I saw another waitress that was attentive to her customers we just had a bad one. I'd rather stay at the Excalibur the next time I go, it was about 10 bucks more a night....damn what a mistake!"

You can tell that the casino and room are older I feel they do make an effort to keep it clean and maintained but have given up on renovation. First time I flushed the toilet it seemed clogged so I emptied a trashcan filled it with water and got it to work that way but after that no issues with it.

The way Hooters advertises it (giant banners down the side of the hotel proclaiming \"$3 Blackjack 24/7!\"), you'd think they would at least have several tables at this price. Nope. They had two $3 tables (both full of course), and all the rest were $10 and above.\n\nIn sticking with the company slogan of being \"delightfully tacky\", the casino area itself looked pretty low class.

Dan Marino's restaurant (see review) was good.  Staff was friendly.  Overall a good experience, especially considering the price."

            "review": "I have to say, for being my first time in Vegas, the Hooters Hotel and Casino was a really good place to stay - it didn't have the wild experience, and it was at the end of the strip.  Next time I probably would want to be more in towards the middle of the strip when I stay in Vegas, but this place did me just fine.  \n\nThe room we were staying in at Hooters was pretty screwed up though.  We had issues with the bathroom from when we first got there.  I had just driven 5 hours in from Phoenix (after a quick stop at the Damn) - and wanted to shower.  We took showers, and noticed that the water wasn't draining in the tub.  So I told the front desk that this was happening.  They said they would be sending someone up - so we left, went and walked around - had dinner, etc and did the nightly Vegas thing.\n\nWe came back, went to bed, woke up and went to take showers only to notice that the shower was still doing the same thing.  I went back downstairs, told them the story, and off we went again, as they said someone would be back up to fix it.  We came back after breakfast and I checked the shower - it worked!  I flushed the toilet, and it didnt flush.. WTF Mate?\n\nAnyway - I go back downstairs, now a little bit pissed (It takes a lot to get me mad, and If I'm frustrated, I get what I want).  So I went downstairs, talked to the person at the desk - didnt like the response of, \"We'll send someone back up..\"  So I talked to a manager and told him we either wanted a new room, or we were going to another hotel - and we were upgraded to a better room.\n\nNow normally this would look bad, but I like a place that actually listens to customers.  I never asked for an upgrade or a better room the first two times I went down there.. I really didn't want to move my bags.  So the third time, I just didnt want to deal with it anymore.  So we ended up getting an upgrade, and something like 20% off the entire bill, which I was completely satisfied with.\n\nThe rooms are actually really nice too.  They make you feel like you are in a Hooters (shocking, I know) and the hotel staff is generally very friendly and accommodating.  The pool outside looked great, although it was a bit below swimming temperature for me at the time, but again - it looked great with the outdoor bars and everything.\n\nThe casino is nice too.  A little bit cramped in some spots, but a nice feel to the place.  And again, its nice to be in a casino and see hooters girls a plenty!\n\nWhether you are staying at their hotel or not, you have to at least check it out.  It is worth it!"

            "review": "Okay, we went here for one reason (in January 2010), and that reason was that it was cheap at the time for a Saturday night, vs the Palms where we were staying the night before.   So there wasn't a big expectation and Hooters happily enough obliged in not making one.  \n\n As a previous reviewer noted, the parking garage really is a good indicator of what this hotel is about.   It was smallish and cramped when driving up to find a spot there were great puddles of water on the floor, never mind that the floor we stopped at was about the 4th.  We parked away from the elevator to ensure we had plenty of space and got in the little death trap of an elevator that takes you to the casino.  I say death trap because it rattles, groans, creaks and really does a great job at making you feel like it's going to drop any moment.   Then when we got off the elevator and avoided being smashed by people looking to scurry away from here, we found that it was a modest sized hotel, with bored waitresses, dealers, and a rather rude security guard. Hotel staff seemed not to be enjoying their jobs either; the cleaning woman seemed to be the only one enjoying her job.\n\nWe went to the other set of elevators to the tower rooms and the somewhat dingy hall to find our room.   Window by the elevator had a cool view of the airport.     Rooms looked exactly like the ones on the Hooters website, if you look closely enough.   Nightstands are really just table tops and otherwise, it's the garish no frills room it's made out to be.   We had a 17th floor strip view room, which had pretty killer views of the Tropicana, Luxor, and Exalibur, and a side view of sorts of the neon green glow of the MGM, so definitely no complaints about that.\n\nThe casino floor had a decent assortment of slots and the gift shops had the usual Hooters merchandise available.   The club there had Prince and Snoop Dogg music blaring loudly, so lots of p***y control and that type; not what you'd call family friendly but perfectly in line with the kind of tackiness that Hooters is.   \n\nSo not a bad place and compared to other casinos, I think you get what you pay for here."

Yes, hooters, but also cheesy 1980's decor - the clock radios your parents have, the Zenith TVs, and the wood-paneled headboards are part of the kitsch. Were you expecting the Wynn? LOL You're in *Hooters*! The girls are still wearing white sneakers and orange shorts, for crissakes. \n\nSpeaking of which, I didn't actually see very many Hooters girls, maybe two the entire trip aside from the girls running the tables. The casino floor stays busy, even at 5 am, and people are rocking the pool during the day, even in January. A few too many families with little kids for my taste, but what can you do. Maybe Hooters has finally eclipsed Disneyland.\n\nIn a pinch and with a deal, I'd come back in a second.

If it's on then it feels like an ice box, and when it's off it feels like the sun! It was rough sleeping in the room with the ac on, but I guess that's what the free alcohol is for...\n\nDuring my last night staying here, there was supposed to be some work done on the water system so water was supposed to be off between 2am-5am. I woke up at 7am to get ready for my last work meeting and there is no running water, that was very unfortunate. I couldn't shower, make coffee, brush my teeth, or flush the toilet (if you get what I'm saying).\n\nI'm normally not a picky person and would always give the benefit of the doubt to anyplace, but if you can afford a nicer place then GO THERE!!

Unsurprisingly, it's also the most crowded spot in the joint, so good luck pulling up a seat. I sat at the video poker machines and dropped $70 in about 20 min and the goddamn waitress didn't come by once to keep my blood alcohol level high enough to not start getting pissy about my losses. That fact alone will keep me out of here for a long time. \n\nOne marginal positive note is that they have $0.25 wings from 12am-6am, although if you've ever eaten wings from Hooters you know that means you'll probably spend only a couple bucks to get high cholesterol, the caloric equivalent of 5 Whoppers and a long bout of diarrhea.

The hotel also has a really nice pool area with a bar. The Hooters restaurant is good, but predictably overpriced.\n\nService at the hotel is pretty poor.

When I called housekeeping to request more towels (we only had two, and there were four people staying in the room), no one picked up the phone and I had to leave a voicemail message. No one ever got back to me. When housekeeping cleaned the room on Wednesday, they didn't replace the toilet paper or shampoo, and we were clearly running out of both.\n\nAs others have noted, the atmosphere is a lot like that of a frat house.

First off, their hotel was advertised on a magazine, and was suggested as one of the pools to experience. So my group of friends thought to try something different. We get there, not only do they tell you that you have to rent a room to go in the pool (because ceasars and hard rock let the public swim for free without having to rent a room), but when they advertise the 25 cent chicken wing deal they hide the actual terms in fine print as if they were sleazy salesmen. You have to first, sign up for a players card to get the 25 cent deal. Then, you have to buy a 10 wing minimum. Then after the bad service and EXTRA and I do not exaggerate the EXTRA greasy chicken wings you find what you thought was a deal turned to be a hefty check after they ring up $1 PER RANCH SAUCE, $1.50 PER NON REFILLABLE DRINK, $1 per to go box which can only limit ten wings per box. If you have 15 wings you HAVE TO GET TWO. So I mean at the end of the night, you lost your appetite for good wings, and you walk away with horrible experience because the service was bad, the people were rude, and the charges were ridiculous. I mean its not even a top rated hotel. Obviously. \n\nThe only cool thing was that the pool was open late night if you are down for a late night swim and the pool is nice, and rooms are REALLY CHEAP. Sso I'll leave my review for that hotel with two stars."

It's just a really orange place; aptly enough, the club there is called Orange as well although it would probably take roofies to get me in that place.\n\nHowever, it had 3 things that I really liked:  1) The martini bar.  It was great!  The atmosphere isn't the exact thing I always go for, but I felt comfortable there.  Happily enough I discovered a college friend was the manager so I got some free libations.  2)  The pool!  It was February and we made our way out to the pool just because and to our delight found a fire pit set back from the deck with seating around it.  It was delightful!  3)  There was a bar inside with dueling pianos.  Not as impressive as the ones at the NY, NY but less crowded and with less expensive drinks.\n\nThe non-Hooters amenities of this place were impressively impressive."

Trust me, pay the extra $$ to stay somewhere else!! Somewhere that doesn't have stains all over the carpet, a tub that drains or cigarette burns in the duvet cover!  \n\nThe girl who checked us in was not very friendly, but the girl who checked us out was.. so it's hit or miss with the staff. Also, I thought Hooters girls were supposed to be hot?? Guess it's slim pickens in Vegas, all the hot girls are working at the Wynn I suppose.\n\nAlso, pieces of the laminate hardwood floors in the lobby and hallways are all broken up or cracked and I stubbed my toe really hard on a piece where the shitty floor meets the nasty ass casino carpet. OW! goddamn piece of shit Hooters!!\n\nThe elevators are rickety and scary sounding just as other people's reviews say, it's no lie.\n\nThe pool is tiny and the towels they give you are an absolute joke! They look like the towels they use to wipe down the bar with! and they are TINY! I'm an average size chick, I had to use 3 towels just to equal ONE normal size towel, also there are black stains all over them like some was just cleaning a car with them EEWW!!\n\nI'm a vegetarian, so we ate one night at the restaurant \"The Mad Onion\" in the hotel.. grooooossss.\n\nMAYBE the ONLY good thing would be the $1.50 beers at the bar.. but i always bring my own alcohol to Vegas so it didn't matter much to me."

The service was decent, but the food just did not taste as good as normal. We stayed there for a few nights (we are locals, this was cheap and while our house did not have water for laundry repair) and ended up eating there twice. I usually LOVE the buffalo chicken sandwich, and both times it was very dry, and pretty much sauce-less and taste-less. Normally, I love this sandwich and its smothered. My boyfriend got salads both times which were much better. I'd say this is the worst Hooters we have ever been to."

Maybe I am used to staying at like Mandalay where when you walk in, the check in desk is like 2 feet from the poker tables but thats okay. So we waited FOREVER to get helped just to check in, then we get to our floor we were staying on and as we walked down the hall there was a awful smell. As the weekend went on the smell slowly lingered through the whole hallway, i was convinced there was a dead body in the room next to us or something it was that bad. They knew it too because they put a big fan in the hallway like that would resolve the issue? Our keys kept deactivating as for our friends staying too so we constantly had to go back downstairs for the to reactivate it so we could get into our rooms (waiting forever to get helped each time) and our bathroom was gross, our view was of the backstreet and the \"break\" area of the workers so we could watch them smoke, lucky us! When we were getting onto the elevator a cockroach went running across the floor! Some workers were walking by and I said, umm, theres a cockroach!! and they laughed and said, Im not getting it! and kept walking. They were VERY concerned. The pool was nice, small, but nice!

I had a wedding to attend at the MGM Grand and was trying to find a deal. Hooters was right across the street and much cheaper. I got lucky and caught two free nights on my Hotels.com app so this was an easy decision. To start I paid about 150 for 4 nights. After reading online reviews i was skeptical and expected just bargain motel fare. But the room was suprisingly huge and comfortable. So the value was in the space. Sadly they don't have Wifi but wired internet. I was lucky enough to bring my laptop so it worked, but i was relegated to the desk. The casino was small but did have $1, $3 and $5 blackjack tables which is my fav game. The food was usual Hooters fare, fried stuff, and the other restaurant was ok. I went next door to cOco's for cheap breakfast and was always a hop skip and a jump from the MGM grand and the strip. The pool was small but quiet and the only one i knew in the area that was 24/7. Overall Hooters is a bargain and you're never too far from the action. I blew the extra money i saved at the tables of course  :("

I mean, all you had to do is take the concept they had for Hooters restaurants and expand it, right? Yes, and no, but mostly yes. \n\nFirst of all, this hotel isn't upscale at all, nor does it pretend to be. It's pretty no-frills, with the main attraction being that Hooters concept. It works just fine, as the place is just very beach-y without being dumb. I don't know if that makes sense when I write it out, but it makes sense when you come to this place. \n\nAs a local, I appreciate that this resort is near the Strip without it being right there in all the action... that is, I like that I can go in right after leaving UNLV and then heading back out on Trop without hitting too much Strip craziness. \n\nNow, on to my review of the Hooters restaurant: I love the restaurant. I love the wings. I love that the girls are flirtatious. I love that the beers are always ice cold. I love that there are no crazy vegan options to clutter the menu. The restaurant is clearly geared toward dudes, which makes it even more appealing to me. The wings here, though, are the main show. They have different levels of hotness for you to sample from, and none of them disappoint. Even the hottest ones are still super delicious. Plus, the waitresses are really on. They know what they're doing, and they have a great level of service here, probably better than any of the other Hooters' I've been to."

Making us realize that all the kitchen did was reheat in the fryer.  Still wasn't very appetizing.   I'll stick with beer and wings, seems as though those things can't be messed up.  \n\nSitting at the bar, waitresses coming up to the order computer and complaining about their customers or 'bad' tip to the bartender/coworkers is a bit offending and immature.  Be thankful to have a job and quit talking smug around other customers about customers.  \n\nThe bartenders have been great each visit though.  Victoria is great, friendly, and speedy.   I'd love to come here everytime she's working...worth my time and tip!"

            "review": "I have been going to Las Vegas since Hooters was known as the San Remo, even though I may not been gambling at the time. When the hotel changed over to Hooters, it was actually a really fun place. It really felt like you were at Hooters restaurant just with gambling. Loved the casual atmosphere, fun girls and frankly, this kind of feeling felt perfect for Vegas. \n\nNow the resort was never anything special. The rooms were, and still are very small but when you were only spending three hours a day in them and you were either sleeping or showering, you did not really care. \n\nBut now, it seems that this hotel has taken a hard turn for the worst. The fun atmosphere seems to have been replaced by people who are always angry, from guests, to pit bosses to dealers. The vibe in there is bad and you mix that in with a below-average hotel, you can see why no one stays there anymore. \n\nI also use to win there a lot, at odd hours, but if I played between 2AM-6AM, I can almost guarantee winning, not anymore. Not that I blame the casino for, it's the risk I take but overnight my luck seemed to have changed. Given that the hotel has had to lower its rates, you get a lot of amateur blackjack players in there now that will not play the book and frankly will screw you if you play at the same table. \n\nYou could get an awesome craps game there if you have a cool dealer or two. \n\nOne of my major complaints about the resort is the constant changing of the restaurants. It use to be Dan Marino's and now it is like The Angry Onion, but basically the same menu. One time a friend and I went to Dan Marino's, they got his order wrong about 4 times. I had finished my dessert before he began to eat his steak. It seems like the resort is trying to make amends to me for it and invites me back with coupons or free dinners, which is fine but they still manage to screw up the meal most of the time.  Hooters the restaurant is also there and one thing about it is that the wings seem better there than at most locations and this is coming from someone who does not like the wings. \n\nOne benefit to Hooters is the pool is open 24 hours, which on a hot, drunk night in the summer could be a lot of fun, when the pool gets crowded, it gets crowded. The pool itself though is very beautiful, with a waterfall and fire pits. You could even stay at a bungalow near the pool, which I recommend, instead of a standard room. \n\nThe parking at Hooters is still an issue, with valet taking a while to get your car back and self parking being in a parking lot that is way too small with way to small parking spaces. \n\nHooters used to be a fun whole in the wall off-strip casino, but now it seems it is definitely going down hill."

I guess it doesn't take much to hire horrible quality employees. It seemes thieves is all they seek. When I tried to report this to the manager (Donavon) she was completely uninterested, rude and wouldn't help me. When I tried to speak to her further she hung on me. Wow, I was completely stunned. \n\nThe employees there are rude and don't know anything about customer service. The quality of the hotel, food and service was extremely poor and unmanaged my the higher ups. This is a very terrible establishment. I DON'T  recommend booking  your stay there.

One thing is that I had to wait 30 min for a seat at the table since they only have 1 table with 6 seats, but it was definitely worth it for $3 Blackjack.  \n\nThe $3 Blackjack is 6 decks and if you get a Blackjack, it pays 1.16 instead of the typical 1.5, but I'll take that!  The dealers that I encountered were all super nice.  There was this one dealer who was like Flash Gordon and that's a little difficult to stay on top of at 3 am.  \n\nOne thing I was disappointed in was the drink waitress coming around to all the tables at 3am.  It appeared she only came around once every 30 minutes and she didn't pay attention to what people ordered, so when she came to our table, she would call out what she had and people had to take their attention away from their cards and respond.  It wasn't until this guy got up from the table to get his own water and complained to the pit boss that the drink waitress began to come around every 5 minutes, which was then overkill, but it was better than what it was, so we all dealt with it."

Wth?? because supposedly it was strip view which that was an understatement then they asked for a $50 deposit the keys kept not working making it where i had to keep going down to the front desk then when we checked out on the 11th they deducted $8.67 from my $50 deposit stating that it was for their amenities (pool, phones, etc.) which i never took advantage of so now that i know that they are full of it NEVER AGAIN!"

For under $60 the night including tax and resort fees I would say this is one of the better ones.\n\n\nI would stay at a more expensive resort for a special occasion or leisure trip where I would enjoy more of the amenities, but my needs are fairly spartan for short overnights.\n\nThere were 4 outlets next to the bed, which in an older property is difficult to find. I was concerned about cleanliness after reading other reviews.  Although it is worn, I did not see anything was dirty. The carpeting should be replaced, but the spots I saw were stains but not actual dirt. The sink, tub, toilet, and other surfaces were spotless.  I would prefer the bed and pillows were a bit softer, but for under $60 with taxes and resort fees I won't complain. I was very happy to see a Keurig coffee maker with 2 pods in my room.  The internet was included in the resort fees along with 2 bottles of water. Beware the food and drink prices aren't inexpensive, but the strip is right there, and Grubhub and Postmates deliver.  If you don't want to take a cab, get the Uber app. There weren't the sketchy characters I have encountered at other budget hotels either, or tons of smoke. It was quiet on the room floors.\n\nI had pleasant and helpful interactions with all of the employees I encountered.  One was so delightful I encouraged her to apply with my company.\n\nI would rate the hotel a 4 if we were factoring in bells and whistles.  You would want more luxurious lodging on a special occasion trip, but it was more than adequate for my basic needs.  I would stay here again for the price point over others I have tried without hesitation."

Conveniently, Hooters is located across the street from MGM which is in fact on The Strip - so there you go! If it had not been so damned cold we would have walked everywhere - but considering most mornings/nights dropped to around 30F we ended up driving more than expected. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the hotel room and casino quality (considering the price point) and would gladly return here again for a cheap room in the off-season. I've read in other reviews that their rooms are usually $30 a night and that is a great deal.  \n\nOur room was on the 7th floor and had 2 double beds, a great view of their pool, free wi-fi and some cable TV channels (for the record - watching Law & Order SVU when drunk in Las Vegas is extra disturbing). Room service is available if so inclined. \n\nThe CONS in terms of the hotel room: Bathtub had an issue with draining properly and you'd end up standing in the soapy water after a few mins. The beds were a bit springy. No mini-fridge.\n\nThe casino was a step above anything you'd see on Freemont - not fancy but not run down either. The bar served $4 draft beer which was quite nice. They also have those famous hot wings and a cheap prime rib dinner. I didnt eat here but my partners in crime enjoyed a breakfast of steak & eggs and a brk burrito with good reviews. \n\nOverall, three star quality hotel but five star value."

If we hadn't already unpacked everything and took a red eye or we would have moved rooms in a heart beat.  Not to mention room service lost my order and then brought the wrong thing after I re ordered! Room was facing airport so it was very loud, we found if you turn on the ac and the tv you can drowned out most of the noise.

All they did was give us a number to contact some guy, but we have to call on Monday to get everything situated .\n\nThe room was pretty bad, but like I said, we weren't going to complain since we were there for 1 night and leaving in the morning, After this ordeal, I have to complain!!\n\nThe bathtub was slightly stained, the broken window with no screen, the tv was those old big box ones with a fuzzy picture, there was even a carpet stain next to the tv entertainment center, the sliding door for the closet wasn't event attached properly. \n\nUnbelievable!! How is it that no one noticed the broken window previously??? The customer service was HORRIBLE !!!!!!!! I understand that we were upset, but the fact that they did not try and help out is unacceptable. \n\nPros:\n- Right off the strip. You can walk there.\n- Cheap\n \nAs for the Cons, read my review as well as others posted. This place is grimey.\n\n-5 stars from me."

The price was phenomenal for being basically on the strip. Even better were the views from the room (on the Strip side).\n\nThe rooms were nothing special, a little worn and dated decor. The bathroom was clean and the bed comfortable enough. If you are going to Vegas to sit in your hotel room and order room service then do not come here. If your in Vegas to see the sights, view the shows, or gamble; then why do you need a 5-star hotel?! No need to spend $200 per night for a room you might spend 6 hours a day in. \n\nThe staff was respectful and courteous throughout the stay. We called for some extra towels one evening, they were at our door within 5 minutes.\n\nThere was a house band at night all weekend in the restaurant (great female lead vocalist) and a bikini contest on Saturday.\n\nI have never thought of Hooters as a \"Family\" restaurant, nor do I feel this is a family oriented hotel. So leave the kiddies at home for this one. This is were I will stay for future visits."

But decided to give the hotel another chance, as our fellow travelers were looking for someplace a bit cheaper then the big hotels.  We upgraded our room to a suite.  Our suite was two hotel rooms that had been turned into one suite.  So it was nice to have two bathrooms.  The problem was, two of the four days we stayed, our bathrooms were not cleaned.  Just fresh towels.  There was a very small balcony (not big enough for a chair) and when I opened the sliding door, it came off it track.  The room was not bad, but was in bad need of an upgrade.  Chipped tiles, rusty drain, things like that that need to be replaced.  The casino itself I like because it's small and easy to find your group.  But the customer service isn't the best.  Long waits at the bar or on the casino floor to get a drink, and about 75% of the wait staff did not seem very happy to be there.  Bottom line, this is a great hotel if you're young, don't have a lot of money, are just looking for a bed to sleep in and want to have fun in Vegas."

Stay away from the casino.\n\nCheap is nice but I've been disappointed. I spent some time and money at the craps table today and I think they might be playing dirty pool. I was about 10 minutes into a roll, shooting for an 8, when I made the point. The dealer paid out myself and several others on a clearly marked 8, however as we are reaching for the money another manager told him to take all of the money back as one side of the table was marked with a 6 and our side the mark was on 8. No further explanation was given. On opening roll I was told the point was 8, dice read 8 on the first roll, I rolled an 8 for the win, but the casino didn't pay out. I kept going and hit the 6 in the end but I have no trust in the casino or management. Stay away."

We couldn't believe how cheap the rooms were - as long as $25 on weeknights and maybe $60 on weekends. SO much less than what you'd find on the strip. I booked 2 rooms without any problems and couldn't get over how cheap 2 rooms for 3 nights was!\n\nWith that being said, we were fully prepared for a cheap hotel experience and weren't expecting anything like Caesars or The Venetian. We were pleasantly surprised at how \"nice\" the place was. If you need a comparison, think of a Days Inn or Comfort Inn. The main lobby has all the gambling and blackjack tables as low as $3. There are several restaurants and apparently the pool rocks, but unfortunatley it was cold so that feature wasn't open. The rooms weren't nearly as bad as some reviewers had written. Seriously, if you want a 4+ start experience, go to a 4 star hotel!\n\nThe hotel is located just a block off the strip behind MGM. We ended up having to take a cab anytime we were too lazy (heels) or cold to walk the strip, but overall we still saved tons of money. It would have been nice to stay on the strip but hey, you get what you pay for.\n\nThe staff is pretty nice but I will tell you, bar service at Mad Onion was super slow!\n\nWould I stay here again? Yes, if I want to have fun on a budget."

            "review": "Why did we do this? Why? What were we thinking? If we die here will anyone know we are missing? Will anyone care when they see where we were staying? These are all the questions that might cross your mind while you are staying at the Hooters hotel in Vegas. \n\nLet's be real here though. There are only a few reasons you are choosing to stay at Hooters in Vegas. 1. You spent way too much money getting there and doing activities that you didn't have enough money for a good hotel or you planned for the hotel way too late in the trip and this is one of your only options. 2. You want to see women with big breasts everywhere you walk and you don't get enough of that just walking down the strip, going to night clubs or strip clubs everywhere in the city. \n\nSo if its reason one and you are doing this for money reasons then honestly it's not too bad. The rooms aren't great. They are really motel type rooms with two beds and the bare essentials of amenities. You are just kind of happy to have walls and a door here and hopefully you will be at other places on the strip so it's not too bad. It's better than Riviera because at least some of the things they promise you actually work. Also if you are going with a large group or don't really want to do much on the strip this is a good option because it's the cheapest option that is someone technically still on the strip. So if you are here for a conference or event and you don't mind Hooters showing up on your invoice then it's not the worst. \n\nIf the second reason is the reason you came to Hooters hotel then enjoy being in the mecca of scantily clad women and bad decisions. It feels like a hooters restaurant that you can stay in. Really though I would recommend the playboy hotel or you know just going outside if you want to see women that badly. If you are looking to be on the strip and party and have the option please just go ahead and fork over the extra 50 to 100 dollars a night and stay somewhere on the strip. If you don't care about any of that then this isn't a bad option. \n\nThis is that next day conversation with the one night stand you regret sleeping with. You knew what this was when you signed up for this. You aren't happy but you aren't really sad either. You had fun and you really wouldn't tell anyone else about what happened or why you ended up here. Just accept what this is and that nothing really matters because it's Vegas."

The maid did not come once while we were there and when we would call for more towels we would get one or two from a worker that would drop them off like we were an inconvenience to him. We also called for a roll away bed that they sent with the sheets on top for us to apply and no pillows. My account was over charged when I left and I spoke to the manager Imelda. Who was unbelievably rude and unprofessional. I told her that her employee had told me a different price and she proceeded to talk over me and tell me that it doesn't matter what her employee stated. She also told me how they already charged my card so pretty much too bad for me. I have never been treated like that by a \"manager\" of a hotel before.

Wings. \n2. classy decor, with the signature logo (which is universally known as a sign of sophistication) and the surf-shack meets small town strip club theme.\n3. Hooters girls manning the table games and wandering around the place like lost little aerobics instructors - omg, those socks make my heart race.\n4. Pool - three pools of differing temperatures, sweet waterfall, and premixed tasty tropical drinks (with admittedly less alcohol than I would like). \n5. Rooms - are nice, clean, orange and have comfortable beds.\n6. The Dam - A diner with a very educational theme- the Hoover Dam. Hey, it's a big deal, ok. Its an exact replica of a rocky mountain diner experience, complete with cracked-out looking waitresses in ugly gray uniforms serving decadent burgers, and they got you covered for breakfast with a great buffet. But what happened to the frosted flake french toast???\n7. Sense of humor - dont go to vegas without it. While most other hotels try to convince you that simply staying there and spending your money on their casino, overpriced rooms and nightclubs make you a sexy celebrity, Hooters does not front. You know you like scantily clad, cute but not TOO attractive girls serving you onion rings and dealing your blackjack. Hooters has a sense of irony and doesnt take itself too seriously and that makes the Vegas thing more relaxing and enjoyable.\n8. Did i say wings?\n9. Gift store- bring the old lady home a t shirt and she'll forget about that hooker you accidentally killed during a bachelor party.\n10. Dan Marino Steakhouse - need I say more?\n\nthings i could live without - dudes at the pool bar whistling every time a girl walks by (even me, so you know they arent even picky), long waits at the Hooters restaurant, room rates have increased significantly for the weekend since last summer. Other than that, its delightfully tacky yet...totally fun."

Our view from the room, facing towards the strip, was nice. \nCONS: The place is defiantly older, not renovated in a while or ever. Floors were extremely dirty all over, casino floor, elevator, hallways, rooms. All of it. No one told us how to get to our rooms so we had to search. Rooms were dirty, floors, bathroom. Ironing board had a huge stain, along with the chair cushion. No chair for the vanity but had a random table that worked good enough to sit on. Very outdated television and smoke detector. Decor in the room was all wood, cheap looking, and very \"undelightfully tacky.\" Towels didn't seem to match. Curtains were broken. AC was incredibly loud and not that cold. Shower head had good pressure but came out in a small stream. Almost like showering with a hose. \nThe list goes on and on. The only thing that makes this a little better than a Super 8 is that this place has a restaurant and a casino. Nothing special."

Part of running a successful business would be to make sure their customers are happy even if it is at a more \"reasonable\" price, right?\n\nCheck-in was easy, but once I got to my room, it wasn't ready.  It looked pretty trashed and the maid was just starting to clean the room.  I could understand if I got there early, but their check-in time is 4:00 and I was there about 4:30-4:45.  I went back downstairs with all my luggage and waited a good 10 minutes to be waited on so I could tell the girl at the front desk that the room she gave me was not ready.  She at least upgraded me and waived 1-days worth of the resort fee, but she was pretty unapologetic, but I was okay with it.\n\nSo with that, here's a list of good/bad/what to look out for:\n\nGood:\n-Inexpensive\n-Wild Onion (I think that's the name) is pretty good and so was the service.\n-Hooters Restaurant, my first time dining at one.  Wasn't too bad, but it's what I expected.\n-Pool is okay to just lay out and relax.  Not like one of the party pools, but I was there during the week.\n-Hooters girls at the restaurant and pool were friendly.\n-Bed was comfy and decorations are okay.\n-It was actually better than the Hilton (surprisingly a horrible hotel).\n\nBad:\n-A lot of broken things (like elevator buttons or the lights to know which elevator is on its way)\n-I paid a little extra for drink vouchers by the pool and $10 discount at Wild Onion.  They didn't give me the vouchers and when I asked for them they didn't \"see\" it on my reservation and wanted to see my confirmation.  I wasn't going to go upstairs AGAIN for it.  I got them after speaking with the manager, but again unapologetic and didn't really seem to care.\n-AC in room was crazy loud.\n-Bathroom wasn't that clean (hair still on the floor).\n-Sink was clogged and a horrible screeching sound from the shower that sounds like a tea kettle once the water is boiling.\n-Not enough people working in valet, so a lot of waiting around for them.\n-Casino is really small.  I think they're adding on to it.\n-Hotel front-desk staff are not so friendly.\n-Incredibly loud if you wind up with a room with a shared door!  \n\nHopefully, once they're done remodeling (why they didn't do that when they opened?!) it'll be better.  But I came to find out I wasn't being picky.  During a conversation with other guests in the hotel, they noticed a lot of broken things and one said that the place is a POS and it's his first and last time staying there.  \n\nI might stay here again, but I think I'll save next time and stay at one of the nicer hotels/casinos."

My girlfriend sent her food back and after about 10 more mintues she get her food. \n\nShe goes to move her pickle out from under her fries (because come on who puts a cold pickle under fries right?!), and much to both of our surprise there is a 3 inch long piece of black hair stuck to her pickle.

We say no we dont want to we want to leave. So he says were more than welcome to leave our food has been comped. \n\nSo we leave as we are leaving, I see David talking to another guy who keeps looking over at me, and nodding his head so I stop. David walked back over to me, and I asked what the problem was. He said nothing but you are more than welcome not to return to the resturant. I asked him why he said oh because we obvisiouly cant make you people happy. Ok fine. \n\nI go back today and speak with Bill the general manager. He also tells me every time you people are in here theres always an issue. You are always talking to a manager or complaining about something. It would be in your best interest not to come back. \n\nOk first off the customer is always right, secondly you people is kind of demeaning to me and I take that as an insult. third I myself and my girlfriend know most of the people in the resturant personally that why were always talking to managers. \n\nI WILL NOT be returning to hooters anymore until the higher management staff is changed or they will admit they were in the wrong.

The room had stains on the carpet, my bed sheet had stains, there was still someone else's hair on the shower wall and large dust bunny in the bathroom, cracked sink and torn shower curtain that was way too short for the tub. Rusted door hinges on the bathroom probably because there is no venting system to pull out the steam. The ac is an old wall ac that was too loud I thought I would break at any time. The furniture was scraped up and we had a nice view to the pool but it was obstructed by the filth on the windows.

For the price I would not stay here again unless all these things were fixed and the rooms were better quality."

Concerning the bar and restaurant on a Saturday night...slow bar service and oblivious bartenders. Wings were average, and certainly no comparison to our Chicagoland spots. Long waits for drinks, both at the bar and the table, were disheartening. Small hotel makes for a crowded lobby jammed with slots. For the price, it's possibly of value; however not what we look for in our Vegas Vacations..."

My brother is so cheap that he still wears shirts from when he was in High school, (he is currently 36). Regardless we thought 3 *s (official rating on most websites) all we really need is 2 beds and a bathroom. Well being blunt if this is 3 Stars then I think the box under the bridge with the homeless must rank at least 2 stars! there was no chair for the desk (how did that leave the room?) the decor looked like Jimmy buffet threw up after drinking one too many different colored margaritas, the carpet was just dirty, the bathroom had mold in the corners of the linoleum floor, There was a foot hole kicked through the bathroom door.

If you like Hooters in your hometown, you will love this Hooters! This is an old Howard Johnson's hotel from the 70's, but over the years it has been owned and remodeled by several different owners with the latest being Hooters. You may want to get there quickly if you want to visit because the hotel is up for sale, which is unfortunate because it is really cute, fun and inexpensive for a hotel just off the Las Vegas strip. It is decorated in a \"Florida-tropical\" theme with the two hotel towers and a large outdoor pool area with three pools and three hot tubs, as well as a bar. The hotel and rooms are very clean and adequate. There is a tv, but no mini-frig or microwave. I would have given this resort and casino 5 stars had the rooms had a refigerator, microwave and newer flat screen tv's. Being that they filed and emerged from bankruptcy in 2012, I can see why they are being careful and frugal with their hotel. That being said, the location is great. It's right next door to the Tropicana and right across the street from the MGM Grand. A traffic light allows easy crossing to the MGM Grand casino and access to the monorail, so you can get anywhere on the strip from this hotel. There is also city bus service at the Tropicana next door if you want to take buses, which are way cheaper than taxis ot the monorail. They are on-time and come by frequently. A taxi will cost you $10 plus tip to go around the corner to the airport, while the bus in $2. The Hooters restaurant inside the casino has a special (not on the menu) of 3 chicken tacos for $3 and they are really great. They come mild, medium or hot. The only way you know about this special is a sign at the front door of the casino, so you have to ask for it once inside the restaurant.. The rooms are inexpensive compared to other hotels on or near the strip, so it is a great value for a basic, clean room in a great location. There is a Prince review there called Purple Reign, which we did not see, but people we talked to in the casino loved it. It was not showing the nights we were there or we would have gone to see it. I suggest you give this hotel and casino a try if you like a budget, no frill but clean room. You won't be disappointed."

How a high quality show like that drew Hooter's as venue is beyond me.  \n\nIn part, it is like visiting an actual Hooter's.  There are scantily clad waitresses everywhere with those bright orange short shorts and bursting cleavage.  The sports bar in the back is filled with cliched men literally hooting and hollering at each dramatic turn of the basketball game being aired.  Guy's guys carrying on and enjoying the holy trinity of sports, alcohol, and women.  I definitely felt out of place.  The nightclub was especially theatric with the female bartender climbing the rack above the bar and hanging upside down serving drinks to the largely male clientele.  She even did a number where she hung with her legs suspended and invited men to place their head between her thighs from the backside so she could give them shots individually.  So, yeah, not exactly a sophisticated cocktail lounge in Manhattan.  If this is your thing, enjoy.  I will be at other, classier casinos on the strip."

When we arrived on our floor, we could not help but notice the foul smell. There were bags full of trash and soiled linens in the hallway. Our room was also a disappointment. The carpet looked filthy, the walls needed paint, the mattress was horrible, and the shampoo was half empty. The furniture was also in poor condition. The night stands has graffiti carved into the wood. Also, during our stay we were walking back to our room and a housekeeping employee behind us started yelling obscenities to another employee down the hall. She startled us so we turned around and looked at her. I think she realized what she was doing and stopped but we thought that was a little unprofessional. Needless to say we were very disappointed with our stay and will most likely not return. We also had friends staying there and they confirmed that their stay was just as bad. My opinion of the hotel is that it needs a lot of maintenance and staff training. And definitely shouldn't brand it as a \"resort\" with \"resort fees\". This establishment is no where near resort level and nor should you keep deceiving customers with such a label. This is just a big, overpriced, ghetto roach motel."

Yes, rooms were really outdated to the point that a scary movie can be filmed there. I was okay with that but then more things started accumulating. No hot water in the room, a pile of garbage at the entrance of the building (including a cockroach), no fridge as listed on the hotel's website, no hair conditioner.

Because of the weekend the rates jumped up to $92 (with taxes and resort fee through Travelocity) a night. It was the best deal out there!! We stayed one night, and I was pretty please with the hotel. The checkin staff were very friendly. Checkin is 4pm, but our room was ready a hour before, so it's good to ask!!! The girl was very quick with checking us in, and by 3:15 we were in our room. The room itself IS somewhat outdated, but it's Hooters and the theme is wooden Florida atmosphere. We had a nonsmoking double beds, which was perfect. The room itself was pretty clean, so I never saw any stains or anything. Their casino is small but it's nice cause it's quick to find where you need to go! The casino staff were very friendly as well. We ate at Hooters for lunch and also for breakfast the next morning! Sign up for the play club, because you get free play (I didn't win though, I suck at gambling) and $5 off a meal! Lunch was fine and pretty quick! I had a buy one get one wings, and basically it tasted like Hooters wings! The fried pickles were the best I've had at any Hooters. Breakfast was really good surprisingly as well! I had a Bloody Mary with mine! The convenience store is open 24/7, so you can get your Krispy Kremes and beer when you need it. Prices aren't bad at Hooters and the store. The Hooters girls are pretty friendly, except there was one who had a terrible attitude who worked in their Hooters merch store. You could tell she hated her job. Other than that though it was fine.\nLocation is great because you are across the street from the MGM entrance. We spent a lot of time in MGM honestly. Fat Tuesdays is there also, along with 2 monorail entrances. Also very close to Luxor and Excalibur. \nI am returning in mid March for spring break and I am staying at Hooters once again! I scored an awesome 2 night deal through Travelocity for $85! We will be spending time at Hakkasan and some other places! It's just a room honestly, and how often are you in it? It's cheap but saved you money for drinks and going out!"

If you enjoy the smell of warm vomit as you walk back to your hotel room then by all means book a room here.\n\nI stayed here with some girlfriends because we got a free room and even though it was free it was hard not to complain. The hotel is a run down dump. The only highlight was how much time we didn't have to stay in the room!! \n\nWe did have a pool view from our room but no one seemed to be partaking in poolside fun. The room service was prompt but the food was horrendous. Basically for $10 you get a reheated chicken patty with plastic processed cheese and soggy fries that look like they were scraped from the neighbors plate they left in the hall.\n\nUnless you must, must, must stay here don't and I hope the next time I have to see this place it is when they are building a new hotel over it."

So, of course, it was in great condition. The beds were super comfortable and everything was clean.  I stayed here about three years later and you could tell they are not on top of the upkeep.  The parking structure elevator needs some heavy repairs and the hallways need to be cleaned. But if you're just going to Vegas to party, sleep, eat, party, sleep, eat...then the 20 bucks you'll pay for weekday rates is well-worth the price.  If you snub your nose at the Luxor, don't even think about staying here.  Still, this is a much better place and location than Circus Circus and definitely Stratosphere.  I'll be back....mostly cause I have my cheap moments."

The dealers weren't overly talkative or friendly and seemed uninterested.  The rooms are nothing special and the hallways have a funky fried food smell to them but you can pick up a room for around $25 a night during the weeknights off season.

Nothing too special, except the overpriced room service. They showed palm trees in the room they had photographed on their website, but my room didn't have any.\n\nThey do have multiple restaurants here, as well as a show nobody I talked to seemed to care about. The Mad Onion has some good prices -- $9.99 for a prime rib dinner. Then there are multiple bars here serving cheap drinks. The theme here is $3 everything: blackjack; beer; and margaritas.\n\nThe pool area is easily the best part of this hotel. It's so relaxed and calm, even if the occasional airplane or helicopter flies overhead. If you're done gambling and drinking, this is a good place to chill and catch some rays.\n\nThe casino is small and \"delightfully tacky\". You have Hooters girls as the dealers. Some are attractive, others not so much. Some are actually helpful and actually want you to win, while others just don't care. You'll learn soon enough which dealers are there to help you, though.\n\nThe slots are advertised as \"loose\", but don't expect to win much of anything. There's also a small William Hill sports book here. I won a $50 bet taking the Miami Heat to cover the spread (which they barely did), so that's always a good thing.\n\nThe location is top-notch. While this is a middle-of-the-road casino and hotel, its location down the street from the heart of the Strip makes it a great place to stay if you want to save money."

Seriously, $20 for a night plus 20 free wings, buy-one-get-one-free steak dinner for $10, and 2 free drinks at the pool bar were too good of a bargain.  My grandparents in Hong Kong would have crossed the Pacific Ocean for a Vegas deal that good.  A discount so prime that it almost masks the decrepit halls of this tacky establishment, home of daytime escorts and resting ground for strippers that just couldn't cut it.  If you came to the casino floor for pretty girls, prepare to be gravely disappointed at the selection of just grotesque herd animals you've ever seen.  They keep the prime stock in the Hooters Restaurant.\n\nBut seriously Hooters Girls, some of you are hot, but don't give my group fucking attitude while we order and act like you have so many important places to be in your empty restaurant.  Your unresolved issues of Daddy touching you inappropriately and that oh-so-interesting theory that hardcore porn is the \"gateway to Hollywood\", while amusing, should be checked at the door.  Although the blonde at the bar was especially nice to me and the gf.  You are an gentle-lady and a scholar.\n\nThe $3 Blackjack tables that they advertise like the saggy boobs of their older staff actually consist of ONE, yes ONE, table that is always full.  Comped drinks come at an excruciatingly slow pace since the table limits are so low they need to make money somehow, amiright?\n\nThe $.99 wings they advertise are also only available to hotel guests and only with the purchase of a drink.  Although you see $1.50 bud lights being hawked on the floor, the price increases in restaurants like Mad Onion where the wing deal is offered.\n\nOverall, the rooms were okay.  Not the worst that I've stayed in Vegas.  Twas fairly roomy and felt like a retired grandpa from Florida decorated everything with a tropical theme: a grandpa with debilitating Alzheimer's.  The beds were kind of musty, but sheets and room were cleaned daily.  Bathroom was kind of small and old, but what do you expect for $20.  It's a pretty alright place for being right next to the strip.\n\nTL;DR\nAt least it ain't the fucking Circus Circus"

I stayed here one night under a comp from work, probably wouldn't go back on my own dime though to stay here. \n\nThe front desk staff was pretty nice and quick about getting us our rooms, but once i got up the room i was not impressed at all. The room is outdated (expected it from pictures online). I do like that, for the most part, it was clean. I found the bed to be decent at best, definitely not anything to rave about, but it wasn't disgusting by any means\n\nDownstairs in the casino area is pretty fun though. They still had the $1.50 Bud Light special i heard some friends talking about when i got there so i had a couple of those and then some fries to snack on downstairs. Not the best place to grab food i must say, but you can't beat $1.50 beer! The bar tenders are always nice too, very quick and efficient and they don't screw up anything. Always checking up to make sure my group didn't need anything as well. \n\nLooked like lots of people were enjoying the pool, which did look pretty cool, especially at night. It wasn't a bunch of rowdy drunks either, most of the people seemed to just be relaxing and having a good time poolside with some drinks. \n\nThe location of the hotel isn't that great. It's just slightly off the strip, the MGM is right across if you want to take the monorail, but you'll probably need a Taxi to go to any of the bigger hotels. But then again, that's why this hotel is by no means pricey. \n\nAll in all, i think the Hooters hotel is a better place to hang out, gamble and have drinks than it is to stay. If you want a budget room than this hotel isn't bad, you'll get a decent room at a really good price. But this is definitely more of a party and bar place then it is a hotel to me."

The shower in our room wouldn't drain and quickly filled up with water. I tried taking a pen and cramming it down the drain to see if I could fix it - I pulled the pen out and a hunk of foul hair and gunk came with it. \n\nThe drain was plugged up with some bitch's entire weave or something... perhaps a dog. We called down to the front desk and were transferred to the wrong department, transferred to a voice mail, and hung up on twice before we were able to get them to send someone out. \n\nThey sent out two maintenance guys to fix it and they spent a half hour blowing air down the drain with a hand pump. This did nothing. They left saying it was still slow, but working a little better. It didn't. All it did was make us late. \n\nIt wasn't just the bathtub malfunction that was a problem... the place was disgusting. There was some sort of small turd near the entry. The vent in the bathroom looked like there was a 1000 year old dead rat inside. The air conditioner sounded like an asthmatic and the busted tile beneath it was covered in dirt. There were all sorts of stains all over the carpet and anything with a surface was covered in layers of old dirt... tops of door frames, mirrors, headboards, etc... \n\nEvery shower curtain ring was broken as well - it felt like some sort of joke - like we were on some sort of reality show... someone just wanted to see us crack.\n\nSadly... the room was 150 per night because we got there on a busy weekend I suppose. Other people online had reported paying in the 30s for their room. I wouldn't have felt right paying 30 any more than I felt right paying 150. I took pictures of everything and brought them downstairs in the morning to the manager who acted relatively nice. I showed her the pictures on my camera and she had me wait to show her head of cleaning staff who looked at them and shrugged at me dismissively.\n\nIn the end, they comped my room. They should've given us tickets to something or gambling money or offered a free night in one of their nicer suites. Had they done anything more than comped the room, I would've tried to be a little more understanding. As it stands though, they did not. \n\nI paid nothing for this room in the end, and it damn near ruined my vacation. It's not worth it at 150, 90, 60, 30 dollars... not even zero. \n\nIf you're a college kid who is happy drinking Bud, your idea of 'ballin' is winning 50 cents in the penny slots, and you are in Vegas to throw televisions through windows and pee in the hallway... you have found your ideal hotel. For a cheap thrill, get in the elevator and ride it as high as it will go - you will fear for your life.\n\nFuck this place."

(Not reviewing the hotel or casino itself)\n\nHooters is extremely close and convenient for when I get off of work around midnight. My friend and I went there for some cheap prime rib, assuming the Mad Onion was still open. Unfortunately, even though it was Friday night, the Mad Onion was closed. The only thing open that served food was the Hooters bar and restaurant so we dragged our feet there, expecting the worst.\n\nUsually when I go to the 'open all night' restaurants in the casinos, either the food or service is terrible, and I just assume it's because of the late hour and the servers and kitchen staff have already mentally checked out.\n\nWe were actually pleasantly surprised. The food was amazing. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich with teriyaki sauce and fries and my friend got a cheesesteak sandwich. I can't convey enough how much this wasn't your typical late night food. Everything tasted so fresh and delicious. My friend said it was one of the best cheesesteaks he has ever had.\n\nThe service was even better. Given the hour and locale, we just expected sub par service. Our server, Karissa, was pleasant, enthusiastic and very helpful. (She obviously loves her job. Getting served by someone who hates their life is never fun.) She checked on us regularly and made our Hooters experience that much more enjoyable. Someone get that girl a raise.\n\nI'm happy to say that I found a new post-work eatery and will definitely be back."

We originally booked the hotel through Hotwire.com over 2 months before the trip, so didn't know which hotel we were committing to, but it showed as 3 star hotel, on the strip, with 3.5 stars on TripAdvisor, so we booked it. Was going on a golf trip with 2 other guys, so Hooters was fine when we found out. \n\nProblem started at checkin. They didn't have our reservation, and said Hotwire didn't fax it. The girl at the front desk said, nothing they could do, \"next time book directly through us\". Seriously? I ask if they can call Hotwire for me - 'can't do that'. I was surprised at the attitude and inhospitality. I asked to speak with the manager - she wasn't available to talk to us. I ask if they can at least get us in a room, I'll give them my credit card number - I have confirmation number, reservation number, everything Hotwire sent me to confirm I went through and paid for this room already. \n\nWhile at the desk, I called Hotwire, where I was on hold for over 20 minutes. When someone finally came on, they transferred me and refaxed (they said their records showed originally faxed in June). They couldn't stay on the line with me, so waited (all the while, I'm waiting at the registration desk). I waited for another 10 minutes, it never came through, so had to call Hotwire again (again Hooters tells me, nothing they can do, I need to call them, and ask them to fax it again). They said they didn't even have Hotwire's phone number. While on hold, ask to speak to the manager again, this time she was available, this is where things started to really fall apart. She essentially said \"that's what I get for booking through a 3rd party\", I didn't even know how to respond to that. She said nothing they could do. When I finally got Hotwire on again, they again refaxed (I can't believe they're doing all this via fax). This time the Hotwire person stays on the line with me. Another 10 minutes later, Hooters finally gets it. \n\nJust to upset us more (it seemed), the counter person checks in the next group in line instead of us.\n\nAll in all, I get into the hotel room over 2 hours after we got to the Hooters. No apologies, just a bad attitude. I would have been fine if they were polite about the whole matter, I understand things go wrong with technology. But to blame me for making reservations not directly through them, to be rude (not just from staff, but from the manager), unbelievable. \n\nBTW, hotel is in terribly old, run down condition (this is in the old San Remo), the dealers were rude, and the elevators smelled."

The tile looked very old and the shower was uncomfortable. \n\nThe linens and towels felt hard and cheap.\n\nI can forgive a lot of things, but being one of the biggest chains in the restaurant business and taking pride in the esthetics of their restaurants I expected a lot more from the \"remodel\" from it's previous property the San Remo.\n\nEven though I read this article http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/dec/28/eight-changes-coming-hooters-casino-hotel/#axzz2YA4Oq4Fo \n\nI am still very apprehensive to return to this hotel.

The hotel is centrally located, across the MGM Grand Hotel.  Hooters is definitely showing its age though.  The carpeting, wall fixtures, rooms, and general appearance is showing significant wear and tear.  the hotel is in need of a facelift.  The rooms are clean but showing that 90's look--including  tube TV.  That being said, Hooters is probably the best value hotel you will find adjacent to the strip (Technically it's 1-blk off the strip on Tropicana).  The hotel offers nice pools with a full service bar, a sandy beach area,hot tub, scantly clad Hooters Girls, and party music.   Gambling is cheaper too with $3 black jack.  Located inside Hooters, is the Mad Onion restaurant.  Mad Onion serves a very good prime rib dinner, cooked to order prime rib, with a baked potato, steamed vegetables, and roll w/ butter for $9.95.  We ate there three nights and really liked it.  Hooters is a 3-star hotel,  presenting 4-star value.  Hooters is a Vegas frat house oriented party hotel.  If you've come to Vegas to party, eat, drink on the cheap, to enjoy the strip and just need your room to serve as \"home base\" to recharge, than Hooters is your place.  If you want the luxurious Vegas hotel room experience, stay elsewhere and pay a lot more."

The hotel and casino are relatively small so everything is conveniently located, just a hop, skip and a jump from your room to the casino to the pool or parking garage. The prices are a hit or miss, sometimes they have really great deals and sometimes they are just downright terrible. They have a 24 hour gift shop (located next to the elevators of the two towers of the hotel) that has munchies, moonshine and gifts, which is nice. They have a few restaurants which are open a little late but do close so if the tummy starts to growl after a night of partying you might want to grab something to eat on the way back to the hotel or you'll starve. There really isn't anywhere to party in this resort. It is more of a gamble, sleep, repeat kind of place. The pools are relaxing, the beds are comfy and the views are decent...perfect for those that are in Vegas for a chill weekend."

A day or two after they were married we decided to take them to lunch. They were staying at the Monte Carlo so not a long walk at all. We were seated within 15 minutes of arriving so that was fine; they were busy. We order some light beers assuming the food would be served soon. It took about 45 minutes. The server came by and said \"I'm sorry the crab legs are holding up the order.\" She leaves then me and the groom start talking about why the crab legs would take long... you throw them in boiling water for a few minutes and done. So, the food finally comes and even before cracking the crab open I could tell it was over cooked. We crack a leg open and it looked like the crab was put in a food dehydrator as to suck any last piece of moisture and flavor out of it. It was actually inedible. I ask the waiter to get the manager. I explained that I don't often complain about the food but that the crab was inedible. He explaines that he'll \"comp\" it like he's doing me a favor. I hand the dish to him as to say \"no, take this crap away from me.\" He tries to get us to order something else. I explain to him that we're not wanting to wait another 45 minutes for poor food. He should have actually reduced the bill, brought us another beer, promised to have the chef re-do the crab legs the right way which should only take 10 minutes or less... something. But no, nothing. You couldn't pay me to go back into that place."

I guess the reason the rate was so good is this hotel and its tiny casino is in pretty severe need of a refresh and deep cleaning. The whole place just seemed dingy.\n\nThat said, the room was a pretty standard Vegas hotel room. Ours had two full-sized beds (they called them queen but no) and a 25\" old-school TV (tube). There was no mini fridge. Nice coffee machine, though, that uses the coffee pods for making individual cups of coffee. \n\nShower had decent water pressure which was nice but they only supplied us with a total of two towels so if we had had kids with us we would have needed more. The sample-sized shampoo and conditioner bottles are tinier than any I have ever seen so I suggest you bring your own from home.\n\nThe beds were more comfortable than I expected.\n\nThere are a couple restaurants in the hotel, one of which I will review separately. \n\nThe pool area is not especially large and there are not nearly enough lounge chairs. There were a LOT of families staying there with children running all over the pool area. We were somewhat irritated by the security guards telling us that we could not drink our drinks that we had acquired while elsewhere on the strip while laying by the pool. These drinks were in plastic containers. We were told that we MUST purchase our drinks from the pool-side bar. This was rather annoying given that one of the hallmark experiences of Vegas is that you can walk about with alcohol in your hand. That really soured our experience overall with this hotel.\n\nThe casino's poker room has ONE table. I didn't play any poker this weekend but would probably not play there unless the antes are low. There are a few gaming tables and quite a few slots including many of the latest ones. \n\nThe hotel is walking distance to the strip which was a key reason for selecting it. \n\nAll in all this was not a bad place to stay but was certainly not the best. Given that they are NOT right on the strip I would think they would try harder to have a better experience for their guests. I sorta felt like we were unimportant to them."

Avoid staying here at all costs.  Im giving it two stars only because the casino has really low limits on there tables.  And the pool actually looked descent.   So i requested a Non smoking king bed room in their tower for a pretty good deal.  This is how i was lured in (low prices) we were working with a budget this trip.  I get there to check in and they tell me they don't have a non smoking king room in the tower.  (even though i had called a few days prior to make sure it was reserved)  Idiots !!\nSo i settle with a smoking king room on the 3rd floor.  Get in the room and the first thing i notice is the industrial AC unit for the whole casino/hotel is outside our balcony and its humming like a tractor. FUCKKK NO !!  so i go ask for a new room right away.  Finally a different guy gets us a non smoking room w/ king bed in the tower on the 10th floor.  much better, but still the rooms are only a step above motel 6.   \n\nTip: you end up spending more money taking cabs to the strip every night than it would cost to upgrade to a nicer hotel/casino.  Spend the extra cash to get a better room at a better hotel.  \n\nThe food was ok, takes a long time for a \"to go\" order.\nbeers were cheap.\n\nbottom line: stay somewhere else if you can afford it.

Go anywhere else that has better corporate values and cares about their customers. This place is run down, poorly managed, will give you food poison, and simply it's the worse casino in Las Vegas."

First off Hooters casino is budget option style accommodation, not meant to compete with the Bellagio, Palazzo etc. Our room was clean the bed comfortable. The pillows were a bit hard and odd shaped but hey you can't have your own bedding when traveling. The A/C was very loud also but other than that we were very happy with the room. \n\nThe pool was great, the area only gets sun till 2-3pm so hit it early. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The summer bonus items; 10 free wings, free money for slotz which we won $120 was great and the $1 for $1 on the tables up to $15 was great. They offer you many great add ons and also offer free wifi resort wide which I didn't get when I stayed at Planet Hollywood for 4 times the price!\n\nThe location is only a small walk from the strip. It's opposite MGM and you can walk through there to access the strip.\n\nIf you want to save some money or just don't have a tonne of it, this casino resort is a great option."

Yes the casino is small. Yes the rooms do not compare to the likes of the bellagios, mandalay bays, etc.  But I have never had a bad experience at the hoot. The staff has always been amazing and attentive. Check in is always quick and easy. The rooms I've stayed in have never had the issues that other pics on here show. They recently renovated the pool area. I personally liked it better as it was before. There's no longer a bar area at the pool but theres an adjacent bar that is connected to hooters restaurant where you can easily walk into to grab drinks. They have a dj going on the weekends to live up the atmosphere. All in all hooters know what they are and do it pretty good. I'll continue to stay at the hoot as long as they keep taking care of me with free room offers in my emails."

If you stay there long enough, you'll start getting harassed to open a players card with them. All in all, it was a fun experience and I plan on frequenting that particular casino, since it sure has brought me some good luck.\n\nGreat atmosphere and easy going waitresses. Lots of good looking waitresses, so you won't have a problem maintaining eye contact. I got some snow crab legs and my friends got wings. This is the first time I ever single handedly just ordered crab legs and I have to say that the crab legs were very tasty!They have a great money saver deal where you buy 10 wings and get 10 more for free."

Absolutely! \n\nHubs and I paid approximately $20 per night which is a bargain. Yes there are $7.50 resort fees but that brought our stay up to $27.50 per night... still a total bargain in my book. \n\nAhead of checking in we requested a non smoking room away from the elevators and got 1147 which was an awesome room in the Ocean Tower with a great view of the strip. The room was clean. Yes it was old looking and there were some odd stains on the carpet, but who comes to Vegas to stay in their room?? Not me that's for sure! \n\nWe didn't use the pool facilities (Wet Republic at MGM is right across the street, if you want a fab pool go there). But the Mad Onion and Hooters restaurant were great, good food and good value for money. \n\nThe location was pretty awesome too. I like to walk as much as possible in Vegas and this was walking distance from the major hotels on the strip. Plus the bar has a great happy hour on beers, be sure to take advantage of these for pre-night out drinking in your room!\n\nI'd say if you just want a place to crash in and don't want to pay a lot for it, Hooters is perfect. Our experience was great. The staff were friendly when we asked for anything it was given and the location is awesome, everything is a short taxi or walk away."

This included:\na) Two free frozen alcoholic drinks \nb) Platter of 10 free wings\nc) $10 free slots play \nd) $10 free \"match play\"\n\n2) Sign up for a free card to play in the casino (necessary for your free slots play), and you'll get another coupon for $5 free \"match play\" and $5 free (price of a beer) at the restaurant.\n\n3) Check in offer at the bar - a free beer of your choice if you check in on Facebook or Twitter.

Another free plate of 10 wings!\n\n5) Sit at the bar when it's almost show-time, and there's a possibility a hypnotist will run by and hand you two free tickets.\n\nSo, overall, we made more money off Hooters during this trip than they made off us. This is my first time to Vegas, but I'm pretty sure this isn't how it's supposed to work. \n\nDefinitely worth a stay if you're a fan of good financial decisions."

They still sent up someone from engineering to change the battery, after which, the lock never worked AT ALL -- ever again. \n\nAs I waited in line at the front desk...again, to find out what was going on with the key, I met a couple who were having issues with their key, and they pointed out another couple who also couldn't get into their room.  It's an epidemic at Hooters!  \n\nFrom then on, they told us we would need to have security escort us to our room any time we needed to get back in.  Finally, they said they would send someone up to fix it, but it would be a while because they were changing shifts, and by the way, someone would have to wait in the room because engineering wasn't allowed to fix the lock without us present.  \n\nSo, here we are, chained to our room, waiting for someone to fix the lock-- did I mention, the engineer from earlier told me their programming equipment to fix the lock was broken, and they probably wouldn't be able to fix the lock until the next morning. \n\nWe called the front desk to request a new room.  After being told they were full, we talked them into giving us a suite.  Once, we got into our new room, the remote for the tv was broken, one of the lightbulbs in room was out, and there was a freaking cricket making a crapload of noise all night!.  AND the room was directly over the garbage, so all night i heard garbage trucks and had the pleasant aroma of rancid wings wafting in the window. \n\nThe absolute only good part about this hotel was the nice bell person, Sean, who took our bags to the new room, and the really nice craps dealers who made losing money a fun experience!  \n\nThanks Hooters, for making me cringe and cry every time I see the color orange."

The sheets had holes in them as well & the ac only has 2 modes, freezing & boiling. \n   My friend & I were too scared to walk ANYWHERE near that hotel & ended up having to take taxis everywhere bc we were consistently hassled every time we stepped foot out of the room. One of I taxi drivers was genuinely concerned about dropping us off at 'that sh*thole'. \nAll in all, if your women, DO NOT STAY THERE ALONE! It is frightening!!! I will never put myself in that situation again... I am surprised we walked out of there alive..."

The carpets and toilet were dirty as well. The AC worked well but parts were just hanging off. The glass was cracked on the closet door and the T.V. is a dinosaur. The pool is no longer open 24 hours either. The gambling area is so small and needs a major make-over. There are only 2 restaurants in this hotel. The positives are the staff was very friendly, Hooters Restaurant is open 24/7 and for the price it was very close to the strip. Overall, the negatives out way the positives and I would never stay at this hotel again. It felt worse than Motel 6."

I didn't expect much either because of the affordable price.  you shouldn't expect much either.\n\nCANCELLATIONS - a few nights before, we almost had to cancel our plans to vegas .... I called really late evening (around 1130pm) to cancel our reservation, and the operator was plain rude.  we reserved through expedia and expedia gave us their confirmation number and the hotel confirmation number.  my confirmation email specifically said to cancel through the hotel, and when you click the link, it takes you directly to hooters and gives you hooters number to call for cancellation.  it also says to cancel before midnight to to avoid any other fees.  I call at 1130pm, but the rude operator told me reservations are closed at this time and I'd have to call back in the morning??  she also told me rudely that i have to cancel through expedia, and after i told her expedia directed me to hooters, that's when she told me to call back in the morning (to speak to someone who actually knew the answers).  whatever ..... thank goodness we found out our plans came through, so VEGAS HERE WE COME!!\n\nCHECK IN - we checked in on a thursday around 5pm.  not busy at all.  of course, the girl (not lady) at the front desk didn't seem happy about working here.  not welcoming, no smile .... again, whatever .... WE MADE IT TO VEGAS!! \n\nHOTEL APPEARANCE - filthy elevators (garage and hotel elevators) .... the elevator doors to your hotel room are just nasty.  like housekeeping hasn't wiped them down in years .....I thought it would be wiped down by the next morning ..... nope!  filthy the whole time.  garage elevators seem like they will drop with you in it any time .... again, whatever .... I wasn't expecting much for an average $56 a night ..... \n\nroom is ok .... comparable to motel 6 .... one of the mattresses obviously needs to be replaced ...... the first thing we noticed was that the mattress was sunk in like an elephant sat on it for a month .... \n\nNO HOT WATER!!!  we're trying to get ready on a saturday morning around 9am to start our day.  FAIL!! I called housekeeping/engineering .... yes, they were aware the hot water wasn't working, and advised someone is working on it.  I asked how long it would be .... \"that, I don't know\"  .... again, RUDE .... at least throw in \"I'm sorry, I do apologize, but we don't have that information at this time\" .... after almost another hour of wasting the day away, I requested to use the shower in another tower (at least!!) so we can start our day.  thank goodness they were able to let that happen.  so, on with our late day in Vegas!\n\nCHECKOUT .... I didn't bother accompanying my husband to check out just so I can encounter another unhappy employee, but I did notice on the bill that we were comped our room service and daily service fees, which made me consider 2 stars.\n\nOVERALL .... you get what you pay for. like I said earlier, we didn't expect much, but I at least expected a decent experience.  no, I wouldn't come back, and I wouldn't recommend staying at this place, unless you like filthy establishments and rude employees."

If we got it, we were coming to LV, if not - we'd stay home. Friday night 5 pm- we won our bid @ HOOTERS HOTEL & CASINO. Not quite exactly how I envisioned my 1st time in LV, but I made the best of it. \n\nBUNGALOWS: WOW.. If you can, stay in the tower. I never got to see those rooms but anythings GOT to be better than this. The room itself was ok but felt like a room in the 80's in Miami. Like something out of Miami Vice. THe boards didnt quite meet together in the restroom, there wasnt a blow dryer? oh wait, found it in the closet. It too was from the 80's. But worst of all, there was no elevator to the 2nd floor in the bugnalows. THERE WAS NO ELEVATOR TO THE 2ND FLOOR IN THE BUNGALOWS. What the... We had to lug our luggage up the stairs. Glad I didnt pack the way I normally do. The bed wasnt that comfo but lets face it your 1st time in LV you're not spending that much time in your room. It was a great economical way to enjoy our LV trip. I'd give one star for the rooms alone. Literally Holiday Inn Express is nicer than this. They get an extra star b/c of Dan Marino's. \n\nGreat location! right across from the MGM and NYNY -you're entrance to the great strip. I think thats why I have a secret love for MGM. That and it reminds me of Tupac. I still miss that fool. \n\nDINING: Well we got in super late so we ate here @ Dan Marino's. Pleasant surprise! This place was freakin good! There was a long line of people waiting to eat and we thought wow, that's a long ass line, must be really good so we picked this place over the Hooters rest. in the back. Well turns out the line was waiting for some wing special at 11 or midnight that you get an obscene amt of wings for a low low price. We saw some lady walk out w/ literally 3 completely stuffed white strafoam boxes-- to the brim w/ wings. no shame - and she was by herself! \nI had the small ceasar salad w/ grilled ckn, super cheap like $7.99 and it was delicious. prob. 2nd best I've had next to Outback. thats another review!\nMy bf had the steak special and he loved it. SO much food for such small price $9.99. It was quality food too. not the left over meat they shovel out to you like @ Longhorn. I'd def. add this to my rotation if I was in the area more.'\n\nHOOTERS REST: blah. I've had better I've had worse. One girl insisted on jump roping w/ a guy @ the table and since I was the only gf there w/ 3 guys -(not my idea btw) she chose mine. He was upset I didnt stop it but it was a dbl edge sword. If I stopped it I'm THAT gf. If I didn't he was upset @ me for letting him look dumb. Oh well. I've been to several Hooters and this never happened. \n\nFREE $100 in slot play huh? Its a $100 bill they give you to play the roped off slots that are rigged not to win and you bet $10 a hand. No, nobody wins with this. Its funny. We've never been back since this. \n\nPOOL: The pool was the prettiest part of this place. Too bad I don't swim anyway."

We didn't use it but it was there. \nEverything else in the room/bathroom was standard to your basic room. But the room seemed unfinished. \n\nValet needs work. There is no desk or podium outside or a sign to where the valet person would be. So if no one is there you're SOL. \nOn our way out I called down to have my car pulled up before we got there. They said not necessary, they aren't busy. \nWe get down and no one is there I walk in to speak to the \"concierge\" and ask where the valet is. And she said \"oh there's one, you just have to find them or knock on the door\" literally what she said...which I think is BS. It wasn't even that hot outside. I was so irritated bc I should have to chase them down. Especially when I tried to call ahead. \n\nPool:\n-freezing! It was windy so that didn't help either lol \n-On day 1 we were able to take our pool towel up. On day 2 we weren't. Not consistent. \n-I like that they play music\n\nFitness center:\nWhat a joke. 2 treadmills but only 1 works. And 1 oliptical and 1 stationary bike the rest is weights. \n\nWe got what we paid for.

I guess so... \n\nIt was a regular ol room with two beds, the rooms were renovated which apparently entailed putting orange lamp shades over most of the lamps, changing it to a Florida feel, putting a little bit of wooden accents, and adding a hooters orange barstool.  All in all, nothing special but it did the trick... the elevators on the other hand were creepy and one of them broke once or twice the weekend we were there.. that's a no go!  \n\nThe service was ok, we could track down the cleaning ladies for towels in the morning... when we went to pick up our baggage from holding it took a good 20 minutes before I was able to reach over the desk, grab one of their walkie talkies, and finally press enough annoying buttons to get someone to notice what was going on... \n\nThe bad thing about the casino part is when you get their players card it's like a one time thing.  You can earn a billion points to get the owl that is impossible to buy but aside from that not a whole lot going on with the card.  When you first get it there's $200 in free slot play on their designated slots and a few coupons but after that you're out on a limb.  And you can't check your point balance online or anything so I don't really know how it benefits you once you're out of vegas... \n\nI love Hooter's really, got to take a ton of pictures with the random hooterness stuff like the escalade, hummer golfcart, and random surfboards... If I have to I'll stay here again but you have to walk across to MGM or farther if you want to get going Vegas status... Hopefully next time I'm in Vegas they don't lose another star =P"

It's not the MGM or Mandalay Bay - it's Hooters.  The room I stayed in was on the Ocean View tower (it's Vegas - there are no ocean views - I guess they meant pool).  The room was spacious.  The beds were doubles, not queens, but still comfortable.  There was just a sheet and a thin quilt on the bed, so maybe more sheets would have made it better.   The room was not a mess at all, and it didn't seem like it was falling apart.  It looked older and could be renovated, but it was still nice.   All except maybe the air conditioner, but it worked just fine. \n\nThe only bad thing was the lifts in our tower were not working, so you'd have to hike it to the next tower.  A little bit of an inconvenience, but not too bad.  I guess I wasn't drunk enough. \n\nI got a great deal on this place, so I'm not complaining.\n\nAgain, you get what you pay for."

Parking is a mess, there's a shady lot across the street that is also open for guests. \n\nWe got a double room, went up, it smelled like mildew and the carpet was wet in spots. Seriously? Tile around toilet was multi-colored, not in the good way. It looked like pee stain around the base of the toilet, but it was the messed up tile color. Hole/crack in the sink, way ghetto. We complained, they \"upgraded\" us to the 15th floor, same room, and gave us some drink coupons for the pool. Tiny beds, halfway between twin and full. Two small Asians in the bed was uncomfortable. Tub/shower clogged and took forever to drain. Cheap tv, no flat screen. But the carpet was better.\n\nFirst time going out we were going down the elevator and this two white trash guys get in with us holding a blunt. Reeked of weed, they start harassing my friend who's on the phone with her family. I tell them to back off and chill and all I remember was them yelling \"Merica.\" Really? Nice clientele. As we were walking out of the casino behind them, one of these classy gentlemen mooned us bare ass and all. Nice. \n\nThe only saving grace about this place was the pool. Surprisingly nice, and the free drink we got helped. Get the rum frozen drink. Nice and strong. I'd probably give a better review if I didn't pay a ridiculous price, maybe $25 a night and I'd understand. But $80? Hell no. Never again."

My former in-laws live in Vegas and I just wanted a halfway decent, inexpensive hotel to stay while I picked her up and visited. Going through Priceline, they must have gotten their H's confused, and I ended up booked at Hooter's. Non-refundable. No exchange. A-HEM. I called Hooters, and said, \"Listen, I'm traveling to see former-in laws with my 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, boobs is not what I intended for her to get in her mind as a career choice and this booking was a mistake\". They insisted they are \"FAMILY FRIENDLY\" and would not refund. \n\nFamily friendly, my ass. Tito and Jenna Jameson the Porn Star were all over. Boobage to the max, like staying in a filthy huge frat house with a four year old. Plus the undisclosed $15/day resort fee, ummm, for what? \nSo I can sit in Dan Marino's Grill and order a kid's hamburger for 10 bucks? Or so I can sit in my shabby, moldy smelling room in which the air conditioner broke? The A/C broke, people. We are in the flippin' DESERT. An entire day and half a night without A/C. \nThe engineer guy came up finally and fixed it in the middle of the night while my daughter was sleeping, and fortunately whatever blasted out of the vent didn't give us Legionnaire's disease...BUT...then....there was no water. The next day...full day was completely without water. Again, this is the DESERT. I called downstairs and was reassured that it wasn't just *me*, half the hotel was without water. Oh thank God, I thought I was hallucinating. I feel so much better. \n\nSo to distract myself from the fact that I am getting the shaft, I decide to go online, check email find games for Little Daughter to play. They say it's free, but when I tried to log on from the room, it's another $10! Oh man, if I didn't have high blood pressure before, I certainly have it now. I called downstairs, and they said, \"Well, it *is* free - some places around the pool you can catch a signal from the Motel 6\". So I was envisioning myself with a little tinfoil hat trying not to get my laptop splashed, walking in circles til I picked up Internet. They do thoughtfully provide electrical outlets right next to the pool in case you want to plug in and have some drunk trip over your cord and yank your new HP laptop into the pool.  Or perhaps they are offering do-it-yourself electroshock therapy (you supply the cord -they supply the outlet and water) to rev up that heartbeat.  Takes Vegas entertainment to a whole new level. \n\n\nLittle daughter splashed around in the ICY COLD pool until a sparrow somehow took a nosedive into it. It must have been shocked by the temp, as it couldn't seem to flutter up and out over the pool, and the waterfall kept buffeting it underwater. Suddenly, it got sucked into the drain thingie on the side of the pool. Maybe that's how Hooter's gets their wings. Anyhow, it was too far to reach, so, I couldn't let Little Daughter down by not saving the bird. I jumped out, took a few steps to uncover the closest filter lid and managed to reach birdie before she drowned. YAY! She dried off under a bush for a few minutes before flying off. That's my only happy Hooters story, and it's all about me saving a little bird. \n\nLet me get back to flipping  the bird to Hooters. In the end I got stuck with a bill over $400 for total CRAP. NEVER AGAIN. \nZERO STARS. \nI hope it comes crashing down and all the boobs deflate like flaccid balloons. \nEverytime we pass a Hooter's, Little Daughter points and yells \"Mommy - that means boobies!  Why are yours small?\" \nDie Hooters. Just die."

Secondly,  the majority of the hotel staff at the front desk lacked any type of genuine courtesy or portrayed what you'd expect from Hooters.  Third, and some may get offended,  but the place is Hooters and in Las Vegas my girlfriend and I were expecting amazing eye candy everywhere and yes \"Hooters\".  Most of the girls had \"Tweeters\".  Doubt I'd have a false advertising claim.  Fourth, were the room contents.   TV Cable never worked it was always snowy.   The room had no fridge,  even low-end motel 6 gives a fridge without asking.  The air-conditioning unit was loud.   Fifth, the glass windows in the room dirty.  The rooms just could have been cleaned better and smelled fresher.   Sixth,  the hotel had no music entertainment or even a dj.  Seventh, the overall hotel smelled old.\n\nThe positive was that we were in walking distance to the strip, MGM, and the Tropicana."

People who work at the front desk, restaraunt, maintenence & engineering and phone operators. I did not gamble and I don't drink.\n\nIt wasn't until the day before my flight that I decided to read some reviewsand all I found was negative things. it spooked me, but still, everything was already paid for so I followed through. \n\nI learned on youtube how to inspect a room for bed bugs when you get there. And how to prepare your belongings before you leave. Thankfully all was good. No bed bugs. At least, not in my room.\n\nHowever!\n\nWhen I got there my toilet was backed up. Gross! Picked up the phone and dialed 0 for the operator. There was no waiting time or music. An immediate answer. I like that. It only took the maintenence guy 5 minutes to arrive with a plunger. He had a good ense of humor about it. But the plunger wasn't enough so he went back out and in only another 5 minutes was back with a snake. Mission accomplished! He'd fixed it. He even insisted on finding something to make it smell good. More importantly, it stayed fixed. \n\nHe did return on Friday to replace the air conditioner that was only blowing hot air. It took me 2 nights to realize it because I rarely spent time in the room and so I hdnt tried to use it. Agan great service making the call, quick response time and a quick replacement time.\n\nThe restaraunt was great. I only ate at The Onion Grill because I'm not into the greasy party food places. And so yes, The Onion Grill had decent food at a bargain price. I'm consistenly focused on improving my eating habits sincee I've been engaged in working out with P90X, Insanity, RevAbs and now moving on to Body Beast. All available at FitnessCompensation.com And being that I was on a budget, it seemed just right for me. The service was always better than Id expected. Seated quickly and never felt rushed while I was at the table. The food tasted great and was delivered quickly.\n\nOh.. Before I forget..\nThe room had a few large stains on the carpet. Looked as if the room had been rearranged or renovated. The wood lining on the walls, the mattress and boxspring under it and the wooden furnature was all new. The rug wasn't new though, and I noticed it.\n\nIn a nutshell..\nDespite the room needing a few fixes, which were handled promply. I enjoyed my stay overall. I slept well at night and left with a smile because I felt my business was appreciated there. and when I come back next year, I already know where I'm staying."

It's just so darn hard to beat. I got close a couple times. The last time, I got knocked out on the bubble. I pushed all in with A/K, got called with A/J (nice call there, buddy) and the guy makes QUAD JACKS.

You can actually sit at Ms. Hooters International's table and have her deal to you. Reckon they gotta find some way to keep them busy in between photo shoots.\n\nThe staff is always very friendly, and the pool area is really cool.

            "review": "My wife and daughter stayed there for my daughters 21st b-day. \"EWE\" . 1st night were bitten by bed bugs (have pictures).During the next 2 days they were threatened at the pool by a \"known prostitute\" (according to the head of security) while soliciting guests in the spa.  After a lady from housekeeping came up and caught 2 bed bugs, they changed them to another (smaller) room? Also while in the elevator my wife actually had a conversation with another guest who also had bed bugs in their room. (GROSS!!) As for the incidents regarding the black prostitute at the pool area, security asked her to get out of the pool for swimming in bra and panties but did not escort her off the property??? (also stated to my wife and daughter that she was a known prostitute) I contacted the Director of Operations (Lisa Krasn) and also the general manager (Mark Sterbens) via email and phone calls in regards to this horrible stay in hopes they would handle this properly. Sadly all they did was say they were going to refund the $147 we paid for the 2 night stay. In my opinion as a guest, if this is how the \"shot callers\" handle these kind of incidents at their hotel, it doesn't make me feel safe for my family, or comfortable staying there. I'M OUT!!! There are so many places to stay in vegas where you are treated as a valued guest and treated like you matter. So if you want to get bitten by the bed bugs and have your kids see a real live prostitute in action...HOOTERS is the place to go."

We only got a 10 piece with the Daytona we know we like, but would've ordered more if we had that option! We had the buffalo dip too. The food was really good, no problems there, but just for the absolutely terrible awful service you get one star. It took forever for us to get greeted, we sat down and I went to the restroom & when I got back my fianc\u00e9 still hadn't been gotten to!! I don't think our waitress smiled once, and she only came to the table to take our order & give the check. She never checked to see if our food was ok, and we left cash because I figured if we had to wait for her to run a credit card we would've been there forever. I worked at hooters for 9 years and was trained to always pay extra attention to the women and couples to make them feel comfortable. She obviously only wanted to take care of her male customers. Hopefully they got better service!"

Check-in at the front desk was bad. The young lady was not kind at all. We requested the highest floor possible and she told us she only had the twelfth floor available and said everything else was occupied. We had some friends meeting us so I also asked if there were more rooms available on that floor close to each other. She said that they did have rooms available and all our friends needed to do was request the same floor. Upon entering our room there was a horrible stench and lots of nasty stains on the carpet that looked like dried up vomit. The lamp shades where all broken and the A/C was old school and made a lot of noise. When our friends arrived they were assisted by the same woman who assigned them the nineteenth floor after stating she no longer had available rooms on our floor. She lied to us about not having rooms available on a floor higher than the twelfth! Not that big of a deal, but nonetheless annoying. Besides that it took about an hour and about three phone calls to get our luggage up to our room! \n\nThe Hooter's restaurant had roaches climbing up the walls!No joke!Even the staff saw them and didn't do anything about it. This hotel/casino is pretty run-down. The only positive side to my stay was the pool area. There are three pools in the same area with a waterfall which were clean and comfortable to swim in. They also have a DJ who plays cool jams. I don't plan to stay here again and neither should you. Save yourself from the disappointment and waste of money.

If you are paying $20 for a hotel room in Vegas do not expect to get a 5 STAR, luxury \"Wynn\" experience. \n\nWhat we got for our $20 per night was the following:\n\n1 clean, very basic hotel room.\n20 free wings at the Hooters restaurant inside the hotel.\n2 free frozen drinks at the pool bar, plus one additional drink because it was \"ladies week\"\n2 free \"American\" breakfasts at The Mad Onion.\n\nIn addition to all the freebies, we received excellent customer service from everyone we interacted with at Hooters. All the hotel bars have $1.50 Bud/Bud Light if you are looking for cheap beer. Room Service will deliver Hooters wings to your room. The pool is open 24/7. There is a pretty decent fitness room/gym. If you are so inclined, there is a tattoo parlor in the hotel. The location is good...It is a very short walk to the Las Vegas Strip from the hotel.\n\nYes, the service at the Hooters restaurant inside the hotel is slow.\nYes, the parking garage and elevators are a little dingy.\nNo, it did not smell like poo, urine, sewage, raid, or anything else that people have complained about. \n\nTwo items of note:\nThere is an $8 resort fee per day.\nThere were many people on our floor who sat outside of their rooms, in the hallway, and smoked. So FYI, your room may be non-smoking but the hallway is not. \n\nIf you are just looking for a cheap, clean, no-frills place to crash, Hooters will serve the purpose. If you are looking for anything more than that, this is not the place for you. Move along...nothing to see here."

Even with all that, you have to admit that this hotel is getting pretty dated.\n\nOur group got a pool level bungalow.  An otherwise nice view of the pool which is partially obscured by the bars that are part of the security gate.  The inside of the rooms are pretty antiquated and in some cases run down. Our room had a CRT(old, Non-flatscreen for those technologically impaired) Television, rust/corrosion stains and chips in the sink and bathtubs, some of the hardware (faucets) loose and a couple crickets and roaches inside.  Luckily the air conditioning worked because it was a good 110+ degrees our entire stay. Also on the patio and even in some areas of the pool (waterfall area) there is a weird sewage stench noticeable in the air.  Not sure what that's all about. \n\nI didn't eat at the restaurant but a few of my friends did and while they enjoyed the wings, some of them didn't enjoy the other food options offered.  The little gift/snack shop also offers donuts, coffee and sandwiches.  The sandwiches for $6 could be a lot better though, very plain and basic and honestly not a great value. I found myself walking over to the local gas station to buy one of their sandwiches just to save myself about $3 for about the same quality (maybe slightly smaller). A bottle of water was also still $3 so the gas station was also the alternative for that.\n\nI didn't spend much time in the casino but it definitely felt \"old\".  They did have a sports style bar which was usually pretty empty but did have plenty of televisions.\n\nThe pool was actually the best part of this hotel and was probably the only thing other than the AC, that made this place acceptable. There are two main pools, one with a waterfall which runs a little cooler, another which runs a little warmer(and is more popular as a result) and some small Jacuzzi style pools. It's open 24 hours which is perfect for hot summer nights.  They have a DJ playing music, security and hostesses walking around and a bar right by. Plus if you have a bungalow you can go through the security gate (with key card unless it is left open) and get directly to the pool. They also held a beauty/swimsuit contest with the hooters girls by the restaurant area next to the pool which was great. All of this would have brought the review up to 3 stars except for on the last night (Saturday) after coming back from a long walk up and down the strip, we came back to find that the warmer pool had been closes and taped off.  Not sure why but I fear that some drunken frat kids maybe contaminated the pool \"somehow\" or perhaps it was something far more sinister.  Bummer.  The pool was considerably less busy as a result but nobody felt like going in the cooler pool that late.\n\nThe staff I encountered was actually pretty nice so that's one thing I can't really complain about. So kudos there.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that this is a cheaper hotel, so expect that.  If you don't spend a lot of time in a room in Vegas and you don't mind the location of this towards the end of the strip then I suppose it is for you.  It is nice that they have a pool which is [usually] open 24 hours.  The rooms are pretty run down, their televisions are antiquated and ours constantly lost signal and you might find a couple bugs here and there.  So if you are looking for \"nice\" rooms just pass.  Otherwise, on a budget, this place might suffice. I could see myself maybe staying here again if I was on a tight budget or something was extremely last minute."

And most importantly, the people at the pool were not pretentious or snooty at all. I met some really cool people there that just wanted to have fun.  That doesn't happen in Vegas very often, so we took advantage of the 24hrs!  2nd, the hotel room rates are cheap during the week. 4 nights for 83 dollars! When I booked it, I was so scared that it would be a run down hotel and would be dirty.  I was wrong. It was clean and the hotel room was bright and cheery. 3rd, 25 cents buffalo wings from 12-6am!  Could you ask for anymore? 4th, they played great music at the pool.\n\nI am not much of a gambler, in fact, I didn't gamble at all. But if you want a cool place to hang out, don't hesitate!"

Forgot something and had to go find a store because there was no way I was to be the ridiculous price for it at their shop downstairs. \n\n4: Somebody threw up by the elevator so I thought I would call them about it, yup, you would guess right if you would think it was still there in the morning.\n\n5: I would have preferred to sleep on the floor but was afraid I would catch something from the filthy carpets.  So I had to settle to sleeping on bed.\n\n6: The furniture looks like the same kind that's in my 12 yr old room.\n\nI spoke to several people who told me that this is somewhat of a shady place, wish I had known that before.

BUT there is a common \"customer service\" factor that should exist within every hotel be it a cheap or expensive one.   My friend and I were there for a 3-day music festival, so we were rarely in our hotel room, which gave housekeeping plenty of time every day to come into our rooms to tidy up. This only happened once and on the day before we were checking out.  The bell man who helped us to our room with all of our luggage was extremely smug and you could tell that he hated his life. Sorry dude... get a different job, don't bring me into your dislike for what you do, I didn't force you to work here.  We ordered room service a couple times.  One of the times an extremely snotty girl named Marian was more than awful to my friend and I, not only did she get the order wrong, but when we called to get it fixed she argued with us and told us that they took pictures of every order leaving the kitchen... if that was the case she would be able to see that it was wrong, but proceeded to argue before finally sending someone up with the 2 items that we needed to make it right.  Another time we were walking up to the host stand to get a menu to take to our room and the girls at the front kept saying how drunk they were and were giggling too much to pay attention to us standing in front of them.  \n\nOn the plus side, the A/C works really well, the blackout curtains are a gem, and the water pressure in the shower was really on point.   We did have an older bell man that helped us take our luggage TO our car when we were leaving and that man was super helpful and friendly.  He even helped us with directions on how to get out of Vegas from where we were. \n\nI'm not sure if I would ever stay there or really recommend  this hotel to any of my friends. I've definitely stayed at a lot better hotels, so maybe I'm a bit bias as to what to expect."

Look, if you don't love Hooters restaurants, then you probably won't like the casino either. But if you're already a Hooters regular, this place is fantastic. First, you can eat buffalo wings while your dealer shuffles. The blackjack tables are cheap. Plus you're surrounded by girls in low-cut orange running shorts. So 5-stars is a no brainer if you're a smoking, boozing, buffalo-wing eating. low-stakes gambler. I can't speak to the quality of the rooms. I've only eaten and gambled in the joint. I'm sure the rooms are nicer at the Mirage, but whatever. Bottom line: Hooters breads and fries their wings -- and each one packs about 200 calories of greasy chicken. And the girls are hot.

I received $200 free promo play, 2 free steak dinners including steaks/unlimited texas toast/fries or mashed or baked potato, $10 bonus slot play, $10 table matchplay, a free mug, and a free tote bag all along with a $19.95 room rate (also a $9.95 per night resort fee charge and $25 security hold per night).\n\nWhat made the deal even more spectacular were the rooms. Comfy beds, well-appointed, nice tropical decor with a cute faux plant, 2 complimentary waters every day, several outlets (often hard to find even in high end hotels I have gone to but they had outlets right on the desk top), wifi, brilliant bathroom, relatively clean and just plain comfortable. Was not a big fan of the woody-plank-looking things throughout the property but it could be tolerated with all the other niceties.\n\nWhat made the deal even better was the pool. It's a very nice pool at that rate. It has a pool bar (which I was not opportune to use in Dec weather), a nice hot spa jacuzzi, 3 pools (though they were too cold in Dec), a waterfall, tropical landscaping, a little sandy area, hot beds, fire beds, comfy day bed lounge chairs, a nice sitting/laying area in the pool....quite a bit of features for a 24/7 year-round pool (not sure any other hotel has their pools open at all hours)!\n\nWhat made the deal even sweeter was the casino. Yes, it's tiny but the slots were doing well for me, not super harsh. I had some fun at the craps table too. It's also nice to have $2.50 roulette (50 cent chips) and $3 BJ right under your nose. Also, I hit several small wins (like free wings and free shows and even a $50 bonus slot play) on the promo slots with my $200 free slot play but I kept playing through the wins trying to get a promo jackpot (of $1000 cash) reaching up to about $20,000 in free promo slot play...before losing it all. I got 3 hours on that slot...certainly wished the promo play counted for comps!\n\nWhat made the deal even more intriguing was the facilities. The gift shop has my favorite tollhouse cookie ice cream sandwich! The steakhouse (formerly known as Mad onion) has a wonderful and comfortable decor and open all night long. Food here was OK with me. Did not get a chance to go to Hooters but had the 25cent hooters wings at the bar and it was so nasty (tried them again in new Jersey and they still were gross). Taxis were always available outside. At least they have shows (which not all off-strip hotels do)! Internet kiosks abound. An arcade (though limited hours). And nearby trop and mgm are also nice, fun (more refined) casinos. I also like taking the 201 bus from in front of the hotel down to Tropicana Cinemas on trop ave for $1.50 second-run movies. \n\nGranted, the bright oranges and wood plank thingies everywhere can be a tad overboard. And people might find Hooters *not* as grandiose and impressive as other Strip casinos but it's fully comfortable and decent. All in all, however, Hooters is a hotel and casino with a very nice and fun vibe with great value especially with a good offer."

Oh I do have one. Ok good.  I'm given my keys and I go to my room. Disappointed is an understatement.  Look I realize this might not be a 5 star resort but I at least want a clean hotel room. Upon entering the room with the many stains on the floor and the general lack of vacuuming I find hair on the vanity, in the bathroom sink and counter and clearly the base of the toilet hadn't been cleaned and there was hair on that as well. Then don't even get me started on the bathtub and then the bathroom floor which has clearly not been cleaned. I'm tired so I think I'm going to bed. I get into bed and there is again more unknown hair. Lets just say I'm grossed out. After 3-4 hours of tossing and turning and just feeling itchy all over we get up and go downstairs to the help desk.  We ask for the bedding to be changed and the room cleaned. We were told no problem we will handle it. We left and came back only to find nothing had been done. So we call the front desk again and they say we can't go in the room when no one is there which is lame because they do that when they clean your room. So mind you this is now 405am. They say give us 15 minutes and we will fix it. 25 minutes later go by and we call again. They seem surprised no one has come up and say we will send someone right away. They come up to replace our bedding and give us the sheets. So at almost 5 in the morning we get to make our own bed. Wow. Apparently I work for them now. Long story short. We changed rooms the next day to a little bit better room but still with flaws and they waive our resort fee.  They tried to make it right but overall a bad experience and one for the books."

Rooms kind of suck but the on site tat shop did a great job on my buddy. \nThis place gets 5 stars because of their bartender Pam. She's older and in the back bar usually. This chic rocks!\nFood is standard for hooters. \nI got the presidential suite there a few years ago.

However, in this case, my experience was a big fat disappointment.  It is partially my fault, because I failed to read the disclaimers.  You see, about 12 months ago, Priceline changed their hotel \"zones\" from \"North Strip\" to \"North Strip & Vicinity\" and from \"South Strip\" to \"South Strip & Vicinity.\"  Oh boy.\n\nThe last two times I was in Vegas (Final Four Weekend and Kentucky Derby Weekend), I was unfortunate enough to have been relegated to the \"vicinity.\"  I am talking about Hooters Hotel and Casino, formerly known as San Remo Hotel.  The Hootel, as I like to call it, is located just behind Tropicana and just across the street from MGM Grand.  The location is really not that bad.  Besides, I only paid $69/night, which my friends found to be hilarious in itself.\n\nHowever, was it a good value?  NO!!!!\n\nThe Hootel is worse than you can imagine.  Only one of the two elevators in our tower worked.  The Hootel seemed to have a shortage of hand towels and regular sized towels.  When we called housekeeping, they promptly brought us more bath towels.  Hmmm.  The towels weren't even all that white.  Hmmm again.  The latch on my balcony door wasn't working.  Hmmm one more time.  The walls are paper thin, so you can hear a lot of what's going on in the adjacent rooms.  Hmmm and shrug.  We stayed on a non-smoking floor, but the \"no smoking\" designation must have included tobacco only, because the distinct smell of marijuana emanated from the hallway (I am talking to you, obnoxious guests in Room 1008).  Hmmm and sniff-sniff.\n\nThe room itself is a sight to see.  It's not your average Zach and Cody's suite at the Tipton Hotel.  It's more like Hannah Montana's after-school Malibu hangout . . .  if she and her friends wore orange shorts and served you beer and chicken wings.  (OK, even I don't know where this analogy came from).\n\nHave you ever dreamed of having your own Hooters Restaurant in your house, without the women or chicken wings?  Well, your fantasy is realized right here, in your very own Hooters hotel room.  Your room decor will feature tables and backboards made of unfinished wood, bright orange lampshades, a painting of a Hooters restaurant on the wall, a fake palm tree, and ... an orange bar stool and a bar table right in your room!!!  Score!\n\nUnfortunately, no amount of orange decorations could make up for the white trash appeal of this hotel.  The clientele of this Hootel is unbelievably white trash.  Never in my life have I seen so many Harley Davidson and Lynyrd Skynyrd t-shirts on a casino floor.  Every group of frat boys checking in had a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon or Bud in tow.  Women had questionable tattoos and wore Daisy Duke shorts.  Casino featured neon lights and an original Alan Kulwicki's NASCAR vehicle.  I kept hearing Jeff Foxworthy's \"You might be a redneck if . . . \" routine in my head.  'Nuff said.\n\nI love a good bargain, but this isn't it.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $10-30 a night on a real hotel room.  I am never staying here again, EVER."

However in this economy customer service is essential for a business to thrive.  The valet attendant who simply drove our vehicle and left the car without saying anything to us and didn't offer to assist with luggage made the choice of tip amount simple.  Zero.  Because he didn't even say a word to us as he walked by, presumably to take his smoke break.  \n\nThe pool is open 24/7 all year round, however it's all guys there, and I'd hate to even think of the sperm count contained within.  The only women at that pool are the hooters girls, and they're paid to flirt with you.  You're not that funny.  In fact, watching you from my window I saw most of the waitresses avoiding you after hassling them for your fifth picture and yelling, \"sluts!\"\n\nThe next door neighbors violently vomiting (with the door open?) until 5 am is to be expected in Vegas at a \"red neck haven\" such as this one.  If you can afford to go somewhere else, do so.  Otherwise, stay home, save your money and buy a pair of shoes.\n\nThat said, the servers were nice.  You have to be respectful to them and you may get the same waitress back to the table more than once.  If you're a d-bag or harassing, it seems they'll send a different one to take over."

Since their company is very cheap, they have a very small expense allowance. And since their company definitely has a macho-like personality, sort of a frat brothers, locker room personna, they chose Hooters!\n\nI said \"Are you kidding me?\" I suggested going to Chinatown and getting some good, inexpensive food, like Thai, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, and I had a car to take them all out there. But since it was 3 of them versus just me, it was Hooters.\n\nHooters Hotel and Casino is exactly like their restaurants. Girls in white Tees and little orange gym shorts. You would think that here in Vegas, this would be their flagship location and they would upscale it in decor, amenities, and staffing. \n\nNope. \n\nEven though it is a hotel and Casino, it has the same look and feel of their restaurants. What do they call themselves? Tacky? They got that right.\n\nPlus, Hooters has awful food. Deep fried, tasteless, unimaginative. It's food you might find in Talledega at the NASCAR races in the picnic coolers of the baseball cap wearing HVAC and Cable repair men. Only warmed up a bit. \n\nIn Vegas, with all the beautiful women working here in the various service venues of shows, casinos, gentelmen's clubs, etc., Hooters has got to be the bottom of the barrel. The \"talent\" here is just above 7 Eleven, just wearing less. That makes the food that much more indigestible."

From the Pit Bosses, to the waitresses, the desk staff, and housekeeping, everyone was delightful and really wanted to make our stay special! It is obvious that the management team knows about service and is making sure that everyone is focused on doing the right thing for everyone.  The casino is a little small, but it gives you an almost family feel which was completely unexpected. I strongly recommend this hotel and casino and will definitely be going back!"

            "review": "My waitress was very efficient. She was pretty busy but she too good care of us! I ordered the Cheesy Totts, they were ok. They were a little skimp on the bacon and sour cream, and although it was ok, I dont think i'd order that again. My friend ordered the Caesar salad which in our opinion had too much dressing. She ordered that to be healthy and we all know there are lots of calories in dressing. We also ordered the caramel fudge cheesecake. Its was ok, the fudge on the bottom of the cheesecake was a little overwhwhelming for me. The chocolate syrup swirled on the the plate would've been enough chocolate for me. But otherwise it was good. So I give this Hooters 3 stars because it was all around OK. Nothing, not the food or the service was great. In addition it was about a 35 minute wait, there were a lot of empty tables, im thinking they were short staffed and should hire more people so they can accomodate more people so the wait is in turn shorter, just a thought."

Not to mention we were accompanied by our favorite hooter-lovin' lesbian friends.\n\nDid you know I love boneless buffalo chicken tenders/wings?  Well I do, and one day I will have a list for them.  Boobies has them and some of the best.  \n\nP.S. Make sure you get wings and tenders with MEDIUM sauce... mild is nothing but butter sauce.  Lame.\n\nMy only complaint was that we got seated near the live music and it was ridiculously loud, not to mention they charge you an \"entertainment tax\" for sitting in the music area.  Unless that interests you I'd ask to just be seating in the general area.\n\nMy only other complain is the $25 picture they try selling you.  It was a cute picture, especially with the extra 10 Boobies-girls photoshopped into the picture.  I wish they didn't charge so much so I'd want to buy it!\n\nI'm tempted to go with 4 stars on this one but I'm gay.  End of story."

            "review": "I've never been to Hooters the restaurant nor am I the Hooter-type, but my bf and I stayed here for a weekend because we were trying to find the most bang for our buck and we definitely found it here.\n\nGood:\n-Two nights for $100\n-We had a bungalow room reserved but they gave us tower room without us even asking \n-Clean rooms, nothing fancy but also nothing gross to complain about. Although, the walls are kind of thin, we woke up to some girl yelling at her bf the next room over. Kind of amusing but not at 3 in the morning. \n-Small hotel which means less walking to and from the garage and our room, woohoo!\n-Not smoky! I hate walking through the big casinos and having my eyes sting afterwards because of all the smoke. This can possibly mean no one likes to gamble at Hooters but hey it worked out for me!\n-Close to airport and freeway (we had a car). Probably not the most convenient place to stay if you don't have a car since it's at the end of the strip unless you love to walk.\n\nBad:\n-Elevators to garage are old and in desperate need of repair, be sure to hold on\n-Late check in. We came around 11AM and they told us we could check in at 4PM. Luckily we called back and they were able to get us a room earlier.\n\nThat's about all the bad stuff i could think of. It really wasn't a bad place to stay except for brief moment of embarrassment you might have to endure when people ask you where you're staying. And possibly also when you want to tell people what a good experience you had for the price paid but don't want to further embarrass yourself."

            "review": "If you want deal with a staff who is super hospitable and accommodating but want a room that smells of sweat, weed, and sadness then this is perfect. Our room was \"non-smoking\" but someone made a filter out of a plastic bag and put it over the smoke detector so they could hot box it. I loved the view outside the hotel but at night the holes in the curtains from critters let the Vegas strip bright lights through to make your room a customized planetarium. Our tub was brown and it would clog every time you would shower. The room decor looked like they found a LOWES going out of business and took all the 2x4 boards and lined the ceiling and made outdated headboards which are great for slamming hookers against. Our safe didn't work but got fixed. I also while taking a nap found a piece of glass in my sheets. I'm praying it's a broken piece of a cocktail glass and not a crack pipe. The water filter behind the ice machine looked like it was last changed when the Dallas Cowboys won a super bowl. The carpets smelled like sweat and were moldy. The restaurant was the best part. Food was hooters food and was done well for what they do. The bar staff was really nice. Overall the hotel was super sketch. If you want to go for an experience and a good story then it's a 10/10. Otherwise pick somewhere else. It always could be worse. I want to reiterate the staff was awesome and a pleasure to deal with."
