            "review": "I took my husband there for our anniversary and was looking forward to experiencing a very special night out. Starting with our table: It was supposed to be at a window with sight of the Canale Grande, but all we saw was the wall. My husband was excited thinking he'll get a magnificent Osso Bucco. Yet all he got was a tasteless piece of meat with a big bone in the middle. I had Lasagne and ask for an extra Bechamel sauce. Nobody came back and after I asked again, some guy\nput a gravy dish on the table - with Tomato sauce in it. Great job, Mr. 108 Team 8!\nAnd, by the way, nobody asked us ever how the meals were. Then I was charged 8 bucks for a bottle of probably tap water that I never asked for. So I complained right there about the whole situation and wrote a critic on the back of the bill. The manager must have seen it and gave us a new bill without charging for the water. Of course, the whole critic was gone too. And yes, they gave us a free dessert which was no consolation after all the fuss we encountered.\nThat does not mean that we will never come back to the Venetian. There are plenty of other nice restaurants. But maybe not Zefferinos."

            "review": "Tip:  They have a Price Fix menu and specials, but do not give you either menu.  Ask for it.  \n\nAfter a few days of usual Vegas eateries and the card flippers outside (seriously... does that actually work?), we decided to have a nice quiet sit Italian dinner on our last night.  A friend picked this spot after walking around a bit.\n\nAt first glance, this is really a beautiful spot.  Great decor, nice views overlooking the grand canal, and a great spot overall.  That is where being impressed stopped though.\n\nVegas was still pretty busy, being this was the Monday after Super Bowl.  We had reservations, and had to wait for about 5 minutes before our table was ready.  Walking in though, there were barely any tables taken.  That made me scratch my head a bit, and I hate when they do that.\n\nTo the important part here... the food.  First off, they messed up my first Martini and put blue cheese olives in it (Blue Cheese is my kryptonite).  The next one they brought had ice chips (huge pet peeve).  Whatever... on to dinner.  The waiter recommended large apps for our large group (looking around at our massive table of 6 I was quite confused).  Whatever... if the others wanted it fine.  Calamari, cold cuts and mozz, etc.  They were good.  They better be... I didn't even want to look at what they charged for it all.  The $11 Caesar salad was pitiful.  For that price you sure as hell better be making it fresh tableside.  Obviously, it was not.  \n\nAs mentioned before, there is the Price Fix menu and a specials menu.  We definitely got some attitude when asking for it though.  It was becoming very clear why this place was not busy.  The economy still is not great, and this place is no deal.  For the main entrees, everything was good.  Maybe I just judge all Italian food by what I get in NYC... but this was really nothing special (especially considering the prices).  I had some ravioli, which for $29 the 12 small ravioli just were not worth it.  By the way, we did not order off the special menus obviously.\n\nBy this point I was done.  Again, nothing really offensive here but the prices.  A friend did order the tiramisu as he \"had to have it\", and afterwards regretted it (especially for the price), as it was some custard in a martini glass.  Very odd.  I think everyone enjoyed the meal though, but hell, I was the one paying for it.\n\nMy advice would be to save some money and try elsewhere.  The place is beautiful, and at  1/2 the price I would rate this as 4 stars easy.  But walking out around $100 per person with tax and tip just was not worth the money.  And one more thing that made me laugh... in the men's bathroom they had the attendant who was not there (but the bowl of tips was out).  What made me laugh more though was the cologne selection... a couple I never heard of, and then and Axe body spray.  REALLY people?  Axe body spray?"

            "review": "This place is a hidden gem in Vegas!  We came here on a Friday night and were seriously surpised that the place was almost empty.  We were seated on the upper level next to the balcony, overlooking the canal (highly recommend sitting here).  What an awesome view!  It's beautiful to look at plus you get to watch the gondolas go by serenading their guests.  Not only does this place feel like you are dining in an authentic Italian restaurant in Venice, but the food is as authentic as it gets.  Homemade, fresh Italian pasta!  Both our pastas were as great as the pastas we had in Italy.  The decor is awesome.  Even the plates make you feel like you're in Italy.  If you're looking for a nice restaurant, with great ambiance, and great Italian food, then come here.  If you're looking for a Vegas feel party restaurant, this is not the place for you."

            "review": "I wanted to try a high end brunch while in Vegas so it was between the Sterling Brunch and Zeffirino.  I chose Zeffirino because I was staying at the Palazzo and it was slightly cheaper then the Sterling Brunch.  The restaurant is in the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian.  The room itself is upstairs overlooking the Canal.  It has the feel of an Italian villa.\n\nLike the Sterling Brunch, Zeffirino offers unlimited champagne.  I don't remember the brand but I frankly didn't care.  This brunch doesn't offer your typical breakfast fare but what they did offer was fine food with a decidedly Italian flair.  Offerings included a bunch of different cured meats, pastas, and all different  types of salads.  However the real reason I was there was for the unlimited lobster.  They were chilled whole lobsters split in half.  They weren't warm but they were still extremely tasty.  Other offerings included freshly shucked oysters and clams, P&D shrimp cocktail and lobster claws.  Other excellent offerings included Chateaubriand and lamb chops.  The sea bass was delicious as well as all the pasta offerings.  They do offer omelets made to order.  The accompaniments for the omelets are somewhat slim but what they did have was absolutely done right.  I ordered and spinach and onion omelet and it was fluffy and flavorful.  Desserts were ok.  Offerings seemed somewhat limited but in all honesty by the time I got to dessert, I could barely move I was so full.\n\nService was excellent from start to finish.  The wait staff made sure that your champagne glass was always filled to your desire as well as offering bloody marys.  Plates were cleared in a timely fashion and the wait staff was always there to fill your needs including taking oyster orders and omelet orders.  However they were not overbearing.  I was reading the Sunday NY Times and spent over 2 hours there but never felt rushed to leave.  Granted they weren't packed but they were very accommodating.\n\nOverall an excellent experience.  Not for those looking for typical breakfast fare at brunch but it is for people who want a unique dining experience."

            "review": "This restaurant is one of the few (if not the only one) with a great view of the Venetian hotel's canal where you can watch gondolas pass by.  It has a romantic European ambiance as well.  The Italian food was good too, but it's a bit expensive averaging about $20-30 per person without alcohol.  Also, the service was below average.  It was fine in the first ten minutes, but after we received our food, our waiter and the staff were not very friendly and never came back to check in on us or give us free soda refills.  Maybe if you have a large bill, they'd be more attentive.  Too bad. I would have given it four stars just for the ambiance and food; unfortunately, it loses out on value and service."

            "review": "Excellent food, with horrific service. Came here with a couple friends and my boyfriend for lunch one Sat. Like a previous review stated, the hostess was very gracious and kind, but that's where it stops. Our service was very shotty. Our server seemed to have absolutely no interest on giving us good service since we weren't dropping hundreds on lunch buying bottle waters or drinking wine or alcohol. Ordered and Iced tea and not once did anybody offer a refill for my tea. I shouldn't have to wave you down to refill my ice tea. 2 of my friends wanted to share an appetizer and an entree and was straight up told by our server that it wasn't allowed. Our server was very rude. He only came to our table to take our order and drop off our check. This place seemed so promising but due to the service of one server, this place came off very pretentious. Maybe if the staff/server spent less time on their iPhones and more time taking care of their guests,  I could give this place another try next time I was in Vegas. But I can assure u I will NEVER go or suggest this place ever again. U shouldn't leave feeling like u were looked down upon when you was choose to spend my hard earned money on the establishment."

            "review": "For a $400 dinner for four, I expect service to be pretty remarkable. Yet service at this overrated, on-the-canal-in-the-Venetian restaurant was so inattentive it was nonexistent. \n\nOur starters arrived before our cocktails. \nOur wine arrived halfway through our dinners (I believe he forgot it.)\nOur check didn't arrive until we flagged down our waiter.\n\nThe food? All right. I live in Chicago - a city with hundreds of palate-pleasing eateries - and I've had better Italian down the road from my apartment. The standout was the caprese salad - the mozzarella had an almost air-like mouthfeel. Very nice. Other than that - overpriced seafood (shrimp and lobster) that bordered on chewy and bland. \n\nMany people rave about Zeffirino's lunch prix fixe menu - if that's where the value and experience lay, then so be it. But for dinner - I wouldn't take anyone back here. I've had better service at a Denny's."

That made me a bit skpetical but we heard good things and thought we should check it out.  WOW!  What a great dining experience from the food to the service to the view overlooking the canal and gondolas below.  We all had a different meal and everyone loved their dinner.  The wine list is extensive and the service was top notch.  The other interesting thing is that Zeffirino has probably one of the nicest, cleanest and most well-equipped bathrooms I have ever seen in a restaurant!  Seems weird to note this but they actually received an award for it.  I highly recommend Zeffirino for a lovely dining experience next time you are in Las Vegas!"

The dough at Five 50 in the Aria tasted much better and you can actually taste the dough.  i confronted the manager but she said she did not know what Yelp is and she stated that the fresh dough was made downstairs meaning not on the premises. if this was authentic italian then why the dough for the pizza is not made from scratch. i rather eat in a fast food rather then waste my time or money on this place. avoid it."

I appreciated the attention when it was needed from our server and the respect for our privacy when we wished to enjoy the romantic view to ourselves and delight in our courses without bother. Our waiter was a mature gentlemen who understood timing and service perfectly. He was a delightful host and made us feel welcomed and at ease. I never once felt interrupted by the service and that is really hard to come by. It was quintessentially italian because of the relaxed and slow environment. Dinner was quite extravagant. The sauces cooked to perfection. And being in the company of my love made it even more magical and dreamy. It was wildly romantic and kind of divine but that may have all been owed less to the restaurant and more to the fact that I was deeply lovestruck.  P.S. Their restrooms are particularly quaint and riddled with character but in tactful and slightly humorous manner."

After my trip to Italy, I know what real Italian food tastes like so I hope I am a good judge of Italian food.  Yes it is pricey, so I would reserve this place for your significant other.\n\nThe food here is very authentic.  For an appetizer, I recommend the sliced italian cold cuts with black olives, cheese and bell peppers and Prosciutto di San Daniele con Melone ($20).  I have also had the Seitan carpaccio with shaved parmigiano, rucola sprouts, extra virgin olive oil Gamberi (shrimp) al Vapore ($16) and the Ostriche (oysters,. $14.95 for a 1/2 dozen and $24.95 for a dozen.  For larger parties, I recommend the mixed seafood platter: 10 oysters, 4 clams, 6 shrimp, 1 1/2 lb. lobster, 4 king crab legs ($90).\n\nEntrees:   I have had the baccala, Pan seared black cod with extra virgin olive oil, dried porcini mushrooms, garlic, parsley, anchovies, white wine and lemon juice Zuppa d'Astice, Riso Nero, Pomodoro e Curcuma ($30), the spigola, Grilled whole mediterranean sea bass served with garlic, extra virgin olive oil, oregano, lemon juice and parsley sauce (very simple, $38), one of the specialties of the house, a 1 1/2 lb. lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams and scallops served over linguine in a spicy tomato sauce and fettuccine sauteed with crabmeat, half of a 1 1/2 lb. lobster, and shrimp with a touch of tomato sauce (I have had it both ways ($42).\n\nTo finish, I ususally have the insalata mista or the insalata alternativa.  A nice way to finish the meal.  I am not much a dessert person so I won't rate the desserts.  But the waiter is good about recommending a grappa to finish an excellent meal.\n\nI would rate the food 5 stars but the service 3-4 stars.  Everytime I go we have to ask for things, i.e., olive oil, water, et al..  At a restaurant like this where you are paying $100/head before wine, the wait staff should anticipate or ask for your needs.\n\nI would have taken pictures but there is a big sign requesting that no pictures be taken.

With every bartender, they were great!  Very friendly and happy to mix up whatever we wanted."

Hard to do in that part of the strip. They seated us immediately and were very helpful with the menu.  Everyone loved their meals.  But I wish I would have taken a picture of mine. I decided to order something out of the ordinary cuz ya know - it's an Italian restaurant so they had all the typical Italian fare. I got the whole wheat tofu stuffed ravioli with asparagus sauce. It was amazing! The sauce wasn't a heavy cream-based but a light puree.  OMG it was yummy. Should have taken a picture!"

We visited several restaurants with either famous chefs or great reviews, and for some reason (cannot remember who recommended it) we also went to Zeffirino one night for dinner.\n\nI arrived slightly early than everyone else and was ignored by the maitre'd as I stood in front of her, instead she walked to a small group of people eyeing the restaurant as they walk through the grand canal shops and started talking to them.  Eventually (after maybe 10-15 mins) I decided to enter on my own and sat down at the bar for a drink.  The maitre'd did not become more effective after my friend arrived and our group of 7 (or 8, i can't remember) was sat at a 5 men booth while there being only two other occupied table in the whole restaurant.  We mentioned the seat being \"too cozy\" and was not acknowledged.\n\nAfter most of our drinks were served it took another 8 requests for my friend's \"hot water\" to reach the table for her tea bag.  Meanwhile, we realized that the menu was rather limited with plain pasta+marinara sauce being around $20.  The disaster is just about to begin...  as a group, we ordered 6 appetizers, 3 salads, and 6 entrees to share, but it was obvious that the staff at the restaurant felt that we were cheap for not ordering enough and their attitude was absolutely horrible.  First it was the over-cooked duck that the manager insist is done medium rare,\n\nManager,  \"We DO NOT, and WILL NOT EVER serve duck cooked more than medium rare.\"\nUs, \"So how would you call this? (showing him the meat)\"\nManager, \"That is definitely more than well-done!\"\nUs, \"and we asked for MEDIUM RARE\"\nManager, \"But We DO NOT, and WILL NOT EVER serve duck cooked more than medium rare\"\nUs, \"Er...............\"\n\nAside from the tea/hot-water problem, and the duck-problem, we seem unable to get the wait staff to provide us with the correct number of utensils throughout the whole meal.  Although they were not busy at all, with only two other tables being occupied in the restaurant, they had extreme difficulties being us 7 but not 4 forks and 7 but not 5 knifes.  The service was simply offensive.\n\nAll in all, it was a horrible experience, not a single dish was memorable.  The steak was average, all the pastas were at diner level (even Olive Garden makes better stuff), the salads were nothing more than what you can get at a college dinning hall and the appetizers were so not interesting I can't recall a single thing about them.\n\nDon't go!!!!!"

            "review": "One of the best parts of the Zeffirino experience is opening up their dessert menu and seeing a picture of Nicolas Cage looking back at you. Since it is well documented that Cage excels in being \"awesome\" personified, his presence in the menu for this place confirms that you are in for a treat. And for the most part, you are! Cage would not steer you wrong! Nor would I! Nor would any of the staff here, provided they come around to your table on a more frequent basis.\n\nLas Vegas is not lacking in dining options. Shoot, The Venetian itself probably has somewhere around 73,000 restaurants inside of it alone, making your choice of eatery even more daunting. But Zeffirino deserves your attention for sheer ambience, deliciousness and overall experience. And the whole package starts before you even get inside the door. Well, actually, wait - you probably end up seeing this place before you can get to it: it stretches several storefronts on the second floor, so you'll see blue awnings adorned with the name of the place over shops while diners sit above and look out the windows at the gondolas going by and the desperate tourists trying to convince themselves this is actually Venice, a feat no amount of alcohol or goofy bachelorette photos will achieve. The door leading in is around the corner.\n\nNow then... when you arrive, a duo of hostesses greet you with a level of personality and poise that is great to behold. These ladies either really care about each guest coming through the doors, or are great actresses. Me? I chose to think they liked seeing us, but then again, I live in denial regularly. Anyway, our hostess walked us up a flight of stairs past an opulent bar and lounge area, through another smaller lounge and into an elongated dining room that went around the corner to the windows where the other guests probably vie for seating. We had a party of five and settled in for a booth, and this was one of the nicest booths I've had the pleasure of sitting in. For one thing, the booth backs go up past your head, considerably. It lends a degree of privacy. For another, they're comfy!\n\nWe were waiting for the remaining guests in our party to arrive when a waiter showed up to take our drink order and fill us in on the specials. We ordered and settled on a bottle of wine per his recommendation - and he made a great choice, one of which escapes me completely as I type this. Our last guests showed up and the wine was poured, the entrees were ordered and an appetizer platter was prepared. The platter itself was decadent: prosciutto, melon, mozzarella, etc. Each piece was delectable, and ditto the calamari, too. The appetizer price, $78, was not so delectable. Pricing can be a bit egregious here, so be warned.\n\nAnd then the entrees arrived. Simply put, this is masterclass dining. Everything from the pounded chicken to the risotto and my personal entree, some seafood pasta that made me consider masquerading as Aquaman interviewing for a position as a chef with this place, were outstanding. Food of this scale is known for landing people in comas but at least we were flirting with a comatose status with a smile on our faces. After all, desserts had to still be ordered! And that was how Nicolas Cage reaffirmed that everything was going to be okay with the world.\n\nAnd for the most part, everything here is okay. We were seated in a great dining room, the food was outstanding and a violinist even stopped by at one point for entertainment. But just as he put in an appearance and moved on with his duties, so, too, did the majority of the waitstaff. Service here, as other reviewers have mentioned, drags... And drags some more... And maybe that's their way of not rushing you and letting you enjoy the full Zeffirino experience. That's fine, but I would like to do it with my after dinner scotch. I'm not sure how long it takes to grab a scotch from the bar but apparently it is an epic quest bordering on the Homeric side of things. And then when it arrived, it was skimpy, at best. If that's what ordering it \"neat\" gets you, you might want to save your booze budget for somewhere else. You're certainly not lacking in options.\n\nBut to lose sight over the greatness in the face of service sidesteps is missing the point. This is a wonderful choice to host a private event or try to impress a date at. You've got delicious food, an ambience practically lifted off the streets of Italy and the world's friendliest bathroom attendant! At least, I think that's what he was. I'm not sure... There was a guy I'm assuming employed here standing in the hallway on the way to the bathroom who was quick to open the door to the room and stand by outside. I mention this because, well, why not? If he can be more prompt in his service than some of the other members of the staff, good for him. Hats off to the kitchen, the hostesses and the bathroom attendant!"

It hit on all cylinders - Service, quality, atmosphere, unique, wine list, etc. (see photo's on my profile)\n\nIt was just the 2 of us and we ran across this place while wandering around the canal shops at the Venetian around noon. We asked to take a look inside prior to making a dinner reservation and fell in love with the atmosphere upstairs. We made a reservation and requested a table overlooking the canal but they could not guarantee it. We came back at 6. \n\nWe checked in and made our way upstairs. The anticipation for a canal side table was giving me butterflies as they led us to our table......TA DA sitting on the railing upstairs overlooking the canal. \n\nNow the important part - Time to deliver. Our waiter was Ben (assisted by 3 others) he helped pick out a nice wine (my requirements were Italian Red, bold, unique and under $100) He consulted with 2 others and they came back with a very nice Sangiovanese(?) reserve for $75. It was deelish! \nWe went with the calamari appetizer - very good. \n\nDid I mention we were overlooking the canal. It was soooo romantic. We have been married 23 years and both loved the setting, the sounds of the singers drifting up, the view.......Very special. \n\nThe service was attentive and prompt. Our waiter asked us our likes and dislikes and made suggestions and we went with it. \n\nMy wife had the Sea Bass and I had a seafood pasta dish. The presentation of each meal was great. The sea bass arrived on a plate with half a lobster (in shell) tucked behind it. We did not know this when ordering and thought they brought out the wrong dish but there was the sea bass sitting in front under a topping of thinly sliced leeks. My dish was a split lobster (in shell) with a pile of linguine noodles in the middle, topped with scallop, shrimp,clams, mussels and other goodies. (see photos on my profile). \n\nNo dessert, too full. \n\nEverything was great. I sum it up this way - Would I go back? YES! \n\nThe good - Atmosphere, service, wine, food, selection, overall experience. \nThe bad - only 1 scallop on my dish, prices a touch high but worth it."

The sauce was basic marinara.  This can be a hit with the 12 year old's who are plain eaters.  The Salmon looked large, 12 ounces, I was jealous that I did not order it. They had a weird spinach muffin type cups that were a little odd, but tasted fine. \nThey basically handle big parties and they are all about the speed and convenience of banquet parties.   \n\nThe banquet lady on the phone told me that she has house wine for about 40$.  So when the wine guy approached me.  I told him to give us the house wine.  He had a bit of confusion. You you need to pick your wine, they sent over the wine director (Thanks, Gary the wine guy ) I felt bad because I just picked the cheapest. I was not paying for the party but I had to kind of handle all of the plans. \n\nThe red was some Italian grape I forget, it was OK. I'm a white drinker, so the Pinot Grigio was way better . The bottles ran about 32$ to 37$. \n\nWe arrived late and we were waiting in the bar for the rest of our group.  My sister-in-law called and asked me to order a kid pasta for her three-year-old.  So I went to the hostess at the downstairs front door and she told me that we could order from the bartender.  The bartender told us that we had to order from our waiter upstairs.  \nI went upstairs to tell the hostess that we needed a kid pasta ordered and we will have a screaming toddler arriving shortly.  She tells me we have been wondering where you were, your the first to check in, WHAT.  We checked in downstairs, a half hour ago?.  I don't understand the point of the hostess downstairs?    Lost one star for the teenage hostess that basically stands there and stares at you when you asks her questions like, \"DO you have a kids Menu\", and.... \"Do I tell my family to follow the Canal Shoppes signs from the Valet or what are some of the signs they should follow\"? I get no response. I had to find my own menu inside the door.  She just stared at me with, a look like why are you asking me for menu's and directions?\n\nJust play it safe and valet your car in front of Venetian and go straight to the concierge on your right and they will give you a map with about fifteen turns and you still get a little lost.  Eventually you will get there.  \n\nWhen my sister-in-law showed up, she saw a big party of 65 people walk in front of us. Also, because of the impending screams of a hungry three year old, she was ready to leave. We talked her into getting upstairs to the table, and 3 seconds later there was pasta in front of the hungry toddler. \nI don't think she realized that when you contract for a large party, you have to commit to a certain number of people and her dinner would have been charged. \n\nThe service was impeccable, the food was warm and Delicious, the entertainment was so fun and the decor was absolutely beautiful.\n\nThe violinist guys hung out with us for a long time, I realized that our \"Best man\", was throwing down some cash.  They also had a couple guitarist a Roy Orbison looking guy, they were so cute.\n\nThe toddler had a fit and grandma took him to the bathroom.  Big couch in there, you have to see the water closet's. \nThe servers brought the baby some ice cream into the bathroom. How sweet is that!!!\n\nZeffirino's caters to big parties, we got a little scared thinking we better hurry and order before that big party gets ahead of us.

I had the \"Grand Canal\" menu which was about $25\n-When we sat down, the server took about 3 minutes to come over to the table and upon seeing the free meal coupons, he did not greet us and just said \"oh, you have those\" like he was annoyed to have us at his table\n-The water that was brought to the table was warm and had no ice\n-We asked for ice, had to ask a second server to bring us the ice after our server didn't, and when the ice was brought out he just brought us a bucket and set it on the table without saying anything.  \n-My dad doesn't drink coffee or tea and asked if he could have a diet soda instead, and the server said \"no, you only get what's on the card\" in a very stiff and annoyed manner....like it would be that difficult to just give him a soft drink instead of coffee or tea.  \n-My mom had a salad and the grilled salmon, my dad had a salad and the chicken marsala, and I had the calamari appetizer, pan seared salmon filet, and the \"dessert\" of \"various pastries\"\n-The calamari was rubbery and tasted like it was previously frozen, the quality was on par with something I would get from the grocery store frozen section\n-The salads my parents had were bland and tasteless\n-The chicken marsala my dad ordered was terrible.  When I say terrible, I mean it was absolutely horrendous, almost inedible. Chicken was rubbery and overcooked, tasted like it was previously frozen and microwaved, definitely not \"pan seared\" as it was supposed to be, the marsala sauce tasted like canned gravy, and we both agreed that it was the worst chicken marsala we've ever tasted, and chicken marsala is my dad's favorite dish.\n-The salmon I had was caked in breading, had no indication of being pan-seared (no sear marks anywhere), also tasted like it was previously frozen, and there was no garlic, white wine, onions, parsley, or black olives as the menu indicated\n-The potatoes were dry and had no seasoning\n-The server never came back to the table to ask us how anything was before we finished eating it\n-When the \"dessert\" that came with the Grand Canal menu came out, it was three tiny bite-sized pastries and all of them were soggy and soft to the touch, like they had been left in a refrigerator overnight (or longer) and the moisture made them mushy.  They were obviously not freshly made.\n-When the server finally came back to the table and asked us how the food was, I told him that honestly everything was absolutely terrible, gave him the reasons why, and he said something to the effect of \"oh, sorry to hear that\".  He walked away, did not offer to bring us anything else, and never told a manager about our complaint.  \n-The server did not bring our coffee or tea, he just dropped the check on the table and never bothered to ask if we wanted to order anything else\n-After we asked him for the coffee and tea, we had to remind him a second time before it was brought out\n-The tea was a Lipton tea bag with hot water.  A fine-dining restaurant should not be giving customers a Lipton tea bag that I can get 100 bags of at the grocery store for $3.\n-On the way out of the restaurant, the server was walking towards me and immediately walked the other way, not wanting to say anything to us on the way out\n\nSince this was my parents' 30th anniversary vacation, I did not want to make a big deal out of the experience in front of them and decided to voice my complaints after they returned home.  My parents left Vegas on 6/14. On 6/15 I spoke with Mr. Russo and described to him all of the items above, and he said he would talk to the server and get back to me.  He asked me to send a copy of our receipt to his email address, which I did on 6/17.  As of 6/30, I still had not received any response.  I sent a follow-up email, and his response was as follows:\n\n\"Good evening Mr. ******,\nI apologize for the delay,\nI spoke to the Manager to the chef and to the server on duty on June the 10th. The manager said that none of our customer complained or asked to talk to him that day. The chef said that he didn't get any complain about calamari or salmon. The server said that it was no leftover food during your lunch.\nI can only apologize if our food didn't meet your expectations. If we were aware of your complain at the moment, we would have been able to make your experience a better one.\nBest regards,\n\nZeffirino Restaurant\nFabio Russo\nGeneral Manager\"\n\nDid not address a single issue I brought up or the poor service from the waiter.  Great management.  Hope this place goes out of business."

This was one of the best meals I had all year! \n\nI have to admit I did feel a little underdressed but the staff didn't seem upset by that at all! They were very kind and attentive and I believe they were all from Italy! We had a table where we could watch the gondola singers down below. We ordered the Risotto Gamberi e Granchio half order which had crabmeat in the risotto-so delicious! and a side of linguine to go with the NY Times \"best meal ever\" Zuppetta del Doge di Venezia which had half a lobster, scallops, shrimp, crab, and asparagus. Yum, yum, yum! This meal was 8 days ago and I've mentioned it to everyone I've talked to about my trip! We have another conference in March and will 100% have to come back and either just order the exact same thing because it was so memorable or maybe venture and try another one of their dishes. I definitely recommend coming here for a nice and delicious Italian dinner while you're in Las Vegas!"

I didn't know what to expect since the entire event was planned online and I only had pictures and reviews to go off. The ambiance of the space is great...a lot to see and amazing bathrooms! The main dining areas are on the patio and up stairs, they also have a large bar which is great if you don't want to sit in the dining room. \n\nThe reception was fantastic. We had a private room, passed items (chicken skewers, risotto balls, shrimp, and more), TONS of fresh vegetables, lasagna, carved ham & turkey, etc. The restaurant also did my cake (white cake with chocolate mousse). I was told by multiple people that it was by far the best wedding cake they had ever eaten, and I have to agree...it was fantastic! Additionally, they brought out pastries which were also great. I have not eaten from the main menu at the restaurant, but from my experience they were great! I also had an appetizer sampler and a pizza at the bar after the event which were both good. I would highly recommend Zeffirino's for your next event or if you're looking for a dinner that is not at stuffy as some of the other options in the area."

We said natural thinking this is their regular tap water. The waiter came back and poured water for us from a bottle. We didn't think anything of it. When the bill came, we were charged $20 for 3 bottles of natural water. I think they are a little deceiving. So becareful when the waiter asked what kind of water you want."

I didn't have an issue with asking our server, but i think it's definately a way to get you in the door and they \"forget to give it to you\" when seated because ONE entree is the price of the price fix.\n\nI had a very good fettucini alfredo (a side dish i asked for entree size- a gracious yes), and my husband had what he calls the best veal parm he's ever had (he says this every time he has veal parm). we coupled this with only a ceasar salad split and the house bread (very good, airy crusty bread).\n\nI will say the pasta was FRESH pasta which made this italian girl happy. I felt this was authentic italian, everything tasted fresh. It was a bit pricey, and to me, this all equals average because i'm used to these restaurants in Philadelphia."

It reminded me of the pleasant escape of that restaurant inside Pirates of the Caribbean: a calming respite from the noisy crowds just a few feet away.   The decor inside enhanced the elegant feel, with rich antique furniture and fixtures.  During the meal, musicians wandered from table to table, keeping us entertained.\n\nI opted for the prix fixe dinner menu for $40, which opened with a so-so crusty bread and pleasant olive tapenade, followed by an okay plate of fried calimari, nicely flavored and textured ravioli, and an decent Chicken Marsala.  Dessert was a bit of a letdown, consisting of three bite-sized (for a very small-jawed creature, perhaps a diminutive early hominid, which, despite appearances,  I am not) and forgettable cakes.  I'm sure they would have been nicer than the petit fours in a Hickory Farms Christmas gift box, but I couldn't get a good taste of the damned things, they were so small.\n\nI've breezed over the meal by design - the star of this place is the setting.  The only flaw in the movie set was a hole in the napkin.\n\nService was very good, with very little wait between courses.  Being part of the 5:00 pm senior citizen crowd, they waitstaff knew we were there to eat and were not going to keep us from the Murder She Wrote marathon starting at 6pm.\n\nWould I return?  Probably not, with so many other otherworldly experiences in Vegas to try."

It seems to be the simplest of Italian dishes that encompasses everything good about Italian food. A well done pasta and a tasty meat sauce that is spiced just right - something basic that mama teaches you.I know - it's a stupid rule but one that has worked for me nonetheless.  \n\nMy bolognese at this joint came in lumpy and absent of taste. The waitstaff take their time to get to you (and it wasn't busy at all) unless they are bringing you the cheque. My wife ordered the veal and it was overdone. We had a third person in our party that ordered a eggplant parm (which is pretty much the only vegetarian thing they had)  - and that was done relatively well. \n\nI can see the charm in wanting to eat here - but it's just not worth the price in my humble estimation. I've eaten good Italian food in Italy, NYC, Philadelphia and L.A. I am yet to find a place that matches that definition in Las Vegas."

My largest negative is the price gauging due to being on the strip.  While the pastas were not insane - $30 and $26, the portion of my chicken was laughable.  Also, in true strip fashion, we were given the \"water\" option of sparkling or bottled - but tap was not mentioned and I forgot how the system works.  $8 for water - sorry, embarrassing.\n\nOverall - a good dining option that could have been amazing with just a couple minor tweaks."

Just like the small restaurants in Rome there is a chalkboard with all the specials and a menu to peruse and bring you in.  A gorgeous dark cozy bar with a 40ft ceiling is in in plain view and a set of stairs will take you up to the top. I was almost tempted just to stop and have a Bellini at the lounge.\n\nWe were lucky to sit upstairs near an open window facing the Grand Canal inside the Venetian shops.  The decor is Old World with lots of oil paintings, furniture imported from Italy, tiles, chandeliers and stuccoed walls.  The fine China is adorned with its namesake so you won't forget where you're eating.\n\nThe hubby and I started out with a glass of Prossecco, which is the Italian version of Champagne-so you should order a glass from the Sommelier .  It was fruity, crisp, refreshing and romantic.  \n\nThe reason we chose to come here was they offered my favorite...Pasta Carbonara!  We had a very early dinner so the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  Service was polite but I think he was a bit annoyed that we didn't order an appetizer.  However, the pasta was not on the menu but he made it for me anyway.  I remember seeing it on the lunch special but it was dinner time...nonetheless I was graciously accommodated.\n\nThe menu is incredible with tons of options!  Foie Gras (which can also be ordered as  side dish), Filet, Lobster, Shrimp, pasta...and the dessert which is freshly made in the restaurant.  \n\nMy pasta was brought out and it was perfection!  The hubby ordered lasagna and he was very satisfied although he wished he would have ordered something less boring.\n\nWe skipped dessert but not to worry, the bakery out in the shops are the same desserts (the restaurant makes them), so if you don't have room, walk it off and have a coffee and Tiramisu later. \n\nPrices are comparable to decent restaurants on the strip. Appetizers start at $20 and up to $110 for a seafood platter.  The nice thing is the event space can accommodate at least s120 people for dinner, as an event planner, this is good news.\n\nOverall,  a nice place to try at least once for a special occasion or for locals... for that much needed date night."

It's rather dark inside but the restaurant area is on the second floor and is somewhat narrow but nice.  They boast that it's the only 2nd floor seating in the entire Grand Canal.  Woo.\n\nWe had a fixed menu since there were nearly 50 of us.  We only chose the drinks and one of three entrees.  The appetizer (radicchio, mozzarella and speck) and salad were uninspired, as was the bread and butter.  Seriously this is VEGAS, there should be like lava in the butter, or the bread should be red, or there should be a nude lady dancing on the table.  COME ON!\n\nI ordered the beef medallions.  Again, uninspired.  They were a bit salty and had a sauce on top.  And we all know truly good beef needs no sauce.  It seemed that the sea bass was the best of the three dishes.  The wine for the most part was good, but we hit a really nasty one and switched over from red to white.  The service was average, but why would you expect anything better if they've already been paid up front with a fixed menu service?\n\nThe saving grace was the dessert tray.  Large 20\" trays of bite-sized desserts were presented to us.  There were so many to choose from and every one that I tried was fantastic.  We all joked that it must have been brought in externally since we saw no indication of a pastry chef and the quality of dessert to the rest of the meal was complete incongruous.\n\nAll in all, not impressed.  There are a bunch of other places to go in Vegas, and I'm eyeing that new Cut place in Palazzo."

I am NOT a \"foodie\" and, as such, am rarely disappointed with a meal; however, this was an unexpected exception.  Perched overlooking the grand canal, Zeffirino has so much potential to be a pleasantly memorable experience.  Unfortunately for a place that will run you at least $150 for two people, the food is shockingly bad.  My wife had the half lobster and seafood entree the waiter exuberantly recommended and I went for their dinner set.  In both cases presentation was acceptable but certainly poorer than you would expect.  The food itself, unfortunately, was about what you would expect from a low budget casino buffet....dried-out and seemingly more than a day old.  Maybe we just caught them at a bad time (7pm on a Sunday) but you just really don't expect a place like this to have days this bad.  I am not sure how they stay in business, but have to assume it's only because, like me, the unique location makes many people willing to ignore the bad food reviews.  With so many excellent restaurants to choose from in Vegas, I definitely will not be returning here."

After about 15-20 mins, a host saw that our waiter was overwhelmed so he decided to help out and take our appetizers and entree orders. Guess what time we got our salads? 10:15pm. So an hour and a half we JUST got our 1st course. Are you f*ckin serious? As the manager set our salad down to our table, I asked him if they were short staffed and told him our wait time. He apologized and quickly went off to try to alleviate the problem. 5 mins later, our entrees came while we JUST started on our salad.... By this time, we were just happy to eat. \n\nWhy 3 stars instead of 1? Well the manager really did a good job on making the situation better. He was genuinely apologetic, came by every 5-7 mins to see how we were doing, help cracked open our seafood, two free drinks and made sure we were content. Towards the end, we received complementary mini desserts. \n\nOverall, the food was ok. Service was short staffed but they made a point to correct and make their customers happy."

            "review": "Richly ornate and serene, Zeffirino is an Italian restaurant located in the Venetian Casino Canal area. The restaurant is rather \"snazzy\" and  can be perceived by the casual observer  as too expensive for the general casino patrons that frequent the passage ways of the casinos to window shop and gamble.  However, surprisingly the price was average of what is expected to that of any other Italian restaurant anywhere away from the strip.  Pleasantly surprised Zeffirino has a happy hour that is again like that of any standard restaurant with an average of $2-3 off on particular wines and cocktails.  I ordered the mussel and clam combination in white wine sauce as an appetizer and Chicken Marsala as an entree.  The  food was balanced, fresh, and appropriately portioned.  The mussels and clams were delightful and plentiful.  The Chicken Marsala was extremely light in sauce and intended in such a way to delicately enhance the well prepared breast of chicken.  We opted to dine at the bar versus the lavishly ornate and \"fine dining\" themed restaurant on the second floor.  You can say we were both intimidated and trying to eat in the \"cheap\" for lunch on the Las Vegas strip.  The bartender which served us was genuine and personal.  In the bar area is a pianist that plays intermittently throughout the day, which is was very nice but acoustically overwhelming at times.  While I hardly mention restrooms in my reviews, I have to mention the ladies' restroom was exceptionally ornate like the restaurant and flawlessly clean.  Each stall has its own vanity with all the accouterments to freshen oneself.  I did notice that I was not the only one to take notice of the uniqueness of the restrooms as I noticed an award dated in 2008 or 2009  for the \"Best Restrooms in Las Vegas\".  Interestingly enough, there is a lot of history involving the establishment of Zeffirino that is captured upstairs outside the dinning area.  May I add there is easy accessibility to the dining area for anyone that requires an elevator.  Besides the overly ornate and intimate setting of the restaurant, Zeffirino has its own elevator to add the lavish experience"

I would recommend it to anyone looking for an upscale Italian restaurant  \n I started with a couple peronis and fried calamari which was excellent light and crispy batter served piping hot and delicious  next had a nice Ceasar salad surprisingly no anchovies and slightly too much dressing. I opted for the surf and turf which was very very good except for the lobster tail which unfortunately was over cooked dry and rubbery I normally would have sent it back but decided to eat it. The surf n turf cones with tenderloin medallion (which was perfect) shrimp (which they were willing to substitute for a scallop) asparagus potatoes and rapini (similar to spinach)\n The Ma\u00eetre D recommended a very nice bottle of Amarone. I was a little disappointed to discover they charged 3 to 4 times the retail price for this bottle. Even though it was a nice bottle I believe about 2 to 3 times is normal. \n\nAll in all it was a very very good meal and I look forward to eating there again"

The Chicken parm was good but someone's arm hurts in the kitchen because the chicken was so flat that you almost couldn't tell if it was veal or chicken, I guess this isn't a terrible thing. Just not traditional in my opinion (I also think I make the best chicken parm in the world). Anyways, i give the desserts 5 stars. Their pastry chef is working hard back there and the chocolate and little fancy truffles and whatevers were melt in your mouth delicious.

So we came for dinner on Christmas night. We didn't order much because we are not the type that can eat multiple course meal without leftover (and we don't want to have leftover during our trip). So I ordered a lasagna and he ordered a veal ravioli. \nThe lasagna was as good as it was years ago, I am pleased. My husband's veal ravioli was good too but a bit too sweet for him. I tasted it too and the filling was a bit sweet (not sugary sweet, I think it's certain seasoning and the veal meat giving the sweet taste). They also have a violinist and a guitar player playing Christmas music from table to table all night long. So the ambiance was good. Some servers had a stern face though, and they dressed in suits, they looked so stern as if they were government agents. Well, they don't look rude, just don't know why they are so stern.......\nAll we wanted there was their pasta as they made their own. And we are happy that we ordered the pasta and not the $39 4-course meal. But it's just us. You might like to have 4 course meal instead if you need to have salad and appetizer for your meal. \nFor ladies, make sure you visit their restroom too. It's well decorated. And each stall has its own sink inside, so once you are in a stall, you can take your time to freshen up with comfort and your own space. I asked my husband and he said there is not much going on in male's restroom. So I guess they only did the fancy design for the ladies' room."

Every other aspect of this restaurant deserve zero stars. \n\nThe slow, confused service staff asked us what we ordered several times and still didn't know who ordered what when they brought it. It was like watching the Keystone Kops as waiters. There was even a manager involved at one part. It was total chaos and the antithesis of relaxing. \n\nWhen they finally put our food in front of us, it was a sad, tiny dish. I ordered the ravioli. They brought 5 of the most limp, flat, and bland ravioli I have ever seen in my life. This is what you get for a $30 dish. \n\nI'm not sure how they've stayed in business \"since 1939.\" I guess businesses can stay open longer in high tourism areas because they rely on the ignorance of their patrons and not on repeat business.\n\nps: I was just looking at other reviews (I don't read them before writing because I don't want them to color mine.). I am so confused at the comments calling this \"fine\" dining. Unless they mean it was \"fine\" as in just tolerable. This is NOT a fine dining experience. Olive Garden has friendlier, more competent service. I promise you."

While there's nothing exotic about the food preparation, it's seriously delicious.  We tried the Zefferino house labeled champagne that was on special for the day, but it left a lot to be desired.  \n\nThe service was mediocre at best; refills were difficult, the waiter ofter forgot our requests, forcing us to follow up when we could catch him.  \n\nThe deceptively delicious food was enjoyed by all, until after the meal.  Everyone in our party of 8 grew violently ill from food poisoning.  This was the only meal we ate all day, which we would pay for all night long.

Ambiance was nice, if you like to watch a shopping mall from where you're sitting (we got seated in a \"nice\" location overlooking the toilet blue water, gondolas and the Kenneth Cole store). The interior is nice, but nothing special if you're a foodie and dine out often. The service was average, a small hint of pretense included.\n\nWe went in expecting a nice dinner and ordered the following:\n--Appetizer: Sauted clams and black mussels with garlic, white wine, capers and parsley\nThis was not good. It looked like it would be delicious when presented at our table. There was a light garlic sauce covering the mussels and clams which was quite good by itself. However, the actual shellfish was completely bland and some were too chewy, like they cooked them too long. Overall, it left a lot to be desired.\n\n--Entrees: \n1) Homemade pasta sauted with lobster, white wine and baby Shrimp in a Light Tomato sauce\nThis dish was pretty average fare. There was one large lobster claw and a bunch of baby shrimp, so they definitely didn't skimp on the seafood. The sauce was pretty flavorful and the noodles were cooked well. It just wasn't orgasmically delicious. Oh, and the serving size was Buca-esque, which, to me, isn't a good sign for a supposedly \"fine dining\" establishment.\nAlso, it was garnished with a random piece of purple cabbage and parsley. PARSLEY?? seriously?? I thought this was a classy joint!\n\n2) Pan seared breaded veal loin, topped with tomato, mozzarella and parmigiano served with sauted tomato pasta\nThis was my bf's dish. He didn't like the veal which was SMOTHERED in cheese but he said the pasta was alright.\n\nSince neither of us are wine-lovers, we just ordered a few cocktails, much to our server's dismay. He was visibly bothered by our decision to skip the wine (it was funny and odd at the same time). Oh and a bottle of Aqua Panna still water is $8, just to let you know in case you were hoping for free water :)\n\nWe skipped dessert. Check was $150 for two. Meh.\n\nThe highlight of this place? It has the nicest bathroom's I've ever seen. Each stall is it's own little private room complete with a clear vessel sink and cloth towels. They also had a variety of hand lotions for use in the hallway outside the bathrooms."

When Sinatra passed away, Zeffirino sent his wife, Barbara, a massive amount of the food that they loved to eat together. We were shopping at the Venetian resort in Las Vegas,  when a charming employee beckoned us inside the Las Vegas incarnation of Zeffirino, where we decided to have a full dinner. And boy, were we full when we finally rolled out of there after a fantastic, authentic Italian-style meal.\n\nFirst, the bread was light and tasty; butter and olive oil came with it. Then, to paraphrase Louis Prima, we ate antipasto twice just because it was so nice.\n\nMy husband had the lasagne, which was prepared the traditional way with salsa balsamella (Italian for B\u00e9chamel), cheese and a rich meat sauce. (On our second visit, I tried the lasagne too, and it is fantastic.)\n\nI had pasta with meat sauce, and it was stupendous. We were treated extremely well by the elegant wait-staff, and noticed on our way out that Zeffirino's roving musicians were tuning up their instruments in order to entertain Saturday night diners. Someday soon, we will return to that lovely, classically-decorated restaurant, Zeffirino."

OK, then you should deal with it like any restaurant should! Which he did not.

Snappy, unfriendly, unsmiling waiters took our orders mere seconds after we sat down. Snatched menus from under our noses, and then stood around staring at us as the big party came to a finish...when we went to the bathroom they started separating out our tables to let us know they wanted us to go. There were a few rockstars in the waiters who were helpful, but the rest...not so much.\n\nFood wise, I can't believe that this place survives in the Venetian with so many other absolutely amazing places around it. It's not like they charge less for okay food. \n\nThe one good thing was the ravioli, which i'd expect out of an Italian place, but everything else was a little too salty and dry. However, was surprised that my seabass was not overcooked, so props on that since fish can be hard to get just right. Unfortunately, mini-desserts were not even worth the time or calories.\n\nThe tab wasn't mine though, so I don't look a food gift-horse in the mouth, and the company was worth all the negatives, but I would have easily paid for a better meal elsewhere.

Put this in a baguette with some sliced provolone and you would have the perfect roast beef sandwich! \n* The baked salmon is amazing! It has whole garlic cloves tucked into the fillet so the flavor is quite intense yet still a perfect pairing with the fatty salmon.\n* Raviolis bathing in a pesto cream sauce are cooked al dente and the pesto cream sauce is outrageous! It's packed full of flavor and will not disappoint.\n* A tray of thinly sliced meats like prosciutto and salami glisten with fatty goodness. The cured flavors are on mark and are excellent.\n* Carved filet mignon with marsala mushroom sauce is cooked to a perfect rare to medium-rare and so tender you can cut it with a butter knife.\n* Thinly sliced smoked salmon is tender and melts in your mouth like butter. The red onion and capers are the perfect pairing giving it a balanced flavor.\n* Antipasto bar with marinated porcini and portobello mushrooms are fabulous and work well with the sliced cured meats.\n* Dessert, dessert! Homemade tiramisu is to die for! It's decadent, creamy, and just the right amount of espresso flavor. Mini fruit tarts with zabaglione custard inside and mini cakes are like little works of art.\n\nThumbs up, way up!"

Had an interview in the Venetian and wanted to find a quiet place to do some work and eat a nice lunch beforehand, and was immediately drawn to their $19.95 three-course lunch special that served vegetarian dishes. I was intrigued, and I went in to enjoy a pricey lunch. \n\nPricey, but worth it most definitely. I was taken to the second floor and sat myself in a more well-lit corner. The decor was so pretty and very classy but still had a comfortable quality to it. \n\nI had some of the best service I have ever received from a restaurant here. They weren't particularly busy, but even after I paid my check they kept coming back to ask if I wanted fresh hot water for my tea. Superb service where I did not have to ask for anything, and they actually went above and beyond. \n\nFor my first course I had the soup of the day, which was a vegan lentil soup. It was a sizable portion and was very good, and I scarfed it down more quickly than intended. \n\nMy second course I savored every little bite. I ordered cheese ravioli in a fettuccine sauce with truffle oil. The truffle oil in this dish really took it over the top, in a good way. The mix of cheesy flavors with that hint of truffle oil is absolutely divine. It's not a huge dish, but it does satiate you well enough. \n\nThe final course I had hot organic mint tea with three little pastries. I don't know what they were really but they were like little bites of heaven! One was a tiny nut brownie, the other was some sort of soft, chocolate ball of deliciousness, and the last one was a cup of maybe custard with a strawberry on top with strawberry sauce on the plate. SO good. \n\nThe service, the ambiance, the food, even the bathrooms - all swanky and amazing. (Seriously, they have mouthwash in the bathrooms with your own personal sink and vanity. Way cool!) When I get a job I will definitely be back here. This is a lunch you don't plow through even though they do pace it very nicely. This is something to savor and take your time with, and enjoy conversation while overhearing the gondola singers below. Romantic and wonderful, and I felt like I was in Europe and not on the Vegas strip. A+ all around, I will definitely be back to enjoy another afternoon of pure bliss at Zeffirino."

            "review": "I really wish there was a half star rating, because Las Vegas has such a variety of restaurants, particularly Italian restaurants at The Venetian alone, that while this one was good, I would probably try something else next time.  I would say this is a 3 and a half star place.\n\nThat said, my boss and I were in Vegas for a meeting and came across this place while strolling along The Grand Canal.  As expected in Vegas this restaurant is huge, and when we were there, virtually empty.  However, at our request to have a table along the canal, the hostess said, \"Let me check with that section to see if we have room\".  That irritated me, especially after she returned 5 minutes later said it was okay if we sat on the canal, and when we got to our table, the room was about 1/4 full.  It was an unnecessary pretentious touch, IMO.  \n\nBut things got much better!  The friendly Sommelier came over and we ordered a nice CA Cabernet (I know...should have gone Italian but the boss had a favorite wine, and I can never complain about Napa Cabs).  The Sommelier was very very knowledgeable about terroir, so we had an interesting conversation with him.  He was enthusiastic, and clearly passionate about his work.  \n\nThe food was great, also.  We had a lovely Salumi plate, with cold cuts, cheese and black olives.  If  you don't want quite that much, the bread (OMG that Italian bread!) comes with little skewers of salami, cheese and olives, so that would have been fine.\n\nThe menu is full of standard Italian fare, lots of variety.  I wanted to order something that stood up to the very bold wine, and the Veal Scallopine did the trick.  It was a very rich mushroom sauce, with roasted tomatoes, served atop a mound of homemade fettuccine.  My boss had the beef tenderloin, that came swimming (in a good way) in a a sauce of red wine, grapes and pine nuts.  It was also served with a side of pasta.  The portions here are HUGE.  \n\nThis place is pricey, but it is fine dining.\n\nWe waddled out without dessert, and this meal sustained me through a long night at the casino, into mid day the next day.  So, don't get me wrong.  I DO recommend this place.  There are just too many restaurants, and too little time!\n\nThe atmosphere is beautiful.  The detail that went into the design is incredible.  I heard that the 40 foot tall, handcrafted bar was imported from Italy, and I have no reason not to believe it."

You will want to call me up and thank me profusely for giving you such valuable and mouth-watering advice...believe me.\n\nI had set out with the fam in search of steak and seafood...a little surf and turf if you will...and they all wanted Italian.  Well, somehow we ended up at Zeffirino because my honey said he saw \"filet medallions\" on the menu...\n\nSOOOOOO not sad that we stumbled inside!  \n\nFirst of all, the decor is fantastic...a virtual maze will lead you upstairs to a sort of Moroccan feel of a room...complete with open windows yielding views of the painted sky outside.  You really do feel as if you are somewhere in Italy and not in a casino...\n\nThe staff are all Italian...that's a plus!  And the food...THE FOOD...Holy Hell.  I had a special of filet medallions (three...and perfectly cooked...slightly crunchy on the outside and perfect pink inside!) in a fondue type sauce, topped with a light pomegranate sauce and coupled with green beans and the most delightful, crispy little potatoes. My honey had some sort of pasta tube stuffed with something and covered in a Beschamel sauce and topped with BLACK TRUFFLES!!  Yummmmm.  The sea bass in lemon sauce looked divine...\n\nAs for the desserts...you won't be remiss with the hazelnut gelato, the tiramisu (which is served in a martini glass) or the white/milk/dark chocolate mousse.  So incredibly scrumptious and all the portions were just enough to fill you without making you ill.\n\nCan't tell you the overall cost as we were treated by a family member...I can tell you that my entree alone was $44 so it's not on the cheaper side by any means.  But seriously, it was worth the cost!\n\nAnd best part, this man and his son come around and serenade you with violins...lovely!!\n\nGreat for an intimate dinner as well as for a large party!"

We arrived at 6:30 and received our dinner at about 8:40.  We had to get our desserts to go, because we had a show at the Monte Carlo starting at 930. I had to ask for a refill of my wine because I was not asked if I wanted another. There was nothing spectacular about the food. The restaurant was very beautiful though. I ordered from the fixed menu because the real menu was MASSIVE! The musician came to our table twice. The first time he was given a tip. The second unsolicited visit he rendered us the evil eye after playing selections he dedicated to an older gentleman in our party. He advised us that he was not paid, but earned his living from tips. Lucky I had a twenty dollar bill in my purse or else I think we would have still been there under his uncomfortable stares. Most tourist I know do not walk around with cash, so he should probably ask before bestowing a second serenade if the patrons would like to pay for additional songs."

Near the entrance of the Gondolas, they have a restaurant that says \"the bar\" which you will need to go into, and then upstairs is the restaurant which is the only way to get there.  \n\nThe interior of the restaurant itself has an old glamour atmosphere to it, with countless photos hung around, and articles scattered away.  It has an amazing design and gives an authentic Italian energy just as you walk through the doors.  The floors were a bit slippery, I almost tripped while walking around the long hallways; but, none the less, they were beautiful.  The silverware was decorated superbly but my fork was bent, and I just can't eat with a bent fork.\n\nTHE SERVICE -\n\nI did not make reservations here, but got seated immediately which was awesome (since I was wearing 6-inch non platform heels, walking almost all day)!  The food came at a slow pace and the servers spilled half my cocktail on the table but the maitre'd was nice enough to clean up my spilled juice and give a new drink free-of-charge. \n\n\n\nTHE FOOD -\n\nMy friend and I started off our dining experience with their Ostriche Fresche which are fresh oysters of six for $15.00, a very good price for the delectable fresh taste.  The side dish of fettuccine Alfredo was nectarous; I don't know how the chefs cooked it, but it was saccharine and brilliantly executed.  \n\nMy first course arrived: a plate of Salmon in white wine, the balsamic outer layer of the lemon zest and capers made the fish oh so brackish.  Freshly-made couscous is one of the humble triumphs of civilization.  The miniature diced tomatos were steamed to perfection, the couscous was delicious and added a kick to the dish, I couldn't have ask for a better meal. \n\nMy friend's Ravioli that had Parmigiano cheese, served in pink sauce looked like throw up on a plate. Even the grated cheese did not make it look any more presentable.  Enough said.\n\n\nTo recap, we ordered the following:\n\nOstriche Fresche - Fresh Oysters Order of 6 ($14.95)\n\nFettuccine alla Bolognese ($26.00)\n\nRavioli in Salsa Rosa ($26.00)\n\nSalmone alla Griglia ($36.00)"

Members of our party looked at the menu, then were asked by the hostess \"Do you want to sit upstairs?\" \"Sure!\" they told her, indifferent about our elevation while eating.\n\nApparently, upstairs is the \"fancier\" area, which does not serve the pizza listed on the menu. Holly H. asked if there was a way we could order it, since it WAS on the menu displayed. \"No.\" the waiter flatly told us. We tried to get an explanation, but none made sense (and, with 12 of us already sitting down, we decided against making a scene and leaving).\n\nMost of us ended up ordering the \"25 dollar lunch special,\" a solid deal as it comes with an appetizer/salad, an entree, and a dessert.\n\nI had the ceasar salad and the chicken parm. The salad was very good - the \"authentic\" kind that just comes with one large piece of lettuce that you make yourself. The chicken parm was tasty, though the chicken:pasta ratio was low.  \n\nThe server was extremely kind and professional after what we all took as initial rudeness (probably more of a cultural barrier). And the food was good, not great. I was starting to sweeten on Zeffirino's, until I learned later that we were charged $24 for water - I have never been given bottled water without asking!\n\nI'd go somewhere else next time where I didn't constantly feel like the restaurant was trying to pull a fast one"

I'm a huge fan of them, know the're cheap when you buy them in bulk and easy to prepare. But.........these were canned :(.

The decor is certainly impressive and we had a private area at the back.  We ordered some pretty expensive brunello and appetizers.   When we ordered dinner, I decided to have seafood rather than steak because I had been having steak all week.  There is a very interesting pasta dish which call for a one pound lobster plus many other shell fish so I ordered that.\n\nWhen the dish came, there was a lobster head and tail plus clams and mussels and bay shrimp but there was NO lobster in the dish.  So I tried five minutes looking for a piece of lobster and couldn't find one.  So I had the waiter come over and asked.   The first one said the lobster was in the sauce.  So I tried to imaging may be they did it like a bisque style to morcellate the lobster.  But the sauce did not taste lobster, it was a spicy tomato sauce.   So I get another waiter and then the manager to come over.  They finally told us the truth that they RAN OUT OF LOBSTER. and the chef did not tell them.   Now, can any of you tell me how a reputable restaurant can put a dish on a customer table which misrepresent completely what it was supposed to be (put a lobster head and tail and pretend there is lobster).  By the way this was one of the more pricy dish (I believe about $50).    When I ask one of the other golfers who ordered another lobster dish which also called for a pound of lobster whether his had any lobster.  And he also said there was very little.   When encountered this with the manager (Gary O.), he was obviously embarrassed and took the dishes off and comp some wine.  However, I really think that still does not compensate what really happened which essentially was a fraud of misrepresenting the dish and charging people for it.\n\nI looked around the room and saw the place packed.   How many would have ordered the lobster dish, ate what is not lobster and got ripped off.  To be fair, as one of our fellow guest said, this is NOT a high end restaurant.  It is a hotel restaurant in the Venetian which appear to be high end.   They have decent decor and great utensils and frankly, OK food.   But they are by no means a high end restaurant or run by the family.   This is Vegas afterall.  The manager was a mid level worker who probably does not have much say and have some limited resource for comping.  One of the guest went to talk to the Maitre D and was promise to tell the \"owner\" but I seriously doubt that.   \n\nBut one main question remained.    If there was no lobster, where did the lobster head and tail came from???"

There are at least 6 or 7 of them but my fav to date is Canaletto's.\nThe hotel was packed and it was an iffy proposition getting a table at Canaletto's. Upon arriving the hostess says 60-70 minute wait! \"Not Going To Happen\" on my watch so we walked the 60 yards to Zeffirino's.\n\nIt was almost empty? What the hell I thought. One Italian restaurant is mobbed and some 60 yards away one is almost empty. Well, that was not a good sign. But we were seated by a very nice hostess and showered with very good bread, water and an opening gratis appetizer. OK so far. So why is this place not doing business?\nWe all ordered, and the food came at the right temperture, and it was fresh and tasted good and so on and so on and.........So what gives? I couldn't figure it out. Maybe the outdoor (actually indoor) seating at Canaletto's? Maybe the light airy atmosphere at Canaletto's as opposed to the darker more traditional look of Zeffirino's? Could it be the creepy stuffed mannequinn of Luciano Pavarotti in the foray? Probably not.\nWell it certainly wasn't the service or the food. This restaurant was very good and I would go back! They had fresh homemade pastas, very fresh fish, a mediocre (though) caesar salad, but very good aged parmigiano-reggiano cheese. \nIt was nice dinner for being a second choice. We finished our dinner just about the same time we would have been seated at Canaletto's. We did right by coming here."

We had the pre fix, not that the price was the problem just that the food was mediocre at best and when considering an establishment for a decent dining experience one would think you would not be served individual wraped breakfast butters with your bread basket :).  The beef carpaccio was prosciutto with an arugala salad on top, the veal parmesan was pretty delicious, well seasoned and tender and the pastry shop deserts were lack lustre and unimpressive.  The staff was attentive and wonderful and gave us great service. Unfortunately the atmosphere and ambiance was like sitting in the food court in a themed italian chateaux.   Well it is the venetian casino so I should have known better.  We were looking for something a little more high end with a culinary experience and I feel it fell short.  When in vegas make the trip out to Nora's italian restaurant if you want some GREAT and fabulous italian food in vegas."

We stayed at the Venetian, and it was the restaurant directly outside our elevator. I was starving and it was right there! So we walked up to the hostess with no reservation and were promptly seated. We had to take an elevator to the 2nd floor and were sat by the open wall/window (we're on the first floor of a hotel and the 2nd floor of the restaurant - inside yet sitting on a \"patio\" with a view of the outside? Only in Vegas). We had a really nice view of the canal and gondola rides. We ordered the prix fixe dinner and it was delicious. All small portions but enough that you walk out completely satisfied but not to the point you can't walk because your  bursting at the seams. The waiter recommended a Merlot with my meal, that I really enjoyed. My favorite was the asparagus soup and pesto raviolis, the fried calamari was really good too. It came with dessert and coffee, the dessert could have been larger but oh well. They were like 4 teeny little bite size pieces. Overall they had great service, great food, great atmosphere. Super romantic and relaxing, a nice escape from the hectic Vegas we all know."

It is another gem and definitely going to be on our list to return to on future visits. We had a great meal and wonderful service from Mario and Ricardo. \nI started with the Sangria-- OMG, which after my friend tried (she was still debating what to get) she took and I had to order another one. \nWe agreed that the chef had a very subtle hand with flavors, which we both loved. I had the lentil soup and it was probably one of the best lentil soups I have had. I then chose the chicken park, my friend had the eggplant parm-- we would order both again. \nWe did the special 3 course meal as part of restaurant week, during which a portion of proceeds go to the charity Three Square to feed the hungry. So the third course was a selection of 3 mini desserts-- all good. However, when I go back, I am getting a full size tiramisu. It rivaled any I had in Italy and is definitely in my top 3 ever. \nThe view is nice as you overlook the grand canal, you can hear the gondolieres singing, and it's a nice relaxing respite from the craziness of the casinos."

We decided to go in after looking at the menu and we were escorted upstairs overlooking the gondola rides,  absolutely beautiful view! Our waiter was absolutely awesome his name was Mario you should definitely ask for him great attention to detail and excellent service. We started with the calamari and the caprese salad the calamari was the best I've ever had very lightly fried and the sauce on the side was fantastic sometimes calamari can be rubbery,  this was definitely not the case it was perfect ! My salad was fresh light and delicious very light on the oil which is usually my pet peeve with this salad this one was spot on. For our entrees I had the angel hair with tomato and garlic it was unbelievable and my husband had the veal parmesan he said it was the best veal he has had in a very long time.\n The desert was yummy a small plate of 3 little pastries for lunch one was like a tiny tiramisu the other was a tiny raspberry dessert and the third was some mango thing they were cute and very good! It was a great lunch. We definitely recommend this restaurant and we will be back!"

Turned out quite small, but appropriately priced. For my entree, I ordered Aragosta Diavolo, which was to feature a 1.5 lb lobster, shrimp, clams, scallops over linguini. I like lobster. I don't love it, but like it quite a bit. I've lived in Maine for 15 years now, and I know a 1-1/2 pound lobster when I see and eat one. This pipsqueak weighed in no more than a pound. It was boiled to mush and generally terrible. The rest of the dish was excellent, but not spicy like the \"Diavolo\" implied. Not worth the $60 I paid."

We requested a window seat so that we could watch the gondola passing under us.  They seated us in an inside room surrounded by 3 walls.  We refused to take the table because the canal view was what attracted us to this restaurant in the first place.  The hostess then took us to a table one row away from the window.  We were told all the tables by the windows were reserved.  It wouldn't bother us if those tables were really reserved.  No, at least half a dozen tables were left empty throughout our lunch there.  Why weren't we assigned to those unoccupied tables?  Couple of the hostess assistants looked Asian to me, was it discrimination because we were fellow Asians?  Or because we had kids in our party?  I took off a couple of stars for the dishonest hostess or whatever reasons we were treated that way.\n\nThe waiting service was quite good.  The meals were just mediocre.  It was a disappointment when we spent almost $150 on lunch for 2 adults and 2 kids.

Since she had been dying for some Italian food, we figured we'd take the hit on the price and dine here. Very, very glad we did.\nWe came at about 4 pm, which meant they were not very busy, allowing us a seat right next to the balcony, where we could look at the canal below, people watch, and listen to the gondola singers. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very casual, quiet, and kind of like a small Italian restaurant would look, although this place is pretty damn big. \nService was spectacular from start to finish. Our server was very polite, very attentive, and took great care of every part of this meal. Had to laugh when he poured my girlfriend's beer, then told me he would allow me to have the pleasure of pouring my own... which I did.\nThe food... fantastic. The free bread they give you during the meal was DELICIOUS, and that was the free bread! Salads- great. The pasta- unbelievable. The lasagna- out of this world. There seemed to be an awful lot of choices on the menu I would've gone with, a lot seemed to be very complicated with many ingredients and combinations, and I'm glad I decided to keep it simple.\nOverall, very pleased with this place. The service was top notch, I felt like royalty dining here. The food was absolutely delicious, and I left absolutely fat and happy. Only thing keeping it from five stars- no beer on tap (they have some downstairs in the waiting room?), and it can be a bit pricey depending on what you order. However, I very much enjoyed the meal and experience, and will most likely dine here again the next time I'm in the Venetian canal. Very well done."

I would not recommend this to anyone else.\n\nFirst off, they put our table of 8 in a great big round booth. Keep in mind, the meal was served as a buffet- so basically everyone had to go at once or there was a lot of standing around waiting, changing places, etc. There was an empty table made for 9 people but they refused to move us there.\n\nSecond, the buffet. Without even getting to the food- it was not a self-serve buffet. There were people at every station to plate the food for you and this made for long lines in a very small space. Also portion control was difficult- I received much larger helpings of some cold cuts than I wanted but when I got to the pasta I was given ONE SINGLE RAVIOLO. not ravioli. ONE SINGLE RAVIOLO. I asked for more... and was grudgingly given one more.\n\nAnd okay, now the food. The turkey (breast) was decent with some red wine reduction. The mashed potatoes were horrid and tasted like instant potato flakes. The cold meats and smoked salmon were fine. The caprese salad was BLAND BLAND BLAND and they didn't give me any damn basil. The apple and chestnut stuffing had an appalling texture and very little flavor; there was no regular stuffing. The ravioli (all two that I got to have) were forgettable. The desserts were the only thing I actually liked- there was a tasty chocolate mousse cake and tiramisu.\n\nOH! OH OH OH! For large parties, gratuity is automatic and as a result you will probably see a waiter once or twice throughout the evening, if that. We sat around for like 15 minutes waiting for someone to take our drink order. Instead, a waiter came over to tell us that we could go to the buffet whenever we wanted. We had to remind him that we might like something to drink, too. When the soft drinks did arrive, they were served in plastic Pepsi bottles like you'd get from a vending machine. WHAT?! At least it allowed us to refill our glasses on our own, because we would have gone thirsty otherwise considering how rarely we saw the waitstaff. When we did see them, they were largely unfriendly.\n\nFinally, there are musicians who walk around playing cheesy Italian-ish music. Like the theme from The Godfather, really. They come up to your table and play in your ear and it's super awkward.\n\nBasically- forgettable food and waiters that forget you exist. Forget this place and go somewhere else! You are in The Venetian; it's not like it's hard to find Italian food."

It no longer includes the complimentary champagne, but the buffet spread is to die for.  We are talking fresh quality food across the board.  I am a fan of Sterling Brunch, but if I had to choose between the 2 I would take Zeffirino's Holiday Brunch all day long.  \n\nThe Brunch is upstairs only, so you will be overlooking the Gondola Ride at the Venetian Canal.  Be sure to request a table overlooking it when you make your reservation.  There are a lot of choices for Mother's Day, but we all know if Mama isn't happy, nobody's happy.  Make sure to take her here for Mother's Day, and you won't regret it.\n\nHere is an interesting extra little tidbit for you - they have the most expensive restrooms in Vegas; it cost a couple million dollars if I remember right.

One of the most unique salads I have ever had!\n\nI had their take on lobster fra diavolo, which was not as spicy as I normally would like, but consisted of a 2 lb lobster, shrimp the size of small dogs, scallops as big as my fists and an assortment of mussels and clams.\n\nBy 6, the place started to fill up and as we were leaving, it was packed with a 90 minute wait.\n\nArrive early and don't freak when the automatic 15% gratuity hits your bank statement. It drops off after a few days unless you're a tightwad who doesn't believe in tipping."

As expected, it has Italian atmosphere and decoration.  Service is good and not over the top!\n\nI had Insalata Mista which is very good; it has some sweetness from dried baby strawberries and tang from Italian Balsamic dressing.

I say unforgettable, of course, because this is one of those atrocious restaurants that's so awful that you feel compelled to stand outside and steer people away.\n\nI knew we were in trouble from the moment we were led to the dining room past a big sign reading, \"NO PHOTOGRAPHY WITHOUT MANAGER'S APPROVAL.\" When you feel the need to post an authoritarian, unwelcoming sign banning people from taking pictures, you must have something to hide.\n\nThe blackshirts who posted the sign set a dour tone for the rest of the service. Our waiter was flippant and visibly disappointed when no one at our table of eight ordered any wine. We literally never saw him again.\n\nThere was no salt and pepper on the table, so I had to steal it off a waiter's cart. Our soft drinks were served in PLASTIC BOTTLES, which has got to be the tackiest thing I've ever seen at a restaurant. It's as if they ran out the back door and bought them at 7-11 when we ordered them.\n\nThe food was entirely forgettable. At the risk of sounding politically incorrect, a traditional Thanksgiving dinner at an Italian restaurant might not be the best idea, but my mother-in-law is mighty Italian and she has no problem cooking turkey, mashed potatoes and stuffing. Real stuffing, not some weird apple-ly goop.\n\nThe dessert station salvaged some of the experience, with a good selection of little cakes and pies, including a very creamy chocolate cream pie and mini tiramisu.\n\nMy dad and in-laws came thousands of miles to spend Thanksgiving with us. Tomorrow we're going to have to take them to Firefly to make up for this travesty.\n\nAt least we're all together...isn't that what Thanksgiving is about?\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that they have TWO things that NO restaurant should ever have: A bathroom attendant and a guy who comes to your table and plays music. No thanks!\n\nAPPENDAGE TO THE EDIT: I think they polish the silverware with Barkeeper's Friend. I know this because the napkins smelled exactly like it. Draw your own conclusions about that process."

Greeted by hostess with \"how many in your party?\", to which I responded \"four, but we have reservations\".    Reservations is apparently a foreign concept here as her response was \"ok, your name is on the list\".  Fine, it's Christmas morning, so beggars can't be choosers.  So I asked how long the wait is, she said 20 minutes, not bad.\n\nProceeded to the first floor bar, where we ordered bloody mary and coffee.  Knowing we were going to wait I asked whether it's possible to score some bread.  \nThe bartender, whom I will call \"cranky\" responded with \"sure sir, let me get your drinks and then I will leave these customers here to go upstairs and get you some bread\".  Well jolly Christmas to you too, cranky!\nLuckily she didn't end up having to leave her station as her slowness with the drinks meant we were called upstairs before she could bring them all out.\nAs we were ready to go upstairs cranky left a parting gift by instructing us to wait for all our drinks, as I'm sure it would have been a disaster for the restaurant if she or her colleagues were to leave their station to bring us the drinks upstairs.\n\nOur arrival at the 2nd floor was greeted by a life-size Pavarotti statue and another hostess who I will call 'clueless'.  Clueless asked us how many were in our party to which I responded, \"four, and we were just called upstairs\".\n\"OK sir\", clueless responded, please just wait in the waiting area until your name is called.  Lo and behold, there were at least another eight parties waiting for their tables (really, Open Table should cease to do business with this establishment as their practice is downright insult to the concept of reservations).\nAs other parties started giving up I kept inquiring clueless how long the wait is going to be, but clueless was being, well ... herself.\nAt some point, dizzy from the hunger, I went inside the dining area to see whether I could score some bread.  A lady who looked like the head hostess was kind enough to grab some for me and informed us that it wouldn't take much longer before we could be seated.\n\nOne hour after our reservation time we were at our table.  The dining area overlooks the grand canal of the Venetian shopping mall, Vegas at its best.\n\nChristmas brunch buffet consisted of high end selections such as lobsters, veal, oysters, cold cut meats, cheese, fish prepared in multiple ways.  Food was good, four stars.  \nUnfortunately the buffet was served by a row of miserable waiters.  I don't blame them, I'd be miserable too if I had to serve hungry, upset customers on Christmas day.  Hey, let me channel my inner Robert Irvine here: it's a Vegas buffet.  Would you consider letting your customers serve themselves?  \n\nOur waiter, Javier, was the sole reason why I rate this restaurant two stars.  He was friendly, attentive, and has a good sense of humor.  He was the only one I interacted who felt like he belonged there, in a high end establishment.  Five stars for him.\n\nPrice was ok, $85 per person including tax and tips.  Expected price for Vegas.\n\nOverall, unless you must have an Italian meal and you must have it at the Venetian shopping mall I suggest you go elsewhere.  The Las Vegas Boulevard has probably the greatest concentration of restaurants in all of America except for Manhattan.  Customers are blessed with choices here."

The grilled seabass was definitely the best way to go, comes with steamed broccoli and a nice piece of fish. The ragu on the ravioli looked just like that... Ragu. $17.00 for 4. Okay, but i'll pass. Had better at Trader Joe's.  \n\nIf you want good Italian, your better bet would be Maggiano's, the menu is more extensive and tasted better for the cost, but again, the location is definitley what you are paying for at Zeffirino."

The waiter recommended the Chilean sea bass with white wine and capers, which was an extremely bland, flavorless dish. Couldn't taste any wine or any of the three capers served on the fish.  I could only eat a small portion because it completely lacked flavor. It was served with spinach, which was not at all tasty, and I like spinach.  Also disappointing were our appetizers.  To start, we also ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was recommended by the waiter, which made no sense because the risotto dishes had the identical shrimp on top.  Also disappointing was the Caprese.  The tomatoes were tasteless, and the balsamic vinegar was poured on the serving dish with the caprese in such a small quantity that it was impossible to scoop up and put on your salad.  Finally, there was no basil on the dish.  Again, it lacked any flavor.  Very pricey meal for something that I did not enjoy.  Try the other Italian restaurants in the Venetian.

Downstairs is a lovely, dark bar, nice to enjoy a drink or two.  upstairs are the most awesome bathrooms (should have taken a pic!) and the restaurant.    We got a seat on the \"balcony\" over looking the gondolas and we could hear all the pretty singing.\n\nAs for the food... they had nice wine specials for $5 a glass, a merlot and pino grigio which were very good, especially for the price.  I have had much better Caesar salads.  My friend got the Chicken Parmesan and it was not very good... the dining facility at the Army hospital I work at actually makes MUCH better chicken parm than Zeffirino, and it is only $2 compared to $18.50.  Managers/cook of Zeffirino, if you are reading this, you need to change your recipe!  There is no excuse for bad chicken parm at an Italian restaurant!  \n\nOn the other hand, my pasta dish was absolutely delish!  (it was the special of the day).  It was green pasta ravioli stuffed with ricotta with a creamy mushroom and watercress sauce, with little slices of zucchini in it.  Yum.  What I would do for another plate of that.  Their bread basket was also very good, especially these crispy chip things that reminded me of phyllo dough... I couldn't stop eating them. (please see pics)\n\nSo, big minus stars for the crappy chicken parm and Caesar salad.  Big plus stars for the pasta and bread basket chip thingies and downstairs bar."

Maybe it's because I'm obsessed with all things Italian, but I seriously look forward to eating here every time I'm in Vegas. \nThe atmosphere in this place is incredible. The decor is so rich and romantic, and being able to overhear the gondoliers singing in the canal below really adds to the ambiance. \nBut my real love for Zefferino's stems from the fact that they have superb food. I'm fairly certain that I've never been served a single thing that I didn't absolutely love. Okay, that's not true, there was this one petit four that was kinda wonky, but other than that everything has always been stellar, from the pasta, to the desserts, to the wines. If you eat at Zefferino's and don't absolutely love it, you may need to see a doctor because there may be something wrong with your palate."

The Strip also rocks the wee hours, especially on the weekends, so there's plenty to do and see.  Fantastic!  What is absolutely NOT fantastic, however, is realizing at 11 P.M. that you haven't eaten dinner, and as a responsible Yelper and lover of snazzy food visiting one of the capitals of snazzy food, a street hot dog will not do.  Several heart-wrenching phone calls to various concierges later, the Venetian informs me that they still have three (gasp!) restaurants open, and to me, Zeffirino sounded the best, so they immediately added me to the books. \n\nAnd so it was that in a stroke of fate, my friend and I happened upon a really good restaurant in Vegas, and a very reasonably priced one ($100 for two people - entree for each, one drink, and an appetizer), which is great after reading Yelp reviews of other restaurants talking about dropping hundreds of dollars per person.  We were the last table seated, and they closed the kitchen before we got to dessert, but hey, that was all our fault - though it would have been nice to ask us if we wanted dessert during dinner, just in case.\n\nWe started with the sea bass cake on saffron sauce as an appetizer, which was good, not too fishy but nothing too snazzy.  I had the duck, and seriously, I have never been fed so much duck on a plate in my entire life, and I was definitely very pleased with the flavors and the preparation of the dish.  My Dining Buddy had the fettuccine with seafood, which was served in a good but non-threatening tomato sauce.  The wine menu was like a novel (seriously, it had a table of contents), but I selected a very tasty cocktail (Berry Lemonade) from an extensive list of delicious-sounding mixed drinks and martinis.  Aside from the drinks, the menu, though extensive, was nothing mind-blowing from what we sampled, but all was satisfying, tasty, and reliable, even for people who aren't crazy about Italian or seafood.\n\nEspecially given the late hour, the service was excellent, and our view of the waterway in the Venetian with the occasional serenading gondolier provided great atmosphere."

I wasn't impress with the quality of the food at all, but that might be because I was there for lunch and ordered the $25.99 lunch special with appetizer, entree, and dessert. My seafood salad was okay. I think they were right on with serving such a small portion because if I had ate anymore I might have thrown up. I ordered some beef cube thing for the entree and it just didn't taste like anything. It was as if the chef just sprinkled some salt on and piled on a side of string beans and called it a meal. I could've done better in the kitchen with the beef. As for the dessert? Well...let's just say I preferred the gourmet candy apples and gelato sold all over the Venetian and Palazzo hotel. I give this place three stars because although the food was just okay, the service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive but didn't hover. I just hate waiters that come by every 5 minutes asking how everything is going. I just really wanted to say \"it would be going better if you didn't talk to me while I'm chewing on my food.\" That's mean. I know.

That is not to say that it is poor by any means but at its price point and considering that it's in the Venetian, you should be expecting a lot more. \n\nPros: \n* $22 prix-fixe for lunch is a great deal \n* the pasta dishes in general are fine \n* the view of the Gondolas does lend itself to a romantic occasion\n* the musicians at the restaurant are very versatile and will perform songs in multiple languages \n\nCons: \n* the food is simply not spectacular  and is easily outclassed by nearby restaurants such as Valentino, Postrio, and B and even Canaletto\n* the prices are ridiculous. $28 for foie gras is more expensive than in top end steakhouse and only $2 cheaper than the infinitely classier Le Cirque; $20 cold cuts when you can get the exact same dish for 1/2 the price 5 minutes away at Enotecca Otto; $44 for a simple breaded veal dish that you can get for $20 in any neighboring Italian restaurant, etc....\n* exceedingly small portions at the limited dinner prix-fixe (it costs the same as a single entree for good reason) \n\nThere is better Italian to be found in the Venetian and in Vegas in general. The ambiance is pleasant and the musicians surprised me when they knew Croatian and Serbian folk songs but on the basis of food and service and especially value I simply cannot recommend Zefferino. An a la carte dinner with appetizer, desert, and a drink can easily cost $100, the same as the tasting menu at a great restaurant sage as SAGE or a fantastic steak dinner at any of the multitude of Sin City's red meat havens."

I think they think no one can hear them but it isnt the case. Their sea bass although drowned.in a sauce was decent. Tender n flakey and it had a good flavor. Their Salates station is decent as well however for the food that sticks to your bones F- ...

It was far away from the most popular eateries within the casino, but casual yet intimate enough to be one of the Venetian's most versatile. Good food, great ambiance, and almost always a good time.\n\nLots of visitors to the Venetian often balk at the fact there is no dedicated buffet on premises, but if there were one, it'd be here. It won't be the self-indulgent, competitive eater training course like many other spreads at nearby resorts, but a classier, simplistic array of Italian specialties that change on a near daily basis and is served by someone every time. Be sure to ask nicely if you want a good helping and know the Sunday brunch hour is probably the most recommended time to try it.\n\nBut their best execution has always been items from their nightly a la carte menu. Homemade ravioli of various fillings are no stranger to my plate and their other pasta options were filling and rich. One of their strengths was rolling with anything in the seafood realm. Whether it was a sea diver scallop appetizer or a crab ragu linguini or a lobster risotto, it would often taste as good as it looked. Prosciutto wrapped anything? Yes please.\n\nSome other tips for maximizing the experience:\n\n* Thinking of hosting a wedding reception here? Definitely a stellar choice.\n* Things to avoid on their menu: anything parm (especially chicken) and their steaks could use a little work.\n* You don't have to eat. Drink wine instead.\n* Service is usually super, but beware of the occasional waiter/waitress having a bad day.\n* Holiday buffets are nice, but avoid if you can - they're overpriced and incredibly overcrowded.\n* There will be live acts on occasion. Appreciate the musicians, they sing tons better than any of the touristy (and cheesy) gondola guys rowing across the canal. At least there's a decent view."

But the quality and presentation of the food was solid.\n\nOur meeting was in the 2nd floor VIP room, which was a little awkward for the 50+ people there who were supposed to be looking at one projected PowerPoint. I'd say this space might be better for more roundtable discussions than one speaker for this reason. At the same time, it was fun looking down at the mall from our Venetian restaurant and feeling like were were in some castle. (The decor is a little regal, in my opinion.)\n\nI really liked all the food we had. The Antipasto Mixto was presented well and included great bites of some traditional antipasti. The pafutelli pasta with pesto and filled with veal and cheese was delicious, though I couldn't taste the veal very much. Lastly, the branzino just melted in my mouth. I kind of wish there was a little more on the plate, but, as the only hero, they did it well."

It made me feel badly for the chefs who sent out good food.\n\nThe appetizer (and plates) were never cleared. Our wine glasses sat empty for over 20 minutes. I looked around for nearly 30 minutes for someone to bring some water after the appetizers were served, but no one ever stopped back at the table. The scant remains of the appetizer were never cleared before dinner. The server brought a spoon for the main course pasta and knife for veal, but he did not remove any of the clutter on the table nor did he offer another glass of wine as our glasses were empty. I finally went and asked for a manager. He cleared the clutter himself, was very nice and apologized.\n\nI believe the issue was there were so many \"levels\" of servers - one for water, one for bread, another to clear the tables, main server, etc - that no one wanted to do more than their job description. The main server should have noticed the lack of attention to the table by his lower staff and either done the job himself or jumped all over the other staff (whom he tips out) to do their jobs. \n\nI complained to a manager, but at that point we really just wanted to leave, not get another glass of wine. There are too many incredible competing restaurants (Carmine's is now open in Las Vegas, for example) for this level of service (at these prices) to be allowed. We enjoyed a night here last year, but we will never return. Don't waste a night for dinner here."

Even today after all the newer digs I still find this to be what it always tried to be.  A great place to have true Italian food.  The chef catered to the old Pope John guy and even Ol' Blue Eyes himself Frank Sinatra ate from his plates.  Take advantage of the brunch here.  It is a good experience.  The seafood platter used to be an event in itself.  I think it may have downsized on the amount of seafood recently but it is still a grand meal for the price.  Everything here is romantic and there are even serenades by a trio playing old world tunes that come to the tables.  I'd come back here for the total ambiance again or for a family members dinner."

Yes, bill was paid, thanks for realizing we exist.\n\nWe head upstairs with wine glasses and a bottle of wine where we were asked to wait... Again...\n\nFinally get seated.  Service got minimally better.  Not sure who our waiter was, went back and forth between people. After ordering and eating appetizers, asked the guy filling out water if we could order our entree.

Our order was taken a bit quickly and I felt we were being rushed.  I ordered wine for dinner and it was served quickly without any request for cocktail orders. The appetizers were delivered very fast, which confirmed my sense of being rushed. Then things started getting more positive. The food was delicious, calamari and zucchini cooked just right, fresh salads, excellent beef carpaccio, and fresh mozzarella tomato salad.  We actually had a decent interval between the appetizer and main course. The pink sauce and pesto sauce raviolis were as good as it gets. My wife loved her eggplant parmigiana. The dinner menu is quite nice. Then, three desserts were quickly served for the people that bought the dinner. But, again, we were being rushed as one of my guests wanted the fruit option and none of them were asked to choose before the dessert was served. Then we had to ask for coffees and a dessert menu for the rest of us. We were given one menu to share for three people. The restaurant is attractive and the table side live music was enjoyable.

Stopped in and got the ricotta filled ravioli with creamy pesto sauce.  It was amazing!  The Caesar salad was decent.\n\nAmbiance of the restaurant is low key and relaxing.  The restaurant seating is in the upstairs section after passing the bar so you are away from the passing crowds of people and all of the noise.  Great service, great food, and a pleasant atmosphere."

The service was exceptional! The Italian pinot grigio kept flowing. The waiters were readily available to answer questions and overall super attentive. \n\nThe appetizers: calamari, caprese salad and Affettato di Salumi Misti were all delicious. For the entree I had the homemade saffron pasta with lobster. I was a bit disappointed with the dish because the lobster was over cooked. The homemade pastas are all highly recommended. We pre-ordered a cake for the celebration and it was an Italian cake with strawberry mousse filling. \n\nI was very impressed by the service given that we had such a large party.

Overlooking the faux St.Marks, the decor in this restaurant is wonderful. Love the mosaics, the luxurious bathroom, and the tapestries on the wall. If only the food and service could live up to the ambience.\n\nThe bread service was okay - some pieces were dried out from being pre-cut for too long. The bread was served cold and with pads of butter which is an odd pairing considering you're at an Italian restaurant (balsamic and oil, please!)\n\nMy hubby and I ordered the caesar salad, the mixed fried calamari and zucchini, the chicken parm with linguine and the cheese ravioli alfredo with truffle oil.\n\nWhen the waiter wheeled out our food covered in cheap stainless steel domes from room service, I knew we were in trouble.\n\nThe lettuce in the caesar was wilted from sitting in the dressing for too long. It was too mayonaise-y and loaded with stale croutons. My husbands fried calamari and zucchini was not much better - greasy, soggy with a poor batter.\n\nI was surprised at how bad my chicken parmigiana was. The batter was not crispy at all while the breast meat was dry. I'm serious - I've had frozen chicken parm that was better. The linguine was okay but too heavy on the marinara.\n\nCheese ravioli was poor - the layer being too thick and the ricotta totally one note. It's very similar to the fresh pasta you can get from the supermarket. The pasta was swimming in the alfredo sauce which was okay but not fantastic (even with the truffle oil). Serving size is very small considering the cost of the entree (see the pics - four supermarket sized ravioli).\n\nDessert was served - a strawberry mousse with some sort of ?pistachio cake, a chocolate brownie, and a small fruit tart. None of these items are worth a return visit for.\n\nFinally, a word of warning. I ordered a Diet Pepsi along with my lunch. Later on in the meal, the waiter asked if I wanted a refill. Seeing as how my glass totally filled with ice and would contain maybe 50 cc. of soda, I agreed. He did not disclose that the refill would cost an additional $3, plus the soda did not arrive until dessert (he asked if I wanted a refill with the starters).\n\nSo due to the service issues and the lackluster level of cuisine, this place gets a 2 star rating."

There are two floors in the place - the ground floor which is dressed up as an oppulant old fashioned European bar, and an upstairs with dining rooms over looking the fake Grand Canal at the Venitian. \nFor appitizers we had shrimp cocktail of a sort, and fried calimari. Both were good but not great. The mixed drinks were okay too, but not great.\n\nWhat makes this place 4 stars for me is the ambience, the decor, the good menu, and the fact that it has both a happy hour and early bird specials. In a town that can now cost many hundreds of dollars a day fro two people to eat and drink (this ain't the old Vegas), the specials as Zeffirino allows a couple to eat their fill of fun, decent Italian food while soaking up all of the faux charm of the hotel's fake atmosphere.\n\nThat way you can get drunk cheap and drop the money that you saved onto the tables. I mean, who ever looked at a one hundred dollar veal chop and said \"oh, I hope you make me a millionaire\". \n\nWishing for wealth at the slot machines is almost worth skipping the chop and grabbing a plate of inexpensive pasta at Zeffirino's.\n\nJust saying."

Not to be rude but if your complaining about the food your probably used to eating processed meals....if your complaining about the service/prices....your probably one of the drunks that gambled all there money away and have 10 bucks left to spare (lol a little harsh but just saying). ....oh yeah lobster how could i forget about the lobster.....i can go on and on about this place but to sum it up\n\n\nGREAT FOOD\nGREAT SERVICE\nGREAT ATMOSPHERE (PIANIST ON WEEKENDS)\nGREAT TIME.\nIF YOUR LOOKING FOR GREAT ITALIAN FOOD\nITS HERE."

Were a little bit afraid to go in, but were happy afterwards :)\nWe got the linguini alfredo which was delicious and creamy. I had angel hair with tomatoes, garlic and some herbs. Very good.\nThe red wine (chianti) gets a 10 ! \nWe shared the tiramisu ... OMG... mmmmmmm we want more - we want more...!\nA pre calculated tip, but because the food was excellent and the waiters were friendly, we had no problem with it.\nIt's a pity that we discovered this resto not earlier.\nWill recommend and will return."

            "review": "Oh how completely disappointing to find Italian cuisine of this quality at such a grand Venetian themed hotel.  It is tough to find a bad meal in Las Vegas, but here it is.  A large winding dark and quite restaurant that impossibly feels dead, in the midst of all of the hubbub downstairs along the canal.  I love porcini mushrooms, so when we saw the Lasagna with redporcini's we decided to give it a try.  They explained that it was not a traditional lasagna, but what they brought to the table was lasagna like noodles with plenty of redporcini's, but it had no porcini aroma nor taste.  Maybe a RED porcini is like their lasagna and not a real porcini?  $30 for lasagna noodles and mushrooms and that is it.  Seriously, just an awful dish of nothing.  My date ordered off the menu to get pesto with spaghetti, but it was underwhelming in every way.    \n\nI applaud their large selection of wines by the half bottle.  I love that size for two people, yet so few vineyards produce them.  We had an Italian Chianti that fit the experience perfectly.  Off, boring and I wish I never had it."

            "review": "This place is a great respite from the buffet lines and huge steaks served at the many high end joints on the strip.\nThe standard menu was on the pricey side, but they were offering a prix fixe option for about $45 that the four of us decided to try.\n\nOnce we made our way upstairs, we were presented with menus, but no mention was made of the $45 option and the leaflet was nowhere to be seen.  When we inquired, the waiter sighed and brought it out.  I guess they think you will forget about it, as you make the trek upstairs to the dining room.\n\nThe portions we were served were a bit on the small side, but for the price it seemed fair.  Well my portion of the beef was the smallest of the three ordered, but I could use a little cutting back from time to time.\nThe soup (squash, i think) was ok, but everyone else raved about their salads and the mozzarella tomato salad.\n\nWe also ordered a side of broccoli, which I guess threw them for a loop, as our entrees were served and the side was not.  We reminded them, but by the time it was prepared, we were basically done with the entrees.  I did mention that the portions are small, so five bites of the beef and it was gone.\n\nDesert are basically some petit fours with coffee, which again is not going to fill you up, but were very good.\n\nOverall, the food here was very good, even though the prix fixe meal will not fill you up if you are hungry and/or skipped lunch.\n\nAbout a 3-4 star place, I went with 4 for the price and ambiance of the place."

I took no notice to what we ordered, but I know our bill went well over 800 bucks.  My dad and his wife were big drinkers that night.  My dad recommended I try some sort of seafood dish, that I truly cannot remember the name of right now.  I think it was swordfish with lobster sauce, but I'm sure it had a fancier name.  That was spectacular, and it was the whole reason that I took my boyfriend here again a year and a half later.\n\nWhen we came in last summer (on my second visit), service was just as excellent as I remembered, and everything else was too.  I ordered the same dish and was completely happily.  I can't say the same for my boyfriend, unfortunately.  He chose some sort of pasta dish, even though he wanted to order the same thing I ordered.  He really didn't like it. :(  I thought it was decent, but nothing you couldn't get for a lot of cheaper somewhere else.  However, everything else we ordered here was excellent, and like I said, service was fantastic.\n\nJust... don't order pasta!!!"

            "review": "Zeffirino claims to be a quintessential Venetian restaurant.  In reality, it is a quintessential Las Vegas restaurant, which happens to be located at the Venetian Hotel.  Zeffirino is so concerned with maintaining it's fake upscale, fake Italian image, that it almost forgets to pay attention to the food.  Yep, you heard me: the food is an afterthought here.  If you don't believe me, check out their website, which is dedicated to the decor more than the menu.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the decor here is top notch.  Second floor dining with giant balcony windows, overlooking the hustle and bustle of the Grand Canal is very impressive.  The restaurant affords amazing people watching opportunities.  What could be better than watching hordes of beautifully dressed men and women parade on the \"street\" below you?  Before you even get to the second floor, you find yourself in a giant library on the first floor.  Antique furniture, a piano, vases - the place looks and smells like Ron Burgundy's apartment in Anchorman.  By the time you get to the second floor, you expect to have a dining experience of your life.\n\nOur waiters definitely valued form over substance as well.  Clad in tuxedos and looking very refined, they evoked feelings of reverence and respect.  Sadly, I may have overestimated them.  I realize I was in Las Vegas and not particularly dressed up, but it was no excuse for snooty attitude and mild ambivalence.  I have a piece of advice for Mr. Waiter at Zeffirino's: don't just assume, OK?  I'll put up my food knowledge against yours any time, any day.  Your attitude was insulting and uncalled for, as was your inability to read people.  If you really had been a waiter for that long, you would have been able to recognize a knowledgeable customer. \n\nNow, on to the meal itself.  We had a $39 four-course prix fixe menu, which is what brought us out to Zeffirino in the first place.  As is the case in many restaurants, I had to ask for the prix fixe, since it wasn't brought out to us.  They did bring us bread, olive oil and olive spread, all of which we really enjoyed.  We asked for \"more bread and more spread\" a couple of times, and the busboy promptly brought it for us.\n\nI started with a Caesar salad which wasn't exciting.  Perhaps, it's my fault for ordering a boring salad, but it definitely wasn't my fault said salad was really bland.  The second course was standard, a plate of ravioli.  The ravioli was prepared al dente, and was easily the best part of the entire meal.  My third course, chicken parmigiana, was pretty bland and very forgettable.  I swear, I've had better dishes at the Olive Garden.  Finally, the dessert course consisted of unlimited coffee or tea, as well as 3 tiny (size of a postage stamp) pieces of tiramisu, cheesecake and carrot cake.  As was the case with each of the courses, the presentation was great, but the food was barely aspiring to mediocrity. \n\nThat said, any restaurant in Las Vegas that has a $39 prix fixe, welcomes walk-ins at 8 pm on a Saturday night, and gives you a table overlooking the upscale mall deserves at least 3 stars.  The next time I am hungry and reservation-less in Sin City, I might end up at Zeffirino again."

I think it used to be better.  My first experience here about ten years ago was very memorable.  My second experience two years ago was fair.  I had tried their Osso Bucco and seafood pastas, all of which were good.  My most recent experience this year was not mesmerizing.  The veal scaloppine was tough and the prosciutto wrapped around it was salty.  The pasta with meat sauce was dry but the meat was good.  I enjoyed the CA Pinot Noir.  Let's just say that I won't trip anyone to make my way here on my next LV visit but will give it another try if passing by and find myself without an abundance of options.  Nice ambiance and seating at an earshot of the gondoliers."

The lines for the food were long at times but overall were manageable.  The service that day was excellent.  You can tell the management and brought in extra staff and the service could not have been better.  Made a special request to sit by a window and the request was granted without a problem.  If the food was seasoned better I would have given this meal a 4."

I have been here before and vowed to return when I could afford this gem of a restaurant again. \n\nFrom the moment you walk in, it's classic Italian in every sense. Beautiful decor, dark wood, great Italian music, beautiful seafood displayed at the bar and REAL Italians speaking Italian. \n\nWe make our way upstairs where the dining room is and were sat promptly. Everyone was so nice and inviting. AND did I say all Italian? No kidding! There were 3 guys playing music table side which was a nice touch but I never know if I should look at them or what. It's kind of weird. \n\nAnyway, on to the dinner- I opted for a special dinner they had for $44 (I think this is a new thing since our economy is in the $#@^*(! ). It included an appetizer or salad or soup, entree, dessert and coffee. Not bad! I got the Caesar salad, heavy on the anchovy paste please. Love it! Hubby and I split the calamari and zucchini. Perfectly crisp, not greasy. A cocktail sauce and a creamy sauce were served with it. Perfect compliment. \n\nFor entree I had the fotina cheese ravioli in a vodka sauce. Perfection! The pasta and sauces are made fresh and it's evident in every bite. Hubby got the veal. Juicy, crispy, just perfection! For dessert they gave me a plate of little baby cakes/pies. It was great to have a nibble of something sweet, anything more and I would have been in a food coma. \n\nThe bathrooms have your VERY OWN SINK inside the stall and mouthwash. They thought of everything! I highly recommend this place if you win a jackpot or have a corporate dinner or you are really rich. Really, it's worth every penny if you can afford it."

What a perfect place to go to with a bunch of girls surrounded by cute servers and bus boys! \n\nThe menu is in Italian with English descriptions of the meals. You really have to take your time to read it (unless of course you can read and understand Italian). The portion sizes are large enough for sharing which is perfect for keeping a high cost meal on the cheaper side.\n\nThe whole experience and food was great but if I'm back in Vegas, and craving Italian, I'll explore my options a lot more."

I had the shrimp risotto ($34)  - the shrimp were especially well seasoned and cooked. Portion was good, but I wasn't really hungry either. So as good as the food is, it's more the location and ambiance that make this place special. \nOh, and the bathrooms were very nice - not sure that's important to anyone, but they were exceptionally neat. :) Every stall has its own sink."
