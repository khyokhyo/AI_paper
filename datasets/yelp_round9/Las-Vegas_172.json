            "review": "I don't know if it's our bad luck, but Loren F and I keep going to these hyped up places and get let down by the just ok food. \n\nMax Brenner is located inside the Forum Shops and is known for their dessert menu, but also offers a variety of American fare. We came during happy hour (M-F 3-6 and 9-close.) So maybe that's partially our fault for only trying a fraction of the menu. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the food:\n\nMojito\n$6 for happy hour drink inside a casino is a steal. Drank 2 of them since I was thirsty, but then again I never have just one drink during happy hour. Good amount of mint and lime, way too much syrup. I had to try and squeeze out as much lime juice as I could so I wouldn't be drinking diabetes. \n\nBrenner sliders\nEh. Also $6 for happy hour. Came with 2 mini sliders and about 5 waffle cut fries. Completely underwhelmed by the taste. It's a burger that could be found at a normal place like PTs. Nice presentation though. \n\nChocolate chip walnut cookie\nPretty massive cookie. Came with a side of whip cream, strawberries and a mini glass of chocolate syrup (which I wanted to put in my purse BTW.) Cookie was full of chocolate and walnuts, but again nothing that would knock my socks off. I dropped part of it on the floor as I was cutting it and my response to that was \"there's goes $4 on the ground.\" It was only a small piece, but just the concept of dropping such an expensive cookie on the ground just ruffles my feathers. \n\nAll in all, I came for the experience of just trying new places. Don't know if I'll be back, but it was fun. \n\nTip: to any tourist reading this, just because you are from out of town does not mean you can act like a jack a$$. Please say excuse me if we accidentally bump into each other while walking and abide by the laws of driving. You still have to stop at a stop sign!!!!!!!!!!!"

            "review": "Chocolate is the Chuck Norris of sweets. It is possibly the tastiest substance ever created by mankind. Sure, chocolate can cure hunger, but it can also be paired with any food, stop wars, and, in many cultures, is part of mating rituals. Chocolate is like sweet edible sex.\n\nIf you're still reading, you can stop now cause ... ya, I know ... \"I had you at chocolate.\"\n\nNo sane person could turn down chocolate if offered. When my wife proposed going to Max Brenner at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace for dessert, she knew from my drool that I was no fool.\n\nWe were greeted at our table by a hyper server. Dude was clearly choco-rushin' and bouncin' off the walls. I loved his energy, but never did quite figure out what he was recommending. Does it matter? Chocolate is a synonym for \"yum.\"\n\nThe Chocolate Fondue and Choctails were tempting (of course); however, we opted for Max's Fried Dough ($14.25). This sweet icon is one huge thin crispy plate of Fried Dough drizzled with Chocolate Chunks, Toffee, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Milk Chocolate Ganache. The animated server said there was no way the two of us could finish it ... I laughed and dove in with both hands. He knows this is chocolate, right? It's a messy and filling dessert designed for a whole family to share...or not share. (4 stars)\n\nWe also split a Chocolate Hazelnut Milkshake ($7.95) with Vanilla Ice Cream, Milk Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Milk, and Whipped Cream. The shake was smooth, sweet, & superior. If Vincent in Pulp Fiction was surprised by a $5 milkshake imagine how he'd react to an $8 shake. Who needs vodka? It's got CHOCOLATE. I don't know if it's worth $8, but it's pretty f-in good! (4 stars)\n\nMax Brenner, I don't know who you are, but I do love chocolate. So, yep, I'm a sucker ... and a fan ... cause there are only two kinds of people in this world, those who love chocolate ... and those who love chocolate, but won't admit it."

            "review": "I went to Max Brenner on Christmas Eve after reading about this restaurant on Yelp and being instantly intrigued. I had come by the day before to buy cookies from the stand outside of the restaurant. The cookies (chocolate chip with nuts) are amazing! They are pricey at $5 each but they are large and heavy! I was shocked at how big they were. So we decided to come back the next night for dessert before going out to have drinks.\n\nWe got the fondue for two which was, I believe $21.95. With the fondue we got strawberries, bananas, marshmallows and what looked like store bought brownies, caramel and two types of chocoloate (we got milk and white). The fondue flame was a bit out of control! It was sparking a lot and actually made me a bit nervous that something would catch on fire. I was even more nervous after our server told us that a previous diner's Louis Vuitton bag caught fire a bit after a spark landed on a napkin then landed on her bag! I was like \"Umm, you can take it away now!\". Although I laugh/laughed about it, it could be dangerous though so you definetly need to pay attention. \n\nI felt that the fondue overall was kinda of basic and not that elaborate or special. It's easy to just cut up some fruit, get a few marshamllows and some Little Debbie brownies and put them in a bowl and melt some chocolate. I was expecting it to be a little more elaborate or to have a wow-factor. The overall experience of eating fondue and laughing about the out on control flame was fun and that did over-ride the lackluster service and fondue.\n\nI would probably only go back for the cookies."

            "review": "Killing time in the Forum Shops, I stopped in to Max Brenner to see what gifts I could pick up.  I was given a sample of this chocolate covered pistachio/almond/nut and it was DEE-LICIOUS. The chocolates are expensive but sooo good!   I liked the ambiance much more than the Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio (though their chocolates are amazing too!) \n\nI returned the next day for a light snack, sharing a juicy barbecue chicken slider (2 comes in an order) and the to-die-for waffle fries with chili cocoa powder.   I wished I had more time (and more room in my tummy instead of filling it up with peach bellinis at Fat Tuesday) to try more of their desserts!  They even sell a chocolate syringe to satisfy your cravings with shots of chocolate. I will definitely return and take time to enjoy their desserts first."

            "review": "I had been to the Max Brenner's in NYC but not Vegas. We went for their happy hour deal, it's from 9 to close and I believe also 4-7 or some other earlier time. Best deal ever - everything is $6, though you must sit at the bar. I got chicken tenders w/ fries and BBQ sauce and my friend got the buffalo chicken sliders. We got this insanely good dessert, it was like smushed Smores or something in a small pot and it was DELICIOUS. Came with bananas and also melted chocolate to drizzle over it ... I'm guessing it's like $9-10 when not happy hour.\n\nI would definitely try Max Brenner's out again next time I'm in Vegas (or in NYC)."

While I usually dislike chocolate, I couldn't help but put a smile on my face when I arrived. \n\nThe peeps were trying to find a sweet spot to ease their craving for sugary snacks, so we stopped by Max Brenner in passing. \n\nGreat atmosphere, almost as if you're transported to the days of red rover and four square. Awww....to be a kid again. \n\nSo step right up....for amazing chocolaty goodness that converted a non-chocolate loving person to a chocolate whore when she wandered in here! \n\nNo seriously, this place serves up sinful desserts to share, the perfect spot for a late night sweet!"

            "review": "Came to this place for lunch and were pleasantly surprised. We came with full expectation to try as many things as humanly possible. I had the Brenner burger (it was average) and my husband had the Cubano waffle sandwich (he reported it was tasty). The fries were uber tasty. We then got the classic European fondue for two and an Italian hot chocolate. I just loved the hot chocolate - it was so rich and creamy. I'm drooling right now. My husband liked the fondue more so. It came with two choices of chocolate (we did dark and milk) and caramel sauce. Dipping items included a chocolate chip cookie, brownies, bananas, strawberries and marshmallows (along with a little burner to toast them on!). The milk chocolate was way too sweet for me, but I think it helped me self diagnose a possible cavity (ouch!). The dark chocolate was really tasty and overall our favorite fondue sauce. \n\nService was pretty good - there was a moment or two we wondered where our server was but overall he kept up with refills and bringing things out quickly. \n\nThis is one of those places to come in LV if you are looking for a unique yet casual dining experience. We will make this one of our go-to spots to stop in for a quick bite!"

We had the fondue and split it between 3 and was satisfied. I can't wait to return or better yet..... have one open here in DC!!! I asked the GM if we'd ever see one.... no commitment but their other two restaurants are doing very well."

            "review": "Didn't know what to expect coming here but was impressed. My impression from the outside was that everything would be absolutely and sickeningly made out of chocolate-but I had to see for myself. \n\nIronically, I had nothing that contained chocolate-although there might have been some in the espresso, not too sure though. I started with an orange smoothie which was nice and cinnamony but I am not a fan of the metal straw, steel apparently is not too tasty. I had the huevos rancheros burrito which was awesomelicious. It came with nice crispy tater tots and the burrito was spiced well.\n\nMax has nailed all aspects of a good restaurant, food, reasonable prices, and great service as well as an attractive setting. The tables are tiny though - barely fit the platter of delicious-ness."

            "review": "If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would.  I have eaten at the Max Brenner in Tel Aviv many times. It's always been delicious and a great fun place to eat.  I am a local Las Vegas person and I will never come back here.  We were led to our table.  The chair I almost sat on was FILTHY!  Ok, switch chairs.   It took 15 minutes for us just to place a drink order. And when the order was taken,  the server, Danielle, was rushed and indifferent. She also kept calling us \"guys\" and that was annoying.   I ordered the salmon. It was as dry and as stiff as my Nike sneaker.  When the table was cleared, she noticed that I only ate one or two bites of my salmon.  She asked how it was. Seriously?  She needs to learn plate cues.  See my reviews of Hank's Steakhouse.  Anywho, I told her it was terrible. She told me she would take it off the bill.  Really? She took an order, which I didn't eat, off the bill?  How generous!!!!  She gave us the bill and didn't even offer to give us a dessert...nothing just okay and goodbye.  So, my three kids and I went over to the Cheesecake Factory and had a fantastic dessert with great service.  \n\nSo if you want a sneaker for dinner with lousy service go to Max Brenner.  Although, I understand this restaurant is closing in April.  I can see why....."

            "review": "We went for a Saturday brunch.  I'm always looking for new places to brunch, and this one excited me.  Brunch AND chocolate?  What could be better?\n\nAmbiance:  This place felt like an old English pub.  Very dark, with lots of wood.  It was cozy, but the chairs were not the most comfortable, especially the ones with arms.  If you are anything bigger than a size 12 or 14, you might want to opt for one of the armless chairs for a more comfortable dining experience.\n\nService:  Very nice and prompt.  Nothing special, but nothing to complain about.\n\nFood.  YUMMY!!!!!   But WAY overpriced.  We started with mocha lattes, which was one of the best I'd ever had - rich and creamy and just total perfection.  But a very small portion for the $8 pricetag.  \n  \nThen we shared the Well Mannered Omelet ($14 I think)- and it too was delicious perfection.  There was so much goat cheese oozing from the omelet, and the side of potatoes were spiced just right.  It also came with a sugar dusted biscuit and chocolate dipping sauce...mmmmm.  So good.\n\nWe also shared the Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes, and ate every fabulous bite. However, $15 for pancakes is just too much to spend, even being as delicious as they were.\n\nMy friend got the Max Brenner burger. (about $15 I think) She had ordered it medium rare and it came out medium well, but they quickly fixed it for her.  I didn't try the burger, but I did have several of her chocolate dusted waffle fries.  YUM YUM!  Who'd have thought....fries and chocolate?\n\nOverall, I would have rated it higher except that it was just too overpriced.  I guess I should have anticipated that given there were no prices on the restaurant website. And I suppose it is par for the course for a restaurant on the Strip.  I might return one day for a special occasion, or just to share a chocolate dessert with some friends, but I definitely won't be a regular."

The plating and presentation is creative, unique, and \"cute\" \n\nWe did appetizers.. and all had bacon in them. Bacon is not my fave, but I was just going along with it. We had the \"best macaroni and cheese,\" chicken skewers, and another got a BLAT: bacon, lettuce, avocado, tomato. \n\nI don't think this was the best macaroni and cheese, or whichever that was called. Yes, it was good, yes it was cheesy, gooey, creamy... but maybe I am biased because of the bacon that was spread throughout. \n\nChicken skewers were tasty. Placed on toothpicks and wrapped in bacon, with a dipping sauce that I didn't focus on enough to distinguish. \n\nAs for the dessert, which i will be back for next time... Screw the food!! \nI think the milkshakes are incredible and have a little Alice in Wonderland story to go along with them.. I have never had a milk shake like that before, this is a must get! \n\nWe also shared a fondue with dark chocolate, caramel, and milk chocolate. The fondues came with brownies, choc chip cookies, marshmallows, strawberries, and bananas. Also, a little grill for roastin and toastin! \n\nThis is a fun place to come as a group. I also noticed a side bar for to-go orders. So, if you want to enjoy while walking through the shops, or the strip... grab a milkshake to-go!"

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was one of my favorite books and movie as a kid and this reminded me of it.  The chocolate martinis were good.  The churros were good but they were very thin and crunchy and I prefer fried dough that is on the softer side.  The white chocolate dipping sauce was very sweet.  The mini burgers were good but the chocolate pizza was very dry.   The only reason for four instead of five stars: because the ladies restroom was quite messy with toilet paper strewn on the floor on both of my visits."

So, in my moment of disappointment, I listened to the waiter's suggestion and opted for the Hazelnut milkshake instead. Omgahhhhhhhh so good. It's like melted Nutella that's been chilled to milkshake form. \n\nSide note: I probably should've shared my shake because it was so thick, rich, and yummy that I couldn't even finish half by myself.

It's pretty incredible.My boyfriend ordered the pillow steak panini. \n\n I am a bit of a mac and cheese snob, where my boyfriend swears by Kraft. When my order came out he was all over it. His pillow panini was delicious as well, the meat cooked perfectly and the waffles fries went amazing with the aoli sauce that it came with. His only complaint was that the bread was a bit thick (hence pillow) and it was crispy all the way through, where he though pillow meant crunchy outside and soft on the inside.\n\nThe mac and cheese was perfection! Creamy enough, crunchy a bit because of the bread crumbs and the bacon bits were the perfect touch! It also comes with a marinara sauce on the side, which I've never thought to put with mac and cheese but it was the perfect combination. It was having two types of pasta in one dish!\n\nThe second time we were here, we came just for dessert (we were too full the first time). We came with five people total and ordered three things. The fondue for two, the chocolate heart cake and shake, and the churros. The fondue for two was the perfect amount of everything, we had the milk chocolate option, it came with super moist banana nut bread, fried bananas, strawberries, ice cream, chocolate wafers, regular bananas and marshmallows. The finishing touch was the open flame that you got to roast your marshmallows over. \n\nThe churros were awesome as well. You could definitely tell that the churros were made in house, it came with caramel sauce, milk chocolate sauce AND raspberry sauce.\n\nLastly was the heart cake and shake. This is where the minus star comes from. The cake was a lava cake of sorts, but it was incredibly dry. We each had a bite, and we just pretty much left the rest. The shake was super cute and perfect for one person to take a sip from. The best part was the chocolate sauce that was in the shake. It's meant to be used over the cake, but we ended up using it on just about everything! \n\nOverall we were chocolate wasted and needed naps after everything!"

I think Max Brenner has good food but it is not great.\n\nI had the Mexican omlette, a pizza made with mozerella cheese, a dark hot chocolate. The Mexican omlette was nothing special and the egg was over cooked, the pizza was the only thing I really liked and the hot chocolate was way too sweet even though I requested steamed milk to dilute it a bit. I think I actually ruined my hot chocolate by adding milk. The first few sips were heaven but it eventually got too sweet where I didnt want to eat my main course. I suggest you save the hot cocoa for dessert.\n\nThe customer service was impeccable. We were served by a friendly staff that checked on us every few minutes and were happy to cater to our every need even though we asked for numerous little things like steamed milk, moving to another table, extra utencils and plates, etc."

            "review": "This review is on the thick Italian sipping chocolate.  I have never eaten here however I have been here many times in the winter months for the sipping chocolate (please DO NOT mistake for hot chocolate) After my boyfriend being to Spain he told me about this kind of drink this is not quite the same but as close as he has found here in the US.  If you're wondering what it's like in Spain it is like a chocolate bar melted with a crispy sweet bread if you put it in it would stand on end.  This is ever so slightly more liquid but OMG good!  Pretty much a milk chocolate, if that is you choice bar melted down with milk added and put in a cup warm.\n\nYou don't need much at all.  The way it used to work was they had a little kioskey thing out front to just order and go.  They must have wanted to up the value of the property so that is now gone for tables for dinner.  You now have to go into the bar and order, this wouldn't be a bad thing but the bartenders are truly unpleasant.  I mean if you hate your job that much and you pouring a cup of chocolate into a cup for me and getting a tip for your unpleasantries and inconvenience is such a problem then please find a new job!  I hate the new layout and consider not ever coming back but sadly I like chocolate and I like it a lot in small portions so I will come back.\n\nAgain this review is not for food it is for sipping chocolate and sipping chocolate service.  If you do go in get the sipping chocolate not hot chocolate it is a thicker more amazing version if you get hot chocolate it is just that and at this place it is over priced and not that great!  If you go with my recommendation it is a pay per oz kinda thing.  You do NOT need a full 6oz cup please learn from my mistakes of the past 3oz is great sometimes 1oz is fine but just not quite enough.\n\nIf it wasn't for the crapy, crabby service this would have been 5 stars for the chocolate  by the way this is not the first time to go into the bar and get crabby service, they really need to retrain and rehire the bar staff..."

This alone is worth 5 stars and was the best chocolatey alcoholic beverage I've ever had,  maybe the best drink I've ever had period-but you have to love chocolate and sweet (helllooo, don't go here  if that ain't you). Service was great, despite other yelp reviews, maybe because it wasn't that crowded. Come for happy hour  (3pm-6pm) for 6 dollar drinks and appetizers. Corn croquettes were excellent, sliders were very good and mini sloppy Max (pulled pork) were good. Not as memorable were the intoxi-cake martini, the banana fondue (fondue sauces were great but hot mushy bananas, not so much), and cocoa and chili dusted fries (they were pretty average but could not taste the cocoa). They even have a mini gift shop if u can't get enough of their chocolate....but be careful, if you're driving back to So.Cal., it may disappear before you arrive."

(too much?..OOOHHHH well.)\n\nSo here I am, reminiscing my trip to L.V..then all of a sudden my taste buds are savoring the chocolaty tastiness of Max Brenner. Which is the reason of me writing a review on it. I went with 3 other people, let's just say we're all very critical and precise when it comes to food.\n\nThe wait, was..okay the wait was friggin' forever. Prolly 40 minutes or so. HEY I'M NOT A PANSY, I WAS REALLY IMPATIENT AT THE MOMENT OKAY??! Anyways.. they finally called us over..me and my stupid self galloped over to the table gazing at the beautiful bald chocolate man's animated face..I..I mean the menu. \n\nUhh just to confirm when you go there..make sure to order something involving CHOCOLATE. Oh god, most of the people that were surrounding us ordered sandwiches..I mean REALLY?! Sup with that?! We ordered the Classic European Chocolate Fondue, which is enough for two, but we've never tried it, nor know the portion size, so we decided to just order one. I'm not going to create a huge hype for the fondue, since they only served huge sticky mouth watering marshmellows, fresh strawberries and bananas..with thick, sweet, sugary, plentiful white chocolate, milk/dark chocolate..sounds aight? Well it SURE AS HELL WAS! The whole setting was enjoying for us, definitely comin' back for some fondue swag. For the drinks, we ordered a couple o' Mexican Spicy Hot chocolates, and Melting Marshmellow Hot Chocolates. Overall, they were okay. Sweet, and chocolaty, basically. \n\nWhen it comes to the way the place looks, it is pretty relaxing. Nice lighting, ambiance, waiters, smell..oh the smell. Honestly, you will have a nice time, even if the food wouldn't be as good as you thought. Even the bathrooms are stunning. Wow, I'm such a loser. Anyways, if your liddo curious mind is wondering if you should go hurrr, GET TO IT!"

For dessert, I got a large peanut butter sundae that was great, but still a little pricey at $15.  People who go to Max Brenner don't go for the food, but it won't make you regret going.

The spicy waffle fries were cooked perfectly. The chicken panini was nice and juicy and not smashed like most paninis I'm used to. The spicy chicken and cheese pizza was very big and could easily feed two, maybe three people (the goat cheese was a nice touch). The caramel concoction dessert was very nice (since we're Indian we love spice anywhere we can get it and here, the combination of mousse, white chocolate and spicy peanuts was memorable).\n- Quantity of food: The burgers are HUGE and while you dont get a large side of fries, you get enough to fill yourself up. The panini was hearty and the pizza was large also. Comfort food indeed!\n-Service: Fast and friendly!\n\nThe bad:\n- The cheese croquettes. For $7 you get four measly quarter-size croquettes. They were tasty (panko crumbs) but incredibly over-priced (shocking because everything else seemed reasonable).\n\nConclusion: Would definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas!"

            "review": "This is one of my favorite restaurants in town because even after 5+ visits,  I'm always craving another meal! The food is amazing. I know it's a sweet spot (pun intended), however, I've only had dessert once (we're always much too full from our meals). That doesn't mean you don't consume chocolate though - he is the \"Chocolate Man\" after all. Seating is available in their \"outdoor\" area, inside (surrounded by the bar and shop), or upstairs. All the seating is enjoyable with the upstairs dining area to be the most desirable (spacious and a bit more private).\n\nMy favorite items from \"Things to Dip\" are The Smoky Dry Rubbed Chicken Wings ($12.25) with creamy bleu cheese sauce, Waffle Fries dusted with Chili and Cocoa Powder ($6.95), and Black & Tan Beer-Battered Vidalia Onion Rings ($6.95) with dark chocolate ranch. Really, really, really delicious! The onion rings didn't produce the same fireworks as the other two dishes, however, that dark chocolate ranch is seriously amazing. Can I get that with everything?\n\n\"For Your Hands\" choices, The Brenner Burger ($14.25) with Max's secret BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomato, cheddar, and vidalia onion ring and The Best B.A.L.T. ($14.75) with crispy bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and cilantro-avocado mayo, are both amazing. Same goes for their \"Perfect Paninis\" - the Grilled Chicken ($14.75) is made with goat cheese, spinach, tomato, and black olive pesto and the \"Margherita\" ($14.50) has oven-roasted tomatoes, basil, fresh mozzarella, and a tomato-basil aioli. They all come with the addictive chili and cocoa powder dusted waffle fries. Drool.\n\n\"Max's Flatbread Pizzas\" are also really good and great to share. The \"Meaty, Cheesy, Crusty, etc\" Pizza (no longer on the menu) had Italian sausage, pepperoni, peppers, and crispy basil. I've also had the Ricotta & Mushroom Pizza ($13.25) with black olives and sun-dried tomato pesto.\n\nThe Really-Cheesy Really-Crunchy Mac & Cheese ($15.75) made with a special 5-cheese blend, tomatoes, and smoked applewood bacon on the \"With a Knife and Fork\" menu is crazy good. I'm not even \"Mac & Cheese\" person and I would never have ordered this dish (thank goodness for Ruben), but wow. I couldn't stop eating it. The Sunday Mood Pasta ($15.75) with fresh tomatoes, spinach, ricotta, and tomato-pesto sauce is also, as you can guess, delicious.\n\nI've only been here for \"Max's Brunch Therapy\" once and I had the Hang-Over Omelet ($13.25) that came with a scrumptious diamond-dusted sugar buttermilk biscuit, spiced home fries (YUUUM), and pure melted chocolate (YEAH). You would only raise an eyebrow when you read chocolate with an omelet until you've actually had it. See, you don't need to order dessert.\n\nBut, of course the desserts are amazing. I had their popular \"The Fantastic Popsicle Fondue\" that comes with vanilla ice cream popsicles that you dip into pure melted chocolate, Choco-pops (love these things!) and candied hazelnut crunchy bits ($8.50 for one, $14.50 for two). Interactive, fun, and tasty.\n\nI could go on and on about the food (I already did), but if you need guidance to just one item, it would be the waffle fries. I know it sounds silly, but they're so yummy! The chili and cocoa powders plus the mysterious \"fry dipping sauce\" really makes it pop. Also, check out the shop for more chocolate goodies, really cool beverage containers, and a free sample!"

            "review": "I waiver on how exactly to rate this return experience. Service was 1 star, entrees were 2 to 3 stars, and dessert was 5 stars. I think what we have concluded from this return experience is that the manager is awesome and it's best to stick to menu items containing chocolate (I really should've ordered that amazing crepe again).\n\nI suppose as to be reasonably expected, the place was packed. I must say that some of the tables are quite close together. The person sitting at the table behind me was constantly knocking into me throughout the course of our dining.\n\nOur server was...odd? I can't quite find the right word. It was the weirdest, and worst, serving experience I think I've ever had. So here's the somewhat play-by-play:\n\n- We sit for while. Server comes over, says nothing, and sets down napkins. \n- We sit there again for awhile. Server comes over and takes our drink and appetizer order, quickly picking up the menus and swiftly departing before we can finish ordering. Uh... \n- Server returns, says nothing, sets down forks, and quickly leaves again before we can say anything.\n- Server brings waters and apologizes for the drink wait saying it wasn't his fault (never thought that it was his fault). We then manage to capture his attention and place our entree order.\n- Wings arrive, but we have no plates or knives (yes, some of us are strange enough to want to eat wings with a knife and fork). But thankfully, the server eventually comes by to ask how everything is and we are able to ask for the knives and forks.\n- Drinks arrive, but he gives none of us straws (which ok, may not be totally necessary, but is customary for things like ice tea - and we wanted straws).\n- Server comes over and snatches the plate from in front of me (reaching across the table to do so), never saying a word (ok, yes, I was now done and all the other plates were already cleared, but it was really awkward and weird).\n- Entrees arrive (not delivered by our server). Server never comes over to check on how things are. We take our time eating - server never makes another appearance.\n- Manager comes over and asks how everything is (after we are almost all finished eating). He is very nice and insists that we tell him the truth about how everything was (maybe our exchanged glances gave us away when he didn't buy the whole \"everything's fine\"). My husband filled him in on some of the basics and he sincerely apologized and said dessert was on him.\n- We are asked if we want anything else to drink (by someone else, not our server). We all order re-fills finally.\n- Manager comes back and takes our dessert order.\n- Server comes by to ask if we are all set (our check in his hand). When my husband says that we are still picking at it (but otherwise all done), the server snatches the check back and speeds off. Uh...\n- Eventually, the server brings the check back and we pay.\n\nThe food was a-ok. Perhaps we just ordered the wrong things? Or perhaps it was just that almost everything was over-cooked?\n\nThe excellent:\n- The wings were divine. Absolutely divine! Definitely 5 stars for the wings. Perfect size and meatiness. The sauce was amazing! It was a BBQ-type sauce, but with a slightly spicy kick and hints of orange (and everything had a very light dusting of chocolate). And the dipping sauce was fantastic. It was blue cheese with something I can't quite pinpoint added to it. So so yummy!\n\nThe good:\n- The home fries that came with my omelet were quite delicious. Perfect amount of crispy on the outside and perfect seasoning. And the diced peppers added a nice kick and sweetness to them.\n\nThe a-ok:\n- The hangover omelet was good. The fillings and cheese were very generous which I appreciated. The flavors were good. It just wasn't anything particularly notable. And it was a little over-cooked.\n- Pretty much ditto on the breakfast skillet my dad ordered.\n\nThe so-so:\n- The burger looked so insanely delicious, but it was well-done instead of the medium my husband had ordered. Now, of course, this didn't stop him from eating all of it. But then again, it's not like our server came over to ask how it was. (We were pleasantly surprised when the check arrived and the burger was taken off.)\n- The waffle fries were ok. Good crispiness, but the dusting of chocolate and chile powder didn't actually seem to add any flavor to them. Not as good and exciting as we anticipated.\n\nThe \"can't barely eat this\":\n- My mom claimed the Belgian waffle was barely edible. She did not like how dense it was and felt it was over-cooked.\n\nNow, the desserts, of course, were divine. The chocolate fondue was delicious and fun. The chocolate truffle heart cake was amazingly decadent. And all of the presentations were amazing and perfect.\n\nIn conclusion, we will definitely be here again, but I hope we have a different server and we'll be sticking to the chocolate-based menu items (and, of course, the wings!). And big props to the manager - he kinda saved our experience this time"

It's the best place for friends to gather around over some BOMB  dessert. It never gets TOO crowded, and the restaurant is pretty big. They always seem to be able to accommodate our party regardless of the time and size.\n\nThings I've tried\n1. Creamy Parmesan Risotto: Pretty good, HUGE dish (definitely share-able), but nothing super special about it.\n\n2. Black Sesame salmon: Good sesame flavor, tender salmon. Pretty tasty, nice presentation.\n\n3. Chubby Smoked Turkey Club: Nothing too special. I've had better club sandwiches. Served with waffle fries dusted with cocoa powder. Meh. Didn't taste any of the cocoa. Did not taste as exciting as it sounded. \n\n4. The Fantastic Popsicle Chocolate Fondue: So much fun! You get 1 or 2 vanilla ice cream bars that you can dip in chocolate sauce and all sorts of fun toppings. Very tasty too!\n\n5. Suckao \"do-it-yourself\" Hot Chocolate: Another super fun Max Brenner concoction. You're giving some warm milk over a small flame and a bunch of chocolate. You add  as much chocolate as you want into the milk. Fun drink, but not as tasty as the regular Hot chocolate. I love the 'hug mug' that the Hot Cocoa is served in. You can buy your own in the gift shop!\n\n6. Hazelnut cream chocolate milkshake: Tastes like frozen Nutella. NOMS Much tastier than the frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity's and cheaper too! Again, served in a really adorable cup that can be purchased in the gift shop. \n\nGreat spot for some great dessert. Awesome service. Wonderful location (In the Forum Shops, across from the H&M)."

Once I saw the restaurant I realized it was going to be all about chocolate! \n\nI started the evening with an eighties milkshake, it is milk chocolate ganache, vanilla bourbon ice cream, and a crunchy chocolate shell. It was thick, cold and yummy! \n\nNext we had Molly's White Corn Croquettes which was only four petite croquettes made of house seasoned white corn & manchego cheese balls dusted in panko bread crumbs & lightly fried. It was a wonderful taste but just that, a tease of a taste, left me wishing for a bigger bite. \n\nFor my main dish I enjoyed Max's Sunday Mood Pasta with fresh tomatoes, spinach, ricotta cheese, tomato-pesto. It was a little dry but overall there was good flavors found near the bottom of the bowl.. \n\nWe couldn't leave with some wonderful treats for desert, and that we did get, a chocolate sampler which was a tray of tasty sweets.

Also on the tray, a banana split waffle, fluffy chocolate sponge cake, crispy chocolate egg roll, with milk and white chocolate balls.

Being vegan, the only two things I can have at their shop (not restaurant) are their dark chocolate thins and dark chocolate with almonds. I am probably a fan of their dark chocolate cocoa thins because I could finish one box in a day. I love dark chocolate and I would put theirs somewhere in between my top 20 best chocolates (and I have tried hundreds). Some people may say that their chocolate is too pricey from the amount of chocolate that you get, but trust me, you can taste the quality and richness of the chocolate (their packaging is quite nice, too). \n\nI can't wait to actually eat at their restaurant. I'm probably going to have to call first to see if they have anything vegan."

To my surprise it was a great dining and dessert experience! \n\nFOOD - 3.5/5\n\nMac & Cheese\nThis was served in a large skillet and had a side of tomato/marinara sauce and diced tomatoes. Although there were five different types of cheeses, I didn't find the cheese to be anything special like when I order truffle mac & cheese at places like Pop Champagne or Elbows Mac & Cheese in the LA area. \n\nTurkey & Gruyere Waffle Sandwich \nIt was my first time tasting a sandwich with waffle as the type of bread. I kind of wish that the waffle was crispy rather than on the soft side. The gruyere (cheese) was cut in thick slices and paired with apple, which complimented the sandwich well! \n\nDESSERT - 4/5\n\nThey ran out of the melting chocolate truffle heart cake, their signature dish! We were kind of disappointed!\n\nThe hazelnut milkshake made up for it though! I've never had a milkshake that had the perfect balance of smooth, creamy, and icy goodness until this trip! \n\nSERVICE - 5/5\n\nOur server was super friendly and was really honest about what was great on the menu and what wasn't so great. \n\nOVERALL - 4/5\n\nI would come back to try some of their other desserts or even for another meal! Their restaurant is modern and cozy for small groups or a date. The gift shop section is small and cute, you could definitely pick up something for your friend and/or family member!\n\nThere's also free wifi! My reception was so spotty, it was nice to be able to check in!!\n\nYelp 100 Challenge 2013 - 23 of 100"

The waffle fries are delish they just don't give you enough!!! POO :-( My girlfriend also got the burger, we both enjoyed it very much. We both got cocktails, she got something more fruity and I went with the Tiramisu. It Came with a cute little cookie, and very very good! They have these little vials that they put shots in, SO ADORABLE! I am a huge sucker for presentation and so far, Max Brenner you were wowing me!\n\nDessert, we decided on the popsicle fondue, very original! BUTTTTTT.. no popsicles! What?! I was a little upset because we had our heart set on this, I really wish the waitress would've notified us ahead of time, but it's okay.. they were able to give us vanilla ice cream in waffle cones and we still managed to enjoy our fondue.

Hence they have a reminder on their menu - Food first then dessert.  Any place that gives you syringes filled with warm chocolate ganache to squirt in your mouth is a place worth visiting.  \n\nThe regular food menu did not have anything that really enticed my tastebuds - sandwiches, burgers, etc.  So we ordered some appetizers that sounded good.  Mac n cheese with marinara on the side - don't ask, that is a new one for me.  It was very cheesy, a bit salty, some bacon added, but nothing that great.  The waffle fries which are supposedly dusted with chili cocoa powder were run-of-the-mill.  I could not taste the difference with regular waffle fries and the dipping sauce they came with overwhelmed the dish with saltiness.  The hummus sampler was ok, a bit too bland, but the pita chips had a great crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nThe black and tan beer battered onion rings are worth a special mention.  Most beer battered onion rings I have had at other places are overfried and bland.  When you take a bit into these, you get a wonderful hoppy, malty flavor and aroma from the beer.  A bit of a surprise if you are not expecting it, but a depth of dimension you cannot find elsewhere.\n\nNow getting to the desserts.  The sharing tasting menu is a good starting point for those who can't decide.  It states on the menu that it is good for two but you can actually have 4 people share.  There is just wayyy too much chocolatey goodness for just 2 people.  It is comprised of :\nchocolate banana waffles\nchocolate crispy eggroll\nmilk and white chocolate bar\nchocolate sponge cake\ncrunchy little chocolate pearls\nchocolate fondue with grill and fruits and marshmallows\nand chocolate ganache to drizzle over everything.\n\nThe chocolate fondue is very fun as you can toast your marshmallows then dip into the melted chocolate.  After sharing this plate, I got a shock of chocolate euphoria which resulted from the the endorphin rush.\n\nAn absolute must have is the suckao.  Although the name makes it sound like a porno term, it is a combination of suck and cacao.  It is like the hot chocolate drinks that you can find in Europe.  You basically get a little container of milk (I recommend whole) which is kept heated over a little tea candle.  Then you also have a choice of what chocolate you want - dark, milk, or white (dark recommended).  From here you add the chocolate to the milk to your liking stirring with a spoon that doubles as a straw.  As the chocolate melts and combines with the milk, you get a rich chocolate beverage, essentially chocolate ecstasy.  You are technically making your own miniature ganache and drinking it.  Few things in life can produce such joy.  If you are not use to such huge amounts of chocolate, take caution as it will literally give you a high.\n\nBest Thing - Hot chocolate"

It was simply divine and so my friends and I felt, we HAD to go there the next day. \n\nWhen we did go, there were barely any other customers there which seemed to be a good thing to us as we figured that we will be served in no time. WRONG. My friends and I sat there for 30 minutes, trying to flag down anyone that could possibly help us. NO ONE came. In the end, we went up to the bar and asked the bartender if he could take our order. He was very nice and said that he could but he was too scared to because the wait staff might get mad at him so instead he said that he will get someone to take care of us. He was very apologetic and seemed to want to help us especially after we explained to him what happened. He came back after 10 minutes (we waited at the bar) and said that someone would be serving us.\n\nWe went back to the table and went through the whole thing again: waiting, trying to catch someone's attention but alas, it all went for naught as no one came again to help us. After almost 40 minutes of waiting, my friends and I were tired and fed up. We decided to leave but not before informing the hostess about what happened hoping to get something akin to an apology. Instead, my friends and I were greeted with a very snobbish sorry and a \"have a nice day\". She didn't make any move to try and make it up to us or even offer a sincere act of apology.\n\nApparently, it doesn't matter to this restaurant whether people are in it or not. It is such a shame because the dessert is actually good."

My son ordered the salted caramel shake & it was the most runny, thin shake I've ever tasted.  Also way too salty.  Portion was very small.  For $9 you should get a nice sized shake with the tin can.  On to my banana split waffle.  Let's start w/the positives - the chocolate & caramel was outstanding.  The problem the chocolate comes in a container that probably holds 1/2 an ounce if your lucky.  This is stingier than your boss giving you praise for a job well done.  Then they put a 1 1/2 inch baby scoop of ice cream that is smaller than a child's cone at baskin robbins.  To make matters worse the waffle is so stale it tastes like it was made in the dark ages.  Seriously this place is averaging 4 stars?  I wouldn't go back unless someone's buying & even them I'd think twice.  Major bummer!"

I wanted the best of both worlds, so I asked the server if I could order 1 pancake to go with my omelette - he checked with the kitchen and they agreed so I ordered the Maxi-can omelette (plus chorizo and subbing cheddar) and one chocolate pancake.  Hubs ordered the strawberry waffles.\n\nTHE WAFFLES.  Oh wow...they came with piles of whipped cream and shaved white chocolate on top!  On the side were a strawberry honey sauce that was absolutely diving.  My stomach just growled thinking about it.  There was also a little shot of chocolate sauce on the side...fresh strawberries stopped the 3 small waffles.  Hubs really enjoyed the dish and said everything went together perfectly.\n\nMy omelette was fantastic - it was huge and covered in a really great salsa.  The fried potatoes on the side were insssaaanneee and the sugared biscut was also mind-blowing.  Seriously, it doesn't get any better.  OH WAIT IT DOES - the chocolate pancake!!  This thing was seriously the size of a wheel!!  It was chock full of chocolate, yet it was still crispy on the outside!  I used the chocolate lick that came with my omelette as a topping and it is literally the best pancake I've ever had.  I want to go back to Vegas just for this place.\n\nGo!!"

I fell in love with this place in NYC, and on a recent trip to Las Vegas, I knew I haddddd to indulge here! Max Brenner did not disappoint! The Las Vegas location is inside The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. While beautiful from the outside, it definitely did not compare to the interior of the NYC location. The NYC location just blows your away with all the chocolate-y goodness eye candy.\n\nAnyway, we each ordered an entree (I had the huevos rancheros sunrise burrito). The restaurant is cool in that it's willing to customize things for you. I was able to take out the sausage, and substitute for egg whites, with no charge. Very nice! I ordered the Italian Thick Hot Chocolate for my drink (which was my fav in NYC), and we also ordered the banana split waffle to share for dessert. It came with mini chocolate truffles, chocolate sauce, and vanilla bean ice cream. What a fantastic way to top off a meal!\n\nAfter indulging in all of the awesome food, we picked up a few goodies in the Max Brenner chocolate shop at the front of the restaurant. Can't leave without a few things to take home and let melt in your mouth!\n\nOh, one more thing...Max Brenner, please open up a store in the Bay Area!! :)"

Unfortunately, we were tired since we just landed, and plus we had a hard time finding our way to the restaurant in Caesars forum.  We missed breakfast and we were both starving, so, we went straight for the savory food menu and picked the Cande's Killer Breakfast Skillet.  We also ordered the Pearl Sugar Chocolate Waffle for something sweet since we were at Max Brenner.  First the bad, the skillet was AWFUL!  The whole thing was a greasy mess topped with cheese.  Boyfriend picked out the sausage in the skillet and moved onto the dessert while I picked out the veggies.  The waffle were a tad on the dry side but the chocolate syrup was enough to compensate for it.  The presentation was neat.  They used a tiny beaker for the chocolate; adorable!\n\nIf I ever find myself here again, I'd definitely study the menu before hand and read the Yelp reviews first for what's good."

I didn't expect them to have so much selection for a notorious chocolate place when I read the menu.\n\nThey actually have two, one that is more formal, with a simple list of salads, pastas, burgers/sandwiches, sides and appetizers. Pretty normal for a restaurant. The one that caught my eye was the Kobe Beef Burger, I decided to go with it since it costs about an extra $2.\n\nWhen I got the burger, I was impressed with the display. It's not your average plate, you get served with a wooden style pallet with this 8+ inch steel rod in the middle of the burger. It was quite huge and definitely did not make me feel bad for spending $16 on a burger. The sides were a waffle style french fries and came with a unique sauce on the side, which I put on the burger and fries. \n\nI was also impressed with their style of bowls/cups, when my seatmates ordered their pasta, it was something I've never seen at a restaurant before. It reminded me of the seat Will Smith sat in for his interview in Men In Black. I wanted one. In fact, when I have my own place, it is a goal of mine to have these obnoxious bowls that wouldn't be good for cereals or soup, but great for pastas and stir fry!\n\nWhen I bit into the burger, I was one happy camper. The thing was huge and I decided to use a fork and knife just so I don't ruin it. I felt like, it was not your average burger, might as well eat it like it wasn't a normal burger.\n\nThe atmosphere was alright, for a large group that we had (about 11 people), it was pretty decent. Kind of hard for the booth side, in case someone needed to hit up the restroom (which is located upstairs). Also, the music was played very loud, kind of like a club but it wasn't club music.. It was like, lounge or jazz... At one point they played a beat where I felt like I was in a jungle or something! Our server was nice, she had to handle a lot with a big group. I am sure I would have gotten a better experience with that if it was maybe 4-5 at most. Then again, you know what your expecting with a big group. Whats your order? Next.\n\nSadly, I didn't get a chance to have dessert as my buddies wanted to go back to the hotel and party. And I don't know if chocolate and alcohol would mix well, I mean.. It really depends what your drinking. I KNOW... Dessert is why you go there but again, the Kobe burger got to me and I my hunger was definitely satisfied. I'm also trying to watch my diet... So the burger was more than enough. Originally, I was going to go for the turkey burger/sandwich but I said, \"what the hell, I'm already here and... I've never had a Kobe beef burger... Might as well go big or go home!\"\n\nAnyways, I would go here again. Definitely for a big date night, special occasion or if I was in the area and decided to spend at least $20-30 on myself for lunch/dinner."

Seriously, my experience here blew my mind.\n\nMade a reservation via Open Table after leaving a filling but highly unsatisfying dinner.  The mood was chocolate and lots of it.  We were seated quickly at an isolated table near the back (and near the servers computer station).  We could easily see the pipes of chocolate that his restaurant in NYC is known for, and our table was large enough to accommodate the extra person who unsurprisingly arrived a bit later.\n\nSince we came just for dessert, I'll comment only on that.  The menu is fairly large, there's plenty to pick from and everyone had a hard time deciding; but all were able to pick something that met their tastes.  I had the deep fudge chocolate cake and shake dish - in addition to being highly adorable when it arrived: the shake was in a shot glass, the cake was warm, ice cream was in a separate dish, and the fudge came in a container of its own; it was delicious to boot.  I was unable to finish the whole thing, but we could attribute that to my eating off the plates of others and the large dinner beforehand.  I wanted to take it home, but as I was traveling, it wasn't an option.  Let me go back to the ice cream.  This ice cream was maybe the best vanilla based ice cream\n\nThe Maxwich was awesome.  After ordering (two of them were ordered at the table), the chef that night came over to our table to apologize and ask if she could substitute other cookies in - the answer was an easy yes, but then she returned a few minutes later with cookies in hand.  She'd taken them out of a different case where they were being sold just for the making of the Maxwich.  Phew.  The dessert came as intended and was an ice cream cookie sandwich of oooh-y (and aaaaaah-y)goodness. \n\nTasted a crepe (also good, but bananas aren't my thing, so I had a small bite) and had a sip of a hazelnut drink which was in their own Alice and Wonderland inspired cup.\n\nWaitress was friendly, and fast with waters, the food and the bill!\nPrices a bit high, but DEFINITELY worth it.\nA bit inwards once you're in the Caesars shopping area; so give yourself enough time to get there if your reservation time is important.  \n\nChocolate is calling me.

That being said, we had two different servers (about a month apart), and both had great knowledge of the menu, awesome explanations of the food and were more than accommodating towards our special requests.\n\nLet me just lay this out there for you. Max Brenner owns the crown in my book for the best Veggie Burger I've ever had. Its so good it makes me think I could give up eating meat. And then I tried their Wings.  Oh their wings...dry rubbed, awesome smoky sauce and a great in house bleu cheese. These things are killer.\n\nSecond time in, we had the BALT and Spicy Tuna Salad Sandwich. Both very good, but neither on the level of our first meal.  If you loving Avocado, you will have never had more on a sandwich than you'll get with the BALT. So much, its almost a challenge to eat. The Spicy Tuna Salad was good, just not spicy enough for my tastes.\n\nThe second time we also gave the Loaded Dessert Pizza a shot. A half pizza is about the size of a half a frozen pizza and has four slices. The pizza itself, eh...It just seems like the pizza part is treated as just the vehicle for the chocolate and goodies which makes it the most underwhelming part of the dish. That being said, anything from this place with chocolate is fine by my book (and the chocolate more than makes up for the lackluster crust).\n\nAll in all, great service, a manageable yet strong menu...and some of the best chocolate I've ever had!"

I had a skirt steak and mushroom quesadilla which was heavenly and Arkady had some sort of burger. The service was really slow, especially when the restaurant wasn't very full (we came in at 4:30) \n\nI also ordered the dark chocolate hot chocolate in a \"hug mug.\" I'm really not into the \"it will warm your heart\" presentation pieces. I wanted to know what percentage cacao the dark chocolate was, but the waitress didn't know and I wasn't going to ask if there was soy lechtin as the emulsifier in the chocolate (Gawd, I hope not.) To me, it tasted a lot like very hot frosting in a cup. \n\nThe quesadilla was great, but the chocolate was just okay, which is a bit ironic. Maybe the chocolate will wow me this time around at the Yelp party tonight!"

I knew the food was going to be heavy, but it was way too heavy for me, even though I consider myself to have a considerable sweet tooth and grew up eating Southern breakfasts.  I ordered the banana split waffles that had bananas and carmelized rice krispies on it.  The bananas and rice krispies were delicious, but the waffle had the consistency of a donut.  The whipped cream was below the waffle, so it had already been absorbed into the waffle when I received it.  I was very disappointed that the waffle already had syrup on it, so it was super sweet.  I've never had waffles where they added the syrup already for you, so it was quite a surprise.  Thankfully the chocolate ganache came on the side.\n\nI did really enjoy my chocolate chai, and if it wasn't for my Groupon I probably would have rated it lower.  I think this place is much better suited as a dessert place instead of brunch, and sharing desserts would probably be the best because it is super sweet!"

I was with a group and we were hungry and looking for place to eat. We decided to try Max B. It's now become a Vegas visit staple.\n\nEating and visiting here is a treat. The ambiance is fun and the food (sweet and savory) are both delicious.  For our meal, I was able to try the Cande's Killer Breakfast Skillet which is filling and comes with a delicious dusted sugar buttermilk biscuit to dip in chocolate sauce. For breakfast, this is a nice combo for me as I always enjoy having my eggs and sweets in the morning! I was also able to eat the Brenner Burger which is a good burger too. \n\nIf you're here, make sure to order a drink with your meal! This is the whole experience and is the most fun.  I ordered the Mocha (cappuccino with hot chocolate) which came in their cute \"Hug Mug.\"  My boyfriend ordered a chocolate milkshake that came in their tall signature \"Drink Me\" mug - one of the best chocolate milkshakes I've ever had! \n\nLastly, visit the gift shop, it's full of fun and cute treats to look at!"

I knew I was going to need a brunch spot for Sunday morning and their menu looked good.  What I experienced was pure chocolate greatness.\n\nThe waitress didn't make my selection too easy.  Everything I asked about she said was really good.  It wasn't that she didn't have an opinion.  I think she really did enjoy everything I was considering.\n\nFor starters, I ordered the Choco-Pops chocolate drink.  It's served warm in a \"hug\" mug that requires using both hands.  It was probably some of the best chocolate I've ever had.  If the waitress had twisted my arm, I would have considered getting multiple cups.\n\nAlmost everything on the food menu appeared to include chocolate of some form.  I bet it's all good.  For my entree I went with the Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes.  They're topped with pecans, caramelized bananas and served with both dark and white chocolate sauces.  They were perfect and delicious.  All the flavors complimented each other very well and you could tell the chocolate was of a good quality.\n\nIn addition to my pancakes, I ordered a side of bacon.  I'm not sure exactly what it's seasoned with, but it had sort of a spicy, Cajun flavor.  It tasted so good with the sweetness of the pancakes.  I'd definitely recommend adding the bacon to any dish you order.\n\nI'm going to keep the Max Brenner restaurant on my agenda for my future trips to Vegas."

We tried the restaurant on Sunday and it did not disappoint.  It is \"gimmicky\", but remember that Vegas is all about a different experience.  This is definitely a place to take kids (order the mac and cheese $8.25) and make room for dessert.  Entrees are pretty good,  and prices are standard with comparable restaurants.  What you are paying for is the atmosphere---e.g. kids get a super sized \"syringe\" when they order the mac and cheese which is filled with a marinara sauce.  They loved this concept.  My kids especially enjoyed the chocolate pizza with toasted marshmallows on top--which I didn't care too much for because I was enjoying my chocolate cake oozing with warm milk/white chocolate.  I played it safe and ordered a burger which was delicious.  Service was excellent.  Our waitress,Danielle, was fantastic and was responsive without being intrusive.  This place is much better than Serendipitys (both NY and Vegas) and lots more fun than Cheesecake Factory or Grand Lux Cafe.   By the way, this restaurant is bigger than the one in New York."

First I got a free chocolate sample in the store, a chocolate covered praline, and I knew I had to eat here (I liked it better than Vosges which is at the other end of the Forum shops).  Then I got a great whiff of the giant decorative jars of spices and chocolates on the wall...it was like breathing wonderland.  Then my mind boggled at the drinks and dessert menu.  I ordered a burger thinking that if it was ok I'd probably eat half and still be able to have a drink and dessert.  By the time my burger showed up I had settled on a dark hot chocolate to drink.\n\nThe number of ways this meal went right is astounding.  Crisp, freshly-fried, well-spiced fries and a tasty spicy sauce.  The burger was really amazing.  It had several flavors perfectly balanced: buttery toasted bread, beer battered onion rings (amazing), flavorful burger pattie with grill marks, real chedder, fresh tomato slice and lettuce...and it went very well with the dill pickles on the side.  This burger was the best I've had in a long time, through the amazing composition and attention to details.  I just had to eat (almost) the whole thing and so I didn't have the appetite for a dessert.  The waitress was mostly attentive.  They even give a discount at the shop after your meal.  Everything I saw the servers bring out to the tables looked amazing.\n\nIt wasn't quite perfect (not comfortable chairs, music a bit too loud, burger was well-done even though they asked me if I was ok with medium, and the hot chocolate was about the consistency of milk (too thin for me)), but for prices on par with the Cheesecake Factory nearby I wish I could bring everyone I know to try it out."

After all the smack talking I do about chain restaurants, it is nice to find one that snaps back. \n\nI took my sister here for restaurant week and we had a stellar lunch. I am still reeling from what a great deal we received. For $20.11 we got a three course meal with options. We ended up getting two meals and splitting everything. The first course was a Mediterranean dip and pita. You get a choice of Babaganoush, Hummus, or Roasted Eggplant. I ordered the last of the three options and it came with eight pieces of pita and some roasted bell pepper. It was thoroughly enjoyable. My sister got the Caesar Salad and it had massive chunks of avocado in it. The dressing could have used some anchovies or more citrus, but eating the salad without any dressing was just as good.\n\nSecond course was the entree. I ordered the BBQ burger with onion rings, tomato, and lettuce. My sister got the Most Awesome Tuna Salad Sandwich (their name) and it lived up to it's name. The crumbled BBQ potato chips mixed in does give it a unique flavor and texture. Sometimes you just have to ask if they were high when they came up with this stuff. Both came with a small serving of waffle cut fries. The serving was beyond generous. \n\nNow for the best part of the meal. Desserts are were Max Brenner truly shine. The Banana Tempura Fondue was fried to golden perfection. It kept its texture well, but even after drowning it in caramel and milk chocolate. The Chocolate Pizza with Hazelnuts and Bananas was too much. In the end, we packed a few boxes and called it a day.\n\nIf given the option, sit outside in the courtyard, because it is a great place to people watch."

Since it was a Wednesday night, we figured we would have no problems getting in and having a good dinner.\n\nWhen we arrived we were hit by the wonderful chocolate smell that came out of the restaurant. It wasn't an overpowering smell, and it wasn't the smell of cheap chocolate. This was the good stuff. We were seated under the stairs corner \"booth\". The place wasn't that hopping, but again, it was a Wednesday at about 7:30pm. However, we did see a constant line at the hot chocolate bar. \n\nWe opted to not get hot chocolate or milk shakes as we didn't want to spoil our dessert after dinner. I ordered the margarita panini  and the wife got the veggie burger. Both sandwiches came with waffle fries. These waffle fries are some of the best fries I've ever had. The aioli dipping sauce was also incredible. My panini was spectacular. The bread melted in my mouth, and the cheese and veggies were perfect. The portion size wasn't too big, but if you eat the fries and are getting some sort of chocolate, it all evens out in the end. My wife's veggie burger was amazing. The veggie patty was homemade, as in, not some frozen nastiness. You could see some of the veggies inside (edamame!) and the patty had a very nice crisp to it. The bun was also incredible. Very buttery and a perfect compliment to the patty. \n\nFor dessert we had the peanut butter euphoria. Homemade dulce de leche ice cream, peanut butter ice cream, toffee bits, caramelized bananas and bits of nut. The sundae is massive. We couldn't finish it. Every ingredient stood out, and nothing was overwhelming (except the size). Euphoria is a good name for this dish. It was epic, and almost life changing. It was a tough decision as to what to get, but we are glad we went with this one. \n\nI was pretty excited about the price for the food. For our two entr\u00e9es and the shared dessert we were only set back $45 (not including tip). The desserts are the price of the main dishes, but I think on the Strip that is totally worth it. \n\nThe service at Max Brenner was also top notch. I would expect this at a Strip restaurant, but sometimes we just aren't lucky. \n\nThey do have a chocolate shop above the restaurant. We didn't hit it up this time, as we want to save that for a time when we have family in town. \n\nThis is a great place for a date night, or after show desserts."

After sampling the fondue at home, we *knew* we had to try the restaurant in Vegas.\n\nAnd it didn't disappoint! The dessert *wowed* us more than the lunch items we ordered (turkey club sandwich and fish tacos) but the lunch items were still very good.\n\n4/5 stars for the fish tacos (ordered with extra avocado). The fish was seasoned well, chipotle and blackened and a little burnt on the edges which I really liked.\n\n3/5 stars for the turkey club sandwich (the bacon was extra crispy which was a plus). I felt that the texture/quality of the sandwich bread could have been better, or they could've seasoned the turkey more.\n\n5/5 stars for the fries - seasoned with pepper and chocolate powder! Super delicious.\n\n5/5+ stars for the chocolate lava cake with milkshake shot & homemade ice cream. PURE INDULGENCE! It was sooo good and well presented, thinking about it makes me crave some!\n\n5/5+ stars for the service and ambiance.\n\nA really good place to come for lunch/brunch or an afternoon snack or after dinner desserts."

Happy hour is only at the bar; it was hard to find a place to sit, but we eventually got a seat. \n\nWe got the chocolate martini, white russian, and s'mores concoction. We also wanted to try the chocolate pizza, but it was just too rich and sugary that we couldn't take it anymore. Don't get me wrong; it was all very delicious, but one can only take so much sugar. I can't wait to go back again for my next sugar rush. Maybe next time we'll have sweet drinks and savory food or vice versa. \n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: Remember to brush your teeth after you eat here so you don't get cavities."

I found this place while flipping through one of the Vegas magazines so glad I did. My boyfriend was hesitant to go at first and even he thought it was pretty good. We were seated right away good friendly atmosphere. I had the chicken sliders which were very tasty. I also had the melting chocolate truffle cake, best I've had. When they brought it out I didn't know where to start everything looked so good. They bring it out on a platter with ice cream, a chocolate shot, and extra chocolate in a cute little tin container. Everything was absolutely delicious my mouth is watering just thinking about it. \nThey also have a small little shop and of course I had to take some chocolate back home with me. There was a very nice girl at the register gave some good tips on things to do. I cant wait to go back to Vegas it will be on my must stop list. \nOriginal visit was in December 16, 2010"

Can you pick a dish that's good to share? You bet. Can you also get savory items, if you're so inclined? Apparently, though we did not get a chance to sample anything savory.\n\nWe were crazy enough to think, \"Hey - I'm feeling a bit overly stuffed, but wouldn't something sweet be GOOD right about now?\" \n\nWe're masochistic. Or crazy. Or overly-ambitious. Or maybe all three. \n\nAt any rate, we ended up at Max Brenner's cute little establishment kind of late on a Friday night. We got a table for three on the \"patio\" right away, and squabbled over which kind of fondue platter we'd order. I was drawn to one of the ice cream fondue creations (because, really - how can you go wrong with ice cream?) while the other two were listing off the virtues of ordering the fondue for two.\n\nI finally relented, and we ordered the fondue for two (even though we were sharing it amongst the three of us), with dark and milk chocolates. The menu said that the fondue would come with things like tempura bananas, chocolate sponge cake, waffles and choco-pops. In reality, we got banana slices, strawberries, marshmallows and a couple pieces of banana bread, with an extra container of caramel sauce.\n\nI guess they were improvising at that point. \n\nEverything was delectable, though I wanted to try the waffle pieces. I was surprised by how rich and smooth the chocolate sauces were. You expect the chocolate to be delicious, but everything was so silky and shiny - it was perfectly tempered and so cutely displayed!\n\nOur waiter got extra points for putting up with us, and sharing some of our jokes. It takes a special personality to handle us sometimes, believe me.\n\nI would have liked to have gone back to try the savory items, and maybe give the spicy hot chocolate a go, but the timing didn't work out. It's definitely on my list for our next Vegas visit, though."

One time I had a chilli orange dark chocolate with puffed rice, it was the most amazing piece of chocolate I have ever tasted.  I bought a little box of them and have not seen it since last July.  Godiva is nice but Max Brenner is definitely on a different level.   \n\n\nTheir food is good here and the atmosphere is nice considering it's in the mall.  I've had all wonderful experiences here the numerous times I've come for lunch while shopping, and to buy gifts except one time.  About two weeks ago I was here and trying to find someone to help me with chocolate selection.  The two women who were working there, told me with a hand gesture to wait \"one second,\" and continued their conversation behind the counter.  I stood there politely and listened to their unimportant conversation.. 2 minutes, 5 minutes, and then I saw that I was there standing for 10 minutes just watching them talk while they ignored me and I walked out totally pissed off.  I've been thinking about phoning in to complain about the women, but it's more my style to YELP the complaint in the hopes that someone in management will hear.  \n\nOn a more positive note, this is the only bad experience I've had here, there are so many times where I've had lunch here and the service (which is always secondary in importance to me next to the food) is perfect.   Try their espresso/chocolate drinks they are phenomenal."

            "review": "Came back again after completing the Vegas RnR half marathon.   Their hot chocolate and their cookies are the best I've had.  \n\nTheir italian hot chocolate is so creamy and smooth that it coats your esophagus all the way on its down to your stomach and it leaves you with that warm feeling of satisfaction.   It tastes like melted chocolate.  In my last review, I wrote that I felt like I was drinking the from the chocolate river of Willy Wonka's factory.  (Though, if you think about it, Wonka's chocolate river would be a cesspool for disease and bacteria).  Nevertheless, if you want to see what an uncontaminated hot chocolate river would taste like, then you should check this place out!\n\nTheir cookie is filled with chocolate chunks and heavy.  It's dense, its perfectly chewy, and it's just really rich and great.  At $5 a pop it's expensive, but that's because of how much chocolate they pump into it.  I wouldn't be surprised if they told me that the cookie was a quarter or half a pound.  \n\nIf you're looking to buy chocolate from their shop, I have to tell you that their chocolate is probably as good as it gets.  It's only matched by XOX Truffles in SF.  I bought a box of their \"Caramelized Pecans rolled in praline cream and fine cocoa powder\" and it was just creamy and smooth.  It's too good.  \n\nAs you'd see in my last review, I gave them 4 stars because I felt like their savories weren't perfect.  I didn't quite like their burgers, but I did like their omelette.  Try your luck with their savories if you'd like (though I'd recommend that you go elsewhere), but absolutely don't miss their sweets."

            "review": "I'm seriously addicted to chocolate. I must have it every single day or I start to shake, get angry and feel like death is upon me.  So, whenever I'm at Caesar's Palace, I make it a point to stop by Max Brenner to get my chocolate fix.  They're always busy.  I'm not picky as to where I sit and enjoy my chocolate so most of the time, I eat at the bar so I don't have to deal with shenanigans.  Or you can also go to the chocolate shop attached to the restaurant and grab boxes of chocolates, shirts, chocolate-scented bath stuff, etc.  I always get tin cans of chocolate-covered pistachios and chocolate-covered hazelnuts.\n\nI've honestly never tried their savory dishes.  Who needs a savory meal when you can have chocolate for lunch/ dinner?  My favorites are:\n\nHazelnut Cream Banana Toffee Crepe:\nA nice crepe filled with chocolate hazelnut and sliced bananas.  In a small beaker, chocolate sauce to pour all over the crepe.  Caramel ice cream. Chocolate wafer balls.  5/5\n\nBanana Split Waffles:\nCrunchy waffles with banana halves topped with vanilla ice cream. A beaker of chocolate sauce and some chocolate wafer balls. 5/5\n\nChocolate Chunks Pizza:\nA pizza with melted chocolate on top then 2 toppings you want: peanut butter, hazelnut, marshmallows and bananas.  Or you can get The Works to get all toppings.  I personally like hazelnut and banana.  5/5\n\nFondue:\nYou have 4 options:  tempura, sugar churros, classic European and S'mores.  Of these, I like the classic European because you have a wider variety of goodies you can dip into chocolate such as cookies, marshmallows, sponge cake, strawberries and bananas. 5/5\n\nIf chocolate is my drug, Max Brenner is my dealer."

I think we ordered more food but I was entering a food coma already so I sort of forgot, I just know the bill came out a little under $100.\nI'd compare the food here to a really good version of Friday's, good but nothing amazing.\nThe portions were pretty decent, big enough that most normal people would call it a meal."

            "review": "This will be my review of my Restaurant Week 2011 experience with Max Brenner.\n\nI made my reservation for a lunch at MB with my mother. I truly wanted to take her out for Restaurant Week and seeing that MB had a yummy sounding cheeseburger I knew it would be right up my mother's alley. \n\nWe arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation and we were seated promptly at a very, very small table for two. The table was just... small. I don't know what to make of it. That's the main reason I'm not giving a 5-star rating. Especially considering the large plating options they use here I just wonder who thought such a small table was appropriate for dining? Drinking lattes, sure, but for full-blown meals? No way!\n\nOur server seemed delighted that we would be taking part in their RW menu, she asked if we wanted wine, but my mother and I both declined and got Ice Teas instead. Once we took a look at the menu, it was obvious we would each order something different and share. So, with that being said, the following is what my mother and I ate:\n\nCrispy Spice Dusted Pita Chips with Creamy Hummus\nChicken, Bacon & Cheddar Rolls\nThe Brenner Burger: Max's secret barbeque sauce, lettuce, tomato, cheddar & vidalia onion ring on top, came with waffle fries, dipping sauce, and pickles\nThe Unforgettable Spicy Tuna Salad Sandwich: tomato, lettuce, pickled jalapenos, crushed bbq chips brushed with cilantro & avocado mayo also came with waffle fries, dipping sauce, and pickles\nChocolate Chunks Pizza (1/2 serving) with hazelnuts and roasted marshmallows\n/Banana Tempura Fondue: warm & crispy banana bites, pure milk chocolate dip, toffee sauce \n\nThe hummus and roasted peppers that came with the pita chips were very good and the peppers were an excellent addition. The burger was delicious. I can't compliment the chefs here enough on how well they cooked the burger to my mother's specifications, medium well. The spicy tuna salad sandwich I think I could eat everyday and it has practically changed my mind about tuna sandwiches all together. If every restaurant could make tuna like that, I would eat it every time I go out.\n\nI felt as though the pizza was not as good as it is hyped up to be. The dough/bread was the downfall for me. Yes, it is clever and cute, but when it comes to taste - meh. I personally think everyone should go with the fondue! Because the banana tempura was out of this world! \n\nI will definitely be going back to Max Brenner to eat off their regular menu now. Plus I want to have a milkshake and other desserts! Overall this was a great experience."

I was so stoked that he planned this because he knows how much I LOVE chocolate. This place is all about the presentation! The ambiance, the displays, and even food presentation!\n\nWe had reservations and were able to get walked in. Our server was prompt and even gave us a few suggestions on the menu. She informed us that we can get complimentary chocolate samples! We both started out with \"hug mug\" drinks which is basically hot chocolate! At first we opted for the standard hot chocolate, but we ended up loving the white chocolate marshmallow and ordered a second one of those! Be careful with the hug mugs because they get a little hot, but there is a spoon for you to use on the side.\n\nHoney ordered the Grilled Chicken Panini and he said that it was delicious! I ordered the Mushroom & Ricotta Pizza.. and that's how I discovered that I am not a fan of ricotta. After picking it off, LOL, it was definitely one of the best pizzas I had in a long time! We split their Cookies & Cream Shake and ended the meal with the Classic European Chocolate Fondue. It was the best chocolate fondue this girl has ever had. Beat out the Sugar Factory by far!\n\nThe second time that I ate here was taking a friend out for her birthday! We had ate dinner beforehand so we were just coming for the delicious desserts. She got the S'Mores Concoction which was on an adorable display and I got the OMG Chocolate Chunk Cookies, the dark chocolate. The server explained to us what everything on our cute platter was before we dug in. This was seriously a delicious cookie. It had the right little crunch on the outside and the soft gooiness I love on the inside. It was perfect. I also had chocolate syrup, whipped cream, and minted strawberries as my sides. \n\nDon't worry Max, as long as you stay good to me.. I'm never leaving you."

When I went here I ordered the Brenner Burger (kobe), which was just alright...nothing too memorable.  For my drink, I ordered the salted carmel hot chocolate (I believe), which was very good.  For dessert my friends and I got the Classic European Chocolate Fondue with the pure milk and white chocolate sauces.  The dessert included bananas, strawberries, marshmallows, and banana bread to dip into the chocolate sauces.  Our dessert was gone within minutes.  The chocolate was rich and the perfect balance of not being too sweet either.  The most surprising part was the banana bread that came with it, it tasted delicious with our chocolate sauces.  The dessert was also served with a mini burner to roast our marshmallows on.  The service was friendly too, definitely swing by here for desserts!"

It had red chili, nutmeg, cinnamon and pepper in it.  I know the chili and pepper sound a little weird in a chocolate drink, and it does tingle, but it's a fascinating sensation, and really pleasant.\n\nI was admittedly disappointed by the decor.  They have these pipes labeled \"Chocolate\" that run through the bar and look like they are depositing chocolate from some untapped source a la Willy Wonka to their chocolate dispensers.  After inquiring, the waitress admitted they don't really tap chocolate from an underground well.  Consider my dreams shattered.\n\nI give it 4 stars based on only having one drink thus far and no further frame of reference, but I could see this being a good date place.  The service was nice, the decor is pleasant (even if it lies), and our server was friendly.\n\nNot bad for an impromptu treat."

What better way to be in Vegas then go shopping at a three story H&M and then go across the way to having chocolate to your hearts content?!?! (No better way) My husband and our friend decided that they would get drinks well they waited for the girls to finish up their shopping, so they decided on Max Brenners. They got some pretty good drinks, but of course us girls came along and we got a way better deal out of it all. All I have to say is that the GM came out saw that I was carrying chocolates from another company and it set off an event of things to come. He made us everything thing from homemade chocolate covered bacon, we got free chocolate martinis, and many more things. My good friend is vegan and couldn't have a lot of things that they were giving us, so the bartender/ barista went out of the way to figure out something that she could have. When we got our bill and they only charged us for 2 drinks. It was amazing !!! \n\nI've never experienced anything like it and the customer service was just through the roof. Everyone was so nice and friendly to us. We actually went back for brunch the next day, just because the food looked so amazing and it truly was. We had a few different kinds of sandwiches (even a waffle sandwich), the corn cakes, and some different kinds if mochas. The food is actually really really rich, so I suggest splitting it with someone, or taking some back with you. The mochas are really good and the chocolate they use is of such great quality. They come in these really cool cups that are suppose to warm and make the chocolate taste better or something like that. (Honestly I can't remember it was definitely a funky cup though.) The chocolate martinis are really good too (they are also nice and strong), they put this skewer of marshmallows in it and top it all off with more chocolate of course. \n\nAll I have to say is that if you really like good food and LOVE chocolate then this is the place to be in Vegas. The service is awesome and Max truly could have not done a better job of making such a great restaurant. (Not true it should be completely made out of chocolate!!!)"

Groupon had a $12 for $24 deal so the purchase was made with the idea that LA is only a few hours from Vegas and we'll be out there in the six-months before the Groupon expires. Well time did what time does and the expiration date was fast up on us so a trip to Vegas was planned. Another couple was found to join us on the adventure and we made our plans to stop by the outlets to shop and then go here for dinner. So pretty much we drove to Vegas for dinner just to save $12. Doesn't make a ton os sense but it turned out to be a really fun day that was highlighted by some tasty grub and chocolate.\n\nSo we drove all the way from LA to Vegas for dinner, that's a lot of pressure but Max Brenner lived up to the hype we had built up for it. The Unforgettable Spicy Tuna Salad Sandwich is actually unforgettable mostly because they put crushed up bbq chip in the sandwich which is something I've done after a night of drinking but never thought I'd see it in a restaurant. The Waffle fries that come with it are dusted with cocoa but I just didn't get any of that flavor. Maybe my taste buds had been over worked by the jalapenos from the sandwich. Next time I want to try the turkey burger, i hear it's bugerlicious. \n\nThe little lady does this disgusting thing where she will order a pasta with alfredo sauce and not only ask for extra but ask for extra extra and she usually has to ask for more. i swear she should weigh 400lbs and no longer be a little lady. She of course asked for this when she ordered and I was amazed that when it came out she didn't have to ask for another side of alfredo sauce. The friends that were with us also ordered a pasta dish so there was some making a comparison between extra sauce and normal person sauce was easy. They didn't drown the pasta in alfredo but there was a little extra. I think it's because they have good hearty sauces and you don't need to drown pasta in it to get the goodness.\n\nWe were all pretty full after dinner so we decided to share a dessert. Even though we wanted to try so many of the sweets they have we figured sharing the Crystal Sugar Churro Fondue would be the easiest to share. We all agreed that we could have done without the muddled raspberries but really enjoyed the chocolate and caramel sauces. Don't judge us but after the churros were gone we might have dipped a knife in the sauces. fat kids at heart I tell ya, fat kids at heart."

Immediately upon walking in, we were transported to a magical chocolate factory! Honestly we took about 20 minutes before we could decide what we wanted! Too many good choices. \n\nI ended up getting the prosciutto waffle sandwich with a side of their famous waffle fries! The sandwich was bursting, and really worth the money. The lemon aioli was really tangy and flavorful, and the prosciutto was super tasty! My only complaint is that it was a little dry, and could have used more aioli. The waffle fries were really crisp and nicely seasoned, and the chili mayo dipping sauce that came with wasn't too bad either! We also got a cup of the chocolate ranch which was really interesting, and went pretty well with the fries! \n\nMy girlfriend got the white chocolate French toast, which was AMAZING. The French toast was nice and fluffy, yet crispy on the edges as they should be. The white chocolate came in a cool little flask that you could pour over, and was really good quality chocolate! \n\nOverall, I think Max Brenner was a really great brunch place, and we are definitely coming again! My only regret is that we were too full to try the desserts.

            "review": "Yum, yum, yum!  I finally made it back here since the CMYE and it's great!  \n\nThe drinks were great at the CMYE so we had to try more of them.  My husband had the Dreamsicle ($11.95) and it is excellent.  It tastes just like an alcoholic creamsicle.  It's made with vanilla vodka, Grand Marnier, OJ, and vanilla sauce.  I would try to replicate this at home but I have no clue what vanilla sauce is.\n\nI had the Psychedelic Punch ($11.95) which is rum, triple sec, and a secret exotic juice blend.  Ooooo, secret!  Very tasty and it comes with a side of Chambord and grenadine in a little bottle.  For those who attended the CMYE, it's the same little bottles they served the milk in (no mas leche, Paolo and Allan!).  I'm not quite sure why it's on the side, and it definitely was not one of the ingredients listed for the drink on the menu.  I just poured it all in and drank it down.\n\nFor food, we had the B.A.L.T. ($14.50) and the blackened skirt steak and mushroom quesadilla ($14.95).  Both were very, very good.  I agree with Misti on the B.A.L.T. - there's gotta be a whole avocado in there.  The waffle fries that come with the B.A.L.T. are to die for!  Just like Chick-fil-a, but crispy and spicy.  The menu says there is cocoa powder on the fries - I couldn't taste it at all and I don't think I would want to, either.  The only bummer is that they only give you a few waffle fries - like 6 or 7 - with the sandwich.  \n\nThe quesadilla has a good spice to it and comes with some extra sauce, once again in the little milk bottles.  The sauce was a little difficult to get out of the tiny milk bottle and almost fell off the plate when the waitress cleared the table.  Those little milk bottles must break all the time.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the banana split waffle ($13.95).  This is also very good.  It comes with chocolate krispies (my fav), chocolate ganache, and caramel.  There is supposed to be a vanilla bourbon ice cream on top, but I didn't taste any bourbon.  The waffle is very crispy and yummy.\n\nWe also shared a peanut butter chockie ($7.50) which is basically a chocolate and peanut butter shake.  It comes in a cool, Alice in Wonderland inspired glass with metal straws.  My husband got more of this than I did because my straw was defective.  Tasty shake but I'm not sure about the metal straws.\n\nThose tiny little philly cheesesteak sandwiches that we all adored at the CMYE are only available Monday-Friday, according to the menu.  Also, they seem to have free wifi but I couldn't get it to work.  I figured I'd talk to my husband instead of screwing around with my iPod touch so I didn't ask what's up.  But if they get this fixed it'll make my unexpected wifi list.\n\nGreat service and they took my Groupon with no problems.  Keep in mind when ordering - the tables are really small and the plates are pretty big.  Not particularly good for trying a variety of items.\n\nCan't wait to come back.  Next time I'm getting a big plate of waffle fries and Euphoria peanut butter chocolate fudge sundae (which my husband vetoed).  Sooo good!"

The chocolate sauce drizzled over it perfectly along with the ice cream and caramel layer and mini crunchy chocolate balls.  I'm not a sweets person, but this one got to me."

I believe it was called the mocha madness. As good as the cocktail was, paying around $14-15 is way overpriced for a small drink. Yes, it does taste pretty good and it is really unique and I love the plating but as good as it was, I think I rather spend my money somewhere else. (No offense) \n\nMy friend got the ice cream bar thing. It was around $8 for something that's prob not really homemade ice cream that comes with 3 toppings: nuts, chocolate sauce, and chocolate pebbles. As I said, I really love the plating but the ice cream was eh. The weird part was seeing my friend not even using half the toppings for each item...so to me I just find this place to be overprice.\n\nCan come and try the mocha madness(which was pretty good) but I'm just saying it's not really worth the price. So maybe come and try it out and see for yourself?"

That's just what it was. Now normally, I don't go for wine at all, but this one was pretty alright. I could definitely taste the chocolate in it. My friend didn't really like it but hey, he's a guy. \n\nI ordered the baja style fish tacos, that were served with red beans and steamed rice. But I had them put the fish on the side cause I'm a crazy vegetarian. But my friend ate it for me & was like OMG! This is freaking amazing! He said that it was very chili-lime flavored. So I'm assuming that it was pretty good. Just the coleslaw in the tacos was good to me. Although I would have liked Mexican rice instead of white. \n\nMy friend ordered the southwest Caesar salad. It was your basic Caesar salad, served with homemade croutons, grape tomatoes, avocado and a cheese crisp wafer thing. It was alright as far as Caesar salads go.  \n\nFor dessert We ordered \"the works\" chocolate chunks pizza. It was a pastry dough covered in double chocolate melting chunks and topped with crunchy hazelnut bits, bananas, peanut butter and roasted marshmallows. And I must say, I wasn't extremely impressed like I thought I would be and it looked a lot better on T.V."

I finally made the trek over during Restaurant Week for lunch.\n\nI came here with my coworker and fellow Yelper Stacy A. We made reservations just in case and although it wasn't busy when we arrived it was packed soon after. \n\nI had the Chicken, Bacon and Cheddar Rolls, the Spicy Tuna Sandwich and the Chocolate Pizza with toffee, banana and chocolate to end. Stacy A had had the Mediterranean Trio, Burger and Chocolate Pizza with toffee, peanut butter and chocolate. Our starters and the desserts were the standouts here. Not surprising for a place that specializes in chocolate, the desserts were amazing and I look forward to coming back to try more of them soon! I only wish the crush of the pizza was a little more cooked. It was a little on the doughy side, which I'm not partial to. The appetizers were delicious. The Mediterranean dish was probably my favorite. It was a pretty good size and the flavors were great. My appetizer was delicious as well. Not really what I was expecting, but I guess I don't really know what I was expecting. Crazy good though, despite it's tiny portion. My sandwich was very basic. Again, not exactly what I was expecting but still tasty. I wish I had ordered the burger instead as that looked very appetizing. It was a huge tower of a burger with onion rings and their special BBQ on top. Both our meals came with their special crisscut fries which were spicy and delicious!!!\n\nOverall, great experience and I'm glad I finally got to check it out for a meal instead of just an event. Service was a little wonky, but I think it was just our server who seemed a little nervous and unsure of herself, still very friendly and helpful. Definitely a great place for a small snack, dessert or meal. They also have happy hour, which I'm intrigued by. Prices aren't too bad either for a casino dining."

Yeah, it was like that.\n\nAfter seeing Elton John's inaugural show for the new Million Dollar Piano show, my girlfriend and I wandered through the Forum Shoppes for some tasty food and drinks. We ended up here for a few reasons, the primary two being (a) I have a thing for bald men, and (2) chocolate is never a bad thing... What better way to indulge in both after a diva-liscious evening than kill two birds with one stone over at Max Brenner?\n\nWait, there's a 9pm and later happy hour?\n\n*swoon*\n\nBald men, chocolate, happy hour... TRIFECTA!\n\nSit at the bar and you have a full menu of drinks, tapas/appetizers and desserts that are only $5.00 each from 9pm to close.\n\nDrinks:\n\n* Satisfaction Guaranteed - The name is no lie. Chocolate milk with peanut and caramel liquers... #drinkgasm in a stemless martini glass, served with a side of candied peanuts. It was almost a forget-the-food moment when we tucked into this one. This could easily be dinner and dessert rolled into one. Sweet but not cloying, rich with the milk and liquers, and a layered taste sensation for the picky palette. Beautifully done. We ordered 2.\n\n* Berry Nutty Professor - Generally good, but not our favorite. In fact, I have to admit, there was a slightly Pepto feel to it, a chalkiness in the back of the throat. The berry flavor was bright and good, but something about the combination didn't sit right.\n\n* Max's White Russian - Strong, amazing, and perfectly executed. The white chocolate (the white part of this Russian) was delivered in a little glass sipper/pitcher of sorts and you mixed it in yourself. Tasty, unique in taste, texture, and presentation; easily the best White Russian either of us ever had. Ura!\n\nFood:\n\n* Chicken Cobb Sliders - A slightly spicy, lightly breaded chicken filet on a beautiful bun (that I was told was tasty), seved with a tasty, tangy, crispy Cobb salad topping including bacon and really fresh greens. Definitely a new favorite!\n\n* Bacon, Cheese, Chicken Bites - Chicken and cheese wrapped in bacon and served at the end of toothpicks. Perfect, tender, flavorful, creamy, bites of wonderful... on a stick.\n\n* Philly Cheesesteak Sliders - Two words: Cheeze Whiz. In down-home-Philly-phashion, the meat was tender, the flavors were spot on, the creaminess reminded me of being in Philly, and the bread (I don't eat it) looked amazing (were those real Amoroso rolls?!).\n\n* Hummus w/ cocoa dusted pita chips - Fantastic texture, but the flavors were just OK. An enjoyable snack, for sure, but not something I would come here to order. Good, tasty, but not standout.\n\nAll of this for $40. Large portions, too (3 each of the cheesesteaks, 2 of the sliders, 4 chicken/bacon bites, etc.)! \n\nYeah, that. We even skipped dessert - at the chocolate place! Oh darn, a reason to return?! (As if we needed any more?) I can't wait!"

I normally don't go for fried food, but my party wanted to try them, so why not? They were amazing! The fried outside was surprisingly light and crisp, and the inside was gooey with cheese and corn goodness. The sauce was addicting! I had to stop myself from licking off the plate it was so good!! It was like a mayo type sauce, but 100 times better. \n\nDrinks:\nI should say I'm not a huge fan of chocolate in general, but I wasn't about to be the Debbie Downer of the group, and I never shy away from trying something at least once. So, I was a good sport and tried the Mexican Spicy hot chocolate. The server of course asked if I wanted milk or dark chocolate, and because I was feeling adventurous that day, I asked for half milk and half dark. Bad idea. Sometimes being adventurous just doesn't pay off. My hot chocolate came out to be spicy and bitter. Not a very good mix. However, one of the girls got the thick Italian hot chocolate, and that was delicious. Probably because it was all milk chocolate. Note to self: never get a dark hot chocolate. It just doesn't make any sense now that I think of it. Why would you choose a bitter flavor in a sweet drink?\n\nAnother girl in our group got the chocolate Chai tea. I've never had Chai tea before, but my friend is an avid Chai tea lover, and she claimed that this was the BEST Chai tea she has ever had. I tried it and I must say the Chai flavor is very strong, and it was pretty yummy for a first timer. I'm definitely getting this next time.\n\nFood:\nWhen you begin looking at the extensive menu, it can really be overwhelming because everything just sounds so good. Even for brunch, I was torn among the breakfast skillet, the cinnamon and white chocolate truffle french toast, after party belgian waffle, and the guilt free omelet. I finally narrowed it down just to the savories because it was that kind of day. I ended up choosing the burrito because other girls ordered the skillet and omelet. When you think breakfast burrito, you think big. At least that's what I think when I order a breakfast burrito. I imagine stuffing myself in egg, cheese, and whatever goodness is in the burrito. To my huge disappointment, the burrito came in a tiny serving. I can almost compare it to an egg roll. That's how disappointed I was. However, looks can be deceiving, and that's exactly what I realized after my first bite. The burrito came already cut into two, and each opening was sprinkled with cinnamon or nutmeg. It was a sweet spice that I couldn't decipher, but it complimented the burrito well. They used a red tortilla that was probably tomato flavored. I couldn't tell because you really don't taste any special flavor from the tortilla. \n\nThe burrito stuffing includes farm fresh eggs, spicy chorizo, tomato, and pepper jack cheese. It's served with spiced home fries but I substituted it with the waffle fries. My first bite was absolute heaven. The perfect amount of egg, cheese, and sausage. Not too spicy and not at all too many flavors. Everything worked together, and I just wanted to say good things do come in small packages. Sometimes. \n\nThe breakfast skillet was a pretty large serving, and it was absolutely what you would have expected: an egg hash scramble with sausage, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, spinach, mushroom, and their home fries. It's nothing new but still delicious if you want to be safe. I would say the same about their omelet. Serving was big, and it was expectedly a good omelet. \n\nIn the end, we were too full to try any of their desserts, but we all decided it was worth another trip to Vegas just for their desserts one of these days. Overall, if you're here for food, you MUST try the corn croquettes. The best I've ever had. The burrito was delicious, but order only if you're feeling adventurous and beware of the small portion. I was full in the end, but that's because I also ate part of my sister's breakfast skillet."

As one finds when coming to Sin City, a deluge of spirits run through the streets; one can hardly avoid the potency.

The corn croquettes were really interesting. They're basically fried cheese balls filled with creamy corn. I loved the lightly fried crispy texture, and the filling was perfect, a good mixture of sweet and spicy. I also had the mac and cheese, the portion was huge. This is not a saucy mac and cheese, it's basically macaroni pasta topped with a variety of shredded cheeses, tomatoes and bacon and then baked in a skillet. I would highly recommend this if you're a cheese lover. \n\nDon't skip dessert here! Max Brenner seems pretty well known for chocolate.

I felt bad taking up her time.   \n\nA huge H&M is across from here too. :)"

This was a great end to a night. got there at about 10:30pm (they close at 11pm). they sat us quickly and did not rush us at all. \n\nWe shared the fondue (Dark Chocolate, Toffee, Milk Chocolate). the presentation was great and the food they gave you tasted amazing. Marshmallows, fruit, brownies and cookies. we had to be rolled out of there. \n\nIf you love anything chocolate. don't hesitate going here."

We stumbled upon it and it had been on my bookmarks list for sometime. I'm so glad I finally made it in because I definitely plan on coming back.\n\nService was friendly and since the restaurant was not busy the upstairs section was closed:( which was a bummer because it offers views of the mall and sounds of the buzzing music from H&M.  \n\nThe nice thing is if you're a guest at Cesar's and you're just rolling out of bed around noon-ish (which probably isn't too far fetched...I mean this is Vegas) then you'll be glad to know there's  a dark dim-lit diner-ish place to come and grab some strong coffee a breakfast burrito and that much needed Bloody Mary!\n\nRecommendations were the pizzas, the club sandwich and the burgers.  I opted for the steak panini with a side of waffle fries and yummy savory dipping sauce.  Mom couldn't make up her mind so she had the burger-wow this was some cheeseburger!  Piled high with a fried onion ring, bacon, tomato, lettuce and avocado if you wanted it.  Talk about a heart-attack on a plate!  She took a few enjoyable bites and took the rest home.  I liked my panini but it wasn't spectacular.  The dipping sauce was tasty and it was perfect for the fries and sandwich to dip in.\n\nSince we had to leave I couldn't stay for dessert so I took dessert with me.  A wonderful chocolate shake, thick rich and delicously chocolatey.  MMMMM!\n\nA nice gift shop is adjoined so you can take some sweets home as a momento or a present for someone really special.  \n\nI love this place. I saw so many options on the menu like FONDUE...yummy...so next time I come in that will be on my list of things to try at Max Brenner.  \n\nCheck it out!"

I was very happy with their breakfast bagel with salmon- the only thing I was not happy about was my mimosa. The first glass was poured with flat champagne, and when I asked for another they seemed a tad annoyed, but the second glass was perfect. Keep in mind though, it was not worth $12.95, I'm used to getting bottomless mimosas for this price for where I live... I would go for the food, not drinks.\n\nOther than that, I recommend going! The food prices seem very decent for the amount of food you get. My boyfriend go the huge goblet of yogurt and granola, and the other dishes we saw across from us were giant. The desserts were delicious as well :) It's very Parisian-like with chocolate decor, very adorable!"

            "review": "~~~This is a Chocolate Love Story~~~~~\n\nOnce upon a time, a bald man name Max Brenner came up with a brilliant idea to develop a restaurant that focus on chocolate and created dozens of deliciously sweet treats that attracted customers to his chocolate haven. \n\nI got my friends excited to check in out in Vegas last weekend which they were really thrilled about after seeing all the great sweet photos on yelp. When we entered the restaurant, we were immediately taken a back by the sweet and delicious smell of chocolate.. the perfumic smell of the cocoa was just heaven.. thats usually how I feel when I enter a coffee shop like Starbucks or Coffeebean. The smell of chocolate and coffee is blissful!\n\nFOOD:\n\nSpicy Chicken & 3 Cheese Pizza- Blackbeans, jalapeno, cilantro, mozzarella, cheddar, and goat cheese. Pizza was really thin but flavor was really not there. No cheesyness to the dish that you normally look for in a pizza. For some reason it reminded me of taco bell's mexican pizza.. just how it looked minus the ground meat and beans you would find at taco bell. I would not order this again. \n\nSliced and Diced Steak Pillow Panini- Char grilled and thin skirt steak tossed with diced caramelized onionson a bed of asagio cheese crips, baby spinach, roasted tomatoes, red pepper aioli with a side of waffle fries which is sprinkled with chili and cocoa powder. Waffle fries were good and prob the best part about the dish because it was freshly fried. You didn't really taste the sweetness of the cocoa powder so I think it definitely sounds more interesting then it actually taste. The sliced steak was kind of touch and didn't have much flavor or spice to it. The sauce made the bread soggy (which is a pet peeve of mine) so when I picked it up, the bottom of the bread is all wet and soggy. The panini looked good but there was definitely something lacking in this dish because it was a let down amongst the group.\n\nChocolate Hazelnutt Shake- \"Drink Me\" is labeled on the cup. This ain't as shake.. its more like.. a chocolate hazlenutt.. melted yogurt/ice cream drink because it was SOOOO THICK. you seriously needed to suck on the straw with some force and it will get you full fast if you drink the whole thing before your meal! The shake was also really sweet too.. I passed around my drink around the table and each time someone has a taste of it, they are like \"damn.. its thick.. and really sweet.\" Total let down again and definitely looks better than it taste. \n\nThe Works Chocolate Pizza with Toasted marshmallows, peanut butter, and banana- SWEET SWEET SWEET. Crust was okay.. pretty thick and dry. I would not get this again either. \n\nDessert Crepe-  Crepe with banana, a side of choco crisps, and chocolate syrup. Crepe was good, choco syrup on the side would make your crepe too sweet but the texture of the crepe was nice and thin and good. \n\nOverall, the sweets were toO sweet for me and my friends taste and the savory dish was just \"okay\".. nothing you want to order again or made a great impression on us. Don't get me wrong, I was a fan of Max Brenner when I went to it in NY and loved the whole concept of it but for some reason it was a let down when I tried it again in Vegas. Just the price of the food and the quality and taste we received at the place just did not match. \n\nSorry Max, there isn't a happy ending to this Chocolate Love Story. You do smell good though... =P"

The first night we came here we were sat and placed our order, the person that delivered the entrees took one of our dishes to the wrong table next to us, then he went away to try to figure out where the food went. He took forever and the people at the other table ended up handing our food to us, and finally our waitress came with the rest of the food. We also ordered an appetizer and that did not come out until after the main dishes were almost gone.\n\nThe second day we came during happy hour and told we had to sit at the bar to get those prices. So we moved to the bar and two bartenders told us they would be right with us, which apparently meant more then 20 minutes, there was very few people in the place at the time too. Finally we got tired of it and went back to our table and skipped the happy hour pricing. I also noticed that two fairly attractive women came to the bar after we went back to our table, they were helped right away and they even finished and left before us. Great to know they value all the customers equally. \n\nAs far as the food, the regular food was average nothing special, not bad and not great. The desserts were actually pretty good, we had a shake and a waffle banana split. I might consider returning just for the dessert, but on the other hand with so many choices in Vegas especially in the way of food why bother coming back to a place with such bad service."

We loved the sexiness and the style of the restaurant.\nAfter that, we went back about every 4 months and still loved it.\n\nLast December (2012) however, we went back again and noticed that they had changed a couple of things. Change is oftentimes a good thing, but not in this case! We were pretty disappointed to see that the presentation was not as sexy as it had always been, and they had changed some of the plates to more boring ones.\nWhat is even more disappointing was that they had reduced the amount of food/sauces in f.e. the euphoria sundae (our favorite!) while making it more expensive.\nWe asked the waiter about it, and he said that they reduced the amount because \"people didn't like that it was so big\" ?!?!?\n\nYeah, it's big and it's definitely for two people, but you can't just reduce the amount of stuff in the sundae but still raise the prices by $2-3. I understand that they have to raise the prices every other year to keep up with inflation and stuff, but reducing the amount of food??! Very unprofessional, and very disappointing for regular customers like us.\n\nIf you're in Vegas and you've never been to MB, you should definitely get some hot chocolate there.

I noticed all the tables there are pretty small, which is fine since it gives you that small French cafe atmosphere. Waiter was attentive and friendly.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nChocolate Chai- Came in a pot filled with actual chai tea leaves and a piece of biscotti with powdered sugar. It was light and flavorful and delicious. I loved it.\n\nSlammin spicy chicken burger- Came with the chili/chocolate powder waffle fries and dipping sauce. My husband said the burger was good and I tried his fries and loved it. It was crispy and had that touch of spicynesss.\n\nGuilt Free Omelet- My omelet had mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, onions. It was more like a scramble but folded into an omelet shape with the cheese melted on top. I though the cheese on top and in between was too much for me, but they didn't skimp on the size and amount of veggies in the omelet. My dish also came with this chili breakfast potatoes which I couldn't stop eating. I wish I had more!! The biscuit was great and I believed the butter and chocolate was to be eaten together with the biscuit, strange combination, but to my surprise, fries, breakfast potatoes, biscuit..they all taste good with chocolate on it..haha\n\nOverall the meal itself was great.

We tried to argue with the manager but she kept saying \"We can't hold tables.\" Which makes NO sense. That second visit was a mood killer, probably won't be coming back for a long time."

This little chocolate stop in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace caught me by surprise.  Chocolate Syringes, Chocolate Pizza, the best/richest Hot Chocolate ever made, and the BEST COOKIE I have ever had are just a few of the things this place had to offer. \n\nBy the time a person is 28, they have had a lot of cookies.  I have had hundreds of store bought ones, ones made from friends and family, ones I have attempted, and lots from different restaurants and shops.  Now for me to say that this is the BEST COOKIE I have ever had....that is a huge deal!  \n\nA $5 cookie just sounds ridiculous but that place is going to see many bills coming out on my wallet for years to come.  Max Brenner is a must-visit place for me forever.   That heavy, warm, gooey cookie stole my heart and I want more!  I could go on forever about it but you just need to get there a.s.a.p. and find out for yourself.  Happy Eating!"

Food lover like us it totally made our trip to vegas even better. \n\nIts located inside the forum shops where I have never been to, so it was fun walking and touring inside. \n\nGetting to max brenners, we got there overly excited from looking at yelp pics all week, and all the food did not dissappoint! We started our food marathon with all of their hot chocolate drinks, one stood out was the white hot chocolate and the salted caramel shake. It was unbelievable. Then we all tried the yelp recommendations for the main dishes. Burrito was delicious, the pancakes though were nothing special. Not as chocolate-y as I was expecting and very dense for pancakes.\n\nCame back the next day for desserts, and had twice the fun. All of them are good, although ordering all of the fondue was overkill, they were all still mighty good. Had the churros fondue, very small servings for the desserts btw but still good. \n\nDef waiting on coming back here again."

            "review": "Ever since the Yelp event, I had this place in mind for the company holiday luncheon this year. At the last/most recent Yelp elite event at the Republic Kitchen bar, the question I asked most of the people that I met, was if they had gone to the event- and for the most part, the consensus was yes, and they all raved about it (because the food was sooo good). \n\nToday, it was a group of eight of us from work. The appetizers we sampled were: chicken, bacon and cheddar rolls, onion rings- both served on long heavy wooden platters, and a cheesy mac casserole- served in a round skillet. We all shared a creamy chocolate milkshake (yeah, it sounds funny, but this way we all got a taste plus we wouldn't ruin our appetites either- our server brought extra glasses and metal straws- never saw that!). \n\nThe sandwiches range from $12.95 to $14.50- served with waffle fries dusted with chili and cocoa powder, different, huh? Ok, it sounds weird, but it actually worked- it was just enough chili powder (mmm, love spice). The dipping sauce was yummy. Since I went to the yelp elite event which was primarily mini sizes, I didn't know what the standard sandwich size was- so I ordered the Max's sandwich of the seas- seasoned salmon( flavorful), carmelized red onion (so sweet- I love red onions), aioli, tomato and lettuce on a huge bun (I had to ditch the top side; it was just too much bread for me). My coworker sitting next to me, had the Brenner burger but only had half and she took off the onion rings (saved the other half for her husband to enjoy later for dinner). The coworker across from me also had the Brenner burger and said that it was good- but he didn't really eat his fries, so my other coworker ate them; he had the monte cristo sliders served with syrup (cute little things- only two though; but he ate one, and took the other one to his wife- this would be an appetizer size rather than an entree, I'd think), another coworker had the quesadilla, cut in quarters, served on shredded tortilla strips- he finished it and said it was really good, another coworker had the philly paninis (four petite things- I had them at the yelp event so I know that the beef is super tender- probably one of the best things I had at the yelp event), another coworker had the Best Balt- bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, cilantro-avocado mayo (I glanced at hers- there was a lot of avocado- I love avocado). We all had non-alcoholic drinks. The bill was a little over $216. \n\nHalf of our party was sitting on the booth part and the other half were sitting on chairs (they had to put tables together- the wrought iron bottoms were kind of awkward; had to rest my feet on top of them, or risk getting my feet crushed!)- we were in the front of the restaurant, facing the store part and kitty corner from the hostess out front. Our heads (the ones at the booth part) were near the stacked humongous blocks of chocolate ($250 each!). Our server was so good about tending to us and really was attentive, bringing us refills, extra napkins and clean silverware. The other servers were attentive as well, taking away all the dirty plates and serving dishes. It was pretty busy in the restaurant- the whole shopping center was buzzing with shoppers/tourists. (FYI: Taking the back way- Frank Sinatra- is a breeze.) The bathroom is located upstairs. In addition to the chocolate store inside the restaurant, there is a to-go bar outside (chocolate pizza slices sold here), facing the foot traffic inside the shopping center."

I was prepared for a long winding way through the Forum Shops but it was really easy to locate. We were seated quickly and our waitress came right up. I ordered the turkey savory waffle sandwich and my friend as the asian chicken salad. She said she really liked her salad but I can tell you, that my sandwich was SO GOOD. Turkey, lettuce, bacon, avacado and some real yummy sauce. We each ordered a dessert so we could try a little of each. My friend ordered the deep fudge chocolate cake (sadly, they were out of our first request - the truffle heart cake - at 12:30 pm though??) and I ordered the banana split waffle. The cake was very rich but luckily it was served with a small scoop of ice cream. I looooove chocolate and I loved every bite but there was no way I could finish my half of this cake. Next came out the banana split waffle (yes, I felt like a glutton at this point but who cares?? It's vacation. My trainer wasn't very happy with me when I gave him that excuse.) That waffle was the best part of the whole meal. Served with a shot sized amount of choclate ganache and chocolate waffer balls was the perfect balance between the waffle, bananas, ice cream and rice krispies. I loved everything about this place except our waitress. She seemed distracted and forgot that we had ordered the waffle along with the cake. But hey - everyone has off days! I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!"

My past 2 visits are based on the happy hour menu which is weekdays 3-6 and 9-close. If you are craving this place and are on a budget, by all means come during happy hour! Drink and food specials, which are unbeatable and definitely won't bust your wallet. I've been twice and will probably be back for more just to finish trying all the items on the food part of the menu. Here's the run down of what I've tried.\n\nBuffalo chicken tenders- comes with 2 large pieces and those infamous brenner waffle fries dusted with cocoa powder. You definitely get your money's worth with this because it's a good amount of food for a single person. Spiciness was just right for me and I prefer most of my buffalo style food on the mild side. Perfect amount of sauce because sometimes when you order tenders buffalo style its like dripping with sauce and thankfully that's not the case here. Breading was good and not too thick. Highly recommend!\n\nThe Mini Philly- the perfect combination of cheese and beef. It's practically a match made in heaven. I think it's the 5 cheese blend that does the trick.\n\nBuffalo chicken slider- pretty good too, but I'm not a big fan of feta cheese. Although I would recommend the mini philly rather than this.\n\nOnion rings- pretty standard onion rings. Comes with a chocolate ranch sauce, but it honestly tasted really close to plain ranch with a hint of brown color. \n\nchocolate pizza- loved every bite of it, just like I expected. Half a pizza is big portion for 1 person so you should really plan on sharing this. The combination of the chocolate marshmallow and crust does the trick- Brenner you a pure genius or chocolate genius that is, hahaha.  Another item where you will get your money's worth!"

It was nommy. \n\nWe ordered the spinach and artichoke fondue for an appetizer--which is a fancy misnomer, but I can't really fault them for that. It was still super good, super filling, and of course, super fattening. Our drinks were delicious too-- I had a mojito and my friend a glass of wine, and we guzzled them down.\n\nI didn't get to have any dessert, which is a durned shame, considering my love of all things sweet and that I was at a chocolate mecca, but I did get a chocolate bar to go.

The decor is lovely with the deep brown woods and whimsical artwork literally making me feel as if I am truly in a chocolate factory. But, even if you are not a chocolate fanatic like myself everything else I tasted made me want more. I know you want to hear about the food:\n\nFor food I had the pleasure of making out with the Pulled Pork Slider that had a citrus slaw and fried pickle on top of the perfectly tender bbq pork which was served on a lightly toasted brioche bun. To die for my friends! Next was the Philly Cheesesteak Slider. The meat was very tender and had a nice flavor as well. Lastly the BBQ Burger Slider. This was top notch in my book for tasty burgers. A melted slice of sharp cheddar and crispy onion ring was the perfect balance to the beef. I could have just left after these and been content, but now is when I go into complete ecstasy.\n\nDessert. I live for dessert. It makes all of the troubles of life disappear if only for a moment. That being said, Max Brenner hits it out of the park with ALL of the desserts I had. Chocolate/Chocolate chip cookie, Chocolate chip/Walnut cookie, I love you. They were served warm and with beakers of milk. This might have been the moment in the evening when I turned to my friends and said,\" If someone proposed to me that I wasn't really into I might just say YES if they did it here\". I cannot say enough about the quality of the chocolate used. Smooth, not overly sweet, but just divine in every way. My favorite dessert by far was the Banana Split Waffles.  The waffle was dense, warm and had a flavor like no other waffle I have ever tasted. The best I've ever tasted anywhere! It was topped with fresh banana and complimented by a drizzle of melted chocolate sauce. Home fricken run! \n\nI know I went off on the food, but I must also go off on the service. All of the staff was friendly down to the buspersons. Maybe I was tipping too much because I was actually bribing them with their trays of goodness, but I think it was because they were so nice and made me feel special. All of my friends have said the same about the staff. \n\nMax Brenner, until we meet again under the pale moonlight I am going to tell everyone who has a mouth and a belly to take a journey through Flavor Town for a VIP experience at your restaurant. xoxo"

I liked the strawberry that came with it though! \n\nOrdered their Brenner Burger, just your average, normal burger. It came with all your usual fixin's & waffle fries. The sauce was to-die for! My boyfriend had their Steak Panini & he loved it.\n\nOverall, it was a good food experience. Just wasn't a fan for their Chocolate 'Tini and ambiance. Hostess and server weren't attentive. We were in the very front of the line but the hostess decided to seat the larger party behind us because she knew them. I was in a nice mood so I didn't go off on her. The server seemed a little rude too, as if he didn't want to serve us. \n\nIt's okay though, I guess as long as you have good company, you'll enjoy it here."

From the moment you walk in, from the vat of spinning chocolate, to the chocolate syringes, to the huge blocks of chocolates, you know that you are in good hands. I tried the 80's milkshake and it was delicious and tasted almost like pure chocolate ice. It came with a mini scoop of ice cream that was coated in a chocolate shell. To go with our shake, I split the double chocolate cookie. For some reason, I think I would have preferred it room temp instead of warm (call me crazy!) but either way, it was probably one of the best chocolate cookies I've ever had.  The toppings however did not really seem to fit with a cookie dessert. You would typically see fresh fruit, whipped cream and a chocolate sauce with some sort of cake instead of a cookie, so I didn't really find them necessary."

I've been a few times (as my check-ins reveal) to purchase gift items, such as their chocolate-filled syringes, but I haven't been back to dine in. I finally had my chance last night as we sought out a dessert destination to satiate our post-Hot n Juicy appetites.\n\nIf there's one thing you can say about the bald man, it's that he sure knows how to make a dish look purty. I mean, Crystal Sugar Churros Fondue, Chocolate Chunks Pizza - it all sounds pretty delicious to begin with. But the way those desserts come out to your table, they're just a work of art.\n\nI'll be honest. I'm not a huge fan of how the churros are prepared. I want a plain churro that actually looks like a churro. To me, the churro is merely a vessel for the chocolate. I don't need it to be covered in sugar, but I do need it to have the deep grooves on the side by which it will receive the chocolate and transport it to my mouth. Partial fail on that.\n\nOn the other hand, the pizza was delectable. I'd name more dishes, but I really don't remember what everyone ordered. All I know is that this place beats Serendipity3 hands down. Serendipity is still my favorite rom-com, but Max Brenner is the better choice for not-so-cheap chocolate indulgence."

Some friends of ours told us about your happy hour specials. So we went on a Tuesday night at 9 pm. Once we got to the bar and saw our choices on the happy hour menu, we couldn't make up our minds. We loved the fact that some of the appetizers and desserts are only 6 bucks. Since it was our first time, we decided that a couple hundred more trips should be able to allow us to experience every one of your creations.\n\nI decided to go with the Max Brenner Sliders while my wife went for the Philly Sliders. For dessert, we decided to share the S'mores Concoction. \n\nWe were a bit hungry so we were thinking of ordering some more food after we put our order in. But when our two orders got there, we didn't have to because these \"appetizers\" that we supposedly ordered were pretty much meals by themselves! Both sliders were scrumptious and filling. \n\nAs for the S'mores Concoction, two words came to mind after tasting it. Rich and Decadent. It's comparable to a person just trying out drugs for the first time and is curious about other drugs. Well, I can say this dessert is the gateway to all the other desserts on your menu! So if you have a sweet tooth, you just might overdose here.\n\nSo ever since we were there the first time, we have been back several times, even bringing other friends and family with us. If we don't have kids with us, we hit up your 3 to 6 pm or 9 pm to close happy hours at your bar because you have to be 21 and older. \n\nSo in closing, maybe you should have a chocolate lovers stamp card or something because I know for sure we would have filled up about 2 of them."

All of our burgers came out and mine looked well done. I tried it first to see if it would still taste ok but it was pretty chewy so I asked to send it back. They were very apologetic but when my replacement burger came out it was pretty much a rush job. Basically now my burger was rare with a thin layer of char on the outside. Half way through my burger I got tired of tasting raw beef. One of my worst burger experiences. I didn't want to send it back again since my friends were done eating by this point. \n\nMy friends stuck with the angus beef and were a lot happier plus theirs was cooked properly. \n\nFor dessert we had the split waffle which was tasty and super sugary (a plus for those who love desserts?!) \n\nIn summary, small place in the forum. I didn't have a good experience with them but my friends liked it. Dessert was good, but considering there are so many places to choose from in Vegas, I probably won't be coming back."

Just could not believe how perfect the \"cookieshake\" was, especially with the addition of an espresso shot. Its like I found \"liquid nirvana\". It's one of those things you know you have to come back for. Definitely worth 4 stars (leaning 5 stars) - food was great, service staff wonderful, and the shake made this a two visit deal that weekend.\n\nSo of course, this past weekend, I made another trip to Vegas for a volleyball tournament and had been looking forward to Max Brenner for about 2 weeks. I even kept on telling people what I really wanted to do this entire trip (besides win of course). The \"cookieshake\" seemed all too certain since it's what everyone had agreed to do - because of me, aka \"the fatty\".\n\nSo on Saturday evening, after overstuffing ourselves at a local AYCE sushi (way off the strip), we trekked over the The Forum Shops to meet up. Excitement level = ASIAN. Yes, it was late, but they didn't close yet so it was nice to have dessert after a crazy meal.\n\nAfter sitting down, the waitress wearing nerdy glasses \"informed\" us that ALL THEIR BLENDERS WERE BROKEN. I pleaded, \"Are you sure? I came all the way from out of town looking forward to the 'cookieshake'!\" As if sounding \"sincere\" she said \"yeah, I feel bad\" and tried to offer something else on the menu. Then she redirected her attention to another person in my group as if trying to help me out would be too much of a hassle.\n...\n...\n...\n...\nC'MON!!!\n\nThen.......I see, at a far far table............... the signature \"Alice\" cocktail cup in front of a couple still finishing up their late meal.\n\nWow... I had no words. I was so upset I didn't even order anything. How's that for awful? First you're denying a \"fatty\" like me the sole reason why I even came to this restaurant in the first place by saying that ALL the blenders were \"broken\". Then the waitress didn't sound sincere enough to pass the test and convince me to order something else. Then, with my 20/20 vision I see the popular cup (obviously filled with something blended) sitting in front of a couple who is enjoying their meal at a table underneath the staircase. I even took a picture to prove to myself I wasn't seeing things.\n\nThis trip should have solidified my long-endured craving and my urge to give a stellar review. Instead, my experience here this past weekend left me wondering if I would even return or recommend to others to come anymore. It's been two days and I'm still upset. Maybe because something like this has never happened to me before. What a complete turnaround."

The Vegas location lacks some of the impact of the NY one when it comes to the chocolate smell.  The large opening connecting the restaurant to the Forum Shops probably has something to do with it.  The desserts are delicious and won't disappoint you in any city.  I highly recommended MB if you enjoy chocolate.

My favorite is the waffles, the ice cream sundays are also amazing, with all the topping served separate for you to mix."

I wanted to order everything on the damn menu when I went.\n\nMy recommendation is to go for happy hour, everything on the happy hour menu is only $6! this is the perfect time to try a few things on the menu without having to pay too much.\n\nGet the chocolate drinks--they're unreal. The Satisfaction Guaranteed was probably the best alcoholic beverage I've ever had in my life, it tasted like chocolate-peanut butter milk. The chocolate martini was also great, but my friend and I both agreed that the Satisfaction Guaranteed was better. The OMG chocolate chip cookie was meh, don't waste $10 on it. Also, the peach mixed drink on the HH menu was fantastic, if you're not in the mood for chocolate with your alcohol, or just want something fruity, get this!"

So far I've ordered:\n\n-Max's White Russian\n-Psychedelic Caribbean Punch\n-Mocha Madness\n-Guava Margarita\n-Brenner Burgers\n-Mediterranean Dipping Delights\n& Crispy Spice Dusted Pita Chips\n-Waffle Fries Dusted with Chili & Cocoa Powder\n-Banana Tempura Fondue\n\nEverything was about $6 each, off the Happy Hour menu. The White Russian has probably been my favorite drink so far. It is served on the rocks with white chocolate in a little vile on the side to pour in and two marshmallows on top (wonderful presentation). It isn't overly sweet like the other drinks I've tasted, which is why I like it the most.  We ordered Hummus with our dipping delights and it went perfectly with the crispy pita chips. I enjoyed the Brenner burgers both times I ordered them. I really like the presentation of those as well. They look perfectly constructed, like they actually took their time to layer each ingredient on top of the other. Donald actually read about the chocolate ranch, so we ordered that on the side as well and it was very tasty! The banana tempura fondue is probably my least favorite of everything we've had here so far. It is just WAY too sweet because they are deep fried. I don't think I'll ever get those again. \n\nEven though I've only come here for happy hour so far, almost everything was delicious. I definitely want to come back to order off their regular menu sometime soon!"

Point is, I really can't get enough. \n\nAnyway, Max Brenner had me at \"Do you want a chocolate shot?\" (mind you, the woman was holding a large plastic syringe filled will delicious, warm chocolate). To Pedro P.'s dismay and slight disgust, I enthusiastically agreed to have a communal plastic syringe stuck in my mouth to try some of Max Brenner's chocolate. YUM. (I also tried a chocolate covered praline and Italian hot chocolate). And when we went to the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace the next day, I opted for another chocolate shot before we went in for lunch. \n\nSure, the food we ordered was good. I had a mozzarella and basil pizza, but the star of the show was my adult beverage. I had a \"chocolate aphrodisiac\" called Satisfaction Guaranteed -- and yes, I was quite satisfied. \n\nThe drink has peanut and caramel liqueur and.... wait for it, wait for it.... milk chocolateeeeeee.

We weren't disappointed, but we weren't blown away either.\n\nThe chocolate espresso milkshake ($8) was really rich and creamy. I could definitely taste the chocolate and coffee in there; no bitterness from the coffee, definitely more like extra-milk-chocolate mocha than espresso. The whole thing was pretty filling, so you might want to share it with someone (and then you can split the price too!) The shake was served in a unique \"Alice\" cup, which they also sell in the store for ~$15.\n\nThe banana split waffles ($14) was a delightful combination of vanilla ice cream, lightly caramelized bananas, crispy waffle, warm melted chocolate sauce, and crunchy chocolate pearls. Again, you might want to split it with at least one other person - we split it four ways and that was enough for each of us. Otherwise it might be sugar-overload.\n\nThe double macchiato ($3.75), however, wasn't that great. It was served in a \"Kangaroo\" cup, which has a shallow curved side pocket where they put a few pieces of chocolate. Supposedly, licking up the melted chocolate at the end of your coffee will make you feel like a child again (or something like that...) But I didn't really see how the chocolate pieces added anything to the coffee (except for the price.)\n\nThere are a lot of other dessert options, including fondues, hot chocolates, and sweet crepes. Might be worth a try sometime, if you're willing to splurge a little."

This was a disappointment, as the tough and thick crust did not complement the smooth milk chocolate topping. Fortunately my disappointing was regarded by, who I assumed to be Mr. Brenner himself, and granted me another menu choice. I chose, another disappointment, the \"Max Wich\", which was an unoriginal chocolate ice cream filling in between a dense and overly chewy cookie and a bottom- stale textured, hard to bite, cookie, I should have asked for recommendations before ordering, but for now, all I can say is not worth the prices."

However, the Groupon stated the original value never expired, so she spoke w/ a manager (again) and said I could use it.  Dang right!  They were able to scan it at the end anyway and verify it was good, so make sure to insist to use your expired Groupon if you are denied the first time!\n\nI got the half-sized pizza with roasted mini marshmallow and hazelnut bits ($9.75).  The thing is exactly like a pizza, except for the toppings.  My friend thought the bread was too doughy (it's just like pizza dough) and preferred it to be thinner.  It was super sweet, and we could only eat a small slice each.  I prob wouldn't get this one again.  My other friend got an Espresso Shake while the other friend ordered the Banana Hazelnut Crepe ($13.95).  The crepe was really large and super sweet as well.  It was really good, though.  I'm not a huge fan of crepes since I lean more towards crispy food than soggy, and I find crepes to usually be more of latter than former. The shake was also delicious.  You could taste a slight hint of the coffee, as it was not overpowering.  It was not thick at all, though, and more like melted ice cream.  I would have preferred it to have more of a shake consistency, which it did not at all.  \n\nPrices are pretty steep here but the desserts are more than enough for at least two people.  It's a great place to go for anyone with a sweet tooth.  The chocolate was also very good!  We had wanted to dry one popsicle dessert, but the waitress said they've been out of it for two months.

I mean it was good don't get me wrong, but not the best I tried. Soon half way in the meal I bite on some seasoning, they had in the mac and cheese, and I hated it. I have tasted this before in another meal once, and I don't know what it is! I changed my mind as I was eating it and instend of ok..it was now bad because of that one little seasoning. I just stopped eating and hurried to check the menu for a drink, they could get the taste out of my mouth because it makes me sick to my stomach. \n\nI got a cookie shake to go that cost $7.75.\nThat was the best part of this whole meal was that shake! It was soo good! It had white chocolate cream and Oreo cookies! I would come back just for that shake! \n\nI think this place was decent. I just picked the wrong meal for me.  If I come back, I will try something with less ingredients. \n\nMy whole meal was about $25.00, and that's not including the tip, and that was just for one individual. If you arrive with friends and family, you know where the price will be."

Our server (Desiree, according to my receipt) was so friendly and helpful. And the food--not to mention its presentation--was amazing (for the most part).\n\nI came with two friends and we got two apps/sides to share:\n1. Molly's White Corn Croquettes: house seasoned white corn & manchego cheese balls dusted in panko bread crumbs & lightly fried\n-- OMG I loved these! I tasted mostly cheese and only a hint of corn, but that was fine with me! We got the full order (8 croquettes) and it comes on a long glass dish that has grooves for each of them. They are nested on top of a bed of chili mayo sauce and MAN, that sauce is mmmm delicious!\n2. Waffle Fries Dusted with Chili and Cocoa Power\n-- These didn't blow me away, but they also came with the mmmm delicious chili mayo sauce which complimented it perfectly. I mean, I love fries of all kinds, so I loved these waffle fries, but I feel like I love the sauce even more...\n\nAs for entrees:\n1. Keri W. got the Cande's Killer Breakfast Skillet: farm fresh eggs, sausage, onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, spinach, home fries & mushrooms seasoned and scrambled together served with a house baguette\n-- I only tried a little bit, but it was good. She really liked her dish. It came with a small side bowl of butter and one of chocolate. She's a traditionalist and loves her bread with butter, but when she tried it with the melted chocolate... she didn't go back.\n2. GH got the Chocolate Chunks Pizza (half-size): Max's double chocolate melting chunks & a choice of 2: crunchy hazelnut bits, bananas, peanut butter or roasted marshmallows; she chose bananas and marshmallows since I'm allergic to nuts\n-- Looking at the pictures, I kind of wish we had gotten \"The Works\", but that would have been much too much! I ate 1/2 of a slice and that was more than enough for me. It was too chocolate-y! And very sticky in the mouth. I gave GH my pecans and she said that helped, but she wondered how sticky it would be if someone ordered peanut butter! :P Anyway, it is because of this dish that GH also agrees that Max Brenner gets 4 instead of 5 stars. We both really did not like the crust. We were told it was a \"thin crust\" so we were thinking the nice crispy thin crust pizza-esque crusts... but this was like thick pita bread. Didn't like it. So glad I did not order this.\n3. So what did I get? The Cinnamon Apple & White Chocolate Truffle Cream French Toast: brown sugar spiced pecans, warm toffee sauce (obviously got the pecans on the side)\n-- I love cinnamon, apples, white chocolate, and french toast. So guess what? I LOVED this dish! It was a bit heavy, but also quite a bit heavenly ;)\n\nGH also got the Mexican Spicy Hot Chocolate (red chili, nutmeg, cinnamon and pepper) and she greatly enjoyed it. And I think it's so cute that it comes in the Hug Mug! Adorbs.\n\nBut now that I've read Misti Y.'s review, I have to come back! I want to try their BALT since I love love love avocadoes, and she also makes their lemonade granita sound amazing. And, of course, so many other items on their menu sound like must-try's as well..."

Since we were at a place dedicated to chocolate, we had to order one of their specialty drinks!  So we got the Italian thick hot (dark) chocolate.  I've never had a richer smoother creamier hot chocolate...it was like a quality dark chocolate bar in liquid form.  Amazing and very addicting!  It comes in this innovative mug that has a tear-shaped opening so that there is a tip/spout that you drink from -- I assume it prevents a mess from being created?  \n\nAnd their food was also really good! We shared the pita chips (warm toasted/crispy outside, soft chewy inside = DELICIOUS!) with the eggplant dip, chicken tenders, spicy tuna salad sandwich, and the banana tempura fondue.  Watch out for the banana tempura...it's not really made with tempura batter (it's more fine and grainy, but still crispy) and the banana lump inside is very soft and creamy, and not the usual firmer banana texture you might expect. Everything was still very much beyond what we expected and their portions were generous (kinda spoiled our dinner later! haha).  We were thoroughly impressed.  And to top things off, we didn't know it was restaurant week in Las Vegas, so the pita chips, sandwich, and banana tempura were together only $20.11.  What a steal!\n\nThe service could have been more pleasant and personable, but maybe it was just an off-day.  We will likely return to try more of their menu items...and more chocolate stuff of course!  Oh there's even a small shop in the restaurant that sells their chocolate treats =)"

We had 6pm reservations and even though we were almost a half hour early the hostess was happy to seat us.  The first thing you notice here is the smell of melting chocolate throughout the dining room.  There is nothing wrong at all with that. Most of the drinks and at least half of the food at Max's has a chocolate component to it. With that in mind Simone and I started the meal with two of the most amazing Drinks I may have ever had. My drink was the Berry Nutty Professor, a quirky drink take on the Classic PBJ sandwich, consisting of Peanut Liquor, Frangelico, Chombroid and Milk Chocolate. It was smooth, sweet and creamy and unbelievably good. Not to be outdone by my drink, Simone ordered a Satisfaction Guaranteed and it was completely satisfying. Peanut Liquor, Caramel Liquor and Milk Chocolate, served in a glass on a bed of crushed Ice with a flask refill on the side. Even though my drink was amazing, I still couldn't help but steal some sips of hers. For our food we started with White Corn Croquettes. Spicy seasoned sweet white corn kernel's are mixed with creamy Manchego cheese and coated with Panko Breadcrumbs then lightly fried to a perfect crispiness. They did not come with a dipping sauce and they did not need it as they were great all by themselves. Next we split in order of Mac and Cheese and at the suggestion of our waiter we added grilled chicken to it. Although not my favorite of all time ( that honor belongs to Yardhouse) it was definitely one of the better ones I have had. Tomato Bruschetta and Bacon is combined with a 5 cheese blend and grilled chicken then baked with a light bread topping. This was smoky flavored with a bit of sweetness due to the tomato. It was not as creamy and rich as expected with five cheeses but it was still overall very flavorful and delish. It came with a side of marinara that I thought was a bit pointless but I gave it a try on top of the Mac and Cheese and it wasn't to bad but also didn't really add anything to the dish. Last up was dessert and of course we had to have something with chocolate. We choose what sounded like the most satisfyingly decadent choice on the menu. A Chocolate Chunk dessert Pizza with the works ( marshmallows, peanut butter, chocolate, banana's, and hazelnut nibs). Unfortunately it was not as yummy as I dreamed it might be. The dough was not a crispy pizza dough but some strange spongy pita bread wannabe. The chocolate itself was lost in the dish with all the other toppings. This was actually a surprising disappointment to end our meal. For a place known for chocolate I was expecting so much more.  Overall the meal was very good and the drinks exceptional but the dessert disappointed me leaving me no choice but to give three stars to Max Brenners."

            "review": "I like their dark hot chocolate! But just the dark hot chocolate. The rest of items that we tried were just ok. The rest were chicken wings (I forgot the name but it wasn't the one with nuts on it), a shake and the popsicle fondue. I think the chicken wings got honey on top of it so it's sweet......which was not good. I have sweet tooth but I want my savory food not sweet. So it was a bummer. I think the shake is called the 80's shake. It has dark chocolate (menu said milk choco but I asked them to change it to dark), vanilla ice cream and chocolate shell. I though everything is blended in the shake but when it came, it's actually a dark chocolate shake or granita, with a scoop of ice-cream on top, and the chocolate shell is on the ice-cream. So the execution was a bit not what we expected, and not appealing to us. Lastly, the popsicle fondue was way way way too sweet. The popsicle is made of vanilla ice-cream, which is sweet already. Then chocolate for dipping is milk chocolate which was way way way too sweet and passed the point of being yummy....I meant the dip wasn't yummy at all. And there was ground pistachio nuts and wafer balls for dipping to make it even more sweet. Don't get me wrong, I like sweet but only to its optimum level. I think it's a disaster when they make things above the optimum point. \n\nMy husband got freaked out by the sweet chicken wings and doesn't want to try other savory items there again. I think we will go back only for the dark hot chocolate. Why? It's not too sweet, but has the real chocolate flavor, and not too bitter or sour. Some dark chocolate is very bitter and sour, but not the case for their hot dark chocolate. I like chocolate not because of its sweetness, but its distinctive aroma. When you make chocolate too sweet, that aroma will be masked and all you are tasting is just sugar, not chocolate."

At first, we had plans to go elsewhere, but after tasting the samples, we gave it a go for dinner.\n\nThe restaurant itself is really cool and reminds me of Willy Wonka's Chocolate factory with brown decor everywhere, and pools of chocolate mixing in the front and a tiny shop to the side. Just so happens that Mr. Brenner was heavily influenced from watching the movie to become a chocolatier, but that's beside the point.\n\nWe were seated in front and got to watch samples be given and shot into customer's throats, literally. It was funny. They have these chocolate syringes that cost about $5 and other little goodies such as cookie shakes and those lovely pralines to die for that they sell in front to reel 'em in. It worked.\n\nWell, as for dinner food, I ordered the Asparagus Crepe and my DH, the Sesame-crusted Salmon, my 2-yr. old got the Crunchy Mac & Cheese w/ marinara in a syringe w/ a side of cheese (?). His was fairly decent, not out of this world. Mine plain sucked. I only ate half as it was pretty tasteless and barely had any asparagus w/ mainly cheese and spinach which made it all soggy. I however, adored my child's dish (which she barely ate and instead took my waffle fries) It was one of the best Mac&Cheese dishes I've ever had in a restaurant, crunchy on top, gooey inside, and just that right amount of sharp taste i like w/ the asiago cheese. The marinara complemented the dish well. \n\nNow, desserts are what had me give the 4 stars, (minus the one for the meals themselves). We ordered the combo w/ the Lava Cake, Chocolate shot, and ice cream w/ a side of chocolate sauce. For his b-day, they gave this measly piece of chocolate w/ a little tealight. (I was cool w/ that considering they had just opened and were very nice to us). The cake was awesome along w/ the ice cream which helped out the heaviness of the cake. The shot was very good but for me, that chocolate sauce killed it for me. I could have drank that whole cup alone despite it being a \"sauce\". It was like a melted milk chocolate bar! I swear. \n\nSo overall, we were pretty satisfied w/ our experience as customer service went over and beyond to treat us well being it's first day. We asked the server if Mr. Brenner was there, and as we were walking out they whispered \"He's over there in the striped shirt in the back.\"  We saw the bald headed man and wished we had sat longer as he was greeting guests when we left. Hopefully they can work on the regular food, but of course the desserts will remain the star of the show. I would totally not mind if it was solely a chocolate dessert shop as I have a feeling the restaurant part may not go well. That's just a prediction since it just opened. \n\nRecommendations: \n-DESSERT-that's what we'll go back for to try from the multitude of selections they had. \n-The Chocolate Shop-too tiny but so cool. Pricey but worth it. TRY the Chockies and the different Pralines. Our favorite was the Pecan and Almond. The Hazelnut was so-so.\n\nFor all you Chocolholics, it will be quite an experience."

Upon arriving at the restaurant which is located inside Ceasars Palace, I noticed a bold decoration on the interior and a nice setup outfront in which they called the patio. While the menu is extensive, it has a fairly confusing layout. After browsing, I ordered the individual portion of the Molly's white corn croquette. It came in six pieces - a perfect size for lil ol' me. This isn't exactly a healthy item nor overwhelmingly delicious but I enjoyed them just fine. \n\nI also asked for the Mocha madness and the Surprise Tiramisu. Both of these items came in little glass cups with tiny flasks filled with chocolatey liquid. The tiny flasks reminded me of the flasks I used to use for chemicals while working in a radiochemistry lab and that brought back unpleasant memory. Despite that fact, I bet some people find these items cute or whimsical. I thought that the Mocha Madness had the perfect amount of kahlua and sweetness, especially if you're an Asian who can't hold an ounce of alcohol to save her life. As for the Tiramisu, the white cream sauce was outrageously sweet I couldn't eat more than half a teaspoon and just gave up on it. Instead, I poured the chocolate flask onto the strawberry cup and really enjoyed the chocolatey fruit. I wouldn't recommend this Tiramisu item if you don't like overly sweet desserts.\n\nOverall, I was a little bit disappointed at the chocolate items at Max Brenner. Chocolate desserts don't have to be overly sweet to be good. A good dessert must have a balance of everything and not be overpowered by a single component, which in this case is sugar."

The focus of my visit was purely on the hot chocolate. The edible ordered was originally viewed as only an incidental to me, and only being added for nourishment. Hence, why I chose to pair my salted caramel hot chocolate with the (gigantic) fruit parfait.\n\nI really believed the parfait would be watery Yoplait with a couple strawberries and stale granola, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. The base was a very thick Greek style yogurt, the mixture of berries had a beautiful aroma of orange and honey, and the topping of dark chocolate shavings was a fun and well paired addition. It was a wonderful breakfast which didn't fill me up so much that I couldn't enjoy my hot chocolate. Possibly a smart choice for you as well if you'd like to enjoy one of Max Brenner's sweet sippables without being sickeningly full afterwards.\n\nMy salted caramel hot chocolate was to die for. That amazing little \"hug mug\" of rich, creamy, and dreamy drink had me almost falling out of my chair. Perfection in a mug. The chocolate was intense, but not even slightly bitter, the caramel was not even close to cloying, rather it was buttery and nutty, and the salt was gentle and balanced out the sweetness of the proceeding. To say the least, I was very satisfied with this as my morning treat, and I was very, very happy to finally be experiencing it.\n\nSo, the savory options at Max Brenner tend to run all over the rating scale, but I can tell you all that you're safe with the hot chocolate if nothing else. It's raved about for a reason. If you have the good graces enough to get a mug for yourself, expect to be warmed body and soul with every sip."

            "review": "My husband and I actually made a reservation for lunch here since every restaurant we seemed to walk in to for lunch or dinner had an hour and a half wait. We went on a Wednesday at 1 pm and there was hardly anyone in there. I love chocolate so I couldn't wait to try this place. I will say up front that I did not end up getting dessert because of what I ordered to eat and because of the service so I wanted to get out of there.\n\nFirst off, the service was super slow and since there were hardly any other people there, it was surprising. Also, the hostess sat us at the closest table to the entrance which I thought was not cool since we went out of our way to make reservation. After we placed our drink our orders (iced tea and a beer - not a frou frou mixed drink) I asked where the restroom was. Some waitress said theirs was broken so I had to go use one out in the mall. No problem, but later I overheard a woman ask another person where the restroom was and she told her it was upstairs. So, were the toilets not broken or did you just happen to fix them in the next 20 minutes?\n\nSo back to the awesome table we were placed at. After we had our drinks, a group of people came a plopped down right next us and sat there and talked about how hungover they were and how tired they were with no intention of ordering anything. This girl literally sat on top of me while I was looking at the menu. The hostess even came over and asked if they were going to order anything or if they were \"hanging out\". They replied they were just hanging out and had no intention of ordering food or drinks and the hostess decided that was perfectly fine. The group of people decided to move on eventually but that's when I asked to move to a table away from the entrance and not in the \"I'm not a paying customer, I'm just gonna hang out\" zone. Our waitress was really nice and accommodating and moved us to a table slightly further away near the bar.\n\nLike I said, I did not get dessert but I did order the Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes. I figured a meal and dessert in one and that's exactly what I got so there was no need to order more dessert. My husband ordered the Lazy Breakfast where you get 2 eggs and 2 \"add-ins\" and a biscuit dusted with sugar and chocolate dipping sauce. The add-ins he requested were tomatoes and bacon. Apparently that meant loads of cheese as well. My husband can't eat cheese so he had to send it back. Once again, the waitress was super nice and apologetic and I think she threw in some chorizo as a bonus when they redid his food. The other redeeming quality of this experience was that the waitress comped his meal for getting it wrong.\n\nIf we went back, I would just go for dessert and skip the food. Ask to sit at the bar or away from the entrance because at the end of the day, this place is in a mall and people are going to treat it like they are stopping at the food court and apparently, there is no problem with that. Paying customers are not treated any better than people who want to take a load off inside the restaurant and text their friends. I expected more from the reviews that I read previously but I was pleased that at least the waitress had the thought to comp my husband's meal when she didn't have to do that."

            "review": "This review is not about their food, we didn't even make it that far. The one star is for their policy against sharing. \n\nWe went to the Caesars for Restaurant week knowing there would be many restaurants there participating. My group consisted of 2 adults and a child. None of us were particularly hungry so we ordered one lunch off the Restaurant week menu and a mac and cheese. The waitress said that we could not share so I told her we were not going to share. After talking to her manager she came back to question what my boyfriend would be eating and after he responded that he would just be nibbling off mine she again told us there was a strict no sharing policy and that sharing would not be allowed. So we went to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill instead where they had no policy against sharing.\n\nI was very disappointed with Max Brenner and do not understand the purpose of such policy.  Isn't the primary point of Restaurant Week to support fighting hunger in Las Vegas? The policy feels like they are primarily using Restaurant week to help themselves. In addition, we went during brunch and the restaurant wasn't even busy."

            "review": "You will never encounter better chocolate. It's as simple as that.\n\nI made reservations for two for January 8th, 2011 at 3pm, which is Brunch. I made these reservations as a Christmas gift to my mother who is the ULTIMATE chocolate aficionado. We arrived at 2:30 without even having realized we were a half an hour early, and they still instantly seated us. \n\nI researched this restaurant quite a bit before deciding to go there, even though I have friends in New York who rave about this place. I was worried about it being really cramped, loud, busy, and too upscale or snobby for my taste. It definitely wasn't. Every single employee was abundantly friendly and helpful. The setup in the restaurant was very adorable and decently spaced. My only complaints would be that the table we sat at was a bit tiny and wobbly, as well as the chair wasn't all that comfortable. Our waiter was a younger man who was very witty and helpful and didn't complain when we gave asked him \"which is better?\" about several dishes. \n\nFor starters, my mother and I both ended up ordering the Eighties Milkshake ($8) as our primary beverage and were also brought glasses of ice water. It's served in a tall freezing porcelain glass with a steel straw, which is brilliant. The Eighties Milkshake is a combination of milk chocolate ganache and  vanilla bourbon ice cream which is topped with a chocolate 'shell'. This milkshake is HEAVEN. You immediately taste the bourbon in the icecream and how creamy and delectable it is. If you take a drink and bite off a piece of the shell, you enter an alternate universe of tastyness. No milkshake tops how simple but amazing this one is. I can't wait to go back and have another one.\n\nFor brunch I ordered the B.A.L.T. ($14) which is a Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato sandwich with avocado slices and a cilantro-avocado mayonnaise. I ordered it with pepper jack cheese (+$1). This sandwich was to die for. It's served on white bread with the crusts cut off and is skewered. It is mindblowing. The bacon was perfectly cooked, the sandwich was perfectly put together, and it tasted fabulous. I was worried that because it's a somewhat fancy restaurant that the portions would be small and that I wouldn't get enough bang for my buck, but I was wrong. There's two skewered stacks of the sandwich (one on each side of the dish), with two pickle spears in the center, and a small bowl of about 5 waffle fries with the dipping sauce. The waffle fries are incredible, though I wish there were more. They're perfectly crispy and dusted with cocoa powder and chili powder to give a very mild accent and a very mild kick. The dipping sauce is sensational and definitely has a punch to it. It tastes like a horseradish-tangy-southwestern sauce with a bit of chili powder on top. It compliments the waffle fries very well.\n\nMy mother ordered the Grilled Chicken Panini ($14) and it was exquisite. The Grilled Chicken Panini is a panini with grilled chicken, olive pesto, tomato, spinach, and goat cheese. The chicken was cooked beautifully, the bread was exceptional, the olive pesto gave the panini the perfect amount of saltiness and earthyness, the spinach and the tomato were excellent additions, and the goat cheese completely brought it all together. \n\nFor our much awaited dessert, we ordered the \"Sharing For Two\" ($25) off the Sweet Icons dessert menu. This dish comes with a few squares of chocolate sponge cake which are melt-in-your-mouth perfect, a crispy chocolate eggroll that is stuffed with fudge and bananas and drizzled with caramel, and two bars of \"bark\" (milk chocolate and white chocolate) which are a crunchy bar made of what I'm guessing is rice krispy and chocolate. The dish also features 1/4th of a waffle topped with icecream, carmelized bananas, and rice krispy crumble. Last but not least, the Sharing comes with a fondue set; complete with a fire grill, candle-warmed liquid chocolate fondue of your choice (milk, dark, or white), and a bowl of bananas, marshmallows, and strawberries. Oh and did I mention that your entire dish is garnished with the perfect amount of powdered sugar? You can't go wrong with this dessert. It's everything that a dessert should be. \n\nMax Brenner's has instantly become one of my favourite places to dine and I will surely be going back time and time again."

My favorite was the Walnut Chocolate Chip...it's definitely one of the best cookies I've ever had.  These were $10 each and even though it arrived with whipped cream, chocolate sauce and a mixed fruit and mint side, it still was very pricey. \n\nWe also tried their sundaes -  I had a dessert with chocolate ice cream sandwiched between two chocolate cookies and it arrived with a rich milk chocolate dipping sauce.  It was very good and decadent.  The other sundae ordered was a chocolate peanut butter one with lots of great chocolate flavor and peanut butter goodness.\n\nThis was definitely a splurge, but I enjoyed it.  The next time I'm in LV, I'd definitely come back here , but I'd go to the outside/\"to-go\" stand and order the Walnut Chocolate Chip Cookies, which are only $5...those cookies were extremely impressive.   \n\nOverall, everything here was great...the price point seems just too high to me, even for being that good...definitely worth a try, though."

I ordered the panini because I was eager to try the waffle fries sprinkled with cocoa and chili powder; once again, the fries were fine - but I failed to notice anything  special about them. \nThe  reason we went to Brenner's was for the hot chocolate. We tasted all around the Italian w/ dark chocolate, the whipped chocolate (also the dark chocolate), the white chocolate and the Melting Marshmallow with dark chocolate. The favorite was the Melting Marshmallow, the least favorite was the white chocolate. I tasted each with the exception of the whipped chocolate. I would gladly order any of the dark chocolate drinks again; I am a sucker for thick hot chocolate and the Italian was exactly that; albeit a little sweeter than I prefer. For my buck the best flavor was the Melting Marshmallow. The two who ordered the white chocolate were sorry they had done so.\nThe service was poor as the waitress would disappear for long stretches. We ordered the hot chocolate before the meal (we didn't want to take the chance that we wouldn't have room for hot chocolate). We ordered the meal and 20 minutes later the food arrived and we had to ask for water glasses. I had ordered a soft drink with my meal, and it never came.

(Oops, I almost said the \"W\" word - prolly a big no-no here). Our server was super nice & answered our questions about items on the menu.\n\nBlack & Tan Beer Battered Vidalia Onion Rings - large & bready, I could really taste the beer in the batter, not awesome, but just good. This came with a chocolate-ranch dipping sauce, which I didn't really care for (plain ranch would have been fine).\n\nWaffle Fries - dusted with chili & cocoa powder, though I didn't really taste much of it. They were hot, crispy & had enough salt to make them very tasty. This came with a light, tangy dipping sauce, that went well(er) with the 'rings too.\n\n(me) Huevos Rancheros Sunrise Burrito $13.75 - light, fluffy scrambled eggs, spicy-hot chorizo, tomato & pepper jack cheese. Giant sized, wrapped in a festive bright-red tortilla & served with salsa, sour cream & a side of homestyle fries. This was really good, really spicy & filling.\n\n(b-day girl) Guilt Free Omelet $13.75 - mushrooms, spinach, onions, peppers, tomato & Swiss cheese. Served with a sugar dusted buttermilk biscuit, home fries, sour cream & chocolate sauce on the side. Though I didn't sample this dish, b-day girl liked it. \"Mmm, that's good\" (that's what she said).\n\nChocolate Chai $4.50 - served do-it-yourself style, set it on your glass & it pours the Chai spiced Hot White Chocolate Truffle right in. This was so good, both the Chocolate & Chai flavors were really intense.\n\nMocha Frapp\u00e9 $7.50 - Milk Chocolate Truffle & Espresso Shot served in a very cool ceramic \"Alice In Wonderland\" inspired cup with a stainless steel straw. This is, the best & most chocolatey tasting frapp\u00e9 I have ever had, chocolate-bar none!\n\nThe Kids Menu reads like a children's storybook. The first chapter all about sweets. A little strange, with names like \"Chocolate Burger\" & \"Chocolate Pizza\", but it turns out - they're made entirely of sweets, not some bizarre concoctions inspired by pregnant cravings. Chapter 2 offers more traditional food, with fun & interesting names like \"The Bowl Scribble Little Mouth Cheeseburgers with flying saucer french fries & ketchup paint\" $8.50. My son really enjoyed these 2 skewered sliders & waffle fries, but opted not to have the \"paint.\" He was a little weirded-out by the names, I guess. It's served with a fun little brush to paint on the ketchup.\n\nWe browsed the 50+ items on the dessert menu throughout our meal, but sadly, were way too full to try any of them afterward. Why did I wait 'til the last day of our trip, to come here? I was at a loss, like going to 31-Flavors & only having enough time to try the plain vanilla, loss. Next time for sure.\n\nOverall, I thought the food & service was good. A little pricey (it's The Forum Shops - wha'd ya expect?), but the amazing Chocolate here, is well worth the visit."

The servers at this place were extremely helpful in showing me the different types of chocolate products they would recommend to me....I swear if I stayed in the store any longer I would have gone broke trying to buy everything in site....all the taste test they have given me was beyond my expectations as to how well the chocolate was developed here.  In the end I only got a frozen hot chocolate to compare to Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate....by far it is way better than Serendipity!  I promise these guys that my wife and I will come back next time we are in Vegas and have a sit down session with the chocolate fondue.\n\nFor those who read this, I promise you that you will not be disappointed when you try their chocolate and if you think other wise and claim Godiva is better like some ignorant taste testers, you do not deserve high quality chocolate.....stick to your Hersheys! :p"

I was surprised that the place was not packed at all.\n\nOur server was very helpful, we were overwelmed by a lot of dessert choices and we couldn't decide what to get. Beau, our server recommend their infamous fondue-- where we can sample 6 different dessert and dip 'em on our choice of melted chocolate.\nSo we got that and the hazelnut shake that they serve on their Alice cup.\nEverything was chocolaty and serving size was just right. No left over for us! Lol\n\nWe enjoyed our first time here and would definitely come back to try their food choices and of course more of their chocolaty goodies. A must try when you are in the area.\n\nFive star for great service and yummy dessert!\n\nOver all, this is a pretty nice place to indulge yourself with sweets once in a while.\n\nxoxo"

So delicious!  \n\nBeyond that, the bartender barely made any conversation and was so flustered with running around that we felt ignored.  It took 20-ish minutes for us to get our milkshake/hot chocolate and then another 10 for me to get my smores dessert.  \n\nI just wasn't impressed at all with this place, but I gave it three stars anyway because a chocolate restaurant in itself is a GREAT concept!

One was available for $24 worth of food for dine in only - the cost was $12.  After reading reviews, I was very excited to go, although the Groupon was restricted to 1 per table (there were going to be 4 of us in my party).\n\nThe Saturday I was in LV, the restaurant closed at 12.30am, and we got there at 12am.  Our server, Ryan, was nice, but I was trying to determine whether he was slightly annoyed that we came in so close to closing time.  After he gave us menus, then returned to see if we had any questions - it took asking so many questions to get some information out of him on what was good, etc.  At one point I felt bad asking so many questions - but if you're not forthcoming with information and we're overwhelmed - what do you expect?!  Anyhow, we finally settled on the Profiterole Fondue, an Apple Waffle and 2 Apple Crisps (pics coming soon).\n\nAfter all the drama from perusing the menu and trying to decide, everyone in my party was spectacularly impressed!  The serving sizes were plenty for 1 person (could even be shared with 2), the flavors were decadent, and the chocolate was as perfect as I could imagine.  I had the fondue, and couldn't even finish it all because it was so rich.  Don't get grossed out, but it was so rich, I thought I might get sick at one point if I took another bite...and I still wanted to it was so good!\n\nWe were celebrating a birthday, so once we determined we could eat no more - Ryan brought out a tiny plate with a candle and a square of chocolate - a nice touch!  With the $24 Groupon, the bill came to a little over $50 - so it's a pricey place, but worth a once-in-a-while visit.\n\nOne bonus of being the last customers - another server asked us if we liked cookies.  Of course we said yes, and she she then brought each of us one of the large chocolate cookies that they were going to toss.  They were so thick, and they were warm!  We all decided to take them on the plane with us the next day, and I was so glad I did.  It was de-li-cious!\n\nAll in all, I was very happy I discovered this place.  I've been to a chocolate bar before in DC - but it can't compare....Max Brenner is simply the bomb.  Oh and the decor was so fun!  In the ladies room, the mirror had some writing on it that said something like \"you look extremely good today\"....how nice :)"

Before that I was here for a CMYE event here, and sampled a selection of their hot menu items and chocolatebeverages.\n\nBased on the Yelp reviews,on my first visit, I ordered the B.A.L.T. sandwich and an Apple Pie Cinnamon Waffles (white chocolate cream, vanilla crepe flake ice cream, candied pecans) for dessert.  On my second visit, I sat at the bar and ordered the Brenner Burger and upgraded it to Pure AmericanKobe Beef, a Hot Dark Chocolate drink, and ended my lunch with a Butterscrotch Chocolate Cream Milkshake (dulce de leche ice cream, toffee sauce, pure milk chocolate).\n\nThe B.A.L.T. sandwich was good, but I thought there would be more avocado.  Otherwise, it was tasty and pretty easy to make at home if you are so inclined. The best part is the waffle fries.\n\nApple Pie Cinnamon Waffles - one of their composed desserts.  I have a sweet tooth, but even this was a little too much sugar for me.  The waffles was okay, and for me the best part of this dessert was the 2 oz scoop of vanilla ice cream and the warmed and dilluted condense milk that you can pour over the everything.\n\nThe Brenner Kobe Burger was very good.  And was also served with those waffle fries.  It was juicy, has a good flavor, and I totally recommends this.  Can get a little messy eating this, but nothing a good wipe on the napkins or a little soap and water will not fix up.\n\nThe Hot Chocolate (Dark Chocolate) was served in the \"hug me\" mug, which I thought would be bigger, but the hot chocolate was served in a cup sized \"mug\" but has rich chocolate flavor.  Worth a try, if you love chocolate.\n\nButterscrotch Chocolate Cream Milkshake - a sweet milkshake perfect for the sweet tooth.  But it is not a unique dessert concept that you can't find anywhere else.  But it hit the spot for me and was a yummy conclusion to a good lunch.\n\nThe waitstaff were all very friendly and attentive. 4/5\n\nDecor - 4/5\n\nFood is average to good. 3.5/5\n\nPrice - relatively inexpensive by casino restaurants standards.  3.5/5\n\nSo almost 4 stars, but it gets there by rounding up. :)"

Only here, only here.\n\nAfter a night out and a long day of sleeping in, my friends and I were at starvation central and there was no better place to get our not-quite-hungover-but-not-quite-back-to-normal butts fed. At around 2 pm on a Wednesday afternoon, this place was CROWDED. I'm not sure if you can make reservations, but I'd consider making them, esp on the more popular days (Friday-Sunday).\n\nAnyway, after vacillating, I finally decided on the kobe burger. A short wait later, my friends and I got our food. The mac and cheese is HUGE. I would suggest splitting. My friend's steak panini and my burger were more true-to-size. \n\nThe burger was DELISH and would recommend to any meat lovers up in this hizzouse. The mac and cheesy was as promised: so cheesy and so crunchy. \n\nOf course we couldn't leave without getting dessert. We decided on half of the chocolate chunks pizza and we went big: we went with \"the works.\" The pizza had crunchy hazelnut bits, bananas, peanut butter, and roasted marshmallows. The pizza was a bit heavy on the peanut butter so if you're not a peanut butter fan, I'd do the pick your own two toppings instead.\n\nI also got their mocha cause it comes in a hug mug and I'm nothing if not a sucker for cute packaging. Twas delish and man, I could go for another one of those babies. \n\nA must-do for chocoholics!!"

I didn't dine in, but did get their $5 double chocolate chip cookie. I'm not a huge cookie fan, but this was delicious! It was a big cookie jammed with tons of chocolate chips. But it wasn't overly sweet. It was soft, chewy, very chocolatey, and big enough to tide me over until dinner!\n\nThe small gift shop area was cute. Everything was so expensive, but what a chocoholic's dream come true! I hope to try their fondue or milkshakes next time! I could easily gain 5 lbs. from this place alone."

The Yelperazzi and I weren't sick of each other and did the HH after a Yelp event and shopping. \n\nI just wanted a small snack and got chili coco waffle fries. It was perfectly crispy and the seasoning on it was tasty. I wouldn't say it screams \"this is chocolate\" but just a hint of cocoa flavor and has a more smoky savory flavoring from the seasoning and the chipotle mayo it comes with. I saw they also do chocolate ranch dressing so I asked for a bit to try. It was a good ranch, but that really didn't taste like chocolate at all. \n\nI got my order not put in or something despite being one of the first to order and while waiting they gave me a extra mini philly. They made too much apparently. Those were really surprisingly delicious. I didn't think I had room for it, but I made room. I have to come back for that again. Two come to a order and theres a small paper cone with a tiny bit of waffle fries between them. When I mean little, I mean like 2-3 for a taste. \n\nEveryone seemed to all enjoy their food and cocktails. Service was good and friendly from the bartender. \n\nI've had their savory food once during a Yelp event (one of the best ones we've ever had, BTW) and definitely coming back for a meal and happy hour. Just a tip that the bar seating isn't plentiful, so it might be hard for a large group unless you come right when it starts as it usually is empty otherwise. \n\nI recommend to try out having a meal and dessert here as their food is rather solid all around.\n\n(Yelp 100 Challenge 14/100)"

After taking a closer look at their menu displayed in the front, we discovered they serve food too! Finally ate here a few days ago....\n\nI loved the layout of this restaurant, it really felt like sitting in a chocolate factory! There were big jars on the walls filled with pieces of chocolate, crates on the floor filled with cocoa beans, pipes on the ceiling with flowing chocolate, etc. \n\nMy husband and I came in for a light lunch. We ordered:\n\nMax's Pizza - Meaty, Crispy, Cheesy & More: not really a fan of thin pizzas, but this was great! Very tasty, can't go wrong with pepperoni and bacon, which are my two favorite pizza toppings! I also liked how they cut it into bite sized pieces.\n\nSouthwestern Caesar Salad with Chicken (individual size): I know this sounds boring, but this was THE BEST Caesar Salad I have ever eaten! Good quality lettuce, good grilled chicken, all the ingredients were cut small so it was easy to eat. Very tasty and loved the creamy Mexican Caesar dressing too!\n\nPure Chocolate Truffle Granita: they were giving out samples of this in the mall, we both liked it. It was thick, not overly sweet and came in a neat \"Alice Cup\" with a metal straw.\n\nService was okay. We didn't wait too long for our food. The waitress didn't seem too excited about her job though, maybe she was having a bad day? But she did take time to explain things on the menu and checked up on us a few times.\n\nI will definitely come back again to try their other drinks and desserts! The Chocolate Surprise Tiramisu sounds good. The waffle fries with chili and cocoa powder sound interesting too."

We've tried several items, both sweet and savory from their menu.  The prices are high at this restaurant, as one might expect, since it is owned by a celebrity chef and located in the Caesar's Forum Shops mall.  While tasty and high quality, the several savory items we've tried are not worth the high price.  We liked their mac and cheese (very cheesy with a crispy topping and yummy tomato sauce on the side).  Their chicken fingers and waffle fries were solid, but not quite as special as the mac and cheese.\n\nAs is Mr. Brenner's specialty, the desserts are the highlight here.  Three items stand out to us.  Our very favorite item here is a cocktail - the Satisfaction Guaranteed.  There are quite a few ingredients but it just tastes like chocolate.  Though not thick and creamy, the taste is purely, deliciously chocolatey.  The butterscotch shake is also decadent and amazing.  Their Italian hot chocolate is super rich and thick.  We love all the desserts that feature dark chocolate.\n\nThe atmosphere is very classy and make you expect great things to come out of the kitchen for you.  For the most part, they deliver.  The serving presentation is really fancy.  So many special little platters, jars, dishes, serving trays, \"potion\" bottles.\n\nWe've found that many dishes are hard to picture based on the descriptions on the menu (chocolate with chocolate and a side of chocolate).  The servers are very helpful in making suggestions and describing what everything looks/tastes like.\n\nWe much prefer this place over Sugar Factory and Jean Philppe (sp?)."

White corn anything is such a treat with all that sweetness. There was quite a thick layer of bread crumbs which I disliked but a minor complaint. \n\nThere were a few tables around us enjoying ice cream sundaes so I was immediately drawn to that. Sadly, there were only two sundae options and both consisted of peanut butter ice cream. I am not the biggest fan of peanut butter, but we still decided to order the Euphoria Peanut Butter Chocolate Fudge Sundae. The crunchy hazelnut bits were my favorite part. Be warned that half of our sundae was SO MUCH peanut butter flavor/stuff and the other half was not so much. Unfortunate for me, guess which side I was eating until I finally decided to say something, to which my boyfriend said \"wait, try this side!\" :(:( \n\nService was horrible. We literally sat there for what seemed like forever, while our waitress went to get our waters. After 10-15 minutes, I waved down another waiter who reluctantly took our order.

I would prefer this to be a bit thinner.... other than that... this is a sweet, chocolate-y dessert... it is a decadent dessert.... that would go really well with coffee or a glass of milk\n-  tempura banana fondue.... i like bananas and this was perfect... not greasy, not heavy... light and sweet but not overly sugary... and a really nice way to end a really great lunch\n\nBEVERAGES:\nThey have some fantastic adult libations on the menu... however because it was lunch time... we stuck to Peach iced tea which is really refreshing.... and I don't like Peach.  \nThe only drawback is that the Peach iced tea does NOT come with refills.  But the regular iced tea does... so I got the Peach iced tea to start and then had it refilled with regular.\n\nMenu: excellent\nThe RW menu was a good indicator of what this place offers.\nNow, I want to go back and try more.\n\nThe Store:\nLots of great gift ideas and Lots of yummy chocolate options... all different kinds of chocolate...dark, milk, white... with all kinds of different add-ins... plus milkshake and hot chocolate mixes.  \nIf you have a choco-holic that you need to find a gift for... this place has a plethora of unique and fabulous options."

This time around was different as I decided to come here for their Happy Hour at their Bar.\n\nIt's a pretty good deal with a lot of small bites and cocktails going for almost half off their regular menu prices.  And the hours are pretty flexible from 3pm-6pm and 9pm to closing.  I had a friend join me so it made it easier to try more of the food, which was a big help on my part because I was still kind of full from a buffet I had earlier in the day.\n\nWe ordered their Mini Philly Sliders and their Mini Brenner Burgers.  Both came with their famous Cocoa Powdered Waffle Fries.\n\nMini Philly Sliders\nhttp://bit.ly/11RtJxG\nHow can you not like steak and cheese in a small brioche roll.  Very tasty!!!

These didn't really wow me, but they were still good nonetheless. \n\nIt was my first time trying the Cocoa Powdered Waffle Fries and I thought it was pretty interesting.  I didn't have ketchup with it since I wanted to be able to taste the Cocoa.  The Cocoa was subtle and gave a hint of sweetness, but didn't overpower the Fries.\n\nFor my drink I went with Max's Famous White Russian.  \nhttp://bit.ly/SBW47c\nPretty good!  The warm white chocolate was pure and helped melt down the marshmellow into the drink.\n\nAnd since I was there, just for the fun of it, might as well pick up another \"Works\" Chocolate Pizza.  \nhttp://bit.ly/VjNZ9w\nHow can you not get one when it's almost half price?

These items are not cheap by any means, but you're essentially buying the best stuff around.\n\nLocated in the Forum shops in Caesars, Max Brenner was kind of difficult to get to, especially the day after running a marathon.

People have a certain pride in their workplace if they love it there, and will defend it to the death. I had a friend who worked at Max Brenner in the Forum Shops who always swore they had one of the best burgers she's ever eaten, which I would normally accept if this place wasn't known mostly for their chocolate. How can a dessert place actually have a decent enough burger for her to recommend to me?\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again, I hate going to Caesar's. This becomes even worse when I'm risking a burger meal at a place I have no confidence in. Brenner is located deep in the mall across from the old FAO Schwartz location which is now a completely loud and obnoxious multi-story H&M store. I know this well because I chose to sit in their outdoor 'patio' directly across from this insanity to people watch and take in the scenery. What I didn't think about when I made this request was the ridiculous music coming out of H&M, and is definitely something to think about if you come dine here. Your other option is to sit inside their restaurant which is fairly small and nice, but has the amazing smell of chocolate. The menu is very heavy on the dessert-influenced dishes from shakes to sweet breakfasts, but also has a variety of regular items including pizza, pastas, salads and sandwiches. Quite extensive actually, and I really want to come back to try some of the dessert items as I didn't have any room after my burger.\n\nThe Brenner Burger comes with Max's secret barbecue sauce, lettuce, tomato, cheddar and a Vidalia onion ring on top, with waffle fries dusted with chili and cocoa powder. It has a great buttery bun; a bit strong at first but quickly got lost in the flavors. The meat had good flavor, it was cooked almost too rare but was still good, although the overall temperature was very low. So low in fact, that my cheddar was barely melted. Isn't that one of the easier cheeses to melt? The onion rings were a bit undercooked as they were hard to bite through, and I ended up pulling them out of their fried ring sadly. I recently told someone that a perfectly cooked ring is easy to bite through leaving the rest intact; this wasn't the case. The barbecue sauce was sweet and good, but there was almost not enough of it as I felt myself longing for that bit of flavor occasionally. \n\nThe waffle fries were good, but they only give you like five of them in a tiny glass. The cocoa and chili powder are a great concept as a seasoning, but they were hardly noticeable. The aioli on the side was good; it was very sweet and I found myself using it for my burger and fries. The two pickle wedges were ok, but I couldn't finish both after eating the large burger.\n\nOverall this could have been a really good burger, but the cold temperature really took away from it. The $14.25 price tag is a bit steep, but I guess I need to take into consideration where I was sitting. Once you do that, it's about on par with some of the other Forum locations I've been to, but possibly not as good. The service was spotty too; my waitress was extremely friendly, but bused a table behind me for 5 minutes after taking drink order and disappeared for at least another 5+ minutes after taking my plate before bringing my check. I will point out that they were pretty quiet too. My friend was right to recommend this burger to me; it's really quite good, but I think it has some competition within the building."

I wish she would have!  \n\nThe nights were starting to get a little windy and chilly, so the hot chocolate was perfect in both taste and comfort!  I wish it were bigger, but I also realize that if it had been, I wouldn't have been able to eat even the little bit that I did have.\n\nOverall, all of the things we sampled (one appetizer, two entrees and a sundae) were great!  Each dish was artfully prepared balancing flavors and textures.  The corn croquettes were crunchy and creamy, sweet and spicy - just perfect!  \n\nThe S'mores Sundae... Wow!  We were stuffed when we ordered it, but you can't come to Max Brenner's and not do dessert!  We probably should have started with hot chocolate and the sundae and called it a night!  The melted marshmellow and chocolate ice cream together was amazing!  I'm not a fan of graham crackers, but again, the texture they brought to the sundae was perfect!\n\nYou have to go, just order desert first!!"

They were overcooked and the flavor wasn't too impressive. I much preferred the Mini Philly ($6 HH): Shaved Ribeye, 5 Cheese Blend, Caramelized Onions, and Roasted Pepper Mayo. These were good, much better than the burgers IMO. Great taste and the happy hour price of $6 was pretty good value!\n\nAnd of course...the chocolate! The Chocolate Chunks Pizza ($6 HH): Max's Double Chocolate Melting Chunks, Bananas, and Roasted Marshmallows (1/2 portion). This was super rich, chocolatey and tasty in each bite. It was almost too much for me...overwhelming chocolate amazingness! I also tried the \"Smores Concoction\" which was mind blowingly good! Loved the milk chocolate mousse, but it was so rich that I started getting a headache LOL.\n\nCheck it out if you need some serious diabetes training!\n\nA few pics of the goodies :"

She asked us to wait, which was fine but when another couple who made reservations as well checked in, she seated them before us! We were seated outside next to a large group. Our server was overly sarcastic and not so friendly. Onto the food... We ordered the penne pasta with chicken. It wasn't amazing. Ordered the heart truffle cake and shake and our server left before my boyfriend could finish the remainder of our dessert order! Tried to get his attention and he half-turned his head and said to us \"oh I hear you what do you want?\" as he turns back to multitask. Umm, kinda rude! So then a couple minutes later, the server comes to take away dirty utensils and give us new ones. He neglects to switch out my fork and I catch him before he leaves, handing him my fork and telling him it was dirty. He proceeds to give me a fork and says \"umm here's this one. I think that's clean, right?\" He then looks at the fork that I gave him and says \"oh those are just water stains!\" I tell him that I had used that one, and he blames me boyfriend saying that \"he said it was clean!\" WOW!!! NO WONDER THIS IS CLOSING DOWN ON SUNDAY!\n\nHOWEVER I must say that the hot chocolate I ordered makes up for some of the crappy experience! I was DIVINE! I love hug mugs! And I would totally come back and go thru the crappy wait and service all for that salted caramel white hot chocolate! Yum!!!"

Not much, but we wanted a dessert and figured that a place based entirely around chocolate would be a good choice. \n\nTo continue, the chocolate on the chocolate pizza may be the best chocolate I have ever had. The chocolate pizza has a sweet pizza dough covered with liquid milk and white chocolate. To be honest, I felt like the dough actually took a little bit away from the fantastic chocolate, mostly because the pizza dough isn't very soft. However, the chocolate was so good that it didn't matter. I would like to see a version of the pizza with a traditional, crunchy, thin crust. I can't wait to go back and try the other food, especially a Double Dark Chocolate Cookie. If you just want a sweet chocolatey dessert, I would recommend the Chocolate Syringe, which is a giant syringe filled with warm chocolate that you just squirt into your mouth. At $5.00, its a very reasonable, delicious dessert for the Vegas strip.\n\nAs for the service, the person helping us at the little stand outside was extremely friendly. They were able to answer all of our questions and seemed very knowledgable about all the items offered. \n\nIn conclusion, I will be back here when I'm back on the strip and it is definitely going on my list of favorites! I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area."

White chocolate, dark chocolate, milk chocolate and chocolate with all kinds of extras....I've seldom met a chocolate I didn't like.\n\nMax Brenner is serious about chocolate, serving his delicacies in ergonomic mugs molded to be held for maximum enjoyment and coffee cups with kangaroo pouches for chocolate. He even serves his French Fries with chocolate. That is my kind of guy!\n\nOur tummies were rumbling for savory food, so we started with macaroni and cheese and a pulled pork sandwich before diving in for dessert. The portions of both were generous and both were delicious. The mac and cheese is served with bacon and tomato and has the perfect crusty, crumbly layer on top. The pulled pork had a barbeque sauce that was just the right amount of sweet and the chili chocolate fries were the icing on the cake. Knowing that we were going to order copious amounts of dessert, we cut ourselves off early and ended up saving leftovers for lunch the next day. This was easy to do as the portions were large.\n\nWe had the fondue for dessert and it came with two choices of chocolate as well as caramel. We had been debating between traditional fondue and the option that included graham crackers for smores, so our server suggested adding graham crackers and voila, the best of both worlds!\n\nWe literally loved the white chocolate to the point that my husband actually scooped it out of the fondue pot and ate it solo, and the caramel in the middle made for perfect pairings with the fondue accompaniments (marshmallows, strawberries, bananas, brownies, chocolate chip cookies, etc.). I have to say that if he hadn't scooped up the last morsels, I probably would have!\n\nMax Brenner's story is fun (read it on the menus), the decor is whimsical and the food is great. It's definitely worth a stop, whether or not you have a sweet tooth, and will definitely earn you \"brownie points\" (Ba-dum-ching) if you happen to treat a friend or loved one who has one!"

The atmosphere was simple yet, modern and sophisticated and the service was spot on. \nBeing that I had heard so much about Max Brenner, I felt it was my duty to try some of his famous hot chocolate. So I decided on the Mexican hot chocolate having never had Mexican HC before. I loved it! It had a unique but delicious flavor with a slight kick at the end from the cayenne pepper. For my meal, I decided on something less sweet: The Rosen Deli smoked turkey crepe. It was an egg crepe with swiss cheese, turkey and mushroom inside with a salad on top that consisted of greens, bell peppers and mandarin oranges. The crepe would have been salty if it were not for that salad on top. It was also accompanied by some potato wedges that were seasoned with of all things, cocoa powder and other spices. They were very good. It was a tasty meal but after trying the Cinnamon apple pecan and white chocolate truffle french toast my friend had ordered, I was wishing I had ordered something sweet for my brunch. The french toast was amazing, by far one of the best french toasts I have ever eaten. Lucky for me that my friend only ate half and left me with the remainder. After brunch, we decided to look around at all the chocolates. We were given samples of the chocolate covered pecans which were delicious and I purchased a couple of chocolates to eat while wandering around Ceasars: The toasted coconut and a chocolate with whiskey in it. Both were very good although pricey. I did manage to find a good buy though. It came with two hug mugs (mugs specially designed to hug with your hands when drinking hot chocolate so your hands get warm, two saucers and a tin of hot chocolate all for 25.00. I thought it was not a bad price so I purchased it and plan on making that hot chocolate soon once I am done with the first few phases of my diet. So if you are in Vegas and looking for a decent Brunch, Max Brenner is a great place! Just make sure you order all sweets when you go. You will not regret it and will be in heaven!"

We were looking for a moderately priced dinner option as we were all watching our wallets to balance out the shopping and shows :) My friend raved about the restaurant, so away we went. We had a great time, and the food was fantastic. The perfect lead in to a great night. \n\nFast forward a year later, we are back in Vegas and have put this on our list for a must stop. We had lunch there yesterday, and we honestly were not at our best. We both seem to have picked up a bad cold and were fighting the symptoms. But determined to enjoy our vacation, we were going to go shopping and have a great lunch. Not wanting to splurge on crazy cocktails or $6 beers, I asked if there was any way I could get a Hot Toddy as I thought it would be the perfect tool to help in my fight against my headache and sore throat. She said they could absolutely make one for us, and would just charge for the tea ($1.95) and the shot (we went with brandy for $3.95). My friend ordered one too and we were delighted when we were both presented with the lovely pallets that were our drinks. A wooden board with a glass of hot water, tea bag, honey and a beaker with the shot so we could customize our drink. And we each got a powder sugar topped lady finger to complete the beautiful presentation. I was truly surprised at the effort that was put in for our simple request. \n\nI ordered the cobb salad and my friend had an omelet with side salad, both were very tasty. And while I enjoyed the food, it was the service that really made the experience grand. They were just so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure we had a lovely time (even explaining how to make one of the salads that had been taken off the menu that my friend had been looking forward to ordering). Our server even gave us some great recommendations on things to do on Fremont St and when we mentioned wanting to get a small piece of chocolate to end the meal, she gave us a coupon to the gift shop and a few recommendations. \n\nIt was such a lovely dining experience that had us feeling far better than when we arrived.

The problem is we had mediocre server and at split bill time she was put out and rude about the whole transaction.  I'll start with we were a group of 7 with separate payments.  I can guarantee that in a convention town, that is a common occurrence.  I am also quite familiar with the Micros POS and simplicity of splitting checks or multiple payments.  GRANTED, its a pain but seeing that the restaurant was 1/4 full, I highly doubt an extra 4 minutes was going to impact the server's overall tip for the shift.  Back to business, the automatic 18% was added to the bill to protect the server from bad tippers on big party...standard and totally fair.  Who protects the customer?  I had a problem with the service so adjusting the tip would have been my resolution.  Not the first time to have bad service on a big party, server is guaranteed their money and they can do what they want.  We had 2 glasses of wine for our whole party, so her average check charge per person was low.  I CLEARLY saw her giving more service to her table with bottles of wine...smart for the server (she raises her per check charge and in turn makes more of her set 18% gratuity) bad for the establishment because an experienced F/B customer gets bad service and writes an honest review.  I admit this is a rant but please see my review distribution, I give way more 4/5 stars then anything.\n\nManager resolution, come in again and we'll take care of you...great idea if I lived in Las Vegas.  I addressed my issue with the service, not the food, not the environment but the service.  Make us happy and adjust the 18%, simple psychology would say you can guarantee that server will do it again, she got her money!  \n\nBeware of the dog paw tattooed server!"

First off, for you chocolate lovers this is your mini Willy Wonka type store front you've been searching high & low for. Don't even bother with that overrated Serendipity outside Caesar's Palace. That place is a joke especially when you have this spot not too far away in walking distance. Second, if you order too much food off their regular menu, you may not have enough room to fully enjoy their sweet delicacies at the end. The food food was good but nothing spectacular. The quality of their chocolate is for sure up there and the dessert menu itself will blow you away. When we first sat down, we all reached for the dessert menu before the food menu. We spent most of the time looking it over back and forth.\n\nOff the bat, the d\u00e9cor of the place should stand out. Back in the day this store was actually a club that I visited once. I'm glad that they got rid of that and Max Brenner took over its spot. A little trendy, lots of chocolate theme props, and the never ending aroma of cocoa beans floating about especially in the downstairs part of the restaurant.\n\nThey do have a couple of cocktails and mixed drinks made with chocolate and your favorite alcohol. It will however will run you about $12-13 per drink. We went with the shakes instead. The Hazelnut Cream Chocolate Milkshake ($8) - vanilla ice cream, dark chocolate truffle is worth mentioning and should not disappoint if you so order it.\n\nFor dessert (to share), we had The S'Mores Concoction ($11) - marshmallow fluff, milk  chocolate mousse, graham crackers, caramelized bananas. This looked like your 11th grade science project more then anything. Even the grid looking palate it came out on reminded me of being in class again. Every prop used for this dish will make you nostalgic of those days you use to pass puppy love notes in class to that cutie you had a crush on. Personally, it was fancy to look at more then eating it. It was good but I probably won't revisit it again.\n\nThe Melt Chocolate Truffle Heart Cake & Shake ($14) was the winner. Milk and white chocolate heart cake served with a creamy vanilla ice cream, red berries, and an iced milk chocolate shot. That shot of chocolate is crack like. The chocolate heart cake reminds me a of lava cake that is perfectly complimented by the vanilla ice cream. You pour the milk and white chocolate yourself so you have the option to go easy or douse. Again, this look was very appetizing but the taste of everything worked well together in perfect harmony. I want more of that stupid shake shot! \n\nHonestly, there's just too much to order from their dessert menu. Whether it be a variety of hot chocolates, to hand dipping your own ice cream bars (which they were out of on this day), to their infamous fondues, or cr\u00e8me brulee/waffle dishes. The possibilities are endless. I don't think one trip to Max Brenner is sufficient. That is why I say go for their desserts and that's it.\n\nRemember, I'll forewarn you that it's not a cheap place to grab dessert and the portions are quite petite. What they lack in size makes up in taste and presentation. You will feel like a kid in a candy or in this instance, chocolate store.\n\nAlso, check out their $5 cookie out in the front stand if you don't want to go in and sit down. Yes, its $5 but it's a damn good $5 cookie. If they close the stand, just walk to the bar inside the restaurant and ask the bartender for the $5 cookie, they'll know exactly what you're talking about. It may not seem like it was worth it after the initial bite but you'll soon be asking for more of it. Yeah, it's legit son."

The presentation of each dish, even the hot chocolate, was very creative and pleasing.  Service was good, and ambience is nice.  The only things holding me back from giving this 4 stars are that the waffle was very dry, the tiramisu was a tad too sweet, and the hot chocolate lacked depth of flavor.  Also, each dish is quite expensive for what it is.\n\nThat said, Max Brenner is worth checking out.  They have a lot to offer."

The food, service, and location were all excellent. It was so great, we went here twice during our stay. The second time I became adventurous and had a half order of their chocolate pizza w/ the works. Suffice it to say that I was in chocolate heaven. I could've downed a whole pizza by myself I think!! \n\nOh, my lunch was great too! Just be sure to save room for dessert!! So if you happen to find yourself wandering around the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace, go to Max Brenner's for a chocolate break. You won't be disappointed."

Not too bad, but nothing special, and not as good as the burger from the Society Cafe two days earlier. The pizza was terrible. My wife said it tasted like Elios, and I think that's an insult to Elios. Would never come back here for food.  3 stars for the burger, 0 stars for the pizza. \n\nThe we got dessert.

The shakes were on my mind as soon as we landed and that is exactly where we headed too. Going to Vegas during the summer was definitely not a great choice but we were in Vegas in a heat wave and all I've been thinking about was those damn Shakes! \n\nWe headed straight to Max Brenner from picking up our rental and we were probably a few of the first customers there around 10ish. We ordered some breakfast omelets and they were so good and fulfilling. It was unique how they had bread with our meals and chocolate and white chocolate served as replacement for their butter. I ordered the Hang over omelet which came with bacon, onions and red peppers and side of potatoes and buttermilk biscuits. \n\nI didn't know much of this place until I got here but there was tons of humgous chocolate bars displayed around the restaurant. Some were fake though but we got to hold one of the bars and it was quite heavy and quite expensive. If I was a kid I would love love love this place because I would want to get everything in chocolate. And this place is the place for that with Chocolate pizza, waffles, cookies, crepes, Bagels, and even A Chocolate Burger!  And of course I had to order me a shake, the chocolate hazelnut milkshake. which came in their famous Alice Cup. It was so refreshing and the it was made just right not too sweet and overpowering.\n\nThey also have a gift shop located to the right of the restaurant. I made sure I paid a visit there too so I could get my BFF a souvenir. I got here those Milkshake Mix with the infamous cups and she was so ecstatic about getting it. \n\nI can't wait to go back and try more of their amazing shakes! \n\nOnly reason it was short of a star was because of the prices, there was only 3 of us and my bill came out to $60.00 for breakfast and 2 shakes. Which is worth It but I wouldn't come here on a daily only because H&M is right across from them."

I didn't really taste any cocoa and just the smallest hint of chili. I saw it but I just wasn't tasting it... And I'm not even a fan of spicy stuff, but these fries were lacking.

Crowds were minimal and noise was minimal here.

When it was placed in front of me, my eyes lit up.  \"IS THIS ALL FOR ME??? YAYYY!!!\" The waffle was crispy and warm and the bananas were crispy after being caramelized.  The vanilla ice cream paired SOO well with the warm waffle and extra chocolate was set aside in a container that looked like a beaker.  Crispy coated chocolate pieces were also on the side too.  The dessert was absolutely delicious from beginning to end.  If there weren't other people around, I think I would have licked the plate in the end.\n\nService here was also great and efficient.  Our server gave us great recommendations and refilled our drinks regularly.  \n\nThey must have put something in the banana split waffles because I'm craving a dessert fix already!

It's like our server knew she was getting her 18% either way so she kind of ignored us.  She came quickly with our water.  After about 15 minutes waiting to order, one of the food runners said he would get our server.  I don't think he did.  We finally saw her and flagged her down to order.  That was the second time we saw her.  The third was when our food came after what seemed like forever and the last time was for our check.  There was one point when they were bringing our food out and we had asked one of the food runners for ketchup.  He brought us 3 little dishes of ketchup and then the other side of the table asked our server for ketchup.  She looked over at us and said, \"Are you guys going to use all that ketchup?\".  Seriously, you can't walk back to the kitchen to get more ketchup?  The restaurant wasn't that crowded so there was no excuse for this service.  Oh and then when we got our change back, she shorted us 64 cents.  When we asked her about it she said she doesn't carry change.  Even if you don't carry change, you don't short people.  It should be the other way around, give them extra.  Yeah, sure, it's only 64 cents but after the experience we had, it was just the icing on top of the cake.\n\nThe Food ---\nThe food was good.  I got the Max-ican omelette.  It came with Swiss cheese, salsa, black beans, avocado and a side of home fries, a biscuit and a dish of melted chocolate.  The chocolate was bomb, not going to deny that.  The omelette and home fries were also good but not outstanding.  The butter that came with the biscuit tasted like air so the biscuit was pretty dry.\n\nThe Prices --- \nI think most of the dishes were somewhere in the neighborhood of $14.\n\nDefinitely am not coming back.  The food did not make up for the service.  If the food had been any worse, I would have given 1 star."

Though I could always go for a serving of their thick hot chocolate, it was the mushroom and ricotta pizza, which drew me in to have a seat.  Being alone, I opted for a comfy bar seat, which was a great idea, because the bartender was there to take care of me immediately, and check on my regularly throughout my time there.  I loved the flat rate pricing on the drink menu, $6 for cocktails and wine, and $4 for beers, regardless of brand.  That mushroom and ricotta pizza, along with a glass of sparkling wine, were my choices for the evening.  The pizza was a perfect-for-one-person sized flat bread, with mozzarella, chunks of ricotta, black olives, and sun dried tomatoes, with a drizzling of balsamic vinegar.  The smooth ricotta, combined with the chunky bite of the mushrooms, and the crispness the crust, offered a great combination of textures.  The sun dried tomatoes provided the perfect amount of saltiness.  Though this was the only food item that I ordered, I eye witnessed other bar-seated patrons ordering other things, and making positive comments about what they were indulging in.  Because of my surrounding observations, I may just have to come back and try a few more things."

We ordered tomato pizza, some kind of pulled pork sliders, and philly cheesesteak sliders. The sliders were tasty, but the pulled pork slider was especially tasty. Our server said it was his favorite and he was definitely correct. The cheesesteak was just okay in comparison, but still good. The pizza was not good, at all. We had to send it back because it was soggy. The cheese tasted like rubber, the dough was wet, and we couldn't even pick it up with our hands, or even a fork and knife! Instead of the pizza, we ordered some other kind of slider with ham, turkey, and maple syrup. It was actually quite good. \n\nNow the desserts and other sweet things! The eighties milk shake was A-mazing. The icy chocolate drink part and the scoop of vanilla ice cream were perfect together. The chocolate shell on top was a tasty touch. We loved the glass it was served in so much that we went over to their store and bought not only chocolate, but also mugs, and glasses! Their Italian hot chocolate was decadent. It's a little thicker than normal hot chocolate, and definitely a hundred times better!  For dessert we had the sharing for two and the milk chocolate apple caramel crisp. The milk chocolate apple wasn't my favorite combination. It was just okay. I wouldn't order it again. The sampler was delicious. It came with a banana split waffle, chocolate cake, chocolate egg roll, chocolate crispy bar things, chocolate crispy balls, chocolate sauce, fruit and marshmallows, and a chocolate fondue. If I could, I would eat the waffle for breakfast! It was yummy! The chocolate cake was just okay. The egg roll was my least favorite. It was also the only thing left on the place when we left. The chocolate bars were probably my favorite thing there. Imagine a kit kat but waaayyy better. The crispy ball things tasted like chocolate covered cheerios, not my favorite thing on the plate. The chocolate fondue was yummy! We could roast the marshmallows then dip it in the chocolate, but I ended up just eating the chocolate with a spoon! It was delicious!\n\nOverall, I think you should just skip the main meal part, and just go straight to dessert. Why order real food at a chocolate place? The sampler was delicious, and I would definitely recommend it if you want to try several desserts, but I think it serves way more that two; maybe three people? The eighties milk shake is a must. You have to try it! And, you have to check out their shop! We bought a ton of stuff!"

I was craving hot chocolate, frozen hot chocolate, something decadent and was deciding between this and Serendipity. We decided to go with this and was planning on getting dessert of some sort.\n\nWell, although we had the intention of ordering their chocolate drinks and desserts we ended up getting their Adult chocolate infused drinks instead. (lil bro wanted some alcohol)\n\nAnyways.. so for drinks we got the following:\n\n-White Russian \nThis is their most popular drink. According to our waiter (who was super nice and very helpful) this is the most instagram worthy drink as well... so what the heck, I must get it right?\n\nWell the verdict is this... The flavors were bold, it tasted like a white russian infused with white chocolate. And to top it all off there were two marshmallows that came on a stirring stick. I must say that the concept was cute. The shot of white chocolate came in a miniature\nz flask and was very dainty, but for the price of the drink...and the size, I would say the drink was just alright and nothing too spectacular. It was good, but definitely not mind blowing..and not THAT instagram worthy. I must say though, that it was strong and perhaps the strongest alcoholic drink they serve.\n\n-Tiramisu\nThis drink was yummy and had a very good presentation. It came in a dainty cup with a ladyfinger cookie on top. If you love coffee or tiramisu for that matter, this would be a great drink. Not too heavy, not too strong, taste like an espresso drink.\n\nSo I really wanted to rate this place higher, but based on the drinks and the menu selection, I really wasn't impressed. Everything seemed overpriced (which should be expected since you're on the strip) but nothing seem to jump out of the page at me as something that i MUST try.\n\nThe actual location is cute, good location, great atmosphere, but definitely not worth the price that you pay. I mean, i'm sure there are better selections elsewhere.. more worth the calories and more satisfying to both your palette and wallet."

At the end of the meal, he did apologize for the bad service and said the restaurant was closing in April, so they were short staffed. Let's just say we were less than shocked. \n\nWhen we left the restaurant, my friend made a comment to the hostesses about the service we had received, and both of them looked at her and simply replied, \"okay.\" I have never complained to somebody at a restaurant about my service before, but I would expect them to at least express some sort of apology. \n\nAnyways, the food was alright- nothing to write home about. I will say the chocolate dishes looked fantastic, but it's safe to say that I won't be coming back to try those."

Car ride to Vegas much cheaper than a plane out to NY!\n\nMade reservations ahead of time because we had expected it to be as busy as the NY establishment.  To our surprise it was not at all packed.  There was plenty of seating available both upstairs and downstairs.\n\nThe staff seemed a little green.  They were not as friendly or confident as we are used to experiencing in most restaurants.  Our waitress had trouble doing more than one thing at a time as well.  They could easily fix this issue though.\n\nWe knew we wanted to get the Blackened Skirt Steak and Mushroom Quesadillas again!  Man this dish is seriously a piece of heaven.  The cheese, meat, mushrooms, and three different sauces all marry together into a mouthful of deliciousness!  Our new course for this visit was the Pasta la Mancha.  It was a decent dish, but nothing will ever satisfy our Max Brenner savory cravings like the quesadilla.\n\nThe place comes with desserts a plenty.  We've tried the several of them and like the Melting Chocolate Cake Souffle the most.  A number of different shakes to try as well.  You can even buy several items and of sweets from the gift store inside.  We snagged ourselves some Alice cups to take home.  \n\nOnly 4 stars cause the decor and ambiance just wasn't like it was in NY.  But don't get me wrong, we'll definitely make it a point to stop by at least once (if not more) every time we're in Vegas."

The texture of it wasn't so thick that I couldn't suck it through my straw. It was perfect! My boyfriend got Brenner Burger and it came with waffle fries and pickles. The burger was surprisingly good. I've been to a lot of burger joints and this one tops a lot of the ones  I've tried. The burger sat so tall I didn't even know how to bite into it so I used a knife and fork and just took a piece haha. I got the guilt free omelet.. but at first I was iffy about getting it because I wasn't really craving an omelet. But once it came, I took a bite and it was sooo good and has so much flavor. The potatoes that came with it were a little hard, but it was so tasty. It was seasoned just right. The biscuit was alittle dry.. but the taste of it was good especially when you dip it into the chocolate they give you. \n\nFor dessert, we got the sharing platter for two. It came with fondue, marshmallows (that you can roast yourself), strawberries, bananas, a waffle (too sweet) with ice cream, a tempura bananas, chocolate crispy ball stuff, 2 chocolate bars (that weren't textured like chocolate bars, but tasted like it). Overall, it was very delicious, but it was hard to finish because it was a lot of sweets. The only thing I probably didn't like was the waffle, because it was too sweet.\n\nOverall, our total came out to about $80 for these 4 items. The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because of our waiter. I felt like he was a little too inexperienced. But he still got the job done. I will definitely be back =]"

Orders came out wrong.  (A salad was ordered half-dressed with dressing on the side but it came out wrong.  Coffee came out cold.  Mojitos came out with very little mint.)\n3. We had two young kids (2 & 7) and usually restaurants will bring their drinks in kids cups (or covered cups), but the server didn't have the insight to do that for us.

More chefs should do this at restaurants - its nice to know a little about the minds behind the madness. \n\nAlthough everything is literally dripping in chocolate on the menu, we were in much more of a brunch mood and settled for the BLAT (Bacon Lettuce Avocado Tomato) sandwich, the spicy chicken burger and the Brenner Burger..DELICIOUSNESS all the way around! \n\nLet me warn you - the portions are somewhat huge and if you are in a sharing mode, I suggest ordering an appetizer each and an entree to share. \n\nWe couldn't make it to dessert - tummies were full. But we did have the Oreo milkshake in a really neat Alice mug. Sucker for all things Alice in Wonderland, it was a special treat to drink the shake out of a cup that demands you to Drink Me! \n\nLooking forward to revisiting again for dessert on a date night.

My friend and I got to the restaurant a little before 9PM and it wasn't very busy.  \n\nTheir menu is extensive so it can be hard to decide what to get.  We decided to share the Margerita Panini ($14.50) and the European Classic Fondue ($23).\n\nThe wait for our panini took awhile.  But I must say it was quite tasty for something so simple.  It was filled with mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and tomato aioli.  I think it could have done without the aioli since it made it so messy.  The cocoa and chili dusted waffle fries were so good!  They were perfectly fried and potatoey and the spicy and sweet worked well.  We were finally ready for our fondue.  It came with two choices of chocolate so we choose dark and white chocolate.  It also came with a third dipping sauce, a toffee one.  We both liked the toffee one.  Our dipping items were: strawberries, banana slices, marshmallows, banana bread and another cake.  We enjoyed the fondue and our waiter even asked us if we wanted any more of any dippers, but we were too stuffed.  It was a good fondue for sure.  I guess think everything should have been a little cheaper, but then again, it's on the strip, so it's expected.\n\nCan't wait to come back next time to try more desserts or brunch.  3.5 stars rounded up."

The trip to Max Brenner sucked since we were walking there from the Cosmo in uncomfortable shoes... I knew I should've worn some Adidas!  When we got there, the place was packed!  Not a surprise, since it was happy hour.  We had to sit at the very end of the bar, which wasn't very comfortable.  The server was really attentive though.  The moment the group of girls on our left side exited, she cleaned off the bar top for us and had us scoot down so we could be more comfy.  \n\nPros:\n * Super cheap happy hour.  $5.00 drinks and if its not on the menu, they can make it for you (as long as they have the alcohol.. .which they probably do).\n\n * Waffle Fries !!!!\n * Attentive service and very nice ambiance\n * Flat screens at the bar and is usually on Sports Channels for all you sport fans.\n * They have a little Chocolate shop next to the bar. \n\nCons:\n * located inside Caesar's, which can actually be a plus (shopping and food in one stop), but when you are coming strictly for Brenner's, you have to find a parking spot and walk through the casino, etc. to get there.  Good thing we just walked this time.\n * Food portions are pretty small, but surprisingly filling... It's gotta be the alcohol!\n\n* We didn't try it this time, but we did our first visit: Banana Tempura Fondue.  It sounds good right?  I was thinking something along the lines of a deep fried ice cream (like you can get at some Japanese Restaurants), but that was not the case.  The Banana itself was all mushy.  My gf and I are pretty daring with food and the textures of food doesn't bother us much, but this one was just a no-go!  It tasted like mush doused with sugar.  I liked the idea and am a fan of Bananas, Tempura, and Fondue.  This particular menu though is an epic fail.\n  The sliders are amazing.  You get 2 sliders per order and comes with some waffle fries, which are basically crisscut fries.  You can get a pretty good buzz going and satisfy your late night cravings for a pretty decent price at Max Brenner's.  It's hard to find a decent happy hour on the strip.  This is definitely one of my favorite Las Vegas Strip Happy Hours!\n\nTips:\n * Ask for a side of Chocolate Ranch for your fries and sliders!  Bomb!\n * Don't be shy to ask the Bartender about the different drinks they offer.  Also ask them for recommendations.  They are super friendly and helpful when it comes to that.\n * Say no to Drugs and Banana Tempura Fondue-due\n * Be adventurous when it comes to your alcohol here.. they have lots to offer.  i'd share some of my favorites with you, but honestly I can't remember the names LOL\n * come with a pen in hand.  Why you ask.. Because the napkins are graced with doodle of Max Brenner's head.  During out wait my girlfriend had a genius idea to draw on him.  The drawing we came up with were hilarious!!  She's so fun !!!!"

It's so rich that it covers the vodka in the drink. They top everything off with mashmellows. So good!\n\nDeeply Rich Dark Hot Chocolate = Four Stars, this is one hot small hot chocolate that you definitely need to share with someone. It is so velvety and rich. It's so chocolatey and creamy. It is certainly chocolate heaven for a chocoholic like myself. \n\nLiquor Infused Chocolates = They definitely offer some of the best chocolate around.

We got a bunch of different plates to share like the risotto, artichoke dip, wedge fries and mac and cheese. Overall the food was worth the price. This place is obviously known for its deserts/chocolate. The milkshakes were to DIE for. The only reason why I wouldn't go back is that the service was painfully slow and our server was extremely rude. We would try getting her attention multiple times as she walked right by us but she was too involved with her conversation w/ another worker that she walked by about 4x before noticing us. When she finally walked over she goes \"Yes?\" and stands there staring at us like we interrupted her. When we asked for boxes she boxes only 3 of our plates and brings out a box for me asking \"You're ok boxing this yourself right?\". It took over a hour for the food to come out and water/sodas were never refilled. The place wasn't busy either.. it was a Sunday about 2pm. \n\nJust awful service."

I am not a huge chocolate fan but Max Brenner made me experience what most chocolate aficionados must be experiencing when they eat chocolate!\n\nI read from a magazine that they opened a location late last year in Vegas (Caesar's The Forum Shops, right across the 3-story H&M store). And considering they only have three-- now four-- Max Brenner Restaurants in the US. (None in California, Why?!?!) I thought this was a MUST DO on our Vegas itinerary. And boy, was I right. :)\n\nOur server, Brenda, was very delightful. She introduced us to the whole 'Max Brenner Chocolate' experience. She was also very knowledgeable, if you can't make up your mind. Just ask her. Going to Max Brenner's is like going to a Candy Store. It's hard to pick which candy (or in this case, chocolate) to get.\n\nIn the end, we decided to do a 'taste test' and ordered the \"sharing for two\" dish (split up between 3 people, lol.) We also got an order of Sugar Crystal Churros and we didn't get to finish it. We were soooo full. Everything was so good! \n\nThey also had a huge selection of shakes and even their food presentation, their cups, mugs, etc. They were so whimsical. It really feels like a chocolate factory. Btw, you can purchase those mugs in the gift shop AND they also have free samples in there. So dig in! :)\n\nIf you are looking for the best chocolate martini... order Satisfaction Guaranteed! The name speaks for itself. Seriously. I never had appreciation for chocolate until now.\n\nWe will be back!"

Got there a little bit later because it is nearly impossible to turn into Caesar's Palace off the strip with the 5 gazillion tourists walking around. When we got to the restaurant, it looked like everyone had just cleared out. However, the host told us that they had Happy Hour specials at the bar, so we decided to forfeit the reservations and sit at the bar. The inner boozer made a good choice!\n\nWe each had some chocolate cocktails to start it off - wifey's chocolate martini was really great; my white russian was alright. I felt they could both use some more alcohol, but if you're looking for a tasty drink, you've found some right here. The server/bartender was pretty helpful but slightly all over the place so we didn't get our waters or place settings right away. Who cares though, we have chocolatey alcohol in our hands. I let things slide here that wouldn't be taken lightly at other places.\n\nLooked for Giancarla E's recommended Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate pancakes but didn't see them on their menu. Plus the wifey wanted to get the fondue so I decided to save the chocolate for later. Got some $6 sliders and white corn croquettes, which were both pretty decent (the chipotle sauce that came with the croquettes was pretty flavorful). Got the waffle (crisscut) fries but I didn't really get a whole lot of the chocolate/chili taste that other posters raved about. Seriously just tasted like some Carl's Jr or Chick fil-A crisscut fries. \n\nAnyway, we weren't here to induce ourselves into food comas (we were saving that for the next day at Bacchanal), but the fondue for two really put us over the top. Really liked that you could toast your own marshmallows - wifey had fun almost burning down the restaurant. \n\nLocation was pretty nice, and if you have a private party upstairs, it looked like a chill spot. It's located in the Forum Shops so you can go there for a late dinner and still have time to walk around and do some shopping (most stores close around midnight)."

Two stories in size and featuring many things chocolate plus a collection of overpriced comfort foods it was just after 10:00am when we sat down at a cozy two top near the base of the stairs and treated to pleasant \"everything is good\" service typical to such places a five part order was hatched as the restaurant bustled, leaving one to ponder the reasons for any pending change.  With service swift it was only a matter of minutes before selections began to arrive, the first a superlative $8 milkshake thick with caramel and rife with vanilla but topped with copious whipped cream to mask what I'd guess to be an 8oz serving, a trend carried over to each plate that followed as large prices met small portions thankfully bolstered by bold flavors.  Starting sweet and following with savory due to a kitchen miscalculation it should be noted that each of Brenner's pure chocolates are well sourced, smooth, and complex by the bar and as such both white and milk versions only served to improve the Custard French toast and Soft Cookie, the later on par with that of New York's fabled Levain Bakery in terms of taste and texture (though at 2.5x the price) and while I think everyone would have been happier to see the Croquettes first I'd be lying if I didn't say they were my favorite bite of the meal - the paprika and manchego working smoky, savory magic on the lightly fried kernels."

So given that, the fact that I was still blown away by the offerings here - says everything.\n\nOn our final night in Vegas, my guy and I ventured in for a late-night dinner and drinks. Located conveniently inside Caesar's Palace (we stayed at Nobu Hotel), this was stumbling distance back to our suite - perfect.\n\nWe started with a pair of the signature chocolate martinis. Picture the most perfect milk chocolate ganache, a hefty swig of premium vodka, and a dusting of chocolate powder...all perfectly poured into a sizable martini glass and topped with a ripe, chocolate-dipped strawberry skewer. Pure bliss, I tell you. The smoothness of all ingredients mingled together perfectly. We hardly needed dinner after these babies!\n\nDinner, however, also did not disappoint. A bacon burger for him, a grilled chicken panini for me - and we were set! The accompanying waffle-cut fries were a great touch. We were officially stuffed and ready to roll out (literally).\n\nBut then I saw it: A marshmallow-topped, white chocolate ganache white russian. Yes, I had to have it. It came out with a side of liquid white chocolate ganache which we drizzled into the perfect cocktail to our heart's content. (This drink was also amazing.) \n\nKey takeaways: Go here for a chocolate martini, even if you aren't a dessert person or a chocolate lover! Stay for some food (you'll need it), then split another beverage or two. If you're a fan of White Russians, do not pass up the opportunity to get one here. \n\nRegardless of what you choose, you will want to try everything on the menu! On our next visit, I'm hittin' this place up for a chocolate-covered brunch. O.M.G."

I ordered the Southwest Caesar salad, the Most Orgasmic Tuna Sandwich Ever (not really named that, but should have been), and a Chocolate Pizza for dessert. For only a pretty Jackson, that was so much food. Jesus! My Caesar salad was basic - romaine, avocado, tomato, a Parmesan crisp and a chipotle dressing. It was quite a portion, enough to fill me up for the rest of the meal. Nothing too spectacular other than the fact that every bite was avocado-laden, rendering the dressing unnecessary.\n\nThe Tuna sandwich was seriously some good eats. Real tuna, lettuce, onion, and barbeque chips?!?! I must agree with my brother - whoever made that was probably high. But I loved every bite of it.\n\nLastly, I ordered the Chocolate Pizza with hazelnut bits and banana. It was good, but after watching the show \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Pizza\", it definitely didn't live up to the hype I expected.  \n\nThank goodness for Restaurant Week.

Tasted so crispy & fresh with the avocados. My Minty lemonade was refreshing! It was like a virgin mojito, which made me love it more. I had the sharing fondue for dessert which came with so much sweets to share for 4. Overall, food was awesome. Service just didn't live up to it because of the consistent trouble. Monotone server, empty waters, room temperature water, & had to wave for assistance a few times. I'll be back to satisfy my chocolate cravings though."

Raged through it like a homeless without food for a month. You will love this place if you love sweets and desserts and a cool chill place to hang with your friends and yes family!!! it's pretty kid friendly, i would say out of 5 for most kid friendly it would be a 3.7 just cuz i feel like it.. ;) it' s not quite a 4 and above since it is dark and still has a bar vibe but the seating by the wall is great cuz kids can lean against it. Caution: only bring them here if they are good because they'd be more hyper than you'd like after leaving!\n\nDrinks we had some lemon thing and some green thing. I totally forgot. Was blown away by the dessert itself! Def a must go after your shopping!"

It was made with dulce de leche icecream, toffee sauce, pure milk chocolate & whipped cream with the added Cake Vodka. mmmmmmm\nMy friend had a Hazelnut Cream Chocolate Milkshake and added a hazelnut kind of liquor and she was loving it. Also they came in the cutest Alice in Wonderland kind of glass that said  \"Drink Me\" and when you looked down at the opening of the glass it was the Cheshire Cat's smile. They sold them there too...I should of bought one.\n\nMy friend order a Grilled Chicken Panini and fries, she said it was good and I got the appetizer White Corn Croquettes which I liked, they were small, like one or two bites worth and 4 came on a plate.\n\nThe bill came in this cute/fun box that said  \"Money for Life\" and \"Chocolate for the Soul\" on it.\n\nOur waiter was super friendly and helpful with helping us decide on what to get and what not to get.\n\nThey have a small little store where you can buy some yummy chocolate items and gifts to take home, we even got a sample of a chocolate candy."

Yummy! I love waffles and the tutti frutti was a perfect balance between sweet and fruity. The choco-pop was a nice addition. I would highly recommend this if you're a waffle lover. \n*the best B.A.L.T. which really is the avocado BLT- which was a little confusing because we thought it was going to be a burger with avocado BLT. However nevertheless it was very delicious it came with a side of waffle fries that is dusted with chili and cocoa powder. The waffle fries side is quite small so if you're sharing I would recommend ordering another side of waffle fries because they're just that good. $14.75. you think for almost 15 bucks i'll get a piece of meat. But everything was fresh and the bacon was thick.  \n\n\ntips: \n*You can make reservations on OpenTable. \n*indoor and outdoor seating. Inside might be a little bit loud. \n*located inside the forum. \n*They have a little chocolate type of store and they give free samples. \n*They have cool looking coffee machines. \n*Cash and credit card accepted. \n*Happy Hour is from 3-6pm.\n\noverall, Staff are really nice and attentive. The really encourage you to read the story behind Max Brenner.  Now when my girlfriend and I asked the waitress what would she recommend to eat... it was really hard because she recommended everything she informed us that she gained a lot of weight working there because everything tastes so good. So that totally didn't help us decide. we had a very difficult time because we wanted two get two items and half it so we'll be able to try both items. I definitely loved the food, atmosphere, and service here at Max Brenner and will definitely comeback especially for the waffles. There's more items on the menu that I wanna try.  Two thumbs up!"

Not only is the ambiance fun, but the food choices are excellent and the whole place explodes of chocolate.  From chocolate cocktails to cocoa dusted waffle fries, Max Brenner covers everything with a bit of sweet satisfaction.  For the Forums this place is reasonably priced and all dishes can easily be shared by two people if you have a small appetite.\n\nI truly enjoyed the eating their appetizer of fried pita with bobba..something..and their spice rubbed wings were awesome.  I had the classic burger with waffle fries--huge, juicy, and yummy--and my husband had the fish sandwhich, which consisisted of fried salmon and not fried white fish.  It was a great twist and was interesting to eat (although I don't like salmon at all).  We had a hazelnut cream shake that came in a cool glass (I bought one on my way out), and their vanilla popsicle fondue for dessert was fun and just the right size.\n\nIf you're looking for a chocolate experience that's fresh in town, try out Max Brenner.  It's a great place for chocolate, food, and overall fun.\n\nPS: Ask for Danielle.  She's a star!"

The food's not bad, although maybe a little overpriced especially since the portions are a little small. The highlight here is really their desserts and drinks though. If you're coming here just to eat food, you're really doing yourself a disservice. On a couple of other notes, the chocolate pizza is amazing and something I could see myself snacking on in the middle of the night if I had the resources for it.. Also, although I personally can't stand bananas, my friend really really liked her banana tempura fondue dessert as well. \n\nHappy Hour is from 3-6pm, and you can get smaller portions of some of their desserts (including the chocolate pizza and banana tempura) which is perfect if you're only going by yourself or with a friend!"

Did I mention it was chocolate vodka? Enough said!!\n\n2) WAFFLE FRIES dusted with cocoa and chili powder and chili mayo for dipping (4stars) - this was delicious, but absolutely not worth $6 b/c the amount was ridic. You get like 10 waffle fries. I suppose it's worth trying once, but I wouldn't get it again.\n\n3) OMG CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIE ($5)  with the option of dark chocolate or milk chocolate with walnuts - (NO stars). Also, if you want it on the plate with fancy side garnishes it will cost $12, but if you just want the cookie it's $5. I chose the milk chocolate option and was disappointed that the cookie was pretty tasteless and not to mention BURNT all around the edges. I literally took one bite and left the rest alone b/c it wasn't worth the calories. \n\n4) ONION RINGS (2 stars) - 6 or 7 onion rings for $6. No - not only were these not great, they were pricey. \n\nOverall I give this place 3 stars b/c their prices were steep and tiny portions. I would however return for the intoxicake drink.

They are actually tossed in cocoa powder and served in a great sauce! \n\nI most enjoyed the tea. Yes, the hot tea. They serve it in a fancy glass device they steeps it and then it strains it directly into the cup. It was incredibly unexpected and neat.

The restaurant wasn't busy and we were seated immediately. \n\nOur waiter greeted us and have us the 411 on Max Brenner. I ordered the steak panini ($16.50) and Hubs ordered the cheese steak waffle sandwich ($14.95). The food took about 20 minutes. The steak panini was delicious and a little messy since the ingredients were chopped so it kept falling out. Hubs sandwich was a disaster. The taste was good but the waffle was thin and got soggy. He gave up on using his hands and went with flat ware. The waffle fries are to die for crispy and seasoned perfectly. For dessert we shared \"The works\" half portion pizza ($9.95) OMG, talk about a sugar high. It was all of my favs in one, carbs, banana, peanuts, chocolate and marshmallows. A small slice is all I needed since it was so rich. \n\nOur second visit was for brunch the next day. I made reservations the night before but it wasn't needed. When we showed up it was pretty dead. I ordered the \"Max-ican\" omelette (with egg whites $14.95) and Hubs ordered the tomato, bacon and cream cheese bagel ($6.95) and a pumpkin pie hot chocolate ($5.95) Brunch was delivered quickly. The omelette and potatoes were okay. The omelette didn't have much flavor and the potatoes were hard, cold and over fried. The biscuit was sweet, soft and warm so good with or without the chocolate dipping sauce.\n\nService was great during both visits by the waiters, Beau and Ruy. I over heard the staff talking about how they were all sick during our brunch visit and saw one of them blowing and wiping their nose behind the bar area where the crepes area made. That was pretty disgusting and unprofessional. If that happened during our first visit we wouldn't have returned. \n\nPrices for the food quality and portions are average. It is a cool place and has good menu options. I'm turned off by some of the staff's actions, the complaining about being sick and the hostess not knowing how to take/make reservations (long story short it took 10 minutes to get it done) \n\nOverall the dinner experience was 4 stars and brunch was 2 stars."

Now, I should honestly tell you that I am not a huge chocolate fan (shocking I know!), but I was intrigued by the way that chocolate was being incorporated into the ingredients.\n\nThe food, the service, and the smell of chocolate in the air made for a great dinner, and sitting outside on the patio (although it's not really outside but just a view of people passing by the Forum Shops) was pretty relaxing.\n\nDRINKS:\n\nSatisfaction Guaranteed!  Nope, that's not what I think about the drinks here, that is in fact that actual name of a drink.  It's pretty much like a spiked chocolate milk (castries peanut liqueur, caramel liqueur, milk chocolate served up)....but a very very very notched up version which was amazing.  They serve it to you in a martini glass (sans stem) which is placed in a small bowl of ice to keep it cold while you drink it.  It also comes with a small beaker with some extra in it as well as some spicy peanuts which really do add to the flavor of the drink as you enjoy it.  \n\nFOOD:\n\nThe food was great. To start, we got the onion rings which come with a chocolate ranch dressing. Now some of you might be thinking \"blech!!!\" but I have to say...don't knock it to you try it. It's pretty mild, so don't expect a huge burst of flavor...just enjoy it for it is.\n\nFor my main course I had the grilled asparagus crepe and it was huge! (That's what she said! lol).   It was very flavorful and filled with perfectly al dente  aspargus and a lot of cheese.  An excellent way to be induced into a food coma.\n\nUnfortunately I simply had no room for dessert, but did buy some pieces of individual chocolate from the store inside.  One to try (if they still have it)...chocolate filled with halva.  Halva is a Middle Eastern thing (difficult to explain really), so I really impressed that they would have such a chocolate there.   The chocolates overall were VERY good (although I still think Tseucher is the best) and were a great way to end the meal.\n\nI would highly recommend you come here at least once to see what it's all about.  The menu is fairly large and there are many options for picky eaters."

This time, I came back for dinner. \n\nI ordered the Black Sesame Salmon with the Wasabi Aioli. At first, I was undecided whether I wanted the fish tacos or the Black Sesame Salmon, but the waitress quickly convinced me to get the salmon because it was her favorite dish. When it came, the presentation was beautiful. The salmon came with saut\u00e9ed veggies that tasted amazing, and the wasabi aioli was in a little ceramic cup on the plate. On the other side of the plate was a little beaker of soy sauce, which I think the plate didn't need, but it looked great anyway. THe fish itself was COVERED in black sesame (as in crusted), and you couldn't even see any inch of the fish from the top. The taste itself was SPOT on. The combination of the sesame and the awesome aioli really had an authentic and delicious taste to it. The wasabi aioli didn't really taste like wasabi or aioli, but a bit like honey mustard. That combined with the black sesame seeds really hit the spot. The only gripe I would have is that the salmon itself was a bit overdone and was hard and a bit more chewy. I really hope that they work on this because this dish was SO close to being perfect! \n\n Service was great; super attentive and friendly. Would go back for the salmon *IF THEY WORK ON NOT OVERCOOKING IT!!!* :)"

The mini cake is packed with flavor but the sweetness is very subtle. If you have a sweet tooth, you can pour on or dip your cake into the chocolate cream they give you and it'll be like a chocolate cake fondue. The cake was so moist and baked in perfectness too! My family also tried a shake and two hot chocolates (one dark and one milk chocolate). Those items were tasty but the price makes hesitates me to get it again. Otherwise, good experience with service and cleanliness and the chill atmosphere!"

The happy hour list has been cut down to fewer offerings than on my last review but still has 6 cocktails plus select beer ($4) and wine on special.  3 of the cocktails are chocolatey so there are even more options as you can choose white, milk, or dark chocolate options.  The snacks are great and enough to share if you aren't starving or have a crazy sweet tooth.  We got the 80s shake from the regular menu and 3 cocktails, the smoky corn croquettes which were good but the smoked paprika ruined my chocolate palette, the cheese pizza which was bigger than expected, and the trout banana fondue.  So 6 happy hour things and 1 of the ref menu for $43.  I only come here for happy hour because I'm cheap.  Staff was really attentive and even let us have happy hour at a table instead of the barrio since it was busy.  We usually have our teen sit at a 2 top close by and we sit at the bar and carry good back and forth.  He's happy becauSe he's eating amazingly chocolatey goodness without his mom and I'm happy because he's stuffing his face for cheap.  Growing boys and all that.  My bf and I still get time to ourselves, also with awesome sweets, and for a pretty penny.  The best part is that once you Re hopped up on sugar, you can go to the 3 story h&m across the way and get even more deals with the money you saved!  We aren't gamblers, so, for me, this IS the best part of Vegas.  I do Lobster ME and the Betty Paige store a different day.  Same results."

I was not disappointed. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the full pizza w/ works and a chocolate peanut butter milkshake. He also ordered chicken strips, which he was a fan of. \n\nWhen we ordered, my waitress recommended we get the pizza without the works, since she said the banana and peanut butter feel unnecessary when you eat it. I love banana and peanut butter so I didn't take her advice. After having had the pizza, I think she was right. I would have much rather just had the chocolate and the marshmallows - they were more than enough. Nevertheless, the pizza was orgasmic, and I cannot wait until I have it again. Next time, I also want to try a chocolate chip cookie.\n\nThe shake was cool and refreshing - I wouldn't say it was the best shake I've ever had, but it was solid.\n\nOur waitress was amazing - I think her name was Roxanne!"

It was unique and just very pretty and impressive, I almost didn't want to eat it.  The pictures really don't do it any justice.  The plate comes with little dishes filled with sauces, like chocolate or other sweet sauces/butterscoth? on the side.  I like this because you can add sweetness to taste.  The bananas that came with my crepe were also served individually.  I saw other people's dishes, like their burgers, the presentations are appetizing, I wanted to taste everything on the menu. \n    Had the hot chocolate with a shot of Bailey's: ....mmmm...it was a tad sweet, I believe b/c of the Bailey's, but was good.  \n   The next day I was craving it and came back for some more.  This time, I ordered the choclate crepe with hazelnut, toffee and banana...woah was it awesome! The icecream had a nice little bunch of crispy nuts covered in this spicy curry-ish? sort of spice on it, it  totally caught me off guard, it was like wait,what was that? huh? awesome!  The crepe had all kinds of textures to it, soft, crispy, fluffy at the same time.  High quality chocolate.\n     I also tried their chocolate oatmeal, delicious, the best oatmeal I've ever tasted.  \n      Their coffee was really good, kind of tasted a little bit like Mexican Cafe de Olla.  \n      The portions are large, their dishes are meant to be shared. I think you could share a crepe among 3 people with normal appetites.  The oatmeal you can probably share among 2.  The dishes are simply too rich to have large portions, you'll definately feel fatter after eating this, but well worth it.  \n      I think that their awesome customer service is worth mentioning, both times I went there all of the workers were super helpful and nice, I really appreciated the unpretentiousness.  The only problem was that the girls in the merchandise area weren't very knowledgable about prices for merchendise, and prices weren't on all of the merchendise    I bought some mugs to bring home as souveniers, even though I don't think that the cute \"hug mugs\" serve their purpose so well - if you try to \"hug\" it, it will burn the F*@** outta your hands, so let your chocolate cool before you hug it.   \n              The place is very clean, nostalgic, and romantic.  Reminds me a little bit of disneyland.  Would definately come back. Great place for a date first date.\n      Just to compare, I also visited the famous Jean Phillipe pastry place at the Bellagio, hands down M. Brenner is better.  J.P left me a little dissapointed with their very eggy-tasting desserts.  They weren't awful, but definately not the quality I expected from J.P.  M. Brenner has better desserts."

The entire restaurant was so much fun that I don't even remember having that much fun as a child!  For anyone who has watched Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and remembers the boy who cracked open the pumpkin and spooned liquid chocolate into his mouth with his bare hand, you will feel like that boy at Max Brenner.  It was like my wildest chocolate fantasy come true.  The molten chocolate cake with a milk chocolate shot and the banana tempura fondue with chocolate and toffee sauces were both everything I hoped they'd be.

Happy Hour specials are available at the bar only and include $4 beer, $6 cocktails and $6 appetizers and desserts. What a great deal for Vegas! I ordered the Lucky Lemon (Ketel One, Citoreon Vodka, Grand Mariner and Lemon Juice) and my boyfriend ordered the margarita. Both were delicious and very potent. The bartender mixed them up in front of us and really took her time crafting our cocktails. We also ordered the Cheesy Thin Crust Pizza (served with grape tomatoes) - pretty good and the Sliders: 2 Brenner Burgers (Lettuce, Tomato, Onion Ring and BBQ sauce) and 2Buffalo Chicken (crispy buffalo chicken with bleu cheese aioli) - both were very good and came with fries! Great flavors! I would love to come back here for dessert. Someone next to us ordered the Chocolate Chunks Pizza and it looked so good! Can't wait to try this place again!"

There are two sides to the store. The first is where you dine and on the opposite side are all their confections. \n\nI did the unthinkable and ordered the Deep Blue Cobb Salad. I wasn't feeling very well so I wanted something as light as possible. It was decadent with the bleu cheese and bacon, but the salad wasn't big at all, so the flavors weren't overwhelming. It was a good salad but I'll try to never order a salad from here again. \n\nMy fiance went the sweet breakfast route and ordered the After Party Belgian Waffle. The waffle was cooked well but it consisted of two small waffles covered in whipped cream and strawberries. In two little mini beakers were the melted white chocolate and strawberry honey. It tastes like a creamy strawberry syrup and the white chocolate was good. \n\nThe next time we visit, I said we'd have to try the Chocolate Fondue. A few people ordered it to share and it looked amazing. I'd suggest going out of your comfort zone in a place like this. \n\nWe also ordered milkshakes and when you see the prices on these things, you might remember the $5 milkshake scene in Pulp Fiction. Well, these were $8 milkshakes so they better be good. I got the 80s milkshake and it was really boring. He got the Chocolate Espresso milkshake and the flavors were much better, although I didn't taste much of the espresso in there. They weren't worth the price, in my opinion, as our tastebuds didn't receive a blast of excitement as we expected, but they were tasty. We might split one if we decide to try them again. Even Sugar Factory's ice cream concoctions were more creative and comparable in price. Toward the end, my fiance also ordered an Americano with an extra shot and I remember him enjoying it. Before tip, our total cost $53.89 and it was pricey. The $15 salad wasn't worth it and I feel like you have to go big or go home otherwise you might be disappointed. \n\nOn the other side, the chocolate shop is small and sometimes cramped. There is a chocolate twist in all of their treats. Chocolate is their thing. The waitress even gave us a 10% off coupon to use so we found it difficult to pass up buying several things we wanted including their variety box. The only thing that stopped us was our drive back to LA. Being that we were in July and the average day in Vegas was 110 degrees, we decided against it. Another time, we told ourselves."

At least stuff that I could stomach. \n\nThe omelet was made up of mushroom, spinach, onion, peppers, tomato & swiss cheese and it was delicious. Even though I was full, I kept eating.\n\nThe sides included a diamond dusted sugar buttermilk biscuit, spiced fries and melted chocolate lick.\n\nThe biscuit was great especially with the chocolate but there was no way I could eat all of it because my body told me to stop or else it'd give me diabetes.\n\nI also shared an Eighties Milkshake which perfect except for that whole body threatening me with diabetes thing."

My husband had the fish tacos and almost made himself sick because he was so full but wanted to finish it. \n\nWe ordered a banana dessert that was amazing and then to top is all off they had made an extra hot white chocolate that wasn't ordered so our server offered it to us...and it was yummy!!!\n\nIt was a little pricey for us to go to on the regular but for sure I want to go back and take the kids because I think they would enjoy it too."

            "review": "When I contemplate some of the top highlights of my recent trip to Las Vegas, the evening I had at Max Brenner's is one that is still seated in the forefront of my thoughts. I think I found my new favorite restaurant on the strip, and I'm head over heels in love with it. \n\nMax Brenner has developed quite the notoriety for its ability to cater to the sensibilities of us chocoholics. Indeed, it's expansive dessert menu is what initially caused my antennas to go up, and, inevitably, for it to be bookmarked in my Yelp to-do list. Nevertheless, I had been reading reviews that also boasted about the other items on Max's menu. Sure enough, not only is Max Brenner an amazing dessert destination (and that's the understatement of the century), but it's also a great spot to enjoy a phenomenal meal before embarking on the mission to satiate a raging chocolate craving.\n\nWe arrived for 8pm reservations on a Saturday night. Reservations aren't necessary, but it's probably smart because it's hard to predict when the retaurant may face an onslaught of hungry tourists that are trapsing around The Forum at all hours of the day/night. The hostesses were sweet and welcoming and took us to our table where the menu was explained. I decided to start with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, and my dining companion had Max's White Russian ($13). Although I enjoyed the refreshing, crisp taste of my white wine, I had a sip of the white Russian and it was sheer perfection in a glass. Loved it.\n\nFor an appetizer, we decided to share the White Corn Croquettes ($11.95). Absolutely delicious. I was so impressed by how each croquette was balanced in taste. The manchego cheese was nicely offset by the sweet corn, and all of those elements were married perfectly together by the exterior, crispy batter. Brilliant.\n\nFor my main entree, I opted for the Grilled Chicken Panini ($14.50), and my date had the much-bragged-about Brenner Burger ($14.25). My panini was served in a creative fashion, artfully stacked. The sandwich caused me to swoon, and the olive pesto sauce that was lightly spread on the bread was divine. My companion's Brenner Burger looked equally good. It was very large, and was also flavored by a giant vidalia fried onion ring. I would have had a bite, but I was enjoying my panini too much. Typically, I'm not much of a fry eater, but the waffle fries that came with our sandwiches were so ridiculously good. It's the first time in a long time that I've actually finished the fries that came wtih my entree.\n\nBecause the profane indulgence at dinner wasn't enough, we moved on to dessert. I was given the authority to choose what I wanted on the menu; therefore, I picked the O.M.G. Chocolate Chunk Cookie ($9.95). Yes, paying almost $10 for a cookie sounds outlandish, but the cookies at Max Brenner are far from conventional. Our milk chocolate cookie, a giant cookie that practically occupied the majority of the real estate on the plate it was sitting on, was served with a hot fudge ganache, whipped cream and chopped strawberries. Heaven. In addition, I also had a cup of Max's famous hot chocolate, and it, too, was staggeringly rich and good. \n\nOur waiter was fantastic. Service was swift. Our orders didn't lag. I was impressed by the entire operation.\n\nNeedless to say, I woke up with a tummy ache, but it's my fault. I went overboard. I ate too much. And it's so easy to do at a place like Max Brenner. There will be another time when I find myself in Las Vegas, and it will give me another opportunity to explore the menu even further. \n\nBottom line:  If you go to Vegas, Max Brenner is a must."

I ordered a white spicy mexican hot chocolate along with my \"well-mannered\" omelette. I substituted my homefries/potatoes for their famous waffles fries. It was a decent meal but there was nothing special to it. They said that their waffle fries are seasoned with spices and chocolate but you could have fooled me if you swapped it with Carl's junior crisscut fries (they tasted the same). The omelette was good, lots of goat cheese and spinach, but again nothing special to it. I must say that my favorite thing about my plate was the biscuit! They give you a side of butter and chocolate for spread and it was delicious! As for my hot chocolate, it was very creamy and just had the right spice to it for a mexican hot chocolate, you can taste spice from the nutmeg mixed with cinnamon. It came in a cute little \"hug\" mug but for $6 do I think it's worth NO, I would have preferred for it to come in a regular cup and paid less. My whole meal cost $25, I could have spent a few extra bucks and have gone to a buffet! I'm not saying don't go here because my experience here was actually quite pleasant. In fact, the server was so nice she didn't charge the automatic gratuity for our large group but of course we tipped her well! Just know that you're not paying for quality food, you're paying for the name \"Max Brenner\"!"

I was shocked to see Max Brenner with a Groupon because quite frankly, this is a popular restaurant known world wide that can get by without a Groupon, I'm sure. \n\nOf course the chocolate here is ridiculous- and by ridiculous, I mean freaking amazing. There isn't a piece of chocolate on Max's menu that couldn't bring me to tears of joy. This chocolate is dark, rich, thick, a whole bunch of decadent adjectives baby. A list of deserts so delicious, it'll have you wishing you were Augustus Gloop.\n\nI'd have to say, The Bald Man has done us west coasters a solid by bringing his chocolate to Caesars. The theme of this restaurant is interesting- very 'wooden chocolate industrial workshop' vibe going on. The plates and cups are all unique. The pizza was delicious, the shakes were delicious, deserts were delicious- I was very satisfied."

            "review": "If you love chocolate, you'll love Max Brenner!  This place is like chocolate nirvana.  Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate everywhere!  Place is nice with modern decor, and the smell of cocoa wafting everywhere inside.  I think the last restaurant to occupy this space in Caesar's was Chinois.  \n\nThis review is only for the desserts part of the menu, we didn't try any of the breakfast, brunch, or dinner food so I won't be commenting on it.  But a lot of it did look good!  On to some chocolate!\n\nMyself, I'm not much of a chocolate or sweets fan (I'll make an exception for ice cream, my Mom's baking, and Halo-Halo) so I tend to not eat it very often.  My niece asked us to meet her there for a 'snack' one evening she was visiting LV and we said, \"Where?\"  That's my first hearing of Max Brenner.  I pull up the website online and check out their menu.  They had a lot of spins on chocolate and desserts involving chocolate.  Almost everything they had on the dessert menu had chocolate.  See a theme here?  It seemed intriguing, and of course my lady had no objections trying this place out.\n\nAt Max Brenner's they take their chocolate seriously.  It's supposed to be an experience, a celebration of cultures of sorts.  In fact, I think the company itself calls it the 'New worldwide chocolate culture'.  But don't quote me!  Their dessert menu is varied and is very playful.  There are 'crepe brulees' and waffles, sweet icons like S'mores , classics with a chocolate twist like tiramisu and cheesecake, their popular chocolate fondue, as well as their menu named 'Max I Scream' with their takes on ice cream and chocolate.  \n\nFirst we tried the Chocolate Chunks Pizza with the works - Max's double chocolate melting chunks with hazelnuts, bananas, peanut butter, and roasted marshmallows ($16.95).  I thought for this price the pizza should be fairly large but when it came out, it was only about a 9 or 10 inch!  A bit small, but six of us managed to share the whole thing because we could only handle a slice each!  It's very rich and decadent, lots of chocolate and lots of sweet.  Sweet for my tastes but it was good nonetheless.  My main gripe was that the pizza crust was a bit too thick and not very crunchy.  Everyone else on the table loved it though.  \n\nNext we tried the Banana Split Waffles with vanilla bourbon ice cream, milk chocolate truffle, and caramelized rice krispies ($13.95).  I thought this was pretty good.  The waffle was nice and warm and went great with the cool ice cream.  This desert I liked better because it wasn't over the top sweet, I found it had a better balance of flavors and the chocolate was more complemented by the waffle.  This dessert was a bit on the small size as well but we managed to share just fine.\n\nMy niece said we had to try the fries, I said \"Sure, why not?\"  For me this was the best thing of the night.  Max Brenner's Waffle Fries 'dusted' with chili and cocoa powder were excellent!  Coming to our table nice and hot, the crunchy, savory waffle fries went very well with the semi-sweet cocoa powder dusted on.  I couldn't stop eating them!  They even tasted good after dipping them in ketchup!  Sorry folks if I ruined the flavor for you on that one, ketchup is a food group at my house...it goes with EVERYTHING!  My only complaint was that the serving size again - on the small side.  Who eats here, Oompa Loompas?\n\nRegardless of the smaller portions here I think another visit to Max Brenner's is in order.  I really want to try their ice cream concoctions and their fondue.  Service was quick and friendly here, and not too bothersome so we could catch up with my niece.  Max Brenner also has a chocolate shop within the restaurant where you can stock up on nearly anything chocolate for your trip back home.  Nuts, candies, you name it.  Oh yeah, where else can you get a $5 shot of Max Brenner premium chocolate in a plastic syringe??  Creepy to me, but some folks were in line waiting outside the restaurant for a free sample of this crack-like chocolate from a syringe!  It was like their fix of the day!  They got my kids to give in too...we ended up buying one to take home!  Diabetics beware!!\n\n\n**Oh, I forgot to mention, the chocolate from the syringe is squirted into your mouth...not injected into your arm!**"

Tastes great, but $13 for a small tuna sandwich? Come on guys. The fondue is also good, the marshmallow roaster is a cute touch, which distracts you from the fact that you are not eating anything particularly amazing. The chocolate pizza tasted like slightly soft cardboard smothered in Skippy. The hazelnut milkshake is awesome, though. I think I was so blinded by the excitement of eating at Willy Wonka's restaurant that I forgot to properly evaluate the place.\n\nOverall, I wish it was higher quality for the price.

There is a counter outside where you can order their Italian hot chocolate and some other items, or you can go inside to the bar where they have more options for you to choose from.  After getting a sample of the milk chocolate Italian hot chocolate and not being too impressed with it, we decided to go inside to get our drinks.  (FYI their Italian hot chocolate is supposed to be thick but it wasn't at all; it had the consistency of regular hot chocolate.)  We love having marshmallow in our hot chocolate so we ordered a milk chocolate hot chocolate with melting marshmallows and a white chocolate hot chocolate also with melting marshmallows.  I was pretty disappointed with the first half or so of the drink.  It was really runny and flavorless.  It wasn't until I got to the bottom that I started to enjoy my drink more.  All the marshmallows were at the bottom so it added more flavor to it.  If not I would've had to give this place a lower rating!  \n\nI had read about the chocolate chip walnut cookie so we had to give it a try.  It's a pricey cookie (about $5) but it's huge and worth it!  It is thick and ooey and gooey and warm with delicious chocolate flavor!  We bought it at the counter and the guy working the counter and outside dining area was awesome, so helpful and friendly.  He was MIA from the counter for awhile but then again he had double duty, taking care of both the dining customers and the walk-up customers at the counter.  The bartender inside the restaurant though, not so friendly, but she was slammed with dessert drink orders.  \n\nIn all the hot chocolate ended up being okay but I have definitely had better.  For people in northern California, Ginger Elizabeth in Sacramento has the best hot chocolate, full of flavor from first sip to last and marshmallow flavor from first sip to - and especially with - the last.  Monique's Chocolates in Palo Alto has the next best hot chocolate in my opinion.  Their white hot chocolate tasted like the Nestle Alpine white chocolate bar which is my favorite white chocolate."

I like the NYC location better because it was more spacious, but Vegas definitely has its own unique ambiance that suited the restaurant.\n\nSo let's get down to the food:\n\nWhite Hot Chocolate- My favorite drink! I got this in NYC as well.  I added an amaretto shot just because it's Vegas and it was delish. \n\nMexican Hot Chocolate- Also a great choice--creamy hot chocolate with a bit of a spicy kick to it.\n\nChai Tea- Came in a self-press kettle for extra freshness. Was amazing as well, but I would personally go for a chocolate drink\n\nChocolate Pizza- I know this is what they're known for, but I definitely DID NOT like it :(...  It was waaay too rich and tasted like I was eating 3 bars of melted chocolate at once.  Definitely a must for the experience, but never again.\n\nSugar Banana Waffle- This is the second waffle I've tried here and I don't think you can really go wrong with any of their waffles. My favorite part is the small Erlenmeyer-like flask of chocolate that comes with it.\n\nBrenner Burger- Your typically restaurant burger.  Good for a burger, but not anything too special.  The waffle fries dusted in cocoa powder and the sauce it came with were my favorite parts.\n\nThings I love about Max Brenner other than the food: the service, the hug mugs, the alice cup, the restaurant's design (100% pure chocolate pipes everywhere, the \"you look good today\" mirror in the bathroom, the menu, etc)"

EVER.  \n\nWhile they try to pass off this establishment as a restaurant, the wiser customer knows that it really is just a front to indulge in your wildest chocolate fantasies.  We ordered a hot chocolate, hazelnut/chocolate frappe, and caramalized banana waffle smothered in chocolate.  Each was more delicious than the next.  And this is considering there were 2 meat-loving guys in our group!  Even more fun is their attached shop with all sorts of funky chocolate confectioneries and accessories, which certainly entertained us until our food came.\n\nAs an aside, we also got a panini and a burger, both of which were solid as well.  So there you have it, the best of both worlds!"

I'm the type of person that would skip straight to the desserts on a menu and will most gladly replace a steak for a cheesecake anytime.  Brenner has made the world easier for us dessert folk by intertwining some of his dishes with hints of chocolate and a list of his dessert dishes with chocolate hits.\n  \nFor example, The Black and Tan battered Onion Rings with Chocolate-Ranch Dipping Sauce... FaWhaaa???!!  The appetizer of hops infused glorious golden halos dipped in choco-tang was purdy darn deliciouso!  Another item I would like to highlight would be the Berry Lovely Martini.  The presentation of the dessert cocktail was a masterpiece and paired perfectly with Brenner's Burger.  It was just like having a burger and shake with a 'bit more shake!  We also had the Mac n Cheese which was accompanied by a Marinara filled Syringe up to 60cc's!\n\nWe rushed through lunch and ordered thru the desert menu like maddogs hyping for a sugarcraze.. The menu was so expansive and so inventive that we turned to the \"Close Your Eyes and Just Friggin' Point\" method.  The following are the selections Destiny has lead us to: (rated 1-5, 1 being freaknasty and 5 being The Max!)\n\n1. Marshmallow Hot Chocolate- 3\n2. Chocolate Pizza- 5\n3. Fondue for Two- eh\n4. Giant Chocolate Chip Cookie- 4\n5. Mexican Spicy Hot Chocolate- 5\n6. (Some Popsicle w Choco Pearls)- 5\n\nI'm not going to go into detail on each item, but I would like to express that Brenner's chocolate has brought all my senses to levels of satisfaction I never knew existed! \n\nSad to say, the only thing that was missing from the dining experience was the Oompa Loompas..."

You walk through the Chocolate Shop to be seated and walk through it again as you exit out.\n\nI ordered the Chubby Smoked Turkey Club with waffle fries. The dijon aioli was very good. The waffle fries was too greasy. But the turkey was very juicy and great.\n\n\"Satisfaction Guaranteed\" was my drink of choice. It is basically a chocolate martini. A cocktail/chocolate aphrodisiac. It came it this really cool martini glass without the leg inside a small bowl with crushed ice which kept the drink cold. And a side of caramelized toasted peanuts. \n\nAnd of course, how can you come here and not have dessert at the end. My friends and I ordered The Spectacular Melting Chocolate Smores Sundae. It was 4 of us and it was enough for each of us to have a few spoons of the sundae.\n\nAs you exit out, you can't miss the Chocolate Shop to have more chocolate.\n\nI really liked the style and decor of this place. It reminded me of an old ice cream parlor with pipes hanging from the ceiling with \"100% pure chocolate\" written on them. Unique place."

It could have used a little of their signature sweetness, maybe some cocoa powder for fun, but I liked what they were going for overall. \n\nOn the sweet side, I had the After Party Belgian Waffle, which was fine, but a real contrast to the Illegal Chocolate Pancakes, mainly as the waffles are two fairly tiny dollar pancake sized morsels with about two feet of whipped cream on top, compared to the truly hefty pancakes at the same price. It's no contest: love the pancakes, okay on the waffles. \n\nIt worries me that the joint is almost always empty, because I do really like Max and hope he stays in Vegas; that said, I think they'd do miles better somewhere like Planet Hollywood, Cosmopolitan, or Paris, as opposed to next to the snack bar in Caesar's Forum Shops."

It was a little skillet of cheesy heaven.\n\nSomehow we made room for a Chocolate Hazelnut shake in one of their signature Alice glasses.  It was good but we didn't really find the hazelnut flavor until we got the bottom of the shake.\n\nThe reason for the 4 star review instead of 5 stars really hinged on our server.  There were many times that our glasses were empty and he was too busy talking to another server to notice.  He actually walked to the table next to us and walked away without noticing that we had empty glasses.  We tried getting his attention unsuccessfully but thankfully another server noticed and brought us refills.   Unfortunately this happened more than once and we wished we had been able to give her the tip instead of him.\n\nThe food was so delicious that we wouldn't let this deter us from returning, we'll just request not to have him as a server."

I'm actually not a huge chocolate fan when I have the choice between chocolatey and fruity desserts but I certainly appreciate some tasty chocolate every once in awhile.  We went here for a light meal (I didn't even get dessert, which is unlike me...but I did get a custom box of truffles made for the trip home).\n\nWe had the sloppy Max sliders, the Brenner Burger sliders, and the Mexican hot chocolate with milk chocolate.  OH SWEET JESUS the hot chocolate was good.  We initially ordered one to share but the second I tasted it I knew that would not be happening.  We got one more but I tell you I could have drunk that stuff by the potful.  If you like a little bit of kick, DEFINITELY try that.  I was sad I couldn't buy some mix or something to take home.\n\nThe sloppy Max sliders were pulled bbq pork and DELICIOUS.  The burger ones were nothing special.\n\nThe truffles were not as good as the ones I got from Vosges also in Caesar's but they were tasty.  My favorite was the chili and cornflakes one and the hazelnut cream pecan one (or something...I tried to look it up on the website but I'm having a hard time finding the flavors).  The free samples of chocolate covered pecans were GREAT as well.\n\nNot super pricey either (for Vegas) so check it out if you're looking for a quick bite and something to satisfy your sweet tooth!  They had a ton of desserts including a syringe of chocolate you can directly inject into your mouth or onto your dessert or wherever (well, probably not WHEREVER...you might have to buy one to go if you get any crazier ideas ;)"

(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=MrvNywG_ed2VdWQhunk44Q&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw)\n\nHaving done my research on Yelp beforehand, I already knew that I was not going to leave Vegas without trying Max Brenner. Located inside The Forum Shops (part of and right next to Caesars Palace), parking was a little confusing at first because The Forum Shops has its own parking lot that's separate from Caesars Palace's parking lot (you have to circle down around the Colosseum). \n\nMax Brenner was surprisingly empty on that Sunday lunchtime..and that suited me just fine! Also, I was not expecting the restaurant, which looked unassuming and average from the front, to be so big and spacious inside. They had chocolate-themed decor inside (chocolate \"pipes\" running across the ceilings and walls, posters featuring chocolate, jars of candy/cookies, etc (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pMUkSaVSD9zUcP5KG_mOhA&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw)) and nice couches for people to lounge around, although I'm not sure when you will need to lounge around unless you're waiting for someone in the restroom (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=CutljJ3FFNhZLodcz9Y48Q&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw).\n\nEven though it was empty that day, service was still kind of lackluster. It took us forever to flag down our waiter to place our orders and get some cups of water...and there were only three tables that were seated in the whole place! I noticed that the other tables were having trouble getting the waiter's attention as well. Anyway, after we placed our orders and got our food, we hardly noticed the slow service because the food overtook our mouths, our minds, our conversations, and our souls.\n\nBanana Split Waffles (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ywqLRT_IZ8bQwUx1KUVkpg&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw) - Even though I would categorize waffles as a breakfast item, Max Brenner placed its waffle dishes in its dessert menu, so be sure to look through all their menus before you order! The waffles were amazing. Even though the portions look small, it was actually very filling. There were so many components to this dish I didn't know where to start! The caramelized bananas were super delicious and together with the crunchy chocolate-covered rice krispies, chocolate syrup, and creamy ice cream made the waffles send me into cardiac arrest and fly up to heaven!\n\nGuilt-Free Omelet (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2y5M9yOwQwEUDYB98aMaNA&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw) - So, we all know that Vegas is a fattening city. I don't even want to think about how many calories I took in just from the endless alcohol drinks and buffet food. It was only natural that my friend and I decided to appease our guilt by ordering the Guilt-Free Omelet. My friend substituted the eggs for only egg whites (at no additional charge!) and the omelet was amazing. Cheesy and fluffy, and filled with all these veggie goodies. The potatoes on the side were okay, but I liked the herb seasoning on them. The biscuit was AMAZING! Soft, buttery, and so so so good with their chocolate sauce (hey, cannot escape Max Brenner without tasting their chocolate)!\n\nIllegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=B51pIQ9RY-J-A1tBHQtLWg&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw) - Yes, there is THAT much chocolate that they had to put in the word chocolate 3x to do the pancakes justice! I would recommend that you split this with at least 3 people (and that is if you're only planning on eating these pancakes and nothing else) because they are huge and densely soaked in chocolate and syrup. Yummm..I can totally see why such a thing would be illegal, even in Sin City..\n\nHazelnut Cream Chocolate Milkshake (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=U05QfAZxZE0yhI1PaPogaA&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw) - At first my friend tried to stop me from ordering yet another fatty item, but I was determined to try a milkshake here. They had so many options (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zSuQ9qhGuAJbbxRuhhVgcw&userid=HDxFZKFQyL6ChxXkAbgETw) that I could not for the life of me believe I had to narrow it down to just one. Alas, I chose the Hazelnut Cream one because I love hazelnut in my coffee, in gelato, in anything. It was put in a cute \"Drink Me\" (Alice in Wonderland, anyone?) cup and my eyes popped open the second I took a sip. Best. Milkshake. Ever. Imagine Nutella in a milkshake form, but 100x better.\n\nMy other friends ordered a Brenner Burger (with Kobe beef), which came with some tasty cocoa-dusted waffle fries, and the waffle sandwich, which I was too full to try. \n\nMax Brenner, you were so worth the calories!"

Who cares what time it is.\" and gone with something ridiculously sweet with ice cream or something. Oh well - you live and you learn! Now I know for next time.\n\nBoyfriend got the Cande's Killer Breakfast Skillet ($14.95), which he really liked.

My initial reaction was excitement as all the rich chocolatel-y memories of my first experience at Max Brenner in NY came flooding back. The decor is basically the same but the NY store is obviously bigger/more elaborate.\nThe dessert menu is the same as the one in NY as well. \n\nI decided to try something different. I got the Mocha Frappe - and although the menu states \"Milk Chocolate\" our server asked me if I wanted Dark, Milk or white. Of course I chose dark chocolate :)  I didn't get to enjoy the hug mug this time but the Alice \"drink me\" cups were pretty cool!  The drink itself wasn't sweet at all and was actually quite bitter - but in a \"i'm-strong-espresso\" way. Delightfully refreshing. \n\nMy friend ordered The fantastic Popsicle Chocolate Fondue. I didn't know what to expect when it came but it was adorable! In three little bowls there was the melted chocolate, crunchy wafer balls & candied hazelnut crunchy bits. So basically it was like dip it yourself. The vanilla ice cream bar itself is a magnum ice cream bar - creamy and delicious. I could eat the crunch wafer balls & candied hazelnut crunchy bits by themselves. \n\nAND best part was that while we were waiting for our dessert, my friend went to purchase something from the store as a gift. When she came back and our server saw that she had a bag - she asked if we received the 10% discount. We were unaware of the discount and she promptly applied the discount and gave us our money back. Yay! :) \n\nMax Brenner is indeed pricey but it's a little price to pay for an extremely satisfied sweet tooth."

At first I had my doubts, cause I was suppose to be in bed, due to working the graveyard shift.  But, I promised her I would go, and try out something new.  I'm glad I did.  \n\nMax Brenner, located at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, is a chocolate filled extravaganza.  Its a good size place to eat, a good place to sit at the bar, or to walk by and get a snack.  It also has a second story, where you can have gatherings of any sort and I believe any size.  Well, according to Jocelyn, the sales & banquet manager, the upstairs gathering place, can fit up to 50, but with the Yelp Elite gathering, it was filled up with about 200 people.  So I'm sure they can probably reserve the place for more then 50 people.  \n\nNow, being there, has to be a nice feeling.  Not only for the fact that its a Yelp Elite gathering, but the Staff of Max Brenner made it special.  We had snacks, that were absolutely delicious, and loved the Chocolate Martini.  I felt overwhelmed with one of their waitress, Misti.  She made sure I had something to drink and went out of her way to make sure I had a drink.  Also it was great to meet Jocelyn, who was nice to come around and talk to us.  Despite how busy that night was, I was really impress with the service, the food and how friendly everyone was.  \n\nIf you're a chocolate lover, then Max Brenner is a place for you to check out."

There are too many crepes that simply become homogeneous flavor globs of thick sweetness (see: Jean-Philippe), so I was wary. To my surprise, the banana hazelnut crepe with the rice krispies had some great layering of textures and flavors. Plus points for creativity with the customizable add-ons served on-plate, although the presentation could be better and more cohesive. But still - a great crepe, one that makes my top 3 list. \n\nI like the atmosphere - it's understated for a Strip dessert joint, not too typical French, but not too hipster, either. It's a nice balance between casual and charming. The service is patient and friendly, though a bit lacking in the details - while our server was very personable and engaging, she did fail to provide us options for our order (dairy milk vs alternatives, type of chocolate, etc). I'd rather take that technical error than a fundamental issue with service, though, so overall the staff seems good. \n\nAlso appreciated the extra step they took in their tea service, using the new-style infusers with actual loose-leaf. Too bad the measurements were way off though, because the tea was excessively strong, which, flavor-wise, was the low point of my visit. This place just needs a little tweaking in the details, it seems; they've got some fundamental things right already! More of a 3.5, rounding up to a 4 thanks to the accommodating service."

I tried one of the shakes (technically some kind of grenada-something not a shake) and a hot chocolate, as I was between meals. The 'shake' was definitely a different style with the character of a raw chocolate powder based icee with rich dark chocolate with a lot of character to it, however it was just quite my thing, not creamy, not melt in your mouth irresistable, just very cold and strong. The hot chocolate was interesting (I would recommend it above the shake) with a very very frothy head to it. Again it was very rich, but I think that combines better with a hot beverage than a cold one, not my favorite but different and interesting. Probably I should not have tried both because they are strong raw chocolate with a lot more power than the usual stuff and I ended up with a headache later, but I did not want to miss the experience. Overall the italian ice at another very well reviewed vegas desert stop was more to my liking, but to each their own. For $5-7 to try a chocolate item though this place will cost you a lot less than most things in vegas though, so it is worth a try to see if it is your thing."

I noticed after getting seated that 2nd floor of  max brenner is actually prettier than the 1st floor for those of you who are into ambiance. \n\nFor the newbies like me who didn't know that they also offer food, that can be an option for hungry shoppers! As for me, after much debating, we ended up ordering one hot & one cold drinks: Italian thick hot chocolate & Pure chocolate truffle granita.\n\nSince you have the option to choose the type of chocolates, whether it be milk, dark or white chocolate, we ordered italian thick hot chocolate with milk chocolate & pure chocolate truffle granita with dark chocolate.\nA little tip (which is more of a personal preference) is that if you like sweet but not too sweet, I definitely recommend dark chocolate base because it was just more enjoyable! \n\nMy favorite part more than the actual drinks was the presentation. \nHot chocolate comes in their famous \"hug mug\" & their cold drinks comes in an alice cup that says \"drink me\" (isn't that so magical? i just really appreciate whimsical details like that)\nI mean, even the check comes in a nice chocolate tin can! It's so cute that you almost want to pay. . . .not that you have option not to, of course;;\nIn fact, I love the cup so much that I ended up bringing back a pair of these hug mugs & a bag of milk hot chocolate back home ;)\n\nI don't know about you, but you just need a cup of  sweet warmth on a cold day to lift you up!"

We went back again for waffle fries and spicy Mexican hot chocolate. Fries were good, the hot chocolate was too runny.

We asked for Alcohol recommendations and he highly recommended the Brazilian Breeze.  We ordered that along w a Mojito and Mediterranean Trio to start. Few min later he came back and we decided to order bunch of appetizers so we can have dessert. 15 min go by and no drinks, food, or sign of our waiter, so we asked another waiter to locate him. Over 5 min pass when he finally showed up with our drinks.  The Brazilian was the worst by far but didn't complain.  The food finally came out and he kept on disappearing again. About an hour and 40 min experience with zero time waiting for a table and 3 appetizers, 2 drinks, and a dessert we decided to go downstairs and pay the bill since we had it for 10 minutes and he still never came back and mind you the restaurant is almost empty considering it was almost 11 PM.  At the gift shop where I spent almost $80 I asked the employee there if we can pay the bill she kindly declined and said she would locate our waiter who later rushed over with who I assume to be the manager because they thought we took off.  All they cared about was the bill, neither one was listening to us complaining how we had to keep waiting for everything including the check.

I had their BLT with house-made fries and everything was just so perfectly executed, and  so generous in portion. My friends shared a goat cheese scramble of some sort, which was also very tasty.\n\nOk let's talk chocolate. Holy Shit. Here chocolate comes in every form, shape, size, color. It can be a drink, a cocktail, an appetizer, your entree, your dessert, or all of the above.  Since we were in Vegas, we could not skip the alcoholic part of the menu. I got the Mocha Madness which came with little biscotti type cookies and it was delightful. Usually chocolate & liquor drinks tend to hurt my stomach but this was not too heavy.  My friend got the non-alcoholic hot chocolate served in a special \"hug mug\" (yes it's soo cute) and it was so rich and decadent and rich and decadent and rich (did I say that already?). Borderline indescribable. We could not stop drinking it. Wow. A must order!  My friends also split the Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes.

I ordered extra fries (actually we ordered a second serving - there were four of us and they aren't that big).  They were fresh and as amazingly delish as I remembered.  The food came, was really well cooked again so no complaints there.\n\nDesert was a different story.  One person had the mini ice cream bars - she said they were delish (but wouldn't share).   The rest of us decided to share the chocolate peanut butter sundae (heaven) but the pizza we thought was nasty.  I just don't understand why other people rave about it - ours was doughy and blech.  The waiter was nice enough to take it off the bill though.\n\nI would definately recommend the Vegas one too (just don't go to Philadelphia :("

If it's anything chocolate, I'll go.\n\nService was slow, and we came in on a Monday afternoon when the place wasn't full. The server was nice though; we just didn't know why it took forever to get stuff going. Other than that...Expensive stuff: $100 for 2 people, with tip included. We ordered a choco frappe and hazelnut smoothie, 2 aps (spinach dip & wings), steak panini with waffle fries, and half order of the works chocolate pizza and churro fondue. Next time, skip the regular food and indulge in desserts!\n\nQuestion: What's with the small tables!? I felt like I had to do a balancing act while eating... put my plate on my knee there, put my frappe by the edge of the table and push it with my elbow as I eat to keep it from falling off...\n\nOther tips: Sliders are only from the bar, and Happy Hour is from 3-6pm. \n\nConclusion: I definitely would go back again, though just for dessert."

We were here on a Saturday and was told by the hostess that they only serve brunch, which had a specific menu.  Bummer!  The brunch menu didn't have the Really Cheesy-Really Crunchy Mac and Cheese my bf was dying to order.  Anyway, since one of the main reasons for this Vegas trip was to eat here, eh, why not?  Once we were seated, our waiter told us Hwe can order from the regular menu as well! Joy, oh joy!  \nThe bf loved the mac and cheese.  I, on the other hand, really didn't care for my mushroom and ricotta pizza. Meh.  But, kudos, on the Oreo shake that can came in this whimsical glass.  Wanted to order the popsicle fondue, but they didn't have popsicles.  Boo."

            "review": "Between Serendipity 3 and this place Caesar's has the Vegas market cornered when it comes to over-priced desserts and junk food. But, despite it being a tourist trap I wanted to check it out. Afterall, it's a tourist trap filled with lots of chocolatey goodness.\n\nI stopped by with my son for lunch and they tried to seat us at a tiny 2-top right by the entrance, outside of the actual restaurant. um... no, not a good choice. I asked to be seated somewhere else. They brought us inside and sat us at another small 2-top. I'm not one to bitch and moan, so we took it. It seems like most of the tables on the lower level are small (They have a second floor that I didn't check out). When you combine that with the large plates that everything is served on, it makes for a crowded and uncomfortable dining experience.\n\nThe menus are kind of ridiculous, both in a good and bad way. There's a spiral bound book that lists all the sweets. There's a separate menu for brunch, lunch and dinner with no entrees for less than $12. Even their sandwiches are $13+. Even for Las Vegas standards, I think that's outrageously pricey. Kids get their own menu with a pack of crayons.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Blackened skirt steak & mushroom quesadilla ($14.95) - filled with tender strips of steak, sauteed mushrooms, topped with salsa and sour cream and laying on a bed of thin tortilla strips. Mighty tasty, but I couldn't stop thinking that I was paying for a $14 quesadilla.\n\n- Kid's order of chicken fingers ($8.25) - 3 chick fingers with waffle fries. My kid loved them and the waffle fries were some of the best I've had. The meal comes with a paint brush. A couple of the waiters encouraged my kid to paint with the mustard and ketchup provided. Obviously, they don't have kids. If I let my kid do that he would have painted himself, me, the table and any poor soul passing by. It's cool that they encourage that because it makes for a fun, kid-friendly environment, but it may not be the best thing for a two year old to do.\n\nWe also ordered a lemonade ($3.50) which was kind of like a slushy and got a dark chocolate hazelnut shake ($7.95) to go. The shake was rich, creamy and delicious.\n\nWe were too full to experience their desserts (except for the shake), but I'd gladly come back to try one or two.\n\nThe service was excellent. We had a main server who was very attentive and eager to explain the concept of the restaurant and answer any questions. There were also a few other waiters who stopped by to see if we needed anything. Even the hostesses were very friendly. They gave my kid a couple temporary tattoos to put on later as we left.\n\nYeah, I would go back but probably just for dessert. I still can't believe I spent $44 (including the tip) for lunch for one adult and a two year old. I'm used to spending a lot for food but this was a little excessive.\n\n3.5 Stars"

A little on the high side for breakfast, but we figured for the Strip, it wasn't bad and decided to give it a shot.\n\nFirst, the smell. Oh sweet holy moses on the halfshell, it was DIVINE. The smoky smell of bacon wafting through the restaurant mingled with the rich cocoa scents and it was all just... sublime.\n\nOur server was Brenda and she was fabulous. Attentive, bubbly, not overly hover-y, she didn't rush us and she had a charming, dishy way about her that I loved. I could drink with her.\n\nI had the Huevos Rancheros Burrito which was scrambled eggs, chorizo, tomatoes and pepper jack in a red pepper (It was red, I'm just guessing) wrap.  It was served with some glorious house potatoes with a chipotle sour cream drizzled on it with pico de gallo. The whole thing kind of made my eyes roll into the back of my head. My toes were curling. I'm just sayin'.\n\nHe had the Lazy Breakfast of scrambled eggs, chorizo & onions with a side of the same potatoes (sans orgasmic chipotle magic). It was also served with a sugar-dusted buttermilk biscuit, a dish of softened butter and a \"lick\" (a small dish) of melted milk chocolate, which he added to his biscuit with the butter.\n\nHe loved his breakfast, but after tasting my burrito, wished he'd gotten that, but still raved for several hours about how good breakfast was. The sugared biscuit with the butter and the chocolate combo was brilliant.\n\nWe finished up, he with an 80's shake (vanilla bourbon ice cream, milk chocolate shake with a hard chocolate shell) and I with a Mexican hot cocoa (with cinnamon, nutmeg and other stuff).  Both perfect cappers to our meal. \n\nWe left full, satisfied but not sluggish and with plenty of leftovers which I whipped up into breakfast tacos for dinner last night.\n\nOur tab was $48, which is about double what we'd normally pay for breakfast, but we don't normally have milkshakes and frou frou cocoa with it, either.  But we both agreed: WORTH EVERY PENNY. (Especially since we got dinner out of it, too.)\n\nWe talked about that meal all day, how it put us in a great mood. The power of chocolate is mighty.

We had tried a few new places already on this trip, and had been left greatly disappointed, almost to the point where we were considering going to the Cheesecake Factory in the Forum Shops, even though there is a Cheesecake Factory 10 minutes from our house.  We were staying at Caesar's and wanted something close, as this was our last night in Vegas and we were pretty much \"walked out.\"  After scouring Yelp, OpenTable, and others, we ended up at Max Brenners, intrigued by some of the ways they incorporate chocolate into their meals.\n\nWe had made reservations for 7:30 on a Friday night, expecting the place to be mobbed.  We walked over and found it maybe half full, the entire upper level was empty.  Guess we didn't need the reservations, but it always makes me a bit nervous when a restaurant isn't busy at a peak time, but it's Vegas so peak times are going to be skewed a bit.\n\nWe had looked over the menu a bit at our hotel room, so my wife and I both kinda knew what we wanted already, but still spent time checking out our other options.  I went with the Brenner Burger, and my wife got the mac n cheese.  We skipped appetizers as we really wanted dessert.\n\nThe waitress was a little slow on keeping our drinks full, but she was overall nice and helpful in recommendations on the menu.\n\nWhen reading the menu I saw that the onion rings on my burger were \"black and tan\" onion rings.  I instantly thought beer battered onions rings, and figured they were something along those lines.  After taking a few bites of the burger though, and noticing some additional flavors I wasn't used to in a burger, I can only guess that the tan part was a regular batter for onion rings, and the black was chocolate.  The burger was very simple, but incredible.  I normally go a bit crazy on the gourmet burgers, but this one was nice and simple and very tasty.  The fries were also very good, the cocoa and chili powder complimented each other very well.\n\nThe mac and cheese was good as well.  My wife added chicken to it, which I might have skipped, but it was still very good and flavorful.\n\nThen came dessert.  My wife got some crazy chocolate cake thing, and I went with a White Chocolate Cheesecake Crepe.  I've never been a huge fan of the type of cake my wife got, but it was pretty damn good.  My crepe had a bit less white chocolate and cheesecake than I expected, there was an orange flavor that kind of empowered the other flavors, but still tasty.\n\nOverall it was a pretty good dinner, and the price wasn't completely outrageous like you find at a lot of other restaurants in Vegas.  And afterwards we got to walk through the Forum Shops and laugh at all of the trainwrecks in Vegas on a Friday night!"

If there were a business listed to review them I SO would. \n\nWe were greeted by a nice hostess and explained we were just there for dessert so she set the full menu down and brought JUST the dessert menu. She even gave us an option of a rectangle table vs. a round(we chose the round). The only inky part of the evening, and maybe only because I'm in the service industry, is it took FOREVER to be greeted! Our servers name was Honey(I think) and we were ready to order as soon as she greeted us. \n\nMy mom and grams shared a s'mores sundae(I posted pics!!), my friend ordered the banana split waffles, and my sis and I did the fondue tasting for 2!!!! Holy cowabunga batman and robin!!!!! I was soooo impressed when our dessert came out, all of us were impressed actually! Everything tasted divine and I was pleasantly surprised at how many accompaniments came with the fondue. There was strawberries, bananas, waffle, chocolate pound cake, chocolate bars, choco crispies, marshmallows, and fire to roast the marshmallows! \n\nI can't wait to go back!!!!! Thinking about it makes my mouth water!"

If you love chocolate, prepare to hit your cocoa climax.\n\n\nThe $5 Italian hot chocolate reminded me of the Starbucks' Chantico, which was discontinued a while back. It's rich, and more of a dessert than a drink. The size is about 6 ounces, but that is all you'll need. It's sweet enough to give you diabetes, but you'll find yourself looking for that rich chocolatey taste. I know I do."

I went 3 times in two days and each time it was AMAZING! \nThe first time we ordered the fondue with churros which consisted of mini homemade churros, raspberry sauce, toffee sauce, and dark chocolate. ALL YUMMERS! I got a crazy butterscotch shake which was like an orgasm in my mouth. We kne we had to return again for breakfast after looking at the plethora of menu options. I got an amazing goat cheese omelet and this insane frozen mini lemonade that I still cannot get over. Every dish come switch what they  call a \"chocolate lick\". Its a small ramekin with their custom melted milk chocolate. I am no a milk chocolate fan, dark is my thing, but I would drink that by the gallon and bathe in it as well. The service rocked and the ambiance was kitschy cool. I have told every chocoholic I know about it and me as well as everyone I have told is completely disheartened that there's not a MB anywhere in the Bay Area. That is beyond STUPID!"

The service was friendly and helpful, although it did take the a long time for a hostess to show up to the front for seating when we got there.  There were plenty of open tables, too.  \n\nWe went because my sister told us we should try it.  Apparently, she had a better experience with the dinner food than we did.  However, she did visit here about a year ago.  So something may have changed between then and now...  If you're going to visit, go for the dessert and chocolate drinks.  The dinner food was mediocre.  \n\nI had the Mushroom & Ricotta Pizza which was a very thin crust.  I like this style of pizza but this one was not done very well.  It was papery and flavorless.  It tasted like it came out of a box from the freezer.  \n\nMy kids had the The King of Chocolate's Crispy Mac & Cheese served with a pool of tomato sauce (it wasn't actually a \"pool\" of sauce.  It was served in a plastic syringe).  They liked it, but it really didn't fill them up (and they don't eat all that much in the first place!).  The serving size was small and almost $9 for a kids' meal!  Yes, the food is on the pricey side for what you get.  \n\nMy husband had the Brenner Burger with the waffle fries.  The burger was actually decent, but nothing special.  It was just better than what I was having (the pizza).  The waffle fries were nothing special either.  Chocolate dust?  I looked and looked.  Tasted and tried my best find it but couldn't find any chocolate.  It tasted like the waffle fries you can get from Carl's Jr...  Sorry, but it did.  \n\nWe had the Mexican Spicy hot chocolate with dark chocolate.  It was delicious.  Pricey, but good.  Also tried the Hazelnut Cream Chocolate Milkshake because of all the positive reviews.  It was good, but we've had better.  It was nice to try these chocolate drinks at least once though.  \n\nWhy an \"A-OK\" rating and not a \"Meh\" rating?  Three words-- Banana Split Waffle.  OMG!!!  The only thing we at our table truly all enjoyed.  The waffle was crispy on the outside, soft in the middle.  This was cooked to perfection!  Ice cream, caramel, and chocolate ganache with bananas and the chocolate rice krispies were soooo good.  \n\nSo although we would never go back for dinner, we would probably visit again for desserts and a taste of different chocolate drinks.  \nOverall-- \nDecent and helpful service\nMediocre dinner food\nGood-to-try-at-least-once drinks\n& Yummy desserts (at least the banana split waffle) that will make you coming back for more."

The food was overpriced for small portions and nothing special.\n\nI had the Alfredo penne pasta, some fondue for two, as well as a couple of slices of my friend's oven roasted tomato pizza. The pizza was VERY thin crusted and had a thin layer of tomato sauce as well as some pieces of cheese and tomatoes spread evenly across the top. It was honestly like a few sheets of paper stacked on top of each other for ~$14.\n\nAs for the pasta, it was again, nothing special. There wasn't really anything wrong with it other than the fact that it was ~$16 for like 4 bites. The taste was okay and was probably the best thing I ate there.\n\nFinally, the fondue for two was ~$25 for a plate of some strawberries, blueberries, bananas, a few brownies and cookies, marshmallows, and a scoop of ice cream. It was hardly worth the price.\n\nMy experience here was really disappointing and did not meet my expectations. The food didn't taste bad but it was definitely not worth it. I will say that our waiter was very friendly, patient, and talked with our group a lot. If it weren't for him, I'd probably rate this place 2/5. I don't expect to be coming back any time soon."

It was delicious and I'm only sorry we couldn't have more.\n\nAnd we couldn't have more because the service was just AWFUL. We were there on a weekend night that wasn't even busy, and it took them 15 minutes to get us napkins, another 15 for them to bring us more water (had to ask twice for both), and our dessert never made it to the table. We only had the chance to order one appetizer because our waitress didn't check back on us. Never got to order another round of cocktails either. When we finally decided dinner was over and maybe we still had some patience for the much anticipated dessert, another 20 minutes passed before my friends husband decided to get up to cancel that order and just hand them our credit card to pay for the bill. And then THAT took them another 10 minutes. Manager never came over. \n\nWe thought about going back the next day for our dessert in hopes that the service would be better, but we decided against it.

It's a bit of a trek to get to the restaurants, but trust me it's totally worth it!@\n\nWe got a table upstairs right by the balcony as our group was fairly large. Our server was very attentive and sweet. For drinks, I got the dark chocolate mocha....sooooo amazingly good! I've also had their regular dark hot chocolate before and it definitely doesn't disappoint. Whatever you order, definitely try something from the chocolate drinks menu! My favorite thing besides the delicious chocolatey drinks are the cute and clever cups that the drinks come in. I love their hug mugs as it is made for optimal drinkability and warmth! I even purchased one of the hug mugs so I can repeat the wonderful experience at home!\n\nFor food, I ordered the Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate pancakes. OMG!!! If you love chocolate and pancakes, this is the dish for you! The pancakes come with dark chocolate shavings, caramelized bananas, spiced pecans, and more melted white chocolate for drizzling! I was definitely in chocolate heaven after my first bite! I also tried my friend's After Party Belgian Waffle. The strawberry honey and melted white chocolate that are on the waffle are to die for! I also highly recommend the Cinnamon Apple & White Chocolate Truffle Cream French Toast. \n\nIf you are not a chocolate or sweets person, don't worry, they got plenty of savory dishes to choose from as well.

My girlfriends and I started with two white chocolate chai, one being with soy milk.  When our server brought the drinks out, I asked which one was with soy milk, and received a \"I think it's this one?\" in return.  Strike one.\n\nWe hone in on what we want to order.  I ordered a Lazy Breakfast with sausage, cheddar cheese, and onions, and the girls ordered their plates.  We waited for about 20 minutes, and our server returns with plates in hand.  I take a peek at the meal, and notice it's bacon with no onions.  My girlfriend's order was also incorrect.  Strike two.  We informed our server, and he immediately took the plates back, and had the manager come by to let us know that it wasn't our server's fault, however the fault of one of the chef's in the back.  He apologized and let us know that we would be receiving our meals in a few moments.\n\nWe waited for another 15 minutes for the food to arrive.  At this point, our third friend was nearing the end of her meal, and we were just beginning.  Whatever, no big deal.  We're making the best of it at this point.  We stop our server and ask for ketchup and extra napkins.  He gives us a thumbs up and replied that he would be back in a few moments.  We waited for about 10 minutes before we flagged another server down.  Strike three.  **You're Out!**\n\nThe food was mediocre at best.  It was a simple egg scramble with sausage, cheese, and onions with a side of country potatoes.  The only part of the meal that was unique was the sugar biscuit with the side of chocolate fondue.  It was pretty decadent for breakfast, but still delicious.\n\nAs we were nearing the end of our meal, we ordered two mochas to-go (one with soy milk, once again), and asked for the check.  After another 10 minutes of chatting and waiting, our drinks come out with the bill.  I ask our server which of the two drinks was the one with soy, and once again I'm faced with a blank stare.  Strike one.  I give him my card to pay for our meals, and he returns after a few moments with the receipt.  I take a look and notice that he's overcharged us on our bill.  Strike two (but I suppose I should have looked at this prior to giving him my card.  I'll call this strike one and a half.)  We point out the mistake, and he promises to alleviate the situation.  He takes the receipt and leaves our table for another 20 minutes to speak with the manager to fix the amount.  Strike three for the amount of time we've been sitting at the restaurant with the intention of a quick breakfast prior to leaving Vegas.  **You're Out!**\n\nOur server arrives back and theatrically rips up the receipt stating that it wouldn't be charged on my card, and that the transaction was voided completely.  He notifies me that he would return with the proper receipt with the updated amount.  While he's away, I check my Chase app to find that my card had indeed been charged and placed on a hold.  Strike one.  I understand there are certain policies in place, but it would've been much more appreciated if he had correctly informed me realistically of what was going to happen: you're going to be charged, we'll refund that amount after a few days, and you'll be charged again for the proper amount.  After his return to the table, I showed him that it had been taken out of my account.  I'm once again faced with the blank stare that I've grown accustomed to during this visit.  Since for some reason I wasn't able to obtain a receipt of the voided transaction, I asked for something in writing stating that the amount would be refunded.  He leaves for another 15 minutes to acquiesce my request.  Strike two because we've been sitting here frustrated for close to two hours.\n\nI end up paying once again and speak with the manager who has already come by our table for the food mixup.  I ask if there's any way I would be able to retrieve a copy of the original receipt, and he declines.  I ask about the timeframe on the refund, and he states that it should be applied by the evening.  He became defensive stating that this \"happens all the time\" and it's \"totally normal\".  He then goes ahead to blame my bank for the pending charge and takes no responsibility.  Strike three, **You're Out!**.\n\nThis appears to be a shut out, ladies and gentlemen.  Max Brenner, you are bad and you should feel bad."

We're going to Max Brenner.\"\n\nAfter parking the car at the hotel, we wandered over to the Forum Shops at Caesars, where Max Brenner is tucked away near the back (across from the mega-H&M).  The place was fairly empty at lunchtime, so the two of us had no problem scoring a second-floor balcony seat overlooking the crazed capitalism going on below.\n\nEven before our server came by with menus, we were intoxicated by the chocolate aroma that permeates the place.  We were hungry even before we sat down; once the chocolate tickled our noses, we were ravenous.\n\nThe menu is ginormous.  There is enough \"real\" (non-dessert) food to pull you in multiple directions.  The dessert menu is even worse -- it's practically an encyclopedia of drool-inducing chocolate delights.\n\nTo start, we ordered the grilled chicken panini.  I'm a sucker for a great panini, and this one was more than just great -- it was heavenly.  Gooey cheese, a nicely crisped roll, and the most intoxicating tomato aioli.  It was served with a side of waffle fries dusted with cocoa and chili powder, which is possibly the best twist on French fries that I've ever enjoyed.\n\nWe also shared a side of white corn croquettes.  These beautiful bites were absolute perfection.  Crispy panko breadcrumbs on the outside, silky smooth corn and manchego cheese on the inside.  I could eat dozens of these and never tire of 'em.\n\nAs amazing as the these were, the single most revelatory dish was dessert: chocolate chunk pizza with hazelnuts and bananas.  It's as decadent as it sounds.  I've never had anything else quite like it.  And, obviously, the best way to wash down chocolate is with more chocolate, so I sipped on a \"hug mug\" of Mexican spicy hot chocolate, which ranks among the finest hot cocoa ever.  (I loved dessert so much that I had a cookie to go -- thanks for the tip, Michelle T!)\n\nThe Max Brenner gift shop is almost as fun as the restaurant.  Lots of free chocolate samples there, along with surprisingly reasonably priced dishware and boxed chocolate to go.  The best part: chocolate moisturizer that makes you hands silky smooth while smelling like an ice cream sundae.  (Yeah... I took some of that to go as well.)\n\nCan you tell I'm completely bowled over by Max Brenner?  Next time I'm looking for lunch in Las Vegas, I'll definitely be returning to this veritable castle of chocolate.  Take it from this chocoholic's mouth: Max Brenner is a no brainer."

Max Brenner became our pick after Serendipity had too long of a line. \n\nMax is located across the GIANT H&M inside Caesar's Palace (is it the real Caesar's Palace?). The minute you walk into through the doors you can smell the chocolatey goodness. But, if chocolate isn't your thing they have a lot of savory food choices as well. But where Max really shines is obviously in the desserts. \n\nWHAT WE ORDERED:\nWhite chocolate and strawberry smoothie: Incredibly rich and actually a tad overwhelming! I think it tastes better once it melts down a little. The consistency makes it hard to drink at first.\n\nFantastic Popsicle Chocolate Fondue: After seeing the picture in the menu, I was intrigued. What a fun creative twist on a fondue! Unfortunately, it no longer features popsicles. It is now plain old vanilla ice cream in a waffle cone, but you still get to sprinkle your choice of toppings on it. \n\n\nMax Brenner's chocolate is SERIOUSLY one of the richest chocolates I've had to date. Normally, I'm a sit down and eat 3 bars of dark chocolate kind of gal, but I can't see myself pigging out on Brenner's stuff. \nBonus points for having a mini shop in the corner where they give free samples! Way to fatten me up Brenner!\n\nI'll definitely come back just because the menu is SOOO massive and I'm really intrigued by his waffle fries and cocktail items. Until next time Mr. Brenner!"

Stopped in here on a whim after being lured in by chocolate samples.  What really grabbed our attention was the restaurant's mood.  After a long day shopping on the strip this place seemed like the ideal place to relax and get a dose of chocolate infused caffeine before heading out for the night.  I had the dark chocolate mocha served in the hug mug and was really surprised how much I enjoyed using this interesting take on a mug.  The service here was really good.  They were able to find a table for the 4 of us at the last minute next to the bar despite it being incredibly booked.  I wish we had one of these in LA."

It is one cool place to visit that's for sure and the chocolate gift shop is pretty awesome...especially those chocolate syringes :P The vegas location isn't as big as the NY one, but still a pretty restaurant, which isn't surprising because it is in the Caesar forum shops. To be honest, I like chocolate, but an excessive amount of chocolate just seems a little to saccharine for me. And that's kind of what it feels like in Max Brenner's. Like you're Augustus Gloop drowning in Mr. Wonka's chocolate river.\n\nSo we tried the famous \"Chocolate pizza\" that this place is known for. And it really wasn't anything too special. The crust was kinda...meh. Like the edges of a pop tart that no one really likes to eat because it's so bland. That's what I thought the crust tasted like. We got the works, which is every thing on top...so marshmallows, chocolate, peanut butter, drizzled caramel...basically ingredients of your favorite chocolate bars laid out on a pop tart crust for you to cavitate your teeth and be your dentist's dream come true. And it was just okay...I felt like I could have made that at home if I really wanted to. Key word = if. \n\nWhat was partially redeeming were the banana split waffles. This was actually pretty delicious and it even came with a cute little mini beaker/flask of chocolate syrup to drizzle to your delight over caramelized bananas atop vanilla ice cream and mini waffles. Plus a little bowl of those crunchy rice krispy-like chocolate balls. Mm...this was sweet but balanced well with the bananas and vanilla ice cream. \n\nOne of my friends also got a burger which actually looked quite delicious. (He attests to this) we munch on some of his waffle fries which were also good...and hey, if you did want to grab a bite of real food and not diabetes, you could still try their menu for other food! The server was really nice and overall, it was still a fun experience. I probably would come back for the banana split waffles (to split with friends of course) but everything else on the menu seemed just a little too chocolate-y for me. But if you're a huge chocolate fanatic, by all means, this is probably the place for you!"

However the execution (especially of the Union Square one in NYC- crowded with tourists, dirty) falls short.

They have it twice daily, from 3PM-6PM and later from 9PM-Close(11PM).  They offer a few appetizer, drinks, and desserts for $6 a pop in the bar area during these times.  \n\nI ordered the Brenner Burgers off the happy hour menu ($6).  It was the perfect amount of food for me.  It came with two cheeseburger sliders and two waffle fries.  The sliders were bomb.com.  I'm not sure what made them so good, but it probably had something to do with the onion ring and the cheese :)  My dining partner had the \"Best BLAT\" (14.50).  It was not the best.  It had a ton of bacon.  I would only recommend it to people who are really big fans of bacon, because that taste overwhelms everything else in the sandwich.  It wasn't on the HH menu, either.  \n\nTo drink I had the Chocolate Martini and WOW!  It was better than I could have imagined.  The balance of alcohol and chocolate was exceptional.  It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.  I also had the mojito because I'm a lush, don't judge me.....the first step is admitting it.  It was alright, but next time I'll stick to their chocolatey drinks. My younger sister had the Satisfaction Guaranteed drink, which was similar to the martini, but with a hint of carmel/peanut taste.  It was served on a bed of ice with a small bottle that had the leftover liquid and some peanuts on the side.  Our other dining partner, shout out to Julie K. (the white one lol), had a white russian.  This is their best selling drink and I can see why.  It was served with two marshmallows and looked really tasty.\n\nThe service was inconsistent.  The bartender was busy, I guess, so I'll give him a break.  Next time I hope it's better.\n\nAll in all, Max Brenner is putting out some quality eats and drinks.  I'm looking forward to visiting again to order off the regular menu."

Cheesecake Factory (also in the the Forum Shops) is always super busy, but even there already great desserts (I love cheesecake) can't compare to Max Brenner. Brenner's might be a little bit more - but def worth a visit, especially if you're a tourist."

Everything about my experience was outstanding....Walking up to the restaurant allured me with the aroma of chocolate.  They must fan it out into the forum shops.  If I had to be nit-picky, the only thing I would say is that the stools are not the most comfortable seating...but the staff was amazingly helpful - ask for Danielle, not only is she gorgeous but soo helpful and freindly.  (She's getting props from her co-workers after seeing her name again in yelp, I'm sure)  :D\nThe food spoke to me & I ate so much I was full for the rest of the next day!! lol We ordered a bunch of things off the menu to try and there wasn't one dud.\nMac & Cheese, the Brenner burger & the pulled pork sliders were excellent.  The milk chocolate hot chocolate and the butterscotch milkshake, YUMMMM!!!   Food coma!\n\nI will without a doubt tell everyone to check this place out. The only one on the West Coast.  And I will certainly go back as often as my waistline will permit me to.  FAT KIDS HEAVEN!"

As good as it gets!\n\nBack in the late 80s, nike ran a campaign featuring Bo Jackson. \n\nIt proclaimed \"Bo Knows\" and went on to enumerate all the things Bo knew, including but not limited to football, baseball, and Ray Charles. \n\nMax Brenner knows chocolate.\n\nI can't count the number of times I've been here. \n\nBreakfast, Brunch, Lunch, Dinner, Snack-time, Cookie-stop while shopping at the forum shops.... \n\nYou really must try the chocolate fondue \"sharing\" @  $24.95 for two at least once. \n\nAnd buy yourself a $5 cookie to go. It's $10 if you eat it inside because it comes on a plate with a dollop of cream, some berries and chocolate sauce. \n\nAnother thing: sometimes the service is uneven. It's not a fine dining restaurant, so it comes with the turf. Spend some time reading the menu and the whole Max Brenner story. It will make you want to quit your job selling widgets and apprentice in a tiny Parisian chocolate shop with a crotchety Gitane-chain smoking chocolatier named Gaston. \n\nThey don't really open early enough, or close late enough, and lately, they got rid of the little mini-stand outside the restaurant to make room for more fake-patio seats, but those are my only beefs, and they are fairly trivial and easily planned around. \n\nEven the non-sweets are good.\n\nThe omelets are solid, the potatoes are well-seasoned, and everything is certainly quite edible.\n\nBut stick to the sweets, like chocolate pancakes for breakfast, the aforementioned fondue sharing, and the cookies and cakes and you will be very pleased. There's this hot chocolate here that you need to try. Ask for a sample of each kind before you order to get a taste of each variety, and you will know which one I am talking about. \n\nDon't come here if you dislike sweets, and write a review complaining about how sweet everything is. That's just asinine. \n\nThe whole point of eating here is to assemble a meal like Will Ferrell makes in Elf, and spend the rest of the day bouncing off the walls on a crazy sugar high."

It's like Trina Turk came in here and waved a magic wand.  That was a plus.\n\nI had the Southwestern salad with lots of avocados in it and a lime vinaigrette.  For dessert we split the Churro Fondue.  I love churros and with the milk chocolate, caramel, and raspberry sauce, I was very much in a heavenly state.\n\nOur server was very engaging and nice but I felt like she and her bus staff had road runner legs.  At a sit-down restaurant, I don't like to be rushed and I don't like the bus boys trying to take stuff away all the time like I am eating too slow.  That there is the minus star.\n\nOther than that, I would recommend this to chocolate lovers for sure and for those looking for a lot of lite fare options.  The latter is great for those who want to replenish just the right amount of energy to get back to shopping Caesar's or throwing their life savings on the pass line."

Unfortunately for us, this chocolate kingdom proved to be more paradise lost than paradise found.\n\nWe thought this would be the perfect place for DD (turning 9) on her bday, since she's a chocoholic. Everything started out promising, with oodles of chocolate drink selections from which to choose. Both her and her younger bro ordered kids' oreo shake. Not sure they used real oreos, as the flavor was off. Strike one.\n\nWhile waiting for food the four of us really wanted water. (We all ordered specialty drinks, but sometimes you need some water to counter the sweet.) Should be simple enough, right? Hmm. Where's our server? Any server? Bueller? Bueller?? Ten minutes later, we finally get someone's attention. (Mind you, the place wasn't tremendously busy.) Strike 2.\n\nKids were SUPER excited about the \"decorate your own pizza.\" Menu said it comes as a cheese pizza with lots of toppings with which to decorate. The pizza arrived on a cute wooden board, with a small dish of about 5 cherry tomato halves. Nothing else. Not olives. Or pepper.  Or anything else. Seriously? Just a few tomato halves to \"decorate\" a kid's pizza. Strike 3.\n\nOn top of that, the food was barely mediocre (think fast food, drive thru quality despite steep sit down prices). The Greek salad was more parsley stalks (yes, stalks) than lettuce, the \"feta\" was unflavorful, the dressing was off, the olives were small smashed pieces.\n\nThe onion ring batter was pretty good, but the rings were greasy.  And a big no-no in my book: they were ordered as appetizer, but took forever and showed up seconds before main entrees.\n\nThe kids' pizza was a bit greasy, unflavorful and had a soggy crust. (Think Pizza Hut thin crust sitting out too long.)\n\nThe club sandwich wasn't bad at all. If you are suckered going into this place, it's a fairly safe bet. \n\nWant a better bet?

The mango slaw didn't appeal to me, and the white sauce was watered down. Yech. \n\nDessert - Strawberry Hazelnut Cr\u00eape: What I *should've* had for dinner. The strawberries paired with the chocolaty hazelnut sauce were delightful, and it's large enough to share with one other person -- but do you really want to share it with someone else?  \n\nService - Both my friend and I dined here on a Thursday evening after the 6 o'clock dinner rush. Not many diners were there, so it makes me wonder why service was such a drag throughout the evening. We also placed our orders first ahead of another party that was seated after us, but they received their meals before we did. \n\nOverall - Not a restaurant I'd dine at again if I were at the Forum Shops. If dessert's for dinner, then I might reconsider, but their dinner menus didn't do it for my appetite."

Anyway, I can't help but try the place after reading all the reviews and having the hot chocolatey aroma seep into my olfactory system from at least 200 - 300 yards away. \n\nWhen I came here I knew I had to have both savory and sweet to satisfy my cravings. After all, I'm not in Vegas too often. \n\nFor the savory, I ordered the chicken and goat cheese salad. The salad came with balsamic vinaigrette and was topped on a huge waffle.  The chicken and salad was decent, and the waffle was definitely a nice touch.\n\nFor the sweet I ordered the banana split waffles. It came with crunchy caramelized rice crispy bits. Bananas were chocolatey and sweet. I would say the fruit itself was sweeter and stronger than the added chocolate and caramel, if the makes sense. This is a good thing. It means the dish isn't too sweet for most people.\n\nOf course, I was unable to finish the meal even with added help on the banana split waffles. This was essentially both my lunch and dinner.\n\nI also couldn't resist ordering an original hot chocolate with white chocolate. It was a bit too thick for me. Good thing it was comparably a small size to the other drinks. I couldn't take too much of it, but it was good.\n\nWe had an informative friendly server. Nothing like good service at a restaurant. Makes you feel welcome and at home.\n\nOverall, I would say the food is decent, but all the chocolatey choices definitely make it a unique restaurant that I will definitely return to next time. I still have to try the chocolate pizza's and fondue."

The chocolate I can't even give an adjective that would even describe the way the chocolate tasted.... I thought European chocolate candy bars were amazing - but wow! This is like the premium of all chocolate! I will never eat chocolate the same ever again... I'm jaded!

At least someone's reservation was recorded. So we sat at a tiny table and proceeded to be waited on  by the most disinterested and rude waitress.  Don't remember her name but she had a 16 tattoo.  She was not in the mood for any questions on the dessert and could not be bothered to give us some direction on the fondue.  She should have explained all the items included along with the best way to enjoy the dessert.  It's Valentines Day!  This is supposed to be an experience. We ordered two desserts including the fondue and it barely fit on the tiny table and we were constantly worried we would catch on fire from the flame on the fondue tray.  Oh and that bigger table we had requested that was \"reserved\" sat empty the whole time.  Not the place to go for a special evening or really ever.  We'll stick with Raku Sweets."

A salted caramel hot chocolate! And it was exactly as I pictured it in my head. Super DECADENT and RICH! You could tell the chocolate was very good quality. The caramel was infused very well. The one thing that I thought was missing when I took my first few sips was the sea salt. I didn't find out till later that it was in the foam at the top! So remember to mix it well! My only gripe was that it was very sweet because it was so rich. I would recommend sharing, or maybe getting an iced version? The ice might help dilute it.

The waffle was cold and didn't have much flavor, but a fork full of banana, waffle, chocolate, caramel and ice cream was really scrumptious.    By the time the server showed up we had eaten about half of it ( it was plenty for two).  So i mentioned to her that the waffle wasn't warm at all, and she replied \"but the banana was warm right? \"  and walked away.   She brought us our bill and then vanished for about 15 mins,  we gave our payment to another server finally and we just wanted to leave at that point.  Overall, it was decent.  I would like to go back and try the breakfast."

I had the Sharing Fondue and good luck sharing it with the recommended two people. You'll be begging for more, trust me! It comes with a serving of ice cream, fried banana bites, fondue, marshmallows and more. They give you long forks so it's easy to roast the marshmallows and dip it in chocolate. We had the dark chocolate flavor and it was awesome. Sometimes dark chocolate will taste overly bitter, but nothing like that here at Max Brenner.\n\nTowards the end the sugar will catch up to you but it wasn't overwhelming. You definitely leave feeling more satisfied rather than simply sugar-rushed.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the regular dishes such as the pizza is great as well. I had the Spicy Chicken with 3 Cheese Pizza. The portion is pretty small, but it's darn good pizza. Thin crust and crispy exactly how I like it!\n\nExpect to spend in the +$40 range even for just two people. It's definitely worth it though, can't say enough how good the chocolate fondue was. Definitely going back in the future."

If you do NOT enjoy chocolate nor the fancy presentation that will come with it, you probably won't feel like you've died and gone to chocolate heaven :).\n\nYes, the prices seem up there because you think, it's just chocolate.  Let me tell you, it's not JUST chocolate here!  \n\nHoney and I came here thinking they only served desserts.  They actually offer real food!  We were so bummed because we were searching for a place to eat brunch and couldn't find anything appealing.  Next time we are definitely going to check out their non chocolate offerings because not only did everything on the menu sound delish (fancier offerings than your basic breakfast), we witnessed people eating and we were looking at their food with longing.\n\nWe had already eaten and honey is not a real fan of just eating sweets so it was all on me.  The pressure!\n\nI first ordered a drink to try.  Ha!  These aren't just drinks...they're an adventure!  My $7.50 Mocha Frappe (milk chocolate truffle and espresso shot) was offered in their Alice \"Drink Me\" cup with the metal straw.  The metal straw kept my very thick mocha cold to the last yummy drop.  It wasn't overly sweet so I was able to finish it.  He thought I was going to get sick finishing that and eating a dessert.  I did prove him wrong thank you very much!  Okay, I did feel a bit nauseous later but I would do it all again in a heartbeat.\n\nI ordered the Chocolate Surprise Tiramisu.  The lady fingers were espresso soaked and sitting in extremely thick cognac mascarpone cream.  So thick was the cream that your lady fingers would break in half when you pulled them out.  You had to use a spoon to eat the lady fingers with the cream.  The chocolate truffle surprise was a warm gooey thick chocolate drink in the cutest mini glass pitcher.  I felt like a giant Alice drinking it.  Thinly sliced ripe strawberries were given as a taster in a teeny \n\nChocolate overkill?  Yes, yes it was.  \n\nTheir mini gift shop is in the same restaurant space.  I wanted to buy it all!  The hug mug and alice cup are the 2 items I'm going to indulge in buying next time.  I regret not buying them when I was there MDW.\n\nOh Max, how I miss thee!"

The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace is medium sized mall filled to the brim with the latest fashions and also is home to several restaurants.\n\nOne such restaurant, is Max Brenner's Chocolate by the Bald Man.  This place came highly recommended and so we were excited to give it a try.  As a certifiable chocoholic, I was surprised at myself that I actually almost walked right passed this place.  I suppose my eye was drawn across the hall to the massive, three-story H&M clothing store.  However, my nose did not fail me and my eye quickly followed me back to the sight of Max Brenner's.  The place looks like Willy Wonka and Wolfgang Puck had a brain child.  There is a childlike playfulness to much of the decor but with a crisp and refined edge.  \n\nOne glance at the menu and we knew this was going to be a special meal.  Surprisingly, there was a lot of care and detail put into the flavor and presentation of the savory dishes.  I honestly expected these to be a loss, so this was a plus.  The winner and the reason I will return is the dessert.\n\nThere are page after page of delectable options.  We settled on the *Sharing fondue and the Crystal Sugar Churros fondue.  Both sets came to the table stylishly displayed, but not at the cost of real chocolate experience.  There were fruits, cakes, churros, other chocolates, and even pieces of waffle to dip into several different flavors of warm molten chocolate placed on the table by the waitstaff.\n\nService here is excellent.  Most places in Las Vegas are missing this component.  Max Brenner must either pay well, or be a truly enjoyable place to work.  It s a remarkably enjoyable place to sit and enjoy an amazing dessert and people watch.  As you leave Caesar's casino head into the Forum Shops and veer left, trust me your nose will guide you the rest of the way to chocolate bliss."

Unfortunately, it wasn't really a lava cake as I had hoped. More just a slightly (and I mean slightly) under baked cake with a dollop of caramel inside. I still really enjoyed the presentation and the rest of the plate. They made up for the lack of liquid in the cake with a shaker of chocolate ganache to pour over the cake. Mmmm, melted chocolate :). The ice cream was delicious and a nice accompaniment. My absolute favorite part, though, was the milk chocolate shot. My goodness that was good!!!  Mmmm.  I also really loved that this location was soooo much more relaxed than the madhouse that is the NYC location. We were able to sit and relax and enjoy our chocolate without a million other people mulling around. \n\nThey were also giving samples of cocoa pecans in the shop which were delightful!"

Their items can add up to a small fortune rather quickly (the family of four in front of me dropped $70 on their \"pre-meal munchies,\" as they described them).

And all of this was supposedly for 2 people!!\n\nMy favorite of the bunch had to be the banana split waffle. The waffle was so crisp and the bananas were perfectly caramelized. The egg roll was also interesting because it tasted Chinese-y... I think it had 5 spice powder in it? Of course, I had to order a glass of milk and it came in the absolute cutest cup ever with a straw holder. And how convenient that they sold these cups in the shop because you know I had to get one.\n\nI was surprised by how many people were eating the \"regular\" food here.

I took my mother here for her birthday because she can never get enough chocolate. you could probably put an IV of chocolate in her bloodstream and she wouldn't fight you on it. ever! Everything is good here from the food to the chocolate desserts to the drinks. My mother is not a drinker, but the guy that seated us overheard us singing her happy birthday and brought us all out a berry shot. I wish I knew the name because everyone at my table loved it. (including my non-lush of a mother.) I also shared the satisfaction guaranteed drink with her which she sipped up as it tasted just like hot chocolate. you couldn't even taste the liquor in it. YUM! We shared a peanut butter sundae that everyone went to town on. I highly recommended trying it one evening. My dad and friend shared a chocolate beer trying to give something new a chance. They do not recommend it. Something about it did not catch their fancy, but everything else was super. I am counting down the days until my anniversary later this month, with the boyfriend, so I can take him to experience his first fondue. (i know it will win him over fast!) I took him to a yelp event here last week and max brenner won over his heart with their delicious food (mini pulled pork sliders, philly cheese steak sliders complete with cheesewiz, max brenner cheeseburger sliders, pomegranate cosmos, giant pillow like chocolate chip cookies and brownies, banana split waffles, everything mouth watering.) you can see my previous review on it with CMYE. I also think everyone should try the brunch there on the weekend. if it is anything like the new york one you are in for a treat. it is excellent and you wouldn't even think so since they are known for their desserts.\nall in all i recommend this place for a birthday treat, for a romantic dinner and dessert, a pit stop for snacks and drinks, well heck i just recommend it for anything because you can get away with anything there and leave a happy, chocostuffed, person."

So we got there about 4pm to make sure we had time to enjoy happy hour for a while.  \n\nUpon arrival, we asked the hostess if happy hour was only available at the bar, or if we could sit down at a table.  To her credit, she told us it was her first day, and she didn't want to give us the wrong information.  So she went and quickly collected the answer to our question and came back.  Happy hour was at the bar only.  No problem.\n\nFirst, we started with a couple drinks.  My pregnant wife got a frozen lemonade, while I tried the Classic Chocolate Martini ($12.50 normally, $6 on happy hour).  Both were outstanding!  I decided I should try something else, so I went with the Intoxi-Cake with white chocolate, also quite good.  \n\nWe ordered some sliders and chicken tenders to start off the food, and while my wife thought some of the food items were infused with chocolate, I couldn't taste it  (She, of course, could have been misinformed).  We then ordered the Cheesy, crunchy mac and cheese which had tomato and bacon.  Ooh, it was excellent, although I was getting so full I couldn't finish it.  \n\nMy wife needed to have her dessert, so we got the banana tempura with dipping chocolate.  I couldn't have any because I thought I would explode, but she loved them and I tried them later at home and, even cold, they were delicious!\n\nWe had a 3-year old Groupon that had expired, but I knew it was good for the amount I had paid for it.  Since they didn't really have a way to honor the Groupon in their system, they just took enough items off the bill to equal the amount I'd paid for the Groupon. \n\nThe service at the bar was excellent, and the food (especially the chocolate items) was everything I hoped it would be.  They even offered us a chocolate sample on the way out!\n\nWill I go back tomorrow?  No.  But anytime I have friends/family in town and they are looking for something unique and sweet, Max Brenner's will be my recommendation!"

With just the sweet aroma wafting through the atmosphere as I entered this place, I knew I wouldn't be able to resist anything and everything that I could fit in one sitting.\n\nI should have been warned: \"Be prepared to drool.\"  Every single delicious bite had my mouth wanting more.  I started off with the Choco-Pops, a hot milk chocolate drink with chocolate wafers..  Really hit the spot.  I found it hard to stop sipping out of the tiny hug mug in which it is served.  I also had a quick taste of the Hazelnut Cream Chocolate Milkshake.  If that was mine, I would have gulped that whole thing down.  Not too sweet, and creamy so you don't have to sip too hard on your straw to get to your milkshake.  For an appetizer, we had Molly's White Corn Croquets which, with the dipping sauce it comes with, were a great start to an amazing meal.\n\nFor my entree, I decided on the Sliced & Diced Steak \"Pillow\" Panini.  The bread, incredibly soft (not soggy) so that it doesn't scratch the roof of your mouth when you take a bite.  Inside the panini was just the right mix of ingredients of steak, onions, spinach, tomatoes, and asiago cheese.  So great, I could savor every part of the sandwich with every bite.\n\nThen, for my DESSERT ... OH DEAR GOODNESS TO GRACIOUS the DESSERT!!!!  So many choices, not enough room to fit it all in.  Honestly, I had the hardest time picking knowing it would be a while before I could go here again.  After much deliberation, I chose the Banana Split Waffles.  Great choice, Tiff!  Give yourself a pat on the back!  Imagine it with me ... waffle, bananas, carmelized rice crispies (which I have to say turned out to be the best part of the dessert), chocolate wafers, and a chocolate syrup to top it off that I couldn't help but slather it all across this ultimate dessert.  Every bite was heavenly.  I also had a bit of the Melting Chocolate Truffle Heart Cake and the Deep Fudge Chocolate Cake.  Both equally delicious and mouthwatering treats!\n\nI am not embarrassed to say that I looked forward to burping for the rest of the day because I could still taste the chocolatey goodness for honestly the rest of the day.\n\nHow have I not known about this place before?  Forget it.  Let's forget about the past, and start dreaming of the next time we'll meet, Max Brenner."

Or, you can go to Max Brenner for dinner and return later for dessert, which is exactly what we did.  \n\nWe started off the evening with the white corn croquettes, black and tan onion rings, and the grilled asparagus crepe.  The croquettes were crispy on the outside and nice and creamy on the inside.  It was a wonderful contrast.  The onion rings were tasty, but not really anything special.  On paper, they sounded interesting and unique (black and tan beer battered vidalia onion rings with a chocolate ranch dressing), but in the end, they were just onion rings, albeit pretty good ones.  The crepe was rich and cheesy, and big enough to share.\n\nWe didn't save room for dessert, but not to worry, because we'd already planned to return for it later.  The dessert menu looked fabulous, but since we were Max Brenner virgins, we decided to go with the Tasting for Two.  It came with the banana split waffle, fondue, chocolate sponge cake, milk and white chocolate bark, a crispy chocolate eggroll, chocolate wafers, and chocolate sauce.  It was decadent and delicious, and we thoroughly enjoyed it."

It was suggested to us by our waiter and it was an awesome addition to make the dish out favorite of the night! \n\nThe steak panini wasn't as good as we had expected it to be according to the other reviews.., it deserves three stars out of five. \n\nThe elevator smells ridiculously funky... Do not use it to get to the upstairs bathroom. The bathrooms were so gross.... There was only toilet paper in one of the stalls and that stall had various toilet papers and other paper trashes strewn on the floor.. The towel dispenser was broken as well so I had to air dry. \n\nI got the omg cookie for dessert, the cookie was a brittle/ crunchy cookie, instead of the soft cookie I had expected, but it softened up after I drizzled the chocolate sauce on the cookie. Overall, it deserves something like a three stars. \n\nMy bf got the s'mores concoction on the sweet icons page of the dessert menu and   Seemed to really like his dessert. \n\nBoth were really sweet though. \n\nThree stars because it was only the Mac and cheese that impressed us that night, and because we were seated in an obscure corner of the restaurant even though there were plenty of better tables free as well. \n\nI liked the new York max brenner restaurant I had visited much much more than this one and will go there instead of here if I ever feel the urge to forge on chocolate again!!"

The man is a genius. The menu items are mixed with tradition and funky combination to savor and enjoy. I ordered the tasting for two despite I was only one person. How else was I to sample a little bit of everything? I really had no shame. Included in what looked like the last meal of my life was fluffy chocolate sponge cake, which looked like a brownie but lived up to its name perfectly. I had the one crispy chocolate egg roll with spicy peanuts inside. It may sound unusual but it was very, very tasty, with a little kick. It also came with a whole fondue setup where I picked dark chocolate to dip my roasted marshmallows and strawberries. There were also some white and milk chocolate barks which I took to go(a strategic move on my part). But the most unique thing in the tasting was the Banana split waffle. It was this tower of waffle and caramelized bananas with toasted rice crispy chunks and bourbon ice cream. It comes with a itty bitty glass jar of warm chocolate to drip over it and tiny chocolate crunch balls. I mean, seriously delicious. My mouth is watering again. This place is a must for me. Thank YOU Max Brenner.\n\nFor more on my dessert blog, http://weaknessforsweetness.tumblr.com/"

It must've taken at least 20 minutes of meandering the labyrinth that is the Forum shops to get here. The place was so hard to find! It may have been due to the previous night's shenanigans.\nFood:\n1) Huevos Rancheros Sunrise Breakfast burrito was soo good! Eggs, spicy chorizo sausages, tomatoes, pepper jack cheese served with home fries. This was one of the better spicy chorizo sausages that I've tried. The home fries were uh-mazing! I only wish the portions were larger for the price we were paying.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/max-brenner-las-vegas?select=9lB5ksGR8JzyTny1S0JROQ#976wPqYtH4eN3HC-7pLbEA\n2) Cande's Killer Breakfast Skillet consisted of eggs, sausages, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, spinach, home fries, and mushrooms scrambled together on a skillet. It didn't taste any different from the scrambles I've tried elsewhere. The only thing that really stood out from other establishment was the home fries, which I mentioned above. I'll probably try something or the burrito the next time I come for breakfast.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/max-brenner-las-vegas?select=9lB5ksGR8JzyTny1S0JROQ#aDEY-bnNeYQ3_AQhBL97Bw\n3) Crepe consisted of hazelnuts, chocolate, and fruits. I've plenty of delicious crepes, but none of the those can compare to the hazelnut that was used here. It was decadent and it simply just blew my mind.

Nestled in the food courts of the Forums at Caesars, you'll find this chocolate lover's haven.  Hate chocolate?  Then starve!  Just kidding, there are tons of great options, and you never have to touch an ouch of cocoa.  But you disgust me.\n\nMax Brenners are scattered throughout the world, and this is the closest one to Southern California residents (of which I am one).  The restaurant itself is straight out of Willy Wonka, except without the insanity.  The hot chocolate is piped throughout the building (not real, obviously, but very interesting to look at), and there are two levels of seating to guarantee that this place will never become completely overrun by customers.  \n\nThe menu is superb.  I've ordered the Oven Roasted Tomato Pizza and the Southwestern Caesar Salad, which comes in a funnel-like bowl/plate.  Both are excellent, and are better than one would ordinarily expect from a chocolate-centered property.  \n\nBut if you leave without ordering the waffle fries, you might as well have stayed at home.  They come with an addictive mustard-cocoa powder dipping sauce that tastes like God punched me in the tastebuds and said it was Good.  I always order an extra side (even though they are somewhat pricey), because someone at home is going to want a handful.  \n\nThey also have about a dozen coffee, hot chocolate, and dessert options.  Honestly, although these were good (I've had the hot chocolate and the classic milkshake), they're not the reason I keep going back.  I expect them to do their specialities well.  But you could skip actual chocolate and still have a memorable experience.\n\nThe service is generally solid, and they do take-out orders, too.  My fiancee and I have a pair of their \"Hug Mugs,\" custom-made hot chocolate cups that are laughably impractical but still fascinating.\n\nPunch-line: go at least once.  I think you'll like what you find, whatever your tastebuds crave."

We were seated very quickly upstairs soon after speaking to the host. However, it seemed like we were the only party up there. Hence, the bad service. \n\nIt took a really long time for the food to come out (about 20 minutes) and I only ordered potato skins. Granted, I've learned it takes a long time to cook and we had a big group, but these guys are pros compared to my cooking am I right?\n\nOnce we got the food, I took a nice whiff of the baked potato skins before I dug in. They smelled GREAT. I took a picture before I got to it. Then, I picked one up and started munching away. This was the first time I've had them and I was surprised that something so simple could taste so good! I told myself that once I got back home, I'd try to make some on my own. Turns out that it's a bit harder than expected. I can make bacon cheese fries but I definitely have trouble making baked potato skins.\n\nIn terms of food quality and taste, I could give these guys a 5 out of 5. Honestly, it was their service that brought the mood down. We were all extremely hungry and the fact that it took 15 minutes for them to come back up and take our orders then another 20 to push out that order was a little too long. I guess that's what we get for ordering real food in a chocolate specialized restaurant. We didn't have time to order dessert at the end, unfortunately.

However, we restrained our sugar cravings (and wallet... as its not the cheapest cocoa on the block) and shared a \"Fantastic Vanilla Ice Cream Cone and Chocolate Fondue\" and a warm mocha.  The \"Fantastic\" was essentially a little mini-bar of chocolate wafer balls, rich milk chocolate fondue, and toasted candied hazelnut bits to top the vanilla ice cream cone.  Heaven on a cone.  My mocha was also rich and delicious, and since it also comes with chocolate cream, no extra sugar was required.  The drink comes in a cute pear shaped \"Hug Mug\", which allows you to hug your drink close with both hands for optimal sipping.  How sweet is that?

The presentation is fun and the branding is superb. Other than that, not that impressed.\n\nThe salads are ordinary. The pastas are boring. The sandwiches are mundane. In a word - blows.\n\nThe desserts aren't the best in the world, they're just placed in cute vessels and rest on fun little platforms. Imagine a Winne-the-Pooh birthday cake. Everything is placed in something that resembles the hunny pot. Like I said, perfect for a bachelorette party! No one cares about the food, just pictures with desserts that look good.\n\nI'll admit, the drinks are pretty darn tasty. No complaints.\n\nTake the girls, not the boys."

Turns out our experience was anything but relaxing. \n\nInitially, we were seated promptly by the hostess and waited. And waited. And waited. We sat there with our menus with no one taking a drink order. Our waitress shows up and tells us that she'll be right with us. Afterwards she just disappeared on us again. Another long interlude passes.\n\nAt this point, I was thinking about chewing on a napkin and wondering if I should just get some water upstairs from the sink in the bathroom. \n\nFinally she shows up and takes our orders. Water takes forever to come and so does our orders. We stayed at the restaurant for 2 hours... for them to make a plate of eggs, a burger with fries, a waffle and a fried chocolate egg roll. Plus, there's an excessive heat warning outside and they take forever to refill your water glasses (which are surprising tiny - their hug mugs hold about as much liquid). I think in the two hour time span, they got refilled once. May I remind you, this is while you are eating some incredibly rich food.\n\nThe real food itself is okay (ie, the burger and the omelette). Nothing earth shattering.\n\nThe dessert tasting is both overwhelming in richness, underwhelming in quality.  I think in the end, the dessert tasting really lacked a good editing eye.\n\nTasting includes: a belgian waffle with syrup, caramelized banana, nuts with choice of ice cream and chocolate ganache; fried chocolate eggroll with Mexican spices ?bananas and peanuts; two different chocolate \"bark\"; a bowl of chocolate krispies; a fondue set with strawberries, bananas, and marshmallows (and hibachi for roasting).\n\nThe belgian waffle is too overloaded with stuff. First, you have the syrup, nuts and caramelized bananas. Then you drown it in ice cream and chocolate ganache? The waffle at this point is totally lost in the whole process - becoming soggy from all the ingredients. It's just too much.\n\nThe fried eggroll was filled with a chile pepper spiced chocolate with banana and peanuts inside. Albeit it was different and interesting, the eggroll became soggy from the chocolate inside.\n\nMy husband and I found the two chocolate bars and chocolate covered rice krispies (supposedly malt balls but I didn't taste any malt flavouring) to be too sweet in combination with everything else. The brownies were okay, not great. \n\nThe fondue (dark chocolate, baby!) was alright. We were wondering about the fire hazard we were going to create because flame kept setting our marshmallows on fire.\n\nHonestly, the dessert tasting is okay - would probably share it with 3-4 instead of 2 because it is really too much for two to handle. However, factor in all the other things like crappy service I have to say a 2 star review."

To be honest, I feel like I could've went someplace better. \n\nI'm gonna start this review with the BEST thing about this restaurant which is our waiter for the night. I didn't get his name, but he was so friendly towards our party and even gave me a birthday treat as a surprise! He was funny, nice, and didn't have a problem with us teenagers being loud. He was the best. \n\nOkay, now the food. I shared an oven roasted tomato pizza with my friend for $14 and it wasn't appetizing. The bread was super thin and it looked like it was drenched in tomato sauce and a couple of slices of cheese here and there. It didn't taste like a pizza, more like crackers with tomatoes. I could make it with a freaking easy bake oven. \n\nI also got the fondue for two, I think it was the one with the most items in it. The dessert platter came with a bunch of fruits, marshmallows, banana tempura, cookies, brownies, a chocolate shot, and the fondue. It was all really good in my opinion! Fun to play with and it all tasted yummy as well! My only problem was that it was $25 and I just think that it can be a bit cheaper. I guess I should've known the food here would be expensive considering the fact that it's on the strip."

I was told about this place by a friend of mine, so we went.  The place looked amazing.  It seriously felt like Willy Wonka's factory for adults.  Chocolate everywhere, a very dark and brown ambiance.  It worked.\n\nWe only went for dessert so we ordered popular items that we heard about here on Yelp.  Let me breakdown we got:\n\n+The Works pizza... Surprisingly good.  It tastes much better than it looks.  I was worried at first when I felt a soft crust but it was perfect.  For about $17 it was a great price.\n\n+Dark chocolate cookie... for $10 it was surprisingly worth it.  It was seriously the best cookie I've had in my life.  Hands down.  SO GOOD.  If you come here, don't go cheap, get it!\n\n+Hot chocolate... I got milk chocolate and it was bombbbb!  My buddies got some spiced one and we didn't really enjoy that.  The hug mug was really cool\n\n-Chocolate syringe... pure chocolate, in a syringe.  Didn't think it was worth it, but it was fun to have haha...\n\n\nPrice is high but you get what you pay for.

I am not sure, but I do know that I have a new guilty pleasure: The BALT (the bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato sandwich). I am pretty sure there is at least an entire avocado on this masterpiece of a sandwich. I have pretty much stopped eating bacon, but I make an exception here. I tell myself that I am getting all of the good fats associated with avocados as I proceed to consume the entire thing. I rarely finish every bite of a meal, but I have finished this entire sandwich twice. Sad little BLTs, you can only aspire to be half as tasty as the BALT.\n\nB is for Beverages: Previous to the arrival of Max, every single time I visited the Forum Shops I would become angry at the lack of exciting beverage offerings sans alcohol. I wanted a smoothing or an iced tea or something interesting and refreshing, and it simply did not exist unless you wanted to overpay for an Italian soda. Now, there is the ultimate refreshing beverage available for $3.50, a lemonade granita. It is a lemonade, mint slushy that is a magical elixir of refreshment. They also have smoothies and a wide variety of chocolate drinks. The hug mug is adorable, and the perfect little thing to cuddle during a little first date convo. I had a white hot chocolate with soy in a hug mug, and it was cozy.\n\nC is for Cheese... just kidding, clearly it is for Chocolate: Honestly, I am not a chocolate freak, and if you see me here, it is because the BALT has been calling to me, but you will find plenty of chocolate goodness at the bald guy's place. \n\nI also really enjoy the music here. They have some great bossa nova numbers and other eclectic tunes that make my ears happy. The bar is also a great place to grab something quick and watch TV. There is only one TV, but the bar is small, so if you're sitting at the bar, you'll be able to see the TV. \n\nOne last thing: They also know their Ws, which stands for Waffle Fries. Actually, if I had one complaint it would be that they don't provide enough of these cross-hatched beauties with their sandwiches.\n\nGo for the chocolate. Stay for the BALT!"

Lemongrass Tea - Not impressed. The presentation with the tea pot diffuser was awesome as was the raisin biscotti.  However, the tea had very little taste for the price.\n2. Italian Hot Chocolate - My friends loved it but beware that is it much thicker than American hot chocolate.\n3. Black and Tan Beer Battered Vidalia Rings - Best item! Onion rings dusted with cocoa powder and accompanied by a chocolate ranch sauce.  Just a hint of beer in the batter and chocolate in the sauce.  Kudos!\n4. Cinnamon Apple and White Chocolate Truffle Cream French Toast - Not overly sweet.  I'm not a huge sweet breakfast fan so a bite was good enough for me. \n5.  Lazy Breakfast -  Do get the spiced home fries.  Slightly dry but well seasoned.  Aside fromt that, it's your typical breakfast.\n6. Sliced and Diced Steak Pillow Panini - Perfect amount of ingredients, well toasted and perfectly pressed bread.  Not too rich or creamy.\n7.  Original Waffle with Tomatoes, White Corn, Goat Cheese and Chicken - It was an arugula salad tossed with cherry tomatoes, white corn, goat cheese, thin sliced chicken and drizzled with a balsamic vinaigrette on top of a waffle.  The goat cheese wasn't overpowering and the waffled soaked up the goodness of the vinaigrette and flavors.  Good but I'd try something else next time."

The guy making it was pretty awesome too! He showed us all the stuff that went into the shake and had a great sense of humor. We got to talking about how the employees had to try the first slice of every pizza to ensure it's oh-so-goodness... I, of course, said I would be happy to try! I was joking, but he pulled out a slice, cut it up and we were swarmed by people wanting to taste the chocolate pizza. It exceeded my expectations... that thing was awesome! Pizza dough and some good old chocolate slathered on top. YUM! \n\nThis is a place I will HAVE to come back to when I go to Vegas.

Chances are that once in the Shops, it's 99 in 100 for Mr. Brenner to be easily found; otherwise, he'd be sort of opposite of 3-story tall H&M. Quite surprisingly, we had no wait to get seated & be treated with splendor from our inviting & ebulliently informative waiter, George.\n\nThat said, out of the dessert menu plus the savory option & wine list, we agreed to share 3 different entities: a shake, a savory (for our \"balanced\" meal :P) & of course one chewable, sweet temptation.  Like many of my foodie friends she didn't mind taking turns with, firstly, the Hazelnut Shake ($7.95).  For that price, yea that milkshake better be damn delicious, and I was more than damned with that perfectly sweet & thoroughly nutty taste, with the venti-sized consistency that was in the middle of In-N-Out thick & borderline watery.\n\nFood sort of aside, I do want to get into nitty gritty details with service.  Not only George naturally delivered those aforementioned traits, but his warm confidence w/ our decisions brewed our trust in him.  His recommended Black Sesame [Crusted] Salmon ($18.50) was rightfully delicious with its moist cut-like-butter texture, added with generous amounts of that flask-used soy sauce & eensy weensy bit of the superbly tasty wasabi aioli that it will NOT AT ALL elicit that nasal side effect.  More impressively w/ overall service was that after George candidly asked us if our entr\u00e9e should split w/ a separate plate, we didn't expect that BOTH of our 1/2 portioned, perfectly cooked 'lil salmons were already beautifully & thoughtfully presented, unlike bringing one whole entr\u00e9e to cut it ourselves.  My filet was frankly diminutive, compared to the amount of veggies, but I was fine w/ it, so that we could save much more tummy room for, of course, what we came for the most.\n\nAdditionally we trusted George with his 2nd opinion of our desired chocolate treat.  Oh, emm, gee we also made the correct choice with that O.M.G. Chocolate Chunk Cookie ($9.95)--so awesomely presented in a platter that looks like graphing paper.  This saucer-sized cookie alone had the textures that I've totally dreamed of in a perfect chocolate chip cookie: crumbly & chewy on the outside, moist & absolutely chocolaty on the in, WITHOUT going insanely absurd with sugar, and with effortless hints of walnut chunks & noticeable brown sugar flavor.  THEN the O factor came through when I added that luscious & choco-gasmic sauce in a flask; the M was for encompassing the ripened berries (including my favorite, Yelp buds ;D); and when I dashed that assumingly house-made whipped cream, the G factor strongly excelled & stimulated my choco-chip cookie crave.\n\nUnderstandably the money marks might be quite high for such foods, but Max Brenner deserved a 4-star savory WITH the aioli, 4-star shake, & an absolute 5 for service & for that dream-come-true heavenly--or should I say hellish--Cookie that frugal me retorted to my friend, \"Uhh eff it, I worked this much to [use check card instead of credit card] for this dinner.\"  So Mr. Bald Chocolateur, thanks for gluttonously ending our Vegas weekend \"right,\" & thanks for having me clear off one of my many Yelp Vegas bookmarks."

I'd come here.\n\nThe grilled cheese sandwich for kids has the sandwich triangles skewered into a tower which I thought was cute. The sliders were yummy and the hot chocolate is very good. Onion rings are tasty. \n\nThe house cocktails are fun and I always leave with a small tin of chocolate pecans. Great gifts though they just raised the price of the chocolate syringes 20%. \n\nYou'll feel it in your wallet when you come here but it'll still taste so sweet."

Comes with a side of waffle fries. =) \n\nI want to say the menu changes -- because I see photos of items not on the menu. \nThey have a whole dessert menu dedicated to chocolate -- waffles, drinks, fondue, ice cream, chocolate chip pizza. =) If you don't want to dine in, they have a small counter right outside it for a quick order.\n\n$$$$ So, as much as I liked this place, it was pretty expensive. Sandwich was $17, which you could get at Earl's (at Planet Hollywood) for $6/$7 (w/o fries). The hot chocolate WAS delicious, but at $6 for a small cup, I might just venture over to starbucks or coffeebean.$$$$\n\nMAX BRENNER OWNERS -- make a peppermint hot chocolate!!! =) It'll be perfect for the holidays!!"

I started off with the White Russian drink since they said it was their most popular so I had to see what all the fuss is about. They add warm white chocolate to their drink which isn't usually done and makes it unique. It also came topped with marshmallows which I thought was cool. It was very tasty! For my entree I got the tutti frutti waffles which were waffles with an assortment of berries on time drizzled in chocolate with syrup and rice krispie type candies on the side. It was amazing! I would recommend this dish to anyone who loves fruit and waffles. \n\nI want to come back here again because they have a variety of things to choose from. I also heard that their mac and cheese is awesome so I want to come back for dinner. And if I come back for dinner I can sample one of their awesome desserts as well-see you again soon Max Brenner! :)"

It came with waffle fries with chili and cocoa powder on them and a side of aioli, delish. Their BLT and spicy chicken pizza is also incredible and worth trying. But back to the reason I'm giving the place 2 stars, the service. My server went way beyond trying to just be friendly and made myself, and my family, completely uncomfortable. He told us that no one likes him and even shared that the restaurant is closing soon (who tells their customers that?!). I think after awhile he realized that he was making us tense and left us alone. After our meal, we decided to check out the small chocolate shop section within the restaurant. The girl giving out free samples of chocolate was incredibly rude. SHE asked ME if I'd like a sample and as I was about to try it she yelled out to me \"You're welcome!\" Implying that I was rude for not saying thank you. It actually shocked me a bit so I apologized and said thank you. Two seconds after, she did the same thing to someone else. I quickly walked out of there without expecting to ever go back. It's upsetting when you find a restaurant where you actually enjoy the food but their service makes you hesitant to go back. Oh well, they're closing anyways."

Our dinner date coincided with filming for the Food Network show \"Kid in a Candy Store,\" so not only did we get to indulge in scrumptious sweets, we also were filmed for the show while eating it  :-D\n\nI HIGHLY recommend the Banana Split Waffle...imagine this: a delectably perfect belgian waffle + creamy vanilla bourbon ice cream + carmelized bananas + crunchy chocolate rice krispy balls + a mini jar of Max Brenner's famous melted chocolate (for dipping) -- TIP: You MUST ask for a side of the peanut butter sauce, it is seriously delicious and goes great with the waffle. \n\nI am salivating just thinking about this. We came back a second night in a row JUST to have this same dessert again. \n\nWe also tried: \nPeanut Butter Chocolate Fudge Sundae: bananas, rich chocolate and dulce du leche ice cream, peanut butter sauce, whipped cream, nuts...seriously, how can you go wrong? You get your money's worth with this sundae, too. It is ginormous. PLENTY of dessert for two. \n\nMeaty, Crispy, Cheesy Pizza: It is as the title suggests. We ordered this because we felt like we should put a little \"real\" food in our tummies before stuffing our faces with chocolate. \n\nToffee Hot Chocolate: Oh-so-creamy and yummy.

If you come here and are somewhat interested in the fondue, get the sharing fondue because that option comes with the little flame to make your smores and you get all the same elements (chocolate, marshmallows, banana, etc) plus a bunch more desserts to sample and dip into their chocolate! \n\nUgh, don't you guys hate when you don't order correctly at a restaurant?! When in doubt, always yelp. ALWAYS. But there was no service (freaking Sprint) so I was outta luck.\n\nNot that the smores weren't good, but they weren't spectacular. So run of the mill I don't even know why it's on the menu. This is a restaurant with a mission statement dedicated to chocolate, a key player in the dessert world, so I expect every dessert to be superb. \n\nAnyway, their shakes are super decadent and tasty but also really heavy. I didn't want to move after a couple sips of my friend's hazelnut shake. Definitely a place to share dessert or you'll be slipping into a chocolate daze for days :D (no pun intended) \n\nDetermined to go back and splurge on dessert with the sharing fondue next time."

We eventually decided to share the \"melting chocolate truffle heart cake and shake\" which is basically a tiny lava cake.  Even though it's small it is very rich and filling.   My sister and I could not finish it because we were just too full.  But oh was it the most amazing chocolate piece of heaven!

I think we've hit the Sunday morning bliss trifecta.\n\nI came here with friends who had been before and loved it, and while I completely trust their recommendations, I wasn't sure if I would be as head over heels for this place as they were because 1. I wasn't sure I was sold on eating chocolate so early in the day (I know, I know, as I write this it sounds crazy - any time is chocolate time, right??) and 2. they were all about the desserts, which, with me being gluten free, wasn't as big an attraction. But I needn't have worried. The strictly brunch part of the meal alone impressed me enough for a return visit, and that was even before the sugar coma. I had the Mexican omelette with cheese and black beans wrapped around avocado and topped with salsa. Perfectly done, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. Also I love that I had the option of fruit as a side dish - most places would charge an extra $5 for that. It was a fairly generous portion of fruit, too, and best of all came with chocolate dipping sauce. All of the sudden it didn't seem too early for chocolate.\n\nFor \"dessert\", I had the do-it-yourself hot chocolate which is steamed milk served in a mug that is set atop a tea light candle with the chocolate chips on the side. The candle kept the milk hot so you just add in the chocolate, stir, and voila! Even more decadent, I tried a sip of my friend's Italian drinking chocolate, which we described as almost like drinking ganache. Unbelievably rich and awesome. \n\nFun times, good food and chocolate. All situated in a giant mall in which  to shop off those calories afterward. Now I get it."

LOL. they started giggling and grabbed our hands and put some chocolate on the backs of our palms. lickity split- it was amazing! we were sold.\n\nwe split Max's Sandwich of the Seas- a salmon burger which was quite delish. we washed it down with a chocolat-ini and a chocolate beer. we weren't too impressed by the beer, and we looove beer too. we were expecting more of a chocolate taste. \n\nanyway, on top of the great food, the service was excellent as well. \n\nwe ended up going back the next day for dessert with my family. one big MEH. we ordered the chocolate pizza with marshmallows, peanut butter and banana's. it would taste good if the toppings weren't placed on thick, rubbery bread. we also ordered a waffle with vanilla ice cream, caramel, and banana's. MEH. the waffle was stale. \n\ndefinitely go for drinks and food- the ambiance is great. i'm willing to go back and taste more desserts though! so max brenner mission to be continued..."

The moment you walk into the restaurant you are hypnotized by the magical aroma of sweet decadent chocolate! :) It was my first time ever and I know I will definitely be back again.\n \nI had the:\n - Sloppy Max Sliders which were a real treat! Perfect pulled pork deliciousness!\n- Chocolate Chai Hot Chocolate which was perfect to the T! Light, creamy and full of so much flavor! The chai gave the hot chocolate a hint of cinnamon spice which was lovely!\n- FONDUE: Crispy Chocolate Eggroll with banana chocolate filling, creamy milk chocolate dip and sea salt caramel sauce!\n- Chocolate chunks pizza with bananas and hazelnut which was soooo good! Excellent crust and a good amount of ingredients!\n\nOf course I shared all of these goodies with my friends but by the end of the meal I was completely chocolate wasted and satisfied! \n\nCheck it out -- I highly recommend this place for those with or without a sweet tooth! There's something delightful for everyone! I plan on going back again the next time I'm in Vegas or New York or wherever else they have a Max Brenner -- i'm there! :)"

This is a cute restaurant with a chocolate shop connected to it in the forum shops. \n\nI love love love coming here for dessert. The chocolate fondue with a platter of goodies such as strawberries, marshmellows, chocolate chip cookies pieces, and spongecake is perfect for sharing with your date. \n\nI ordered the I Scream vanilla bar dipped in chocolate sauce and chocolate pieces before. So delicious! It melted pretty quickly though so I had to eat it kind of fast. \n\nI have also been here for lunch and the lunch items are delicious. I have had their salads and a sandwich, both cooked well and served nicely. I definitely like suggesting this place to friends who enjoy a great meal."

I thought to myself - what is this place and I have definitely got to try it out! Sure enough, we ended up coming here twice for desert in our 3 day stay in Vegas :). \nThe first time the hubby and I chose to share the chocolate fondue which consisted of fresh fruit (bananas & strawberries), cookies, brownies and marshmallows. The dark chocolate was so delicious and made everything taste even better! \nThe second time I chose the chocolate molten \"cake & shake\" and the hubby got the chocolate pizza. My cake & shake was yummy and so rich I could hardly finish it. The choclate shake comes in a little shot glass and it was so yummy - I could definitely get that alone in a larger size! \nThe hubby did not enjoy his chocolate pizza. The crust was not sweet by any means and was definitely pre-baked and not baked to order. It definitely tasted stale. I'm sure if the chocolate pizza was baked on a fresh pizza crust it could have been very yummy."

I expected something more like a casual restaurant that specializes in chocolates BUT they proved me wrong.\n\nThe restaurant decor was really cute and modern. I would definitely say this would be a cute date place where the wallet doesn't have empty much. Average price is $13.\n\nThe food was amazing delicious. We had the burger, club sandwich, quesadilla, waffle fries. All were very yummy. The meat in the burger was cooked perfectly. \n\nThe desserts? i can't even start. During our meal they let us try all the malt shakes. Soooo good. and for dessert? the Fondue was sooo good which came with chocolate, white chocolate, and caramel dippings. The banana tempura was to die for.\n\ni would recommend this place for the decor, ambience, food and desserts! A great date place!"

It was very good without being overly sweet.  For dinner he ordered the Brenner burger, and I had the vegetarian burger.  That was, without a doubt, the best veggie burger I've ever had.  He really liked his as well. The service was nice and efficient.\n\nFor desert we ordered the waffles, chocolate, and banana dish.  Absolutely worth getting.  We almost had to lick the plate clean it was so tasty.  I highly recommend this restaurant for outstanding food and a fabulous experience with chocolate."

The panini was just OK, but the fries were one of the best I've had.  The chili mayo dip for the fries were the perfect accompaniment.  The hazelnut cream chocolate milkshake was really delicious as well, and I love the cool ceramic cup and metal straw it was served in!  Will definitely be back to try the different desserts!"

            "review": "My favorite Max Brenner store is the one in Union Square in New York City, so when I heard that chocolate from the bald man was opened in Las Vegas inside the Forum Shops, I knew I had to make a stop here, just like I did when Serendipity 3 opened. Kind of like my Las Vegas Serendipity experience, I couldn't help but think that both my experiences were better in New York.\n\nThe store inside Caesar's Palace is a smaller low-key store. My friends and I stopped in for some lunch and once again taste that amazing hot chocolate. I ordered the Chubby Smoked Turkey Club that came with waffle fries that were dusted with chili and cocoa powder, my boyfriend ordered the Buffalo Chicken Slider appetizer and Oven Roasted Tomato Pizza, and his friend ordered the Max's Sunday Mood Pasta.\n\nIt might have been that we were starving, but the service seemed to be seriously lagging and there weren't even a lot of people in the restaurant. The food did taste great however, and we ended up getting the hot dark chocolate with marshmallows to go because we were in a hurry to get back to our hotel. But I definitely recommend sitting down and enjoying it from a hug mug.\n\nI also thought Max Brenner's restaurants to be more of a chocolate experience, and I had never had a meal from Max Brenner and have always gone for chocolate and other desserts. Maybe if we had come just to buy a box of truffles and drink hot chocolate and order a fondue it would have been a lot more enjoying instead of coming in for a quick lunch and taken a hot chocolate to go. Either way, I was a little disappointed with the service here compared to my experience in New York. I may or may not come back to Max Brenner inside the Forum Shops, it would all depend on how much I want their hot chocolate."

A highlight of their burger is actually the side dish of waffle cut fries sprinkled with cocoa and chili powder. YUM! Of course I saved room for dessert as this is what Max Brenner is really known for, their delicious chocolate! \n\nI inhaled the banana split waffle. It was divine! Waffle, banana, vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, what more could you want?! This dish easily could  be shared for two. \n\nThe one thing I was sorely disappointed with was their wait staff. My waiter would come and ask me if I needed something- a refill on my drink, dessert, a box, the bill,... then he would either get backed up or forget about me. His saving grace was the manager on shift. She was very attentive and made sure that all my needs were taken care of, I appreciated that though would have liked some consistency with my waiter. I really wanted to leave the tip for the wonderful woman helping me rather than the waiter who took my order. \n\nI very rarely eat much in Vegas, I am glad I tried this place and would recommend this place for their dessert, though their food is good, dessert is truly their specialty."

Make sure to sit at the bar area for happy hour!\n\nI would have to try their other chocolate stuff to give them a fair verdict. For now, max Brenner gets 4 stars."
