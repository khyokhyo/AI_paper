Definately up there on my list of best sushi I have eaten (RM Seafood tops that list). Had some fried rice as well which was pretty good (could have been better) but thats ok it was fair priced and the sushi made up for it. Looking forward to my next visit here."

Naked Fish would be one of my absolute to go places once I visit. \n\nBut yeah, let's talk about the food! One of my absolute favorite foods EVER is their miso glazed sea bass. It's pricey, so so worth it. The fish just melts in your mouth and the miso butter sauce is perfect with it. Their sushi rolls are great and super fresh. I also loved the soft shell crab salad. Finally, their tempura ice cream is a perfect ending to an awesome meal there. Also, the staff are really friendly and helpful!\n\nWhen I finally visit Vegas, I'll be stuffing my mouth with their awesome food and IT WILL BE WORTH IT."

The service here is always impeccable, even at their busiest. Get here early to sit at the bar as it's always packed and rather small. Their kitchen meals are amazing, I take non-sushi people here and they always have a good time and find something delicious to order. I've been coming here for over 10 years and I've never had a bad experience or a single complaint. They have the freshest fish in town and they spare no expense on the quality of their ingredients. If you want to have a gourmet sushi experience without paying Strip prices, then this is your place. I can't tell you how much I love their fish. I'm drooling right now just thinking about it. Not many tourists know about this place, it's almost all locals. Oh and the cirque kids come and play here too, they're fun! Now I'm just rambling on.. that's how taken I am. Try this place and it will quickly become your favorite as well. Tell Peter and Wanda I said hello.."

The rolls have the perfect ratio of rice to fish, most places put too much rice in the rolls but here it's just right. Be sure to make a reservation otherwise you're in for a wait!"

            "review": "Naked Fish's, you are still my favorite sushi place.  While I'm a bit disappointed that you have remained closed for lunch, I still have yet to be disappointed by your food or service.  This is an update, so make sure to read my original review for the recommendations, which I stand by to this day.\n\nThe live ama ebi (sweet shrimp) is quite an experience if you haven't tried it.  They bring the little guy out and introduce you to him so he can wave good bye, then they bring him out with the tail raw and nigiri style, and the head deep fried.  Sometimes people don't know how to handle that-- you just eat the whole thing.  Trust me.  It's been fried, so it'll be crunchy goodness all the way through.\n\nTheir specials rotate, so just check for what's on the chalk board, or ask your waiter.  They're always more than happy to let you know.\n\nI'm not a big fan of uni, but after taking a friend there, he had apparently been searching for a sushi restaurant that served uni, unsuccessfully, for like the last three years.  NF not only has uni, but you get your choice of regular uni, or special uni which has been cleaned and shipped from Japan in salt water to preserve its freshness.  Wanda recommended not to add anymore soy sauce as it would already be salty because of that.  Buddy looked like he had died and gone to heaven."

Sashimi was cut so small and thin, it was almost like eating leftover pieces.  Not worth the money, and we were looking forward to it because of the waitress' comments.  The agadashi tofu was good, as was the seaweed salad.  Roppongi roll was good as was the pork belly and risotto, although some of the pork belly was kind of tough to chew....so overall, good, but not great for the money.  Would I go back?  Maybe, but the sister restaurant, Kyara, off 215 and Jones is my favorite and beats Naked Fish's by a mile."

You have the option of ordering 7 or 14 pieces of sashimi (it's $25 for the 14 pieces).  I thought the price was fair.  It came with miso soup and rice.  I thought the fish was pretty fresh, for Vegas at least.  I rather have this than AYCE here in Vegas.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered just philly rolls, and he really like them.  He compared it to the philly rolls from an AYCE place we went to the following day, and prefers this one a lot more.  It's smaller in size, which I think sushi should be (bite size) and much fresher in quality.\n\nI've been to this place before when it first opened, but I don't really remember much of it.  Hope to give it another try later on."

            "review": "I really hate even posting this, because I know once a place like this gets too popular, the opportunity will exist for the quality of the place to go down.\n\nThat said, for Vegas, the prices here were quite reasonable. If a place like this were on the Strip at the same prices, this place would be ridiculously busy every night.\n\nMe and my two friends went to this place on Saturday night. I had called an hour ahead for a quick reservation and actually got it, which surprised me. The staff was extremely courteous and the rolls were some of the best I've ever had. \n\nI got two of the expensive rolls, the Ultimate Naked ($15)and the Happy Ending ($12.50). That's probably as high-end as it will get in terms of the price range. The soft-shell crab on the Ultimate Naked was ridiculously good and the tuna from the Happy Ending was fresh and had more than enough flavor. The meal ran a shade over $30 but it was worth it. Will definitely come back here the next time I go to Vegas.\n\n9/24/09 addendum: The Kamikaze roll, at $7, is MASSIVELY underrated. The Tiger & Dragon roll was also legit...love me some eel. And if you ever get the opportunity to try the Toro...DO IT."

            "review": "Its always good to have a small, fun local sushi joint...the kind of place you can meet a friend for dinner without going broke or take a date and still impress.  I've eaten at other Sushi places here in Vegas that were either so-so, too expensive or in a casino which always exhausts me, but I finally stumbled onto a place that fits the bill.  Naked Fish was charming, reasonable and delicious...definitely staking a claim to be in my stable of regular eateries.  I also love that their sushi chefs were Japanese.  Not saying that other ethnicities cant make great sushi, but its just one of those things that makes sense to me.  \n\nSituated in a non-descript strip mall on the westside of town, Naked Fish is a small restaurant that has an even tinier sushi bar (5 seats I think) but what it lacks in size it makes up for in ambition.  The menu has a nice selection of appetizers, sushi, sashimi, rolls and grilled entrees.  On my visit, we did a smorgasbord of rolls and sashimi that was fantastic.  The comment that immediately came to mind for all those in my party was the freshness of the fish.  The taste and quality of a fresh product cant be duplicated and so many sushi places trot out marginal seafood that you can tell isnt as fresh as probably advertised.  The amazing freshness of the fish was especially evident in the sashimi where it cant hide behind rice and other accoutrement like in rolls.  We did their Omakase sashimi option which for a set price puts your faith in the sushi chefs and they send out a nice platter based on their whims that evening.  For three people it was $50 and there was everything from Bluefin, to Jackfish to tempura style prawns.   It was enough for all of us to feel full, especially after starting off with an order or Spider rolls and California rolls which were phenomenal...but it was that cool Sushi type full where you dont feel like you need to put on sweat pants in wallow in your filth, like when you have too much pizza.  \n\nService for the evening was credible and friendly and they took the time to explain everything that was sent out to us which is always a big help, especially when dining with sushi novices.  On a side note, its kind of interesting, but the restaurant actually has some great views of Las Vegas.  I know what you're thinking; How can that be in a strip mall?  Well because the parcel across the street is undeveloped, it allows for an unhindered view of the Vegas strip about 6 miles away...especially pretty when the sun is setting.  Remember that you future prince charmings when you need to impress a girl!  Also, they have a food happy hour until 6pm I believe that gives discounts on a number of rolls and appetizers.  \n\nI always knew I prefer things \"Naked\"....."

I rarely go during regular dinner hours, it's mostly a late night place for me although I have eaten here for lunch and dinner in the past. The late night specials start at 10pm and include a selection of rolls, some sushi, and sake specials. I usually sit at the sushi bar and the staff has always been very friendly and willing to help with anything I have questions about.\n\nIf you like fish (of course you do, if you're thinking about going here) they do a really nice hamachi collar appetizer. It's not the most glamours cut of the fish, being basically the neck section, but the meat is juicy and delicious even though it takes a little work to get it out of the bone structure. Trust me, it's worth a try.\n\nThe prices are affordable and the quality is top notch and they're open until 2AM. Love it!"

            "review": "This is far off the strip where most likely you will only find locals this will be quite a long cab ride so keep this in mind with your budget if you are a traveler.  They do the take out orders for the Cirque Du Soleil shows in Vegas and a lot of the local poker players eat here as well I thought that was kind of cool. \n\n You walk into a small, quite, subtly lit place that had a nice view of the strip from high up in the valley looking down on the night lights.  We open the menu to find they have Uni shipped in a way to have it maintain its freshness and flavor an amazing and wonderful feat in my eyes.  BTW I was impressed on this day of the freshness of the Uni and my BF was in love of it!  They also have live shrimp (Amaebi ) the heads can be prepared two different ways fried or into a soup, both are on my favorite list.  They have quite a selection of rolls some cooked some raw with special sauces on them.  They also have a nice selection of fresh good quality sushi and sashimi they offer fresh Wasabi for a small fee.  We ordered a few cooked items as well for our friend all of which were as good as the rest of the choices we made!  I recommend Hamachi Kama (collar).  A part of the fish sadly miss by most Americans but moist, juicy and cooked to perfection.  Another nice surprise was the braised pork belly with a honey mustard sauce.  My absolute favorite cooked food of the night is their Miso glazed sea bass Wow is all I can say but I am a kind of miso fish lover so I might be bias. \n\n They also have a late night happy hour from 10PM to 2AM if you're in the mood for a late diner or snack.  Sadly I live quite a distance from here but I will be back even with the half hour drive"

To begin, the atmosphere is comfortable, very welcoming and just delightful. If you are so lucky to be served on by Wanda, you came up - and you should feel grateful. There is not a chance you would ever be served something that wasn't fresh. The quality of their fish is better than any I've had, ever - and I know myself and my family to be a sushi snobs 100%.\n\nWhen my family goes to NF's, we don't even place an order - which is unusual for a group of food-obsessed individuals - but rather, Wanda does everything. She definitely knows what we like, but will always bring out whatever is the freshest and any fun specials. Another special thing about this place is that they serve chawanmushi! And it's fantastic and delicious every single time. They will make whatever type of roll you want to complete your experience - I believe my Dad combined two of them and now that's one of our staples. However, the rolls are inventive and truly on point, you don't need to get creative, the sushi chefs take care of that.\n\nMost recently, Naked Fish's was kind enough to cater a special dinner at our home and words cannot express how special and tasty everything was. They literally brought the restaurant to our house, complete with a giant sushi boat they constructed. Everything was on point per usual and that will go down in history as one of the best nights of my life. We had about 20 people and every single one - even those who don't eat fish - couldn't stop singing NF's praises.\n\nPeople should understand that not only are you getting extremely good quality eats when you're dining at NF, but also, you're undoubtedly partaking in a wonderful experience because their staff is truly spectacular. Clearly, the chefs and cooks know what they are doing. Yet anyone from the hostess, to Wanda (and other servers), to the owner of the restaurant are truly wonderful people who want you to enjoy the gift they are bestowing upon you. \n\nDo yourself a favor and get over to Naked Fish's! It almost pains me to share this with the public because I want to keep that place for myself- but they deserve all the praise!"

I've read the good and the bad reviews and I was hesitant to try..but it was late and there was really no other option near us.\n \nI was quite surprised of the location and how tiny the place was. I read alot about how this place was the best ever, as well as how terrible it was because people thought there was a lack of fish in their rolls.\n\nWe got a couple of specials on the board. First the amberjack sashimi otherwise known as the freaking delicious Kampachi. Love love this fish and missed it so much haven't seen it since I lived in Hawaii, bomb for sure, nice and buttery! Second I saw that they had Kumamoto oysters, and I am such an oyster lover and as most lovers know, not alot of off the strip places have quality oysters like that, so I had to get them. Preferably I like my oyster plain so I can control whats on them, they had some sort of a ponzu ginger sauce on them with scallions which was fine, and yes the oyster met my standards. we also got hamachi sashimi which was plump and delicious also, as well as the hamachi collar and the happiness roll. The roll was pretty good but not at all the best I've had, there was a little more seaweed salad in the roll than the Ahi that comes with it, but the little crunch of the garlic sitting on top kinda made the roll for me, it dispersed just the right amount of garlic for that roll. In conclusion my overall experience for food was exceptional for the price your paying and the quality and service you got, and btw the service was awesome(we sat ot the sushi bar w Peter). A large kirin split, a large carafe of chilled sake, kanpachi and hamachi sashimi, happiness roll, kumamoto oysters, hamachi collar, strawberry and green tea mochi ice cream, and $135 later($98 for bill, $17 for server, $10 for sushi chefs), it was a well worth dining experience and I would go back in a heart beat!"

Most of them know our orders before we even make it and this is even after not eating there for 1-2 months.\n\nThe sushi here is always fresh and the rolls are creative and delicious. I used to have a problem with the way their sashimi was priced but they have since fixed that. If you are looking for cheap sushi you should definitely try their lunch specials where you can have 3 rolls for under $20 and this includes most of their most expensive rolls. They just included a lunch special where you get 21 pieces of sashimi for $21. Holy Sushi Coma!"

We experimented with the sashimi (uni and giant clam -- neither of which were all that spectacular or fresh), the sushi (the Japanese Lasagna was pretty good... but I was not as thrilled with the 911, Dejavu or the Kamikaze), and the hot food (the NZ Mussels are FABULOUS.... but their tempura chef's special left much to be desired.... it was SEEPING in oil.  I'm gagging just thinking about it...).  Their sake list was nice, as was the decor and the comp dessert we got when they found out we were celebrating my man's b-day in advance.  For slightly more $$, I would head to Sen (see my previous reviews) down the street for a much better meal."

            "review": "I am writing this review with the following in mind: last year, I went to this restaurant five times and all five times were absolutely outstanding. We went last night and it was not outstanding but just OK.\nTo begin with, I found it a little odd that it was very easy to get reservations on a Saturday night where it is usually difficult to do that. Still, the seaweed salad was delicious as was the vegetable tempura. We ordered sashimi salmon with lemon and ponzu sauce and it was just OK. I kept being told how tasty it would be but it fell a little flat to me and it was missing acidity. My favorite roll is yellowtail with scallion. I ordered that and I was very disappointed because it was 'mashed' yellowtail with scallion through it and it must have been salted 'or something' because the actual role was very salty without any soy sauce on it. Not good! I explained that what it is is a piece of yellow tail with a little bit scallion on top rolled. Any sushi chef knows exactly what you're talking about so I am not sure what they understood but I clearly said a yellowtail with scallion roll and what I got was not all that appetizing.\nMy friend got the shrimp tempura roll which did look good and was good. She also got the Philly roll which  she likes and I do not care for but she said it was good. She also got a California roll that she said was good. Overall, it only gets three stars from me and is only average for me. I would not rush to go back with the experience I had last night. I am disappointed."

You can't take down people's reviews because you don't like what we think of your restaurant.\n\nFEB 2010\nAfter reading numerous great reviews for this sushi bar, my fiance and I came here, ready to stuff ourselves with sushi. Worst decision EVER!!!\n\nThe sushi was ok and the rolls were disgusting. The spicy tuna roll tasted like it had been pre-made and sitting in the fridge all day. The few rolls we tried that could pass as just average sushi hardly had any fish. They were mostly rice and vegetables. We kept trying different rolls hoping that it would be amazing like all the reviews had stated but we were so, so wrong. We left with a $100 bill and still hungry.\n\nWhoever wrote that this place was a top restaurant obviously does not know what good food tastes like. We love Sushi Fever, but like others have written it is a little over-priced which is why we chose Naked Fish. We were shocked that we spent more money than we've ever spent at Sushi Fever for gross, grocery store quality sushi."

Now to the food, I was with a party of 6 so we tried a few different items. The soft shell crab salad was good with a pretty big portion. The scallops were not very fresh, and not good. It didn't have a crunchy texture to it. They grated some lemon on it probably to mask the unfreshness of the fish. The poki salad had a good flavor but the tuna was not very good.

My friend from Las Vegas brought me here last year.. every time I visit Vegas to check on my house which I just bought and is close by, I am sure to pay NAKED FISH a visit. The last couple of times I've been here I ordered the Japanese Lasagna roll--- which my friend's and I call \"the cheeseburger roll\".

I have been to Kobe Sushi and Oyshi Sushi. Basically you pay $25+ for really crappy sushi. And by crappy I mean sushi that is not fresh and is drenched in different kind of sauces to hide the fact that it is not fresh. I was in Vegas a week ago and I had a Eureka moment. I realized that if you go to a non-buffet sushi place, the cost will come out to be the same or cheaper than at a buffet. \n\nTo test my assumption, my friend and I went to Naked Fish. We came here around noon time and it was really crowded. We were both super hungry and wanted to order everything on the menu. We ended up getting the lunch time special. We ordered a 3 roll combo ($19.95) and it comes with miso soup and salad. The miso soup and salad were ok, but the rolls were A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.! I was really surprised at how fresh the sushi were. We ordered the scallop roll, Kamikaze, and Dark Circle Roll. \n\n1. Scallop Roll (6pc)\nThis was a really traditional roll with just scallops. Normally, I would never get scallops at a sushi restaurant because it is usually not fresh enough for me. The scallops at sushi restaurants are usually drenched in some kind of sauce to mask the lack of freshness. However, I was really impressed with the scallops here. This roll was very simple and fresh. Perfecto!\n\n2. Kamikaze (8pc)\nThis was one of their specialty roll. It has fresh water eel, advocado, spicy tuna, served with eel sauce). Both my friend and I loved this too!\n\n3. Dark Circle (5pc)\nAnother specialty, it has shrimp, kani kama, fresh water eel with spicy tuna, avocado, kizami on top, served with eel sauce. This roll didn't disappoint.\n\nIn addition to the lunch combo, we also ordered their infamous Tuna Tataki Salad ($15.95). This has seared tuna with tataki sauce. This salad was delicious as well! The greens that they used was fresh, tuna was fresh, and so was the avocado! \n\nOur total meal was about $38 for two people! Score!!\n\nNext time, I really want to try the chef omakase sashimi. It is only $15 per person!!\n\nNote: the lunch time combo has different combos to pick from. For #1 combo, you get to pick 1 out of 12 rolls. For #2 combo, you get to pick 2 out 22 rolls. For #3 combo, you get to pick 3 out of 37 rolls. Rolls range from traditional Japanese to specialty.\n\nXtra Note: during the weekday, they are open for lunch/dinner. weekends are dinner only."

So overpriced and overhyped for what you get. *see pics* \n\nthe roppangi roll is drenched in sauce, the flavor is decent, but Naked Fish's rolls are the tiny sized rolls with unremarkable bits of fish on top, so even if the fish was fresh I couldn't tell. \n\nI don't understand what the hype is about the Salmon appetizer. It was thin pieces of salmon, drenched with lemon, maybe radish and a type of fish egg/masago thing. The extreme lemon totally obscured the flavor of the salmon, and the cuts were so thin that I couldn't even tell if the fish was fresh.  Salmon is pretty hard to screw up regardless. \n\nTo top that the service was pretty slow, and  me and my roommates rolls kept coming out at separate times so we would never be eating at the same time. \n\nOh, and the Mochi ice cream was Bad.  $4 for two pieces of mochi and the mochi on the outside was thin and hard (not soft and chewy like gelatinous mochi rice should be) \n\nEven with the free sake pineapple shirly temple w yelp check in....

They are open late which is good for late night sushi.  The staff is attentive and friendly and its always full but we've never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a table.  \n\nI'm still not sure about the decor since there are giant posters of Cirque du Soleil shows framed on the walls all signed by the cast.  I'm not sure if a Cirque employee owns the place or the owner just really loves Cirque.  Nonetheless, Naked Fish is also a good place to spot entertainers looking for a good healthy meal after work.  I've mainly spotted Cirque performers or dancers from Crazy Horse Paris there.  \n\nOne more added gem to the place.  If you are lucky enough to get a booth by the window, you get an unobstructed view of the Las Vegas Strip since there is nothing across the street but a big dirt lot.  Really pretty at night when the Strip is all lit up.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Naked Fish to anyone."

We had an order for appetizer then an order for dessert!\n\nTAKO WASABI $4 - the amount that they give you for this dish is RIDICULOUS!! We couldn't taste too much wasabi but we found out it's because they ran out of fresh pickled wasabi =[ but still good.\n\nSHIGOKU OYSTER $7 - tiny little oysters that we're so cute & gone in less than a second. 2 pieces per order.\n\nROCK & ROLL #1 $15 - a no rice roll that our server chose for us... ahhaha we have had this roll in many different places so we weren't too impressed... but her enthusiasm for her choice was cute. Thinly sliced cucumber wrapped around Tuna, Salmon, Crab Stick, Yellow Tail, & Sprouts.\n\nORGANIC MISO SOUP $3 - it was just miso soup... probably won't order it again for 3 bux\n\nHH GREEN BEAN TEMPURA $4 - you get a GOOD amount of green beans... definitely could have been a little more CRISPIER.\n\nGREEN TEA CREME BRULEE $7 - DERICIOUS you could definitely taste the green tea & it is served w/ a strawberry sherbert w/ whip cream. My photo really does no justice \n\nMOCHI ICE CREAM $4 - I dunno why we ordered mochi... ahahaa you could get a whole box at the market.\n\nMAN'S MOUNTAIN JUNAMI SAKE $12.50 - rich & dry at the same time... came in a cute little craft w/ ice filled in the whole to keep it chilled. \n\nDEFINITELY will be back to try more items ESPECIALLY HH stuff!!"

Fairly intimate location, not what I would call small, because it doesn't feel small, just more like cozy. Service is very good, willing to help you out or suggest things to try. They do have specials as well, but we didn't try them out. We opted for a couple of different rolls, plus this Lobster tempura salad thing with this amazingly flavorful and spicy dressing. It was fantastic, although the mouth numbness took over after a while, but damn it was so full of flavor, and the lobster was super fresh and tender. Prices are very reasonable and the fish was very fresh tasting. They also have a very small bar in the back, room for 5 people or so. Very nice experience, would definitely go back."

I just feel they are competing with so many sushi places out there and I'd hate to see them go down for high prices. I have to spend way more money to get full than other great sushi places out there. I hate to complain about prices though. This place is still amazing with quality food"

It was hyped by him, to say the least, and we were celebrating so we decided to go all out. Here's what we got and my review of each:\n\n1. House Sake: $3 happy hour sake? Yes. Please. I know next to nothing about sake but it tasted good to me and was served warm.\n\n2. Jalapeno Yellowtail: delightful appetizer, very spicy and flavorful. The sauce the yellowtail floats in is very good.\n\n3. Fosizzle My Nizzle: basically a Japanese jalapeno popper. Absolutely delightful. I highly recommend this one.\n\n4. Zero Tiger: the most simple roll we got with tempura shrimp, avocado, and spicy mayo. Their spicy mayo is amazing.\n\n5. GTR: My second favorite roll we got. This one has been hit with a blow torch for a charred taste. Spicy, savory, amazing. Highly recommend.\n\n6. Miso Sea Bass: favorite dish of the night. Hands down the best fish I've had in my life. Run, don't walk, to this amazing dish. You won't regret it.\n\n7. Roppongi: my boyfriend originally had this on his list and then forgot when he ordered. The waitress recommended it at the end and he realized that was what he forgot. My favorite roll of the night, plus you can take a moment from your fine dining experience to giggle at the consistency and color of the sauce on it (you'll see).\n\n8. Green Tea Mochi: what's better than delicious matcha ice cream and mochi at the end of your meal? Nothing. That's what.\n\nAll of this came out to less than $80 for 2 people to absolutely feast on a 7-dish meal plus sake. Service was impeccable. Atmosphere is super casual and pleasant. Check out the signatures and remnants of celebrities and Vegas performers. Plus, get a window seat and you have an amazing panoramic view of the strip!"

I have gotten to know the sushi chefs there, so when I asked them what happened, they told me that it was because they received a shipment of sub-par tuna that day.  Since so many customers order tuna on any given day (rolls, spicy tuna, etc), they decided it was best to just close for the day rather than try and salvage some of the bad tuna.\n\nThat is the definition of integrity.  I don't know any other sushi restaurant in town that would sacrifice a day of revenue because of a situation like that.  Definitely not Sushi-Mon or any of the Korean run sushi restaurants in town - no way.  \n\nI think that speaks highly of the owner and the importance he puts on consistently serving only the highest quality fish.\n\nOther than that, I don't have much of an update.  I continue to order many of my favs I've written about in the past including GT-R roll, hamachi, aji, ika ten.  Lately, they have also been getting in some really fresh moi from Hawaii.  Also, since my last review I have been served some very good uni - as good as any I've had at other places."

The drive from the Stratosphere out to the restaurant wasn't too bad and we were rewarded with no wait and cheap prices. =) At first, we ordered an app and 2 rolls but, after finishing the second roll, we decided to spring for another one. \n\n+ Naked Crab: Pretty good, if you ask me. We loved that it was fried (not like your typical spring roll) and they weren't stingy on the portion. \n+ GTR: You can't go wrong with shrimp tempura AND spicy tuna. Each bite was absolutely delicious and full of flavor. \n+ Kamikaze: I'm not a fan of fresh water eel - it's always either too salty or topped with too much sauce, which is exactly the case here. However, the spicy tuna was powerful enough to make up for it. \n+ Deja Vu: So so good. Spicy salmon with salmon on top. PERFECT. Their Naked mayo was also particularly noteworthy. \n\nAfter our experience here, we've considered just going out towards Spring Valley for all of our meals whenever we're in Vegas. =)"

The servers are always polite and professional, always making sure you are satisfied, and happy with your order. The sushi here is yummm! Their signature sushi is their \"Lasagna Roll\" A MUST TRY!

I never leave disappointed. \n\nThe only downside is, if you are here early, (because they open at 5pm..) if it were 4:55 p.m. they still wouldn't let you come in, or at least wait inside the restaurant. I think they should seat their guests regardless, for better service. It can get busy too, that from time to time you have to remind your server what you need...but all in all, I give this place 4/5..it's even better if you have a window seat, you can see a view of the strip.

The wait was estimated at 5 minutes for the sushi bar, in reality it was actually longer, but I thought it was worth it.\n\nLobster Roll is the feature HH roll of the week, so I gave that a try, along with Tiger Roll, 911 Roll, and Garlic JP Lasagna Roll.  The Lobster Roll was a little disappointing for me, as what I had imagined from reading the description and the actual roll that was served was not the same. I was thinking fresh lobster, but all the lobster are tempura fried.  The Tiger Roll and 911 Roll are my two favorite, and if I really have to be picky, I would say that the chefs may go a little crazy saucing the plate with eel sauce.  The Garlic JP Lasagna Roll was good, and was not served drowning in broiled mayo like at some lesser sushi restaurants in town.\n\nService was good, and I didn't have to ask for refills in spite of how busy the restaurant was.\n\nAnyway, Naked Fish is recommended overall as a restaurant.  As far as their HH menu, it is basically $2 off their selection of rolls, so if you want nigiri as part of the HH discount, there are other places to try if that is a deal breaker."

The wife and I were looking for a sushi dinner on last minutes notice after work and wanted to try something close to the house.  I found Naked Fish's here on Yelp and decided to give it a try... glad we did!\n\nThe restaurant was easy to find with ample parking for 5:50pm on a Friday night.  We parked right in front of the door and walked in, greeted by the smiling staff :)  We were escorted to a booth and again greeted by the sushi bar guys as with any friendly sushi spot.\n\nFrom that point forward everything fell right into place to make for a great experience. Our server was attentive to all of our needs from the 1st to the last minute.  We ordered our Kirin's and just caught the happy hour special, so ordered the Shrimp Tempura Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll & Spider Roll.  We got our beer a few minutes later then followed right after with our food.  It was awesome!  As we sat there, more people started to come in and fill up the seats.  We had perfect timing, but even still we noticed that everyone was being served quickly & attentively.  \n\nAs for the food, tasted fresh & quite delicious for being Happy Hour rolls. We noticed that even the tempura was cooked well as it wasn't soggy or soft. It was still warm and crispy :)  Only thing I'd say against the rolls is that the Spicy Tuna wasn't as spicy as I would have liked and the wasabi was not that spicy either. Kind of weird, but still really good.\n\nAfter we finished that, we ordered the special Premium Toro w/ fresh wasabi & Salmon nigiri.  WOW.  The Toro was so soft and juicy.  It was a thick cut as well, definitely a great choice as our server had indicated they had just got it, so it was fresh!\n\nAll in all, we couldn't find a fault outside of not being able to fit any more in our belly.  We'll definitely be back for the Roppongi and a few other of the nigiri choices. Highly recommend this for sushi cravings."

We got there at 10PM (when Happy Hour starts). We order a bunch of different apps that were so reasonably priced. I'll admit, I was nervous with the prices, but Naked Fish, you did not disappoint.\n\nThere are several rolls on their Happy Hour menu, some as cheap as $3! Re-DONK-ulous and the most expensive is around $7. Not. Shabby. At. All. \n\nThe restuarant is small, dimly lit, and intimate. (Last I checked there was a breif close for remodeling)\n\nThe sushi chefs are willing to accomidate any request. I've even created rolls all of my own and they have accomidated.\n\nThe green tea isn't that great, they use matcha powder, similar to what we used for green tea frappuccinos at Starbucks.\n\nThis place hits the spot after a night of drinking and dancing. They are open until 2 AM. And they are just as friendly and accomidating to guests at 1 AM as they are at 7 PM.\n\nAll in all, Naked Fish, is the business. Definitely check it out if you are in the neighborhood. It's yum to the yum yum yummy!"

            "review": "Naked Fish has the BEST quality sushi!\n\nNow before I go on and give my review of this restaurant, let me tell you that I've been to a lot of expensive restaurants.. where having good quality fish is a must. I've been to Yellowtail at the Bellagio, I've been to Nobu at the Hard Rock, and I've even been to Morimoto's in New York. After spending hundreds of dollars at all these other restaurants, I must say.. I would have rather gone to Naked Fish for sushi.\\\n\nWhen:\nThe first time I came here, I was with my boyfriend and his brother (who was visiting Las Vegas from Orlando). My boyfriend plays poker for a living, and this restaurant came up in conversation many times when he would be playing.. so we just had to give this place a try. We came here on a Sunday night around 10pm.\n\nWhere: \nThis place is a little far from the strip and from where I live (Henderson); however, it's well worth the drive. When walking in; the restaurant  was smaller than what I was imagining. The place was a little busy, and we had to wait 5 minutes to be seated. We were seated in one of the booths near the windows.. from our table you could see the entire strip. The view was beautiful.\n\nWho:\nService here is just okay in my opinion. It may have been the fact that we were all super hungry, but it seemed as though it took FOREVER to get our food. However, the 2nd time I've been here.. the wait wasn't that long. There were also times when we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled. \n\nWhat:\nYuzu Salmon (Appetizer): This is definitely a MUST whenever I go here. The salmon is soooo tender and just melts in your mouth; and the flavor compliments the fish just sooooo well. I urge anyone to give this a try.. I give you my word that you will not be disappointed.\n\nYellowtail, Albacore, & Red Snapper Nigiri: I just LOVE these.. they are all so fresh and tender.. I LOVE LOVE LOVE these.\n\nSpicy Tuna Roll: We ordered this because they serve it on the Happy Hour menu.. this is definitely the best spicy tuna I've had. The texture of the spicy tuna is just right, and it's not TOO spicy. \n\nPrice:\nAs I mentioned earlier, the prices for their sushi is only a fraction of what you would pay at a fine dining restaurant. For 3 people, we paid around 70 dollars for everything. Yes, some may consider that expensive given the fact that everything is a la carte and not an AYCE place.. However; the quality of fish is on par with any fine dining sushi place. You will NOT find this quality of fish anywhere that serves AYCE sushi. This place serves high quality fish for just a fraction of the price. Yes, most people would prefer an AYCE place and get the most for their money.. However, I prefer quality over quantity\n\nWhy... I would definitely be back.\nNaked Fish's quality is top notch.. and I'm also glad they are open late everyday (2am).. it's soooo hard to satisfy my sushi cravings late at night. But now I've found the perfect place. Anytime I want sushi, this is my go to place."

There wasn't much of a selection but the prices were very inexpensive, about $4 for each roll. We ordered the 911 roll (definitely a must-try), my all time favorite the Japanese Lasagna, the Naked Girls roll, the Philadelphia roll, the Haley roll, and their weekly special the Sunset Roll. Every single roll was tasty, no disappointment whatsoever. \n\nAs for the drinks on the happy hour menu, they only offered beer, sake, and wine. I'm guessing they didn't have a full bar. Off the happy hour menu, I ordered some sort of sake cocktail called the Pineapple Shirley Temple, at about $4 as well. Very delicious, I'd definitely recommend!\n\nI gave Naked Sushi 4 stars since the service was a little slow. We waited a while to order, to finally get the food, and even when we had to pay. I hope this place doesn't get too busy, I don't know how they'd be able to handle that.\n\nOverall, a great place! The restaurant itself was very inviting and nicely decorated although a bit small. Hopefully they expand the happy hour menu. I'd definitely be visiting again."

I don't know why so many people rave about this place it's probably because a lot of well known poker players eat here but who really cares about that? The portions are SO SMALL and I'm a small girl only 93 pounds at 5'2 so if I say the portions are small then you know there is something wrong. The sushi is overpriced especially because even though the fish is fresh I've had fresher sushi at other places at a better price. The waitresses were horrible and there were 3 of them standing there doing nothing. They even forgot one of our orders so we just canceled it which was probably a good idea since the sushi wasn't really worth waiting for or for the price. The happy hour isn't anything special and isn't worth a trip there just for that. I think this place is so overrated!\n\nBTW after we left Naked Fish we actually went to Wendy's after because our hunger was not satisfied. I should have went to Wendy's first and just skipped Naked Fish from the beginning!"

I do not know if this restaurant was such as miss on this evening since the chef was at the LVvino event and they took all of their fresh fish to that event but this was as disappointing as it gets. We were seriously concerned whether we were going to get sick that night. I have eaten Sushi all over the World so I believe that should qualify me as a Sushi connoisseur and this restaurant was a definite miss on this evening...took me back to the old days when only a fool would try fish in the desert but this has changed with shipping and new food handling capabilities.

On the advice of our cute waitress, Sayo, said they were just flown in, tried two new-to-me nigiris and LOVED EM: Spanish Mackerel (was not salty or fishy AT ALL like mackerel I've had b4), and Striped Jack (awesome, smooth, melts in your mouth)!\nThe only reason I did not give it a 5 stars was the fish portions and rolls were a little on the small side, and nobody was really naked! Well, only the fish. Still, I would come again 4 sure!"

Also, they have the best cucumber salad I've ever had at a sushi restaurant. The food came out really quickly and the servers are really prompt with refills. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the space. For such a popular restaurant, it's pretty small! Which I usually don't mind, but when you sit at the sushi bar, all the waiters surround you due to their computer's location. It's no deal breaker or anything- just feels a little too crowded for my liking"

For $21 you get three sushi rolls and a beer! You can't beat this at any other sushi spot. Of course they only serve Japanese beers, so they are on the weaker side but still tasty for what they are. Now I'm not a fan of baked rolls, but the Japanese Lasagna Roll is out of bounds! So much flavor and not over cooked. If baked rolls aren't your thing then definitely try the Roppongi Roll. The presentation is damn near artistic and the harmony of flavors are euphoric. Happy hour starts at 10pm, but for Vegas that's just the start of the night."

We arrived early enough for a few happy hour specials (happy hour M-Th is 2-6pm, I believe.  I know for sure it ends at 6, at least.)- so we ordered 3 carafes of sake for $4.50 each along with some discounted rolls.  Good deal!  Our waitress then brought out the huge magnums of sake along with the carafes and separate glasses for each type of sake.  They take their sake seriously here!  Apparently, they also take their soy sauce seriously since our waitress made a point to tell us that it was house made.\n\nWe also ordered omekase sashimi B, our sweet waitress asked us if we also wanted the miso soup and maybe some rice with that?  I have NEVER been asked in a sushi restaurant if I wanted rice along with my sashimi and have always had to ask for it.  But not here, it was offered.  Man, my husband and I were so impressed.  \n\nTo top it all off, maybe it was because we caught the tail end of happy hour, but the entire over-the-top meal of 3 carafes of sake, 3 rolls, and an omekase platter, came out to less than $100 bucks.  This place has been permanently bookmarked in this household as our go-to sushi place in Las Vegas now."

I was a little bummed it wasn't all you can eat, even tho the dealer who recommended it told me it was. \n\n2. Okay everything is alcarte so I was expecting amazing fresh quality fish, was not impressed. Had a ropangi roll recommended by the waitress, the fish was a little fishy for tuna even tho it was masked by ton of vinaigrette sauce. \n\n3. tried the banzai roll that was deep fried boy was that a mistake, fillet o-fish  would have tasted better.\n\n4. Had an eel roll, spicy scallop (way to sweet they put a sweet spicy sauce not in a good way) and a shrimp tempura roll, the eel and shrimp tempura roll was ehh nothing outstanding. \n\n5. had a gyoza on the side cant go wrong with some fried dumplings, I think that was the best thing I had.\n\n\nI didn't try any nigiri because I would have ended spending over $100 if I did by myself. Now I had 5 rolls that was basic and was on the cheaper side and happy hour prices. I couldn't believe my bill was $70 after tip for myself.\n\nI don't mind paying for good food but it was mediocre for what I payed.\nMaybe I'm missing something because this place has 4 stars on yelp. I was very disappointed by their roll selection everything included imitation crab meat which is junk. For the price I payed they should use real crab meat. \n\nI would have only payed $30 bucks for an all you can eat sushi bar in Vegas and the quality is better. Like goyemon or sin city sushi. I felt raped after paying $70 for crappy rolls. If the rolls and fish was much better quality no problem but it was crap or mediocre. \n\nplus as a added bonus I got food poisoning what a great gift getting to go to the bathroom several times\n\nHonestly I don't know why this place is so highly rated by yelpers, food was mediocre."

I like Naked Fish for the fresh variety of interesting seafare, and it's somewhat lower prices.  \n\nThe menu is always changing to reflect what is fresh.  This is what separates Naked Fish from many other sushi restaurants.  In addition to the higher quality and fresh variety, the prices aren't as high as you would find at a few other notable sushi places in the valley.  \n\nHere's my order:\n\nShigoku Oysters -  Two fresh japanese oysters, served with some garlic, scallions, and soy sauce (I believe).  The oysters were a bit more firm than ones you would find from the east coast, but a nice mild flavor.  I thought some of the flavors the oyster was served with came off muddled, I would have rather tasted the oyster au natural.\n\nRounin Aji -  This Japanese Sea Bass was delicate and delicious.  It had a fuller flavor of the ocean than some other sea bass I've had, and was quite nice.\n\nSashimi A Combo -  Tuna, Salmon, Hamachi.  Nice presentation, but the sashimi was sliced a bit thick for my preference.  I think thinner cuts would also aid in the presentation.  Regardless, the high quality was evident in each piece.\n\nSpicy Tuna Handroll -  Well balanced with reasonable heat.  A very good handrail.\n\nThe rolls on the menu looked good, I would come back and try a few.  They also have some happy hours, check out some of the other great reviews to get info on those."

            "review": "Ok, let me preface this by saying that though this is my first Yelp review, I'm not one of these folks who comes on here just to write one scathing review based on a single bad experience.  I've been reading Yelp reviews for a few years now, and always use it as a foremost authority before hitting up any new Vegas eateries.  My lady and I are also relentless foodies, frequenting restaurants of all genres and price ranges all over town and every time we travel.  I guess what I'm trying to say is...this ain't my first rodeo.\n\nFor comparison's sake, and/or to put my preferences into context, one of my favorite sushi spots is Sushi Mon on Sahara, which I find to be pretty darn good (not amazing, but good people, quick service, and good all-you-can-eat value).  We were a bit keen on trying a new place, and Naked Fish had been recommended to us by a few people.  So of course, I came on Yelp and saw nothing but pristine 4 and 5 star reviews.  Safe to say I was chomping at the bit to get in to Naked Fish and try it out.\n\nAWFUL.  To say I was disappointed would be the understatement of the year.  We dropped $130 and ended up getting Taco Bell on the way home.  The rolls were MINUSCULE.  I suppose that if you're a gringo and your idea of \"sushi\" is rice, seaweed and ginger, this is the place for you.  But where was the fish?  It was almost impossible to differentiate between the different types of fish we were eating because the cuts were so tiny.  We ordered about 7 or 8 different rolls from their limited menu, and afterwards the only thing I was thinking was, \"Damn, these all taste the same.\"  \n\nI say \"limited menu\" because the vast majority of their rolls were some sort of fried or baked varieties.  Those aren't really my preference as it's generally difficult to taste the fish.  But hell, maybe those would've been better than the nonsense we were eating.\n\nThat said, the sushi chefs were nice, though extremely slow, and the sake was delicious.  Unfortunately, I might feel that way because it was the only thing I had to help wash down the tasteless \"sushi\" that I was (reluctantly) ingesting.\n\nI promise to review other places.  I love lots of LV restaurants; this is NOT one of them."

The presentation of their sushi on their plates really adds to your appetite and knowing that you are about to devour some pretty damn good sushi.

Also ordered several rolls: California roll with blue crab instead of imitation crab - way better; lobster roll - yum, rainbow roll - could go easy on the rice; Ropongi roll - must order!\n\nFinished off with green tea ice cream and tempura ice-cream, both were above average.

I think I liked this place in part because our waitress was very helpful and gave us recommendations that were distinct and dead-on for the nigiri and sashimi. We also got some rolls that were well-balanced and crunchy (okay, I couldn't help myself and got one tempura roll- I know some people don't consider those fried rolls real sushi, but damn, they're good!).\n\nLow lighting, lots of locals (or at least people that seemed to know each other really, really well). \n\nI would come back here. We got the house sake warm and it wasn't terrible when it started to become cold (actually, I've never had saki before so I have nothing to compare it to! For shame...)\n\nStill, our bill was around sixty dollars with tip for two sets of fancy rolls, sake, beer, and a plentiful portion of nigiri and sashimi (we tried at least  five or six different kinds of fish). Plus we had edamame. I'm just thinking how much MORE it would have been if we had eaten by the casinos. Damn. \n\nAn all-around enjoyable meal."

The sushi is perfectly good and fresh, and they have some great rolls, though we typically stick more to nigiri and sashimi. The uni and scallop is always very fresh and they almost always have toro.\n\nPros:\n\n*Price. It's not the best sushi you will ever try, but it's good enough, and you pay a lot less here than you will at high-end places on the strip.\n*Open super late! Sometimes we don't get around to calling in an order until 10pm, so it's nice that it's open so late.\n*Huge fish selection\n\nCons:\n*Ambiance is a very typical hole-in-the-wall Japanese place, nothing special (doesn't matter if you get takeout or are just in the mood for something casual)\n*If you dine in, service can be appallingly slow, especially if the restaurant is busy."

Thanks to Yelp and all the great reviews about this place, we got in the car and drove to Naked Fish!\n\nThis place is awesome! It's a pretty small restaurant. We got here around 5pm on a Friday and we were seated right away. By the time we left at 6pm, the place was full and there were a few parties waiting in line for a table.\n\nThey had many sushi dishes to choose from. I liked how they had a full picture menu for the sushi so you can see what it looks like. Then I thought, hey this place is called Naked Fish, so why not try the fish? So I ordered the Salmon Miso Yaki Meal and my husband ordered this Conch dish that our server had told us about - it was the special of the day and supposedly very good. A few minutes later our server came back to me and said that the salmon wasn't available. So she suggested that I get the Grilled Sea Bass Miso Butter Meal instead. I do like Miso Black Cod, and she said it was similar to that. I was kind of hesitant at first. I mean, it was $27.95, and I wasn't planning to order anything expensive. But then I thought, what the hell, I just had a bad week and I'm relaxing in Vegas for the weekend, so why not? Well, she was right, it was great! Good flavor, the fish was easy to eat, and I like how it came with an extra cup of miso on the side. Nice presentation of our two dishes as well, the food looked very pretty!\n\nNot sure what our server's name was. The receipt said Wanda, but the sushi chefs where calling her \"Nikki-san.\" Well, whoever she was, she was great! Very nice and friendly and did a good job checking up on us from time to time even though it was busy. The other servers also stopped by our table to ask how the food was.\n\nI will definitely be back for some sushi, desserts, and more fish! Good location because it's close to home and open until 2am!"

At one point I had tried all the sushi places in town with only Nobu coming close to the quality I was used to. While they have great food, their prices are ridiculous so that was out of the question. \n\nI actually gave up on sushi until I gave in to a friend's recommendation and tried Naked Sushi. They didn't disappoint and while they are still not on the level of L.a. they are close. I love their house rolls and tempura offerings and the freshness of the fish for sashimi is great. \n\nThey could be a bit cheaper but really since they are the only good place in town, I don't mind paying.

            "review": "After spending several hours on-line scoping out sushi spots to celebrate my son's graduation after 9pm on a Tuesday. I picked this spot because it was open late (til 2am), had good reviews and sounded \"family friendly\". I was a bit disappointed.  \n\nThe food was just so-so. I've had better sushi. It was fresh enough but completely unremarkable. There was lots of differently named rolls. But, we ordered two of the spiciest rolls on the menu (marked by 4 & 5 chili icons) and had to add extra wasabi & ginger just to get a little heat. We even asked the server (who never told us her name) to kick up the heat on the 2nd round - still only worth 2 chillies. The drinks were kinda tasty thought; we got Shiso Mojitos in very small champagne glasses for 3 and half bucks. So that was cool.\n\nThe service was sllllllllow. The server was nice enough (although she made some comment like monkey-see-monkey-do that really rubbed my brother the wrong way). We ordered several rolls the 1st round (about 8). They came out about two at a time with about 10 mins. between each set. So we remained hungry the entire night. Maybe this was the plan for us to order more rolls. But with 7 adults at the table, we'd each have a piece of roll and have to wait for more food to come out. It was frustrating.\n\nThe seating was just horrible. We reserved for a party of ten. The whole restaurant seemed as if it would only seat 50. In order to get food into the main dining area, the server has to pass in front of the restaurant's entry door. This \"restaurant\" is more of a cafe'. If everyone that we wanted to share in this occasion came with us, the restaurant would not have held everyone. If they have a party of more than ten, I am pretty sure they'd have to close the restaurant to other guests.\n\nThe best part of the evening was the end. My son got a free ice-cream desert for being the graduate. The gratuity was not added in, so we could appropriate an adequate tip-to-service ratio. And the bill for the whole affair was still under $200.\n\nSo if you want an inexpensive sushi meal, this is a good place for it. But I wouldn't go out of my way and make plans to go here. It's a good drop-in-on-the-way-to spot but nothing spectacular."

The servers are top notch and since it's not a big resturant you get constant service which is really nice. The waitresses are all very nice, beautiful and so helpful and it makes the experience that much better. \n\nIt's located in a shopping plaza and is right next to a PT's Pub but don't worry you don't smell smoke or get any of the noise from PT's which is great! The inside is very trendy, cool and not too dark. The walls are covered in posters from all the Cirque Du Soleil shows with the perfomers signuatures, very nice touch. If you like sports you can still at the little bar (seating about 5 people max) and watch the chefs make food while you watch the two tv's behind them.\n\nThe food is downright amazing and I like how nothing is overcooked, undercooked or bland. The flavors are perfect and you don't need to add anything, just sit back and eat. Of course they have the ususal soy sauce, wasabi, etc but it's not really needed; I always eat a ton of wasabi just because I like the way it burns my nose haha. Also if you're into saki then you will love their large selection of different types! I tend to go torwards the stronger ones myself but I also like their sweet flavors. If you're looking for a great place, away from the Strip, trendy, cool, fun and tasty then check them out!\n\nP.S. - They don't close till around 1 or 2 am in the morning so it's kind of a late night place as well."

            "review": "How this place has such good reviews is beyond me. Extremely disappointed that I found it on Yelp. Outdated reviews perhaps? Tonight was our second and last night here. This is by far the worst sushi restaurant I've ever been to. \n\nThe first night, we ordered spicy tuna hand rolls and a couple specialty rolls. The hand rolls were okay but the rolls tasted really weird, like lighter fluid from the torch they used and smothered in sauces. we finished our food but was still hungry so we ordered a last roll. I'm not joking, we waited an extra 30 minutes. Our food was already digesting..I walked over to where our waitress was doing paperwork and asked if they forgot. All 3 cooks were standing around. The waitress said, it will only take a few minutes we can make it for you. I said no thanks, we're ready to go. She apologized, and I figured they just forgot (no big deal). \n\nTonight we decided to give it another try, and let me just say I will never step foot in this place again. The fish smelled funny, was chewy, and the rolls were coming out \"one\" at a time. The spicy tuna in the hand rolls tasted sweet like they added sugar to mask the old fish. I was so turned off by the yellowtail sushi. it smelled and tasted so fishy, and still had skin on it. I stopped eating it and waited for my last roll, which never came. after 45 minutes and seeing that the cooks were all standing around, again, I called for my check. The waitress came by, looking all confused. She said, why did you cancel the last roll? Did you have too much to eat? (Like we're scumbags and just cancel food that's already being prepared) I said no! We ordered so long ago, and pointed over to the cooks who were all leaning over the sushi bar, talking to each other, not making any sushi. It doesn't look like they're making it any time soon, I've had enough of this place. \n\nThere are tons of other sushi places out here, and for $100 for 2 people, it better be good! Do yourselves a favor and don't waste your time or money. I'm sitting here with an upset stomach and felt compelled to right this review."

I dislike getting treated like Im bothering someone to help me be seated or like I'm a \"number\" Although it gets quite busy here, I never feel unwanted or like Im troubling someone!\n\nAs far as the menu.

My first time was for the happy hour, and the second time was for the reverse happy hour. We always get the 3 rolls and 1 drink on the HH menu. \n\nThis time round, we got the sunset roll for the special roll, and the spicy salmon and salmon skin standard rolls. \n\nThe sunset roll was really good, it's basically salmon roll with tuna added on top (I hope my memory serves me correct on this one!) and I really enjoyed it. I remember liking it a lot because it wasn't fried, has no cream cheese in it and wasn't baked. I can't really get around the idea of baked sushi to be honest, and it's just too weird a concept for me. Maybe I'll get one of their baked rolls the next time. \n\nSpicy salmon was pretty standard. I didn't really like the salmon skin roll too much- it was a little overcooked and I had a hard time biting through the salmon skin, it's too crispy and hard. Oh, and we also got an edamame as our yelp check-in deal. That was pretty nice. \n\nService was pretty attentive. Our server is the same petite, friendly asian lady that we had the last time. This time round though, she did try to sell us seltzer water and asked us a little too many times if we wanted to order more. Once or twice is okay, but I always felt that if you asked me like 3-4 times if I want more food, it does turn me off a little. Good thing she always ask with a smile, and I suppose she is after all, doing her job. \n\nI'll probably be back just for the happy hour. To be honest, I kinda hope they condense the menu a little- all the fancy names for the rolls get me really confused, and I take a longer time trying to process through the menu. Not a good thing if they want to increase their turnover."

The waitress was kind and very attentive. One and two stars there. \n\nAfter that, it was all downhill. Since we went there during their \"specials\" hour (4:30-6 on Sat) we ordered off their deal menu. Not really exciting prices; they were between 4.50 to 9 bucks. Where we live, that's usually normal price. Minus 1 star. \n\n We ordered california, tiger,(both $8) spicy tuna, and another simple roll (both $4.50). Taste: between a \"ehh\" and \"this stinks\". Minus another star. \n\nThe last star was removed because this place was just not that great. I'm hoping we just had a new sushi chef who couldn't really make good sushi; or maybe we're just spoiled in LA. But really, I was dissapointed.

They have an happy hour too and it's not bad. I'm actually surprised that they don't have a second restaurant for how well they do. Their sushi is fresh and they don't soak their rolls in overly sweet sauces to cover up bad fishy taste. Good old school sushi restaurant before all the all you can eats came along."

My favorite special rolls here is the Sunset and the Sun Devil.  Those are available for the happy hour.  The Chef Special rolls are to die for!  My three favorites are the Angry Wifes, Burning Spider, and Crabacore. The service is always great here. They definitely remember regulars.

Usually at sushi places, we order a couple rolls and if we're still hungry, order a couple more. At this place, we have to order everything at once or we'll be there all night... which isn't always a bad thing! I love the happy hour, some of the rolls are normally $12 but during the happy hour they're $8. The fish tastes fresh, the price is fair, and the selection is varied. There's really something for everyone. I love sushi, and have tried many places around Las Vegas. To me, The Naked Fish is the best fish for your buck!"

Thank you!!!\n\nAlthough there are plenty of sushi options available at any of the Big Hotels on The Strip, The L. and I wished to experience sushi as the locals would. So a $30 taxi ride to Spring Valley found us at a little strip mall area with Naked FIsh in it. Immediately upon walking through their door we knew we had done the right thing by trekking out to SV. They were welcoming, gracious and appreciative that we made the trip out to see them. (Happy cabby too, LOL)\n\nThere was short wait then we were seated in the main dining room to the right beneath one of the many signed posters by the various troupe members of Cirque du Soleil. If it's good enough for them... !!!\n\nWe ordered a Sake Sampler, three shots of various sakes and some green tea. The tea was endless and delicious! And it was served in these wonderful cups emblazoned with their logo. I want them! :))) (Tried to buy some but they were out of new ones)\n\nFor our meal we got:\nGrilled Sea Bass with Miso Butter Appetizer. New for us. A big hunk of fish. Delish!\n\nThen we did chef choice 14 piece sashimi which consisted of  Striped Jack, Amber Jack and Snapper (all from Japan and were new to us) as well as salmon, tuna, octopus and squid. We also got a scallop which was presented on a beautiful shell which must be for presentation as it had holes drilled into it. And then we had Yuzu Tobiko which was ah-mazing. Our server was phenomenally nice and professional.\n\nThe dessert,, a slice of green tea mousse cake was not my favorite but the green tea ice cream which came with it was pretty good. I do not think they make the desserts in house. :((( I am sure they would be better if they did.\n\nWe were very pleased that we did venture so far out off The Strip for a meal which though it involved an expensive taxi ride was well worth it! And we would happily go back. If I could just get some tea cups...\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Oc-sqly_Y"

It's right around the corner from my house and it has a great view of the strip. Also, our last experience at our normal sushi spot was a little more than disappointing.\n\nI know I've eaten here a few times before and it's always been delicious, but unfortunately it is not AYCE, which is always something I look forward to for the price. \nSometimes, you need to spend a little for quality, and after last nights tasty selections, I will embrace that philosophy for them. \n\nWe ordered the Screaming Orgasm Salad (a must), the Ultimate Naked Roll (yum), the Lisa Lisa (my boyfriend loves the crunch and cream cheese) and the Roppongi roll (super yum) All were top notch. \n\nThe tuna on the Screaming Orgasm was the freshest I've seen yet in this town. The color was perfect and the cuts were clean. I wish I had taken a picture of it, but by the time I thought of it, we had already devoured the plate. \n\nThe Roppongi (the waitress told us it was the most popular roll) was pretty darn delicious as well. Probably my favorite, along with the Screaming O.  All the rolls we ordered were great. \n\nThe price wasn't all that bad, considering the quality of the meal, so although it is not AYCE, and most sushi places are offering that, I would recommend Naked Fish if looking for some top grade fish."

When we usually order this, it is generous portion of 'premium' fish. However, although the portion was pretty good, the quality of the fish was not so good. Uni-which they only gave us one piece, when usually two, was very fishy, and their shrimp was horribly sweet as well as their tamago. Salmon was one piece cut into two small pieces, and I could tell because i saw the knife mark. Overall flavor of the rice too was WAY TOO SWEET. The furikake that they put on the rice was overwhelming that we had to remove all the top part of the rice; however, the fish that was covering the rice was already absorbing all the sweetness so it was too late. We also ordered natto maki and mentaiko & ika maki. Those were not too bad, but we have had better natto that the ones at NF. \n\nAlso, their service was just HORRIBLE. The server doesnt even greet us and asks us to order. We order one item and he just leaves the table- and that was how the whole serving went last night. We ordered cold sake, and the ice hole had one single ice in it. One ice probably won't keep a sake cold enough. Also, he would just leave the bottle at the corner of the table, not saying anything, so we didnt even realize the bottle was there. When it got to be HH, we had to ask for the menu, but the server never came to the table to take our order but he did make sure to go around and check on the other tables. We ended up ordering through their manager, who when we complained about the service, just didn't care at all and took our menu away. Surprisingly, we received our orders, but we were so ready to leave the place. \n\nThere are so many restaurants recently opening with better quality and service. No wonder why Naked Fish gets slower everytime I go.\n\nPs) some of their items on happy hour menu are offered at same price as their regular menu."

It's a cold dish best served on a hot sweltering day. When I was living in Vegas, I got this dish at least once a week during the torrid summers there. The Zaru Chirashi comes with tempura shrimp, fried quail egg, seaweed and some other goodies all on top of either soba or udon noodles. They give you a separate bowl of sauce so you can dip the noodles in. \n\nThe rolls here are also great. I love the Lisa Lisa (crunchy roll), 911 (spicy crab crunchy roll and Ulti-Oh! Mega roll. The lunch menu has combo roll deals for a really great price. Dinner is pricier here so I'd stick to the lunch menu. \n\nAnother note, you'll often see a Cirque Du Soleil performer dining here.

The 1st time we really enjoyed ourselves, this time not so Much! \n\nWe were seated at 5:55pm and our server came by to introduce herself and get our drinking order. She returned 10 minutes later at which point we asked about when the Happy Hour menu ends. Her response was at 6pm, sorry. (Boy thanks for the heads up when we sat down!)\n\nThere were 4 of us, two adults and two kids, we were given 2 food menus and a drinks menu to use and a third food menu after we asked for another menu for our daughter. As we were discussing what we wanted to eat and drink we realized that the 3rd menu and the drinks menu were gone (they'd taken them without asking and before we had even ordered!)\n\nWe ordered drinks, miso soup and a few rolls and and asked if they had fresh wasabe. The server answered of course!\n\nThe soup came and was pretty good! Then the food came and I again asked for some fresh wasabe, answer, \"of course\". Ten minutes go by and most of the rolls were handled well by my wife and kids, I'm still waiting for the wasabe. I got her attention again and after another 5 got what was supposed to be fresh wasabe. \n\nI tried the wasabe with the two pieces remaining on the table. Nasty! It was 90% regular wasabe paste with 10% semi stale \"fresh wasabe\" mixed together.\n\nWe ordered some more rolls and I asked for actual real fresh wasabe, \"Pretty Please!\".\n\nThe items came but of course no fresh wasabe. 10 minutes later after having to ask again she brought what looked like paste but tasted a bit closer to what I was looking for. \n\nWe ordered one more set of rolls including a rainbow roll with real crab meat as we were still hungry and after 30 minutes waiting and us telling the water lady to just cancel and bring us the check the rolls arrived. We needed to use a magnifying glass to find the real crab it was about 1/10th the size of the cucumber in the roll with sparse fish on top. We were still hungry, but annoyed so we asked for the check. They never asked if I wanted another beer and refilled our tea and water only once.\n\nThe bill came to $155, including a $3 up charge for the minuscule snow crab substitute for imitation crab and $2.50 extra for the not so fresh wasabe.\n\nThe food was OK, but we eat sushi at least monthly and have been to sushi restaurants all over Vegas, LA, San Diego, SF Bay Area, Hawaii, Florida, Australia, etc... Not even average by our experience!\n\nThis will be our last time at Naked Fish. Sushi Tower just a few miles away is much better for less money and they know what fresh wasabe is.\n\nOther reviews: http://www.thelasvegasevent.com/?p=38988"

Our original plan was to go to Sen. but when passing Naked Fish, and remembering our superb dining experience almost two years ago (we moved away and have since come back to the area) we abruptly made u-turn to enjoy this atmosphere. \n\nFirst, the view. From any booth you can see the entire strip. For non-Vegas local, this is a mesmerizing view - and it's a clear one - Stratosphere to Luxor. \n\nSecond, the warm greetings. Very friendly. Asked where we would like to sit, instead of traditional table herding. \n\nThird, quick service to provide drinks. Their sake menu was amazing. Everything was color coded and classed and easy to read. With much experience in sake, I could easily say this would be great for rookies. \n\nFourth, excellent menu. We dined to the point of gluttony. \n\nKobe beef tataki with garlic chips - amazing!\nNegi toro roll - melts in your mouth\nOrganic miso soup - best I've had\nOrganic miso with clams - SO had, three large clams included\nNigiri variety (Japanese uni, chu toro, salmon belly, hamachi belly, tuna, halibut)\nTwo rolls (sunset - the best roll I've ever had in my life, soft shell crab) \n\nThen dessert. SO got the strawberry sorbet and I got the green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (favorite dessert ever) with fresh whipped cream and a surprise scoop of strawberry sorbet. \n\nNot a cheap date night ($180 with sake bottle, but tons of great food). But well well worth the money. Served an excellent celebration of moving back to Las Vegas."

            "review": "-Late night happy hour review-\n(TL; DR - I prefer Yummy Grill & Sushi strictly based on their late night HH menu and their offering of nigiri at HH prices. Naked Sushi isn't a bad choice for late night sushi, but they also don't offer a great selection on their HH menu, they are more focused on rolls. Hey if that's your thing, ymmv!) \n\nI can't help but compare this place to the other local favorite, Yummy Grill & Sushi. I'll list the main similarities. \n-No AYCE\n-Open late - past Midnight\n-Offers a regular happy hour\n-Offers a reverse (late night) happy hour\n-Locals love it\n-Great reviews on yelp\n\nHere's the main difference: \n- Yummy's happy hour menu is much larger, with a better variety and also offers fresh and delicious nigiri! \n- Naked's happy hour menu is minimal and is mainly driven by cooked items and sushi rolls. \n\nWe checked into Naked Sushi's on yelp and received a \"special\" appetizer, which was a small basket of edamame. Then we went straight to business and looked over the menu. The regular priced menu was extensive, but we specifically wanted to check out the late night happy hour menu available from 10 pm - 2 am (last call is actually at 1:45 am.) The late night happy hour offers one page of items ranging from: discounted beer, sake, soft drinks, appetizers, a tiny selection of a la carte rolls, or you can try their 3 roll combo, where you can select 3 rolls from their specified list for $21 - it's technically is a good deal because the majority of their rolls on the regular priced menu have a high price point - $14 each!? Yeeesh. \n \nWe decided to give the 3 roll combo a go and selected (2 rolls from their standard roll list and 1 roll from their special roll list) \n\nLet me start off by saying, if you are like me and like to know exactly what's inside of the roll, well, their happy hour menu is a little disorganized and it becomes difficult to decide what roll to choose because they only list a random roll name with no description as to what's inside of it. We first tried asking our waiter what's inside of each roll, but then we figured that we would be there all night since we wanted to know the description of all 23+ rolls! We then realized that the regular menu had some of the descriptions of the vague rolls, so we thought it would be quicker to start flipping the pages back and forth to read the ingredients (instead of waiting for our server to try to remember whats inside of each roll...) Trust me, it all became very time consuming.\n\nHere's what we finally ordered (in a fit of hunger) truthfully, we couldn't stand flipping the pages back and forth anymore: \n\nHaley Roll (Standard Roll) - shrimp tempura with avocado and crab. It's your typical, basic, crunchy roll. But why was it soggy and not crunchy? Flavor rating 3/5\n\nJapanese Lasagna Roll (Standard Roll) - baked cream cheese, mayo, inside simple CA roll. The roll was rich, sweet and warm from the oven. It wasn't the worst version I've ever had, but I definitely wished that there was some sort of texture besides mushy/ soggy. Flavor rating 3/5\n\nGrand Canyon Roll (Special Roll) - mix crab salad filling topped with baby scallops, mayo, baked, and topped with some roe. I honestly was not impressed at all. It's way too simple to be considered on their \"special\" roll menu. The tiny, minimal amount of baby scallops is just a gimmick. The roll wasn't memorable. Flavor rating 2/5\n\nThe same could be said on all 3 rolls:\n- soggy, no texture \n- same flavor profile: basic + sweet mayo + unagi sauce\n- filling, so you do get a bang for $21\n- yet, I have to emphasize: definitely not worth regular pricing $14??\n- they don't taste bad, but I guess I just expected more. \n\nAlso, the other items we ordered off of the HH menu were disappointing: \n\n- Organic Miso soup (so fancy, I know) tasted fine, but came out lukewarm- not hot. :(\n- Baked Mussels were filled silly with a crap-ton of imitation crab and topped with pungent bonito flakes, which took away from the flavor of everything else, also, not juicy and the tiny, bitty piece of mussel got lost in the madness. (Bonito flakes are great, but I honesty felt that it killed the flavors here)\n- Salmon Nigiri wasn't sweet, it was fibrous and tough to chew. \n- Ama Ebi - which was the advertised special of the day and it was huge! But sadly, it wasn't sweet at all and very firm and tough to chew. My paranoia tells me it's aka-ebi and not ama-ebi...\n\nLet's end the review on a positive note: The best thing all night was the albacore nigiri!! It was super delicate, moist, sweet, fresh, and buttery. I would recommend ordering that for sure!"

Although it's not a long jump from the other sushi bars off the strip, it's decent and in an okay area. \n\nI wouldn't go there everyday like I do with Yummy Grill & Sushi on Tenaya and Lake Mead, but it was a change of pace for that day."

Happy hour is usually right when they open for an hour then again at 10pm - 2am! Suzy and Wanda are amazing. They always greet me by name when I walk in. George, Alfredo, Peter, and Giovanni are always such great energy and fun to talk to when sitting at the sushi bar! I'm usually a very picky eater but I have no problem trying new things because they're so good at what they do! I highly recommend this sushi spot!

After  trying several places within our area, Naked Fish clearly wins. We have been frequent guests for close to 6 months and have not attended any other sushi bar. I am proud to call Naked Fish my 'personal spot'. \n\nIt is very intimate and small, which allows the service to be 5 star. The quality of the sushi is perfect and the presentation is appealing. \n\nThe happy hour special (check website for latest times) is a great deal. My favorite deal is the lunch specials (weekdays 11am - 3pm). They have several different combos, but the one I get includes: Miso soup, salad, and 2 rolls for $8.95. \n\nI highly recommend this place - I have been there 10+ times and have yet to have a bad experience."

If you check in on yelp you get a free ice cream dessert-- which is basically a ball of vanilla ice cream covered in corn flakes.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/naked-fishs-sushi-and-grill-las-vegas?select=ik9mlCszVZBbBJWPmrFKRg#ik9mlCszVZBbBJWPmrFKRg We didn't like that combination at all... the dessert we much preferred was this chocolate fondant.  SO RICH, and brimming with molten chocolate; hence its other name, simply \"lava cake\".  \n\nA few of the other dishes I liked were the grilled sea bass, fresh soba, and udon.  This place is quite a distance from the strip, but good if you want to enjoy a more relaxing/ low key dinner.\n\nI wouldn't particularly recommend any of their rolls-- they were just ok.  A bit dry perhaps."

After all, this IS supposed to be a sushi place.\n\nIt seemed that the wait staff were all Japanese, and I was surprised to find out that the sushi chefs were not.  This is unequivocally a bad sign.  I order a couple of rolls and a few nigiris directly to the sushi chef.\n\nMy goodness, I must have waited 15 minutes until anything came out.  I even asked the chef if he remembered what I ordered and he said yes, but that he was busy.  \n\nDid he look busy?  Well yes, in a way, but he was pretty slow and inefficient, and although he was the younger of the 2 chefs, but the other was no faster.  Besides, out of 8 or so seats on the counter, there are only 3 people.  \n\nReally, if someone orders a sushi at the counter, you serve them immediately.  This is fundamental.  How do I know this?  I'm Japanese, have eaten in many of the best sushi restaurants in Japan including many Michelin starred sushi places in Tokyo.  I really shouldn't be comparing Kyubei or Sukiyabashi Jiro with a place in Vegas and I'm not, but \"sushi chef\" not understanding these fundamental rules of sushi?  That's why I said it's a bad sign when a sushi chef is not Japanese.  They just don't get it, he was certainly no exception.  When someone at the counter is order sushi, you go right at it.  It's only 4 total orders for 2 people, how long does that take?  well it took him 20 minutes, quite irritating.  \n\nSo how was the sushi?  Mediocre at best.  Too hard of a grip, too little air in the rice, sushi rice was not to my liking.  fish was decent, nothing spectacular as people say.  But after 20 minutes of waiting for 4 pieces of sushi, it's a lost cause at that point.  \n\nAll in all, I was quite disappointed. I'm going back to my usual place.  Where is that?  I'm not telling any random people, but if people really like the sushi here and is serious about wanting to taste/learn sushi, I think they need to start listening to their own palate and go to Japan and have some real sushi so that you have something to compare to so that they can have a \"standard\" sushi in their mind.  This was another nanchatte sushi."

Well the place is small and intimate which I really loved but it wasn't everything that I suspected it would be. The service was just so so. The rolls were very good but the presentation was just blah. I had two rolls, miso soup, a drink and endamame. The edamame was way over cooked and that is seriously the simpliest thing to make- its just blanched soy beans. Anywho- the one of the rolls I ordered had bay scallops inside which had some kind of mint inside which added to the flavor. If created a nice woodsy/citrusy flavor that was a great addition. But my cousin ordered the spring rolls which had this same mint and some kind of other flavor that was so overbearing it destroyed the simple an light flavors that are so familiar in a fresh spring roll. The sauce on the dejavu roll was phenomenal. All in all a good place but not exceptionally great."

The last two times I went here which includes today I had to ask for drinks which bugs me because it's not that big of a spot. Service has been slow lately for reasons I can't explain. Today started with a dirty miso spoon, not a huge deal but when added to the rest of night was kind of the cherry on top for me...nigiri prices/ pieces changed, sooo normally nigiri albacore would be 2.5 for a TWO piece nigiri but I guess someone had the bright idea to change it to ONE piece. Lol seriously a small ass piece of sushi for 2.5 and everyone else is charging that for a two piece? Seems like they are getting greed, I don't sea a reason to pay over 2.5 for a literal \"bite\" of sushi. Anyway! Then we wanted some yellow tail \"one piece nigiri\" lol which was also 2.5. When the waitress informed us they had yellowtail belly for the same price, so we took it. When my party received the bill the yellowtail belly wasn't 2.5 but 3.0! While this isn't a major problem being its only 50 cents extra per piece...the point is that the waitress informed us it was the same price when it clearly wasn't. To add insult to injury I'm going to complain about something irrelevant to the original complaint which is the pictures on the back wall have been crooked and hang awkward for at least a year! This might just be some ocd ish but good lord fix that! I always had the imagination that sushi spots were had good fend shui hahaha not this one. It bugs me to even right this because this is one of my favorite spots, but the owner/manager need to work on the customer vibe...food is great though"

The cucumber sushi came with fresh raw tuna, salm\u00f3n amd imitation crab wrapped around cucumber.  The Angry Wives sushi roll was DELICIOUS, and it came with lobster, salmon, avocado,  wasabi and the different sauces on top. Everything tasted so fresh, and the customer service was great!

We waited to be seated around 15min, but had no reservation, so that's ok, we were actually glad that it's crowded, which means it's good. We  ordered the Sashimi B, in the picture it seems big, but we were very disappointed, it was cut very very thin and was so small that we had to order 3 other plates to be satisfied, and we are not very big! The we ordered 2 edamames (these were good), 2 rolls and one salad (Tuna\"O\" salad that the waitress said it was seared that ours was full of sauce, not seared and a lot of greens, not what we were expecting at all!). Unfortunately, there was nothing to make me come back. When we paid, the lady that seems to be the owner, asked if everything was ok and I said that we were disappointed, and she only said \"I am sorry\". I think she is to busy and doesn't care about losing some customers. Really disappointing, since we live so close, we'd be very good customers. At the end we spent $100 for not a lot and not quality food. Not going to have our business anymore... The pictures here have NOTHING to do with the real plates there."

Boy was he right, the interior design gives off a warm and cozy vibe and the people here are really nice.  Although I did wish our dishes all came out the same time, the atmosphere of it was great.  \n\nSince I was a first timer, I didn't know what to order and so I turned to yelp for some help. I ordered the:\n\n- Naked pizza - this was delicious, I tried forever to figure out what the dough was. It tasted like crunchy rice with something to hold it together.  All I know is that it was good. It's a definite must if you're here.\n\n- Yuzu Salmon - OHHHHH BOOOYYY! This dish made my night!  The rightly sliced salmon placed with onions and some other sauces that complimented the texture of the salmon. WOW! I would definitely order this again! It was my favorite out of the whole dishes.  \n\nNzu Mussels - It was action packed and delicious, but it's nothing I haven't tasted before.  The shredded crab was a good compliment to the mussels, along with the bonito shavings.  \n\nHamburger Steak w/ teriyaki sauce - It was an ok dish, a little too much on the sweet side.  Probably not something I'd order again.\n\nJapanese Lasagna Roll - I'm not a big fan of baked rolls, just because the rice always comes out a little too soggy.  \n\n911 Roll - It was good, but nothing special\n\nWasu Beef Kushi - OMG! The meat for this was so tender and juicy, it felt like an explosion of goods in my mouth.  Although it's only one skewer, it's well worth it to try it once.  \n\nThe menu is small, and a little on the pricey side but the dishes are delicious and have flavor.  I'd probably return here to try out some other dishes, I wish they'd extend there menu.  Not unless they have a secret menu no one's telling me about?"

Grilled to perfection, it is juicy and tender...absolutely delicious. So good that I took a bite before snapping a photo...such a bad yelper. I flipped it around and made a photo happen regardless though ;) The miso butter sauce compliments it perfectly but is great without it as well. \n\nOverall the quality of their fish is very fresh. Prices are reasonable. You can get an amazing meal here for the price that you would pay at an AYCE sushi joint but enjoy an overall hands down better meal.\n\nService is great.

It's fittingly dim and restricted to certain number of tables that are accompanied by the wonderful sushi bar.  I've always found it entertaining to watch sushi chefs whip together the splendid rolls I so so crave.\n\nThe sushi chefs at Naked work quickly and precisely in every roll they make and the servers and wait staff are friendly and knowledgable.  Needless to say after my fifth roll and third order of sake I was satisfied and pleased with the entire experience.  Along the walls of this particular restaurant the signed photos of every Cirque De Soli show are displayed.  I was told by fellow co-workers the entertainers in those show frequent this wonderful Sushi restaurant.  I guess I can fully say I share their feelings and look forward to my return visits."

The staff tried a little too hard at being friendly, borderline intrusive, but was quick for the most part. The rolls came out in a timely manner, though the Hamachi Kama (salmon collarbone) took awhile. Drinks were refilled often. \n\nComfort: One star. I sat in the center table and it was quite cramped to get in and out with the big chairs. This problem is magnified on a busy night as people are walking all over the place and it is a journey just to get to the nearby restroom. I sat at a table for four, though I was with just one friend; I could imagine it being exponentially uncomfortable if the table was full. The booth seems like it would've been a better experience. As every business day goes by, I don't see how they haven't noticed this issue. Maybe they do but figure it's not a problem worth fixing.\n\nFood: 4 stars. Above average. The rolls were delicious and well crafted. Presentation was simple yet appealing. The Hamachi Kama was pretty standard, alongside the shrimp tempura. I wasn't thrilled about the Miso soup. I didn't finish it; maybe because it isn't really my thing, but it did seem quite salty/subpar. \n\nThey offer a choice of one free of two appetizers if you check in on Yelp (hey, free is free; but now it's obviously more of an advertisement than a good deal as it doesn't say choose from two); edamame or cucumber salad (which I opted for). It was decent.\n\nOverall a 3.5 stars. I could easily add another one star, and this place could become a go-to spot, if they worked on those issues. Prices were standard to a little high ($40-ish if you want to leave full). Not really feeling this place right now, but I'd probably come back again during happy hour when it's cheaper and less crowded."

She started us out with some sashimi platters, one of which was albacore with a citrus sauce that melted in your mouth like butter! The others were equally as excellent, such as yellow tail in a ponzu sauce topped with green onions and jalapenos. She followed up with some awesome rolls, 3 of which I can't get out of my mind... Sun Devil, Sunset and Roppongi! One of our party was allergic to salmon and Wanda took special care to point out which rolls she should avoid. We ended our feast with mango and green tea Mochi, and it appeared to be homemade... (not the Mochi you can get in the grocery). Interior is pleasant... with a relaxed atmosphere. Certainly not opulent if that is what your looking for... but we all raved  that it was quite possible  we just ate the best sushi we had ever had!"

Naked Fish's is the once and forever king of sushi in Las Vegas, and today I was fed a royal reminder of that fact.\n\nI asked for \"some sashimi, whatever's good today\" and beer. Those may have been the most wisely chosen words I'd ever uttered. I was served bluefin, otoro, uni, red snapper, and something else, with fresh wasabi. Let me comment directly on a couple of these.\n\nIn all 3 of my previous experiences with uni, 2 of which were at sushi places in Vegas that I otherwise really enjoy, I just didn't like it. I felt like it was odd that people considered it a delicacy and I just didn't seem to understand why. Today I learned why. The uni I ate at Naked Fish's today was absolutely superb, and I melted with glee after my second - and third - bites.\n\nFresh wasabi? I've never once seen this in Vegas at any place other than Naked Fish's. It's such a nice touch and, for me, a critical part of enjoying the unmatched quality of fish served here.\n\nThis review is already far longer than I originally planned.

I came here again after a long time, and I must admit the food is as good as ever. My cousin (a culinary expert) commented that the quality of sushi at a la carte restaurants are usually much better than AYCE restaurants. I definitely have to agree with him on that.

Living up in Summerlin, we wanted something really close to home. 5 minutes away, with pretty good reviews, was Naked Fish. We decided to give it a shot.\n\nIt's in a typical strip mall location. Walking in, the restaurant is small, but very warm and inviting. It was also pretty danged quiet. We were greeted immediately and we asked to sit at the sushi bar. \n\nMy favorite part of a sushi restaurant is the bar. Naked Fish's bar seats 4 kinda comfortably, 6 completely uncomfortably, and the sushi bar intrudes on the dining area. We had to pull in for other customers to get to their table. Minus a star. Immediately. The dining area is small, but pleasant. \n\nThe staff was attentive and kind. Ray, our sushi chef was friendly. \n\nWe were given cucumber salad with this sticky sweet dressing and sesame seeds. Yuck. We were not given hot towels to wipe our hands with, something we've always appreciated. We were also not given edamame, something we always get for free at nearly every sushi bar. The server came and took our drink order, and we did notice they had a very impressive beer and sake menu, at decent prices. Alas, this dumb cold had me ordering hot tea. \n\nWe also ordered edamame, which cost $5. While the order was large, it  overcooked and soggy. Minus another star. \n\nWe ordered tuna, yellowtail and salmon sushi. The fish was a nice size, fresh and tasty. Earn a star. \n\nThe rolls all left us uninspired. We searched the menu for quite a while looking for something that appealed to both of us. We finally settled on the GR3. The fish was fresh, but it was boring and bland. For our second roll, we asked the chef for something complex and spicy. He recommended the Oh My Gosh. We ordered it, without cream cheese (on a bagel? Yum! On fish? No.) The fish was fresh. The sliced serrano chili was hot. And besides that? Boring and bland. Minus a star. \n\nWe wanted to love it because of the location. We didn't. We won't be back."

We got seated and looked over the menu, we narrowed down our selections and waited, and waited, and waited for someone to take our order.\n\nFinally, our server appeared, we wanted a few rolls: Kiss Me, Lisa Lisa, and WSOP.  She told us not to choose Kiss Me, she says many don't like it. She suggested GT-R, instead. Fine by us, our diet cokes were soon delivered. They had an odd taste, like peppermint or something. Our rolls arrived and we dug in, it was only the WSOP roll we were fond of, it had yellowtail and jalapeno. We were still hungry, but we asked for the check, we were put-off by this point. Our total was $40 for two drinks and three rolls. The rolls were not worth $12.50, pricey, especially to leave hungry... I'll stick to Hokaido Sushi, it's closer to home, tastier and a better value. I paid the tab, and my husband placed an order for a pizza. So, we did not go hungry, but it was an expensive appetizer."

What ruined all 3 of our experiences was somehow managed by 1 person, the older host. She was so rude every time. 1st visit, didn't come to us until 45 min into our meal for a drink order. 2nd visit gave us the wrong change back claiming we didn't give her extra and I found it on the floor by her cashier. 3rd visit was a smug comment wanting to split a 20$ check with \"it's only 20\" \"you girls can't pay 20 full\" and \"oh wow ok\""

It is well liked by the cast of most of the Cirque Du Soleil performers and their walls boast giant  posters of the shows with signatures from all the performers. Their staff is very attentive and warm, and every time I go I can't wait to see Wanda. She is the best server there. She is very knowledgeable and knows every ingredient of every dish. If your having trouble deciding whats good, she's the girl to ask!\n\nYou really feel at home and welcome. The atmosphere is slightly darker than normal for a sushi restaurant, but it sets the atmosphere for good times and romantic dinners.\n\nAs a repeat customer and die hard fan of Naked Fish's, it would be the first choice out of any sushi restaurant in the city."

We waited about 15 minutes to be seated which is fine but once we were seated, the waitress gave us no time to get settled in and came over to rush our order. \n\nShe did not offer a greeting, recommendations or even a smile. She had the personality of the salmon sashimi, which may possibly have been the worst we ever had. It was slimy and fishy and at $12 per order, not even close to being worth it. \n\nI am very disappointed with the yelp community for praising this pretentious and unfriendly restaurant. We spent $70 on a meal and enjoyed nothing from the menu nor the experience. We will never go back. \n\nActually, the Cali roll, although very small, was tasty. Also, the other waitress who had to help us because our waitress disappeared during our dinner and the beverage runner who helped us more than our sashimi waitress, were very pleasant and friendly and made me wish we could have tipped them instead.\n\nWe have tried many sushi places in town and for those of you looking to enjoy the whole experience of dining out for a quality meal that you are paying for, please avoid this spot. Go instead to Soho (west side) or Miko's Izakaya (east side). They truly raise the bar. \n\nActually, pick up some sushi at whole foods and dine in before you spend your money at naked fish's."

Once I realized they got double order,I told them I didn't order2,then she said \"oh really?\" And looked at me like, SO??what? \nSo I said to them that's okay. After that,she asked me 'do you want other order instead of that then?' \nUhm.. why don't you ask me to get a refund and I don't take the order whichs I didn't order then. \n\nWell..that was okay cause I wasn't expecting good services from them because I've been went this place so many times and their service was just okay (even I went so many times and always put 20-25% of tip their service was so-so)\n\nHowever,I went this place about few days ago for togo order. And I was really disappointed! ! The girl who looks like host person. She looked mad all the time and when she handed me my food,I'm the one who tell her thanks and have a good night. She doesn't answer me at all and just showed me that mad face. I want to ask her Where are the hell is your customer service?? \n\nThe reason why I've keep ordered only for togo and stop going to seat and eat in this restaurant was because I don't want to see you guys' services anymore.!! And I really want to give a 1star but their foods are good so I left 2stars. \n\nRegular customer is not your friend. \nI'm a still customer too!!

Yes, they are both gone completely, not simply removed from their late night happy hour menu. They have revised the menu and the happy hour offerings. The $3 glass of wine was a highlight of my most recent visit. The 911 and Haley rolls for $4 and $5 respectively are tasty and priced right during happy hour, but for some reason, I can never get full on them. The new happy hour is more focused on the sushi rolls. The non-sushi items are edamame, spicy chicken (fried), shishito peppers (very delicious) and gyoza. I am not sure I understand this change because with numerous AYCE late night options it seems that you could really stand out by discounting more of your non-sushi items. I admit that that is my unfounded, never-owned-a-restaurant assessment, and I am sure they have reasons for focusing on rolls. So, I am not changing the overall rating, but without the asparagus, the joy of their late night happy hour has been diminished for me."

This makes it affordable to eat here often. Plus $1 glass of refillable soda, $3 wine. It's almost unbelievable.\n\nThe food itself is greatly reliable. The Spicy Chicken appetizer is my favorite (I pay $1 to \"upgrade\" to white meat). My order always consists of one Naked Girls Roll. I love that I can order something tonight and it will taste the same as it did 6 months ago. There is a continuity between the chefs that allows this place to be consistent time and time again.\n\nI always request Emii as my server. She is extremely polite and attentive and works the late evening shift, which coincides with when I'm usually craving sushi. \n\nI normally call a couple hours prior, to request a reserved booth by the window.

Even while I am here in L.A., I am anticipating my next visit to Vegas to dine at Naked Fish with my mother again.\n\nWhere do I begin?

I missed out on the Oysters and Mirugai! Unfortunately this place is fresh enough that they run out of their stuff! Which is a DEFINITE good sign.\n\nI could write a long review on the decadence of this place, but what really stood out for me, was the Toro. It melted in my mouth, not quite the way it did at Tsukiji fish market, but as much as I can hope for Stateside. And the Miso Butter Seabass: My beau is allergic to seafood, noteably fish, but he tore it up. It was so fresh that it did not affect him (Nor did the Toro). In fact, he loved it so much, he pounded it out, absorbing everything, and said that it was quite possibly one of the BEST things he's ever had in his mouth.\n\nI cannot wait to come here again!\n\nIt is also very affordable, legit Japanese food.

She's very informative and details of each dish was emphasized to the point where I could have envisioned it right before my very own eyes! \n\nOur appetite chose the Shima Aji - Striped Jack (specials), Premium Uni from Santa Barbara (specials), Shigoku Oysters (specials), Avocado Roll (HH), Yuzu Salmon (HH), and Yellowtail Jalapeno (HH).\n\nMy loves:\n\nI admit.. all those specials we ordered were FRESH. It felt like we were at sea and they just caught it. Opened, cut it up, and served us ;) Shima Aji had a clean finish.. pure texture as in smooth and rich. If you've been looking for sashimi with no fishy odor/taste and ends with a sweet, calm note.. Shima Aji is the best for Summer! I would order this over and over again. Highly recommend this special while it's around. \n\nPremium Uni here could possibly seduce you in falling in love with Uni, itself. Obsessive kind of love. Beautiful presentation. The color of a sliced mango.. deep, deep orange. I get a kick out of the grainy texture that reminded me of a very dry tongue. Say Ahhh!!! Buttery, sweet, and fresh tasting. Surprisingly, it has a hint of floral. It came with a generous amount of 4 pieces of Uni per nigiri order. I was in Uni heaven!!! Layer after layer I was relishing each bite. Definitely order this or you're going to be missing out on something truly pleasurable to your taste buds. So good, sooooooooo GOOD. \n\nYuzu Salmon presentation had bursting, vibrant colors that made the dish so enticing. Nicely sliced and pleasantly clean flavor.\n\nUnfortunately, the flash flood warning went off at the restaurant and my phone. So we had to scarf down on our last dishes of Avocado Roll and Yellowtail Jalapeno sashimi. Looking through the window from our comfy booth seating.. those clouds look mean.. destructive mean. I had to ask for the check pronto and told our server, Wanda.. my MINI can't survive any floods.. I have to get going.. and she goes.. then you better go. While the staff yells out thank you.. we took off like ghost rider. \n\nThis place was packed during Happy Hour (HH) 5p-6p/10p-2a and love the fact that they played some great UFC/MMA fights while enjoying our meal here. My mom was oddly engaged in those matches. Getting my attention with.. Look! Look at this guy get kneed in the ribs!!! I was like what the heck he lost from that?! UFC/MMA sushi action! Naked Fish is as real as it gets for your Sushi needs! Clearly won my heart for Uni Nigiri!!!"

It's gotten progressively busier the longer we've been going which is a positive things for business but a negative one for wait time when they are packed. The servers always remember us tho and know our preferences before we ever say a word.\n\nI always go here for the happy hour, usually around midnight. It's not AYCE sushi but I prefer it that way.   I don't like AYCE places because, although they work for some, I never eat enough for it to be worth it. This is a great place for a sushi fan that wants to take time to savor  their favorite rolls, give a new roll a chance and sit back and relax with companions.  I also like the happy hour menu. It recently changed and I'm not sure if I like the new or old menu better. The old menu had everything I wanted and while the new one boasts more variety, the prices are a little different an what I want comes out to a dollar or two more. It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make for a few new experiences tho.\nI usually order the Japanese lasagna and Philadelphia roll with no avocado on either (I'm allergic. It's tragic believe me). I also get a side of green bean tempura or Gyoza depending on my mood.  \nJapanese Lasagna - I absofreakinlutely LOVE this roll. I can't get enough of it. It's just so flavorful it's a mouthgasm. The cream cheese on too just gives the entire ensemble an extra flair.\nThe Philadelphia roll is a tried and true classic that I can't get enough of. The fish is always so fresh and delicious.\nThe green bean tempura is something that I always crave. It's just amazing. The green beans are crisp and have the perfect little snap when you bite into them. \nI've tried a variety of other rolls and I really enjoy the Naked Girl as well as the Haley roll. I've definitely found. A few items I love and I've  stuck with them but I know that when I'm ready to branch out all of my options are delicious.\nI recently tried the Lobster roll and I have to say that it was amazing. I'm not usually a lobster fan but I'll make exceptions for this roll. It was delicious.\nOverall I love this spot and they take their time to make you a part of the family. Over time they remember your name and face and get into a habit of reading you by your previous preferences. They really are awesome. I give a 4 overall because every place has their flaws and honesty is my priority for other yelpers."

Our server was very helpful recommending a few select rolls. The Roppongi roll was pretty damn tasty, the Japanese lasagna roll is always amazing, and the haley roll was pretty good for being a roll on the cheap. 3 rolls and two beers shared between me and my wife were just what our stomachs needed. A nice nightcap I suppose... I of course wanted to try one more roll so I chose the grand canyon roll. It was another baked roll much like the Japanese lasagna roll so to me it was like a premium version of that. Overall our little happy hour adventures at good ol' Naked Fish always makes for a delicious evening. The staff are always friendly and very attentive. For cheap late night sushi, this will always be our go to place."

The good thing about having family that lives in town is that they can always steer us to their local haunts.  So, we headed back out to the westside to check out Naked Fish's.  \n\nThere are times when I'm in the mood for some traditional nigiri sushi, and there are other times when I'll check the inner sushi snob within at the door and eat anything.  I'm usually not a big fan of fusion rolls, but their Roppongi Roll is actually quite delicious!  We also ordered up some Chicken Gizzards, Kalbi, Beef Tongue, Soft Shell Crab Salad, Soup, another roll (no idea what it was, but it was tasty as well), Natto Makizushi, Shrimp Tempura, and probably a few more things.  Service level was good, and we left filled to the brim."

Whether it was their Ultimate Naked Roll, Kai, Dark Circle, or Dragon Fly everything was just good. Their gyoza, soft shell crab,  mackerel, shrimp tempura, and Asian lamb chop, and Japanese spaghetti were all good as well. But one thing that really stood out and still bothered me was the bonzai roll, it just had the fishy seafood taste which is a sign of bad sushi. It was really bad. Could have just been a bad roll. Everything else on the menu is good though.\n\nService:\nWait staff is very friendly and helpful. They were very friendly with the young child that was in our group, giving him a toy car and quick to clean up the small mess he made. But, the wait staff wasn't shy about offering our Vietnamese co-worker a fork, since he kept dropping his sushi with the chopsticks. BURNNNNNNN!\n\nPrice:\nAfter comparing to other sushi places, Naked Fish is price fairly competitive based on what you get. You can't compare to all you can eat places, but if you want quality sushi without breaking the bank this is the place to go. Rolls range from $6 all the way to the $15 Ultimate Naked Roll. \n\nGreat high quality affordable sushi, with fish being shipped daily from Japan. If it wasn't for the mishap with the bonzai roll, this place deserves a 5 star."

Naked Fish's was a great surprise to us.\n\nWe had great service that was incredibly friendly. We started off with the Screaming Orgasm salad (an ahi tuna over some fresh greens and a vinagrette dressing), which is not on the menu. That was great and then we had a bunch of nigiri sushi and rolls. Everything was fresh and excellent but the thing that really got us to rave \"this is REALLY good!\" was the Japanese Lasagna. Wow, we could not get enough of that - very addicting.\n\nMy only regret?  My 4 year old daughter (who LOVES sushi rolls) was so tired from the day's events that she ended up sleeping through all of dinner and missed out. My 7 year old son, however, thought the rolls he had were delicious.\n\nEven better, since my son is allergic to cow's milk, they had a mango sorbet. It was a bit pricey for a sorbet but it was actually frozen inside half of a mango skin and was quite plentiful. Turns out that they get the sorbet imported in from Italy already packed into the mango skin. My son was in heaven!\n\nWhen we are in Vegas again, we are certainly going to be hitting Naked Fish's again!  We are already recommending it to our friends who are visiting Vegas too."

They knew their food. \n\nI went with the group of 9-10 people, so we ordered a lot of different things: sashimi, nigiri, some standard rolls, special house rolls and baked rolls. We didn't ordered it all together, but all rolls were served very quickly and we didn't have to wait for anything. And as much as I usually don't care much for sashimi and nigiri, I loved them here. The salmon was really good, even by itself. Other than that, Dragon, Rock'N Roll, Kiss Me and Lobster were fantastic. They also have a super tasty raspberry lemonade and a free appetizer for a Yelp check in. I still miss this place sometimes... :("

Most of all, the quality of their fish is marginal.  They weren't fresh (hamachi was dry and most all other fish lacked any kind of flavor or taste of freshness) and their rice isn't cooked or prepared right.  Secondly, their fish and rice portions are very small.  You really don't get much for the price you pay for.  In fact, my sushi slices were cut so thin and small that I could hardly taste the flesh of the fish.  The makis...their sauces contain too much sugar.  And again, very small potions. \n\nTheir green tea has no flavor either.  It's green in color, that's about it.  I spent $53 for 4 orders of sushi, one spicy salmon roll, and fresh shrimp (the head was fried but was too greasy to eat).  The place isn't good and it is relatively expensive.  I don't mind paying for good food.  Sasabune of Los Angeles is my favorite sushi place  They do everything right and use the freshest high quality fish.  And they do their rice right.  \n\nFind a better place than Naked Fish Sushi."

Funny when you see the lady sitting at a cheap probably 3 month life span sushi restaurant eating frozen tuna raving about the freshness and quality. Here is the low down because your hearing from someone that really knows: \nFISH COMES IN ALL TIERS AND PRICES FROM THE SUPER CHEAP TO TOP QUALITY (Remember you are what you eat) \n1. All the purveyors nationwide will sell frozen tuna if given the chance (all you can eat sushi bars Todai, I Love sushi etc, etc. and cheap poke places) Let me tell you the process: The manufacturers will take old tuna of poor quality that didn't sell at market usually staring to turn rotten and brown. They then fabricate and process using carbon monoxide , smoke and food coloring, hence the bright red color. After this they vacuum seal, freeze and sell to fish purveyors for pennies who then sell to restaurants for just a little more. Then YOU get stoked when you can enjoy all you can eat tuna sushi at a shitty sushi bar that is fluorescent red colored because all you worry about is quantity not quality. \n2. All Hamachi sashimi is farm raised poor quality from Asia. Wild caught Yellowtail or its' cousins will run a market price of $40 - $50 a pound translating to $12- $14 for 2 pieces of sushi. \n3. Salmon mostly farm raised because the wild stuff can cost a restaurant double triple and they figure that they can dress it up enough with ponzu sauce or mayo to the point where no once can tell the difference. Also the farm raised salmon live in very contaminated polluted environments with the water being constantly diluted with antibiotics sometimes (USDA and FDA knows this) with agents that are carcinogenic and/or harmful to human beings. \n\nAnyway enough on the boring education, ignorance is bliss. Naked Fish is by far the best place in Las Vegas to get sushi off the strip that is unpretentious and with a reasonable price tag considering the quality. Sen of Japan is great but don't want to pay $300 a head for a Nobu's knock off. Service at Naked Fish is great and they take the time to get to know their customers. My only complaint is that I wish they would expand to more traditional Japanese dishes, but given their diverse clientele it is understandable."

My boyfriend and I shared three rolls: The Lisa Lisa roll, the Sunset Roll, and Tiger/Dragon roll. \n\nMy favorite was the Lisa Lisa. The outside of the roll has an incredible crunch to it and a mayo sauce that is probably the best I have ever had. The fish tasted like fresh fish that did not have the nasty fishy taste that we have all unfortunately experienced once in our lives. Thank goodness this place has FRESH ingredients all around. You see the sushi chef's make your food to order. The place looks and feels clean. The waitress was sweet and did an excellent job giving us recommendations. I highly recommend the Tiger/Dragon roll if you love eel and avocado. The sunset roll was also tasty with a hint of spice to it since the inside had spicy tuna. \n\nWe did not get dessert, but the ice cream that passed by us looked pretty tasty! Get a large Sapparo there or the plum wine. It will add a nice addition to your overall meal. I will definitely come back here again since it is reasonably priced and away from the strip so getting there is much more convenient. I recommend calling ahead to see how long the wait is. On weekends, the place can get pretty busy! No worries though there is a PT's nearby which you can stop in there for a quick drink while you wait for your table."

The staff is very friendly and accommodating, they won't brow beat you if your party decides to hang out and drink for a few hours. I have only tried the sushi and appetizers, which are both quite good with fresh fish and creative preparations. Our fav roll is the Tiger&Dragon which consists of a shrimp tempura roll covered with spicy tuna AND unagi(eel). I would quickly and heartily recommend Naked for a weekly date night spot, or to even try once while visiting Vegas with friends."

I have never sat at a table or gone with a large group so this review is just based on chilling at the sushi bar and enjoying the food. \n\nThey are generally always busy which is great and important for a sushi place. I used to have a saying that I only eat the fish if I can see the water, but Vegas has SOO many fish and sushi places in town that fresh fish is flown into town all the time. \n\nQuality of food here is really good and the chef's are fun and interactive.. Occasionally I would ask them to look out for a certain type of fish and they occasionally will get it in and remember that it was you who asked for it.... The only reason I did not give it five stars was that they don't carry some fish and other japanese dishes that I got used to having all the time when I was living in San Francisco.... but hey, this is Las Vegas... \n\nBonus points for being open late and having a lovely wait staff..."

Most sushi places I've tried are really inconsistent when it comes to food, but Naked Fish's is always great. Wanda is so great and I always feel so welcome whenever I walk in. Even when they're slammed with customers, they'll go out of their way to make sure you're taken care of. Seriously, check this place out!!\n\nP.S. Definitely try the Lobster Roll. It's my favorite thing in the world right now. It's completely insane!"

Their Roppongi roll is probably the best.  This place is more like izakaya/tapas, so if you are looking to be full or eat a lot, it's not a great choice. They have a quiet few selection of wines and sake, so if you like to drink liquor and have some good fresh tapas, it is a good place to go."

            "review": "I love these naked fish. I highly suggest arriving at 10 PM (they are open until 2 AM every night) and taking advantage of the happy hour menu. You can get three rolls and a beer for a very reasonable price, as well as some budget friendly appetizers. Although their normal menu is fantastic, whenever we go at happy hour we end up paying half the price and still feel stuffed. \n\nThis is a small restaurant, but unless you go on a weekend evening, there shouldn't be much if any wait. Service is fast and friendly, and it is quite cute inside, too. \n\nThey do this great tuna salad (I forget the actual name of it), and they have some really inventive and tasty original rolls. The fish is always fresh and cut well. Other highlights have been the green bean tempura, squid, and any roll that involves an element of crunch. \n\nParking is no problem as it is in a strip mall (it is in a nice enough neighborhood, though)."

Only reason I gave 4 stars was my brother in law ordered donkatsu and it came without rice. We were told rice was extra! Other than that had a great experience but wish they had an all you can eat because ordering outside of happy hour would be a bit more than I would spend."
