My girlfriend and I spilt some sushi which was splendid! Very fresh. If your in the area def stop at this spot to try it out."

            "review": "3.5 stars\n\nOhjah doesn't rise nor sinks when compared to other Japanese restaurants, they just provide decent food with good service. Their sushi reflected that mayonaise, rice, and raw fish do not bode well together. Our party ordered three rolls but it was difficult to distinguish which was which. Each was slammed with 10 lbs. of spicy mayo and sweet eel sauce over flavorless spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, and/or cream cheese. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but the phrase, \"Which roll is this again?\" was spouted during the course of the meal. \n\nIf there was a shining light in the meal, it was my hot entree. I actually enjoyed my spicy chicken. They were generous with their meat, the veggies were cooked perfectly, and it came with soup and salad. However, they should omit spicy from the description. It was more sweet and salty. I asked for extra spice but instead got an extra layer of red sauce. Other parts of the meal included a well excuted tempura. In the end, they gave pre-packaged hand cloths to wipe away all the grime and residue of your greasy claws. They have a hibachi grill if you want entertainment and flames. The atmosphere evokes dark and romantic but the clienteles are big-ass families with waistlines that match."

I love their fried rice so much flavor, I honestly love everything about this place and I recommend it to everyone. \n\nI go here about 2-4 times a week which is ridiculous!!! STOP CONTEMPLATING JUST GO!"

It could have easily been too sweet but it wasn't.  \n\nWe started with a spicy tuna roll and that was also really good. And of course the hibachi - perfection. Filet, shrimp, scallops - all great. \n\nWe loved it and will be back the next time we're in Vegas!"

We ordered Beef Negimaki for our appetizer which was incredibly tender and full of flavor. I would come back just for this alone. I ordered the hibachi noodles with Filet mignon, which I was please to surprised it included the hibachi veggies, and salad and soup. Soup was so-so but the salad... Wow so simple yet so wonderful, something about the dressing you can't find anywhere else. My steak was cooked medium TO PERFECTION! I've been to fine dining steak houses that weren't as good and tender as this! My husband orders the fried rice (which I kept steeling, the scallops, and the chicken. The chicken was probably my least favorite, flavorful but a tad over cooked... I'll stick to my filet mignon. Great place to bring out of town guests, This place is great for birthdays too. We will be back!"

No one. Customers or hostess. \nUmmmmmm......so I walked to the left a little and realized that the hibachi area was around the corner in a different room.\n\nWe walked ourselves around the room then found hibachi area.\nI posted several pics.\n\nHonestly it reminded me of the \"ol'school\" Benihana.......I just was not impressed. You have zero servers and if you get water or a drink you are lucky. The grill master Ven was suppose to be the best but just acted like he did not care that night.\n\nI got the Sushi Fiji and hubby got the Prime hibachi. Mine was just a pile of unfrozen bay scallop looking fried madness and hubby kept telling Ven \"NO I'M ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH\" when he kept trying to throw shrimp in his mouth.\n\nOur friend order a roll and saki......he was also not impressed.\n\nIt is next to a new Lee's Liquor's that has craft beers.....that's another ball of GOOD YELP wax :)"

            "review": "I'm a fan of Japanese steakhouses so I was excited to try this place. Dinner started with soup and salad which comes with every teppanyaki meal. The salad dressing is amazing!!!! I am not a fan of salad, but I loved this!! It is really sweet and doesn't taste like any other dressing I've ever had. Each order comes with soup, salad, vegetables, and the choice of fried rice, noodles, or steamed rice.\n\nThe basic entree is $8.95 with the items listed above, then you add whatever else you want. For example, I ordered Filet Mignon and Shrimp Teppanyaki which added $13 to the basic price. I like the menu style because it is  \"Mix & Match\" so you can create the perfect meal.\n\nThe steak was delicious and very good quality. The shrimp however had a very strong shrimp taste which I don't like. (I am very picky about shrimp!) After dipping them in one of the sauces provided it was better. Finally, the fried rice was delicious!!\n\nOverall: Delicious and inexpensive teppanyaki dinner! I would say they are in the top 3 :)"

Picked up dinner here on the way home. Had Chicken and Steak Teriyaki dinners - both were really good, love the soup - nice to get an onion broth rather than miso, salad dressing... what is in this stuff??? I'm in love - like typical habachi ginger/garlic dressing only creamier... also there was one little crab ragoon with the dinner that was super tasty. Steak was tender - chicken good too. Sushi was good, only tried a California roll to test them out - so can't really comment too much on the sushi. Husband had a couple hand rolls he liked. So all in all, pretty satisfied. They do seem to be a little pricy - but I was pleasantly surprised with the meal."

Next, went to the bathroom to check the cleanliness - spotless! \n\nThen the staff was so friendly. From the way they spoke to you to the way they cleared our table, great service. \n\nYou gotta see MANDY! She was so patient, understanding and funny. She made me ver comfortable for my first time. I will come back again. I went to \"I Love Sushi\" and I didn't enjoy my experience there and so I haven't been back to a sushi place in years because I didn't enjoy my experience - until today! \n\nCome to this place and bring your friends!"

This was a pretty good deal as it included 3 specialty rolls, salmon, ahi tuna, and hamachi sashimi, seaweed salad, and three types tobico for only $45. Just the specialty rolls were $10 - $12 each so it was well worth it. We also ordered the lychee Saki, they had a few different kinds of flavored Saki which are good for those don't like the original flavor of Saki. We were told the boat would take about 15 min but they served us each an order of the house salad as we wait. \n\nWhen the boat came out I was very impressed by the presentation. The specialty rolls were OK, but what put the boat over the top was the slices of sashimi. Each slice was about half and inch thick with about 3-4 slices each. The quality of the fish was superb and with each bite you certainly can taste the freshness. In my mind what differentiates a lot of these sushi restaurants is the quality and freshness of their fish. Ohjah certainly displays fresh quality ingredients. \n\nI would love to come back and try their Hibachi. But would definitely come back for their sashimi."

We used to frequent more often than now, so we hadn't been in some time, but I have been to this location well over fifteen times.\n\nLet me start off by saying the food here is definitely good. I cannot comment on the sushi, as I have never had it but the hibachi is always solid. Tonight we went and things seemed weird. \n\nIt seems like Ohjah is getting cheap with their product. First, the chef told me he wasn't allowed to use extra garlic on my shrimp (or really use any garlic at all) because it is not procedure and he would get in trouble. Apparently management/ownership was getting annoyed with people asking for extra items and not paying. I would gladly pay for extra rice, veggie, etc. But garlic?! How expensive can a tablespoon of garlic really be. I would have paid for it had he said \"garlic is extra\" but he didn't; he just made it clear he wasn't allowed to use any garlic on ANY meat item other than steak..... Okay. \n\nSecond, I have never counted the shrimp I get on my plate, but I would say they used to give you 8-10 shrimp per order. Today I got 5. Once again, okay. \n\nThis was not the chefs fault by any means. I just feel as though ohjah is getting a little skimpy on their food. Hibachi is not cheap, so I will likely take my business elsewhere next time where they will gladly add garlic to my food."

Food was good but nothing spectacular, but spicy tuna rolls, tempura, and edamame all seem to taste the same everywhere after 3 or 4 tall asahis.\n\nSecond time I came for the tepanyaki.  The chef was very polite and friendly.  Engaged us but wasn't intrusive in our dinner in any way.  Had the filet and shrimp (both cooked perfectly)\n\nOverall this place is clean, food is above average compared to other sushi establishments, service is great, and it's up the street from where I lay my head.  Only reason I can't give 5 stars is I still have to pay for the food."

The spider roll had crab meat in it and of course that paired perfectly with the soft shelled crab, but I've never had it prepared that way.\n\nThe highlight was a sushi rolled called \"Captain\" that was one of the more delightful rolls I've ever had. It had crispy fried onion rings on top of spicy tuna and some kind of garlic sauce. Serious yum and kudos to the sushi chef who came up with the idea!\n\nI will definitely be back.\n\nThanks, Ohjah!"

We love sushi and hibachi and have ate at many hibachi type restaurants in and out of Las Vegas. So I was excited and had high hopes of a new restaurant close to home. When we first arrived I noticed the interior, it's beautiful, classy and not the typical Japanese decor that so many other places in town aim for. We were seated and I immediately noticed not only the wonderful smell of others already enjoying their meals, but the menu. Every item is al a cart, reasonable and inexpensive. Considering that we have spent well over $100 at like restaurants in the past for a party of two, I was presently surprised and already liking this place. But let's be honest, if the food is crap.....the prices really are irrelevant right? \n\nSo, we both ordered different meats to try more of the menu. Me chicken, he steak. The chef came out and was fantastically funny, sweet and incredibly skillful while cooking. It still blows my mind the cracking and throwing of eggs lol. Anyways, back to the food. It was great! The rice was fluffy, the vegetables were tasty and the meat was cooked to perfection. We have since ate here many times and we have never been let down, I have tried all of the meat/fish items on the hibachi menu and they're all equally delicious. Did I mention I don't think our bill has ever been over $60 including tip? I haven't tried the sushi because the hibachi is so very good it's hard to try something else, when we usually only go there because that's exactly what were craving. I recommend everyone check out Ohjah on Decatur and Blue Diamond."

Once my meal is through I go next door to the booze joint, buy a bottle of dessert, then slam it once I get home. It's win-win, baby.\n\nWhen you walk in through the single tinted door the seating area is to your right and the sushi bar straight ahead. I always sit at the bar so I can watch sports on TV. To the left of the sushi bar is the hibachi room. Dark, friendly and kind of exciting if the patrons' behavior is any indication.\n\nSince I'm in a Japanese eatery I always start with a flask of cold sake, usually Kurosawa. (They have several different sakes, domestic and imported beers, wines, and well drinks. There is no full bar or bartender, however. The server assembles/retrieves your cocktail.) While sipping from the tiny glass that is kindly refilled by one of the very attentive and fawning Asian lassies, I peruse the appetizer list. To date, I've had fried oysters, shrimp/vegetable tempura, fried pork and a few others. Many things to choose from. As for entrees I usually stick with sushi and have had most of the offerings listed on their extensive menu to which I've provided a link. I can honestly say I've never had bad sushi rolls here. I steer clear of the ones that come with cream cheese but have had most of the others. Those with salmon or crab are my favorites. The plates are always artfully arranged and very prompt in arrival.\n\nOhjah is kind of my new hangout and only minutes from home. See you there soon."

Meat was tender...not dried and tough like (Benihana's) and the shrimp and lobsters had great texture as well not chewy or fishy. The fried rice was yummy very garlicy just how I like it. I also got the Sushi and Shashimi boat for myself. Which is pretty awesome and more then enough food! come with 3 specialty sushi rolls of your choice and 10 pcs of nigeri 6 pcs of shashimi and a side of seaweed salad. BOMB!\n\nAll in all I loved this place and will be back and how cool is getting your sushi served on a freaking Boat Man?!?!.....Super cool!"

Although I was not very hungry when I visited, the service was very friendly and food was fresh. I came here with my fellow yelper Al, and our gyoza, california roll and chicken katsu was worth returning for. \n\nTheir menu includes other dishes besides sushi, and they also offer a hibachi grill side of the restaurant which looks very nice....and very affordable. I will certainly visit them again."

I wanted to make sure I wrote a review because it's somewhat off the beaten path in a small \"strip mall\" area next to a liquor store. Place could be easily missed.\n\n Tried several items on the menu (some lunch special). For 2 people, 2 apps., 2 miso soups, and 3 sushi orders - came to about $40 w/tax. For apps, had the chicken skewers. It wasn't that bad, but it was bland. I knew to stick to seafood.  The miso was good not too salty. The only roll I can recall the name of is the \"Valintine\" (sp?)\n\nI'm not certain if it's because they're new, but having a website would be helpful, especially because they deliver. Overall, the place was clean, service was quick, and food was tasty."

A little something for both genders.\n       - Owners - First Japanese restaurant that I've been to that had Chinese music playing. You usually see them owned by Japanese or Korean in Vegas. \n       - Soup - They said the soup was onion soup, but I'm pretty sure it was winter melon. It's a pretty traditional Chinese soup. They said they also had miso.\n**Ordered**\n       - $12.50 Unagi Don - A decent sized piece of eel as far as eels go. A tad dry, but not bad. It comes with soup and salad. Good for those who don't want a big meal.\n       - $14.95 New York Steak Teriyaki - A fairly large steak cooked to your liking covered in teriyaki sauce. It also came with a crab rangoon, salad, and a soup. Definitely worth trying if you like steak teriyaki (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sYfHxCqHpIX2HnDhw0JRAA?select=KW4CtKWK4DPBM0uOuXgjFQ).\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd recommend this place if you live near Blue Diamond. It's a nice place to eat without having to drive too far."

I, myself like their sushi combos because you can choose 2-4 rolls from the menu (a deal on it's own), plus you get some pieces of nigiri sushi and some selected sashimi.  The price is decent also!  However if you do order one of these sushi combo platters and also plan to eat regular food off the menu (that's lots of food by the way), you should probably put in your sushi order first because they do tend to take a little longer to make these combos for some reason.\nI never tried the hibachi, but there's always lots of people in there so I assume it's pretty good.  \n\nAll-in-all, this is a good neighborhood family restaurant and it's worth a try."

They joke around with your table and do all the fancy tricks such as making the volcano onion, making the shrimp bunny, etc.  \n\nThe food is cooked exactly the way your ordered it.  It's very tasteful and the sauce they provide work perfectly with the items you order (fish vs meat vs chicken).  \n\nDon't forget to check in because you get a free small sake bottle which was awesome! \n\nThe price is very decent compared to other places such as Benihana.  It's about 40% less than the other hibachi restaurants.  \n\nI ordered there house combo which was to pick any 3 items for your dish.  It was a surprise that the filet mignon was able to be part of your 3 items.  \n\nThe staff are super friendly and never has disappointed me.

I do want to say that I become more and more dismayed at the number of sushi establishments that don't even offer a simple Spice Crab roll muchless a specialty roll with spicy crab in it. It seems when I ask for this 'unheard' of ingredient they look at me as if I have a third eye or something and unfortunately their answer to spicy crab = \"a california roll with siracha rolled into it\" is unacceptable. For those who do not know how to make spicy crab it is merely imitation crab stick chopped up just like they do for the crab salad with a tad bit of siracha and japanese mayo. The sad thing is that the easy way would be to just chop up a crabstick and mix it with the already available Spicy Mayo.... just sayin' \n\nBut I digress - the hibachi menu requires that you order the 8.95 base selection which is just your soup, salad, veggies and rice. Scroll down the menu a bit and it gives you the selection of meats and fishes that they serve Hibachi style. Kobe beef runs 48.95. We chose to have the Hibachi combo which allows you to choose 3 selections (excluding Lobster, Halibut and Kobe) but is a nice plethora of flavors that you can try as your meal.\n\nThe chefs are very entertaining, the meal is exciting to watch and the final outcome was really delicious. We didn't want for drinks until after the show was over and then we had to flag someone down a couple of times. Not terrible but they had spoiled us during the show serving us every time the glass became half empty.\n\nI would definitely like to go back and see if they can do better with their response for Spicy Crab :-)"

Especially with the great quality of the food here.\n\nI can only rate on the hibachi section (where they cook your food in front of you) since that's the only part I've experienced. You first start out with a small soup and salad. Veggies are already included in your cooked meal. You choose between fried rice and fried noodle (basically chow mein). Then you pick your meat. They have a pretty good range including chicken, NY steam, filet minion, shrimp, calamari, kobe, etc. They really slab a lot of the food with butter, but I assume that's why it all taste so good.\n\nChefs are very entertaining. They do all sorts of tricks with their knives and try to entertain you with the food. \n\nThe only reason why I am taking off one star is because I encountered 1 chef that was a bit rude. Usually when I come here, all the chefs are pleasant and funny. Recently when I came, the chef asked how I like my steak cooked. So I said \"well done.\" He gave me a nasty look and said \"really? Why bother get filet minion then?\" It caught me off guard as he came off like that. In my head, I thought why does it matter? He should of just cooked it the way I requested. I felt like he was complaining because he was impatient and didn't wanna keep standing there just to cook mine. It shouldn't matter how one likes their steak...just cook it. I wanted to complain to the manager, but I didn't wanna make that big of a deal of it. \n\nSo I'm sorry if you encounter a douchebag chef, but most of them are really nice. Just hope it doesn't offset or ruin your night. \n\nPraying that y'all get a decent chef next time. ~"

I pass by this place everyday and was anxious to try this new restaurant on Decatur and Blue Diamond. On my way home from work, I saw their \"Open\" sign lit up so I called my husband right away and told him to meet me there for dinner.\n\nWe were greeted warmly when we walked in and were asked if we wanted to sit at the bar, a booth or if we wanted hibachi. We opted for hibachi. The hibachi room was huge and there were eight cooking stations. \n\nMy husband ordered the Special Rolls Combo for $23.95 and got the Dragon Roll, Spider Man Roll and Kamikaze. I ordered the Filet Mignon hibachi which came with vegetable teppanyaki, house salad, miso soup and your choice of fried rice, fried noodle or steamed rice for $16.50.\n\nThe sushi was pretty good... Normally my husband and I like raw fish but since I'm pregnant, he ordered all cooked rolls. I especially liked the Dragon Roll because the salmon was cooked with a nice charred taste. I think I may be used to AYCE sushi so I don't think I sushi would be my first choice when I come back.\n\nI enjoyed my hibachi meal and our chef was entertaining. I watched three different hibachi chefs and it looked like they all had their own tricks up their sleeves. The house salad was good but they were a little too liberal with the dressing. I enjoyed the Filet Mignon very much because the meat was tender and flavorful and cooked to my preference.\n\nI was too full to order dessert but I want to try the tempura ice cream next time. The only three dessert items are ice cream, mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream.\n\nThe service was top notch even though they had a lot of patrons. We were checked on regularly and we didn't have to wait long for our food or our check. The service was surprisingly good for a restaurant's opening day!  \n\nI will be back again since this place is super close to home. I'm so glad this place that I have been keeping tabs on is finally open! Ohjah was definitely worth the wait!"

Loved the detail with the food presentation as well. The sushi was amazing! It melted in your mouth and you can tell the sashimi was fresh with the correct temperature without the VEINS popping in your mouth! As for the teriyaki steak it was to die for!\n\nSo in the end we couldnt finish everything.. we didnt even need to order appetizers we were so full we had so much left overs from the sushi and the steaks..\n\nBut of course we still made room for their famous tempura icecream which was so good!\n\nI must say you can tell a huge difference when ordering from an all you can eat sushi place.. \n\nOhjah is one of my top 5 japanese place and I will of course return  and will be a loyal customer!\n\n\nP.S. they also have the hibachi tables if you are into that.."

Three filets were ordered and cooked perfectly, I ordered salmon which was a bit dry but I used a dipping sauce which satisfied my taste buds. Serving portion is huge - no need to order any appetizers if choosing hibachi. We also ordered a bottle of Fuji apple sake, only 8% alcohol so it's very weak.

The reason for my three star instead of five star rating is because of the \"extra charges\" they put on our last bill. We spent almost $200 on food, so to be charged for something like refills on the iced tea was very annoying! We were celebrating a birthday and anniversary, we asked the waitress if they would sing happy birthday. They sang and brought out a small piece of cheesecake, then charged us for the cheesecake! I have never been charged for a \"birthday\" dessert! I'm sorry but if I just spent almost $200 on food the least you could do is throw in the slice of birthday cake. I really like this place but charging us for those silly things will make me think twice about going there next time. In fact, the next time I have a craving I will try the hibachi place closer to my house."

Unfortunately  the day of the party showed me why it'll be the last time I'll never give them my business again. First we arrived 20 min early for our reservation, we were seated 10 min early and 1 guest hadn't arrived. They sat us down and said they wanted order before last guest arrived even though we were early. The habachi was by far the worst we've ever had the chef was an older gentlemen who was grumpy and not into it. My kids were more into the other chefs serving other people. I've never in my life been so rushed to finish dinner, without asking me the waitress brought out cupcakes while the kids were still eating their dinner. They did not ask me if I was ready, she lit the candles and came out singing off tune with just herself. Because there was 8 of us my tip was not my choice then the owner came up and said is there something wrong? In the same sentence he told me he didn't need the table but then said if you want to relax and eat come at a less busy time. I was once a loyal company and do were the other 7 parents of the other children, now all 8 couples will not return and we'll make sure to tell others about our experience. I held my tounge until the owner passive aggressively approached me. We sat in the front lobby for 20 minutes  after that waiting  for parents to come. It was raining like crazy and I wasn't going to  have 7 8year old standing outside and I wasn't about to stay after the owner said his piece."

I was a little hesitant about the restaurant choice because I've never had a taste for sushi, but the majority rules, so I agreed. It was the night before New Year's Eve, and the restaurant was pretty much filled. Chefs were putting on shows at many tables. Patrons were clearly enjoying themselves; the restaurant was buzzing with laughter and excited chatter. Our service started off a little slow, but soon we had our appetizers. Everyone in our group had sushi; mine, thankfully, was cooked. And it was very good! Between the delicious appetizers and the salad, I was enjoying myself in spite of my earlier reservations about going to a restaurant known for its sushi. I could have left at the point and been very satisfied. \n\nBut then the chef - I believe his name is Van - came over to our end of the table and started an amazing display of acrobatic and culinary showmanship that was a joy to watch. He introduced each element to us and was soon flipping things into the air and even flipped a cup into his hat all the while keeping a fast beat with his cooking tools. Fascinating to watch! The scallops and shrimp were excellent, and the vegetables were cooked and seasoned to perfection. But the standout was the steak. The most tender and flavorful steak I've had in years. Melt-in-your-mouth with no fat or waste at all. And we had more than enough to take home for leftovers. \n\nWe left late, and as the chef and then the waiter cleaned the table, we asked what they were cleaning with. Lemon juice, they said - no chemicals. That impressed us. And he said they would clean it again the next morning. Overall, we were very impressed. Delicious food, very clean restaurant (even the restrooms were immaculate), friendly service and a terrific show, too. The Ohjah at Blue Diamond and Decatur is definitely worth revisiting."

I go the the stores next door often and always smell something good coming from this place. \n\nThere were only a few people in the restaurant as it had just opened. We were seated right away and our server was very friendly and polite. \n\nWe got the lunch special that was actually a really good deal! This place doesn't do AYCE and most of the places we go to do. The special included 3 pieces of sashimi (chef's choice) 3 piece nigiri, and a roll for around $15. The quality of the sushi was excellent. Everything tasted fresh. I can't remember the name of the roll I got, but it had a mango salsa on top. It paired really well!\n\nI want to come back to this place for more sushi and to try the hibachi! Definitely recommend it!"

The garlic edamame sets this place apart for me. The food is fresh and tasty. The hibachi chefs are fun and entertaining. The servers are pretty good, but have had just a couple issues. Ordered an appetizer once and it never came. When I mentioned to the waiter to just cancel it because our food was just showing up, the appetizer then came. They ended up comp'ing it because of the mix up and I quickly forgave them. Great, clean atmosphere. Other dishes available for those who do not like sushi as well. I highly recommend it for the cautious and daring alike."

The owner was very understanding and set up a reservation for us to come back. We came for a late lunch around 3:30pm before the rush. The manager greeted and sat us on the hibachi side and the staff was very accommodating. We had Keith as our chef (aka \"Hello Keithy\" he said, which was pretty catchy) and he remembered us from a previous time. He's always very nice, friendly, and in a happy mood which is always a good sign. I do think that the staff's mood is a big part of setting a guest's experience. He was able to add extra garlic to my meal without acting like it was a hassle (which the previous chef was not happy about when I asked last time). My friend and I both had the shrimp and NY steak and it was very flavorful and well prepared. Next time I come in I'll definitely request Keith again."

It was thin as hell, like it just got done fasting for 48 hrs and THEN ran a marathon. The taste was non-existant. For $17, you would expect a decent steak, lets just say that memo was not given to ohjah. The meso soup that came with it was awful. The salad that came with it was very good because of their dressing. So if you want a tasty salad, try ohjah. But If you want a good steak come to my backyard and ill whip one up on the barbie!

The ambiance is beautiful, the waitstaff is friendly and eager to please, and the food it amazing. It's also very reasonably priced for the quality of food they offer. Ever since Nagoya closed down I've been looking for a good replacement. This place is even better than Nagoya in my opinion. I haven't tried the hibachi portion of this yet, I've only sat down for dinner but I'm willing to bet it's a positive experience."

All the seats at all 6 hibachi stations were maxed out.  Really impressed with how fast we got in there.  Most places even with reservations you still have to wait a little.\n\nAll of us ordered the three choice option at the grill which was a lot of food for under $32.  I did shrimp, calamari, and chicken with noodles!  Oh wee it hit the spot!\n\nThe ambience is fairly quiet until the chefs do their thing to entertain then the sound level spikes up, but that's the whole experience it's part of the fun.  My kids (8, 6, 5) haven't had a hibachi experience since they were babies so they finally got to enjoy it.\n\nI checked in and got a free Sake!  Thank you for a great Friday Night!"

We haven't tried the hibachi yet, but are looking forward to it. \n\nThe miso soup is good, and because I'm pregnant I haven't tried too much sushi. I did get a tempura shrimp roll once and was disappointed that the batter was soggy instead of crunchy. However, I recently had the shrimp tempura entree, and it was dynamite, so they clearly can make a mean tempura if they want. The tempura dipping sauce was a little bland. Many of their sushi specialty rolls tend to be on the hot side rather than sweet. I usually don't eat California rolls, but my husband did the other day, and it was the best CA roll I've ever had. It left me scratching my head wondering how a CA roll could be so good.\n\nTheir teriyaki is pretty good. Sometimes the chicken is dry, but the New York steak is consistently good, and tender for NY. They reportedly make their own teriyaki sauce, and do not use MSG, huge plus.\n\nAs for sides, their rice can be inconsistent, but their salads have good dressing and are pretty darn good for iceberg lettuce.\n\nThe service is decent, but there are some new servers who do things like put the food on the middle or end of the table instead of in front of the person who ordered it. Usually not a biggie, unless its hot soup they put in front of a young child...\n\nThat aside, it's one of our favorite \"regular\" places."

They offer sushi at the sushi bar or anywhere in the restaurant and I find it to be of great value and excellent quality.  The rolls are large and filling, definitely worth grabbing if you stop in.  I also recommend the teppanyaki style dining, it is extremely affordable and is of much better quality and appeal than any of the large competitors like Benihana's or other teppan style restaurants in town. If you want to avoid the teppan, you can just grab an entree off the regular menu. We have tried many of the different options and all of them are greatly priced and extremely filling. Many times me and my wife will just split an entree and some rolls and leave their over filled with left overs. If you're ever looking for some good Japanese, I highly recommend it."

There are so many tappanyaki restaurant and Ohjah has the best. The price is reasonable and the food is very good quality. The chefs are super fun and they definitely bring their unique tricks to grill. As for the regular menu side, it's a little more pricy but the food does not disappoint. I wish they offered All You Can Eat sushi, but they don't so getting the sushi platter or sushi boat would be the next best option. I love their sashimi and nigiri because their fish is really fresh. However, if someone your party doesn't eat sushi, they may not enjoy the selection on the regular menu and it would be more ideal to eat on the tappanyaki side of the restaurant. Lastly, I would have to say that the service is a little better on the regular menu side than the tappayaki side. It seems as though the waiters are a little slower and distracted on the tappayaki side. But on the regular menu side, I have to give two thumbs up to the waiters. Often times you order sushi at restaurants and there seems to be a language barrier or something, but here at Ohjah they usually understand what you're ordering and they rarely get orders wrong. I give the waiters a lot of credit for knowing their menu well."

Presentation of the boat was good, except the sushi tasted just a-ok, nothing special compared to other sushi places we have gone to. The sashimi wasn't bad either, but didn't rise to the top. The tuna & salmon --- just okay.\n\nThe biggest upside is the hibachi. Having the chef cook in front of you never gets old to me. The hibachi basic + add-ons were all very tasty, although we noticed the cook did add A LOT of butter when he cooked.\n\nOverall, you should have a good time here. But if you want better tasting sushi in Las Vegas, you're better off at Oyshi, Sushi Tower or Nobu (on the strip)."

We had to drive a little ways since we were staying at Treasure Island but it was definitely worth it. The sushi was very decently priced and yummy. Our hibachi cook was very good. The filet mignon was so juicy, tender and flavorful. I thoroughly enjoyed this place and highly recommend it. :) Would love to go back again."

Before tonight this was just a safe place to try decent Japanese near our home. Having the teppanyaki was the best decision! The cook also puts on a show, like the flaming onion ring volcano plus he launches shrimp from the grill into the patrons mouths. Now on to the food... we got the sukiyaki beef and NY steak (both prepared medium) as well as scallops, shrimp and salmon. For group of five, we just got 2 orders each of the above to share and it proved plenty. Totally loved everything we were served! I finished it all but the rest of the family had to get take out boxes. Also included were a cup of onion soup, salad with ginger dressing and grilled vegetables, which was also pretty good. The service is excellent! We'll definitely be back."

We loved our chef and our food, but whilst eating dinner a check gets dropped off then 5 minutes later the manager checked if we paid.\n\n Although I understand that maybe as hibachi tables stand, there's another group of people coming in, we still felt rushed and needed to get out. We were there to celebrate and to drink with really great food, but we were cut short. I hate feeling like we're being rushed out, especially when dessert wasn't offered. Because we felt like we needed to clear out, we didn't even get to look at the dessert menu again, and I wanted dessert! I mean, we were celebrating. We would've ordered another round of drinks with dessert, but wasn't given the chance and that is the only complaint."

They separate the meats by section and individual price so that you can mix and match your plate however you want. I chose the NY strip steak and the shrimp. My sister tried the scallops and NY steak. MY father tried the sukiyaki beef and NY steak, and my brother in law tried the Salmon and chicken. \n\nYou start with the $8.95 basics which includes the the option of fried rice, steamed rice, or noodles, soup, and salad. This is MANDATORY for teppanyaki. Then you pick from the list of meats you'd like and you just mix and match. They also offer kobe beef at $50 and lobster tail also at $15. The dishes and offerings are typically what you'd expect for teppanyaki. Same quality and flavor. Next time I would love to try the filet minon instead as I wasn't too fond of the NY strip steak. It was tougher and less flavoring. The sukiyaki beef is A GOOD CHOICE. They're full of flavor, tender, and juicy! \n\nOur chef was great, He was funny, and very patient with obnoxious children. So big ups to him. For a total of 4 people plus an order of a glass of reisling and tempura ice cream we spent a good $100.00. Woohoo! What a deal! That's compared to my tab at Musashi which was $160.00 for 2 people! Same quality of food. Same service. Cheaper price. Call me a fan! I'll be back soon!"

We were seated with a lovely family of 6.  All together there were 4 kids under 10 years old, our 2 teens (14 & 16 years old) and 4 parents.  The other Hibachi got the more enthusiastic chef.  Ours was just meh.  The fried rice made via Hibachi is always good but the meat (chicken) was kind of dry and tasteless.  I guess that's why they give you sauce.  What they did not give me was my free sake for checking in via Yelp.  I did order a salmon skin hand roll which was excellent.  I think they do better with their sushi than their Hibachi.  I'd probably return for their sushi, but I was not at all impressed with the Hibachi."

EVER.  We are greeted promptly and warmly every time we dine here.  The servers are always very attentive, and extra dishes are removed right away.\n\nThe restaurant is divided into two sections: the hibachi grill side, and the regular restaurant side (which includes a large sushi bar, booths, and tables).  Although I have only ever eaten on the regular restaurant side, I must say I will definitely try the hibachi side one day because of the sounds, smells, and action coming from that room are incredible! \n\nThe food is also incredible.  Some of the items we have had are: teriyaki scallops, tempura (vegetables and shrimp), numerous sushi rolls (the Black Widow is amazing!), nigiri, sashimi, miso soup, and the house salad.  All were equally delicious (and I'm finding myself strangely addicted to the house salad dressing -- it is mayo based and surprisingly light).  I did find the teriyaki scallops to have a bit too much of the \"char\" bits on them, but other than that, they were cooked perfectly, and the sauce complimented the flavor of the scallops very well.  The food is always fresh and delivered in a timely manner, and the plating is intricate, balanced, and inviting.  The prices are affordably appropriate as well.\n\nI read in another review that this restaurant would be a great \"first date\" place to go, and I wholeheartedly agree (for the hibachi or the regular restaurant side).  The ambiance is very pleasant with simple and beautiful artwork on the walls, and low lighting, giving it a romantic feel.  At the same time, it is definitely a very family-friendly restaurant, and a great place to come with friends (especially with $2.50 sake bombs!).\n\nDefinitely give this restaurant a try when in Vegas, you won't be disappointed.  And if you live here in Vegas, and don't live close to this particular location, there are a few other locations in town (I have been to the Flamingo location recently, and if I were to review it, I would literally copy and paste this review in for that one as well)."

Granted, most of my visits have been during their slower times but I still very much appreciate that they offer it. My only complaint is that every time I visit, slow or busy, I have a very difficult time getting a second refill from my server. This only really bothers me because I can be with one or two others who get three or four refills and I will have to flag them down to ask for one.

The hibachi is freaking awesome, not to mention they have great sushi deals too...must try \"The Boat\", still haven't gotten a chance but it is a sushi display of pure beauty.  The service is always so friendly and quick, they always make sure you have what you need and they encourage that you check-in for your free house sake.  I absolutely love that Ohjah opened up five minutes away from where I live and that I don't need to get dressed to the nines to go there.  Love it!"

Our server was Alice, and I have to say I have never felt so disrespected the way she was speaking to my family. She had the worst attitude she made us feel like we were dumb. This is the second time we have been to this location so we were very familiar how to order but she felt otherwise. We requested for a manager and he was very cool and came back to check on us and refilled our drinks. If you visit this location and you get Alice make sure you know how to order off the menu or you might get laughed at. We won't be back! OHJAH make sure Alice takes a crash course on customer service."

We go there about every 2 weeks and its ALWAYS AWESOME.   Sometimes the company is better than others,  some chefs are more skilled with the knives than others, but the FOOD is Always PERFECT.   You won't hear me say that too often, so trust me when I do. \nThe pricing of the menu is more competitive than other Japanese steak houses.  Its $8,95 base price for the rice veggies and soup, then you ad your meats.  We usually have the Filet Mignon plus either shrimp, scallops, chicken or halibut.  The filet is like meat flavored butter, melts in your mouth.   Actually I wish they used a little more butter in the prep, but its always flavorful and healthy. \n\nWe do usually get a tuna sashimi but I will say this.  the fish is fresh and yummy, BUT its cut in too large of chunks.  I prefer a smaller cut for a more delicate taste and feel.  We ate at the sushi bar once and all the fish was cut too large. \n\nNevertheless,  the The steakhouse, hibachi grill is the BEST in town for the BEST price.  I highly recommend it any day."

One chef will give you a 5 stars experience while the other one will make you question yourself for why the hell you're spending a lot of money for a lousy meal.\n\nMy regular and favorite chef is the tall skinny (Viet) chef who always does an excellent job entertaining guests and also make a good meal. When you go to a hibachi dinner, you expect entertainment in addition to good food. As for the other chef who cooked one of my meals, granted he was very nice, he basically just focused on cooking the food and not very entertaining at all. Even worse, the food was salty and just overall not good.\n\nSince you are sharing the hibachi cooking table with other guests, I'm not sure if you can choose which chef will cook your dinner. Due to this reason, I am now less likely to take my guests here for dinner, which is too bad since this experience is unique and could be a lot of fun compared to strip buffet.\n\nIf you plan to come here for hibachi dinner, make sure you understand the rule of roulette. Your dining experience could land on red or black, and sometimes green :-)"

All around we were greatly entertained!!\n\nFirst of we opted for the Hibachi and I am so glad we did! My fianc\u00e9 loves sashimi so he ordered the blue fin tuna, I do not really care for the raw stuff only in Miami and LA did I actually enjoy it!! Well I am addicted, that blue fin tuna was so so yummy. He ended up ordering another. For six dollars you get two healthy servings and it melted in my mouth with deliciousness! I am sold that is something  that  I will order again and again!\nMy fianc\u00e9 got the trio Hibachi he chose the filet, the scallops and sole!! I ordered the lobster tail. The star for both of us was the sole! It was all delicious but we are still dreaming about that sole!! The filet was yummy and so were the scallops and the lobster but that sole was so memorable and unexpected because I love lobster but the sole was so freaking amazing! By the way my fianc\u00e9 thought the lobster was awesome, too!\nI was not in the mood for sake bombs but my girlfriend that was with us never had one so we decided to get some beer and sake to have sake bombs but the Hibachi chef told us they offer  sake bomb individually which is perfect! Well after the first round we got about 4 more rounds! It was so entertaining the way they do it! We had a blast! The noodles, the soup, the rice, the veggies all so delicious and tasty I had to control myself. Jack was our Hibachi chef and was awesome!! They made us feel so welcomed. My fianc\u00e9 can chug like no other so they kept giving bigger glasses of beer to try to beat him in the sake bomb challenge, they failed!! Super super night definitely be back again and again! I have already recommended this place to so many! I am so glad to have this place so close to my home Southern Highlands. We like to stay close and anything like that is xtreme sushi! We never feel comfortable and welcomed there and they have some good but a lot mediocre. So this will be our regular spot hope they stay because they are so great and in this economy where people are usually staying home it helps if you treat people right, plus I'd be heart broken if the service was bad because the food was so outstanding!! The whole combo works hope they keep it up and last!"

It's also a sushi joint, but that side of the restaurant had a few open tables. The hibachi side was filled. That's impressive considering they had six cooking stations.\n\nThe basic hibachi dinner ($8.95) consists of standard fare -- vegetables, salad, soup, and fried or steamed rice or noodles. I added shrimp ($5.75) and a 5 oz. filet ($7.55) to the mix. The shrimp was pretty good and the filet was cooked medium rare, as ordered, and was tender, as expected.\n\nThe best way to judge any hibachi place, though, is the entertainment factor. Our chef -- an older guy -- was ok. He was friendly enough, but all the tricks he did were the same standard ones you see at any hibachi place -- tossing the egg shell in the hat, the onion volcano, etc. He also tossed shrimp to some of the guests (again, a standard hibachi trick) but only to the guys, which disappointed some of the women at the table.\n\nIf you like hibachi places, you'll like this. If you don't, you probably won't be a fan. While it's similar to many others I've been to, I'd recommend this place for a fun night out whether or not it's with a date or a family."

He went through the motions and while it was all very impressive, he never smiled or laughed or acknowledged us. It was a bit strange.  \n\nThe food was delicious!  We shared the Hibachi combo, with one basic to share, and it was the perfect amount. The scallops were cooked perfectly, as was the steak and shrimp.  I really wanted the oysters on the half shell or oyster shooters, but they didn't have any so ended up getting a \"screaming orgasm\" and that was okay. It was a very small portion compared to other places. \n\nWhen most everyone at our table was done eating, the servers seemed in a rush to get us out, but we wanted to linger and try some dessert and drink more wine. It was a bit uncomfortable. They kept bringing our check and we kept asking for more things so they'd have to take it back. We were the only ones left at the table and I felt bad - I wanted to ask if we could move to a normal table since we weren't ready to leave yet, but the server told us we were fine, even though they kept bringing us our check lol.  \n\nAll in all, the food was great, the service was fast, and it was a great birthday dinner."

I watched this place being built and couldn't wait for the day the doors were open.  My wife and I finally went here for dinner when we had a visitor from Cali.  I would like to think of myself as a sushi purist and typically I don't consider eating hibachi.  Call me stuck up but, I always felt that hibachi was a bit \"touristy\" and more like Japanese for the \"newbie\".  \n\nAnyhow, this visit made me cheat on my first love, sushi.  I loved this place and the prices were super competitive.  We started with sake bombs that were only $2, cheap!  I got the strip steak dinner and it was only about $15 - $16.  The steak and fried rice were delicious.  That week we actually went there 3 times!  \n\nThe staff is super friendly.  Every time we went the chef's were always personable and a little sarcastic, in a good way.  We actually found out that Ohjah means, King of the Ninjas.  Cool!  Also, if you just want to try out there menu a good time to go is during lunch cause the prices are a bit lower.  I would go again and I do recommend going as a group for the hibachi dinner."

The staff is always so accommodating and since we come here quite often they always acknowledge us. \nThe space isn't much to look at from the outside but as my mother always says, it's what's inside that counts!\nThere are 3 types of seating..the Sushi Bar, regular dining off the menu and hibachi dining. We generally always go to hibachi. \nThe menu consists of the usual steak, chicken and shrimp but the also offer Kobe beef, lobster, salmon and scallops. You get your choice of fried rice or noodles and you start with onion soup and ginger salad. The salad dressing they use is amazing and unique. \nWe always each order a steak and split the lobster. Make sure to have them cook with garlic and give you a side of teriyaki sauce for your rice, you won't regret it!  \nWe come here at least once every other month and it still feels like a treat. Can't wait to go back!"

We were warmly greeted by the host and seated immediately in the teppan grill room, which appears to seat about 60-70 at six different stations.  They call it a \"hibachi\" dinner. \n\nIf anyone has ever eaten at Benihana's or the Nijo Castle (Newark, CA), I recall paying about $25-30 per Teppan entree.  Here, you pay $8.95 for the Hibachi basics: soup, salad, rice (steamed or fried) or fried noodles.  Then you choose your add ons or what they call \"mix or match\" which is your proteins.  Chicken teriyaki is $4.95, NY steak is $5.95, filet mignon is $7.55, shrimp $5.75 and so on,  There is also salmon, $5.75 scallops ($7.55),  Lobster tail (6 oz.) for $15.95, Kobe beef $48.95.  They also offer 3 basic entree items (not included is the lobster tail, Kobe beef or Halibut) + the Hibachi basics for $28.95. \n\nI ordered the scallops and chicken, the wife, steak and it is still cheaper than other similar restaurants.  The quality of the food is good. Portions were decent.  The soup was mild in flavor, the salad though was disappointing. The dressing was watery and you could tell the salads were pre-made earlier in the day. \n\nPre-tip for our family of four with 2 kid's hibachi entrees (steak & chicken) with sodas and  a large Sapporo was $76.\n\nThey do offer lunch. sushi, sashimi, nigiri, and a good selection of Japanese entrees in their regular dining room, which has a sushi bar.\n\nWe're hoping this restaurant stands the test of time and continues to flourish at its location since there is no other restaurant like this in the SW part of town,  They also have a location in Pahrump."

Our chef was engaging and entertaining. Sitting with two locals who frequented the place further bolstered our confidence that we made the right choice for dinner...well, they were pretty drunk with multiple sake bombs by the time they started eating so maybe anything will taste good after that. Food turned out to be good and my steak was tender and yummy. Pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food...it wasn't too salty as is the case with most teppan style cooking. A good find!\n\nI guess drunkenness doesn't really dull one's taste buds after all."

I really liked the \"nachos\", which were two deep-fried wonton wrappers with imitation crab and avocado on top. \n\nThe cucumber salad was too salty,  the fried calamari was bland and the sauce it came with tasted like it was watered down.  The sukiyaki was good, but a little too sweet.  I ended up using the cucumbers as a condiment and put slices on top of everything to balance out the flavors."

Nothing great, and very greasy. The kids love the hibachi experience though, so we've gone for a couple of special occasions, because it's a bit pricy for what you get.\n\nChristmas night, we finished family get togethers early, and thought it would be nice to grab a bite to eat. The places that were open were packed, so we eventually found ourselves here. We ate in the regular dining room. I ordered the salmon teriyaki. It was horrible. It tasted very fishy, and was so over cooked, that it was actually a challenge to chew.  Needless to say, I didn't eat it all.\n\nFour hours later, I barely made it to the bathroom, and basically stayed there for the next two days. I was SO sick. My friend who is an ICU nurse had to come over and give me Zofran... This is the only thing that kept me out of the hospital, as I literally could not keep anything in me for a little over 48 hours. Merry Christmas to me! UGH.\n\nDo NOT trust the food here. There's no need to pay for overpriced food, that can possibly send you to the hospital."

We have to go back and try the standard menu.\n\nThe chefs are funny and engaging! Catch a shrimp in your mouth flipped with the spatula right off the grill! I was the only one on our table to try, everyone else just had it flipped on their plate; When in Rome! err Japan?\n\nAs part of the Hibachi grill menu you get: \n1. Onion soup (nice little starter with light onion flavor). \n2. Salad with ginger dressing (warning: they drown the salad in dressing, so maybe ask for it on the side; but I love the dressing so no complaints here)\n3. Sauteed veggies.\n4. Fried rice or noodles.\n5. Your choice of protein. I recommend to spend a little extra and getting the Filet  over  the other steak cuts.  Even though I ordered my NY strip medium, because it was then sliced before plating it kept cooking more and came closer to well done.  The Filet was more tender and ordered medium-rare came to your plate closer to medium but Delicious! I enjoy a good surf & Turf so I also had the calamari which was just ok, Someone in our table ordered lobster and scallops.  The scallops looked amazing so I will try that next time, Lobster looked a little small but what can you expect from a Hibachi grill.\n\nThe rice was flavorful and the veggies were delicious, I love me some mushrooms.  (why was the mushroom invited to the party? Cause he was a Fun-gi!).\n\n \nWe definitely will return. The bill ran about $40-$50 for two. Not bad for a date night (don't worry, it was an impromptu date night, I'm no cheap date giver). The sig-other definitely enjoyed the experience and the food.\n\nDid i like it?

            "review": "There's a teppanyaki area and a regular dining area to eat sushi, Thai dishes, and other non-teppanyaki Japanese dinner entrees. I usually go to the teppanyaki side where you start with a basic hibachi entree which includes onion soup, house salad with ginger dressing, rice (brown, fried, or steamed) OR fried noodles, and veggies (carrots, onions, broccoli, and zucchini) for $8.95. The house salad with ginger dressing is good but the onion soup is a little bland and boring. Then you pick your choice of meat. I went with the NY steak (5 oz) for an additional $7.95. My steak was cooked perfectly. You also get two dipping sauces. The brown sauce is for the meat and the yellow sauce is for your vegetables. The prices are reasonable compared to overpriced Benihana.\n\nNo issues with service from the several times that I have went. I would only come here for the teppanyaki. I ordered the Ohjah Boat (rolls, sushi, and sashimi served on a wooden boat) on a previous visit. The sushi was meh and a bit on the warm side so I will just stick to the teppanyaki here. This is pretty much Benihana's but a lot cheaper where the chefs do their show with the flaming onion volcano, throw an egg in the chef's hat and split it with a spatula trick, & the chef throwing shrimp in your mouth act, etc. I'm not coordinated when it comes to that so I always decline politely. There are a lot of families with kids who like to come here so if you're one of those diners who hate kids, stay away or if you have kids, they would probably enjoy dinner with a show."

            "review": "Like most of the reviews, the Southern Highlands area really needed a good Japanese restaurant as the area is pretty barren for choice.  Luckily Ohjah opened up in the discreet and empty strip mall across from Albertsons.  The first thing I noticed while entering the place with my wife was the Chinese conversation going on between the hostess and a chef.  Being from Hong Kong, it was a bit of a downer considering we were aching for some quality Japanese food, and seeing the place was ran by Chinese, our expectations immediately dropped.  \n    The decor inside is very nice, the lighting is very good, and the staff very polite.  We ordered two lunch sets, the steak teriyaki for myself, and the wife had a steak stir fry.  The waitress tried selling us sushi ( she counted six times throughout our lunch), which seemed ok if we were the least bit interested.  The salad was cold to the point of almost too cold to eat, they need to keep it out of the fridge before serving, but the dressing was decent and could have been worse.  The miso soup is mundane, which probably came in packages you could get at Albertsons or Whole Foods.  The steak teriyaki and stir fry were pretty good, although the tray they brought the food out with smelled of bleach...  Yeah\n\nAll in all, it's a decent place.  We just had too high of expectations, thinking a nice Japanese family was setting up shop, only to see frozen to fryer type food.  The real biter is the price, which makes sure we won't be visiting again.\n\nI want to love this place, because it's so close and it's Japanese, however I can't.  I would say to try it though, it's something different in the Highlands area, and it's at least worth a shot."

They didnt know it was my birthday until the guest on the side of us asked if it was my birthday and then my waiter heard about it and asked me if it was bday?  Next thing you know, the lights dimmed and flickered and a birthday song came on and they also sang Happy Birthday!  The food, the service and the atmosphere is absolutely amazing!

From the delicious soup and unique but delicious salad to incredible cuts of meat this place  rocks! Good luck finding a better filet mignon for anywhere near the price. The sushi has got to be my favorite that I've had. It is quite a bit more expensive than some of the more mainstream sushi spots, but too compare them to places like sushi mon would be an insult. They use super fresh cuts of fish and not even the seaweed has that nasty typical sushi flavor. It's really a demonstration on how sushi SHOULD be done. Another thing to keep in mind is the fact you are getting more than food at this hibachi and the show is always amazing no matter which chef you get. Some are funnier than others, but I enjoy getting a different routine every now and then. If you choose to eat the hibachi I strongly encourage to buy a round of sake bombs! It's a blast for you and your friends and surprisingly smooth. I eat here whenever I have an opportunity and it comes highly recommended. I'm currently trying to convince myself to spend the money and get the Kobe beef! Looks delicious!"

I am a Nigiri Sushi addict. I am a big fan of everything in the refrigerated case in font of me at this sushi bar. So if you ask me what I like, I can just point to the general area of the fish and say \"all of that.\" The only thing that I have found that doesn't blow me away, and this is strictly a personal preference, was the cure on the Saba. Still better than many others though. The daily specials on the board are well worth the price and I have not been anything but satisfied with anything I have ordered from it. I usually order an appetizer, a meal, and whatever fancies me from the specials board and I am happy.\n\nThey have great deals to fit whatever mood you are in.
