            "review": "Wolfgang Puck's Spago is the perfect place to take someone you love or want to impress (e.g. bff, sister, boyfriend, parents, or first date) because the service is impeccable; the food is delicious; and ambiance isn't too uptight but warm and inviting. My food was nicely prepared and presented beautifully. Although, my symphony tuna was not as stellar as I hoped. Drinks were replinished and bread was served numerous times. Our servers were gracious and efficient. I wished I could bring these servers to every restaurant I go to like, say, Ping Pang Pong. But I digress, the meal ended with a nice lemon-blueberry baked Alaska. Which was good except for the measley hard lemon pound cake inside. But that won't stop me from visiting again."

            "review": "I usually eat in the Cafe for lunch - great pizzas, but today I came with my friend and her mom (both great company).  I came hungry (as usual) and was surprised to see how packed the place was considering it was a Tuesday night.  I can't really say much about the appearance of the restaurant except that the dining room reminded me of a modern-style cafeteria.  \n\nI started with ordering a peach bellini made with prosecco.  It was just your standard Bellini, but I did get a sip of my friend's Cosmo, which was sweet and good.  The bread platter arrived shortly after receiving our cocktails.  Breads offered were a cherry walnut, parmesan crisp, sourdough, and caramelized onion foccacia.  I opted for the parmesan crisp and the focaccia.  The foccacia was soft and doughy, it didn't even need any butter!  According to those who had a taste of the cherry walnut, it too was yummy.\n\nOur waiter took a while to take our order, but eventually I was able to get my request in for the English Pea Soup with lemon cream, the duck (split), and halibut (split).  Before our appetizers came out, we were served an amuse of a rich, creamy soup spiced with fennel and lemon.\n\nNext up was our appetizers.  My pea soup tasted like fresh spring peas with a touch of lemon and cream.  Very good.  Also note that all the Wolfgang Puck restaurants serve organic fare whenever possible, definitely a plus.\n\nOur entrees took a while after our appetizers were cleared, which was a little lame since we were starving.  But finally they arrived!  The duck was awesome, done rare served with a L'orange rhubarb sauce, semolina fondue, ciopollini, trumpet mushrooms, peas and turnips.  The halibut, with sauce rouille, was a little overdone and lacked flavor, but the seafood risotto on which it was served on was really good.  \n\nLastly dessert.  We split the creme brulee and the chocolate dessert.  The brulee was not the usual (served in a ramekin and torched).  Instead it consisted of a custard atop a layer of phyllo dough and a sugar crisp.  Kudos for the attempt to deconstruct creme brulee, but I think I would have rather had a more traditional version.  The chocolate desert was served with a chocolate espresso ice cream which was melted by the time we were served, however it was still pretty good.  I didn't care too much for the moussey chocolate desert, but my friend ate it all, so I guess to each their own.\n\nAll in all, Spago has pretty good food.  The reason for my 3 stars?  Service and timing was off.  Also some of the dishes could have been executed a little better.  Not too shabby though.\n\nImportant:  Beware of the first and last step respectively to and from the bathroom.  I think I may have seen about 5 people eat concrete on the steps within the two hour time period I was there."

The server was right, it was life changing (for someone with a shallow life lol). It was so delicious and tasted fresh. The pasta was freshly made. Shrimp didn't come from the freezer. Sauces weren't as heavy. \n\nService was great. They were sincere and not overly friendly."

I was fooled by the dinner menu, and decided to jump in right away when I saw John Dory on the menu.  I was mistaken and a bit disappointed.  John Dory was only on the dinner menu and not the lunch menu.  Wasn't disappointed for long.  I order the prosciutto wrapped meatloaf.  It was the best meatloaf I've ever had.  Everything else was ordered was ok, but the meatloaf blew me away.  I'd like to go back for dinner one day and order the john dory."

            "review": "We came here before watching Mariah Carey and had a truly wonderful experience. We had a fairly big group (9 people) but we didn't have to wait at all (we had a reservation) and our service was impeccable throughout the entire dinner.  The food was fantastic as well! I got the filet mignon and nibbled on the truffle spaghetti. The truffle spaghetti was soooo good. I loooooved the flavor and wish I had got that myself. I also nibbled on the sea bass and that was perfectly cooked and really good. The majority of my group got the special of the night, which was a spicy tomato sauce pasta with lobster and seafood. Everyone said it was delicious and practically were licking their plates. We also ordered the seafood platter as an appetizer and another appetizer I can't recall. For dessert we had the apple cobbler and salted caramel souffl\u00e9 and both were great. \n\nMy only complaint is that I ordered the filet medium and it practically came out alive that's how rare it was. For $60 a steak I was expecting it to be perfect so I had them cook it longer and when they sent it back it it came back still a little less than medium rare, which I just can't eat. So I sent it back again hoping third times the charm. This time it came back medium but by the time it came back everyone in my group had already finished their food. I'm a slow eater so I felt a little anxious and tried to eat as fast as possible. However, they comped my meal, that's how amazing the service was! And when the steak was cooked medium it was really good. Not as good as Mastro's but still good. \n\nThis is a great restaurant if you'd like something a little upscale while in Vegas. It's perfect to eat here if you are watching a show at Caesars. The food and service can't be beat!"

We sat in the back dining room instead of the \"patio\" so we could talk and not stare at all the tourists. \n\nOur meal was really delightful. The service was great. All was top noth. So, why only 3 stars?\n\nI noticed when we sat down there was little specs of debris on the table. Then it was in my water, not once, but a few times. I was puzzled until I looked up. The air vents in the ceiling were extremely dirty. The debris on the table and in my water was from this vent. \n\nSpoke to the manager, but he did not seem to interested in the issue.\n\nAs side from that issue, I would return."

It was a wonderful setting for a nice evening out.\n\nI opted for the Oysters on the Half Shell ($22 for half dozen). The selection was Pickling Pass Oysters served with Red Wine Ginger Mignonette. The oysters and mignonette were great, but unfortunately had broken-off shell bits everywhere.\n\nWe also shared the Cheese Plate ($25):\nFlora Nelle Organic Blue Cheese: Organic cows milk, aged 6 months\nT\u00eate de Moine: Triple cream cow's milk, aged 2 weeks; Burgundy, France\nBrillat Savarin: Semi-soft part skim cheese; AOC, Switzerland \nChimay \u00e0 la Bi\u00e9re Trappiste: Pasteurized cow's milk, semi-soft, washed with beer; Belgium\nPyrennes Pilota Vach-Brebis: Aged 3 months, pasteurized sheep's milk; Aquitaine, France\n\nThe cheese was served with Cherry Walnut Bread, candied walnuts, raisins, apples, and honey. Everything was really nice. I enjoyed all the cheeses, especially the T\u00eate de Moine and Brillat Savarin (one of my favorites).\n\nFor beverages, I had a Moscow Mule ($12): Russian Standard vodka, lime juice, Fever-Tree ginger beer and my BFF had the Shogun ($15): Yamasaki 12-year, Cocchi Americano, Honey Yuzu tea, and lemon juice. Both selections were great."

Started us off with a nice basket of assorted breads and biscuits. The variety was a nice touch. We had cocktails, a Margherita pizza, filet mignon (don't remember what my date had), and dessert. This place is very quiet, mellow, and intimate.\n\nEverything was well prepared and it was a great presentation. Really no complaints. This place is for individuals who fine dine regularly... what I mean is, this isn't a place where you're going to get some crazy table-side culinary show or what not. Here you will be paying for the name, quality of food, and privacy."

It was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of fresh mozzarella cheese.  Highly recommend it!  Was disappointed that they don't post the prices on their menu out front, so if you want to know prices before you take a seat, just ask.  Pizzas ranged from$14 to $29.  The $29 was for salmon."

            "review": "Spago has been credited for starting the fine dining trend in Vegas. This is probably my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. I've been here several times now, and I've never had a bad meal here. I love that you have the option of sitting in the 'patio area' and enjoying their more casual 'cafe' menu or sitting in the dining room and enjoying the regular Spago restaurant. Both are great options with their own pros.\n\nThe patio area is FANTASTIC for people watching. The menu is always changing, and the food is always great. The wood fire pizzas are always a great choice. They're perfect for sharing between 2 people. The fried calamari is also very delicious. The service is wonderful., and they also have one of the yummiest bread baskets ever! \n\nThe menu for the dining room is pricier and fancier. The food and ambiance is great.  It is much quieter than the patio; perfect for special occasions! The dishes are very innovative and delicious. This menu changes daily. I haven't seen the same menu twice. I believe they also offer a tasting menu in the dining room for the foodies who want to thoroughly experience all that Spago has to offer.\n\nThe desserts here are WONDERFUL. Kudos to the pastry chef! Definitely save room for dessert when dining at Spago. Last time I was there I had the Lemon-Blueberry baked Alaska. It was amazing! I loved the flavors!  Also, while all the dishes on the regular menu are prepared with peanut oil, many of the dessert menus are not. I came here with a friend with a peanut allergy, and instead of ordering a real meal, she just went to town with the dessert menu :)"

Portions were on the small size but with the free bread (5 types to choose from), I was full by the end of the meal.\n- To save money I planned on not getting a drink (just their free \"ice water\") then I noticed a Bud Light was $6 but the house-made Sangria was $7, so I ordered a tasty Sangria.\n- My server (Charlotte?) was attentive and so were the free bread server & ice water refiller.\n- That night (11 Dec) Wolfgang Puck was there to receive praise/speeches from Caesars(?) executives & receive a key to the city/slot machines (I think that was the joke the mayor was making) from Mayor Carolyn Goodman.  He also took photos with interested patrons/diners.  Seems like a great, affable guy.\n- I would love to come back to Spago but alas I can't swing the normal menu prices."

I seriously wonder how knowledgeable people are about pizza when they state that the pizza here was \"fantastic.\"  I ate here two days ago and like most people ordering for lunch that day, I had a pizza.  I ordered the Italian Sausage pizza with roaster fennel, tuscan olives, reggiano cheese and thyme.\n\nThis pizza tasted just like pizzas I have had at California Pizza Kitchen except theirs were better.  My pizza at Spago had onions on it- the description on the menu did not say it came with onions.  Quite frankly, the combination just did not work.  The onions and olives overpowered the flavor of the sausage, which was pretty tasty once it was off the pizza.  The reggiano cheese also did not work for me.\n\nWhen I am paying over $15 for a pizza, I expect better.  This is the second time I've been disappointed with a Wolfgang Puck restaurant.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be sure to skip his restaurants."

            "review": "We all know how far Wolfgang Puck's stock has dropped since he was the \"inventor\" of California Pizza. He's a Celebrity Chef dinosaur now, and when you consider how far divorced its creator is from his sensational fame,  it's a bit strange that this Spago has survived in Vegas as long as it has -- whole casinos have risen and fallen during its life.\n\nThis is not true if you actually dine here.  This is _not_  a Wolfgang Puck Bistro/Express/Coffee shop, as other Strip properties (and shopping malls from Oxnard to Peoria) sometimes host.  It's an approximation of Spago, which was once one of the hottest tickets in LA.  \n\nThe food was once pioneering stuff, and so over the years Puck's many imitators have surpassed him, but it doesn't mean the food here is any less solid.  The menus are not huge, vary (somewhat) by season, and are fairly devoid of clunkers.   You may not rave about it after, some 25 years after Spago was chic, but you probably won't leave disappointed.\n\nLike many simulated al fresco dining options in Casinos, this Spago has a dynamite location, near one of the Forum's fountains.  For that extra je ne sais quoi of kitsch value, try to wrangle the \"Showgirls\" table \"outside,\" the very site of Cristal and Nomi bonding over their shared redneck past and the fine flavor of dog food."

It was our last night in Vegas and we wanted to try one of the very good restaurants since we hadn't spent much money at all on food that week (the convention provided most of what we needed).  So we went for the full Spago Experience.  (Kids, don't try this at home).\n\nSo let me start with the food.   Every morsel of food that entered my mouth was stunning.  Nothing lacked seasoning.  Everything was exciting and brilliant in flavor.   We obediently listened to our lovely waitress and went with their \"1/2/3\" concept - the idea being that you choose one offering from each of the 3 sections on the menu - the first being a very small plate, the 2nd slightly larger  and the 3rd - the entree.    I chose:  1. Prime Beef Tartare w/\nCapers, Quail Egg, Dijon Aioli, Horseradish,  2. Raviolo w/ House Made Ricotta, Organic Egg, Hazelnut-Brown Butter ,  3. Pan Seared Sonoma Duck Breast w/ Semolina Fondue, Breakfast Radish, Heirloom Carrots, Maitake Mushrooms, Honey Gastrique.  We also ordered a bottle of Sangiovese from Spago's excellent wine list.  One of those wine lists that simply does not have a bad choice on it.  \n\nBeef Tartare - Total umami bomb.  Perfectly seasoned.  Very fresh.  I could have eaten a whole bowl of it and left the place happy.  Was served with paper thin slices of their excellent house-made baguette, lightly toasted.  This dish was an amazing start. \nBread - They brought bread to the table and asked which of the 5 types of house-made bread we'd like.  I couldn't decide, so he gave me two (and even more later, argh!)  in the end, between my colleague and I  - we were able to split and taste all the breads they had to offer.  There was a black wheat bread with cranberries, their excellent baguette, an olive/rosemary dinner roll, some kind of lightly cheesed focacia...and the last, I fail to recall.  But wow.  When he came back later and asked if we wanted more (with a conspiratorial wink), neither of us could refused even thought we knew it would result in our being overstuffed when we left the place (it did!).\nRaviolo - So simple, so perfectly executed, so warm.....one big perfect pillow of house made pasta filled with ricotta and a gorgeous , unbroken (bright orange!) egg yolk that burst when you cut into the raviolo and ran all over the plate.  Then add that simple hazelnut beurre noisette...I'll be dreaming of this dish for weeks to come.\nDuck - Perfectly seared. Medium rare as requested.  Gorgeous vegetables and that gastrique - made with honey and plum wedges - was just right.   I could have laid right down on the floor of Spago at that moment, slept a painless sleep with marvelous dreams - but dessert awaited...\nThe coffee was rich and robust.   The apple crisp with house made vanilla bean ice cream was warm, with marvelous granola-like crunchy bits.  Just enough to tip me over the edge and realize that I had, indeed, over-indulged with no regrets.  And after we requested the check - another small plate was delivered with a pair of truffles for each of us.  Marvelous.  And yes, we ate them.\n\nThe Service was what I had always striven for, in my personal pursuits as a waiter back in the day.  Friendly, warm, helpful, elegant (but never stuffy) and with an almost undetectable emphasis on selling.  You never felt pressured, never felt uncomfortable.  You always felt well attended to and special.  We were visited by the Maitre De on at least 4 occasions and he was charming, helpful (to both us and the wait staff, who was very busy that night) and very accommodating.  He opened and served our wine with the polish of a seasoned sommelier and made it clear that he was there for us for the long haul.  Whatever we needed, we need only ask.   Our head waitress treated us like family - she was like that favorite cousin that you don't get to see often enough - friendly, fun, smart, articulate and engaging.  She always spent just enough time at the table and had perfect command of the menu and specials.  We literally missed her when she left.   The rest of the staff - from the guy who served the bread and replaced your sliverware to the guy pouring water and kitchen waiters delivering the food - everyone did so with perfect polish, friendly smiles and a willingness to help further as needed.   This sfaff SPARKLED!    Yes, I'm gushing, but they were *that* good.  Even the chef stopped by.\n\nSo - in the end, I have no complaints.   No regrets whatsoever.   But I would like to point out that the price range in yelp is by no means accurate.   Granted, we did get a bottle of wine ($40) and dessert ($12-ish).  But if you go with the Spago 1/2/3 concept (and you should!), you're already far beyond the listed $31-60 price range.   If you chose the 3 least expensive items in each section, you'll be paying approximately $60 each on food alone.  Yelp needs to update.  Still - no regrets.  :)  Well worth the $$$$ spent."

I have never had a bad meal there. Ever. My DH took me there for a special dinner our first trip to Vegas together years and years and years ago. Yes, years. Three of them, which is really like probably 12. So each \"years\" really means 4 years, got it? Good, stop exhausting me with your questions.  Nowadays, we always sit at the bar. This particular time, we both were in the mood for burgers, and they were burgerfection.  Niman Ranch burgers on a French roll, with gruyere cheese and caramelized onions...we ordered side salads instead of pommes frites and they were lovingly and lightly dressed.  Even though the restaurant was PACKED and the bartender seemed a little harried, he made sure we had what we needed in a timely manner and when all the people from the fly over states left he wiped his brow and became a little more personable. They seemed a little understaffed that day, usually not a problem.\n\nThe. Perfect. Vegas. Lunch."

The bar is solid, i love being able to walk in without a reservation, sit down, and order a great pizza or dish of mussels for a very fair price.  Great people watching too, Vegas brings in every type of person from every type of country, and that's as good a show as anything i have paid to see!.\n\nGo to Spago when you want to try something new. I have read reviews here of people being dissappointed about pasta dishes and other common every day fare. My memorable dishes have been tuna tartar in a crispy wanton shell, lobster salad served on an Asian soup spoon, pan fried sardine over a citrus vinaigrette slaw ( which was mind blowing!) Some awesome mains i have had have been duck breast with cauliflower puree and root veg, where the fat was rendered off and made the meat ridiculously delicious and the skin crispy and perfect.  \n\nI write this on my latest trip to Vegas and eagerly anticipate my new visit on Thursday night!"

I'm really not sure what happened, but after we order, Michael our waiter stopped coming by our table. Our theory is he wanted to get a bigger tip from the large tables coming in. By the end of the night, I wasn't sure who was waiting on our table anymore, there were so many different people coming to and from or table. Also, I ordered a second round of mojitos when our meals came out, and they didn't come out until after we finished eating. We did get the mojitos on the house but were not happy with no drink during my meal.\n\nOverall, I was not happy. The bill for four came to almost $270.

The food is outstanding and the service is always excellent. You can't go wrong with a pizza and the chopped salad. The pastas are delicious too as are the tuna cones. It's fun sitting on the \"patio\" people watching in the Forum shops or at the bar chatting with the staff. Don't miss it! Great for a date or a larger group too - just make sure to grab a reservation for peak times."

We had oysters on the half shell for an appetizer, I think pasta for our meal and some dessert. The dessert sounded so appetizing on the menu but I was very disappointed. The food was over priced and had no flavor.  It made me sick to pay for my meal when I did not enjoy any of it. I just kept thinking this is such a waste of money."

While I am not thrilled about going to Forum Shops, I have always wanted to check this place out, so here I am.  The patio looked a bit too *lively* for my taste, so I asked to be seated in the dining room.  I must have come on \"mom takes her 2 daughters out\" day because there were literally 3 sets in my elevated dining room section.  There were many sets of tourist as well.  I enjoyed that the atmosphere of this place it is classy yet accessible.\n\nAs soon as I was seated, I was asked what I would like to drink.  This time my water was kept on a silver platter on my table.  Nice touch, but I would have preferred it kept on ice. (I know. I'm spoiled.)  In fact, they weren't too on top of the \"let me refill it for you\" thing.  When my waiter made his way to my table, I asked him if they had a Thanksgiving special.  They did, and he gave me a very informative description of the courses.  I told him I would take it.  He offered it a la cart instead of the full menu.  I had to assure him that I wanted the full menu.\n\nThe Butternut Quash Soup with Cranberry Quince-Apple Chutney, Candied Walnuts,Cardamom Cream and Pumpkin Seed Oil  was amazing.  Never have had that dish before, but it really did taste like Thanksgiving.  The bread course was certainly one of the best that I've had.  The main course was Roasted Free Range Turkey Roulade with Pretzel Bread Stuffing Knodel, Green Bean Casserole, Sweet Potato Puree with Brown Sugar, Yellowfin Mash Potato, Cranberry-Apple Chutney, Bay-Leave and Clove Turkey Au Jus.  I cleared my plate.  In fact my waiter came back by and saw it, smiled, and said, \"Wow. Good Job.\"  It really made me feel a whole lot better... then I began to think that this was one of the best dinners I have had.  I was thankful that even though it was impossible to go home to family, it was not impossible to enjoy a wonderful dinner.  I had espresso and perused the dessert menu but nothing caught my eye.\n\nAll in all, this was one of the best dining experiences I have had in Vegas... I really wish that there was something remotely comparable off of the Strip.  In fact, I plan on returning to see if this was a fluke or if this place is the real deal."

Where else can you get an expertly wood-fired pizza that could feed 2 people for a little over 10 bucks?  And it is freakin Wolfgang Puck...he doesn't put his name on crap.  Unless he is selling actual crap and it would be called Wolfgang Puck's crap.  I guarantee it would be the best crap money could buy.  It is freakin Wolfgang Puck.  Trust me.

None of the items were even remotely boring(as per server's tip). The food was delicious. The way they make their salads makes me wanna eat salad every day. Precise cuts of vegetables with unique seasonings, herbs or sauces melt my salad heart and crunchy nuts or noodles make it want to jump. I try to deconstruct the flavors every single time, thinking I will make the same thing at home. Their textures are crunchy and delicious. The fish was soft and buttery.\n\nService- amazing, funny and helpful lady server, and a sweet, gallant bus boy.\n\nWolfgang Puck is my hero!"

So you can tell, I was feeling something big and beefy which probably colored my menu selections a bit. Enough about me, more about Spago. Note they have 2 different menus depending on where you sit (cafe and dining room). We sat in the dining room. \n\nGroup of 3 of us arrived at about 7:30 on a Thursday, no wait at all (kind of atypical in Vegas!). We sat down, were served super promptly, and got  an amuse bouche of potato leek soup brought out right away. Awesome. They have a couple gin oddities on their bar, so I got a gin martini. Almost lost some points since the waiter asked if I wanted a lime in it (that would be a gimlet, not a martini). But whatevs. The martini was done very well...it had a remarkable floral scent to it quite a treat...try the cape rock organic gin. It was also $14, but that seems more the norm than the exception in Vegas.  \n\nI had the most elegantly presented heirloom tomato soup in the entire world.  The waiter brought a covered bowl to my table, lifted the top off, and there was a beautiful dense red soup with a pine branch drawn into the top of the soup using a olive oil/basil sauce. Stunning. And the soup was great too...the crouton served with it matched perfectly. Very very well done here.\n\nSince I was in a meaty/grilly mood (expecting to head to a Flay joint), I got the kobe flat iron steak. It was also exceptional. The steak was perfectly well done, nice and chewy (its a flatiron people, it should be chewy), but not tough at all. It was served with some broccolini which fit this dish perfectly. I'm only sorry I was too full for dessert.  \n\nThey brought out an assortment of bread in a basket before the appetizers, and I was having a tough time choosing between them since they all sounded great. After I made a tough choice for the bread I had selected, the waiter asked if I wanted something else. It was perfect - I was able to sample all of the breads that sounded great to me. He also came back 2-3 times during the meal to see if we wanted any more. Also, our water glasses never got below 1/3 full. Its weird, I've always wondered why the mid-high end restuarants typically don't have this kind of service, when you are clearly going to pay a fair chunck of change for dinner. Its awesome to see a place that really aims to please you in every way possible. Also, the wait staff was generally transparent during the meal even though they were doing a lot of work clearing our table, customizing cutlery, filling water, etc.\n\nThe dining area is perfectly decorated. Its a little trendy, but not blinking red light and technoey. The decor is so right because you can walk in there wearing anything (ahem...within reason) and not feel out of place. Its great for any age group - 20ish to 60ish. Its a little loud, but not disruptivley so. You are going to have to pay a bit for this place (app, dinner, and a single martini ran me $100 after tip), but I'd do it again on my own dime in a heartbeat.\n\nIts one of those rare 5 star places. Well done sir Puck."

            "review": "Summary:  Spago is a great place to take a significant other.  The noise level in the cafe was not too loud which made it an enjoyable experience.  Although unnerving while watching you dine, the wait staff does a great job of answering questions and clearing dishes from the table.  The pizzas are highly recommended but be willing to shell out some money for the drinks, cocktails and wines being the most unreasonably priced.\n\nI went to Spago on New Year's Eve with my girlfriend.  Fortunately I made reservations the week before.  Our reservation was for 7:15 but I showed up a little early and was seated by 7:05.  There are two menus you can choose from; the cafe menu of the dining room menu.  The dining room menu has your meats and fine dining while the cafe menu has brick oven pizzas ad the like.  We opted for the cafe menu and ordered drinks, an appetizer, and our main meal all at once.  Unfortunately they all came out at the same time (very quickly, about 20 minutes after ordering) so our pizzas got cool while we ate our calamari.\n\nThe cafe, although mostly open to the Forum Shops street mall, was not as loud as you might expect.  Conversation was easily audible.  The wait staff was friendly and had no trouble answering any of the questions I had about the menu.  It is a little unnerving however since the wait staff lines along the side wall when they are not helping diners, observing the dining room and seeing if any diners need them.  They just stand there...looking...watching....constantly vigilant.  That aside, they do great at being Johnny on the spot for clearing dishes and helping with questing.\n\nThe calamari served with their sweet chili sauce was fantastic.  The chicken sausage pizza was equally fantastic and was a fairly large portion that I almost did not finish because it made me full.  The drink prices were the most unreasonable and unpleasant thing I encountered at Spago.  Soda is $4.50 and the cocktails range from $10-17.  I ordered a Vesper and it was $16, where a fair price could have been $9 or $10."

In fact, in a lot of ways, it's pretty much an entirely different restaurant - food quality, menu, atmosphere, decor, etc. However, that said, Spago Vegas is still a great place. (Just don't think you've been to THE Spago because you went to Spago Vegas.)\n\nFor me, I prefer Spago Vegas as a lunch spot and like to sit on the patio or at the bar, as opposed to in the main dining room.\n\nOddly enough, my favorite thing here is actually the wings. Yep, the wings. They're these little drummettes that are just absolutely heavenly. Just the right amount of spice and vinegar. And a scrumptious blue cheese sauce for dipping.\n\nOk, and the pizzas, pastas, and salads are great too. And ok, pretty much everything else is good too. And the cocktails are excellent. I am big fan of the pineapple mojito.\n\nAnd the best part is that locals get 20% off their entire check. Huge props for that. (This locals offer holds true for most of Wolfgang Puck's restaurants in Vegas.)"

The sweet chili sauce it comes with is delicious and the cucumber salad that it comes with is delicious!! Though I get it every time, there is one thing I would change about it. I would use seasoned breadcrumbs!! If the breadcrumbs they use are seasoned, you really cannot tell at all. I know the sauce is supposed to provide the flavor but the calamari just needs a little kick. \n\nOther items that I have tried that are very good are the black truffle fettucine, roasted organic chicken, spaghetti, chicken parm sandwich, asian chicken salad - they were all good and I would recommend any of those items!!\n\nAnd my favorite thing - the olive oil that they give in addition to sea salt and butter for the bread bowl. This olive oil is amazing!! It's very potent and has an intense flavor that I can't really describe but I end up dipping my chicken in it, french fries, calamari, potatoes, i will put that olive oil on anything!!!\n\nThe ambiance of this place is average.

It was deceivingly simple: cabbage, bean sprouts, carrots, sesames, cashews, pea shoots, radicchio, chicken...none of the ingredients were out of this world but somehow with the magic that is Wolfgang Puck and his powerhouse of restaurant awesomeness I found myself wanting to lick the bowl clean. Why? Because the chicken wasn't just chicken - it was so perfectly cooked: tender, moist, delicious. The cashews had a delightful crispiness with a spicy seasoning. All the veggies were cut so beautifully so that I could get a forkful of everything all combining with the perfect textures and flavors. And the dressing...oh that dressing....can I bathe in it? Would that be unsanitary? Because honestly, dress me up and down in that ginger vinaigrette and call me dirty. I'll be ok with that. \n\nAside from the salad we also shared the lamb chorizo pizza and skirt steak quesadilla. No words. The pizza was beautiful - nice light crust with a slight char on it to give it that smoky flavor. All combined with a tangy goat cheese, sweet sundried tomatoes and...oh dear...here comes another wave of tingling tastebuds....\n\nSuffice to say it was all delicious.If you want to see their current menu:\nhttp://www.wolfgangpuck.com/content/files/foodmenu_SLV%20Lunch%20revised.pdf\n\nAnd yes, as others have said, the breadbasket was yum.

You won't have to wait...We came at lunch, got seated immediately and had the best service.  They knew before I knew that our soda had to get refilled bringing out a fresh glass of soda to replace the dwindling one. \n\nAll in all - yes yes yes!! And side note - for $2 you can go to Tix4Tonight (several locations throughout the strip) to get a discount (something like 10% off your meal). It didn't make a huge dent in our bill (saved us something like $5) but if you're doing dinner or a big lunch then definitely get that.\n\nAnd if anyone knows where I can take Spago Thai Vinaigrette showers please message me.

Selection was not bad, but I didn't know what to choose. I ended up with the grilled salmon. I was really scared that it would end up really disgustingly gross like the salmon I had at Vert (in Hollywood.. also a Wolfgang Puck place), but I was quite surprised. It was similar to the salmon I had at the Venetian, but this one was grilled a little longer. Not perfect, but went great with my wine (a chardonnay). The crab cake appetizer was good too, and according to others in my party, the paella got a little salty in the end. The choices of bread given before your meal were quite tasty, foccaccia, some flat bread thing, walnut bread, and a raisin type bread. I really liked the flat bread thing; it had some nice zing to its taste.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, it was definitely loud (we were a party of 7, and near us were parties of 10 and 5), the decor was a little too contemporary/modern for my taste. Fair amount of younger people, probably eating before heading to Pure.\n\nOur server was not bad, a little difficult to find when we were actually ready to order. They gave us two glasses of sprite when we ordered one, but luckily they didn't charge for that. We really had minimal interaction with our waiter, but at least he was nice when he came by (that's what waiters are supposed to be anyway right).\n\nOverall.. not too bad.. but now that I think about it, kind of overrated. 3 1/2 stars in my book."

It had wonderful reviews and we were close by, so we shot on over. We noticed it was semi late and asked one of the men resetting a table if they were closed and he let us know that they were open and hour longer. No big deal since we're the \"get in and get out\" type. We then make our way to the hostess we ask to be seated. This woman, with short black hair, gives us the up and down look and explains that they will not take us due to some last minute seating policy arrangement. The entire back room was empty and ready for customers. She just thought we weren't dressed well enough for the establishment. I have never had such judgement passed on me. I mean I can't eat at your fancy place because of what I look like. Talk about shallow. I understand there are dresscodes for such things but mind you were weren't wearing anything horrific. I was wearing a floor length vintage gown and my guy some slacks and button down. Surely good enough to spend money right? \n\nAnyway, I was abhorred with their customer service and I made it a point to yelp them when I had the time. \n\nThanks, but no thanks. \n\n-The \"ugly\" one"

Great conversation where we learned not only about the food we were eating and the wines we were drinking but the history of where it came from and why it was so special.  Little clever plays on the traditional to make something unique.  The corn soup....is it appropriate to lick your bowl?  Just asking... Ultimately, it comes down to the experience, connection, and true heart and these wonderful men have it down to a science.  And you have GOT to try the Old Fashioned - out of this world.

There was a prixe fix lunch option available, but we decided to stick with the original lunch menu. \n\n- Waiter brought out a bread basket with four different types of bread that you can choose from. Bread is accompanied with bell pepper/cheese spread. Their rosemary bread is so good (fluffy, warm, and full of flavor). \n\n- Chicken Salad Sandwich: On walnut and cherry bread with grapes, alfalfa sprouts, and watercress salad accompanied with a side of kettle cooked colorful chips. The bread was toasted (That's always a plus!) and I really liked the addition of grapes in my chicken salad (grapes in my salad were delicious too). \n\n- Chicken Sausage Pizza: Two cheeses, barbeque sauce, caramelized corn (Lacking, I only saw a few kernels here and there), roasted pasilla peppers, and oregano. This pizza was on a bit too sweet for me and I think it would have been better if they added more corn. \n\nOverall, service was attentive and our waitress was very friendly. No wait time, which was a definite plus and food came out rather quickly. i would recommend this place and would come back to try their dinner menu. \n\nP.S.

This comes with an experienced staff which I think they lack.\n\nThe food was very good but I didn't walk out saying that was worth the money I just spent for the experience.

Starting with an assortment of bread with sauces, salts and spices and a wonderful bottle of wine to match (Brunello di Montapalcino). Each entree was cooked to perfection with each ingredient complimenting each other. We ended the night with an array of desserts with the assorted cookie plate, warm apple potpie and the banana bread pudding.

We ordered the \"seafood platter\" as a starter, but unfortunately, they were out of lobster, which is basically the best part!  For entrees, some ordered the surf and turf, which turned out to be mediocre good; less than expected.  I had the pasta special which I chose the option to have crabmeat with it was satisfying, but not sure I'd order it again.

With the attractive al fresco dining option albeit indoors with artificial skyline and people watching galore, we opted for cafe seating.

Foodgasm guaranteed!\n\nNow onto the entrees:\n\nSpaghettini with a side of roasted chicken - I've been on a scratch made pasta kick lately, so when I had heard they rolled out fresh pasta daily, I was instantly sold!  There's a difference in the texture, flavor and overall mouthfeel of the pasta! If you haven't had it fresh I strongly advise you try a plate of the spaghettini here. It's phenomenal! Each strand was coursing with a vibrant red sauce which lent its wonderful aroma from the fresh basil. The richness of the sauce and marked acidity came from the ropa vieja tomatoes, which rounded out the flavor profiles of this winning dish perfectly.\nAnd the chicken? Tender and juicy with an irresistibly crispy skin that I devoured in a flash!\n\nLamb Chorizo Pizza with rapini, sundries tomatoes, goat cheese and cilantro -  Now this was my kinda pizza pie! It was nice and thin but definitely not lacking in the flavor department by any means. The lamb chorizo was savory and well seasoned and the crunchy rapini added a pleasant  contrast in texture. The chopped cilantro and fresh tomato brightened up the dish and definitely took this droolworthy pizza to another level of deliciousness! \n\nService was prompt and friendly. Our waters were always filled and staff constantly stopped by to see how we were doing, which was nice for a bustling cafe. We enjoyed an elegant meal that was quick, unfussy and delicious!\n\nOverall, I was quite pleased with my experience here and it goes without saying I'd  definitely come back.  Hopefully with time to spare on my next visit, ill give the main dining room a whirl.\n\nUntil then,\n\nHappy Eats!"

Prior to Spago, nearly every hotel boasted about it's all you can eat prime rib and shrimp buffets.  Spago, when it opened in 91 or 92 (can't remember) transitioned Vegas from a quantity to a quality town.  So for those of you that have eaten at Joel Robuchon, Alex, Picasso, or any other casual/fine dining establishment, thank Spago.\n\nOkay, onto the actual review.\n\nMy mom and I started off with fried calamari.  The calamari rings were fried to perfection, no greasiness whatsoever.  The rings were crunchy on the outside, yet moist and tender within.\n\nFor my entree, the I had the braised beef short ribs, and my mom had the seafood risotto.  Both entrees were excellent, the short ribs I had were tender as expected and extremely flavorful.  My mom's risotto was also delicious.  It had the starchy consistency you'd expect from a risotto, yet the rice was still a perfect al dente.  There was also a medley of seafood to accompany her dish, too, which she thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nTaking my mom out, if she enjoys the place, so do I.\n\n****"

I have to say it was DELICIOUS!!! The menu that is on the site is very different then what was presented at the table (I'm thinking maybe because it is summer time and menu selections change depending on the season and chef?). Speaking of Chefs, Erik (the chef that evening) came out and offered to make a special dish for a few people at our table. They ordered a fabulous medium rare meat dish that was prepared in the brick oven. It looked almost like a prime rib (without the bone). I ordered the flank steak that had a wonderful butter garlic sauce over it. Everything from the grilled fish to the pasta dish looked very appetizing! We started with the calamari appetizer, sashimi, and this other prosciutto dish that had a creamy white cheese spread, very similar to a melted mozzarella. This was a great dining experience and I was very pleasantly surprised by the food and service. I will definitely be returning and recommending this place to friends and family that come visit!"

I view it as a bit out of price range, so when their 20 Year Anniversary came up with roll-back pricing, I had to try it.  Went last night with my date, and we asked the assistant GM Drew to pick our food.  Here's what he picked, and my thoughts on each:\n\nSignature Roasted Beet Goat Cheese Salad\nI never would have ordered this but it was delicious.\n\nHouse Smoked Sturgeon, Crisp Potato Galette, Horseradish Cream - $12\nIt was like a spicy latke with fish on top.  Really good.\n\n\n\"Chinois Style\" Colorado Lamb Chops, Cilantro Mint Vinaigrette, Sweet & Sour Eggplant - $33\nTender and delicious even without the sauce.  Eggplant was so good my date and I couldn't figure out if it was eggplant!\n\nCantonese Style Roasted Duck with Wild Huckleberries, Ginger and Stir-Fried Baby Bok Choy - $20\nHuge and delicious, and unexpected as we thought we were only getting 1 main course to share.  Needless to say we had plenty of leftovers.\n\nEven with the discount I spent a bit more than I had hoped, but everything was delicious and the service was great, as well.  Oh, and they have an amazing bread platter.  Wish I was hungrier and got to try more of that!\n\nThanks, Drew W & Scott G!"

The seven course tasting menu is technically an eight course if you include the amuse bouche. \n\nKerry was our server and she is impeccable as always. Her standard of service is top notch from the way she works the table to how personable she got with all of us. A group of 14 of us came in to dine and large parties are not easy to work, but her team worked flawlessly well together. \n\nThe food is more than enough to satisfy even the most hungry. I came in with an empty stomach and was ready to roll on out. I was uncomfortable for the rest of the night, but that was my fault for devouring my meal and then moving on to those who couldn't finish theirs. I am greedy when it comes to good food. I won't be fighting you over it, but I will not be letting it go to waste. \n\nAs with any good tasting, it evolves and to speak too much into the food will only leave you disappointed if they do not have it anymore. I will say the corn agnolotti with the shaved truffles was one of the star dishes. I could eat these everyday. \n\nI am not the most knowledgeable about wines, but I felt comfortable in asking for assistance. The bottles here are affordable especially for the Strip. \n\nGreat experience!"

This is the kind of food I love to eat. Fresh, clean flavors, where you don't leave feeling like you inhaled grease for two hours. The service is impeccable, and the entire waitstaff is knowledgeable, friendly, and efficient. The wine list is superb, and we were never dissatisfied with our waiter-recommended wine selections.\n\nThroughout the two dinners we ate here, we tried the artichoke soup, the variation of beets, the chilled maine lobster salad, the raviolo, roasted chicken, sea bass, dover sole, filet, lamb, and the duck. Can you tell we loved the food? Everything was perfection. There wasn't one single dish that met with a mediocre response from anyone. The artichoke soup was absolutely to die for and was perfectly creamy without being too decadent. The beets were out of this world as well, and I could eat them every day. I had the sole and sea bass, and they were both delicate and melt-in-your-mouth with just the perfect amount of crunchy, silky vegetables underneath.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the chocolate cremieux, the peanut butter souffl\u00e9, and one of the special desserts on evening, a strawberry consomm\u00e9 with fresh pound cake and lemon sorbet. Everything was outstanding, and even though were stuffed both nights, we managed a few bites of dessert each time.\n\nI am most certain that I will go back to Spago each and every time I am in Vegas in the  future. It is just that good."

We were worried we were dressed too casual, but it doesn't seem to be that big of a deal. Also, we went in around 8-9ish and we were seated without having to wait.\n\nThe bread basket they give you is so good! They give you raisin bread, a cheesy/onion bread, and parmesan cracker crisps. The parmesan cracker crisps were DIVINE - I could eat a million of them, really.\n\nFor appetizers, my boyfriend ordered their crab cakes. YUM! Lots of sweet crab meat, slightly crispy on the edges, and a beautiful presentation with fresh flowers. Another friend ordered their oysters on the half shell, which I didn't try because I'm not that big of a fan of oysters, but everyone who tried it said they were SUPER fresh and delicious.\n\nI ended up ordering their Pan Seared Duck Breast since one of my boyfriend's friends recommended it. It was really good! I loved the sweet sauce they put around the duck and the slightly crispy texture was great, as well. The duck was very moist and pretty much melts in your mouth. Definitely recommend it!\n\nI tried my boyfriend's Kobe Ribeye. SO GOOD! It's the most expensive entree on the menu, but well worth it because the quality and quantity is incredible. So juicy, lots of flavor, and the pomme aligot, which is like cheese melted into mashed potatoes, was amazing with the meat! Although I'd probably regret it later, I could eat that pomme aligot with a spoon. A tip for the Kobe Ribeye is that they cook it differently than other restaurants. My boyfriend ordered it medium well, but it actually looked more like medium rare. Another friend at the table who ordered the same thing asked for it medium rare and it was pretty bloody.\n\nService is very attentive, as well, which I would expect from such a nice restaurant. Overall, good experience there, but it's definitely not an every day type of eating place. We'll probably only be going back if we win in blackjack again, lol."

After being seated in the back (opt'ed for \"fine dining\" which apparently has a different menu than those sitting up front on the patio), our server brought an iPad with drink options and the first thing he asked was if we had any time constraints. Told him that we had to make a 10:00 show (our reservation was at 8:00pm, and seated around 8:05), and he said \"oh that's not a problem\". Showed us the drink menu, and left. Came back about 10 minutes later to take a drink order, but we still didn't even have menus. Ordered drinks and eventually got a food menu which he took a very long time to explain (which was verbatim to what the menu said). I'll just say right now that he had no more than 3 tables to serve, 2 of them were only 2 people/each, and our table had 4.\n\nLeft us for another 10 or 15 minutes, before coming back. We ordered appetizers and entrees at the same time (at his recommendation to avoid any delays in the kitchen). He said that he'd be right back with some bread to munch on. About 15 minutes later, we flagged down his assistant because we'd been there for 45 minutes and had nothing to eat - his assistant immediately came back with a massive bread platter which everything was amazing on.  \n\nBeef Tartare, Oysters and a Fig Burrata salad. All were good, but the fig salad was pretty small on the portion size. All were consumed quickly, and we had to flag the assistant down again to order some more drinks and have him bring the bread back. Looking at the time, it's 9:30 and we don't even have our entrees? Guess he didn't want us to try dessert. Our server comes over and says \"your entrees will be out shortly\". Seriously? After we reminded him that we had a place to be at, he said he would \"push the kitchen\". A few minutes later, he returned with our food. Entrees were good, although the portion size was a little light for the price. I've spent the same amount of money (or even less) at places like STK or Lavo and gotten twice the food. Didn't have a lot of time to enjoy the food, and had to flag down our server's assistant (I wish we could have tipped him, because he was about 100x more attentive to us than our actual server was) for the check. Of course, Miguel made an appearance to take our money and bring us a couple dessert bites. Literally ran through the casino to make it to our show on time. \n\nWill not be returning - if you want an amazing dinner at Caesars .. try MESA Grill. 2 stars only because the food was good - not amazing, but good."

Wolfgang's Chinese take on chicken salad still is the best!  Never miss this restaurant when I come to Vegas.  Only bummer is they have changed their dessert menu; don't like the changes."

We started with their margarita and tuna sashimi flatbreads.  I then could not decide between a Spanish inspired seared ahi tuna or a French inspired halibut...Chef Klein happened to walk by and following a few minutes of pleasant conversation, I choice the halibut...amazing!  Banana bread pudding was a great conclusion.  Only negative is that it would have been nice to have a broader variety of reasonably priced wines.  Highly recommend."

For the first time, my friends and I decided that it's time to go eat somewhere nice for once instead of Mc D's and Chipotle everyday meal.  We originally were split into two tables since they told us they can only accommodate 8 ppl max per table.  When we arrived they were able to put both of our tables together.  One thing I didn't like about this idea was that dealing with the check would be a hassle.  BUT thankfully the waitress was able to split our table's check into two.  MAJOR BROWNIE pts!  \n\nNow to the food.  I don't know what my friends ordered, but I'm sure they were delicious.\n\nI ordered:\n\nTRIO OF TUNA\nSashimi, Avocado, Daikon Radish, Scallion and Yuzu-Wasabi\nCrispy Rice Cake, Marinated Cucumber & Hearts of Palm with Soy Ceviche-Ginger Vinaigrette\nTartare, Sesame Tuile \"Taco\" with Chili Mayo and Masago Caviar\n\nThis dish was served to perfection!  Each small taster was amazingly delicious.  The tuna sashimi was paired perfectly with the daikon radish, scallion and Yuzu-wasabi.  The crispy rice cake was awwwesome!  I mean the fish was good, but fried rice cake...MmMMm!  The Tartare had a spicy kick to it, but not enough to make you scream to death.\n\nCOLORADO RACK OF LAMB\nGreen Garbanzo Falafel, English Pea Hummus, Marinated Heirloom Tomato Fattoush,\nMint-Cilantro Tzatziki and Zhatar\n\nYum!  The lamb was cooked perfectly.  It was slightly pink in the middle, but not bloody.  The falafel was delicious!  I swear these taste like meat, but not. haha\n\nMy friend ordered:\n\nPAN SEARED BREAST OF DUCK\nSemolina Fondue, Morel Mushrooms, Cipollini Onions, Carrots, Peas,\nGlazed Cherries and Sauce \u00e0 L'Orange\n\nWhat more can I ask for?  Normally when I go to a nice restaurant I usually choose the duck or the lamb.  Tonight I had the experience to try both.  It was sure mouth watering!  Really moist and succulent.  Just delicious! MMmMMm I can go for some right now!\n\nDessert:\n\nSince this was for my birthday...they gave me a free dessert.  A cheese cake with mixed berries on top and a raspberry sorbet on the side.  It was very cheesy and tart.  I'm not a dessert kind of guy, but a free dessert is always yummy.\n\nOverall, if you haven't tried out Spago yet...I highly recommend it!"

We split an Organic Mixed Field Green Salad. The salad was soggy and wilted from the excessive amount of vinaigrette. I'd recommend to ask for the dressing on the side. The roasted bell pepper was really delicious! My boyfriend had the Roasted Organic Chicken Breast which was absolutely divine! I ended up deserting my pizza to eat half of his entree. The chicken was so moist and paired well with the roasted potatoes. I highly recommend this entree. I ordered the Chicken Sausage Pizza. It was very tasty and the crust was amazing! My boyfriend's mother is Vegan so she ordered the Mushroom Pizza with no cheese and no tomato sauce. It was really crispy like a flatbread and light. \n\nWe also ordered a bottle of Talbott Pinot Noir which was amazing! It was $56 but sooooo worth it! Service was exceptional~we were having so much fun that we were the last customers to leave. I will definitely return for their excellent food and service!"

Came here last Sunday and had a blast...My T's newest addition Max kept us well entertained.\n\nI'm a huge meatloaf fan, and I came here not knowing that they were known for their meatloaf and the yelpers had reviewed it so much.  So we shared the 6 course seasonal tasting and had the meatloaf on the side in case we didn't get full.\n\nThe 6 course tasting is great... from kobe sliders, to sashimi spoons, to flatbreads.  The final meat dish (pork loin and pork belly was not the best ending to the tasting.  The pork belly was all fat).  Everything else was great.\n\nI would definitely order from the menu, whether its the cafe menu or the actual dinner menu.  Pancetta wrapped meatloaf!!!!  Try it!!!  It is definitely the densest meatloaf I've had.  Very filling.\n\nSo there are two menus, the cafe one is actually really affordable, if you are looking for a quick casual bite."

So what could go wrong?  \nNOTHING ABSOLUTELY, NOTHING!  \nLoved the place!!!!!!!!\nSpago is located inside Caesar Forum Shops among expensive shops and a beautiful environment with a Roman theme (Dah,  Caesar's Palace)  \nHas an external seating area which provides a great spot for people watching. (see photo)  We reserved a spot there and were promptly seated at 7. \nOrdered a bloody Mary (spicy) which arrived in a tallish glass with olives and a pickled green bean.  When was the last time you had a pickled green bean with your bloody mary?  Tasted like a dill pickle only better. The stuffed olives were great too (not salty) and the spiciness of the drink did not disappoint.  (see photo) \n\nWe were then served the nirvana of nirvana's--Beautiful, crusty delicious bread with a ramekin of extra virgin olive oil.  Really good.  Would you be surprised if I told you we asked for a second helping of this deliciousness?  (see photo) \nWe split the Chinese chicken salad as an appetizer and when it arrived it was so big we thought the server had forgotten to split it.  AND THEN WE TASTED IT.  It was absolutely amazing with all types of cabbages (e.g.Napa, red cabbage), sugared cashews, moist chicken, sesame oil and other elements in the dressing. Don't know what makes it so delicious, but I could eat this salad every single day.  Hubby said it was the best salad he has ever had in a restaurant.  (see photo) \nFor entrees, we ordered the seabass on a bed of some veggies including chipolini onions.  We also had the spaghettini pasta, with a simple sauce of tomato, extra virgin olive oil, and basil strips.  (see photos) \nThe portions were good, prices were very fair, and the food was delicious.  \nNo room for dessert though... I think all that bread had a bit to do with it but they did have very good choices on their dessert menu.  \n\nService was provided by Karen who was super attentive without being overbearing.  When we left the staff said goodby and thanked us for coming.  They know how to do it at Spago's; it will be one of my go-to spots when in Vegas."

The staff really went above and beyond. \nDinner started off with the most delcious bread medley -- parmesan , raisin bread, focaccia, rye. The best! We split the Margherita pizza and the Kobe burger. The pizza was best pizza I've probably ever consumed. The cheese blend was out of this world, topped off with the freshest basil, tomatoes and spices. The Kobe beef burger was sensational --a delicious melding of juicy beef,applewood bacon and aioli sauce.  \nI must say Spago's is my favorite restaurant in Vegas so far.

They have managers and staff that do it right. \nChef Eric Klein, had spent Monday refitting the entire kitchen line, and was into his 26 hour without rest, I think. Our waiter was on it.

Ok, on to the rest. \n\nWish I could keep my review at around 5 stars, but here's the thing:\n1. The margherita pizza that my lady friends ordered didn't come with any basil! For some reason, I totally tuned out what they were eating, until I took a bite of the last piece of their pizza. Yes, to a server, this sounds like a typical, \"We ate the whole thing, but didn't notice until the last piece\" - rip-the-waiter-off scenario. But sadly, IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED THAT WAY. When I brought it up to our server Tony, and told him that the ladies had been too nice to bring it up, he gave me the \"you're trying to rip us off punk\" look, and said, I'll bring it up with the manager. When the bill came, nothing had happened, no apologies, nothing. We paid for a bland cheese pizza with tomatoes on it! Hey Tony, next time, just err on the side of trust and take off the damn pizza from the check that my friends had to endure...bless their hearts. As a server at at a fine dining restaurant, YOU are responsible for making sure every ingredient is on the dish BEFORE it hits the table. I'm sure T is a great guy, but management, I don't want him as my server next time. Thank you. :) (I'm still trying to forgive myself for choosing to pay for it...)\n\n2. The last time I had the Pancetta Wrapped Meat Loaf, it had more beef and less of whatever they put in it this time. This time it was essentially a Sausage Loaf. The gravy and sauces were a bit off this time. I think the gravy turned out to be more of a watered down version of salsa verde, and the port wine sauce kind of got lost in the mix. The redeeming value of the dish? The potato/sweet potato puree and spinach. SOOOOOO good. \n\n3. The crispy calamari was just that. Crispy breading and tasty rings of squid. But all of us agreed that the marinated cucumbers and hearts of palm with coriander vinaigrette was the highlight of the dish. \n\nIn the end, my recommendation is sit at the bar, your service will be phenomenal. \n\nPS: Is it not a requirement in Vegas anymore that servers have to have a nametag? I had to specifically ask Tony his name when he came to the table. No nametag..."

Our table was a bit wobbly so they switched out the table entirely for us even though it was getting busy. We had a complimentary soup to start off with that melted in our mouths... The chef came out and introduced himself prior to it as well. We decided to split a salad to start, with arugula, prosciutto San Daniele, and burrata cheese. We then each had a pasta and split it. I tried the spaghettini with truffles, she had the gnocchi. The spaghettini was al dente just how it needs to be, and the truffles.... I'm salivating! Lastly, scallops and duck breast. The texture of the scallops was perfect! Even the bread was awesome. Everything was so amazing. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Nikki was a fantastic server, knowledgeable about everything on the menu including the wines- request her! It was such a special NYE meal. Don't miss out on this gem in Caesar's!"

Sliders were the best ever, and the homemade fettuccini was perfectly chewy and fresh. Had a chocolate raspberry cake for dessert that was to die for!

This review is relevant to my last visit and every previous one as well. \n\nSat on a Tuesday in the dining room and enjoyed the tasting menu with three other people. Warm welcome as I came in from two managers and the hostess. Tip: If you like tastings, this one is $120 ... Tell them that is what you want to do up front. You get VIP treatment from the beginning (kinda like booking bottle service in the club). Anyways, awesome greet. \n\nUpon seating everything is really easy. You can do wine pairing or just order to your liking. We chose to do cocktails and order to everyone's likes, but the wine list looked awesome... Maybe next time. \n\nFood was spectacular, my favorites being the tomato salad and sea bass. Presentation of every dish was original and with a purpose. Artistic enough to cause conversation every course. The flavors that ensued caused all conversation to cease immediately. Only smiles and moans ensued. \n\nService was top notch. Everyone who approached the table ( easily 10 different people spread out over two hours) knew their role and executed properly and with no pretentiousness and the perfect amount of personal. Mickel was our point guy and was awesome the whole time. The executive chef even came by our table a few times to check on us... This really made the night special because you can tell he is super humble and appreciative of everybody who enjoys his food. He makes you feel like he prepares the dishes just for you and his only goal is to make you leave with a smile. \n\nThe entire meal was amazing and I can't wait to go back."

Ok now for my food review which took place on Dec 6, 2008 (yes the night Pacquiao kicked DeLa Hoya's butt. I missed that fight cause I was eating here..was it worth it?? ..you betcha!).\n\nOMG... I dream of that free range chicken, oh so delectably juicy and wonderful as you chew it in your mouth, with a hint of goat cheese that was carefully tucked under the crispy skin of that oh so yummy poultry meat... Accompanied wonderfully with that dreamy chicken, was potatoes... with it smoothly mashed to melting consistency, and  root veggies all crisped perfectly and not a bland or undercooked bite at all , and the natural jus..the sauce that was so warm and perfect and provided a flavorful blanket for all the above. I have to say it was a heavenly dish....it didn't make me feel weighed down or like I had too much to eat..I smiled every time I took a bite...\n\nNow for dessert...i had the chocolate flour-less cake with pralines..it's a very skinny slice of cake but boy oh boy was it a gigantic awesome burst of flavor in your mouth! It was also very delicious and didn't taste too sweet or wasn't overburdened with sauce or icing. It came with a little scoop of hazlenut ice cream and it was the PERFECT ending to one of the best meals in my life..seriously... \n\nOh and to add to my experience, the group I was with had the tasting menu ( I didn't because I had a little too many mojitos the night before at the V bar and the night ended with me bowing to the porcelin god). I tasted a tiny bit from my sister's plate of everything she got and I'll say that everything was awesome...The wait staff was also VERY accommodating  and they did an excellent job. Everyone left Spago 's very very HAPPY..I'll be back there around New Year's...free range chicken...I'm coming home!"

Atmosphere and service are great and it's fun to sit on the walk and people watch, but the food was truly forgettable.  Tartare app was boring, Caesar salad was good, Shrimp Scampi pasta was barely digestible, and Rigatoni Bolognese was ok, not great.  Standout was the Wiener Schnitzel, which was actually delightful, but isn't this an Italian restaurant?  We have limited time in Vegas, this is not a place at which to waste it."

I was surprised that they could take us immediately without a reservation, and we chose to sit in the dining room rather than the cafe (different menu). We all loved the food, from flatbread margarita pizza starter, to salad, entree, and chocolate souffle (that we didn't need to order in advance), but what we were really impressed with was the service. Whoever manages this location must be top notch, because the service was impeccable! It seemed as if each waiter had a 'shadow' that they were training, as there were many waiters and servers at all times. They come in a group to serve you all at once, which is always a nice touch. I took a liking to Luis (they call him Lulu, as apparently there are many Luis's there), as he used a napkin to refill water to avoid splashing on the guests. I commented on this to him and he was flattered. But what I was really impressed with is that at one point, my 80 y/o mom and sister went to the bathroom mid-meal, which was upstairs. Lulu noticed that my mom was intimidated by the stairs, so he offered his arm to personally accompany her to the elevator. My mother was most impressed! It's the personal touches that makes an impression in this wildly competitive business of restaurants. Spago, I applaud you for training your staff to be top notch and for making your guests feel special. I will be back each time I visit Vegas!"

It used to be I could confidently reserve a seat along the rail and be assured of great service, food, and people watching.  The food is still wonderful, but my last two visits the service was so inattentive that I won't be back. We had to flag down our server or other employees to get drinks, water refills, or our check.  It was difficult when we had appointments after dinner to get attention to close out our check and we were not there during peak hours (typically we end up there at about 4 or 5 pm with a reservation).  Hopefully those last 2 visits were a fluke, but I won't be chancing it in the future when I only have a limited time to eat great meals during my Vegas trips."

Eat it Easy..)\n\nSpago Pancetta - Wrapped  Meatloaf: Not bad, not bad at all.. Now this was a dish that had some thought put into it. The Meatloaf  had a mild but complex flavor that didn't remind me of a traditional home cooked meatloaf, rather an Excellently Executed Gourmet Meatloaf. Every bite with the potato, loaf, gravy and sauce was Absolutely Mesmerizing! Now, this is what I'm talking about!\n\nSpaghettini T.B.G: Sometimes Little is More..

We happened to be in Ceasars Forum Shops and stopped here for dinner.  The place was near empty on a Wednesday night and we were treated to impeccable service.  The chef even came out to say hello a few times.  I honestly dont' remember what we all ordered but EVERYTHING was better than good.  Trust your server's recommedations as they never steered us wrong.  Even with drinks they nailed it.  We had a seasonal pumpkin martini that was so good we all asked for the recipe.  The chef hand wrote it and had it delivered to our table!  Even though Spago is no longer the trendy spot, they still got it."

Definitely come if you have time to kill because the food takes a while but is beautifully displayed and tastes amazing! Caviar and asparagus are the best I've tasted. You can taste the organic nature of the olive oil they serve with their bread. I have never tasted juicier or more tender beef than what they serve as their beef skewer appetizer. We have been here for over two hours and are waiting on desert. Hence the 4 stars. Really great food exceptional service. Just really slow... Didn't seem that busy either. I had their hand cut fettuccine as my main course and it was also delicious as was their wood oven pizza. I highly recommend just be prepared for long conversation time."

I also like how the food is something you'd get at an upscale restaurant (hello hand made fresh pasta) but since you're kinda sitting off to the side of a mall like area, it doesn't feel like a stuffy and snotty high end place.  That's a win win for me.  The hubby got the pepperoni pizza while I got the spaghetti with fresh marinara sauce.  Oh, we also got the crab cakes for any appetizer.  The grab cakes were amazing.  Definitely the best we've ever had, ever!  The crab meat was extremely fresh and who would've thought to put a sprig of celery leaf on top.  Seriously, that made all the difference in the world.  Must find recipe to try at home!  The pizza was amazing as well and might I add, quite large.  The pasta was just okay in my opinion.  The fresh pasta is a very nice touch but it just doesn't quite have the texture that I love so much from the dried pasta.  It actually reminded me a lot of chinese noodles which is probably why it threw me off a bit swimming in marinara sauce.  Now the sauce was incredible.  I would drink that straight out of a cup.  I've been coming to this place since I was 17 and hopefully I'd be coming back for many more years to come."

The food and service was very good and there were always lots of choices.  However, it was always a little pricier than it should have been but given its location and our family tradition, we were willing to forego this consideration.   Our most recent visit, however, was disappointing.  \n\nThe menu had been revamped and our familiar casual choices were gone.  The bread basket was replaced with an offer of one piece of bread per person. Moreover, the $20-$30 entree range had been replaced with most entrees in the $30 to $50, with one beef entree over $70.  We ordered a range of things and most choices were still pretty good (although the crab spaghettini was dry and crab seemed right out of the can) but portions were small and so the meal seemed disproportionate to prices.  Maybe Spago's is now aiming for a higher, more formal dining experience but in the end, the Forum Shops are really just a mall.  There are lots of restaurants in Las Vegas and there a lot of other choices for better values.  We won't be going back."

Not the case, we waited about 10 minutes and we were told there was a option to dine indoors or 'outdoors' - at this point I said dining outdoors.  We were then told that the menus are different depending on where you sit and I still mentioned that outdoors was fine for the group.  We were seated and guess what - there was the 'other menu' that was only for the indoors guest.  I already started realizing their staff have NO idea what's going on and there isn't consistent communication between the owner and staff as to what should be communicated to guests.  But our night gets better...\n\nWe were seated and our waiter (whom we saw once and only once) asked to take our orders.  We were relatively quick in giving our orders to the waiter and he said he would put the order in.  We were given our bread and we munched on it as I checked the clock.  Dinner reservations were at 6pm (I always expect incompetence) and our show was at 9:30pm.  Well, this \"Spago\" place had us waiting for our meals for over 1 HOUR.  Meanwhile our unattentive, incompetent waiter AND owner did not even come by our table to explain to us what the issue was (if there was any issue).  Anybody in the restaurant business, or any business would say to keep an open line of communication with your customers so it APPEARS that you know what in the actual f*** is going on in the kitchen.  I understand being understaffed, or a kitchen rush, or whatever it may be but not a word from these two.  Nobody came by except the man who was very attentive to refilling our waters.  \n\nNow, once we received our food people were relatively happy, but one person was disgusted as the salmon was overcooked.  At that rate, we should've asked them to use the kitchen and cooked the meal ourselves. Seriously,  if anyone has to wait that long the food better be amazing and when everyone isn't happy it is a tremendous fail.  We heard all of the BS about about the food being handmade but explain to me how there was another table that came in WAY after us and had their food WAY before us.  And they weren't appetizers.  The manager of this restaurant didn't care but we wanted a business card so we can follow up with the general manager since they are a separate establishment - guess what? he didn't have any.  What manager doesn't have business cards on them? \n\nI wouldn't recommend you going here and I wouldn't recommend my enemy going here either. This is just not worth your time OR MONEY...there are better restaurants out there for competitive prices.  Nothing to see at this establishment but they are clearly enjoying the benefit of being inside the Forum Shops.  Don't say you weren't warned..."

You can't live here and not eat here at least once. I support this mostly because it has been around for so long and has not been transformed into another eatery.\n\nWolfgang Puck is doing a good job here. It isn't a home-run, but it is damn close. \n\nMy friend and I dined on a Wednesday night at about 6 PM. We chose to sit \"outside\" versus inside of the restaurant. Each place has its own menu. Dining inside means paying more money, basically.\n\nBeing outside is fine though, and boasts a menu with many great options. \n\nThe beginning of the meal is what draws the most ire for me. They presented some bread, which is fine, but the bread was boring and the butter was hard as a rock. If the bread had been warm, the butter being cold wouldn't have been such an issue, but with both the bread and butter being cold, it was hard to spread. I know, am I a whiny brat, or what? *cringes at my own hoity-toity-ness*\n\nWe started with the Maryland crab cakes, topped with heirloom tomatoes, aioli, and herbs. The cakes were small, but fresh. Fresh taste = good for me. Tomatoes were a nice acidic addition.\n\nMy main course was the braised beef short ribs. Spectacular. Moist and mouth-watering. Falls apart under your fork. A bit of fattiness (to be expected). But this dish starts cooking in the early morning and by the time you are having it at 6:30 PM at night - perfection! Came with asparagus and gnochi. Gnochi was only okay. It was a bit over-cooked. Minor detail.\n\nLastly, we had the Valrhona Chocolate Cremeux. A lovely little dessert, incredibly rich, with fresh raspberries and an almond-crunch center. My friend also partook of some tea, which they boast quite a menu full of numerous varieties with interesting descriptions. For instance, my friend's tea was described as \"Fresh Cut Grass/Ocean Mist\". I thought it tasted like green tea, but smelt a bit like my front yard in the Summer.\n\nI'm glad I tried Spago. I think it is doing well and holding its own. There's no reason I would not go back."

We made reservations early for a Thursday night and asked the maitre d if they could do a tasting menu for a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian at the same time.  He laughed and said it wouldn't be a problem if the chef was in a good mood.\n\nWhen we arrived, I asked our server if the chef was in a good mood and he responded \"Yes, and we love vegetarians!\"  In fact, he told me that they can accomodate people of all allergies, sensitivities and preferences including vegan or gluten free.\n\nThe reason Stefan D did not get a written tasting menu is because the chef makes it up as he goes along (which we learned from the chef two years ago when we came to the same location for the tasting menu and he came out to visit with us toward the end of our meal).  Although each course is not a great deal of food, you will be absolutely stuffed by the end.  The most spectacular part of the meal for me was these enormous ice teardrops that were hollow and contained two spoons of different delicious dishes.  (My nonvegetarian husband asked me three times to tell him what the house made lychee beads were he loved them so much).\n\nAs expected, most of the dishes for me were vegetarian versions of the meat dishes - I got a portobello burger instead of Kobe beef, but I'm not a big fan of portobello normally and I LOVED it.\n\nThe service was also excellent.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about this Spago.  It was an experience you don't want to miss.

The restaurant location and size was a bit of a surprise as I expected something more exclusive rather than a place alongside retail shops. The food on the other hand was delicious! A restaurant that places quality over quantity. I went here with a group and was able to taste several dishes. I personally had the half organic chicken and it was amazing. It was cooked to perfection,and flavor throughout the chicken. The meat fell off the bone. This is the place i had my first taste of ratatouille and it was very delicious veggie dish that looked very difficult to prepare. I tasted the filet mignon and had several dishes I don't remember by name. I can highly recommend this place as everything I've tasted from here was a palate full of flavor!"

We stopped here for a pizza (lamb chorizo) ($15) and the beef bolognaise ($20). The pizza was really good, though the 'braised beef' bolognaise was really braised ground beef. I had expected more...\nThe seasonal menu looked amazing, but was a little more than we wanted to spend that night ($20-40 an entree)."

Great food, great service, and great ambiance. \n\nLast time I was here, I had the free range organic chicken and it was great. If you've never had free range chicken, you are missing out on the best poultry you can eat. Cooked to perfection, flavourful, and juicy. It's a little \"tougher\" than regular chicken which gives it a wonderful texture. \n\nThe sole fish special was also spectacular, though a bit on the small side (actually, it's exactly what a single serving should be). A cut of fresh sole wrapped with ham and breaded. They cook or marinade it in a slightly sweet sauce that I can only describe as heavenly. \n\nThe short ribs were tender, juicy, and succulent. They don't even bother asking you how you want it cooked like amateurs... they just bring it out, cooked to perfection. \n\nThe service was outstanding. We had a show at 7PM and the wait staff made sure we waited for nothing. Everything came out fast, nothing was left unattended for more than a minute, and yet we never felt rushed by the staff. \n\nI usually make it a rule--when on a trip (business or pleasure), never eat at the same place twice. Life's too short for reruns... but Spago is one of the few exceptions."

I once had the chance to tour the kitchen here, and it was un-fucking-believeable: a walk-in full of fresh organic veggies from the local Farmer's Market, another walk-in full of house-made pasta in every shape and size, and a third full of freshly glistening dissected animal parts, patiently waiting all plump and juicy and pink. Staff sweated intently throughout, and one guy was hunched over a plate, patiently de-tangling strands of corn silk with two forks, as intent as if he were performing brain surgery...all to garnish the plate of some Botox-faced Newport Beach poseur who was probably just gonna puke it up in the bathroom after one too many daiquiris at the Celine Dion show anyway. \n\nSince it's been around forEVER, Spago doesn't get much hype any more...but the fact is, it's BOMB-ASS, farm-fresh, expertly prepared food of exceptional quality with an ever-changing menu featuring stuff that's actually in season, depending on the time of year. \n\nAnything I've ever had here has been excellent -- both in the cafe out front, and in the fine dining area in the back. On my last visit we sampled some of the house-made sausages, which were amazing, along with some lobster salad, pear salad with house-made yogurt sauce and pear butter (YUM!!) and a sort of garden salad made with tomatoes and arugula fresh from the local farmer's market that very morning. Even the bread basket was exceptional, with an assortment of truly adventurous breads (and no fucking pretzel bread -- which I consider the sign of an amateur).\n\nBut the BEST part about Spago is the people watching! If you sit in the cafe area (and order off the cafe menu), you are treated to the best spectacle this side of Fremont Street: the Forum Shops! You can sit sipping a glass of wine, watching the parade of tragic fashion slaves and aspirational bourgeoisie strutting past, arms laden with bagsful of ill-financed luxury purchases. You'll see few members of the genuine gentry, but plenty of poseurs: makeup-caked Mexican trophy wives, haughty ex-whore girlfriends of Russian oligarchs, shop-happy Japanese, etc. It's the greatest show on Earth!"

The anise lent a hint of licorice.\n\nM and I shared a salad appetizer (chopped salad) and chicken entree (roasted chicken). Both were delicious. The chopped salad was especially noteworthy. It had toasted quinoa on top that was wonderfully crunchy and nutty.\n\nOur server was pleasing and was exactly what we wanted.\n\nThe space at Spago is quite large.

Park in self parking and make a left and Spago is on the right. \n\nThe hostess was nice enough to offer a multitude of seating, but we could have cared less. I blame the tourists for making the host so unsure of their selection. They always say \"we want that seat\", no \" we want that seat\". In any other town what the host picks, the guests gets. It was given to you for a reason you may understand only when your food takes forever or your service starts lacking, but I digress.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful on the inside without all the gaudiness of MIX or the thumping of the club restaurants. I ordered the open faced meatball sub which was made with chicken and my friend ordered the bolognaise (their spelling, not mine). Perhaps, they got tired of ppl mis-pronouncing it.\n\nIt's odd when you go to a restaurant and expect nothing. You become instantly happier. I didn't ask if there was a side with the sandwich. At the least,  I just expected it to be a sandwich on a plate. I got that and much more. An overly tasty, perfectly portioned and seasoned salad with a saucy chicken meatball sub with gooey melted mozzarella cheese. The pesto sauce didn't hurt either. The bolognaise looked like the best bolognese I've seen in quite some time. Saucy, meaty, rich and it smelled wonderful.\n\nThe server was pretty cool in that he left us alone. I guess two guys eating alone don't need as much attention as a married couple, old people, or two people who have never eaten out before. Regardless, he was great, except he didn't fill our water glasses when we finished and just as well it was probably our que to move on to the next appt in the day."

I came to Spago three years ago (don't remember anything from then except that I liked it) so I recommended it. \n\nFirst off, top notch service. Our waiter was friendly but not too overwhelmingly so. He left us alone to chat and enjoy our meal. We started off with a sangria topped with sweet fruit chunks that my fiance devoured. \nThen we ordered: (Descriptions posted from their Cafe Menu at http://www.wolfgangpuck.com/restaurants/fine-dining/9044)\n\nTuna Sashimi -Crispy Rice Cake, Marinated Cucumbers, Hearts of Palm with WasabiGinger Vinaigrette. Best sushi I have EVER had IN MY LIFE! The sashimi melted in your mouth while the rice cake added just enough crisp to give it a little zing. The sauces complemented the flavors perfectly! \n\nAnd since we weren't too hungry, we split the Wood-fired Mushroom pizza which consisted of Roasted Portabellas, Caramelized White Onions, Italian Parsley and Parmesan. I don't even really like portabellas and this was the best pizza ever. The cheese was great but not too cheesy, the pizza felt light and tasty, and the crust was perfectly baked and crunchy. I have died and gone to food heaven. \n\nOne of the best meals I've ever had, period. A must visit while in Vegas! Located inside of The Forum Shops at Cesar's palace so a perfect break while shopping and walking! If you order the cafe menu, the environment is more relaxing and less expensive than the dinner, although dinner is great too!"

It is one of the most consistent places I've been in Vegas. \nWe usually try to eat at the Spago cafe in the \"outside\" patio as opposed to the more formal and expensive main restaurant area. I found out on my last visit though that the lunch menu is the same for both areas but if you want a more casual and less pricey dinner, I would stick with the cafe. You will still get a great experience and a fantastic meal either way. \nMany of the dishes here rotate seasonally but some of the best stay on the menu year round. Make sure to sample the bread basket, I love that crispy cracker thing they serve. My husband says the free range chicken here is just about the best chicken he's had. I always get the gazpacho here when they have it but unfortunately, that only seems to be a few months a year. However, their soups are amazing here. On my last visit, I had a cream of mushroom soup that came with a fancy grilled cheese sandwich and it was mouthwatering. One of the best soups I can remember having. Some of the other dishes I've tried that I've enjoyed were the pappardele (although it is a bit on the heavy side) as well as the chicken salad sandwich. Spago is known for their pizzas but it's been a long time since I've ordered that here so I really can't comment on that. \nAll in all I love the food here and I love what this restaurant represents to Vegas. This was pretty much the first high end restaurant to open in Vegas in the early 90s and people were shocked that it did well. If not for Spago's success, Vegas would not be the high end dining mecca it has become."

I loved that there is \"outdoor\" seating, meaning that you can eat on the patio of the restaurant under the blue sky ceiling of the forum shops. Makes you feel like your on a patio in Europe. We had a very nice waitress. I ordered and cosmo - my standard, and then a glass of pinto grigio with dinner. We had the hand cut fettuccini and chicken sausage pizza - both were amazing!

Minuscule is how I would describe it with maybe a half of a beet for $19. Sorry I didn't take any pictures of our salad from last night. My husband ordered the calamari and shrimp pizza and I ordered pasta. Our total bill for two was very close to $100. The only reason for the three stars is the pizza did have a good flavor and so did the pasta. Other than that the whole experience was underwhelming. I can only assume they're going through changes as most of the staff looked very rushed and on edge. There was nothing relaxing or calming about this experience at all.

            "review": "All the restaurants at Caesar's were full for dinner, so we ventured into the Forum Shops and stumbled on Spago. Having eaten there before for lunch, we decided to try  it for dinner. After looking at the menu, we decided to share most courses, starting with Calimari, then a Caesar salad, and finally, the italian sausage pizza and a bowl of gnocci.\n\nThe food was good; my only complaint about the food that that the gnocci was $21 and the portion was small. \n\nThe reason for my 3-star rating was the service. Saying it was \"attentive\" would be an understatement. I like attentive service just as much as the next person, but the waitress and her assistants acted like they were in a Keystone Cops' movie where all of the action is accelerated. I no sooner put down my fork then the next course came and had not finished my glass of wine before the bus person whisked it off the table. It was very obvious she wanted to turn the table for the next diners, but honestly, for a check that totaled $95 before tip, Spago should let its diners relax a bit. \n\nOn the way out, I mentioned the problem to the hostess who offered to get the manager. I suppose I should have let her, but we had already paid the bill and were on our way out.  We may be back, but only if we could eat at the bar."

My wife had the veal and I had the ahi tuna, both were marvelously presented and tasted phenomenal. Eat bite was savored. We pair our meals with the four vine Chardonnay (meat), and the Pinot noir (fish). Great choices. For dessert we had the apple crumble prepared in a bourbon sauce. That was the only part of the meal we would only give four stars. Everything else was five star.\n\nThe one drawback was the overwhelming noisy atmosphere. Might be their design intention though. We would recommend!"

The problem was not in the food it was the service, took a while to order our drinks, brought the wrong ones, could nit get refills, the first course finally came, them they did not clear our plates for 25 minutes, finally the pizza came, after we reminded them, and asked a third time for refills. \n\nThen had to ask another sever to get our bill be cayuse our server disappeared (for 10 minutes), he came back into view and took an order for a party of 10. We realize things can get crazy but there are others that can help out. Stay out of the middle tables, they seem to be the \"runway\" to others and we were forgotten along with the table next to us.\n\nWould dine again, just at another table."

We were immediately approached by one of our servers.  Everyone who spoke to us, including the manager were great.\n\nWe started with the Olsen Farm's Baby Arugula Salad.  The salad comes with Bartlett Pears, burrata, prosciuitto, vinegar and olive oil.  The flavors combined nicely.  It was a nice start to the meal.\n\nNext we ordered the Pumpkin Agnolotti.  I am not a huge pumpkin fan, but the flavors together were very good.  Mascarpone comes on the side and the agnolotti comes with with parmesan and truffles.  The textures also blend well together.\n\nFor my meal I ordered the Grilled Prime Beef Filet.  The filet was prepared perfectly.  It comes with carmelized red onions, watercress, celery, fingerling potatoes, bone marrow persillade and peppercorn sauce.  While the filet is clearly the focus, the other components add even more to the meal.  The filet is seasoned lightly.\n\nFor dessert we chose the Peanut Butter Souffle.  It takes about ten minutes for them to prepare it, but it is well worth that short wait.  It is so fluffy, and filled with rich peanut butter flavor.  The lemon ice cream on the side seemed out to me, but they went quite well together.  Our server recommended we add a shot of chocolate liquor to the bottom of the plate for even more flavor.  It stepped up the flavor even more.\n\nIt was a pricey meal.  That being said, it is well worth it for the experience."

They all melted in my mouth.  \n\nThe service was great.  We were seated right away without a reservation.  Plus, you can get the full menu sitting out on the patio or \"cafe\" side. \nSeveral times thoughout our meal, the chef came out to check on us.  At the end we gave him a great big thank you!  \n\nI am a new convert to tasting menus.  Try all the chef's specialties at once, then you'll know what to order next time.

This meant that we waited until 11 pm to eat dinner. One would think that this would not be a problem in Las Vegas. I clearly remember a wilder youth when this was not a problem. However, that wilder youth had much lower standards and we looked far too nice to settle for the cheap crap at O' Shea's. After several closed doors and unsympathetic hosts throughout Ceasar's, we found this place still open in the mall. They had a limited menu, but we didn't care.\n\nOur adorable, brunette waitress whose name I sadly forgot was stellar. Super friendly and attentive. Ten stars. No question.\n\nThe food was ok. My non-Italian father could make better pasta. And I didn't like his pasta when I was growing up. However, the pizza was pretty good. Not incredible. But pretty good. Even the New Yorker tolerated it.\n\nThe drinks were terrible. Both my manhattan and his martini were undrinkable. \n\nThe bathrooms were a disaster. Absolute disaster. They looked more like the bathrooms after the 7th inning of an A's game rather than those of a nice restaurant in Vegas. I know it was midnight when I went, but come on. I should not have only one choice of stalls to go into because the others were dirty, strewn with paper products, unflushed, or had menstral blood dripping across them. Have some pride and clean your %$#@ing bathrooms. And while on the topic, seriously ladies?!?!?!?!? How drunk and tore up are you that you can't flush a toilet or wipe up your own period? Cleaning bathrooms is gross enough without your careless antics. Nasty skanks!\n\nSo, get the pizza, order drinks they cannot screw up, and use the casino restroom instead."

I've been to a few Wolfgang Puck Express locations, and I never remembered a bad experience. So, you can say this was my first fine-dining excursion by the celebrity chef.\n\nI'll skip right to the food. The complimentary amuse bouche of potato and cauliflower soup (in a teeny cup) was a nice touch to start things off. The selection of complimentary bread was great -- they provided some olive oil, salt, and pepper for dipping too.\n\nGrilled octopus salad (4 stars) - chunks of octopus were incredibly tender. The little bit of citrus from the preserved lemon really brought out the flavors. The white bean ragout provided a nice, starchy contrast to the protein of the octopus.\n\nNew England diver sea scallops (3 stars) - three big-sized scallops that were all nicely cooked. It was topped with a foam that barely had any flavor. On the menu, it said it was a white corn-mascarpone emulsion and basil oil. The downer for this dish -- my wife ate the last scallop and it had a really awful-tasting, charred aftertaste. It was probably from the burnt part of the pan, or from reusing a dirty pan instead of a clean one. Her palette was destroyed after that one.\n\nRed wine braised short ribs (3 stars) - nice presentation, with all of the ingredients put together. The short ribs were tender, melt-in-your-mouth, and full of flavor. Overall, I thought the flavors were a bit monotone. Plus, it desperately needed some crunchy texture in the dish. Between the ricotta gnocchi and the meat, it was sort of like eating baby food -- just really, expensive baby food.\n\nService was slow and indifferent throughout the night. It was apparent that they didn't place a high priority on service. For the amount of money they charge here, that's unacceptable. We told them about the bad scallop, and the manager was nice enough to take the entire scallop entree off the bill. That was almost $40. They did earn brownie points for that, but overall I don't see us returning with so many other Vegas restaurants on the bookmark list."

The staff were very nice, and Chef Eric even came by the table while we were there.  \n\nAs I told the chef, this was one of the few restaurants I've been to where I truly felt that I could have ordered anything off the menu and been very happy with it.  I settled on the Choucroute Garnie Royale with all the homemade sausages and just a ton of sauerkraut as well.  Great meal - although I am not a huge fan of blood sausage, it was interesting to try.  We all shared bites of our meals, and the filet was great, the chicken with goat cheese was great, and the short ribs were amazing - although my meal was excellent, next time I go the short ribs it is.  \n\nLoved all the breads as well - filled up so much on those we skipped dessert!"

See my picture for the view you get when dining on their patio.\n\nHint:  There are two restaurants here.  The fancy one to the right as you come in and the more casual one to the left.  The fancy one is not better and is more expensive, and there is no patio dining.  The confusion is because there is only one check in stand.

We had planned on just grabbing a quick bite...but the wait staff and wonderful chef turned it into an experience!   We felt fortunate there were no tables available in the people watching front part of the restaurant because the spacious and quiet booth in the back was just what our shopping feet needed.  For starters, the passionfruit Iced Tea was to die for.  It's the first non alcoholic beverage I've ever preferred over wine!  We enjoyed the best kale/spinach  salads chock full of pears, nuts and blue cheese topped with a delicious vinegrette.  We followed it up with a number of starters.  The tunal sashimi appetizer with dipping sauces  was as fresh, light and tasty as you can get as were the crispy shrimp spring rolls.  Can't say enough about the welcoming service and attention-there was never an empty glass or a finished plate on the table for more than a second.  We ate in a lot of really nice restaurants during our stay there, but this lunch turned out to be our favorite experience and memory.  Thank you Spago."

What I was thinking was, \"YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE\" and I've always wanted to eat at this fine dining restaurant, so, Spago it was!\n\nSpago means, \"String\" in English. So, I assumed they picked the word because it sounded classy in America. But anyways, the restaurant wasn't busy at that time, so I was able to grab a seat at the patio right next to the kitchen where I can hear cursing and insults from the chefs and staff.\n\nI was presented with a complimentary bread basket (Sourdough, Wheat, Rye, and Pretzel) with 3 different dips (Olive Oil, Butter, and Sea Salt). They tasted so delicious and I enjoyed the variety of dips with the warm fresh bread baked right from their oven. For my entree, I ordered the Shittake Mushroom Pizza, all for myself!! The pizza was Ohh Mmm mouth watering goodness and the service was excellent. I'm glad to have finally tried one of Wolfgang Pucks, signature Vegas restaurants and looking forward for another dining date."

Unfortunately, we forgot to make a reservation and the wait was too long for us to go there and the concert we wanted to see that night. So my boyfriend and I consulted Yelp and OpenTable and discovered that Spago was supposed to be tasty AND had seating available immediately. We scurried over to the Forum Shops.\n\nWe were seated quickly, but our waiter decided to ignore us initially. The manager came by and started to take our wine order when the waiter finally decided to come by. Our service was just fine after that, so props to the manager. \n\nAfter checking out the menu, we decided on two different pizzas: the lamb chorizo and the Greek. We chose the former because everyone seems to rave about it in their reviews, and the latter because, well, I heart Greek-style pizzas like nobody's business. We chose a tasty glass of albarino to go with our meal.\n\nThe pizzas were great, especially for the price (yeah, $15 for a pizza, but it's Vegas!). Honestly, we could have shared one and been plenty full, but it was nice to be able to taste both types. The lamb chorizo was hearty, meaty, and delicious, but the Greek pizza was my favorite. So many awesome, fresh, flavors. It made me happy. \n\nWe were so temped by the desserts (particularly the Smores thing; that sounded amazing) but we weren't even able to finish our pizzas, so we decided dessert was a bad idea. \n\nIn summary, we were not expecting to dine at Spago that fine Thursday evening, but we did, and it made us happy."

We had just eaten at Le Cirque at the Bellagio the night before so we were hoping to compare the two to which meal we preferred. Ended up didn't have to.  I would rather go to an Olive Garden than have to sit through that service and food at Spago again. Le Cirque wins hands down.\n\nWe got more attention from our busser than our waiter. We saw the couple next to us send back not one, but two of their dishes (one of them was a flattened souffl\u00e9).  For us, firstly, we were supposed to have bread come around with butter and the waiter said he would send someone shortly. They ended up not coming at all. We finally calling the bread person over when we spotted him giving bread to another table. Secondly my boyfriends pasta was luke warm. It was a carbonara which traditionally is topped with pepper but there was no pepper server or pepper shake at all on the tables. Creamy pastas are usually piping hot but this one was almost on the verge of cold. Because of the pepper thing I had to ask our waiter for pepper and he said he would be right back.. never came back. So we asked our busser for one. He also said he would get it.. never came back!! \nI don't think any of our party,plus the rest of the group we were with that weekend, will ever go back.  \nWe had such great hopes ....too bad.

Once we finally ordered, we waited a really long time to get our food.  I'm not sure if it was just what we selected, but I really wasn't happy with my meal.  We had the lamb pizza and the fettuccine.  The pasta was OK, nothing to write home about and the pizza was awful in my opinion.  The crust tasted funny as did the sauce.  I really was disappointed.

I say that because, after we had our salad and tasted the pizza, we were apprehensive about whatever would emerge next from the kitchen.\nThe value in fine dining comes from the value-added by the chef. This means flavor and creativity. But, what I found here was simply an assemblage of ingredients with no discernible contribution from the restaurant. We make goat cheese and beet salad at home with an orange vinaigrette dressing that IMHumbleO is fantastic. But, Spago apparently is too sophisticated to put leaves or dressing on their salad, opting instead for a DROP (literally) of olive oil and b. vinegar with a few pulverized specks of walnuts on top - not even candied, or maybe they were but there was too little to even taste.\n\nThe lamb pizza wasn't very good. It was dry and flavorless. The lamb had no taste - I almost thought it was pepperoni, except that that might have tasted like something.\n\nThe bread was cold and dry, served alongside cold butter.\n\nThe service? Well, I mentioned that the waiter completely forgot my order. It was the handcut fettuccine. He even asked if I wanted chicken or shrimp on it, and still forgot all about it. I'll attribute his oversight to the mercy of fate. Other than that, the service was OK."

Overall, our food tasted good but we both ordered the scallops and had to send them back....twice, for being way too salty. I was surprised when the waiter brought out the new plates of scallops which were just as salty as the first plates but we decided we'd deal with it. After all, what's a little bloating? They were cooked perfectly but again, too salty and about every other bite we encountered sand? You know when you bite into a scallop and it's like you bit into small bits of glass or sand? Maybe they weren't washed thoroughly? Not much fun anticipating that in your bites. It's too bad because otherwise, it would have been a great dish, minus the salt and sand. I felt a little bit of attitude from the waitstaff, probably because we had the same complaint twice, but he was nice enough to comp us dessert for not being completely happy with our entrees, and i will say, it is arguably one of the best creme brulees in the world. Oh, and the bread....that was also another highlight. Loved the onion focaccia and nut/date bread. Overall it was fun to try it out."

Chef Eric sent out an amuse bouche of green juice with lime foam, compressed cantaloupe melon and a new signature cocktail made with Pimm's, Pavan (a liqueur made from the Muscat grape and a touch of orange blossom in the South of France) and cucumber bitters topped with a cucumber garnish -- YUM!   If the goal was to amuse the mouth and invigorate the palate, it worked!  Next came a medley of tuna sashimi on homemade rice paper with a seaweed salad and Padron pepper, perfectly prepared and presented -- served with a Sauvignon Blanc from Canterbury, New Zealand.  Next came a whimsical beet dish served on homemade yoghurt and paired with a Gruner Veltliner, Wolfgang's favorite wine from Austria.  Mike, our most excellent waiter, told us that the next dish was \"surf and turf\" -- special extra extra thick bacon and jumbo prawn on a whisky reduction sauce.  The absolute BOMB!  This was paired with a Dr. Thanisch Bernkasteler Doctor Riesling Kabinett, the saltiness of the bacon and the subtle sweetness of the wine went well together.  Next we had the house made pasta (spaghetti) with New Zealand truffles, that are in season now, and imported butter accompanied by a Chris Blanchard made Chardonnay.  The pairing was spot on, as were the others!  Next we were served the red snapper served on a sea of vegetables with the Irony Pinot Noir from Monterrey!  That dish was off the charts perfect, with hot moist fish, crunchy vegetables in a perfect mix of flavor and textures.  Most people would have served a white wine with the fish, but the Pinot Noir worked!  For the protein course we were served slices of duck with a crispy outside and soft inside, cooked medium, served on pureed sweet corn and accompanied by a glass of Rioja Reserva (Tempranillo).  At this point they brought the most amazing intermezzo:  house made pana cotta with fresh berries and lemon sorbet. That was the creamiest panna cotta I have ever tasted.  Dessert consisted of a chocolate beignet, homemade cherry ice cream made with dark sweet cherries from Oregon, homemade marshmallows and one of those fancy French macaroons paired with Taylor Fladgate Port.  Lukas, the General Manager, checked in from time to time to be sure that everything was up to standards and it was over-the-top for us, above and beyond any expectation that we had before we experienced it.  Outstanding service was provided by Mike and Eduardo and the rest of the team.  Each course was presented and described to a tee.  Any questions that we had, and there were many, were answered fully.   What I remember of the descriptions after a three-hour feast, are what I have shared here.   I do not have a menu to consult for the names and descriptions of each, but you get the idea.  Everything is SPOT ON in this restaurant:  the ambiance, the service, the food, the wine, the serving temperature of the wine,  the seating, the music -- they get everything right.  And the price suits the quality of the experience!  When you're in Vegas, be sure to plan a stop at Spago, you will love it too! Thank you Lukas and crew for a most memorable evening at Spago!"

Spago has superlative service without compromising on the quality of food--no mean feat given the curious mix of patrons one might see in any Vegas joint--an odd subset of world population indulging in undocumented excesses with impunity, even if only briefly.\n\nI was seated within minutes of getting to Spago, and the friendly server was as tactful in making menu recommendations as he was in engaging in small talk with me.  The chopped vegetable salad was excellent, especially if you like your salad chopped finely.  I also tried the Valrhona chocolate dessert--well executed and presented.  Their teas are served in glass kettles--a welcome improvement over steel ones with too-hot-to-the-touch handles.\n\nIf I find myself in Vegas again, I will be sure to return.  But in the meantime, I would have to settle for the sub-par salad options in New York."

The entire staff was very friendly and accommodating, we had split checks, split orders, rushed orders, flashing pictures every 2 minutes, I'm sure we were being rowdy at some point, basically a server's nightmare. But it was smiles and complements all around, not a single dirty look, in fact we were encouraged to get louder. \n\nEveryone had a great experience and unanimously agreed that the food was incredible. I had the grilled octopus salad, and lamb with wild mushroom risotto. The BEST risotto EVER! I wanted to get naked and take a bath in that silky luscious creamy goodness!!! The lamb was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and worked so well with goat cheese! My friends who had the butternut squash soup, short ribs and gnocchi all raved about it, I think we were just about 1 short of licking the bowls... ;)\n\nPS - We thought Spago is close since the Forum shops are \"just across the street\" and decided to walk there. No, Spago is like a 15 minute hike from the entrance by Joe's, not a fun hike in 4\" heels... should've taken the underground cab entrance which is right downstairs."

They were professional and knew when to hold conversation with us and when to leave us to ourselves.\n\nThey started our food procession with a tomato bisque taster and a variety of excellent breads.  We chose to split the octopus salad which was very flavorful!  Entrees of lamb for both of us were also excellent.  Dessert choices were peanut butter souffl\u00e9 and a chocolate dessert which I can't remember the name.  Interestingly, combining the two in each bite was delicious (think Reese peanut butter cups, yum).  Our server mentioned asking for chocolate chip mint ice cream with the peanut butter souffl\u00e9 is another good way to go.\n\nOnly observations of non 5 star accolades was the fairly loud background noise of the mall (seems out of place for such a nice restaurant).  And another concern, while the decor and artwork is nice, you find stacks of chairs on the second floor that seems tacky for such a place.  \n\nIf the adage is true, 'you get what you pay for' then Spago will not disappoint!"

The restaurant is expansive, with a second floor, a bar area and an \"outdoor\" seating area so you can people watch as shoppers walk by.  We were seated on the first floor in a little raised area where we were the first diners of the night to sit there yet still had amazing service.\n\nWolfgang Puck is known for his amazing modern American cuisine and as a treat for ourselves, we went for the Chef's Tasting Menu.  Officially 6 courses, we ended up with what seemed to be 8 courses.  For $95, you get a lot of food while you could end up paying somewhere in the $30s for an entree.  Chef Eric Klein did not disappoint with small portions of his most popular menu items for tasting with some items that weren't available for order on any menu at Spago, lunch or dinner.   \n\nBread: As many reviewers have noted, Spago's bread platter is well known for very good reason.  With four choices that night, sourdough, cranberry walnut, flat bread and foccacia, you could not go wrong with any.  Dipping platter:  Olive oil infused with rosemary, salt, pepper and butter.  The bread was very good as advertised, something that I tried to pace myself with knowing that I had the tasting menu to come.\n\nAmuse Bouche: Duo of AMERICAN KOBE BEEF \"SLIDERS\" Brioche Buns, Bread-Butter Pickles, Red Onions, Smoked Gouda, House Made Ketchup, CHILLED MARYLAND BLUE CRAB SALAD Fragrant Herbs, Avocado, Grapefruit Segments, Lemon Vinaigrette and Basil Pistou\n-Melt in your mouth Kobe beef, a perfect bite with the pickles providing just enough tang but the Crab Salad was what stole the show.  The Grapefruit and lemon vinaigrette was unbeatable in cutting through the richness of the crab salad.  Amazing bite\n\nFirst Course: MARGARITA FLAMBE: Mozzarella, Fontina, Parmesan, Goat Cheese with Garden Tomatoes and Basil\n-Crispy and flaky crust with an intense tomato flavor.  the flambe was good, something that didn't stand out too much at the end of the dinner, great contrast between the crust and the flavor of the toppings\n\nSecond Course: DUO of Yellowfin Tuna Sashimi: Watercress Salad, Lychee, Chive and Aji Limon and Avocado, Daikon Radish, Scallion and Yuzu-Wasabi\n-Served in a perfect ice sculpture, the presentation was dramatic.  Each sashimi bite had incredibly fresh seafood, the tuna being highlighted by the lychee and  by the yuzu, very yummy flavorful punches\n\nThird Course: Soup/Salad: FARMERS' MARKET CAULIFLOWER SOUP\nTrumpet Royale Mushrooms, Arugula and Basil Oil OLSEN FARM'S BABY ARUGULA SALAD Farmers' Market Apple, Shaved Fennel, Burrata Cheese, Prosciutto San Daniele, Ice Wine Vinegar and Olive Oil\n-The soup was very creamy, had hints of potato but was made with pureed cauliflower, the arugula and basil oil was a great way to cut through the creaminess, very yummy with a great balanced salad.  The apple, fennel and cheese were complimented by the ice wine.  Overall, great course\n\nFourth Course: Hand Rolled, ricotta Gnocchi with porrcini mushrooms, black truffle butter, cheese foam,\nTHE BEST COURSE OF THE NIGHT! There is no way to describe the pillowy, fluffy gnocchi, this course is not available anywhere on the menu day or night, it can only be had through the tasting menu.  The heartiness of the mushrooms with the black truffle butter, was insanely delicious, I could eat this dish every day for a long time\n\nFifth Course: GRILLED FRENCH SEA BASS LOUP DE MER: Artichokes, Baby Carrots, Haricot Vert, Cipollini, Arugula, Fennel Pur\u00e9e, Artichokes Barigoule Broth Au Pistou\n-Perfectly cooked fish, flaky with a crispy crust.  The broth was something that could've been drunk without any accompaniment, very tasty and the accompanying vegetables were great for the fish.\n\nSixth Course: MESQUITE GRILLED PRIME FILET MIGNON: Sweet & Sour Red Onions, Celery, Watercress, Bone Marrow Crushed Fingerling Potatoes and Armagnac Peppercorn Sauce PISTACHIO CRUSTED COLORADO LAMB CHOPS\nCheese on top of the lamb, pickled beets and onions with balsamic reduction\n-The lamb was tender, with the peppercorn flavor coming right through and the filet mignon was tender and tasty.  After all the big bold flavors in the past courses, the meat course was a little lacking but still very tasty if I had just had that course.  I was still hooked on that gnocchi.\n\nPalate Cleanser: Blood Orange and Passionfruit Sorbet over blueberries\n-Yummy sorbet that had a touch of bitterness that did its job, cleanse your palate after that long meal.  I ate the whole thing, def not just a palate cleanser\n\nDesert: CREPE: Dark Chocolate, hazelnut, creme fraiche with orange glaze\n-Great crepe, with just enough body in the crepe to balance the hazelnute and dark chocolate\n\nOverall, great attentive service, great food, was greeted by Eric Klein himself, would do it again in a heartbeat if I had unlimited funds, well worth the money"

This new Vegas trend I found impractical for larger parties. \n\nOne of the highlights of the meals was their bread basket. They come around with an assortment of about five breads that are all quite good- I especially enjoyed the cheesy bread as well as the crispy parmesan cracker. \n\nThe menu itself is divided into three seconds, One being appetizers, Two pastas, and Three entrees. My fiancee and I chose one from each. \nThe Mushroom Soup was the most impressive of the three dishes. I loved the fluffy wild mushrooms atop the delicious lightly creamy soup.\nOur saffron Risotto dish with scallop, crab, and chorizo sounded amazing on the menu but didn't quite deliver. The scallop was plopped in the middle of creamy risotto, but the risotto itself tasted plain and did not encompass the flavors of the seafood and meat. \nThe Cabio, which was described as akin to swordfish, was a hearty dish, but also lacking in taste and failed to leave us with a positive impression."

Yet, on my first night there, while walking around by myself contemplating options, I ended up settling on Spago.  \n\nThe Los Angeles iteration of this restaurant is very upscale, long considered a Hollywood hotspot.  While the Las Vegas version features an upscale option, it is a little less stuffy than LA's Spago.  Being by myself, I opted to sit at the bar, which was the right move.\n\nThe bartender was fantastic: fast, friendly and serving ambrosial drinks.  I loved that the drink menu was visible on an iPad, making the convenience of selecting a drink that looked delectable a simple endeavor.  The drink itself was delicious, one of the best I had in Las Vegas and in the past few months period.  Topping that off, it was cheaper than the average mixed drink at even a casino bar, and of much higher quality.  For my meal, I ordered a Pasta Carbonara with added chicken.  The chicken was so sapid and juicy.  Meanwhile the pasta was creamy and perfectly al dente.\n\nAll-in-all, I was pleasantly amazed to find that this turned out to be my most memorable meal during my last stay in Vegas.

We ordered a calamari appetizer and a margherita pizza to share. Both were wonderful, with the calamari coming with a delicious sweet and spicy sauce. \n\nAlso they give you an assortment of bread before your meal comes out, and it's not just that wimpy little bread and butter crap. This was some fancy shiz. There were three different types with their own sauces, including sweet bread, with raisins or cranberry baked into it and topped with butter. Also a different type topped with olive oil, etc. Good stuff.\n\nThe pizza was delicious as well, with nice sharp cheeses and plenty to go around. The crust wasn't amazing but I was far from complaining.\n\nSomehow we managed to get out of here for $35 bucks. \n\nI would give 5 stars but didnt' try enough of the dishes, and like I said the pizza wasn't exactly perfect, but seriously i doubt you could do much better at Caesars for the price.  Had a giftcard to another Wolfgang Puck restaurant the following day (we didn't mean to go to two of his places, but that's how it worked out), and it wasn't nearly as good and cost twice as much."

My husband ordered some saki and a Sapporo and the bartender gave us some tips on different saki's and other Japanese beers.  \n\nWe went to our table by the friendly host and were immediately greeted by our server.  He gave us a rundown of the menu and what some of his favorites were.  We decided on doing the tasting menu prepared by the chef, specific for that night.  That was the best idea because we were able to try a bunch of things that were on the menu and a few others that were not.  We were stuffed by the time we got to the 4th course and we still had 2 more to go!  The first course was flat bread with cheese, prosciutto, balsamic vinaigrette, and something sweet (amazing!).  The next course was a sushi plate - one of the pieces was a piece of tuna on a rice cake with some sort of sauce.  Very yummy!!!  Next was pasta - gnocci with a cream, pepper sauce.  BEST GNOCCI I've ever had.  The fish course was a halibut with jasmine rice, a honey flavored sauce, veggies, and huckleberries.  The halibut was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  The meat course was duck, which made me nervous, but it was cooked perfect with a DELISHIOUS sauce.  The flat bread pizza, gnocchi, and halibut were by far my favorite courses.  The dessert was TO DIE FOR - homemade cheese cake with grapefruit sorbet and on the other side of the plate was bananas with cream fresh, pistachio nuts, drizzled with Nuttella.  The chef came out and greeted us after every course to ask us what we thought.  \n\nIf you're ever in Las Vegas and are looking for a great experience and fantastic food - go to Spago!  After this review I want to go back now!"

The food is consistently great (most recently, I had an amazing steak quesadilla, a lamb chorizo pizza, and a pink lady apple salad. all of which were exceptional). The service is as impeccable as a restaurant of a certain caliber should be, and best of all for Vegas, there is generally not much of a wait, even at prime meal times and on weekends! They have a great, more inexpensive cafe menu for lunchtime and if you eat on their 'patio' overlooking the Forum Shoppes at Caesars. Such a fan."

The dining room menu has fewer options and the dining room is a bit more upscale. The cafe menu has a lot more options and more casual with faux alfresco dining.  The server offered a sashimi appetizer that I couldn't resist.  So glad I orders it because it was so freaking yummy. It came with a variety of fishes and three delicious dipping sauces. For my entree, I had the jidori chicken. It was served with potato puree and they were able to give me delicious grilled brocollini instead of the normal carrots. The chicken was crispy on the skin side and tender on the inside. The portions were huge, it was half a chicken plus the starch and veggies. Very reasonable prices and great ambiance."

Aiming to try a celebrity chef owned restaurant in Vegas (isn't Vegas all about names and brand?), four of us stumbled upon Spago, a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, after being rejected by Mesa on a Saturday night.  \n\nThe setting is fairly minimalist and modern.  I particularly liked one corner where a giant white chandelier hangs against a simple dark brown wall.  \n\nThe service was really really slow and the waitress was aware of that.  I saw other tables waiting for food for quite a while too, so it wasn't just us. \n\nFood: well, the walnut cherry bread was good which we gnawed on for quite a while waiting for our food to arrive.  We each had 2 oysters.  One I had was really fishy, but the other was okay. \n\nI had the Hong Kong style bass for entree.  I wasn't expecting an authentic piece of fish flying out of a hot wok or anything, but I did hope for something tender and juicy like the name suggests, and there was nothing \"Hong Kong\" about it.  Fish was overdone, and there wasn't much of the umami aroma associated with Hong Kong style steamed fish.  The rice on the side was perhaps better than your average americanized steamed rice, but pretty bad for this price. \n\nmaybe I just didn't order the right thing, since this isn't a Chinese restaurant afterall.  However, the others didn't love their dishes either.  I don't remember much other than they were a duck dish, a pasta dish and a lamb dish. \n\nNothing really stood out, and maybe that was why we were able to get a table without reservation on a Saturday night."

Raspberry puree with lime juice and seltzer. so refreshing!\n\nFor starters I had a small Thai chicken salad that was a mish-mash of all sorts of itty bitty ingredients including some flowers, it too was fresh tasting, and the chicken was moist as well. very pleased. \n\nThen i had the margherita pizza to go. It was good, but the dough was a little thicker than what i'm used to, but still really very good. \n\nThen later the same night, I had a big dinner with 10 from work. It was a great evening. The staff was really great, they helped out with one gluten free eater. This waiter was on his game. he was really truly wonderful and the meals were really very good. \n\nthe top dishes were the red snapper, the pizzas, the braised short ribs with homemade gnocchi, and the desserts were pretty good too. the earl grey ice cream knocked me off my feet.

Everyone was very attentive to all of our needs.  I love when a waiter or waitress anticipates your needs.  Water is low, appetizer is close to done, beer is almost gone... at Spago, they are on it!  Our water was never low, one appetizers was brought as another was finishing up, and our beer didn't get below half before someone asked if we need another.\nA delicious variety bread basket was brought to our table prior to our appetizers coming out.  A dish with olive oil, butter, and sea salt accompanied the bread.\nWe ordered the Kobe sliders and the crab cakes as appetizers.  Oh my gosh, really!?!  They were so delicious!!!  The beef sliders came on the cutest tiny buns.  The flavor was robust and savory.  The sliders were served with a delicious aioli and some micro greens.  Perfection. \nThe crab cakes were AMAZING!!!!  The filler of the crab cake was... well, crab.  A thick, juicy succulent crab cake adorned with a delicious lemon aioli.  Simple and delicious!

I came here for a friends birthday party. There were 14 of us and 8 of the group opted for the 6 course meal ($100pp) and the rest of us ordered a la carte. \nOddly, the 6 course meal was really most of what's on the menu, just tiny portions.\nOne thing that I loved was the bread service. They offer soft butter topped with sea salt to accompany the various breads. That was so good. I liked the cherry walnut bread best.\nI ordered the seabass with sauteed vegetables. Anyone who knows me knows I loooooove seabass and loooooove veggies.....however, this was just eh. I didn't even finish! I've never ever NOT finished a seabass meal, or veggie meal for that matter. It just didn't do it for me. The fish was flat and the veggies were.......eh...shoulder shrugs. And not for nothing, for $40, I should have LOVED my dinner.\nI had 2 pineapple ginger mojitos'. Those were good, not great, but good. My friend ordered some weird bourbon drink that was actually very tasty. (I dont like bourbon, but I do seem to enjoy his drinks when I taste them).\nMaybe it's what I ordered (doubt it), but I wasn't impressed. \nThey offered some pistachio and raspberry \"tarts\" at the end of dinner and they were NOT good. The raspberry was SO overpowering. I did like the homemade carmels that accompanied Arvins' bday dessert. \nThe company was awesome, I had a great time. I just wasn't a fan of my food, and let's face it, that pretty important. So 5 stars for the company (as always), 2 stars for the food and 4 stars for service! So, we will be nice and give 3 stars."

Alas, I chose Spago.\n\nDining alone, I was offered a seat at the very outer rail affording great people watching.  The wait was very brief which was a surprise as the restaurant was very busy and I did not have a reservation; welcoming staff that even went as far as to correct my disheveled lapel.\n\nOn the patio, the seating is a bit crowded for egress and passage, but ample for movement.  I chose the Soup du Jour and Cascerecci Pasta \u00e0 la Bolognaise as an entr\u00e9e.  The soup texture was rather thick, and hot but very, very flavorful; spicy a bit.  I do not recommend this to everyone, yet those that enjoy a bit of \"heat\" and a flavor reminiscent of Jambalaya will be very satisfied.  The Cascerecci Pasta \u00e0 la Bolognaise was very good - not outstanding, but very good.  The sauce didn't bore or excite and the pasta was cooked just right, but didn't \"wow.\"  I didn't catch the Garlic, I did however, enjoy the Braised Beef - and the Ricotta Cheese was most pronounced and flavorful of all with each mouthful.\n\nI'm very satisfied with dinner and actually can think of no detractions.  I suppose it's rare to dine and the venue hit a mark where you are without comment beyond a great meal without incident.  I must say the view, a meal that meets exact expectations, and a dialed in professional staff is a surprise.\n\nA new standby has been located as the culinary fare is predictable and the view is worth every dollar."

            "review": "Came here for lunch last Sunday with a reservation just because it is a smaller location. It was alright but for the pricing, it wasn't anything crazy good. Unless you're coming here for pizza, I'd rather go to Mesa Grill or Cheesecake Factory. Also one thing I really hated, was the fact that it wasn't too busy but everything took FOREVER! A quick lunch ended up being 2 1/2 hours! We would have ordered dessert but we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for that.\nFor appetizer we had the Prime Beef Sliders. The flavor was really delicious and the beef was really tender but oh my goodness, these are the smallest sliders I've had in my life. Their height was the length of my thumb and was as big around as a silver dollar. Also, their baby portion of fries was good but again, the portion was hilarious. I think these were about $16? Not worth it.\nMy boyfriend had the chicken sausage pizza and sure the portion was great but that's because it's a pizza. The flavor was good, but you could get the same at Settebello or CPK. They also served it with Pasilla peppers on top.\nI had the Atlantic Salmon. Salmon was cooked perfectly but their pairing with the curried califlower didn't match in my opinion. Nothing memorable for this dish either and I believe the pricing was about $28.\nHonestly, if everything had been about $5 cheaper, they would maybe get 4 stars because nothing was really wrong with anything we ate but everything we tried, we could get somewhere else with better flavor, more reasonable pricing, and it wouldn't have taken 2 1/2 hours. Sorry Spago, this one was a miss for me. I would defintiely recommend Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill for a lunch option at Caesar's instead."

Everything was great, in particular the chicken.  The bread was also delicious - I would recommend trying one of each and maybe even going back for seconds (especially if you get the soup - the breads were great for dipping!)\n\nThe service here was decent, but not great, which was surprising given that the restaurant was only ~75% full.  There were a lot of kids/families which took away from what we thought would be a more upscale dinner. Also we were originally seated at a booth where the table was abnormally high up and the foot space very narrow.  We were able to switch to a 'normal' table which was much better. We saw another couple go through the same process later in the evening. So be warned, definitely do not sit at these booths - the restaurant should really think about replacing them."

We were able to be seated immediately for a late breakfast/ early lunch and opted for that versus waiting in line for a buffet or getting a quick bite elsewhere. \n\nService is always great here and today was no exception. They offer half portions for lunch and I opted for a half portion of spaghettini arrabiatta while the wife chose the Atlantic salmon. Everything was great and the wife could not remember when she had a better salmon dish. \n\nThe prices are a little high, but you can get a 10% discount by showing your total rewards card. All in all, Spago offers great food from pizzas to pastas, fish and everything else in between. Also you can people watch as they stroll through the forum shoppes looking to buy some fancy clothes, shoes or purses."

The famous Spago's restaurant was always talked about and seemed to be the rage amongst all the experts.  Well after all the times I've been to Vegas, i think it's about time I tried it.  It didn't disappoint either.\n\nThe Vegas restaurant has two sides to it, the dining section and the cafe.  Cafe side as you can imagine is of lesser fare and more wallet friendly.  However the dining section is where the true meals are at.\n\nThe Mozzarella appetizer was perfect to whet our appetites even more for the main courses.  It was seasoned perfectly with fresh tomatoes and wasn't too heavy on the oil, vinegar, or the basil.  Plus the presentation was good as well.\n\nThe main courses were equally as good.  The grilled ahi was seasoned with the right amount of sesame, and the outer edge was seared just right to give it a hearty meaty texture.  The freshness of the raw part was really enhanced because of this.  The lamb chop I had was cooked to a perfect medium rare and had a wonderful marble glaze on it that didn't require me to have any mint jelly with it.  The gaminess and wild flavor of the lamb wasn't over powering as well and fused with the glaze and seasonings to give a burst of flavor with every bite.\n\nWe were quite please with our experience here as the service was very attentive and pleasant.  Reservation are recommended for the dining room section, although you might get lucky and get someones canceled table if you do a drop in."

I asked about the 6 course tasting menu and my server described the courses.  When he knew I had a show at 7:30, he thought I might not have enough time for the meal.  The he said, \"We'll make it happen.  We'll move things along.\"  The meat course was the only course in which I had a choice.  You could choose either a filet or a lamb chop. \n\nIn a few minutes, Michael brought a tray with four kinds of bread--cheese dusted lavash, cheddar bacon rolls, mini baguettes, and a cherry walnut bread.  I asked for some lavash and the bacon cheddar roll.  I didn't want to fill up on bread.  Note:  with the bread, they serve butter with ground salt on top (hooray!)\n\nThe first course was a seafood course.  There were four compartments on the dish and each one had a small portion of a different fish.  The small spoon had crab, to the right there was some tuna, above on the right was a carpaccio of octopus and to the upper left was albacore tataki.  Each had seasonings including an avocado pur\u00e9e on one, a small piece of melon with another and so on.  Great presentation.  Wonderful flavors!\n\nCourse 2 was the salad course.  There were two parts to this.  One was a small cup of warm tomato soup that was superb.  I asked Michael if it was on the menu, but it's not.  It really was tasty.  Along with the soup was a salad consisting of a wedge of yellow and red tomato.  It's been a long time since I had tomatoes with so much flesh and almost no seed.  There were 3 or 4 green beans lying diagonally across the tomatoes and there were some small cherry tomatoes and some more avocado pur\u00e9e.  Very light and lots of summer flavor.\n\nCourse 3 was the first fish course.  A bottom layer had a polenta flan.  On this was the grilled eel and on top of the eel was a fried quail egg.  The dish was decorated with some tasty cheese tuile.  The eel was moist and soft and fell apart with just a touch.  It was perfectly cooked!\n\nCourse 4 was the pasta course.  It consisted of agnolotti that was topped with pieces of lobster meat and there was some basil olive oil drizzled around the base of the pasta.  This was excellent also!\n\nCourse 5 was a second fish course--sea bass.  The bass was placed on a layer of what appeared to be thin pasta.  After delving deeper, I found that they were extremely thin, narrow slices of yellow and green squash that could have easily been mistaken for pasta until you tasted them.  Very clever execution and very tasty sea bass.  There was also a piece of melon and a grilled cherry tomato.  You can see how the chef likes to mix contrasting flavors.\n\nCourse 6 was the meat course and I chose the lamb chop (rare).  It was an herb crusted chop that had been removed from the chop with the bone left there to chew on when the main part was gone. There was some pea pur\u00e9e and some more basil oil.  It was truly superb!\n\nFor dessert, I first got a plate with three sorbets--blackberry, mango, and raspberry--and there was an extremely thin piece of white chocolate placed in the mango.  It was so delicate it almost melted when I picked it up.  Then I was brought a pretty plate with grasshopper cheesecake and some house made mint ice cream with chocolate flecked throughout.  There were also some chocolate decorations, a loop and a rod that were very good.  Last, I was brought 2 mignardises.  One was a watermelon jelly candy and the other one I think was marshmallow but I may be wrong.\n\nHuge thanks to a great serving crew--Michael, my server, a young woman who was a busser in my area and had a wonderful personality, and the runners from the kitchen who explained each course beautifully.  It's too bad it wasn't recorded so I got more things correct in this review.\n\nMichael took my credit card as time got short and I left the restaurant about 10 minutes before the start of Rod Stewart.  They did an outstanding job of moving the courses along and I was in my seat with 5 minutes to spare.\n\nI have to come back in another season when the dishes are different and do the tasting again and take more time to savor each course.  I don't know why I overlooked Spago for so long!!"

Honestly, we walked to White Castle afterwards for some \"fillers\" (fries, onion rings, and what they're calling a burger). \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I had the beet salad off the summer menu, which was super good. Though, I expected there would be more beets. I tasted more tomatoes than beets. For my entree, I went with the special: lobster risotto. This was to die for! It wasn't drenched in cheese. There were large chunks of lobster! Real lobster! I just wish they served a larger portion. I devoured my meal. Unfortunately, I was still hungry. They do give you bread to start, which comes with a tasty olive oil. However, I avoid the bread at the table at all restaurants.  \n\nMy girlfriends went with the pork belly appetizer and the salmon for the entree. They also enjoyed their meals but were still hungry afterwards. We were really hungry because we had not eaten all day, and just came back from a hiking trip. Perhaps this wasn't the place we should have picked for our first meal. We were trying to go to the buffet, but we couldn't wait 2 more hours to eat. We were already HANGRY! \n\nThe service here good for the most part, however, it was a little slow. But when you're hungry, anything feels like forever. They also allowed us to dine here in our workout clothing. We didn't have to dress up so that was a plus. It was probably bad for those who came here for fine dining to see us in our exercise wear."

A first bite confirmed that it tasted delicious, too. I especially enjoyed the way that the plentiful pork carnitas got crispy on the bottom of the skillet. But every ingredient here worked perfectly together, and I honestly can't recall a hash I've enjoyed eating more.\n\nWe also ordered a couple of cocktails, and they too were pretty much perfect."

We opted for the fine dining since it was date night. \n\nthe different kind of bread that we had while we waited for our dishes were very good. there was 4 kind and i took one of each. the cranberry walnut, some cheese bread, an apple bite bread and this swirly plain bread. the bread was cold. wish it was warm a little but its ok. \n\nwe also got a complementary amouse bouche. it was ginger squash soup. very tasty and a slight ginger kick to it. \n\nwe decided to order the lamb loin(medium rare, chefs recommendation) it was perfect! OMG it was mouthwatering and didn't have that stinky lamb smell. it tasted like beef to me. \n\nthe other dish we ordered was the sea bass. the skin was a little too salty for me. i think even my bf thought so too. came with shitake mushroom, apples and brussels sprouts. the sauce that it came with complimented the fish very well. \n\nfor complementary house desserts. we had the raspberry marshmallow and this other chocolate tart thing. both was made very good. was not too sweet as american desserts are known for."

We were treated to a four-course meal as well as several trays of appetizers and an open bar. \n\nWhile the room doesn't have much in the way of decor, it was spacious and provided a quiet spot away from the hustle of Vegas to mix and mingle with the 40 to 50 guests of the wedding. \n\nI'm a self-proclaimed picky eater and skipped the passed appetizers, which included spring rolls, crab cakes, lamb, mushroom and goat cheese flatbread and calamari and shrimp flatbread, but my boyfriend liked the mushroom flatbread. Honestly though, it's a good thing that the appetizer selection didn't appeal to me because I was stuffed after the four-course dinner. \n\nJust a reminder, all of our food was selected off the private dining/catering menu and not the regular restaurant menu. \n\nFirst, we started with a Green Goddess Salad, which included butter lettuce with avocado and green goddess dressing. I'm not sure what green goddess dressing is exactly but it's delicious and I may have to look for a similar type of dressing to use at home. So good! \n\nOur second course was gnocchetti with beef bolognese sauce. While I'm not typically a fan of ground beef in my sauce, I was able to push the larger chunks aside and the gnocchi was wonderful. My boyfriend, who is a vegetarian, was able to get a non-meat sauce with his. If I had been thinking more clearly, which alas I was not due to the open bar, I would have requested the same. \n\nThe main course offered a choice of scallops or New York steak. I chose the steak and boy was that a great decision! The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and had great flavor. The little potatoes that it's served with were also wonderful and I was very appreciative that the waiter was able to serve my plate without bacon as I haven't eaten pork since I was 10 years old. \n\nFinally, we ended the meal with a caramel cheesecake, topped with a scoop of coffee ice cream. I'm strange, I know, but I can't stand the taste of coffee and the ice cream ruined the cheesecake for me. But I was already so full that I wouldn't have had room for it anyway. \n\nAll in all, despite my fancy food reservations, it was a great night filled with great food and service and I'd recommend giving Spago a chance for your next big event. I looked it up online and they have quite an extensive list of choices for the courses so you can make your own menu,"

Like I said, this is the kind of place where you leave FULL but want to continue eating simply because everything you are was so delicious. Don't even get me started on the dessert. I didn't want to order one but hubby convinced me. I can't remember what it was called but basically it was an ice cream cookie dough concoction that was truly five star quality. Soooo good! I usually don't order desserts but this was exceptional. I would have ordered my own except we were running late for a show so were a little late on time. Bottom line, this was a great last minute find that we thoroughly enjoyed. We sat at the bar and our bartender, Emily, was super helpful and friendly. We would definitely come back!!"

We put our names down(without reservation, and on am evening, I can understand that there can be a wait). The hostess said we'd only wait 20 minutes, so we walked around the Forum. After, we came back but our table still wasn't ready. We went to the bar and had overpriced, weak, and too sweet mojitos. My dad kept trying to nicely ask the hostess if she knew when our table would be ready, as we saw many open tables and other groups being promptly seated (he didn't mention that, though, because he isn't rude). However, she was very short with him and would keep making a point to not walk near us. \n\nAlso, I went to the bathroom at some point, and the other hostess who came in opened the door quite briskly and almost hit me hard. She kept walking by me without any apology or acknowledgement. Overall, the hostesses seemed much more stuck-up than they needed to be. \n\nOur waiter was really nice, but the busboys were rude. One poured water without thinking and spilled water on our Canon camera. He also took away my mom's drink when she was only halfway done with it. We did mention this to our waiter who felt terrible and got her a new one for free.\n\nAgain, the saving grace here was the food. The pizza is out of this world. The Chinese chicken salad was incredible - huge portion but maybe could have used more greens. The pasta sauces were flavorful. Even the bread loaf given to us was fresh.\n\nHowever, I really wasn't comfortable due to the service. We may have been tourists, but we weren't obnoxious or tacky. We were dressed quite nicely too. We spent good money there and could have been treated better."

Well that was also the last time I visited Spago.  It was for lunch on their \"outdoor\" patio cafe.  To me, at the time, that was one of the most lavish lunches I ever had but it didn't really WOW me.  I always thought I'd always go back to visit Spago, but I'm almost surprised that it took me 7 years to finally go back.\n\nIt was just my luck that Spago was celebrating their 22nd anniversary the week when I was visiting Vegas (http://bit.ly/1z636WC).  For the occasion, they were offering the same original dining room menu with same pricing when first opened (http://bit.ly/1v1CW0P).  I knew I was in for something special since I've never dined inside the main dining room before.\n\nI decided on starting with their Chopped Vegetable Salad, the famous Smoked Salmon Pizza (sans Caviar) for my appetizer, and Wolfgang's Beef Goulash for my Main Course.\n\nChopped Vegetable Salad --  http://bit.ly/1v1D8x4\nw/ Balsamic Vinaigrette and Parmesan\nThis was a good salad to start with.  Well plated, and had a lot of different textures and flavor.  \n\nSmoked Salmon Pizza --  http://bit.ly/1z6t4Ju\nw/ Dill Creme Fraiche & Chives\nI know this is supposed to be their signature pizza, but to me it was just one oversized lox bagel.  Maybe it would've been more better with the caviar which could be added for $10 more.  it was still good, but I should've listened to my server as she advised that this was really meant as shared plate and not for one.  I was already getting full after eating half the pizza, plus I still had my Beef Goulash on the way.  I had the other half boxed up and luckily the nice couple sitting next to me were fans of the pizza, so I gave it to them to take home and enjoy.\n\nWolfgang's Beef Goulash --  http://bit.ly/1z6t9wS\nw/ Sauteed Spatzle, Parsley, Marjoram, Creme Fraiche\nOMFGYUM!  This Beef Goulash was so good!!  I'm so glad I didn't finish that pizza because I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.  The Beef was so tender that you really didn't need knife to cut into it.  It just broke off like butter with my fork  And it was packed with flavor!  I would definitely come back to have this again if they bring it back on their menu.\n\nAfter all that, I was really too full for dessert.  No matter though, overall it was a very solid dining experience.  And with the retro pricing, it was a great deal!  It definitely feels like I've come full circle with Spago, now that I got to experience the dining room side to realize what the big fuss was that I missed back in 2007.  I will definitely come back and a lot sooner than 7 years."

We made a reservation through Opentable for 7pm, but the place was not crowded. You could sit either towards the mall or further inside the restaurant. \n\nA six course tasting menu is available for $95, but we ended up ordering a la carte.\n\nWe received a complimentary amuse bushe of carrot soup from the chef. Mm.. the soup was creamy and had a deep carrot flavor.\n\nThe bread is outstanding! A server walks to your table and shows you a tray of bread. Wow.. it's a bread galore for carb lovers. I ended up getting one of everything since I wanted to try it all! I love the flatbread since it is so crispy. \n\nFor the appetizer, we ordered the Trio of Tuna. This dish is highly recommended if you love sashimi! Wow! The tuna was extremely fresh and each one had a great flavor. YUM! I could have ordered two of these appetizers. You can easily share this appetizer with another person as each type of tuna came with two pieces. The dish had the following tuna:  1) Hamachi 2) Yellowfin sashimi 3) Big Eye Tuna Tartare \n\nMy hubby ordered the Roasted Half Free Range Organic Chicken with goat cheese stuffed underneath the skin, wild mushrooms, and potatoes. He never orders chicken at a restaurant, but he missed eating chicken during the Vegas trip! He said that this is one of the best chicken dishes that he has eaten. He loved the chicken dish since skin was crispy and had goat cheese stuffed under the skin. The portion was generous!\n\nI ordered the Pan Seared Duck Breast with morel mushrooms, peas, carrots, glazed cherries. The duck breast was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was delicious. I wish the portion size was a larger for the price since the chicken dish was huge.\n\nService was very attentive.

The vegetables and sauces complemented the dish so well. I would come back again to order this dish.\n\nPork Chop the Day's Special cooked Medium: The pork was cooked perfect and juicy. Nicely flavored. The boyfriend ordered this dish, and his plate looked like it was locked clean, nothing left but the bone. \n\nFrench Seabass: This was the second dish the server recommended. The fish was season perfectly with a hint of lemon.

I don't usually send back food, but everyone at the table said I should, as the dish was expensive and should be prepared to my specifications. After letting one of our servers know, a new dish came out 15 minutes later served to me by the manager and several staff. They were sincerely sorry and wished me Happy Birthday.

We had an amazing Sashimi that was served on a bed of seaweed with dry ice making the salt smell...oh yeah....\n\nsorry I had a moment. \n\nMustard and cantaloupe...those shouldnt go together, I can't stop thinking about it. It was with the sashimi....\n\n\nSorry. Moment. \n\nThen there was a cold soup soup/salad that redifined tomato for me forever....and then crab salad, and risotto with truffle and parmesan, and then halibut and peppers with a carrot puree, and then lamb with a different carrot puree.....and...oi...Did I mention this was October 10th? I remember what I ate down to the texture of each berry slice.\n\nFood came at a perfect pace, we had enough time to eat slowly and savor an unusual meal, without feeling like \"man, where is the next course!?\" Everything was presented so elegantly and with such grace I almost felt too plebian to be eating this food...but the staff was so warm and welcoming, I also felt like I was almost a regular. They clearly knew the night was special for us, and god, it felt like it. \n\nI forgot about the money, I forgot about what we were doing after, I forgot about brain scans, and scary doctor visits, and I just thought about how most amazing the tomatoes were -even in comparison to heirlooms straight out of my grandma's garden---I wonder if I brought the chef some unnamed heirlooms from my grandma's garden if he'd cook them---and how spectacular this moment was with my husband...For that alone, 11 stars. 30. Thank you, Spago. For one night of just indulging in flavor and texture and taste....\n\nOn the way to the parking ramp, after rambling about how awesome everything was, my husband remarked \"You know, for that meal, for 9 courses, $100 seems ridiculously affordable.\" And you know what? I agree.\n\nLove you, husband, and you too, Spago."

Everybody was very attentive and accommodating.  We brought our little boy here because we were invited by a good friend and some of his coworkers since we were all at the same conference that weekend. Very thoughtful of them.  Anyway, the staff was extra attentive to our son and really took the time to attend to his needs even though it was really hopping that night.  \n\nFor example, when he was a little fussy and I had to take him outside to walk around a bit, they gladly kept my food under a warmer for the few minutes that I was outside.  \n\nThe food was amazing as expected.  I will reel off a quick list of what we had.\n\nIced Oysters on the Half Shell  with Ginger-Rhubarb Mignonette - Fresh and tasty like the sea.   I believe they were Kumamoto Oysters.\n\nWild Pacific Blue Shrimp - No preservatives here.  Fresh fresh fresh.\n\nSymphony of Tuna - Can't explain all the ways but yum, yum, yum.  \n\nChilled Maryland Blue Crab Salad - A spoonful of goodness. A bit of avocado, grapefruit segments and a lemon vinaigrette along with the crab served in a Ramen type soup spoon.  Wow.\n\nGrilled French Sea Bass Loup De Mer - Crispy skin and cooked perfectly.  The mousseline was nice.\n\nPan Roasted Bone-In Veal Costoletta - Sorry Veal Haters :(  This was very well cooked and despite being under the heat lamp for longer than the chef would have liked I'm sure (read above) it still was cooked very well and was tender as can be.  The risotto was oh so savory.\n\nFrom the words of my party, the Salmon was the best that they have ever had, the Halibut was so good that it resulted in a clean plate, and the Filet was just ridiculous and served with the WGP signature bone marrow.\n\nI love good food and WGP never disappoints.  Many thanks to our good friends for a great meal and next meal is on us."

The Europeans wanted to see Caesars and so we chose Spago for dinner and I made a reservation via OpenTable.  \n\nWe were pleasantly greeted and presented with the option of dining up front with the more casual menu, or in the back and the more formal menu.  We opted for the formal menu.\n\nMy four dinner guests and I enjoyed a variety of entrees and wines by the glass. Our server was knowledgeable and presented everything with a highly professional flair.  The junior server could use a bit more training, but we did not have any issues that was not quickly resolved. \n\nThe food was entirely delicious and the presentation was exquisite.  This is fine dining and what we expected when the reservation was made.  As the host, the pricing seemed appropriate to me for being a high end restaurant with Caesars Palace.  If you have the time for a lengthy, relaxing and delicous dinner, and can get a reservation, you will be well fed at Spago."

I am so mad that it took me this long to eat at a place like Spago, because this was literally one of the best meals I have ever had. \nI use to bartend at Casears, I thought Sapgo was a fine dining, too fancy for my lunch break type of thing! WOW, I was so wrong. You could totally go have lunch in jeans, and not be out of place! \nTwo friends and I sat at the bar. We were greeted immediately and offered drinks. Not only offered, but also offered a Vodka sample tasting to see which Vodka we wanted in our drinks. NICE. I went with an extra dirty martini and I was told by the bartender that he hand stuffed the olives that day. As well as hand cut the big ice chunks. No cutting corners here. \nLet me just tell you that this martini was literally the best I ever had. I usually drink Belvedere but with the tasting, I went with Stoli Elite. Between the high quality Vodka, and cheese, I was in heaven!  \nOur three dishes included salmon, rigatoni Bolognese, and shrimp scampi. The pasta was fresh. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was a better quality than the average. The shrimp were huge. I would order every single dish again. Not to mention the service was so on point! I love when places educate their staff. They know why they use the ice chunks instead of cubes. They know where the salmon came from. They know the answer to just about any question you may have. Including history of the establishment. \nI can't wait to dine here again. They have now set a standard. I look forward to seeing if they hold the bar this high at all times."

We waited at least 10 minutes for him to come over initially, then sat finished for at least 20 before he came back. I asked for salt because my pasta was so bland and you would have thought I had 8 eyes. THREE, I literally mean THREE people came over to verify before I actually got the dish of salt. Once I salted my papperdelle with mushroom sauce it was great. The portions were small, which I love because I didn't feel overly full when I left. The reviews on Yelp were so awesome, and I was left so disappointed."

I had a little bite of everyone and they were all tasty.\n\nI ordered the mushroom tortellini as my entree and it was perfect.  Not too small, or big of an entree- just the perfect amount of pasta one needs for a meal.  I'm a big mushroom fan, and this was a perfect dish for me.  I heard rave reviews from everyone else I was dining with, except one person who ordered some sort of braised beef dish.  But, I'd say 9/10 people happy is pretty freakin' awesome.  Yay Spago!"

I shoulda gotten the kobe beef burger!! the kobe!! but no..what did i end up getting?? the italian sausage pizza. yes. its shameful. kobe burger was on the menu...and i opted for italian sausage pizza. i will never forgive myself. \n\nlet me explain. this was our first stop. i had lack of sleep. we had a heck of a time finding this place bc we kept going around in circles. and i wanted something greasy, meaty, but familiar, but not TOO pricey. hence, the italian sausage pizza. \n\nmind you, it wasn't what i expected. There were circles of italian sausage strewn over the pizza and it looked like slightly thicker and less red versions of pepperoni. Taste: nothing special. plenty greasy though. \n\nThe person next to me got the kobe burger. and proceeded to demolish it with sounds of delight and words of joy. And thats when the regret poured in. \n\nBut enough about my regrets. The oysters looked delicious. (3 for $10, 6 for $20) and the Thai salad my friend got was fresh, crisp, and light. My friend swore by the 'chicken wing lolipops\"...which i thought were just good, but pretty similar to just regular chicken wings.\n\nAll in all, it was a great first stop because i love the Forum Shops and walking around.  the interior was very pretty. And the assortment of breads they give you at the beginning was superb! (get the one with onions on it!!) And I think it was the chef that actually came out and asked how we were doing. service--excellent!! \n\nBut for my particular food choice, and the price...i would select elsewhere. Although, I am willing to give this place another try for the kobe burger. (ok ok, ill stop with the kobe burger)"

The dressing was also tasty. We split the italian sausage pizza and I really liked the thin crust. The pizza was pretty good, but not the best I've had.

Upon seating they give you two menus.  One is a casual menu that offers more of a laid back, typical meal, with large portions and less thought.  The other menu is more expensive, with smaller portions, but offering more creative dishes and chef specialties.  We went with the casual menu, but even that is priced at a high end point.  We had a spaghetti dish with mushroom and a chicken and mashed potato dish.  I can't complain about either.  Both were delicious (maybe not worth the price point) and filling.

Food was good...nobody had anything excellent...except maybe the lobster soup amuse! Bread service comes around and you get to pick your own from a wide variety - always a nice touch. Also they have a pretty decent list of wines under $100. Pretty decor - sort of a dramatic miami vibe. I would not order the pizzas again, the crust was disappointing."

Our waiter came by frequently to make sure we were okay and refill our drinks without asking. The breads were very good, especially the flatbread which I liked a lot. \n\nThe shirmp bisque was fantastic and so tasty. Just a perfect balance of flavor and creaminess. On the other hand the chilled tomato gazpacho with avocado cream just tasted like a big soup bowl of lightly flavored salsa with finely chopped tomatoes. Granted I am not a tomato gazpacho expert but I certainly could not imagine anyone finding this delicious. My Chinese chicken salad was fresh and reasonably tasty but not memorable. I would guess Chinese chicken salad is not their signature dish so I'd be willing to come back and try something else next time.\n\nBottom line: for great service, atmosphere, people watching in the Caesar shops area, this can be a great place. Food is potentially good but inconsistent across dishes (but do try the shrimp bisque!)."

Boy were we pleased with that decision.  \n\nTo start off, I ordered the Sam Smith Nut Brown Ale and my buddy ordered a corona.  They were both poured for us into a very tall glass that was narrow at the bottom and then wider towards the top.  My friend said it was far too nice a glass for a corona ;)  Anyway, I highly recommend the Nut Brown Ale, wherever you can find it.  \n\nBefore the food came out, we sampled their bread.  The Parmesan variety was \"the best restaurant bread\" my buddy had ever had.  The bread fixings included a four-way divided plate full with salt, pepper, olive oil and butter, very nice touch. \n\nOn the to the food.  I ordered the Nebraska Corn-feed Skirt Steak Hunan style.  Wow! It was so good that I twittered about it and was prompted to write this review.  I made a joke that the meat was so good that the cow must have been pampered with a burberry scarf when it was raised.  I had just gone in the burberry store before we were seated (it is next door and no I didn't buy anything - wayyyyy overpriced).  The steak was medium-well and seasoned to perfection.  My plate was adorned with green beans and they were also savory.  Overall this plate almost made me http://www.hulu.com/watch/47604/saturday-night-live-snl-digital-short-j-in-my-pants\n\nProbably wouldn't have eaten here if we didn't have the $140 gift card but since we were able to eat there, I was thoroughly pleased.

I went there for my birthday and ordered the Pad Thai.  Yes I ordered the Pad Thai at Spago and it ended up being the best I ever had.  Coming in I had high expectations. \n\nTo start off, I thought the restaurant is reasonably priced, especially in Vegas.  When we got there it was relatively empty and so we got a table of our choice.  I definitely recommend sitting in the open area so you can watch all the people walk by and it's not as stuffy as the inside.  \n\nWe ordered corn soup, grilled octopus, halibut, and steak.  My friend said the steak was very good and so was my halibut.  The soup and the grilled octopus were also delicious but I think I've had better grilled octopus in other places.  The one downside of the octopus was it had too many beans.  It was mixed in a bed of beans and since I'm not a fan of beans, it all went to waste.  Because the restaurant was relatively empty, the food came out as fast as mickey d's which I wasn't too thrilled about.  When you're having a business dinner and want to be able to chat for as long as possible, it's probably not a good idea to send the food out so quickly.  Also for the price of the restaurant, I thought they would have paced themselves however that didn't happen.  We skipped dessert since we were full so I can't give any comments on it.\n\nI've always wanted to try the Spago at the Forum Shops and I'm glad I did.

They fill you up on bread, but don't waste your space on any other bread besides the focaccia.\n\nDuck breast-  I really like duck but was not impressed with the duck breast.  It was not bad, but not fantastic.\nFilet mignon-  I don't think you can go wrong with steak.  It was pretty good but also just typical tasting.  \nBraised beef short rib-  Extremely tender!!! Many of the girls liked this dish the best, but personally I do not like the texture of very soft beef.  If that's your style, then get this!\nLamb chops-  I am not a huge fan of lamb, but surprisingly this was my favorite dish.  The seasoning complemented the lamb very well and the meat itself was not too gamey.  \n\nAll in all a really nice dinner.

At first look this restaurant looks pretty small but once you go inside, you will realize that they actually have two levels and a relatively large bar. Although the rest of the restaurant looked nice, the restroom looked like it could use some upkeep and was on the dirtier, messier side.\n\nWe ordered the sliders as an appetizer, a chicken sausage pizza for my brother in law, an italian sausage pizza for myself, and a chicken sandwich for my sister. The BEST item here on the menu is the sliders. Delicious, melt in your mouth, and delectable sliders. I would've eaten those as the main entree if I could.\n\nOne star down for the rest of the food. Definitely not bad, but definitely not \"as worth\" coming back for as the sliders. The chicken sandwich breast tasted dry, and neither of the pizzas were memorable. For the three of us with tip, the meal came out to around $90."

            "review": "I came here for a quick lunch with my family before we left to drive back to LA. After doing a little last minute shopping in Caesar's we got hungry and decided to try Spago. We all shared the Chicken Sausage Pizza, their handcut fettuccini with shrimp, a burger, and a plate of their calamari. The prices here were actually pretty decent for Vegas, as were the portion sizes. The pizza was very warm and crispy, but a bit too thin for my liking, as I usually prefer pizzas that are thicker and heavier. I think my favorite dishes of our meal had to be the fettuccini and calamari. The calamari was breaded nicely and chewy like how calamari should be. However, the crowd favorite was definitely the handcut fettuccini. The fettuccini came with 3 fresh pieces of jumbo shrimp served on top a nice warm bed of noodle-like pasta. I say \"noodle-like\" because unlike most pastas, Spago's fettuccini had a texture that was more like the texture of Asian egg noodles.\n\nThe only complaint I had was that in contrary to the what others mentioned in their reviews, my family was not at all offered bread and had to ask both our waiter, and the woman who seemed to be the head waitress, twice for a plate of bread. Not only that, but they didn't serve the bread to us until the rest of our food was out as well."

Both have separate menus but there was a night where you can order from both regardless where you are sitting. The food is always delicious and presented well. The service is usually prompt. When we ate in the fine dining part the specialty of the night was the wagyu which was wow! Melt-in-your-mouth rich goodness. The glazed duck was also very very good. So good that I went back a different day and I got it again.  They also had this pasta that I unfortunately forgot the name of but was very creamy and flavorful. That was a hit too. The salmon was nothing too special similar to other restaurants."

The restaurant is relatively easy to spot because it has a bright neon sign that says Wolfgang Puck's Spago. We arrived to the restaurant with no reservation around 3pm for a late lunch. \n\nWe were seated in their casual cafe dining area because it was lunch time. The dining room is only open for dinner starting at 5:30pm. There is also a nice bar available for casual drinks throughout the entire day starting at 11:30am.\n\nAll dining tables were very clean with comfortable seats, crisp linen table cloths and napkins. We were seated immediately upon arriving because the restaurant wasn't too busy at that time of hour. When seated, one of the waiters welcomed us with the menus and served us with the water of our choice.\n\nWe ordered three things for ourselves:\n(1) Truffled potato chips with maytag blue cheese fondue\n(2) Garlic & Herb marinated roasted free range chicken (hubby)\n(3) Housemade bucatini carbonara with parmesan and crispy prosciutto (me).\n\nOur appetizer arrived sometime later after we ordered, and at first, we weren't too excited about how the potato chips tasted. It didn't WOW either of us, but we both agreed that it was getting addicting as we ate through our plate of chips. The blue cheese fondue was delicious, but we couldn't really taste the truffle in the chips. Topped with some fresh parsley on top, the appetizer was worth trying but it's not something we'd order again. We will try something else next time!\n\nHubby's roasted chicken was delicious. There was no extra side served with the chicken, which hubby actually appreciated because he wanted to eat a little more healthy (ie. no carbs?) for lunch that day. The chicken was full of flavour; it was well marinated and the marinade itself was quite tasty! It was sweet, tangy, and savoury all at the same time, making you reach for seconds and thirds. Hubby loved his dish, and I enjoyed it as well when I tried it; the dish was well balanced in terms of flavour! I'd order a side though to go along with the chicken.\n\nIt was my first time trying bucatini, a thick pasta noodle that has a hole running through its centre. The portion of my carbonara was smaller than I expected, but together with the potato chips, it actually made me so full that I wasn't able to order any dessert. :D Overall, my carbonara was good but not great. The prosciutto on its own was too salty for my taste, but it was balanced when eaten together with the bucatini. The pasta was some what bland without the prosciutto as well. Maybe it was because I had a lot of the blue cheese fondue from my appetizer, but I ended up not really feeling the carbonara. When I ordered it, I was so excited, but after a few bites of my carbonara, I wasn't content with my dish like my hubby was with his chicken. I finished my pasta because I don't like leaving food behind, but the carbonara wasn't anything memorable in my opinion.\n\nAll in all, our lunch at Spago caf\u00e9 was great but nothing incredible. Then again, Spago is more well known for its dining room and dinner service than anything else, so we may give the restaurant another try one day for its dinner. Another reason to visit Las Vegas and the west coast again! :D\n\nThe restaurant is casually recommended, but it's not a must-go in our opinion so far. This may change at one point when we grab dinner at their dining room one day. If you're looking for a casual place to eat for lunch though, Spago would be a great fit overall. It will provide you with good food, great service, and enough energy to get you going on that shopping spree!"

The restaurant is two parts and works well together as a formal restaurant in the back and casual cafe style in the front. \n\nWe ordered the mushroom pizza with brocollini and leeks which was fantastic as well as the classic salad. The classic salad was unique in that it had so many vegetable finely chopped. This could be a great lunch item by itself. Ingredients were very fresh and well presented. \n\nI thought the crust was slightly better at Pizza Fifty in Aria, but the flavor of the pizza here was super. Definitely would go back."

Bartender asked if we were having dinner and I said yes, we got a couple of drinks, and after what seemed like a tad too long we were finally asked about our food order, only after reading other reviews on this place do I now realize that \" the awesome bread basket\" was never offered to us. So we settle in and wait, sipping our drinks and munching on nothing, oblivious to the availability of \"awesome bread\" but at this point we are still happily anticipating the tasty food that is about to come from the chef that says something like \"more chef and less celebrity\" about his operation. Well, out come the oysters, their nice and the ginger rhubarb mignonette sauce is flavorful. Now on to the baby arugula salad, it's some really wilted greens on this slimy lump of tasteless goo called burrata cheese and on top of the goo lump is a lonely slice of prosciutto made inedible by the pile of overdressed \"salad\" placed on top of it. Yech\nI'm still not unhappy though, because my pizza is coming next, yum Wolfgang Puck pizza! I ordered the pepperoni and asked for anchovies on it too. Well, too much cheese and too much pepperoni and not enough time in the oven, along with being placed on a glass plate with no tissue underneath make for a very limp soggy pizza, then to top it off, the anchovies they used were the marinated white variety, delicious for eating as antipasti, but have NO place on a pizza. So now I'm fairly well disappointed and decide against trying anything else on the menu, oh did I mention that none of the dirty dishes were ever removed from the bar, we had to slide em out of the way to make room. I ask for the check and for some reason I looked it over a bit more than usual and notice a misc food charge of 5.00 and realize that's what they wanted for adding maybe 2 fillets of the wrong kind of anchovy to my pizza, keep in mind the whole pizza was 16.00, so this charge of almost 35 percent of the whole pie seems excessive. Now I'm kinda pissed, and I'm not a cheap POS, it just seems wrong so I ask for the manager and explain my concern, I can tell by the way he's looking and reacting to me that he could care less and told him so, all the while getting the \"knee\" from my wife, now it starts getting ugly, I can feel people looking at me causing a scene, and I'm trying to get the manager to just take off the anchovy and add the beer that was mistakenly left off the check which would actually increase my tab by 3.00. Now the manager says he won't accept any money, and this makes me even more angry because I wasn't looking for a damn discount or a comp. So wife's foot is jabbing me harder now and I'm getting really pissed, because now I look like that cheap POS trying to get something for nothing, all I can do is walk out with my tail between my legs as a cheap POS that DID get something for nothing and embarrassed as hell. Lesson learned from this, quit trying \" celebrity chef restaurants\" and so help me I will NEVER make a comment to an owner or manager, I just won't patronize their establishment again. I don't need the grief."

We went there twice on a recent jaunt to LV in July and both times were wonderful! Being vegetarians, it can be quite hard to find \"tasty\" food in Las Vegas, but at Spagos there is no fear for the non meat-eaters! The first night I had hand cut fetuccini with wild mushrooms, arugula, peas etc..honestly it was an example of simple food done perfectly. A truly beautiful meal. \nThe second night, I had a funghi pizza with caramelised onions and porcini mushrooms- definition of NOM. I also tried the BGT pasta, another veggie option of spaghetti in a beautiful tomato and garlic sauce- another spectacular dish. \n\nJust a warning for future diners, eating outside and eating inside are different experiences. Etating outside, watching people strolling by, (I think!?) is meant to be the caf\u00e9 experience, and you get a bread basket to begin with, with a delectable tray of sea salt, rosemary infused olive oil, and rich butter. Inside however, a bit more formal, means you get an amuse-bouche (we had an exquisite leek and potato soup with chive cream drizzle - that stuff was so good, I would have ordered a whole bowl (or trough if they offered) if I could have. ) And instead of a bread basket, a waiter comes round offering bread - making you a bit more aware of looking gluttonous when you ask for more (although the waiters are more than happy to let you indulge!)\n\nOh the bread...the bread! Scrumptious sourdough, ahhh-mazing cherry walnut, flat bread and fresh focaccia - the best carb-fest you could ever have. And dipped into the little accompaniments ..sheer perfection. \n\nOOOOOOH and the desserts! For a dessert lover like me, they were mind-blowing. Earl grey ice cream with chocolate sugar frosted old school dougnuts, served with chocolate and caramel dipping sauce? Or perhaps a trio of creme brulee, mint frozen yoghurt and some other caramel heavenly creamy stuff? mmmmmmmmmmm\n\nFinally, the staff are the epitome of what good waiters and servers should be. The first night (unfortunately, I don't remember the guy's name..I do apologise...he was tall, bald slender, handsome and everso charming!) was the best man that I have ever been waited on. He was funny, charming, made sure everything was okay (but not in that annoying \"lets hover by your table while you eat\",) and he wasn't fishing for tips - a rare thing in many restaurants! Ultimately he made the dining experice, and I am ever so grateful to have had the pleasure of meeting him!\nThe second night, our server was just as polite and courteous, whilst cracking a joke or two, and the bread server was the cutest guy ever ...\ncute guy + scrummy bread = heaven? everyone does their job to the best of their ability, and it does not go unnoticed!\n\nAll hail Spagos, with it's wonderful cuisine, friendly staff and all at a price that cannot be rivalled. :)"

            "review": "Still holding the original Spago as one of those seminal fine dining experiences, a family meal at lunch in 2008 at that time one of the more refined with both service and food showing the sort of quality not found near my Northwest Ohio home, it was finally on the invite of a friend that dinner was served in the Las Vegas location, a nine course and fourteen plate feast showing similarly skilled waitstaff and Chef Eric Klein to be one of the city's most under-discussed talents in the kitchen.\n\nAdmitting up front that although the ingredients served to us were of the same peerless quality as those offered to the rest of the room, it was in to a carte blanche tasting of small-plates that our table was treated with a few crafted 'a la minuit' while the majority at least bore some resemblance to the sizable appetizers and entrees offered on the proper menu.\n\nParticularly impressed by the herbal cocktail at CUT a week prior it was with a similarly infused Indian Notion that the meal commenced, and with Klein now offering his bread at the Downtown Summerlin Farmers Market the rumors of one of the most delicious complimentary offerings in Las Vegas immediately put me on notice that a stop would soon be imminent, the fruit and nut slices as well as the cheese and mustard rolls each amongst the city's very best.\n\nConstrained in time, at least a little, due to a concert beginning at nine it was with a slower-than-usual roll out of lighter items that the tasting got underway, a strong start of off-menu corn custard crowned in caviar alongside a particularly buttery oyster opening the palate to three seafood-centered bites to follow, a freshly shucked urchin as perfect in taste as it was in presentation while the Maine lobster salad was a little lost in all the citrus, the two ribbons of tuna paired to apples and fennel a far more dynamic and balanced pair.\n\nNo doubt benefited by working with Puck's purveyors and his own ties forged at the locals farmer's markets, course four saw Klein sent forth a beautiful heirloom tomato salad deftly tinged with acid and yet as good as the composition was its flavor was quickly supplanted in my memory by the late-season corn soup, a rich and creamy potage finding levity in light froth with topnotes tinged in onions and herbs.\n\nShowing off a bit in the penultimate pair of savories it was with a tableside shaving of black Perigord truffles followed by the season's first from Alba that the meal marched on, the handmade gnocchi each dainty beneath smoked cheese while the semolina pudding somehow managed to outperform even the aforementioned soup, the egg yolk delivering the white truffle essence in an bold, slowly residing wave. \n\nAt this point turning away a forth (or 8th) round of bread for fear of falling asleep at the show, a makeshift \"Surf & Turf\" duo was sent forth from the kitchen, the beef quality readily apparent in a ruby red cut of rib cap while firm yet moist halibut compared favorably to any served in Sin City, the crispy squash blossom replicating the texture of skin an innovative bit of flare.\n\nNever shy to request additional sweets, especially with the name Kamel Guechida attached to the carte, it was to much amusement that a second table was positioned in the aisle to accommodate each of a half-dozen offerings, only my personal distaste for passionfruit denying absolute delightment as everything  from simple cookies and fruit crisp to an elegant souffle and cheesecake were perfectly executed, the orange curd infused beignets a 'best-of-the-genre' sort of dish that would have been just as good at any time of day.\n\n****Truly the \"Grand Dame\" of reinventing Las Vegas dining from AYCE Buffets and Prime Rib Specials to what it is today, the food and service at Spago in The Forum Shops remains destination worthy under the guidance of Eric Klein, my only gripe being a bit of ingredient redundancy in terms of the use of tomatoes as well as corn, obviously both seasonally appropriate and delicious but all-told a bit too pervasive with the appearance of one or the other in more than 50% of the savories served...a first world problem to say the least."

I found Spagos can and does happily accommodate food allergies  (in my case that means gluten free). We arrived early for our reservation and were promptly seated. I ordered a hurricane and the waiter recommended a Samurai (whiskey cocktail) to the birthday boy. The waiter was very knowledgeable on the menu, he explained what I could order and made a couple recommendations. We ordered a chopped salad to share, The birthday boy ordered the scampi and I had the sea bass special both were fantastic. For dessert we shared a peanut butter souffle and a plate of small treats. All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, the food was delectable. All in all Spagos made the evening a resounding success."

Thank you for not underestimating the importance that bread plays in a meal.  YUM.  I made a note to myself about the bread.  It read: butter, salt, pepper, and oil...four choices.  I have no idea what that meant but figured I'd pass it on ;-).\n\nTry the cheesy Margarita flat bread if you are hungry and don't think it will fill you up before dinner.  Boy I love bread.\n\nI tuna for my main entree and it was cooked perfectly.  Nothing out of this world, but a fantastic meal.  \n\nThe wine list is really pricey, but I guess I should expect that in Vegas.  I found an Italian wine on the list for $70 which was rare - most were way more expensive.  It was good though!"

Yes, a penny machine that STOLE my money.  I still wanted a decent meal and stumbled upon Spago, just about 175 yards or so away from that stupid Goldfish game.  I looked at what I could afford on the menu and we decided on pizza.   It was a really decent price and everything else on the menu was so much more expensive.\n\nFirst of all, the bread we chose from the bread basket being handed to us had foccacia and flat bread so I ate both.   The flat bread was excellent.   I already had high hopes.  Plus the servers were really nice to us too.  \n\nAnyway, I ordered the mushroom pizza with roasted portabellas and some kind of taste that I've never tasted in a pizza before.  It couldn't have been just the parmesan.  These were really thin-crust pizzas which I normally don't get, but this was just melt-in-my-mouth fantastic.  Next, I tried my husband's Italian house made sausage with tuscan black olives hidden beneath each sausage.  Oh man, another completely different flavor bursting in my mouth.  \n\nOverall, for such a famous restaurant with a Wolfgang Puck name, I was very impressed that I could still find something cheap enough to eat and totally delicious.  I wonder if they sell these pizza flavors in the frozen food section at the supermarket... hmm..."

We also got the complimentary bread but it was so hard I actually cut the roof of my mouth from the crust! The Margharita (drink) I got tasted so nasty I swear it was well and not the kind the menu said they used. I know I was not in the minority about the taste of the food as some of my dinner companions had something they did not like about their plate.

As I've said before, he is a consummate professional and represents everything a server should be: engaged and informed and really interested in making your meal (even at lunch!) a memorable experience.  He will go out of his way to make great suggestions and accommodate requests.  I still think he should get some kind of award!\n\nNow to the food: the goulash is back.  Unless it seems too heavy for you, this is not to be missed!  It's got a ton of meat (beef) in it, of very good quality and the sauce really has a nice kick.  A 1/2 chopped salad was a great starter and the Baked Alaska was a good follow-up as a relatively light dessert.\n\nMy only caveat is that they are not shy about using salt, and while I don't find anything over-salted, it is the predominant seasoning in many of their dishes.  I think if it works, it's totally legit, and it does.  But if you're not a fan of salt, you might mention that they go easy on it when you order.\n\nAlso, the iced tea remains the best anyplace, ever...!

We didn't order a bottle of wine because we decided to eat so early, and honestly from that moment we were treated like homeless people begging for leftovers. Very disappointed. We won't be back.

Matt our server, what can I say besides I'm very impressed he and his team were very attentive but not in your face kind of way. For starters I had wild mushrooms soup it's smooth creamy and earthy goodness. Hubby had Caesar salad with romaine hearts a side of anchovies. Not over powering on the dressing it has a hint of tart flavor which I find blend well with the salty cheese. I ate half of his salad it was that good. I was hesitant to order Gnocchi with mushrooms and spinach. In the past at another restaurant I recalled their gnocchi was chewy and gummy. But decided to give it a try at Spago was i surprised! It's yummy soft deliciousness. Hubby had pork chops and potatoes, it cooked to perfection tender and flavored really well with the pur\u00e9e pear.  Desserts red velvet cake with cream cheese ice cream topped with granola and fruit orange slice. The cake layered with cream   filling. Red velvet was dense too sweet for my taste. Wish they added more orang slices I like it that way better a hint of sweet and tart balance out the the rich filling and cream cheese ice cream. Next visit I'll skip desserts.

We will definitely be back during our next Vegas trip and will try his 8 course dinner!!"

It was supposed to be grilled...I was expecting a bit of char with tender meat to the bite. Instead it was chewy, had no indication of it being grilled and did not have much taste. Its only saving grace was the white bean ragu it sat over which was delicious.\n\nI'm a huge fan of octopus and love to try it at any place that dares to prepare this very difficult dish to master. The only folks who get it right are the Spaniards (in Galicia, Spain where Octopus is a signature dish) and Greeks, who know how to grill it just right.\n\nEveryone else just can't seem to get it right. It's a shame too, because most Americans have never had it and if their first introduction to it is through a less-than-stellar experience they will be turned off and conclude it's not very good.\n\nOctopus is amazing!"

We had been walking through the Forum Shops for most of the afternoon and by the time we got to the end, we were somewhat hungry and I think it was either here or Trevi. We chose this place I guess because at least we knew of Wolfgang Puck's other restaurant in LA. \n\nThe restaurant is kind of divided into two dining areas, with the patio serving cafe style food and with the main dining room serving more fine dining cuisine. Both areas are nice, but I think I prefer the cafe because it's kind of like sitting outdoors because of the changing sky colors outside. Upstairs they have huge plasma televisions and more dining space that goes unused. The coolest thing was that in the men's bathroom they have these padded urinals with splash guard. If you're a guy, you know that sometimes when you pee, you get splash (come on, we've all had that happen because of the damn porcelain). Well this anti-splash guard absorbs all the droplets of urine, and I've never seen that before so that was cool (see how fancy Spago can be?) \n\nAnyway, their bread is pretty good. They have three different kinds: this Parmesan bread, olive bread and this flat cracker bread. It comes with cream goat cheese spread (but the goat cheese isn't very strong at all so it was quite good). We started off with an appetizer of Skirt Steak Quesadilla with Sour Cream, Guacamole, and Pico de Gallo. The waitress said we would never taste anything like this in a quesadilla and she was right. It was probably the best quesadilla I've ever had because the skirt steak was just like eating buttery steak. But after that, everything else was just average. I had a chicken sandwich on walnut bread and also tried some of the duck from the dinner menu and some type of pasta. Anyway, everything tasted overpriced. But at least the food sat well for clubbing!"

The portion size of the spaghetti was huge (the waiter warned us that the Ravioli would only be a single piece and it was more of an appetizer sized portion). \nThe service was great, the restaurant was not very crowded. Wine, cocktail, duck and spaghetti- Total meal cost $92. \nBathroom is upstairs!"

The service as far as refilling our drinks was also horrible.  The place was basically empty, so I expect much better service.  One of our party mentioned that the service was really bad and that he wanted the 18% gratuity (already tacked on for a party of our size which is the norm) to be removed.  It wasn't.

My family arrived at 12:30pm for Monday brunch, although I felt that the menu would have been better suited for dinner. There is an outside seating area available for those keen on people watching, but we chose to sit inside for better privacy. Even though our food took a while to come out, our waiter was attentive and gave us free bread with extra virgin olive oil.\n\n// Chinese Chicken Salad ($16): 5 stars\nThis salad was actually the reason we decided to dine at Spago. My mom recalled how much she savored this dish during her previous trip to Vegas several years ago, and she wanted the rest of us to taste it too. It did not disappoint!\n\n// House Smoked Salmon Pizza ($33): 5 stars\nDespite the expensive price, the amount of salmon on this pizza was very generous. It was my favorite order of the afternoon.\n\n// Hand Cut Fettuccine Pasta ($19): 3 stars\nAlthough the ingredients used for this pasta were undoubtedly high quality, I thought the dish really lacked in flavor. I wouldn't recommend it.\n\n// Roasted Free Range Jidori Chicken ($24): 4 stars\nThe chicken was so tender and juicy! It also came with a side of broccoli rabe and potato pur\u00e9e, which were both tasty.\n\nProTip: Spago usually only serves the bread with olive oil for dinner, but since we asked, they gladly gave us some for brunch as well.

I came here once at lunch with some friends, and then later came here for a business dinner during the busy times of CES in Vegas.  My conclusion is that this place is expensive/overpriced for what it is, and the service was OK for lunch and bad for my dinner experience.  We spent about $650 there for 6 of us, and I probably would have been happier spending that same money at Mesa Grill or Tao.  \n\nOnto the bad service we experienced:  we had a very absent-minded server.  He had to be reminded multiple times to bring us our drinks.  And when he finally brought them over, he forgot who had what.  Then, we had to ask him for bread once we saw another table having bread.  When one of us asked if he could just leave the bread rather than serve us one by one, he said he was not allowed to do so.  Not much longer, we saw another table with their tray of bread left at their table.  The food served was decent.  \n\nI don't think I would come back to Spago again."

            "review": "I absolutely loved this place. One of my best meal experiences. \n\nThat said, I will begin with the truth. I had my doubts. I only knew a handful of things about Wolfgang Puck: (1) he's a celebrity chef, (2) he haz an accent, and (3) he cooks for the Oscars. S'it. \n\nThis could have gone either way. It could be amazing because, well, he cooks for ze movie stars and he wouldn't be world famous if his food was awful. Or, it could all just be hype.  \n\nWell, Wolfgang Puck is amazing, and he is famous for a reason. Because his talent is delicious. \n\nTHE FOOD: We totally conquered. \n\nThe white peach bellini was one of or probably the best bellini I ever had. Each sip was like biting into a crisp, juicy, succulent white peach. Even though it didn't seem like very much in the glass, I got a nice little buzz from it. That must be quality champagne. \n\nThe bread waiters came and offered you as much as you wanted from a bountiful basket. We got to choose from a sourdough, a cherry walnut, an olive loaf, a cracker (with seeds, herbs, and things - since I don't like crackers, this was my least favorite), and an onion focaccia. The soft, slightly sweet, buttery cube of onion focaccia was clearly the favorite of the night. Dipped in their quality olive oil, it was a great meal starter. \n\nThe amuse bouche was a cappuccino sized cup of cold, creamy pea soup. It tasted so fresh. As if you plucked the peas yourself, eating them while still standing in a garden, with your toes in the cool dirt. However, since I'm not a cold soup fan, I didn't like it that much. \n\nWe ordered several appetizers to share. The crab cakes, the heirloom tomato soup, the warm wild mushroom salad, and the octopus salad. \n\nThe heirloom tomato soup was probably my favorite dish of the entire night, and that's saying something since my meal and the warm wild mushroom salad were both incredible. I mean, sooo many wins here. The soup was large, came in a clay-pot sized, white porcelain bowl complete with cute hat, and a crostini that was spread with a creamy white cheese and then piled high with fluffy parmesan. On top of the soup was a thin design of balsamic vinegar that complimented the soup like jelly compliments peanut butter. Spooning up a mouthful and letting the fresh tomato, sweet balsamic, exotic herbs, and delicate cream dance in my mouth was a little piece of Heaven. \n\nThe warm mushroom salad was layered with mushrooms I can't name, but they were each delicious. Some of the mushrooms were delicate, while others were slightly crunchy and \"meaty\" (like portobellos). The salad was tossed warm with arguala and pomegranate seeds and was a heart warming, unique salad that was perfect for a Fall day (in windy Las Vegas). \n\nI ordered the special because I couldn't resist the following words: truffle-cream + Alaskan king crab. Other words like mushroom, onion, and fettucine were in there as well. It was, of course, awesome. I mean, it had truffle oil in it. Truffle oil makes everything better! \n\nMy mom ordered the seafood paella and it was very tasty, though a tad undercooked, IMO. The scallops and shrimp were huuuge! The bf ordered what I deemed the \"pig plate\" which consisted of pork belly, pork loin, and 3 kinds of sausage including blood - very neat concept. Overall, every single person was over-the-moon pleased with their dinner. \n\nUnfortunately (very very), I was over-ruled when it came to dessert. Everybody else was too full, so we didn't try any. I bet they're fantastic though. Next time... \n\nATMOSPHERE: Ending with looks and folks. Spago is hard, clean lines, it's modern art, mirrors, and black walls. Too noisy for an intimate dinner, but fun for a family or group. Service was polite, friendly, and extremely accomodating, but I didn't feel all warm and fuzzy like I did at Alexander's. It was quite nice when they saw us pouring our own wine and decided to swoop in and do it themselves. Nice catch. Prices were SURPRISINGLY reasonable! You can spend $50 to $150 a person, your choice. \n\nI'm a Puck fan now."

I had a Caprese salad and it was so delicate, with both the slabs of heirloom tomatoes and the small halved cherry tomatoes on the side were at the exact perfect nano-second of ripeness. I'm not sure if they reduced the balsamic and oil or what they did, but the drizzle of dressing was the finest of any Caprese salad I've ever had (and I've had plenty). It was not in the least harsh or acidic; it was faintly sweet and even appeared different, with a greenish hue. It was divine. \n\nWhat a great place for lunch!

Three types of bread peeked out of the bread cone and were served alongside of olive oil, butter, and sea salt. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ?select=jZoe75G5Z7xcJ_j3BZfFow\n\nThe calamari was served with a side bed of marinated cucumbers and hearts of palm in coriander vinaigrette and with garlic aioli and sweet chili dipping sauces. The skin wasn't too thick, but it didn't taste like anything special. The garlic aioli wasn't really my style, but at least the sweet chili dipping sauce was good. (Although it could have used more kick to it as there was virtually none.) I did enjoy the marinated cucumbers and hearts of palm on the side, but it wasn't enough to really wow me. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ?select=bROyHh3fUqgE-SSgKP1VIw\n\nThe unagi glazed scottish salmon salad over romaine lettuce, daikon radish, shiso, avocado, celeric remoulade, steamed jasmine rice, and Japanese vinaigrette was probably my favorite dish.

It was covered with roasted portabella mushrooms, caramelized white onions, Italian parsley, and parmesan cheese. The mushroom flavor was strictly confined to the bites with mushroom directly on it, which I understand, but I expected the flavor to extend beyond just a little bit. Maybe it was having the parmesan cheese melted as the one and only cheese, but it just wasn't my style. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ?select=sx7d_nf9JyNQXQDILFchbA\n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed.

I'd suggest that you specifically read other reviews for the dishes - maybe my family just ordered the \"wrong\" ones."

Sure glad we did.  \n\nWife and I ate lunch on 8/22/2013, having the pepperoni thin crust pizza.  The sauce base was the most flavorful I have ever tasted.  It was as if it was made with a cream base.  The crust was as delicious as the main dish. \n\nDrinks were excellent as well.  Superb attention to service.  A total delight!"

Service was ok, but the food was not at all what we would expect from Wolfgang Puck.  I was served a piece of salmon that clearly was not fresh.  Food was tasteless, including the sauces, especially on the pizza.  Coming from New York and having dined in Wolfgang's Steakhouse many times, we had high expectations, which unfortunately didn't materialize here in Vegas. So many places to dine along the strip - spend your money elsewhere."

I had the lamb chops and my friend had the filet mignon. They both tasted amazing! And, before they brought out the dishes, we had all the bread they offered, which tasted really good. And, then the waiter brought us tomato bisque, which he said was compliments of the chef. Even that tasted great! For dessert, we had the pineapple polenta and the root beer bon bon. The pineapple dessert was very light and fresh whereas the root beer dessert was very rich and decadent. Loved them both. For drinks, I had the ginger drop, which was one of the best drinks I've ever had. The bill was really expensive, but well worth it. If you want to try this place, you have to be willing to spend the money."

            "review": "I've always wanted to try dishes by the famous Wolfgang Puck. Thanks to a recommendation from a fellow Yelper (Pauline Le), I decided to come here while exploring The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. I've read how pricey dinner can be here, so I came for lunch at their cafe around opening. It wasn't too packed yet since a lot of the shops were just starting to open up, but even when the mall and Spago were starting to get crowded after noon, it didn't hinder the excellent service by the Spago staff. The food here is truly something special. Everything you would normally know to be true of a certain dish is twisted up into something deliciously creative. The total bill came out to be about $65 (without tip), but it's well worth the price!\n\nComplementary Bread\nSpago serves you a variety of breads, playing with different textures and flavors, with 3 different items for you to dip the bread in (sea salt, butter, and olive oil). The olive oil is possibly my favorite of the 3 dips because it was infused with a few herb leaves (I know it's either rosemary or thyme, but I can't remember). I liked that none of these breads were overpowering in flavor and not so filling to the point where I couldn't enjoy my appetizers and entrees. I had never had a restaurant serve me in this style before, so I loved having the selection and variety of textures and dips to mix and taste together!\n\nParsley and Cauliflower Soup\nThis twist on the typical cream of broccoli soup left my boyfriend and me wanting more. It wasn't so hot that we couldn't eat it immediately, but stayed warm throughout the meal until we could devour it all. The consistency of the soup was just perfect: thick but not too thick to the point of clumpiness. It had enough of the vegetables to be filling but not overwhelm your appetite. It might only be a seasonal soup, but if it's still around when you visit, it's a must-try!\n\nCrab Cakes\nThis is the only dish that I had where I'd say it's closer to the standard crab cakes that you can find at other upscale restaurants, but I would nevertheless recommend trying it if you crave it. This is truly crab cakes done right: thin, crunchy crust with fresh crab inside on a bed of bright tasty greens drizzled with a light vinaigrette. It's a lovely classic that's a perfect starter to your meal.\n\nTurkey French Dip\nI've only had roast beef french dips in the past, and me not being a big beef eater, I was ecstatic to see a meat that I love in this dish. I was already getting somewhat full after eating bread, soup, and crab cakes, but the minute that I took a bite of this sandwich, I couldn't stop eating it! It's amazing how one dish made me hungry to eat more after just one bite! The turkey meat was cooked perfectly; it wasn't dry, it was cut very thin, and it had little to no fat. I couldn't believe how incredibly tender and juicy it was; it was only more amazing in conjunction with the french dip. I can't emphasize enough how this dish is a must-try!\n\nMushroom Pizza\nThis pizza had no tomato sauce, which I appreciated because I wish my pizzas would always come this way. It was very thin and had only cheese and 1 mushroom on each slice, but wow was the mushroom cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy and harmonized beautifully with the rest of the cheese pizza. It wasn't my entree and I only had 1 slice of it, but I wish I had enough stomach space to have eaten more!"

I mean, I've had urth's smoked salmon pizza but this blows it out of the water. It's really the pinnacle 5/5\nThe crispy rice with tuna tartare was also quite delicious. The crispy rice was in a thin cone. It was slightly sweet and was thin enough that it didn't get stuck in your teeth like a lot of crispy Rice's do 4/5\nAnother surprising appetizer for me was the dumplings. It definitely tasted like homemade dough and the filling seems authentic. It was not too thick, not too thin and was surprisingly tasty. 5/5\nI got the sea bass entree. The skin was crispy, the fish was well cooked and well seasoned. No complaints here 3/5\nThe desserts were really what took this meal to the next level.\nThe salted caramel souffle. Amazed. However you have to eat this quickly or the texture does change from the beginning to the end of the dish. It went from tasting like a fluffy flan to a dense marshmallow 5/5\nPot de Creme came in the shape of a brick. But it was still that same fudgy, dense chocolate 4/5\nCaramel apple crisp came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and had a nice homey feel. On the verge of being a little too sweet but I found myself keep going back for more. I like desserts like this 3/5"

I got the half portion which was a nice start and I probably could have shared that with someone. \n\nThe bread came nicely presented with three sides of salt, butter, and olive oil with a touch of rosemary. Can't remember the three types of bread off the top of my head, one was a crispy pita-like bread, the other had cranberries in it I believe, and there was one more could have been sourdough but I can't remember.\n\nFinally the meatloaf, which is one of their most popular dishes apparently, was interesting, the mashed potatoes were cooked and seasoned nicely, for me the meatloaf was just alright -- It was good but I've definitely had better as well. \n\nI was in between giving this place 3 or 4 stars but I tilted towards 4 because the service was good and the food enjoyable enough to make me want to come back and explore the menu a little more."

They took care of us like we were the only people in the restaurant even though it was full during dinnertime. Our server definitely anticipated our every need and was great. My little sister is a vegetarian and we were scared they didn't have any options for her but they were able to put together a meal that was superb for her! They gave her 4 dishes of the sides that they usually make for each of their four top selling dishes. The chef also sent out a complementary tasting of the lobster bisque. If I didn't already order at the time, I would have gotten that for my meal. \n\nThe cherry walnut bread was the best of all the breads! Our table loved it so much that the bread staff came by and kept refilling our plates without us even asking! I started off the dinner with the lobster salad. I thought it was going to be a lot of salad and not a lot of lobster but the ratio was really good. They portioned it out enough that I was able to get a piece of grapefruit, avocado, lobster, and greens in every bite. The flavors worked so well together that I was amazed. for my entree I had the scallops which were perfectly cooked. I love scallops but never have I had them so sweet and not overcooked. My boyfriend had the mushroom pizza which was also very delicious. If I were to go back, I think I would order what my older sister ordered. She got the sea bass. \n\nFor dessert since it was my sister's birthday they wrote happy birthday on the apple dessert. The honey mascarpone cream was to die for! \n\nThe best part was that before the dinner they asked us if we were on a time schedule which we were. We had to make a show after dinner and they were very quick with everything from the food to the check that it gave us plenty of time to enjoy our dinner and to make the show on time. \n\nMake sure that you stop by this restaurant if you're in Vegas because you'll definitely enjoy all of the food."

I was a part of a group of six or eight people (can't remember exactly) on a Saturday late-night. Us ladies sat down at the bar and expected that the bartender would come over to ask for our orders, which was not the case. I'm not sure if he thought we were just sitting to sit or what, but we wanted our drinks before we were seated. Not the case. The guy was rude (even our waiter who was awesome said the guy's a jerk). We did eventually get our drinks, though. The food is amazing. Very tasty. You are paying strip prices, though so keep that in mind. Small portions and large checks. I'm not sure of the food quality was worth the price that tourists will pay, but I did enjoy myself, as did the others in my party. I probably won't stop by there again because I'm not really about eating on the strip, but you should probably try it once if you're not a tourist."

I personally ordered the pancetta wrapped meatloaf which was excellent. It had a very smooth almost creamy texture with some really great flavor. I'd also say that with this dish you get plenty of food for your buck. The pizza was good too but there really isn't much pizza out there I don't like. Cheese and bread is always a safe bet. Some of my other girlfriends got the pasta dishes and said that they were delicious but the portions were a little too small. Overall, It's a great restaurant.

Salads were the Melon & Fig salad (minus the prosciutto) - it was yummy but we were really kicking ourselves for not getting the Heirloom Tomato salad. Those maters were ginormous w/ thick slabs of fresh Mozz & it was just way too tempting! \n\nEntrees for both consisted of the FARMERS' MARKET WHITE CORN AGNOLOTTI - Sweet & fresh off the cob caramelized Corn, Celery Leaves and Locatelli Pecorino Romano in this little, itty, bitty cheese filled pasta......both sis & I were literally mopping up ALL the left over sauce w/ our bread. Would probably have licked the plates had the room not been completely packed & there was a need for a modicum of decorum.  Also - be sure to pair your pasta w/ their Merlot......it was fruity & light & not only completely complimented the Corn, but enhanced the flavor in the bestest way!\n\nDessert was the perfect topping to this most scrumptious meal - Assorted Cookies for sis & Pear Cobbler for me. Cookies were warm & gooey - freshly baked to the point we squeezed a cookie & schmoousche, out comes a globby bloop of chocolate.  The Cobbler had this fluffy biscuit w/ Chai Ice Cream to surround the sauteed Pears & Huckleberries - paired w/ fresh Raspberries & Blueberries. Y - U - M!! \n\nCan't wait to come back to Spago"

The ambiance is weird--it's in the Forum shops and the front opens to a patio to the shops. So, as you go in, you feel like you are going into any mall restaurant anywhere in America. As you go back into the restaurant, you never lose that mall feel.\n\nThe food did not save it. While the amuse was good (a taste of tomato soup), it then took 40 minutes for my chicken to come out. The waiter made various excuses, but since there was no note on the menu saying the chicken takes forever, I am guessing there was some mistake made in the kitchen or by the expediter. When it did come out, it was undercooked--and I mean the kind of undercooked that is plainly visible under dark dinner lighting. So, Picky had to send it back. It took another 10 minutes to finish cooking it (a testament to how under-cooked it was the first time and how badly the kitchen was running). Mind you, the restaurant was not packed; there were plenty of open tables, tons of front of house staff, etc. so I have no idea what was taking so long in the back of the house.\n\nWhen I did get a food-safety approved plate, it was average. For $40 and 50 minutes, I would have liked a really good piece of chicken. I will give kudos to the vegetable prep cook--those were darn good, but it was hard to save the meal at that point.\n\nSo, Wolfgang, I think you need to check in on your Las Vegas digs. It's not living up to the Spago brand."

Service was again second to none... from the hosts initial greeting to the busser who clears our table everyone truly made us feel like we were the only people in the restaurant. \n\nStarted with the fried calamari and a caesar salad. The calamari was so light and fluffy and not greasy at all (I'm guessing it was tempura batter?) and the caesar was fresh with real anchovies on it. We then split the oxtail gnocchi which is hand-made. I usually don't order gnocchi because it reminds me of dumplings and are dense, but these literally melted in our mouths. The oxtail is braised for 24 hours (per our server) and man-oh-man was it tender. We also split an Italian meat pizza which you can't go wrong with. \n\nI always order the Xiang Li cocktail, which is the most pear martini ever. I have searched far and wide at other restaurants and have even attempted to duplicate this drink at home but it's never the same.

So, when Absinthe ended this past Sunday night, and we were hungry for pizza (and knowing the Trump shuttle where we were staying shows up right below Spago), we stopped in for a pizza.  We were very clear to the Hostess that that was all we wanted, and admirably we didn't feel discriminated upon for only wanting such a small Spago experience.  We were led to a table for two in the back.  I ordered a $9 Cabernet and husband ordered tea.  We agreed on a pizza which was described as such: \n\nITALIAN SAUSAGE-Roasted Fennel, Tuscan Black Olives, Reggiano Cheese and Thyme \n\n  We were brought out a divided dish of olive oil, butter, salt and pepper.  And baskets were brought around with foccacia, sourdough and flatbread.  Nice, but one can only do so much bread, ya know?  Then came the pizza and sadly it was disappointing!  Honestly, both of us agreed that it tasted like the crust had been pre-frozen.   We got better pizza at the Wicked Spoon buffet the next day.  Toppings were nice, but the crust was very disappointing.  \n\n  It was not bad.  But it wasn't (imho) up to what we had experienced via Wolfgang in the past.  (nobody on the planet could be a bigger fan than me of his butternut squash soup that I would (and have) killed for),\n\n  This time I can only say that  we've had better.  But we are appreciative of the experience."

We started with chicken wing lollipops which were delectable and moved into a Mickey Mouse shaped pizza for my son, a salad for my wife and a meatloaf dish for myself.  Wolfgang is known for his pizzas, righfully so it was great, which comes from a wood fired oven gracing the bar and \"patio\" poriton of the restaurant.  The meatloaf is a cannot miss!  I'm normally not a meatloaf person, but it was fantastic.  The dish is more of a hamburger than a meatloaf.  Bursting with flavor and finished with a potato puree as opposed to mashed hit the spot.

The dish was just soo fresh and lite overall the sauce was a very light mushroom sauce that went great with the pasta because the pasta was soo fresh and you wouldn't want to have a heavy sauce go with fresh pasta (cause thats a no no).\n\nThe Mushroom Ravioli blew me away so I wanted to try another pasta dish...\n\nNext came the Hand Cut Spaghttini T.B.G.\n\nVery simple yet very delicious!  Tomatoes, basil and  garlic (hence the T.B.G.) in a Pistou sauce or a cold sauce made from cloves of garlic, fresh basil, and olive oil.

Mr. Puck is also churning out so much product and product placement nowadays that I think he is bordering on the same. However we were staying in Caesar's and my father-in law wanted Italian- so Spago it was . Can you tell I was enthused? Imagine my surprise when we had excellent service- some fantastic food and a decent wine menu. The shrimp appetizer with endive, cucumber and radish was one of THE best colds apps I've ever had. It was more of a salad than anything-  the shrimp was very plump and juicy, the other veg. was fresh and crisp- and the dressing was bright, tangy and refreshing. (There was something in it I couldn't name- it still drives my crazy). My pizza was great- that night and the next day. My father in-law, the Italian- was very happy with the ricotta gnocchi in brown butter. He is a strict tomato-basil sauce kind of guy- and our server said they'd make it that way off-menu for him. Nice!  But I insisted he get the brown butter sauce- and he was happy he did. It was just right- not overly greasy or buttery- with a hint of fresh herb and a touch of acidity.  The salmon dish was also excellent.\nWe'll certainly go back- at least so I can go back and flog the chef de cuisine for that shrimp dish recipe."

I would drink half of my ice tea and it would be filled up immediately.   The salad is the best Chinese chicken salad that you will eat.  I have had this before and it never disappoints.   A must if you don't have the original where you live."

There was about a 10 minute wait and we were seated outside.  It was a great place to sit because we were facing the shops and were able to people watch.  Its always funny to catch people look at your food. \n\nOkay the complimentary bread basket was sooo good.  We literally had 3 of them.  In the bread bowl there is a variety of breads and crackers and you can dip them into these 3 different condiments which was butter, olive oil, and salt.  Not sure how the salt worked and didn't use that. \n\nIts pretty fancy here so I felt underdressed for lunch but a lot of people looked casual as well.  I'd say a good place to dress up for dinner tho. \n\nI got the Skirt Steak quesadilla and it was soo good! The steak was great and the salsa, guacamole and sour cream made it so delicious. \n\nI'd be down to try the other Wolfgang place for sure."

I felt very unclassy :( My friend and I came back the next day for late lunch/early dinner, on the more suitably-priced-for-college-students cafe side.\n\n-Tuna Sashimi: AMAZING. 4 bites of beautiful red tuna on top of a crispy rice cake and some magically delicious sauce that my unrefined palate cannot even begin to name. (Just looked it up, the menu says \"Wasabi-Ginger Vinaigrette\") We needed about 4 more pieces though. Each.\n\n-Margherita wood fire pizza: Lovely thin crispy pizza. The tomatoes were fresh and sweet and the cheeses strong. We each ate 3 slices and ended up full.\n\n-Dranks: Tangerine-something mojito for me, ginger-something for the roomie. Both strong, delicious, well-priced for Vegas standards. The mojito was very refreshing :)\n\nTotal came out to $35 per person, including tip. I would definitely recommend the cafe as a nice classy lunch/dinner stop in the middle of shopping the forums. The atmosphere was chill and we didn't have to yell to be heard. Our waiter always seemed in a rush, but had a great sense of humor (even after the roomie dropped her knife and caused him to drop and break a plate). Oh and I'm definitely bringing my mom here for the bread basket. It had a variety including parmesan crisps and cranberry-walnut, and it came with olive oil, sea salt, and BUTTER. Really good butter. I can't wait to be rich and try the restaurant side."

Service and quality far exceeds the price (which is rare at restaurants). We ordered fried calamari and the lamb chorizo pizza. The calamari was great because it seemed like they used batter similar to the kind you find in tempura. It came with sour cream and this ginger sauce for dipping. It was exceptional. The sauce made all the difference.  The pizza was great too. It had thin slices of lamb, goat cheese and small pieces of orange on it.  It tasted very unique and flavorful. They also had a large variety of bread to choose from along with a blend of goat cheese and sour cream to go along with it. I generally feel that restaurants named after big name chefs are overrated and overpriced. However, Spago absolutely lived up to its name. I can't wait to try my next Wolfgang Pucks restaurant!"

We had a good meal, paid with my charge card and left.  Upon returning home my wife's habit is to go on-line and check our accounts.  She noticed $700 purchases at Best Buy in Chicago had been charged to our account.  We called the bank and they reversed the charges (and air miles ) and arranged to have new cards sent to us.  We called my sister to tell her to watch her account.  A few days later they noticed charges in Maine appearing on their card.  We had used a charge card, they had used a debit card.  The connection to this review is that the only place they had used their debit card was at Spago.\n\nI called Spago and was told that the managers were in a meeting and would return my call in 15 minutes.  Two hours later I re-called and got to speak to a manager.  The manager was terrific on the phone.  He communicated sincerity and concern.  I was able to tell him the time, date and section we ate in. He promised to investigate and get back to me promptly.  That conversation was over a week ago.  I have heard nothing since.\n\nThe lesson I learned when in a place that does not have security chip capabilities, is to never let the card out of my sight.  I know it is a first world problem, but the inconvenience of changing cards is a pain!"

The food is always well cooked, with fresh ingredients and depth of flavor. The duck haunts me, it is so sweet, moist, almost beautiful.

Fresh veggies, meats and sauce all nearly perfectly balanced. Grab a cocktail and Kobe sliders at the Bar and chat up the Bartenders."

I actually wish I would have eaten here more each time. This past occasion we were debating not going to Spago just because we had eaten here last time and there are so many places we just didn't get to try. However, someone made the brilliant decision that we were going to Spago again and I'm thankful because this was once again my FAVORITE meal in Vegas.\n \nTo start off I have to mention the awesome bread basket, so delicious, the flat bread, the sweet bread, the sourdough ahh my mouth is watering as I write this. The accompanying sea salt, butter and olive oil is also amazing.\n\nOn this trip to Spago we sat \"outside\" and were able to order off of the cafe menu and the dinner menu. \n\nLast time we ordered the oysters and we remember how amazing they truly were by ordering them again. Spago's oysters are the best and freshest in Las Vegas, if you eat oysters or just want to try them get them here.\n\nThis time there were 7 of us so we got to try a lot of menu items. \n\nThere were two orders of the special salad that night which was Caprese Salad with heirloom tomatoes and buffalo mozzerella. It was fantastic. I ordered the Olsen Farm's Baby Arugula Salad, Farmers' Market Pear & Fig, Shaved Fennel, Burrata Cheese, Prosciutto San Daniele, Ice Wine Vinegar and Olive Oil. I had them put the Proscuitto on the side and someone else ate it. The salad was intense. The creamy Burrata accompanied with the fresh fig and pears, so good. Get this if you have a chance. \n\nI also ordered the Farmer's Market White Corn Soup, Trumpet Royale Mushrooms, Caramelized Cipollini Onions, Fava Beans, Cherry Tomatoes, Arugula and Basil Oil. This was the all-star of the night for everyone who tasted it. It was so fresh and savory I would have licked the bowl if it would have been appropriate.\n\nFor Entree's we had 3 orders of the Hand Cut Fettuccini, Wild Oregon Mushrooms, English Peas, Arugula, Glazed Shallots, Parmesan-Reggiano. This was a popular dish the last time we ate here so one of us ordered it again and two others joined along. It was as delicious as we remembered.\n\n2 orders of the Caserecci Pasta a la Bolognaise,Braised Beef, Roasted Double Blanched Garlic, Plum Tomatoes, House Made Ricotta Cheese. Both people who ordered this loved it. \n\nUnagi Glazed Scottish Salmon Salad, Romaine Lettuce, Daikon Radish, Shiso, Avocado, Carrot R\u00e9moulade , Steamed Jasmine Rice, Japanese Vinaigrette. It looked beautiful.\n\nSpago Pancetta-wrapped Meatloaf, Russet Potato Pur\u00e9e, Mushroom Gravy, Port Wine Sauce, Onion Rings. My friend who ordered this jokingly said his was better, which he says about all food items but he thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nTo top it off we had another birthday here and this time they brought us out an assortment of cookies. We were all completely stuffed but we some how made some room for these cookies. \n\nLast but not least, for the quality of the food the pricing is on point. There are a ton of place in Vegas that take your hard earned money while you sit back and wonder if it was really worth it. This is not one of them.\n\nThank you Spago, when I return to Vegas I will visit, more than once this time."

They acted like as it's normal, however. If I were eating at a roadside diner, maybe so, but that's not acceptable to me when you dress up for the prices they're charging. If the dishwasher doesn't catch that, then the waiter should when he sets the table. My gf got the tasting menu, about $100, but when I indicated that I wanted to peruse the menu, the waiter really pushed the tasting menu. As I don't like sashimi or lamb, I wasn't going to taste them but I got the sense that he wanted me to have the same menu as 1) it made his life easier to bring the same dishes out at the same time - isn't a waiter's job to bring the food you order? and 2) it was more expensive than anything else on the menu. I ended up ordering the crab cakes appetizer and duck breast. They were ok, but ok's not what you're supposed to get at a posh restaurant. Even though I ate half of my gf's dishes - other than the sashimi and lamb - I ended up going to Johnny Rockets later that evening. And I enjoyed that meal much more for 1/6 the price."

That would be the best way to describe my dining experience at Spago this past weekend. \n\nWe had originally intended to order their 6 course Tasting Menu ($95) so we asked the waiter to see a copy. Inexplicably he said there was no printed copy of the menu in the restaurant and he did not volunteer the information as to what was on it. When we pressed him to describe the menu to us, he mumbled in generalities and could not tell us what the individual selections were for the various courses. He also seemed annoyed that we were questioning him and was visibly relieved (for some reason) when we declined the offer of the Tasting Menu. To be fair, the dishes on offer that he could remember (courses 1 and 2) were lifted right from the informal \"lunch/cafe\" menu and could hardly be described as exciting or worth the extra cost. Unfortunately the rest of the service followed that of the waiter. The man charged with bringing bread regularly to the table did so only once (for some reason, a bread basket is served in the cafe area but not in the dinner section of the restaurant) and we twice had dishes incorrectly delivered to us that were ordered by a neighboring table. Our drinks also took more than 15 minutes to prepare which would have been understandable since it was a busy Saturday night but not when we clearly saw that the table next to us which came later got their drinks delivered immediately. Finally, for the first half of our dinner the restaurant played overly loud techno-style music which detracted from the ambiance until it was changed later to a more suitable, jazz-y soundtrack. \n\nAfter all this criticism, I should turn to the food which was quite good without being in any way extraordinary. I had the grilled octopus salad (18), the Filet Mignon (49), and the raspberry baked Alaska (10-12 and the highlight of the meal) while my companion ordered the symphony of tuna (24), the bone-in veal (45), and the key lime desert (10-12). The bone-in-veal was served with a delicious mushroom risotto which I probably would have ordered as a meal unto itself. All in all I can't fault the food but I'm inclined to think that I overpaid slightly and could probably have found a better meal at a lower price. However Spago was right next to the Coliseum theater and as we needed a post-show dinner it proved very convenient. I can't speak for the cafe menu but I did notice that the cafe section was crowded and very energetic and offered the opportunity for good people watching in the Forum shops. The cafe menu is noticeably cheaper than the dinner menu so Spago might be a good place to stop by for lunch."

I ordered this apple, fennel salad that came with prosciutto, mozzarella and goat cheeses and lightly drizzled with some sort of vinegarette (*spelling) sauce.  I was impressed with the presentation and, of course, with the taste.   Portion-wise it was perfect for me!  I ate it all and left satisfied; I did NOT feel bloated or full. \n\nHowever, my friend, the birthday boy, didn't stomach the pepperoni pizza and had some complications the next day.  So I guess... don't order the pizza.   My husband got the pasta bolognese - I had several bites and it was just as spectacular as the pizza.  \n\nCons - Floor was waxed too much... and the bathroom is on the second floor.  So if you have to use the restroom, don't hold it in too long.  Also,  I saw three women on different occasions walk down the slick steps from the bathroom and they ate it hard, especially with those heels they were rocking!  Anyway, they should consider putting in non-slip pads on the floor if they are gonna shine the floors like that.  \n\nOverall - what matters is the food and it's sooo worth every penny!\n\nPS set a reservation, it helps!"

The menu offered plenty of variety and ranged from about $8-12 for appetizers and $18-25 for entrees. My husband and I had an appetizer to share, an entree each and a glass of wine each for $75 which isn't too bad for Vegas. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great dinner with wonderful people watching!"

I had picked out my food from the menu when the waitress came by with some great specials.  A caprese salad with a wonderful variety of tomatoes... delish!  And their bread basket is great!  A large assortment to choose from to tide you over before your meal.  And they gave oil, butter and sea salt to go with it.  Yum!

This is a restaurant that is a must go to when in Vegas!  \n\nThe restaurant is divided into two dining areas, with the patio serving cafe style food and with the main dining room serving more fine dining cuisine. I have never had a bad meal here, everything on the menu is so good, especially the pizza.. You just can't go wrong!  There is a great wine selection too.

Followed that with sauteed scallops, which were perfectly caramelized on both sides. And because I just couldn't get enough, I had to have the chocolate layered cake. \n\nService was top-notch. Executive Chef Eric Klein was a regular on the floor and chatting with patrons. You could tell he really cared about the diners. He sent along a free butternut squash soup amuse bouche my way and ended the meal with a petit four, also gratis. \n\nHonestly, it was a meal that could've gone on forever. I didn't want it to end!"

Everyone around me had ordered a pizza, but no one dared finish the crust. Just like I like the buns on my burger more than the patty, I think a pizza is best when the dough is great...this was inedible.

Nice, large booths and tables. It's pretty.\n\nFood: Ordered the Free Range Organic Chicken. The meat fell off the bone and the accompaniment of the Yukon Gold Potatoes and the mushrooms made the meal all the more satisfying. It was one of the better prepared chicken dishes I've had. My mother ordered the \"Hong Kong Style\" Salmon, which had a nice spice to it. My sister got a special that had shrimp and pasta, but she wasn't as much of a fan of her food as we were of ours.\n\nA definite bonus is all the complimentary stuff they give you. Aside from the delicious assortment of bread and dipping sauces (sea salt!!!!), we were given complimentary split pea puree soup, which was surprisingly tasty, and complimentary truffles for dessert. Prices are above average ($20-35ish dollars a plate), but they also have a cafe menu with cheaper options that look just as good.\n\nDrinks: Had a mojito that tasted great, with just the right amount of mint. My mom got the martini and it was really, REALLY strong. \n\nService: Our waiter (who happened to also be a sommelier!) was awesome. He was always attentive and made great conversation. He wasn't overbearing and you can tell he genuinely cared about whether or not we enjoyed our food.\n\nOverall: Really great food, service, and ambiance.

On the outside it looks very cafe-ish but once you enter it is sophisticated and trendy and overall has a feel which is elegant enough for an important date while being relaxed and hip enough for a group of friends having dinner. \n\nService - The service was good but not great. On our initial drink order the waiter skipped a few of the people who weren't paying attention to him. Now, I understand it isn't polite to miss the waiter when he comes around but it wouldn't have ruined his life to tap the guys on the shoulder or just say \"excuse me\". This way we could have all had our drinks at the same time. \n\nFood - The appetizers were excellent. The sashimi combo was very good and everyone who had the crabcakes liked them. I ordered the Tuna for dinner and it was a little small (maybe a 5 ounce portion) but the flavor was incredible and all of the vegetables and oils complimented the tuna perfectly. \n\nOverall I would recommend Spago to anyone. There are better places in Vegas but you can also do MUCH worse. If you find yourself in the forum shops and you're hungry, pop in and try something. You won't be disappointing."

Thus, i didnt know how fancy this place was. So I come in with my American Apparel sweatshirt, brown cords, and my backpack into this very modern looking place.\n\nLuckily, they were laid back about it. I don't think there was a dress code and I didnt get any dirty looks from the staff or anything, so I actually felt pretty comfortable being there even though every one else was dressed to impress. \n\nAnyways, the staff was awesome and helpful. There was a choice of breads we could choose from to start, so I was already impressed. Then, I went to spread some butter on the bread and thought it tasted funny. That's because it was goat cheese!! Wow!! I'm actually a fan of goat cheese, so more points for that.\n\nI ordered the paella without chorizo (pescatarian) and it was very, very good. It was one of the best paellas i ever had, not necessarily the most authentic, but taste-wise it was beyond good. My friend actually got the paella with chorizo and we concluded it actually tastes better without it.\n\nThat meal set me back $40, but hey it's vegas and I'm on vacation, so whatevs. I'd rather spend my money on fancy things than lose it all playing roulette.

He casually noted that it was our anniversary on the reservation not thinking anything of it. We were promptly seated. Our server.. Ok.. Let me try to think of his name: James, Justin... Something with a J. Was Amazing. He was so kind, polite, helpful and charming. My boyfriend started off with the lobster salad and I had the crab cakes. For my main course, I had the breaded lamb shanks and the boyfriend had the miso.. halibut? (Some type of fish). He ate every bite of his dish but mine was a little bit over powering on taste YET I did enjoy it. For dessert we ordered the creme brulee which had a surprise note written in chocolate saying \"Happy Anniversary\" across the plate paired with a candle and sugar art. The dinner overall was VERY enjoyable. The service was outstanding and the food was very well done. I enjoyed every aspect of the dinner from the constant refilling of water (we downed A LOT of alcohol earlier that day.. dehydrated? yes..) to the little things like them remembering that it was our anniversary and actually acting upon it. Very nice.. \n\n..except for the drunk guy in the silver metallic shirt at the table below ours dancing.. haha but I can't blame Spago.. or can I?"

The soup was pretty good but a world famous chef should be able to do better than that. The salad was almost inedible. it didn't mention on the menu that it would be covered in dill, which is something I would never order if I had known so I wasn't able to eat much of it and left most of it on my plate to be wasted, which I never do. I know liking or not like dill is a personal preference, but if it had just been listed on the menu I could have easily just ordered it without it. The lettuce was also a cheap iceberg and lots of just the spines which is really tacky and a big peeve of mine. There were very limited vegetarian options on the menu, so I thought this would be safe, but it was an unsatisfying meal to say the least."

Somewhere to enjoy a good meal and have a long chat, away from the rush. \nService: our server was the best, and probably the best server I have ever had. At first i thought he was a little too friendly, but soon my opinion changed. He kept trying to establish a conversation with us and although i appreciate the interest and the will to be nice, my ideal meal is not chatting with the server. Oh was i mistaken. That was only right at the beginning; once he had loaded with helpful info about the dishes he gave us our time. He was very knowledgeable and his answers were not - oh yes, thats great-. He knew how the food was cooked, the ingredients, their texture, flavors... everything.(and he knew the right words too). As well, the rest of the staff was 5/5. Everyone willing to make the evening just perfect. \nFood: nothing was less than a 5. The saffron risotto came out sizzling hot. The aroma was strong, crab meat was juicy and fresh; the lemon butter had the perfect citrusy/richness ratio; neat presentation; last but not least: the risotto had that perfect \"onda\"  italians aim for when cooking it. \nThe asian salmon was bigger than i anticipated; i ended up taking some home. Flaky, fresh, smooth and very very flavorful. One of the best i have had. It was accompanied by jasmine rice( rice that was covered with the same sauce used on the salmon). \nMy bf asked for the braised short ribs. Our server told us they would fall apart from looking at them long enough and he was right. The were so tender. We were in vegas for 5 days; we ate at different celebrity chefs' restaurants ( gordon Ramsay, Wolfgang puck, todd english, julian Serrano among others) and that was my bf's favorite dish. Wolfgang puck got his heart and his wallet lol. The ribs came with roasted root veggies but these were not your typical ones; the spices and herbs were very special. \nFor dessert we went with the pineapple souffl\u00e9;  everything you want in a souffl\u00e9.  We could smell it whilst it was arriving to our table. Airy, strong pineapple flavor and accompanied by a rich brown sugar ice cream.\nListen, if you are in Vegas, please give this place a try you wont regret it. \nI almost forgot, the bread they bring to the table at the beginning was also delicious and if you ask them for some olive oil then even better. When i saw how green it was i knew it would be good. Very fruity olive oil; i was told it is sold in some stores( Wolfgang puck olive oil id think) so i'll be buying it if i see it at home. \nLast day in vegas I thought of going back to Spago but my bf and I decided we should dine at Bellagio to enjoy the fountains and try a new place hence,we did\nso. I ended up regretting it ( our hundredths $$$ did not deliver \n as expected that time)  ; if it had been earlier i think id have gone to Spago even after our dinner and order some  food to go(almost). \nWithout a doubt a place we will be back at when we visit Vegas again. \nService 5\nFood 5 \nWorth your money\nOverall: 5"

We ordered the halibut, short-ribs, salmon, and their signature smoked salmon pizza, and not one of them was even remotely impressive. If anything they were below average. The salmon pizza had too much lox on it, and looked more like a smoked salmon party platter for bagel day at work. The salmon was a little burnt and completely smothered with some kind of teriyaki sauce. The short ribs I didn't try, but from the others who did try it, it definitely wasn't a winner either. My halibut was decent, but presentation sucked. When it came out everyone started laughing at my dish because it looked like the fish was sitting in a pool of foamy soap. I wish I could say better things for this Wolfgang Puck establishment....but the story ends here. I think the only plus side to this restaurant was that the decor and ambiance was able to lure us into one of the most pitiful dinners I've had in a long time."

What is more important to the Vegas culinary scene than Wolfgang Puck's eponymous Spago? I mean, he paved the way for chefs who were skeptical about opening restaurants in Las Vegas. We owe this man everything; Las Vegas would not be a culinary destination if not for him.\n\nSpago is THE restaurant to go to, really for any occasion, you can't go wrong. I have been here for both lunch and dinner and each experience was top-notch, although in the evening in the formal dining area it is more private and romantic. \n\nI have tried multiple items on the menus over the years, steaks, chicken, fish pastas, etc. and everything was wonderful. You cannot go wrong with the menu, everything is delicious. All of the desserts are great too. Almost each time I've gone I've gotten free dessert since I am a local, score! In fact, I once went for lunch with four other friends, and although I was the only local, they brought out 3-4 desserts for free anyway.  \n\nAs you can imagine, the service is impeccable. The waiters describe the food in such a manner that you literally drool. They are super knowledgeable about the menu and the ingredients and on top of that everybody is very friendly. \n\nWhenever out-of-towners ask me for a recommendation on where to eat; Spago is always on my top five list, regardless of the occasion. It is great for lunch to people watch and at dinner the ambiance is just spectacular. And on top of that the food is great!\n\nI tip my hat to Chef Puck and Executive Chef Eric Klein. Bravo indeed."

We didn't have time to order an appetizer, but the assortment of breads were quite fresh and enough to hold us over until our entrees arrived.\nMy entree was the Red Wine Braised Beef Short Ribs, and it was honestly out of this world.  It isn't a dish that I normally covet, but this was an amazing attempt to remake a normally plain American dish.  The beef was so tender that I didn't even need a knife for it, and the sauce complimented it so well that every bite I took renewed my appreciation of great food; definitely recommend it to all, definitely 5+ stars.\nOur other entree was the Pan Seared Duck Breast which was also pretty savory.  The meat was quite tender and it came in an orange sauce with mushrooms that complimented it very well.  It wasn't the best I've ever had, but still pretty darn good, 4 stars.\n\nI was initially inclined to give this restaurant 4 stars because the menu seems pretty basic (in terms of options, NOT skill or flavor).  But, when I requested an iced tea and  all they offered was something I can't drink, the waiter (Scott) offered a non-menu tea & threw it on ice.  That service right there definitely bumped it up for me."

The pizza crust are good, but you have to eat fast or the pizza gets soggy and cold. The hand made fettuccine with mushrooms has a nice sauce, but the pasta is a bit hard and doughy. Overall, come here for the atmosphere and pizza though the service could be slow."

I don't recommend coming here on a truly empty stomach as you might walk out with a huge dent in your wallet.  I shared a portion of the soup, (delicious!) two drinks, two entrees of curried lamb and scallops was well over $110 plus tax and tips.

The drink Citrus Mojito was refreshing and amazing! The food we had was for starters the shrimp and crab risotto which was so delicious it just melted in your mouth. Very flavorful as well as very beautifully cooked to perfection! My main entree was the Hong Kong Style Tuna with Lemon infused jasmine rice. I don't have the words to describe the Tuna and the overall dish!! If I can give it 100 stars I would! My fianc\u00e9 had the Colorado Lamb Saddle and he said that it was stupendously delicious!!! The best meal we have had in Vegas so far!!! Can't wait to come back as we decided to host our rehearsal dinner there!!"

So when another friend came into town for the weekend, I decided we should try it out based on their recommendations. \nI knew Spago was going to be pricy, but every dish was about $10 more than I was expecting still. A dish I expected (based on similar surrounding restaurants) to be about $35 was $45 and this was true across the menu. Because of that, we had to skip our appetizers. \nI had the short rib and my friend had the lamb chops. My short ribs were good, but didn't live up to the expectations I had (which were admittedly high). The flavor was great but they were the fattiest short ribs I've ever had so I had to cut large sections out. \nMy friend's lamb chops were fantastic but they came with risotto. This is when things went downhill. The risotto was forgotten at first. They then admitted the mistake and brought some risotto. However, the risotto they brought after they forgot it was undercooked - noticeably undercooked. We complained and they took it back and brought some new risotto. it seemed to be the same risotto but a helluva lot hotter. Maybe they just undercooked a large batch of risotto and scooped out some more undercooked risotto or maybe they just zapped it in a micro. We gave up on the risotto.\n\nThe service was another issue. The chef came out briefly and said how was our meal. He said this before we had gotten any food so he just turned and walked away. Very awkward. And we never had the same waiter. It was someone different doing everything so when we had the issue with the risotto it was very difficult to correct it.\n\nMaybe it was an off night, everyone I talk to seems to love it, and the food wasn't bad, just nowhere near as good as expected. But for that price, you shouldn't have an off night like that."

From start to finish the staff were great... no issues... and very informative. \n\nThe food...\n\nIf you haven't been to Spago, they have two menus. One is for fine dining, the other is for casual dining.  We went the fine dining route. \n\nI had the beef tar tare (a first for me) and it was delicious. My wife tried it and loved it as well. She had the white asparagus special.  Another winner of a dish.\n\nMain course...\n\nI had the American Wagyu steak, it was served on a bed of spinach and mushrooms. The side dish was a semolina fondue with black truffle.\n\nThe steak... it was sous vide @135 degrees for 72 hours.  It's hard to describe how amazing the steak was. It melted in your mouth like pork belly but with a great steak flavor. I was able to cut it with my fork. The texture and how it melts in your mouth is nothing short of amazing. I highly recommend you order this steak. Best steak I've had to date. \n\nMy wife had the roasted chicken with goat cheese which was on mashed potatoes and brown gravy. Comfort food galore! I tried it... loved it... she loved the meal as well. \n\nDeserts... \nI had chocolate bread pudding which also had passion fruit. This is where 1/2 a star was deducted. I thought the desert was tiny and the passion fruit didn't go well with the rest of the dish. \n\nMy wife had a peanut butter souffle. Another great dish... well worth ordering. \n\n\nAll in all we had a fantastic dinner with great food and great service. I would highly recommend you give this place a try. Do order the steak I mentioned... it's simply fantastic. \n\nA couple of drinks, a few bottles of water, appetizers, main course, desert = $240+$40 tip   $280 total. (ouch) but tasty."

The location, to some, is ideal if you're perusing around the Forum Shops & want a delightful meal, but for me, it's a pain in the rear to get there unless you're already inside Caesars.  And it's rather noisy since it's open to the Forum Shops.\n\nThe staff is always friendly!  I always go for lunch, (sit at the bar for the fastest service).  My fave is the chopped salad, all organic, fresh ingredients and the iced tea. I'm a picky tea snob and their passion flavored variety is deeeeeeeeeelish!!  It's a little pricey but worth it, I always get a to-go cup, they're happy to oblige.  They serve a bread basket upon seating and it's great, there's this one that has I think a cranberry in it, it's like crack. I normally end up requesting one more :)\n\nBut overall, it's a fresh, delicious restaurant that I definitely recommend. Go for lunch, you won't be disappointed."

Six hana oysters, a wood fired sausage pizza and 2 ice teas set me back 48 dollars, without tip. The tip was 20 percent as the service was attentive and professional. But the cost value vs quality is skewed, even by 11 dollar beer special in Vegas. \n\nBecause based on the round of appetizers, you are looking at 75$ to a 150$ a person, depending on drinks and deserts, and for that, I can hit any one of the solid 4 stars in Vegas and get satisfaction. If you want to lunch at a over priced legend, I suggest you try Emril's, I have a feeling it might deliver the bang I want for my buck. Oh... again, Pasta P quality on the wood fired pizza. Not terrible, but not much more than that. My yardstick for the wood fired pizza is Dephina's of San Francisco"

Casual dining is \"outside\" seating; whereas, fine dining is inside the restaurant. My friend and I chose the casual menu and were seated outside of the restaurant where we had a view of the shops, drunken tourists with yard longs, and the faux sky ceiling above us -- typical Vegas scenery. Dining within the outside area can get a little noisy, but not to the point where you can't carry on a conversation.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer and dessert to split and entrees of our own. \n\nAppetizer - Maryland Crab Cakes: We received two crab cakes made from fresh crab meat and paired with heirloom tomatoes. I never thought crab meat and tomatoes together would taste good, but they do in this case. \n\nEntree - Hand Cut Fettuccini: This was delectable. You really can't go wrong with freshly made pasta, arugula, and wild mushrooms. Shrimp and chicken can also be added, but for an additional cost (go for the add-on!).\n\nValrhona Chocolate Cremeux: A small, rich and decadent block of chocolate garnished with raspberries and edible gold-colored dust. A good dessert to finish off dinner.\n\nTea: I don't remember the name of the tea that I ordered, other than it was Japanese and its description mentioned \"fresh cut grass\" and \"ocean mist.\" It sounded intriguing, but it tastes and smells like ordinary green tea. *womp womp*\n\nOverall: The ambiance is more casual than my first Spago dining experience, but the food is just as superb and memorable (except for that tea..)."

We glanced at the menus for a number of places, but Spago's Cafe menu really jumped out at us. We asked for a reservation for 12 people at 6pm, but they told us 6:15 would be better. Fine by me. We sauntered back at the specified time, but had to wait about 15 minutes for our table to be ready. I also had to cut back the number since we couldn't pry all of the ladies away from shopping and the pool. \n\nI am so glad they have round tables! For larger groups, I love round tables, easier to talk, easier to see people... We were given the dinner menu, but since they are so nice, they allowed us to order from the cafe menu. Phewf... because I based all my choices on the cafe menu. Plus, the other ladies all ordered pizza and pastas. I opted for the wedge salad and the crab cakes.\n\nThey start to place our napkins on our laps... yikes, this is a fancy place. Then, they bring a plate with salt, butter and oil for our bread. Wait, where's our bread plate? Our server comes around with a huge bread plate to serve us. I was tempted to tell him to leave the whole plate. Too ashamed to ask, but we each asked for at least three slices of the different breads. I got the sourdough, the onion foccacia and some cracker-y bit. All good, better if there was more.\n\nAll the food comes at the same time. Our table is overloaded with food... my salad is in front of me, but my crab cakes need to be placed in front of my neighbour because on the other side, her fresh oysters and pizza are taking up all my space. The salad is pretty good and big... is it $14 good? Well, it's a decent wedge salad made spicy by the pepperoncinis around the wedges. It's hard to eat this dainty as I am not. I try to cut each bite before I put it in my mouth, but I get lazy and just slice the whole bit and pick at it. I know, I ordered it that way... but again... lazy. The crab cakes were really good though. They were tiny, but good. The outsides were crisp and the insides were jammed with tons of crab and almost no filler... there weren't huge lumps of crab, but nice shreads.\n\nSince I am stuffed to the gills with lettuce, I opt not to get dessert. Neither does anyone else. Since I made the reservation saying we were celebrating, they send over some beautiful chocolates with raspberry filling. Those were wonderful. I could see myself relaxing by the pool, popping these in my mouth all day long. I wonder if they sell them..."

We make it a point to eat here each time we go to Vegas, whether we win or lose, stay at The Flamingo, Planet Hollywood, Bellagio or Caesars. We have to. And the best part is that the menu is ever-evolving. \n\nDuring our last visit we had \n1. Oven roasted day boat Alaskan halibut\n2. Grilled Virginian line caught striped bass\n3. Creme Brulee \n4. Peach Tea\n\nFor our most recent visit, it was just as good. We had:\n1. Mediterranean sea bass\n2. California roll\n3. Stir fried shanghai style egg noodles.\n\nI loved my Alaskan halibut my last visit so i asked the waiter what was similar to it and he pointed me to the Mediterranean sea bass. it was not as soft/flaky as Chilean sea bass, but still good. It was served over a celery apple puree with celery hearts and huckleberry. It gave it an interesting, almost sweet flavor, but not what you would expect when hearing \"apple\" And I love how they prepare it in such a unique way that I know I won't likely find a dish like it anywhere else. \n\nThe California roll was excellent as well - nothing like any of the other California rolls I've tasted - for this, the authentic crab meat was marinated in a lemon vinaigrette. \n\nMy wife was quite pleased with her noodles, but was a little disappointed that it contained pork. After picking those pieces out though, it was delicious but a bit on the spicy side. \n\nWhat I failed to mention in my last review was the bread. We always look forward to it. A waiter comes by with a basket of four different kinds and a dish with butter, pepper, olive oil and salt. If you go, definitely try the cherry walnut bread - so good and just the right amount of sweet. The honey focaccia was tasty as well.  \n\nEach time I go there, I'm confident that whatever the chef puts on the menu is delicious. I'll continue going here as long as it's around and like I said before, if I could give it six or seven stars, I would. My all time favorite fancy restaurant."

It also came w. a mini trio of sea salt, butter, and olive oil on a cute tray separated into divisions. \n\nThe calamari was AMAZING. We order calamari at almost every restaurant we go to, and it was definitely to die for. I loved the crispiness and freshness of the calamari, and the garlic dipping sauce that it came with.  \n\nEntrees wise, I ordered the organic oven roasted chicken and the wood fired kobe beef burger. The chicken was a little bit on the dry side. I've had better at my university which is surprising. The kobe beef burger was good but the bun was a bit too much. The fries were also mediocre. \n\nService - our waiter was great. I tried ordering the duck that everybody on yelp raved about but He informed me that not only was it only really offered at dinner, but  he also said that in the future I could call in and order it before I arrived for lunch and they'd have it ready for me. \"Anything you want, we can do for you.\" he repeated twice and I really do believe that! Really really great service.\n\nSit outside so you can people watch while you eat. Lunch time is usually filled with a few business men, not too much tourists, so take advantage of lunch time. We were seated also right on the spot even though we didn't have reservations. \n\nHighly recommended for calamari and hopefully in the future I'll be able to try the duck as well. Very close to self parking at Caesars, and also close walk to the forum shops for you to stroll around and walk off the huge meal that you just ate. :]"

I've written 150 reviews to this point, and I've only given three 1 star reviews ever. So when I saw on my distribution graph that number went down to two, it was easy to figure out who removed one of them.\n\nLet's just keep this short and simple:\n-This was one of the top 3 worst dining experiences of my life.\n-You quoted us 45 min wait time for a party of 7, and we ended up waiting 2.5 hours.\n-When you finally sat us, you sat us at a circular table that was meant for two. This meant that when our food came, we let the girls crowd their plates onto the table, while the guys ate their food with their plates in their lap.\n-Luckily my plate wasn't very heavy, because I ordered the ravioli, and I only got like 4 pieces of ravioli. \n-The service was horrendously slow, and they just didn't seem to care. I think the whole dining experience took around 4 hours, so basically I was getting 1 piece of ravioli an hour for my experience.\n-This place wasn't cheap, and I can't figure out what I was paying for. It wasn't the service, it wasn't the food, and it wasn't the atmosphere.\n\nF U Spago. I came here like 7 years ago, and I'm still bitter. I remember to this day quite vividly every bit of my dining experience and how TERRIBLE it was."

I got the short ribs and it came real quick and was absolutely incredible... The ribs were amazingly tender and just melted in my mouth. The sauce on top of the ribs matched them perfectly and the gnocchi that came with it was well cooked and very chewy.\n\nThe food wasn't even the best part of the visit... Definitely thought the best part was the service. It seemed like our waiter was always RUNNING EVERYWHERE and when my glass was even slightly full, it quickly got refilled. In fact, there was a moment when the waiter actually bumped another customer because he was walking so fast. There was never a moment in which we felt neglected. \n\nAwesome place! Probably won't come here regularly because of the prices but I'd definitely come again for a special occasion!"

            "review": "I'd never been to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant before, so I was excited to try out Spago at Caesar's Palace on my recent trip to Vegas. Luckily I was there with family so I didn't have to pay.  :P  We had a reservation for ten people, including a two-year old and a seven-month old. Spago isn't exactly where you'd plan to take kids, but we didn't have a babysitter, so they had to come with us. We ate in the dining room, not the cafe, and the space was large and loud so the kids' noise didn't disrupt other diners. It was so loud, though, that us adults couldn't really talk to each other. We were seated at a large round table that forced us to yell at each other over all the noise. I was excited to see a Vegetarian Tasting platter on the menu, which I ordered. It came with four small dishes - all very pretty - and I was 75% happy with my meal. There was one dish, some sort of couscous, that tasted exactly like salt and nothing else. I was surprised and a little disappointed that a nice place like this would release such a tasteless dish from the kitchen, but  the rest of the dishes were awesome so they made up for it. The others were an eggplant timbale, portobello carpaccio, and artichoke canneloni. \n\nOne note - though it's not the most kid-friendly place, they did do a good job with the toddler in our party. He ordered a pizza, and they brought out a cheese pizza in the shape of Mickey Mouse! Very cute.\n\nThe service was great - very attentive wait staff and we had our water glasses refilled whenever necessary, without having to ask. My dad had told the server when we arrived that we needed to be out of there by 8pm (giving us two hours), because some of our party needed to head to the airport. The server did a great job of moving things along. \n\nI definitely recommend Spago, but I'd say it's better for smaller groups because of the noise level. Also, I liked that it's a nice restaurant but you don't feel like you have to get totally dolled up in your finest Vegas outfit - some people wore jeans. Not a snooty place at all."

He was very friendly, approachable and knowledgable about the food. We had the prosciutto salad and the beet salad. Both were well prepared. The beets tasted like they were lightly pickled which made this dish a little different from most beet salads I've tried. Entrees were shortribs and halibut. Both were tasty although I felt that my halibut was a tad dry and overcooked. The shortribs here beat out the ones I had at CUT in LA. They had a tinge more winey-ness to them. Dessert was good but the savory part or the meal stood out."

            "review": "Spago was pedestrian, at best!  I eat at many higher end restaurants throughout the year and I rarely write a review, but with my recent experience at Spago, I felt the need to warn others to not waste their money and time going to Spago in Las Vegas.  \n\nI vaguely remember going to Spago in Beverly Hills as a youngster with my parents and recall how food forward and posh it was 30 years ago, so I figured that going to Spago as an adult in Las Vegas was going to hold its own.  I was sorely mistaken.\n\nI was staying at the Aria and had reservations to see Absinthe (which was AMAZING!), so I chose to go to Spago because of the proximity and it's reputation.  We got there about 10 minutes late due to traffic, but they were very accomodating up front and sat us promply.  The restaurant was relatively uncrowded at the time (I believe it just opened for the evening), but they sat us in a table that was in the corner and right next to the doorway that the waiters use constantly between the kitchen and dining room.   I immediately noticed that this wasn't the seat for us, so we asked to be moved and they accomodated us, but I still wasn't sure why they chose this poorly placed table even though there were many tables open.  \n\nThe waiter was very pleasant and informative and I quickly told him that we had a show at 8pm and apologized for being late, but stressed that we wanted to be on time for the show.  He said that it would not be a problem at all to make the show on time and that we shouldn't worry at all.  Then he preceded to show us the wine/drink list and handed us an IPAD????  I thought this was very tacky for a \"high end\" restaurant.    We then were handed the menu, which had a nice assortment of dishes, but I didn't feel that the dishes were all that \"food forward\" and it didn't have many options for my vegetarian wife.  I asked him what are some of the \"signature\" dishes that he recommends and he said that it is a little cliche' to answer that question, but he reluctantly made a few recommendations.  He then gave the option to my wife of a vegetarian entree that the chef puts together himself and spoke of how wonderful that dish is and that he often recommends it to non-vegetarian diners.  I thought he was blowing a little smoke about that and the rest of his recommendations, but we made our order (3 courses as recommended) and kept our fingers crossed that we will have enough time to make the show.  They came with the bread plate options (which they claim were voted the best in Vegas), which were good, but nothing special. I liked that they continually came to the table and offered us more bread throughout the meal.  The waiters who filled your water was also very attentive, but borderline too attentive.  I would take a sip and he would quickly refill my water before I put the glass down.\n\nMy first course was the lobster salad....it was not good at all.  Minimal amounts of lobster (come on, this is VEGAS!!...I expected practically a whole tail for that price) and it was a very small dish and the flavors just didn't mesh.  It had the obligatory dots of sauce and a variety of \"fancy\" items on the plate, but I was underwhelmed.  My wife had the arugula salad, which she claims was the best part of the meal, but I still thought the price was too much.  Then there was a 15-20 minute gap between our first course and the second and I started to get a little nervous about the show and I thought the gap was just not timed right for the meal.  A large party then entered and I didn't see our waiter practically at all for the rest of the meal.  I found another waiter and stressed again that we are running a little late for the show and he talked to the kitchen to speed things up.  My second course was the seafood risotto which was not bad.  I then found our original waiter and asked for a diet coke, which he then forgot about and I didn't receive.  Another gap between our courses again and my wife and I started to get pretty disappointed that the kitchen wasn't being attentive at all to our situation.  Finally the main course came and I had the duck, which was also nothing special, a little fatty.  My wife's vegetarian dish just felt like an afterthought and we quickly had to scarf down our main dish to make the show.  My diet coke finally came after I asked another waiter and he said claimed that the soda dispenser was just being repaired which I felt was a lie.  I had to find yet another waiter to ask for the check and we quickly signed it so that we could make the show.  I would have loved dessert, but that was not in the cards anymore.\n\nAll in all, Spago in Las Vegas is completely underwhelming and not worth all the hype.  It was just as good as any other restaurant in a mall and I wouldn't waste my time going to this restaurant when there are so many other great ones in Vegas.  I'm still fuming that I could have made so many other quality choices."

Yes, this is a weird comment to make, and I'm not referring to the water glasses that are made from recycled wine bottles, but the glasses for wine and cocktails. With completely transparent giant blocks of ice (no white showing), the drinks in those glasses just looked magically elegant.

I guess I prefer restaurants that are totally cut off from casino action and have some connection to the outdoors. But this is not their fault!"

Don't know if I'm being ignorant here but that didn't quite compute. \n\nRegardless, on to the food. Started off with a glass of Cab - wish I could remember which one, and the beet salad. the salad was good (see pic), but definitley not as good as some I've had. It was presented nicely though and helped cleanse the palette. We then ordered a bottle of the syrah and dug into the main dishes. I had the hand-cut fetuccine with prawns. It was pretty tasty.

Vegas.\n\nMeh.\n\nThing is, when I am out of my San Francisco element, my obsession with trying something new, the latest and greatest, just....disappears. I'm out of my routine (i.e. gym), so I want to keep things simple. Which usually means a sandwich. If it's not in SF, I don't really care.\n\nBut I didn't have much choice. It was a business lunch, and everyone else was dying to go. Can't say much about the space other than it was relatively empty and cavernous, but I did enjoy my meal. The chopped veggie salad was a healthy eaters dream: carrots, celery, corn, green beans, and tomatos. Hold the cheese, and add the super expensive ($10) chicken. Even without dressing, there seemed to be some oil or something coating the veggies. Didn't need that, but it was minimal.\n\nService was flawless and intuitive. For example, suggesting to a co-worker steamed veggies when he didn't want potatoes. Nicely done. And don't miss the flatbread they bring out, or at least a piece.\n\nNot bad, kind of a stale environment, but dinner might have a better energy. And definitely go when you are not paying. As much as I liked my salad, were I paying $25 for it, not sure I'd be giving three stars."

Every time we go we are treated wonderfully, and the Chef, Eric Klein is always out talking to the diners, and leaving extra treats at the table.  Tonight's dinner was no different, except that we went for their 20th Anniversary dinner.  So, how can you make a great place even better?  Simple, serve a retro menu at prices from 20 years ago!!!   We had a great dinner...and far more than we could eat.  We started with the house smoked sturgeon on a crisp potato galette, topped with a dab of clavier.  It was a great balance of crisp, savory and salty and the portion was huge.  Of course we received a complimentary treat of squash stew, which was also a delicious start.  The layered beet and goat cheese Napoleon was perfect in execution and flavor...just a hint of acid from the beet and dressing.  We then received another unexpected treat from the chef of the lamb in lettuce wrap.  I have to admit that as I read the description it did not call out to me, but it was a great slightly spicy morsel, perfectly offset by the crisp buttercup lettuce.  We also tried the squash agnolotti with hazel nuts....perfect!  My wife ordered the yellow tail and being from Hawaii we are fussy about this dish.  It had a great sear, and was appropriately raw in the middle....as good as I have had anywhere, and nicely seasoned.  I had the lobster and spinach fettucini with black bean sauce.  I was afraid it might be a bit too dense, but again it was light, spiced nicely with a bit of heat, and great....but by that time we were so full I had to call for the doggy bag.   I am looking forward to a midnight snack!  This was a great evening at one of the standards of Las Vegas.  Loved the dinner, and loved the bill even more....with drinks about $100.   Try replicating that in 2012...."

Beautiful is the only word I can come up with to describe my evening here. \n\nI was dinning here with a large group for a business dinner with clients. I have an egg allergy which makes going out to eat difficult sometimes. To avoid the humiliation of asking the server a million questions in front of clients I had called ahead to see what was available to me to eat on the menu. \n\nThe hostess was very polite and then said she would direct me to the kitchen, she put me through to the head chef...at 5pm....on a Saturday, already amazing and unheard of service. He was one of the most caring strangers I have spoken with on the phone and told me he would accommodate anything I wanted to order to my allergy.\n\nWe arrived for dinner and the server was already informed of my allergy. I ordered an amaze balls Moscow mule and then the Chilean sea bass where the server carefully adjusted the entree to cater to my allergy needs. The food came out and everyone's entrees were stunning, and made for awesome conversation at the table. My bass was perfectly spiced, and honestly just perfect all around. \n\nWe got dessert and I had a bowl of fresh fruit, at this point the head chef actually came out of the kitchen to make sure everything was okay. He explained his wife has allergies so it always hits home for him. It was the best service I have ever experienced, and I think this type of gesture is unheard of and truly a rarity. \n\nThank you so much Spago for turning a potentially stressful dining experience into an extremely elegant and awesome evening, you guys are the sh*t."

The cafe menu prices are a little less expensive but the food is exceptional! In my party we had the salmon which was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The others in my group ordered a lobster and shrimp scampi dish that actually wasn't on the either menu (may have been a special). A little pricey but well worth it!"

I also had the salmon salad for an entree.  It was alright but for a dish trying to be asian fusion, it fell short on the Asian part.  It really tasted like a white chef trying his hardest to make an Asian dish though he has no idea what he's doing.  Service was satisfactory but my server could have been a little less intrusive of my conversations and more attentive to filling my water glass which was ridiculously small (even for desert conservation standards).  For a Strip joint of WP caliber, I would expect a manager presence and a table touch even for a slow afternoon, but didn't see any.  I guess they don't really care."

What more can you ask for?\n\nKeep in mind I generally don't write reviews unless I am really compelled to do so, hence this is only my second review on here.\n\nBefore our drive out to Vegas with about 15 friends, we contemplated on where we should eat. As you know, the strip has no shortage of restaurants and to be honest, we always go food hunting in Vegas with two notions in mind, any decent restaurant is pricey and the food is not the greatest. After all, you are in the middle of the desert, right?\n\nA friend highly recommended Spago so we decided to give them a call and make the reservation. Upon arrival, we literally stepped one foot into the restaurant and headed straight to our seats. This wouldn't be a big deal normally but the restaurant was packed and normally you wait forever in Vegas. The table was immaculate and our servers were very quick to ask us what beverages we would like. Alcohol of course, easy on the rocks.\n\nThey bring around a bread tray for you to select from four different types of breads, all very soft and flavorful, along with a plate with four spread/dipping options. Very nice attention to detail. We ordered some appetizers to begin with, the oysters were fabulous and so was the sweet fig flat bread, wow!\n\nNow on to the main courses. There is an entree on this menu for every palette. If you like slow cooked beef that melts in your mouth, go with the Red Wine Braised Boneless Short Rib Beef. The Filet Mignon also looked hearty and tasty. Being that it is a Wolfgang restaurant, a buddy of mine couldn't help but to order their sausage plate which he \"killed\" and cleared the plate. They also offer spaghetti and some asian fusion dishes, which I tried the bean curd noodles and they were money! \n\nThe servers were very attentive, the food came out nice and hot, and on time. The General Manager, Michael Schwarz came by and made sure our needs were all met, in which case we did not hesitate to thank him for such a great time. He really has that place running smooth and we won't hesitate to go back or recommend this place to all of our friends. \n\nThank you Michael and the crew!"

Honestly, the name Wolfgang Puck is what caught my eye and even after we passed by it and walked to another nearby restaurant the food description at Spago just sounded so much yummier. I'm so glad we decided to give it a try. Our server was knowledgeable with the wine selection and the food choices. Like I said we were hungry so for appetizer we had a Margherita Pizza and each of us had a pasta meal. Can't recall the names but mine was crab meat with fettuccine in a spicy sauce. Utterly amazing. When the plate comes the pasta is so tightly coiled in the middle you think you are getting only a handful but once you start digging in it opens up and you find a very generous portion of food! Service, food and price were much better than i anticipated. Highly recommend you check it out!"

The sushi was fresh and tasty, but that's to be expected from a high end restaurant bearing Wolfgang Puck's name...so to me, that's not nearly enough to merit a high rating.\n\nI, on the other hand, ordered a \"Schnitzel,\" or something.  I was expecting something along the lines of a gourmet sausage, but when it came it looked like a flattened piece of lean Tonkatsu.  However, I was mildly intoxicated which usually gives just about anything an upgrade in the taste department.  This however, just oozed average in about every aspect.  \n\nThe portions were generous for a fancy place like Spago, but I was just so unimpressed by the meat.  One of the signature dishes I make in my home kitchen is Tonkatsu, and I would take mine over the \"Schnitzel\" any day of the week, even if it was competitively priced at $8.95 plus tax for an identical meal.  I think mine was in the $30-something range.\n\nNo one else at the table raved about their food either, so I doubt I'll find myself ever returning here on my future Vegas endeavors."

We were greeted by both of them, which was pretty cool. \n\nThe front of the restaurant has a more casual vibe with the open pseudo-patio facing the Forum shops. We were led to the back of the restaurant which was the fine dining area. I immediately noticed Sinatra playing in the background, which I love. We basically had a phenomenal 5 or more tastings prior to our chosen individual main entree.  The sommelier suggested an amazing red wine from Santa Rita Hills: Gypsy Canyon... And I thought I was done with Pinot Noirs, but this wine was atypical for a Pinot Noir. It wasn't light, but more medium body and fruit forward. It paired beautifully with everything we ate. So I can't recall the order of what was presented to us... Tuna sashimi, amazingly fresh scallop, flavorful fennel soup... I admit I should have written this last week, because I can't recall each & every dish.  My main entree that I chose was the grilled French sea bass which was absolutely delicious!  And dessert was decadent influences of chocolate... each of the 3 or 4 types of pastry was out of control... sinfully scrumptious!\n\nWe were definitely spoiled with exceptional delectable dishes and outstanding service."

If you would like to know what my experience with Spago was that night, read on.\n\nMy date and I were staying at Caesars and he wanted dinner so we went downstairs to the Forum Shops. He asked 2 random employees in the mall if they could pick a restaurant to have the most delicious dinner ever, here inside the Forum Shops, which restaurant would it be. Spago was a unanimous decision. \nWe were promptly seated by a lovely waitress. I don't remember her name but she was Caucasian, had brown/auburn wavy hair, and wore glasses. My date told our waitress we wanted a 4 course meal and for her to pick nothing but the best for us and to keep it a secret until it is served. He paid our waitress her tip ($50) right then and there entrusting her judgement. She leaves after taking our drink orders (Bombay sapphire martini with 3 olives and a cup of coffee) and my date tells me he sure hopes our waitress knows he wants both soup and salad so I tell him he should let her know just in case. When he tells her about wanting both soup and salad, she says the soup of the day is white bean and she doesnt think we would enjoy it. Good call!! This was perhaps the highlight of my meal.\nA basket of bread came out consisting of cracker thin bread with Parmesan and other herbs baked ontop, sliced raisin bread, and our favorite, focaccia w onions ontop. We finished most of the bread and asked for another basket before our appetizer of crab cakes came out from our server. The crab cakes were absolutely delicious and our waitress comes by to check up on us. She was absolutely fantastic. Our server comes by with the second basket of bread. My date and I were both enjoying the focaccia until he finds a strand of HAIR in his. He motions the server to come over and we show him the bread. At first he doesn't see it because it was still a little bit baked inside of the bread so I pull on the strand until he sees it. He told us, \"sorry, I will bring you a new basket.\" At this point, we were too disgusted with not only eating more of their bread, we completely lost our appetites. My date and I tell our waitress we are \"done\" and she apologizes countless times. Her boss is there (petite and blonde) and asks our waitress if she could look at our bill. The manager decides that we don't owe them anything for our dinner. I found this notion a little insulting. We had just been disgusted by finding a strand of HAIR in the food they served us! Besides, we only had a basket of bread, crab cakes, and we didn't even finish our drinks! Our waitress gave us the $50 tip we gave her in advance apologizing at the same time. My date gave her back $25 because she deserved it and had she known, she would've handled the situation better.\n\nI expected a lot more from a Wolfgang Puck establishment. This has got to be one of the worst dining experience I ever had. But I sure wish I could remember the name of our waitress because I'd like to give credit where credit is due. She was very knowledgeable in the menu and fine dining and also very personable."

My mom kept commenting on how there were more waiters then customers for a Saturday night, but we did originally get there around 5:45pm and the dining room eventually filled up and was almost full when we left two hours later (we ate leisurely and had coffee with dessert after our entrees).\n\nBefore our entrees came out, we were given a plate of olive oil, sea salt, pepper, and butter for some artisan breads that were served by a waiter (whose only job it seemed was to serve bread). The selection was quite diverse with an onion foccacia, an herb & cheese lavash, sourdough, cherry walnut bread, and pretzel bread. I tried one of everything and would have eaten more if I didn't know were were going to get our appetizer and entrees soon.\n\nSpeaking of entrees, I ordered the New England Diver Sea Scallops with three giant scallops that were perfectly cooked. It was topped with a mascarpone foam that was pretty to look at and fun on the plate, but had little taste. However, the flavors of the rest of the dish definitely made up for that. My brother had a taste and mentioned that he would have eaten 10 of those scallops instead of his entree. The appetizer we ordered was a special one not on the menu, and I am so happy with our choice. We got persimmon and prosciutto flatbread with fromage blanc... it was heaven. I don't know how they made the crust so light, crisp, and airy, but I would go back just for that.\n\nMy brother ordered the Choucroute Garnie Royal that comes with mustard, sauerkraut, blood sausage, regular sausage, chicken sausage, and pork belly. He couldn't stomach the blood sausage (and neither could I) but the rest of the sausages were decent. Edible, but not amazing. My brother wishes he would have tried the duck... I do too because it sounded great on the menu!\n\nMy mom ordered the Grilled French Sea Bass Loup de Mer, and it was amazing! The portion was very generous and the grilled onions and artichoke under the fish itself complemented very well with the dish. She loved her dish so much, she didn't even want to try any of our food.\n\nMy dad ordered the Chilled Maryland Blue Crab Salad because he was still semi full from an earlier meal. I'm SO glad he was full because he would have ordered chicken or steak and we would have missed out on this yummy dish! Each bite of crab, avocado, and grapefruit was like a party in my mouth. The flavor combo is not one I would have ever put together, but it was on point!\n\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate souffle with ice cream. The ice cream was delicious, but the souffle was not my favorite.\n\nOh, I almost forgot... the best part about the dining experience at Spago was the little things they did to set them apart from other restaurants. First, my glass of water was never half filled, it was always full. Second, they gave us complimentary parsnip soup with truffle oil. Third, around the time the bill came, the waiter produced a mini plate of chocolate petit fours."

The food was decent, but the unfriendly service is what killed it for us.\n\nI don't think we'll be back."

We sat pretty close to the kitchen.... for a minute I thought I was at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant and we were on TV,  as the uncomfortably loud yelling from the chef almost had us get up and leave the establishment. I love the passion and appreciate they want the food to come out right, but I prefer a better atmosphere then eating at a yelling match. \nThe server was really nice, but we arrived at 6:40 and the people seated after us were done 30 minutes before us. We received our meal at 7:45 and weren't to thrilled about the long wait. It was seriously getting to the point were I was about to politely ask the server what was taking so long\nThe complimentary bread was def a good thing and held us over. \nThe app was the Tempura Shrimp with some sort of lime cilantro cole slaw $12 (?). I def liked it .....though it wasn't anything too out of the normal. \nI ordered the Lamb which was cooked perfectly and vegetables were mouth watering. I'm just not sure I'd pay $36 again for that. \nThe duck was somewhat overcooked, unseasoned and dry... Though everything else on the plate was terrific. \nI'm glad Spago offered this menu\nI'm not sure if we got the short end of the stick this night but I've eaten at less known places with a better experience and better food as well. I would not want to pay for the Wolfgang Puck price and experience if this were to be my outcome again. I truly wish this would have been a better review."

That couldn't have been further from the truth.\n\nWe were in Vegas to celebrate our daughter's 21st birthday and the 21st birthday of her friend.\n\nThe dinner started with an introduction of the waitstaff.  He wanted to know if we were in a hurry or wanted a leisurely dinner.  Since we didn't have show tickets we requested a leisurely dinner.\n\nThe wine list was notable and the waitstaff were very familiar with the items on the list.  Our first bottle was an older vintage so the waiter aerated and strained it to take the sediment out.  He was very nice and explained what he was doing to the young drinkers at the table.\n\nWe started with the shrimp cocktail, Pumpkin Agnolotti (Mascarpone, Parmesan Reggiano, French Burgundy Truffles) and Porcini \"Bacon & Eggs\" (Pecorino Romano, Semolina, Confit Egg, Pancetta).  The \"Bacon & Eggs\" is the house specialty.\n\nThe shrimp were huge and wonderfully tasty.  The agnolotti was the crowd pleaser with a great holiday flavor profile.  The Bacon & Eggs was my personal favorite.  The use of the semolina with the confit egg and pancetta was delightful.\n\nThree of us had duck and my husband had the shoulder of lamb.  The meat was cooked to perfection.  The side items were as flavorful and inviting as the entree.  We had a good time trying to identify the purees, etc and when we asked for a menu to determine if we were correct, it was unnecessary because the waiter, Jeremy, was fully versed in each item and could answer all our questions.\n\nThe birthday girls ordered the chocolate cremieux with raspberry coulis.  They both said it was the best chocolate dessert they had ever eaten.\n\nWe were gifted with the petit four sampler which was a passion fruit marshmallow and a Chinese five spice chocolate.  None of us like marshmallows but we all liked these.  They were moist and flavorful.\n\nAt one point during the dinner the waiter asked the chef to drop by our table.  I don't know if he was caught off guard or just doesn't like this aspect of his job because he basically said hello and walked off.  In this world of celebrity chefs, etc. he may want to work on his table side manner or stay in the kitchen.\n\nThe service overall was outstanding!  They made a 3-hour meal fly by.  I did think the constant hovering of the management staff was a little bit of overkill given the superb service by the waitstaff but since it is working, who am I to judge.\n\nI will definitely return to this restaurant and keep my eye on Chef Klein."

            "review": "Spago continues to be one of the finest restaurants in Las Vegas.  The biggest change in the Vegas restaurant scene in the last 5 years is the proliferation of Name/Celebrity Restaurants.  The trend that Wolfgang Puck and Emeril started 25 years ago has exploded with very mixed results.  Prices have gone through the roof, quality has diminished and many of the new 'name\" restaurants treat you as though they are doing you a favor by allowing you to eat there.  Not so at Spago.  Some how they have been able to keep the same creativity, commitment to excellent food and outstanding service that they brought to Vegas a quarter of a century ago.  Perhaps it is because the General Manager, Carlos, is an ever present force.  Keep an eye on him; he is at the check in desk, behind the bar, in the kitchen,  at your table or seeing you off as you leave.  Nothing happens at the Spago without him being aware.  Contrast this with the snooty teenagers who have become the face of far too many expensive restaurants.  Spago is not cheap...but it is not expensive either.  Expect to pay about $40 per person on the patio (which is still the best people watching spot in Vegas) or about $65 per person inside.  But after far too many $250 a person meals, that are many times less than mediocre, when deciding where we want to go for a special occasion we often choose Spago."

All of it was really good, the sourdough, pretzel, and cranberry walnut were our favorite!\n\nService is top notch here!

I have only ever gone here for lunch, which was pretty good with decent prices, but for dinner:\n\nSeafood appetizer special: Very pricy...there was four of everything (oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktail, and a spoonful of crab salad). Not worth the $ in my opinion, but the food was indeed fresh and quite delish.\n\nHong Kong style salmon: Being of hong kong descent, it didn't really taste \"Hong Kong\" to me...had a weird twang from the soy sauce. Salmon was very soft and cooked just right though. Vegetables had the same weird twang, but was still edible.\n\nSea bass: Yum! I got mine gluten free (yes, gluten allergy sucks!) And the waiter reassured my terrified little brain that they dealt with allergies of all kinds all the time and that they would be sure to keep my gluten allergy in mind. So my meal is a bit different from the usual...it really consisted of an excellently cooked sea bass with a bunch of buttery chopped greens on the bottom. Pretty good.\n\nDiver scallops: Came with this cool foam on top. Scallops I felt could be cooked to a more golden tone, but it was still good. I kept biting in some sand or something though.\n\nThe meals were way too pricey for the amount we got, but I guess in classier restaurants, that's just the way it is! Presentation was amazing and everything was cooked to perfection. Employees were very professional and friendly...I'd come here again, but maybe for lunch so my wallet won't implode."

I had a bite and half the burger broke off and fell into a greasy pile on the plate.\n\nMy daughter's chicken fingers were probably the best tasting item on our table that afternoon... and i should hope so at $15 for a lunch time kid's meal.\n\nDessert was a disaster.\nWe ordered the Pineapple abomination; their take on Pineapple Upside-Down Cake a la mode, I suppose.  It was a square of dry, crumbly yellow cake topped with 3 preparations of pineapple, all sitting a top a pile of mint and mystery nut \"pesto\".  The best part was likely the lime-coconut sorbet.\n\nI wish I remembered the servers name so that I could rip him a new one in this forum.  The hostess sat us in a corner (probably due to our 2 1/2 year old? i dunno) where we were ignored/forgotten for maybe ten minutes. After our order was taken we were ignored for the remainder of our meal.  No server stopped to see how everything was or if everything tasted OK.  He didn't even offer us dessert, he just assumed we wanted the check.  It wasn't until the end of the meal that he struck up a conversation, \"Hey, where are you guys visiting from?\"  I told him we lived here and my companion cut me off and carried on the conversation knowing some smart-ass comment was bubbling up inside of me.  As soon as the guy found out where we worked he was our best friend! \"OMG! That would be my dream job! Let me take the dessert off!

Definitely a tense atmosphere. \n\nHOWEVER, I can't deny that the service WAS perfect and so was the food.\n\nThe food was incredible, thanks to the head chef Dillon who was working the night we came in. Everything was cooked to perfection. So creative and I ate every bite. Even the bread basket was incredible and so tasty."

My friends were also very satisfied with their dishes. \n\nGreat atmosphere, nice waitress, good service. We had reservations for a bachelorette party of 12 and everything went smoothly! There was a time we were waiting quite some time for our bill, but I think that was because our bride-to-be received a special dessert and we received complimentary truffles, thanks Spago!"

Then again, I was with 5 teenagers that didn't drink any and were complaining a lot and didn't know much about food. \n\nWe ordered the truffle risotto and ricotta gnocchi. The truffle risotto had these wonderful pieces of shaved black truffle on top. So delicious and truffle-y. The ricotta gnocchi was so good too. I love gnocchi so definitely enjoyed the flavor of everything. It was like tomato sauce with some delicious food. \n\nI ordered the steak and really enjoyed it. They cooked it beautifully and the accompaniments to the steak were really enjoyable too. I got to try my brother's cod and that was definitely really good. \n\nThe food was really good, but the service that I got was not good at all. I know that a 25 year old and 5 teenagers aren't your typical group of people there, but I wish they came by more often. I feel like we were being ignored - when we were trying to order and even after we got our food. My water was almost always half-full. \n\nOverall, good food, not so great service."

It was plain boring and lacked any intensity.\n\nService....Bleah!\n\nSerious WP, do you just want to say you have a bunch of restaurants in Vegas or do you really care what your restaurants are actually serving?   I get it.  Tourist trap, lots of foot traffic....easy money.  Yeah you don't care."

This is a solid go to place for nicely prepared food in the middle of the tacky but fun, Caesars Palace Forum.  I always opt for the patio (inside under a fake blue sky...only in vegas) cuz  love to watch the wandering herds of tourists when there might be a pause in the food service. Love the peeping tom perch and diversion. i digress. Service is pretty consistant and just the right amount of attentiveness. Food is VERY consistant. Our last visit my spousal unit had the schnitzel and it was fabulous. Truly a feast for the eyes and tummy. All the other entrees at our table were enjoyed and the bread basket was a huge hit. Dunno....just like the consistency and the nicely prepared and predictable Puck fare. Nothing flashy or cutting edge. Just nice and tasty at a decent price with a great location to people watch. I hope it never changes.............."

The bad is that service has dropped over the last several years. I am encouraged that others in this string of reviews have seen the same - it means this is not unusual. I sat at the bar counter. Lots of space, and lots of crumbs. Should have been a red flag to me that crummy service was headed my way. I took a coaster and scrapped off the crumbs from the counter. Emily (the bartender and server - she did neither very well) took a wet cloth and wiped down my space (but not the other areas around me - that came much later). Shen she ran the wet rag, some of the crumbs that remained fell in my lap. I am a big guy - not hard to miss me. Unless of course you just don't care, and Emily did not care. \n\nThe folks down the way from me had some more exotic dishes, so that is where Emily spent her time. Good for her - capitalism is alive with Emily. But service at Spago suffers, and so does the image. \n\nYou bet I will be back because the food is good. But there will be a breaking point where I say, this isn't worth the negative or neutral service experience."
