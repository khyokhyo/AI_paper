            "review": "Today was our first time eating here. My father lives this place and raves about it. So we decided to try it out before we left town, being we are from California. The service we received was exceptional. There were a few issues with the food but that was due to the cook not paying attention to the order properly. Took 5 times to get my wife's food right. The manager came over and took care of the issue and had no problems from there on. The food is amazing and will definitely be coming back next time in town."

The friendly staff takes the edge off and then they lay down a platter of food that makes you wonder if your eyes may be too big for your belly (not me, I'm a fat kid at heart).  \n\nI do wish they served alcohol but I guess no one is perfect.  Highly recommend that you grab a dessert to go.  Made fresh in house, they are simply amazing.  We got the chocolate cream pie last time... wow.  Couldn't decide if I wanted to eat it or make sweet love to it."

Once we sat down, they got our drinks and then a little while later, we got our order taken and got our food shortly there after. Service was great and friendly. Food was pretty good and hearty. If you want something away from the strip, we would recommend going here. Eggs Benedict was pretty good as well as the waffle and eggs combo. Although the waffle could have been a bit crispier. Other than that, great food and service!"

It was hard to choose what I wanted to eat because there were so many tempting items. I got the Bigfoot Chicken fried steak and it comes with soup or salad and a corn bread muffin I chose a salad with ranch which I must say was very tasty ranch and the muffin was so sweet and soft. You also get a choice of sides I  ordered the red skinned mashed potatoes and baked beans let me tell you I have never had baked beans that good they were sweet and spicy and had sausage and bacon in them mmm mmm good. Now on to the main dish the chicken fried steak it was tasty fried goodness covered in homemade gravy the meat was very good quality this is definitely the best chicken fried steak I have ever had.\n\nNot only was the food absolutely delicious but the service was excellent and the price was right.\n\nI cant wait to return to this restaurant there are so many other delicious looking items I wanna try."

            "review": "Yes. Yes. and YES this place is pretty darn awesome.\n\nAs a country\\chicken fried steak connoisseur, I must mention that everything you may have heard is true - they DO have great chicken fried steak. Every bite is worth EVERY calorie. Eachtime I've come here in the past year (I'd say over 10 times), I tell myself that I will try something else on the menu. Um, I haven't - I CAN'T!!! I feel ordering something else will deprive me of the opportunity to enjoy one of my favorite breakfasts.\nMy husband especially loves that they have a \"Hungry Bear's Breakfast\" section - he hates it when he can't get a big breakfast! Even though the chicken fried steak (big foot version - of course) is his all time favorite, he loves The Grizz too.\nAll the food is hot and fresh --but most importantly - consistent!!! That's a biggie.\n\nI love the owner\\host guy that is there every time we walk in and seats us. He is the cutest old guy in the world. Every time we come in he gives us the warmest welcome and has this adorable smiling face. I keep telling my husband - I swear I just want to give that guy a hug.\n\nThe wait staff seems to have been working there forever.. They know everything on that menu front and back. The service is always top notch. \n\nWe haven't been there for any other time except breakfast but we have been meaning to and probably will in the near future. I would recommend signing up for their loyalty program - you get great deals via email that are hard to pass up.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place!!! It's worth a drive to check it out!"

The food always comes in gigantic portions, so make sure you're hungry when you go. \n\nThe restaurant is decorated like a Mountain Lodge, and reminds me of something that would be in Northern California. I think that's where the first Black Bear was started. \n\nThe menu looks like an old newspaper from the 50s, and there's so many things to choose from. The Portuguese Linguisa (sausage) excellent and they have the best coffee. There's nothing like good, hearty, home style cooking."

            "review": "Wanted to LOVE this place so bad as it is right around the corner from my new apartment. I'll start out by saying I will be back to give it another try in the future. A buddy of mine met up with me here for dinner a few nights ago and we were both in the mood for breakfast (+1 for ALL DAY BREAKFAST!)\nI had to laugh as we didn't realize that the small newspaper that was put on the table actually was the menu! The waitress came to take our order and we asked for menus. She looked at us kind of funny and laughed. Honest mistake! lol\nAnyway, my food was decent. I ordered the Volcano (pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage) and my buddy ordered some dish with eggs, home potatoes, Portuguese sausage and a biscuit. His food came out warm at best and his potatoes seemed a bit overcooked and lacking flavor. My pancakes were good, eggs were eggs, the sausage was eh and the bacon was terribly overcooked and dry.\nThe decor is fun, cheesy and could possibly be a bit frightening if you are not a fan of bears or stuffed animals.\nAll in all, not a horrible experience and seeing as it serves breakfast all day and it's right around the corner I will probably be here more than a few times. Hopefully other menu items are better and I'll update my review from there."

Crust was hard and it was a pain to eat. \n\nI did get the Grizz on my first visit but ehhhhh. I'm gonna try the country fried steak next time. \n\nIn terms of service, it's not too shabby but not exceptional either."

All of the servers that worked that night were great. There were customers coming in asking for their favorite servers. I was raised in the restaurant business and this diner reminds me of what good old fashioned food and customer service is all about. Keep up the good work. Also, if you go into a restaurant and the line is out the door, their must be a reason for it.\n       John R.\n        Las Vegas, Nv."

But it's not close to where I live.  \n\nI was surprised to find a Free Entree Coupon in my email recently.  I guess I signed up for their restaurant club and they sent me a coupon for my birthday... how sweet.  \n\nSo I decided to place a couple entree orders and pick it up for dinner for myself and my girlfriend, driving out of my way, but hey, a free meal is nice these days.\n\nTo my disappointment, the cashier, while checking me out indicates that I can only use my Free Entree Coupon for Dine In.  But that fine print is ultra fine and tiny, on the 3rd line at the very bottom of the email.  \n\nI don't know about you but I am really tired of being TRICKED into visiting an establishment and being forced to partake in a dining experience not of my preference.\n\nIt's very easy to be transparent with customers and that is what I appreciate.  Anything else is excruciatingly frustrating.\n\nI can't see returning."

But the big story..was that, as luck would have it, I dropped my keys in their parking lot and didn't find out about it until I got back to California(!)  So we call the diner and lo and behold, the Diner has my keys.  I gave them my information and 3 days after my dumba** loses them, the good people at Black Bear Diner mail my keys back to me, insisting I NOT reimburse them for the postal charges!  The manager there, Ray, was understanding, helpful and completely professional.  Not only was the food awesome, the \"service\" was outstanding.  ..Cant thank them enough."

My bacon and eggs were good but I did not care for their pancakes. The pancakes were very sweet; too sweet for me. The pancakes were too fluffy. They fell apart when I put my spoon through it. They actually melted in your mouth. On the other hand my husband ordered the Fiesta scramble with red potatoes and his food was pretty good. I give his breakfast a 3 1/2 star. Our meal came up to 33 dollars and some change. I will need to revisit this place, order something else, and review it again. Remember, this is just my opinion on my breakfast; I am sure that there are other things on the menu that taste great."

Inside this place would remind you of a log style cabin with homey fixtures and memorabilia that is black bear related. Me and my cousin came in and I had the chicken fried steak and he had the meatloaf. Not the best chicken fried steak I've had but it was good and the some of the side veggies were burned (zucchini, squash, & broccoli). Having a small bite of the meatloaf it was tasty, tender and well seasoned. Service was quick at first but after the food was dropped the waitress was no where to be found for refills."

I just had French toast with a side of bacon and a glass of orange juice and would give zero stars if the Oj wasn't good. \n\nThe French toast was made out of a bear claw pastry and then battered and fried, it was disgusting and not what I was expecting. \n\nThe bacon was the driest piece of bacon I've ever had my life.

We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken. Our drinks got to us in a timely manner. The guy that brought our drinks said the server would be with us shortly - \"shortly\" seemed to be longer than expected.\n\nThe waitress finally came and took our order. At this time, i asked the waitress for an orange juice for my daughter which she said she would bring out (it didn't come until i asked again for the orange juice once our food finally arrived - she didn't come back to our table from the time we ordered until we got our food). I would've hoped for a bit better service, since i was waiting on refills for my coffee and my water. \n\nThe food was very good, I ordered the Hobo Joe Omelette. I will give this place another chance since the food was very good, hopefully i do get better service on my next visit.\n\nI liked the atmosphere and decor as well. Very casual place where you can eat and relax."

For breakfast, Stephen and I have found many hidden gems located no more than 10-15 minutes from the Strip.  On this visit, I suggested coming to the Black Bear Diner located off Tropicana Avenue.\n\nBlack Bear is a restaurant chain that started in Mt. Shasta, California with locations in the western part of the United States, such as Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.\n\nOn weekends, they do get crowded, but fortunately we came on a weekday, and was seated right away at 9:30 am.  The restaurant is \"bear themed\" and the portions are lumberjack sized.  They do offer a a few menu items for seniors or those who are light eaters, and the portions are still very generous.\n\nWe had dinner plans at 7:00, so we didn't want to fill up with a huge breakfast.  We decided on the \"Mini Volcano\" which is 2 pancakes, bacon and/or sausage, plus an egg for $8.99.  The pancakes are made with a sweet cream, which I ate without syrup.  They reminded me of the taste of a fortune cookie, with a hint of vanilla.\n\nService was friendly, and there's plenty of free parking."

It's a family friendly restaurant and I'm not sure if the southern accents are real but they're cute. We were seated immediately but it was about 9 on a Wednesday so I can't tell you for sure if they ever get super busy but I have a feeling they do. The location is about 4 miles from where we stayed off the strip so it's not a terrible drive.\n\nThe hostess who sat us didn't really help us much because we hadn't been there and we were confused as to why we didn't get menus but they are in the paper (actual newspaper looking) she sat us with. So that was cute.\n\nWe ordered the classic eggs benedict and the country fried steak. Both super delicious. Hand down the best chicken fried steak because the batter is so light and you can cut the steak with the butter knife. Anthony chose to have a biscuit with his meal which was light and fluffy and delicious with both butter and jelly. My eggs benedict we delicious and I had never had it with slices of ham instead of a ham steak and that was yummy because I got more ham with my bite. They also come with a bowl of fruit and hash browns which were crispy on top and fluffy in the middle.\n\nBoth dishes were delicious and we can definitely see ourselves coming back."

The food was very good with huge servings, but.... Cindy, our server, began cheery and friendly but ended up not meeting our needs. We look over their super, cute newspaper menu and decide what each of us want to order, she takes our orders, but before she leaves to put the order in, she all of the sudden remembers that the biscuits won't be ready for 20 minutes! :( WHAT?! A few of us had ordered the biscuits and gravy, now we have to re-order! :( So, she brings out the order, well.... \"most\" of the food...a few of us had to wait an additional 5 minutes for our food (didn't order anything special). Something was cooked incorrectly (cooks fault) so now that person has to wait another TEN minutes for their food. It was ridiculous!        NOTE: There were 7 adults, no kids, no unreasonable demands on food preparation....it just wasn't an good experience for us at this location; however, we would still HIGHLY recommend visiting a (different location) Black Bear Diner!\n\nVisited October 2016"

You were arrogant and rude you yelled at your poor waitress who was trying so desperately to accommodate to her full area. Everyone was upset! You them tell me nd other customers that our meal would be comped which it wasnt. Now the thing that truly upset me was our poor waitress was so upset she was crying. She was  apologizing for the service since the other waitresses were grabbing her food and she couldn't provide the service she wanted....never ever put down your staff in front of clients!!!\n\nHorrible service not because of the waitress but because of management!!!! \n\nFire DON hire someone that knows what he is doing, maybe then he can stop comping out meals!!!!!!

We live in the neighborhood and come here about once a month and it feels like home. \nThe service is amazing and consistent, everyone is always so friendly if just a couple of us, or the whole fam. The food is awesome, the menu is everything you would expect from an old school diner, simple food cooked by someone cares. The burgers are always great, the sandwiches are as well. The breakfast is damn near perfect, I don't think my kids have ever even tried anything else due to this, and we usually eat here at dinner time! \nI usually try different things when I eat here and have recently found my hands down favorite, the Blazin Bear! Pulled pork with their special spicy sauce that I had a hard time believing wasn't candy, it was just so good! I grabbed the waiter after my second bite to tell him it was amazing. He was grinning from ear and was almost excited telling me it was his favorite thing on the menu. Even the cole slaw on it tasted great....and I detest cole slaw!\nThey also have great dessert, the pies are all pretty tasty. The coffee is pretty good, too. Kids eat free on Teddy Bear Tuesdays, our kids even brought in Teddy bears the first time we went on that day and they are still up on the shelf after the years. \nIt's great to have an old school neighborhood dinner actually in my neighborhood!"

It was amazing. The buttery, lightly toasted sourdough bread was stuffed with a savory shrimp salad and, of course, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. There was so much shrimp, it fell from the sandwich with every bite, still leaving plenty inside the bread. It was one of the most flavorful sandwiches I've ever had. On the side, was a cup of fresh cole slaw that was not too sweet and not too tart, but just right. I highly recommend this sandwich, but the Shrimp Specials will only be offered during the summer. So I may rush back to try the other shrimp plates!"

A suggestion to the management would be to get a bench for the outside area.\nAmbience: very informal, very casual. Decorated in early \"bear\" - photographs of bears, stuffed bears, and sayings about bears decorate the walls all around the restaurant. Just about the right tone for a place to go for a family brunch.\nFood: my wife and I shared a California omelet and the bear claw french toast. The California omelet add sauteed mushrooms, melted cheese, avocado, and other goodies folded into what appeared to be a 3 egg omelet. Fabulous!!! This had to be the best California omelette I've had in any breakfast place in a very long time. The bear claw french toast came with butter and syrup. It was stuffed with almond flavoring. Incredibly sweet. You certainly don't need the syrup on this one. A delicious second course to follow up the omelette.\nService: our server was very friendly and very welcoming. Unfortunately we got there during the Sunday morning rush and she was spread way too thin. Service was a little slower than I would have liked. However I was not in a rush and this did not significantly detract from the meal. I will definitely come back here again for a family brunch. An excellent meal at a very reasonable price. And very family friendly."

They even have their own brand of hot sauce with three different heat levels (Baby, Mama, and Papa Bear with habanero).  \n\nIt was, hands down, the best restaurant breakfast I've had in years.\n\nPricewise, you will pay similar prices at IHOP or Pancake House, and their food doesn't even compare.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and \"log cabin-y\", with stuffed, painted, and carved bears all over.\n\nThe service was prompt, attentive, and very friendly. \n\nThis place is aces for breakfast!!!"

Look up? There's a stuffed bear. Look on the wall? Stuffed bear. Look toward the bathroom? Stuffed bear. Besides stuffed bears, wood carving of bears appear both in and out of the restaurant. There's even a painting of bears playing poker! It's thus living up to it's name: Black Bear Diner (even if there are some non-black bears).\n\nIt's just one of the places that seem cool and inviting from the moment you step in. The restaurant looks 1/2 Grandmother decorated and 1/2 California Grand Adventure from Disneyland. If you like your surroundings to have a bit of warmth, you'll like it.\n\nBut it's a diner and not a museum piece so how does the food taste?\n\nAwesome. That's how it tastes.\n\nI found the place by searching \"Biscuits Gravy Las Vegas\". Several people mentioned this place as having some of THE best Biscuits and Gravy available. Being a former Southern girl, I'm very familiar with Biscuits and Gravy and they didn't disappoint.\n\nNice fluffy biscuits you can break apart easily. Creamy white gravy that wasn't too runny nor like paste (as I've seen at other restaurants). Great flavor too!\n\nMy only mistake was I ordered the spicy sausage patties. Don't get me wrong! They were good and done well. They were simply too spicy for me. Now that's rare as I'm used to very spicy food. Being from a Mexican and Cajun loving background, I'm no stranger to spicy food. Yet, the were really spicy and just a tad outside my tolerance. I could eat about 1 and 1/2 patties before I had to stop.\n\nNext time, I'll get the regular patties. I can't fault them for it. They did ask if I wanted hot and spicy patties and they delivered. I'm the one that couldn't keep up. =)\n\nMy fiance had Eggs Benedict with a side of hashbrowns and fruit. Normally I see Hashbrowns that are grated into tiny slivers. Their hashbrowns were more thick which made for a better hashbrown. A nice thick outer shell with a softer (yet still well cooked) center. The fruit was fresh and didn't appear to have any signs of aging.\n\nThe service was just fine. I got my coffee filled fairly fast and the manager came by to make sure everything was alright. As a nice bonus, he was cheerful and sincere when he asked. He had that nice grandfather look when he asked instead of the deadpan question you sometimes get. \"Hello. Everything fine? (1000 yard stare) That's great... bye.\" Didn't get that there. Just a nice friendly question.\n\nOn a final note, the employees all have a smile on their face. They don't have that \"dead inside\" look, I've see at other places. Who wants to eat where the employees look miserable? I don't.\n\nSo if you're looking for an old style Mom and Pop type place (at least in feel since they do have several restaurants), give the Black Bear diner a try. It's my new favorite place."

Uhm I don't want to clean a dead bug while I'm trying to eat. I was really grossed out and I thought it was inhospitable of the hostess to make me clean it up for her while I'm eating."

So, we sit down and literally, my hand gets stuck to the table.  When we call over a server to get a rag to clean the table, we are told that \"the breakfast crew must not have cleaned the tables\" so I guess they were disgusting during all of breakfast then the lunch shift as well as who ever was there before us for dinner?? Not buying it.  I tried the chicken fried steak as everyone seems to recommend it and I will say that who ever thinks this is the best they've ever had, have you ever been any where else??  I am very sorry but the gravy was a basic mix with no flavor AT ALL other than a pound of salt.  My husband had the Tri-tip dinner, all four little pieces of it for a whopping $17, and it had absolutely been microwaved as it was HORRIBLE!  No one ever came back to see if we were ok, until the end when our server came back with the check.  We told her that this was our first and would be our last time in.  She said she was sorry and we told her it was not her fault, just who ever was cooking in the back.  Sorry folks, I am starting to wonder if anyone has taste buds in this city as cannot even believe you would recommend this place!  I am sure I will need 100 bottles of water just to wash down the salt consumed."

Located only 3.2 miles from the strip, I was very pleased to find this place. When you first walk in, the hospitality is amazing. We were greeted and seated almost immediately. Go early, the line gets long. Cindi was our waitress. Southern hospitality at its best. Coffee was strong but with great flavor. Fresh squeezed OJ!!!\nNow for the food.....\nI ordered the sausage scramble. 1 giant biscuit topped with 2 large, homemade pieces of sausage, scrambled eggs and covered in gravy. This came with a side of hash browns that was huge! The plate was filled to the max, all portions are twice as big as they should be. Come hungry, or plan to take left overs. I had trouble finishing the meal, but I made it through.\n\nWe went the next day because of the service and food. I ordered the corn beef and hash. Home made corn beef and hash, so good. Nothing canned at this diner. Again with the OJ and coffee. You won't have to eat lunch after a breakfast here.\n\nPricing was great, like going to Denny's, but with twice the food!!! You get what you pay for and then some!!!"

There were unbused tables, people lining up at the cashier register to pay their bills, and no host/hostess in sight.  I was a tad confused as to what to do, so we just waited.  Eventually, a gentleman came around and greeted us, asked us to wait for a table to be cleaned up, but then proceeded to greet the party of 4 behind us (whom he was obviously familiar with) and lead them to an open table.  I was also a tad confused to this as well.  But we eventually got seated and drinks ordered.\n\nThe menu is cutely printed on a faux newspaper, and it seemed a bit huge and overwhelming.  I didn't realize they shoved breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner all into two pages.  It was a bit much.\n\nI ordered the eggs benedict.  The food came out super quick and was perfectly warm.  I noticed right away there were bits of bacon on my potatoes, YUM! And these were real potatoes, not frozen and reheated, but real potatoes.  That's always plus.  Then I noticed there was a GENEROUS portion of hollandaise on my eggs.  It was a tad much for me, but it was good.  My eggs were wonderfully poached and the ham was tastefully salty.\n\nLike I said, we were out the door in 45 minutes, even after waiting to be seated and the cash register debacle of taking awhile to process our debit cards when we were checking out.  I wanted to give the restaurant 4 stars because of the food, but I had such high expectations from reading other Yelp reviews and the service did not deliver.  I do believe it was in part due to being so busy and they did appear short-staffed, but I was slightly disappointed."

Not the best I have ever had, but wasn't too bad either. Not overly greasy, and still had good crunch on the crust.\n\nAlso had the burger with nacho cheese and tortilla strips.  I know, disgusting.  But we were hung over and it actually tasted pretty good.  Burger was hand pressed and not overly dry, and the cheese and tortillas provided a great creamy/crunchy texture contrast."

My friend and I decided to give this place a try after a few unsuccessful attempts. Finally getting out here and looking at the menu, lunch won out. \n\nI got the tri-tip dip with a green salad. The cuts of meat are thick and generous without being jaw dislocating. With three large slices of perfectly seasoned beef, grilled onions and mushrooms, it was perfect. The vegetables were not drowned in oil and the roll was not soaked through. The tri-tip was cooked to a medium/medium-well. I normally prefer medium rare, so next time I will request it and see if they offer that option. The green salad was standard. My friend got the hobo omelet and you have to be starving to finish it. It is a gigantic monster stuffed and topped with bacon, sausage, ham, spinach, onion, and cheese. The red potato chunks are tender, not too salty, but not crispy. It comes with a bread as well. He got the biscuit. They are big, not dense and light.  Both entrees cost around nine dollars. We were shocked by how generous the portions were for the price and that it tasted good too. I could not finish the meal without getting a blackberry sundae. Even though I was full, I cannot resist the cold stuff especially if it is topped with berries. They give a large scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with warm blackberries. Instead of doing a compote, when heated, the berries release their juices to create a sauce. As the ice cream melts and melds with the fresh fruit and whipped cream, it is heaven. \n\nThis is a nice place to have a relaxing meal. The only thing that is rushed is the food. The kitchen and staff are quick to deliver without making you feel like you have to shove it down and get out."

I ordered some of the fresh squeezed orange juice and wow was it fresh. Not something I'd expect to find in Vegas but I saw them personally squeeze it and I was amazed. It was quite the compliment to the food. \nI ordered the Joe's Hobo Omelette. Stuffed with a bunch of meat along with onion and spinach. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the omelette was so tasty. I ordered the red potatoes as a side, which weren't as crispy as I liked but still very good. I would definitely recommend trying this omelette. \n\nFinally, the best part, the pancakes. The other two people I ate with ordered the pancakes and couldn't shut up about them so I had to try. One sweet delicious bite led to about 15 more. They were hands down the best pancakes I've ever had. So thick and they melted in your mouth along with the syrup that tasted like it came straight from a log cabin. The pancakes are a must try!! I'm serious!!\n\nIf you're looking for a breakfast to start your day off right stop looking and drive here immediately. You will not regret it I can promise you that. Enjoy :))"

The most recent time I went for breakfast and was much more satisfied.  \n\nI ordered the thick-cut bacon & two eggs, which comes with hash browns (or country potatoes or fruit) and a biscuit.  The eggs were perfectly done. The hash browns had a bit of a buttery taste to them, which I'm not a fan of but it's nothing that would prevent me from getting them again.  The bacon had clearly been cooked and sitting for a while, but it was thick, crispy, and quite good nonetheless.  The biscuit is a bit of an oddball.  It's massive (about the size of 2-3 McDonalds biscuits) and looks more like a roll than a biscuit.  In fact, even the taste of it is somewhere between a roll and a biscuit, with a consistency similar to cornbread.  It was also room temperature, which is a big no-no.  I'll opt for the toast next time. \n\nThe serving sizes were more than enough.  2 eggs felt like 3.  The potatoes were double the amount you would get at any other restaurant, the bacon slices were not only thicker than I've had at most places but very long, and the biscuit, as mentioned above, was huge.  For $7 it's quite a good deal.  They have even larger meals, some which come with three eggs and two biscuits for around $10.  Breakfast is served all day, by the way.\n\nMy server was attentive and service was actually too fast.  What I mean is instead of waiting 2 minutes for my food, I'd rather wait 5 if it meant I'd get fresh bacon and a warm biscuit.  Still, the amount of food you get for what you pay can't really be beat.  I think the owner or manager even made rounds saying hello to all the customers.  A nice touch.  On the strength of how good the breakfast and service was I'm likely to go back in the near future and sample some of their lunch/dinner fare again."

They serve up traditional diner food with generous portions. Prices are about the same as any other diner I've been to in town and are pretty reasonable for the amount of food you're getting. The service was decent despite the amount of people that were dining and there was constantly a line waiting to be seated. I would come again, but either earlier or later in the day to avoid the noon lunch rush"

My husband and I jumped in the car to visit the Black Bear Diner.\n\nThis restaurant is like the Black Bear version of Cracker Barrel.  The ambiance is filled with stuffed bears all along the top of the walls and a big bear totem-like structure in the middle of the restaurant. There is a gift shelf stocked with tshirts, loganberry syrup, etc. if you want to buy a souvenir.  \n\nThe food is good and it is definitely a family restaurant. It's clean and the employees are very attentive.  Angela was our waitress and took her job duties very seriously.  I had my bear claw which could feed 2 people! The coffee was good but I like my coffee very strong which it wasn't. Hubby had chicken fried steak and eggs and was very happy with his breakfast.\n\nI perused the rest of the menu and if you are vegetarian you won't have a problem with breakfast items. If you are vegan well there is only a seasonal fruit plate or salad. I really wish that this restaurant offered a vegetarian /vegan burger or even a vegetable platter.\n\nThe pies and cobblers in the front case looked exquisite. \n\nThere was a mango tea advertised which made an excellent mocktail. Black bear diner doesn't serve alcohol. \n\nAll in all we will visit again."

The restaurant had tons of empty booths but she decided to seat us next to the kitchen and register. I felt there was a lack of privacy in that area, seeing as the register was directly behind my boyfriend's head. The noise from the kitchen was very distracting to our conversation, not to mention the sugar ants running around the table. I ordered a drink which they forgot to bring out. Then my waitress, Cheri?, made me feel as if she was very rushy with wanting to take our order, just for the food to take its time coming out.  Throughout the meal we had to constantly get our waitress' attention for refills, that is when we actually saw her, as she kept disappearing for long amounts of time. The food was okay but not good enough to keep me wanting to come back with that kind of service."

There was a New York steak version (10 oz) and a Rib Eye steak (more expensive).  I decided on the New York steak with over easy eggs, a biscuit, and country potatoes.  The meal itself was rich in portion size.  The chef gets the compliments for seasoning the steak perfectly and cooking it to the medium level I was asking for.  It was juicy and fantastic.  Everything else that came with the steak was also very very good.  I was so full after eating here I had to go run a few miles at the hotel gym to not feel like a sloth.

The couple beckoned upon us to dine with them since they were in town for a friend's 40th birthday. My husband's desire to eat off the Strip made our decision become Black Bear Diner this morning for a late breakfast around 11 AM.\n\nThe restaurant still retains its homey vibe with all the bears looking down upon your from the rafters. The newspaper menus are a nice touch, especially with their extensive menu items.\n\nI was tempted to order a more lunch-like item, but everyone else seemed to be going for breakfast. I didn't feel like too many eggs or pancakes so I decided upon their combo-type plate which allow you to choose from a few different options to make a specific breakfast meal for yourself for $8.99\n\nMy order included biscuits and gravy, link sausages, and eggs over easy. Black Bear provides a heaping mound of food - don't worry, you will not leave this place hungry. My biscuits and gravy were all right. The biscuits were delicious and flaky, not too dense, but not too airy either. However, the gravy was lacking. It certainly was lacking bits of sausage, which I would expect more of and it was lacking a salty-taste. Unfortunately they were a miss for me. My eggs were extremely runny. I realize I ordered them over easy, but even the white were a bit under cooked for my preference. The sausage links were tasty. \n\nThe only other thing I can comment on is apparently their homemade sausage patties contain fennel seeds, which understandably, some people do not enjoy, myself included. My husband's cousin ended up picking out quite of few of them from her patties so she could enjoy the meat without so many seeds. So - if you don't like fennel - beware!\n\nI'm going to stick with my 4-star rating, especially since service was good, the coffee was good, and because the bit of pancakes I ate off my husband's plate were very good as well."

Last fall I tried it for the first time. It was busy and I figured that was a good sign. Service then was alright as was the food. Nothing spectacular. I don't really remember what I even ordered. The place did leave enough of an impression on me to sign up for their email club. I get periodic offers from them though I never take advantage of these offers. Black Bear is not in my area of town. Today, however, I was in the neighborhood and feeling like lunch time was upon me. So my roommate and I stopped in. We were taken to the seating area quickly though our table was not cleared yet. We waited while they cleaned. Our drink order was taken right away and by I think three people. All very friendly. It took several minutes to look through the menu and our server had to come back a couple of times. I almost ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. I went with the tri-tip dip with potato salad. My roommate ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw. Our food took a little while to come out. No matter though, it was busy after all. Both my roommate and I thought the same thing about our side. It was kind of bland. Neither of us finished our side. My sandwich seemed very familiar. I think it was I ordered during my first visit. It was not overly memorable this time either. The au jus seemed watered down. The beef was mostly tender. The Swiss cheese was great as were the mushrooms. The onions were supposed to be sauted but they were still mosly raw. I don't like raw onion so I picked most of them off. Nevertheless, it was filling. That is a bonus. As for the service after the food arived, it was lacking. I had my empty glass of tea on the edge of the table and was walked passed by our server several times. My refill came after my meal was finished and my plate was gone. I don't think I'll be back any time soon. It has been almost a year between visits and I imagine it will be at least another year before the next. I think I would like to try their breakfast sometime. Corned beef hash is still on my radar. Only time will tell."

My friend has the opportunity to eat here for lunch with a few friends from her job and apparently enjoyed her lunch. Came over that night and told me I have to give this place a try. Well just this past weekend I was visiting in Vegas and one morning was looking for breakfast places. So I turned to Yelp  And what comes up in the search?? This place. So I decided  perfect time to try it. And I'm happy I did! Breakfast was delicious"

Everyone was very nice and it was packed on a Friday at 11am, which was a good sign. The hubby and I had the chicken fried steak and eggs and the kids (off the regular menu) had the ham and cheese omelet & the eggs Benedict. You must try the biscuit which was awesome. The next time we are in Vegas we will stop in here again- it was close enough to the freeway to be our last stop before heading home!"

More than enough food.  Good, crispy bacon, simple scrambled egg, and some pretty tasty, hearty pancakes.  All was delicious, and we both hoped they'd come take our plates quickly so we'd stop picking at them.\n\nService was good.  Coffee kept coming, food came quickly, waitress knew all the answers.

I decided to try it again on one Sunday morning. \nWhen I walked in, it was a full house! I waited about 5 min and got a table. \nI knew what I wanted,,, Omelette, Omelette, & Omelette :) \n\n*My Happy Meal of the Dayyy: \n\n1. South of the Border Omelette-seasoned ground beef OR chorizo with ortega chilies, jack cheese, avocado and homemade salsa, served with a flour tortilla. Choice of strip-cut hash browns OR red diced potatoes($8.99): I had the chorizo and the red potatoes.. \n\n2. Coffee with vanilla cream and sugar: It was bold & smooth. \n\nWell, I really enjoyed my meal. The service was provided promptly by friendly waitress. The portion was HUGE that I had to take some home. There was no cut-off time for ordering breakfast here. I prefer real all day breakfast places for a late breakfast( I am pretty much a late riser on weekends). I noticed that a full service menu is offered for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I'll definitely give them another shot. Nowadays, I can't seem to find very many good hole in the wall, mom and pop owned places to have a breakfast in LV. It is definitely a chain world out here in the city! Sad, really....However, The Black Bear Diner serves up some good home cooking :) There are no strangers here at the Black Bear - only friends you haven't met yet :P"

WARNING!  THIS IS A DINER... A DINER DECORATED WITH BEARS...STUFFED BEARS EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK!  So if you are looking for a place that is super modern or Zen-Hipster whatever, then the BBD is not for you!!!\n\nSome of my faves:\nSouthern Scramble- their homemade scrumptious sausage (spiced with fennel? sage? I'm not huge on sausage but this stuff is to die for) on top of their huge biscuit with scrambled eggs and country gravy on top.  You can pick hash browns or country potatoes (pick the country potatoes!!!)\nShasta Scramble-eggs scrambled with avocado, spinach, onions, tomatoes, bell peppers & jack cheese \nMy husband thought the homemade corned beef hash & eggs were great! (The Bagel Cafe is his ruling stick and BBD's was a close 2nd in his opinion). \n\nTHE BEST HAMBURGER!!!!\nI have to say I have turned into a creature of habit (not of the stuffed bear variety) with their Burger Basket combo! I would choose their cheeseburger ANY day over In-n-Out, Create & 5 Guys!  EASY!  It comes with a huge portion of tasty fries which come out perfect every time I have been there. EVERY time and they taste even better when dipped into their Ranch dressing. For all you Ranch Dressing aficionados, BBD's Ranch is the real thing!!!!  I'm not sure what is going on in Vegas with Ranch dressing but most of the restaurants in town have bland, bottle-brand tasting weak-ass Ranch.  (My fave use to be Cheesecake Factory's Ranch which I use to buy to go and all Ranch is compared to theirs!)  For an extra charge (2.99?) you can order one of their hand-dipped shakes that comes with the extra in the old-fashioned tin cup-we tried the black berry...Once again, delicious!\n\nMy hubby has liked the T-bone, Tri-tip and the Prime Rib- he liked them all.  (He is not comparing them to any of the better steakhouses or anything but states they taste like the homemade Sunday dinner you use to get at your Grandma's).  \n\nWe also love their coffee and the service is always good!  Always! Expect a wait on weekend mornings."

I have opted for the fresh fruit before but they tend to put flavor full fruit on top of rind flavored fruit chunks. Flower (hostess?) and Marlene to me are the power duo. I have always had good , prompt and friendly service here but those two are the shining stars in my opinion. There are bear decorations all over the place and a jukebox kicking out older tunes . A very home cooked meal and small cafe feel kind of place. I was shocked to find out it was a chain since everything seemed to perfect to be a chain. The pies and shakes are the only other items I have tried (to go) and they are quiet flavorful. They are about the size of a Marie Calendars pot pie but filled with sweet tooth goodness. I only wish they would have a Peach Cobbler that wasn't flavored with splenda as I despise fake sugars.  The other cobblers (Apple, Blackberry ) were very good. They also have Banana, Chocolate and Coconut creme pies if that is more your style. The Cinnamon rolls are massive and look very tempting  but I am always so  haven't tried one yet.

Would rather see the chicken hanging half off the plate and spaghetti sauce dripping from the plate, you know rustic diner food, this dish fit on the the plate perfectly, the chicken was perfectly shaped and the spaghetti sauce kind of watery. the cheese on top of the parm looked like a picture right off a banquet tv dinner box.

I was really pleased by how well done the eggs were, and while I am not so much of a hash brown fan due to the wimpy little potato slivers that usually comprise a hash brown, these are potato CHUNKS.  They're cut as a standard hash brown, but they are huge pieces, and are excellent.\n\nThe service here was top-notch.  From the waitress, to the manager who stopped by to see how our meal was.  You know the drill: Manager stops by with the obligatory \"How is everything\" speech, and may or may not care about the answer.  The manager here was very sincere and genuine.  He clearly wanted to make sure that we were having an enjoyable time, and I was pleasantly taken aback by that.\n\nWhen we left, the manager was again there, friendly as could be, and chatted us up while we cashed out.  There was a handful of staff members by the register, and again, it was surprising how friendly everyone was.  For a first time visit, they made us feel like old friends.\n\nGranted, I've been here one time, and with my limited food experience from their menu, I don't know the full extent of how everything tastes.  But they impressed me enough to want to make this a regular spot.\n\nI really liked this place a lot, and if in need of a new and different food option, this is an top-notch choice, and worth the drive over there."

            "review": "Black Bear Diner is an icon that has stood at the corner of Jones and Tropicana for years. Contrary to what the name might imply to some people, Black Bear Diner did not start out serving bear meat. It started as an inn in Mount Shasta, California that overlooked a strawberry patch that was inhabited by both people and black bears. Approximately ninety years later Black Bear Diner seems to be a healthy business. They have several locations including this very one at the northwest corner of Tropicana Avenue and Jones Boulevard.  \n\n Black Bear Diner operates by six (6) credos. I have put each credo to the test. This review lists each credo with Yelping feedback. Please bear with me, while I grow my yelp into a growl while I give feedback on each of the six credos.\n\nCredo #1: We will make Black Bear Diner a place where you can feel comfortable and relaxed. We offer you great food and an experience reminiscent of a time when a small-town restaurant was the place to go for talk, friendship and atmosphere.\n\nA Yelper's growl: On my visits that occurred during the afternoon of June 22 and the morning of June 23, 2013; the lodge theme made me relaxed. There is nothing like a hundred stuffed bears to make me feel at ease. Black Bear Diner reminds me more of a bear themed Cracker Barrel than a small-town restaurant. The menu which mimics a newspaper and the place mats were interesting reading material. Being in the information age where friends, especially yelp friends are within the touch of a handheld device, I could say that the excellent Verizon reception contributed to making this a place for friendship.\n\nCredo #2: We are dedicated to serving freshly prepared home cooking. From scratch sausages and biscuits to our legendary Black Bear Cobbler, everyone at Black Bear Diner goes the extra mile to provide you with the best in good old fashioned family food, prepared fresh every day.\n\nA Yelper's growl: Based on the Shasta cheeseburger with fries that I ate on June 22 and the Bear's Choice Breakfast special that I ate on June 23; I thought that the food was good yet not extraordinary. I would have appreciated more cheese on the Shasta cheeseburger, warmer fries, and a choice of syrups and toppings for the pancakes.\n\nCredo #3 We deliver each meal just the way you order it.\n\nA Yelper's growl: This ought to be mentioned when the server takes your order. When I ordered the Bear's Choice Breakfast, this would have been nice if it was brought to my attention. I would of enjoyed more beacon instead of pancakes.\n\nCredo#4: We believe in value-hearty portions of good food. We buy huge platters and we fill them, so don't be afraid to take leftovers home!\n\nA Yelper's growl: The portions are huge. However, I feel that instead of filling up a lot of the plate with fries that they ought to replace some of them with the choice of potato salad or cole slaw. For the record fries are not the kind of food that tastes good warmed up. \n\n\nCredo #5: We feature healthy options because we care about our customers.\n\nA Yelper's growl: I do not go to a diner, especially named Black Bear to eat healthy. I say good for them for featuring healthy options. I would like to add that all the stuffed bears and bear memorabilia was good for my mental health. Stuffed bears have a way of reducing my stress level. \n\nCredo #6: If you have comments that bear repeating, please tell us. If you have extraordinary service, or have something to growl about, we want to hear from you. Please visit our website to let us know how we are doing.\n\nA Yelper's growl: Growling on business websites is not my style. My style is to growl on Yelp. With that in mind my growl of Black Bear Diner is 3  1/2 stars.\n\n***The Daniel. S 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge. This is review 90***"

Gave me time to look at the yelp pics and read some reviews. Chicken fried steak was mentioned in no less than 10 reviews and for just cause it's delicious!! So for a tip I would recommend getting a side of salsa for your eggs. They make it fresh and it is full of flavor!!! They also offer a biscuit, toast or English muffin for this meal.  This is critical for you to have the best meal ever!!!! GET THE BISCUIT!!! \nThis is not my 1st rodeo with biscuits but this monster is worth talking about. 1st of all it comes out towering over the rest of the plate like a cumulonibus cloud. I know what your thinking \"something that big has to be dry or crumbly hard\" well like me your wrong!! SURPRISE!!! This is biscuit meets Angel food cake.  It is a moist and super fluffy, softball sized creation.  Their European style whipped butter is one of many appropriate toppings for this beast. I had it 4 ways butter, gravy, strawberry jelly, and egg shrapnel all were glorious!!! Enjoy:-)"

The chicken fried steak was good.....until this last time. All of the sides were really good (potatoes, eggs, biscuits) but they burnt the breading on the chicken fried steak. It was dry and had a overcooked taste to it. Everyone else at the table loved their meal, and I've had their chicken fried steak before and it tasted fine. It was just a mistake on the kitchen staff, but that doesn't mean I won't come back again. \n\nService was friendly and fast - even though they were very busy. Portion sizes are big, so will will probably have left overs. They also have a huge menu. The waitress mentioned to us that the whole menu - breakfast, lunch and dinner - is served all day. Unlike their California locations that serve each group separate. She said that Vegas is the only location that does that. So there is a lot of choices. \n\nOut of all the restaurants we took my mom to in Vegas. This one was her favorite."

The place was half full and it took 20 minutes for our server to come take our order, food came out in an timely manner, but wasn't  cooked right, I asked for rare, got done-done steak. Our server kept showing her tattoos to the group next to us which I could swear, they didn't ask to see. Also, she was inappropriate with her stories of her private life. I don't mind small talk, but there is a limit.  I was also giving my toddler little bits of veggies and he had pulled the paper place mat off the table and I placed some food on the table which he smashed up on the table. So, I took a napkin and wiped up the mess, as I folded it back onto itself, the dirt that came up with the food... I was appalled. I should have talked to management, but I gathered my family and we left. i hope that they have cleaned the place by now, but I'll stick to going to the California locations they seem to be clean."

            "review": "First time going here tonight with the family. We decided to go since none of the \"usual\" choices was working out. Thankfully it was really close to where we live. \n\nThe service, at least to me, is quite good. There was some waiting to do but not horrible. For drinks: mom, lil' bro, and I ordered the OJ. Mom's bf ordered coke lol. I'm an OJ-type of girl. I even ask my grandma to buy bag-fulls of oranges just to freshly squeeze them for me in the morning. I have to say, their OJ was yummy--didn't have too much pulp but you can tell they're not store-bought. \n\nI ordered the Bear Paw Chicken-Fried Steak alongside red-skinned mashed potatoes, corn bread muffin and lots of heavenly gravy. I also ordered a side of their famous Sweet Cream pancakes (short stack).  Mom ordered the T-Bone steak with baked potato and their muffin as well. Bro ordered their Gardenstyle Veggie burger with Jack cheese and fries on the side. Mom's bf ordered the BIGFOOT Chicken-Fried Steak and eggs. He got it with hash browns, but instead of the biscuits he opted for the pancakes. \n\nMy chicken noodle soup and mom's salad came first. Soup was okay; not salty and the serving size was just right (since the main dishes were HUGE). We waited a little bit for our orders but I wasn't complaining at all, since I'd usually be getting antsy after 10-15 minutes of waiting. I got my pancakes first, slobbered butter all over and pretty much drenched them in syrup (yum!) Short stack comes with two pancakes the size of regular dinner plates at my house, my mom was surprised at how their \"short stack\" was too big of an order. The top pancake was a little burnt, so that's a bit of a downside, but the bottom one was the most perfect pancake I've ever eaten in Las Vegas. I've been searching for a good breakfast place and I think I've found it in Black Bear! As I was still waiting for my main order, I took a bite off of my brother's veggie burger. The texture of the patty told my taste buds it ain't real meat, but the taste definitely passed the test. Their fries were also pretty good, I actually ate a lot of it (sorry bro!) My mom also gave me a piece of her steak; now, I'm not much of a steak person when I'm not craving it, but that piece of meat was juicy and flavorful. My chicken-fried steak finally came, and the first bite was enough for me to rave about this place. I've had \"country-fried\" or \"chicken-fried\" steak from other places, namely casinos, and they all were too salty or too dry/hard or just plain yucky! I didn't even used a knife to cut it, and when I put it in my mouth it just melted. It was crunchy and creamy and all sorts of heavenly goodness in one bite! The side of mashed potatoes were also quite awesome, I like how they used red potatoes--best kind for mashed. The veggies tasted good too; a little greasy at times but hey, that's what diner food is all about. \n\nWe couldn't go for dessert, everyone was just too full and in food heaven by the time we were done. Gave our server $10 tip since she was attentive the whole time. Definitely going back next time I'm craving breakfast food :D"

I did need changes to the potatoes, they didn't get it exactly right, however I'm sure if I am more clear of my needs in the future, they'll do everything they can to make it right. \n\nAlso a small add, however very welcomed, is that they have flavored creamer for the coffee.

We came around 9am on Veteran's Day, it was packed but we were seated quickly.\n\nThe menus are printed on newspapers and have some articles on the adult menus and games/coloring activities on the kids menus.

I also added ham and jalapenos.  The meal included a choice of hash browns, country potatoes or fresh fruit and a housemade biscuit. I chose the country potatoes.  Everything was cooked and flavored perfectly! \n\nThe portion sizes are pretty big and the prices are very reasonable. I was very happy with my overall experience here!\n\nI will definitely be back again!"

We were seated in about 20 min for the two of us which was great because of how packed it was in there. One of the best things they offer is the fresh squeezed orange juice and fresh fluffy biscuits. Just starting off with those we knew our breakfast would be bomb. My fianc\u00e9e got the California Bacon Benedict (bacon on the side for me ) and I got the breakfast with French toast, two eggs and bacon. They were both absolutely amazing and our waitress had great customer service and was always smiling even when she was super busy. Will definitely come back here again!"

All of the waiters know us, and know our usual orders.  Quick, simple, good food at reasonable prices.  We even get tons of coupons after signing up with the Black Bear website.  We always make sure to show up early, since after 9 in the morning you can easily get caught up in a 30 minute wait for a table- and that's proof that we're not alone in having this place on our list of favorites."

The fourth had the waffle with chicken and said it was great.  The waffle was huge and had a paw print on it to go with the bear theme throughout the restaurant.  The two children ate from the kids menu and loved their dinners and their ice cream for dessert.  Smaller versions of the meals are available, and these are also large portions.  Diners are not charged an extra plate fee if they choose to share a meal.  To go boxes are readily available.  I would suggest getting a to go box and saving room for dessert.  We had the bread pudding, sugar bears lava cake, and the banana split cream pie.  All were delicious and HUGE portions that were perfect for sharing.  We discussed coming back with a large group and ordering one of every dessert just so we could taste each one.  The prices are very reasonable, the service is great, and the atmosphere is family oriented.  We will definitely be back!  It would be nice to see a Black Bear Diner open on the NW end of Las Vegas so we don't have to drive so far for fabulous food.  :)"

Chris the morning manager the day I went, was really on top of service, he got us seated right away, continually walked the floor and made sure people were taken care of and just overall assisting wherever needed.  Our waitress on the other hand could have been more involved.  She took our order and was barely around and was a little gruff when I asked about the selection of hot sauce and that whatever was on the table was all they had (which my other visits demonstrated there were still only proprietary sauces but there were a couple of choices).  Chris ended up getting a refill on my coffee and made sure we had the rest of what we needed, the only other time the waitress stopped by was to deliver the check.\n\nFor this location, I tried the California Benedict.  It was pretty good, the hollandaise worked well with the bacon and rest of the ingredients.  In future visits that will be a selection I try again.  Otherwise it was a quick in/quick out visit, but had Chris not closed the gap I would have ringed another star."

It comes with 2 biscuits which you can add sausage gravy to or I like to sometimes get 2 pancakes instead. We'll get to those later.  The chicken fried steak is a good size with country gravy on top. It also comes with eggs and potatoes. I usually get the hash browns extra crispy. These aren't The frozen hash browns. They are fresh potatoes sliced and fried into deliciousness. \n\nBack to the pancakes. It's like having dessert after breakfast. They are sweet cream pancakes and are hearty. I'm not a fan of fluffy air pancakes. I like mine dense and hearty. These hit the spot. \n\nThey do have other good food as well. Their burgers are good and the fries are really good too. Their thousand island dressing tastes homemade. \n\nService can be hit or miss. Most of the time they are all friendly though. But I still give it a 5 stars."

We wanted to go somewhere we've never been before and a place that was a local hot spot. I came across this place and (based on the reviews) it was a must.\n\nWe met up in the plaza around 9am. The place is pretty incognito on the outside. Because we live in Vegas, it just looked like another sports bar and grill to us. Don actually used to live down the street from the diner and I guess he never thought it was an awesome restaurant, judging on its low-key appearance. \n\nWe were greeted and seated right away. Based on the personal conversations and waitresses knowing the customers' names, it seemed like there were a lot of regulars. That's how you know this pace is a local gem!\n\nI ordered some coffee and Don ordered some oj. After perusing through the Black Bear Times Newspaper Menu, Don decided on the Country Fried Steak and Eggs and I opted for the 7-Grain Almond Granola Pancakes with a side of sausage links. Normally I'd get pancakes with chocolate chips or sweet toppings, but I decided on the 7-grain because the menu said that they were FAMOUS for them. \n\nOur plates came and they were pretty big. Good thing neither of us got the hungry bear breakfasts! Don's plate came with a giant biscuit that was perfectly crisp on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. It was soo delightful!  I didn't try any of his country fried steak or potatoes, but he finished the entire plate, which is a good sign!\n\nMy pancakes were delicious! I've never had anything like them. Normally when I order pancakes, I can't finish them, but this time I finished all three and the sausage links. They were perfect with the syrup and they weren't too dry or too mushy at all. The almonds gave them a very nice sweet taste and the grain/granola combo actually tasted awesome (sorry, I can't really explain!). It didn't taste as \"healthy\" as it sounds though, which was definitely a plus in my book! It probably was pretty healthy though, because I literally had to drive like a madman all the way home and run into my house just to use the bathroom. \n\nAll in all, I love this place! It's a great place for breakfast and it is definitely a local gem. I really suggest you try the 7-Grain Almond Granola Pancakes if you're a fan of pancakes, because you will love them. The orange juice is fresh squeezed, which is hard to come across these days. Their coffee is also delicious and it comes with free refills of course!"

Yogi, I think Mother Nature is kind of cranky today, but carry on and tell about your adventure to Black Bear Diner when you get back to the den.\n\nPawing my way into this place on my own, because the reason above and I also had to take my mom to a prearranged medical procedure up the street.    Actually traveling to this place for breakfast is like crossing the Yellowstone park for me, because it's not short trip from Henderson.     \n\nThere a nice cabin feel to the dining room when you walk in, and at the hostess station has  a  nice display of mini pies in a small refrigerated display case,   Those pie would be been cleaned out of the case if Boo Boo was here.   The interior is surround by hundreds of teddy bears, and a few collectible toys from a few generations before hand. \n\nWell, I sat down and looked at a menu, and that darn menu could doubled as the Yellowstone Gate newspaper, because it had a rather large selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner items.    It took a few minutes to decide what to eat, and the waitress who had five other tables was running slight attitude like Ranger Smith on a bad day.    Perhaps, I just wanted to keep her waiting a little longer, but I really couldn't decide what to eat, after all it was my first time eating here.    Well, I gave up, and asked my waitress for her advice, The Bigfoot chicken fried steak or the Grizz?    At that point, she mellowed out, and said their specialty is Chicken fried steak, and Bigfoot is the signature dishes.    Chalk one up for the chit, and put the order in doll face.\n\nUnder three minutes later, my pancakes and main dishes is served!   Wow, that was way too fast, and holy smokey bear this order was huge!   At first, I was a little confused...three minutes to make this order?   Well, I hammered the pancakes, and it was pretty good.  Not the best I ever had, but it was about 7.5 out of 10, and this was the best thing about this meal.   As for my chicken fried steak, it was pre-made, and didn't have that nice crunch when you bit into it.    The gravy was okay, but didn't have that slight sausage flavor, and I hate saying this but I had better at a few mom and pop places around town.   The egg were done right on the spot, and the hash brown was very good. \n\nThat morning, I was a rogue bear running amok, and setting a bad example for the other animals, but this review is one of them.    It wasn't a bad visit but it wasn't a great one either, the size portion Black Bear gives are enough for a family buffaloes or one huge Hawaiian bear like bruddah IZ (which I'm not), but what threw off this visit was the waitress (who might have gotten too many tables) and questionable speed of my meal.   I rather wait for a fresh batch of chicken fried steak, than to get it in three minutes.    Did Boo Boo miss out...nope, but they can decide for themselves on Yes or No when they visit Black Bear, and so should you."

A bit expensive when there are plenty of other more popular options."

I will definitely be adding the Black Bear Diner to my list of places to eat when visiting Las Vegas.  \n\nI arrived between normal mealtimes and was seated as soon as I arrived, even though the restauraunt was reasonably busy.  The server was awesome.  She was friendly, knew the menu cold, and when I asked her what she liked, wasn't shy in telling me but without being pushy or trying to be persuasive.  I really respected that about her.  (I ordered the \"Gobbler\" sandwich, one of her favorites, on sourdough bread, btw, and it fully lived-up to her recommendation.)  Oh, and the fries were so good that I ate all of them, even though I shouldn't have eaten so many (there was a mountain of hot, delicious fries on my plate, so what's a girl to do?).\n\nThe food was reasonably priced (lunch was $14 and change -plus tip- for a sandwich, lots of fries, and a bottomeless soda.  Service was some of the best I've ever had in family-style restaurant.  And there was plenty of parking.\n\nOverall, the Black Bear Diner was a good experience and I'll be back."

I gave it two stars more than it deserves because our servers were really friendly and really helpful. As far as the food goes, the only thing I enjoyed was the salad, which was fresh. We ordered the fried chicken with red skins potatoes (with brown gravy), green beans and bacon, and cream of potato and the chicken fried steak with red skin potatoes (with country gravy) and Caesar salad. The serving was huge and the fried chicken was juicy and crispy but way too salty. The brown gravy was salty as well. It seemed the only thing not salted on the plate was the green beans, which were canned. The chicken fried steak was incredibly bland. The breading and the gravy was so bland that even with some salt, it didn't help. Overall, the place was nice because their service was nice. Other than that, the food was not something I'd come back for."

He would yell out \"Welcome\" and thank everyone as they would leave.\n\nHe was truly getting it out there how happy he was about his customers. \n\nHe was also at the cash registers when the servers were too tied up.

That while became a happy return for my fianc\u00e9e and I recently where the food is still top notch!  Portions can often be big so it's best to ask the servers just how big the size of the plate of food is.  Biscuits and gravy are not just served on a small saucer, they're served on an elipse sized platter covered in gravy!  You WILL need to share some of these platters between two people!\n\nRecently I had one of the most delicious sandwiches EVER!  The Gobbler, not to be confused by the Gobbler served at Farm Basket, is sliced roast turkey, avocado, mayo, tomato, and cranberry sauce on toast.  Oh my God! Was that a tasty sandwich!  I think it was almost as good as the Bobbie from Capriotti's!  It's really like having Thanksgiving on a sandwich!\n\nReally attentive servers that always come around to bring you fresh beverages and they are quite knowledgeable with what comes with each platter so you don't get the whole \"I'll have to check the kitchen for you...\" or \"I'm not sure...I can ask for you...\"\n\nI'm looking forward to going back more and more to Black Bear Diner as it's definitely the place to go for comfort food favorites!\n\nThe only thing I wish, is that they were open 24/7.  The diner reminds me a lot of a diner my family and I used to frequent back east in Wilmington, Delaware called The Golden Castle.  The restaurant really seems perfect for 24/7 business!"

In strong first position is Baby Stacks= however, if you are in the area and there is a Black Bear Diner close by- by all means stop. I always select an omelet from the healthy side, you will not be disappointed. Made with egg whites, crisp fresh filling of bell pepper, onion, tomato. spinach, what ever you desire. Fresh warm toast, pancakes, awesome crispy hot potatoes, ( I always have the home fries), delicious coffee, and they even include a lil fruit bowl. Yummy, fresh and friendly, my kind of place! Have never had anything but breakfast here so I cannot comment on other menu items, but have heard the pot roast is mouthwatering. Note: There will most often be a wait because this is one hot spot to eat- I try to keep in mind that the wait isn't the fault of the management- it is the folks who are enjoying those great dishes= soon my table will come, and I will side into my seat, place my order and slowly devour every succulent morsel.... yes you will wait, but it is worth it... so very worth it."

We were looking for a nice family restaurant to eat at, and this place is literally exactly what we wanted. You get a lot of food for a pretty decent price. I really liked the theme of the restaurant and the cute little stuffed animals that lined the walls. Also for all Pokemon players- this place has a gym, so that's always a plus. If we lived in Vegas we would definitely be coming here every Saturday morning for our family breakfast."

            "review": "Warning! If you suffer from Ursaphobia(fear of the bear) do not visit this restaurant. This is one of those themed based restaurants which gives reverence to the \"Black Bear\". They have bear carvings, 100s of stuffed bears, bear hot sauces, etc. I visit this restaurant often because they serve generous portions of freshly made food. I typically go here for breakfast, I have ventured out into the lunch portion of the menu only twice so my review is basically for breakfast. If you are tired of the other restaurants trying to sell you their orange juice as \"fresh squeezed \" then try this place. I hate when I restaurant tries to pass off orange juice from jugs delivered to their location as being freshly squeezed. That's just false advertisement. Black Bear has freshly squeezed orange juice which is made on the premises. The machine can be seen in the left corner as you walk in to the restaurant. \nI usually get the freshly made corned beef hash, hash browns and a biscuit with gravy. This place not only makes the corned beef hash fresh but also the hash browns are also freshly shredded . One of the few places in town that I'm aware of that makes their own hash browns. I have also tried the Joe's Hobo omelette a couple of times. \nFor lunch I enjoyed the hot turkey dinner with mashed red potatoes and sauteed vegetables. The turkey is nicely sliced white meat with ample portions. I've never left this place hungry. \nThe one day I would stay away from here is on Sunday. The regular manager was not here on a Sunday I dropped by here recently. I must say, the place was not very well run on his day off. The manager that day definitely seemed confused and overwhelmed. The other recommendation I would make is to try to stay in the main dining room. The only times I have had slow service was when I have been seated in the side room."

Also, they literally have the best BLT in town for the price, if you get the \"BLAST\" it is a sin to not also have a side of their ranch with bacon. Yes, sometimes whoever the chef is that day puts out food that's a little sloppy. Once I was a little freaked out because they gave me my breakfast with a side of dried out/rotten orange slices (but it was the \"garnish\" stuff on the side I never eat anyway). But the thing is, if you just point out what's wrong with your food, they are happy to fix it immediately. So if you want a bowl of chicken noodle soup, some chicken strips, or a BLT, this is your place. By no means should you come here with any higher expectations. There are stuffed bears lining the entire diner, honestly what sort of food are you expecting lol"

This place gets pretty packed on a Sunday afternoon but the turn over is pretty quick.  \n\nI usually come here for breakfast items, but will occasionally have a burger when I feel like it.  Food is a-ok but definitely had better breakfast at almost half the price.  The pancakes are fluffy and moist, which is a super plus.  I like their classic cheese burger too.  Everything else is pretty standard, but i must add that i haven't ventured off to their dinner items.  Portions are huge and that's not necessarily always a good thing.  A bit excessive if you ask me; if you're not too hungry sharing would be wise.\n\nService is whatever.  I'll occasionally get a really friendly waitress who's personable and sweet, and then one who's rushed and without much personality.  \n\nThis morning i had the latter.  I was craving French toast and noticed all they had were cinnamon French rolls (their take on French toast).  I asked the waitress about it and she suggested it as being really delicious.  I took her word for it and left it at that because she seemed slightly impatient.  I would not recommend this dish!!!  It was cold, dry, too sweet, and hard.  It reminded me of a failed attempt at a Cinnabon.  I took a bite, put it to the side and shared my BFs omelet.  I actually really did try eating it though. \n\nWaitress comes up, asked if we needed a box, I said no, and she asked whether I liked my dish.  I said no, she hesitated about whether she should drop my check or possibly take my uneaten meal off of it. She decided to drop the check and went on her way.  Whatever.  The food wasn't expensive, but I definitely wasted $10 because I couldn't bring myself to eat that crap dish!!\n\nAnyway, overall this place is a-ok.  \n\nWill I be back?  Yes.  Not anytime soon that's for sure.\n\nI'm definitely passing on the cinnamon french roll next time and I'll pass on that waitress too.\n\n\nI must add that their coffee is delish! =)"

It's funny, I used to live in walking distance, but I never tried to go then and a bit sad that perhaps I missed out. It was busy, but the wait was not long at all, about 5-10 minutes. We were amused and creeped out by the decor in the meantime. There are a bunch of teddybears lining a ledge around the main dining room. They somehow seem to just be looking at me, at all times. Hehehe. \n\nThe BF and I shared: \n\nChicken fried steak - I think this is one of the best ones we've had. Its really crispy and didn't sog up with the gravy. Gravy was flavorful and the combination of the too wasn't overly salty which I find many tend to be. \n\nFajita chicken omelette - this was just OK. A bit too much peppers and everything was in big chunks that it would have been better diced up in it and with cheese present. I can't remember if it's supposed to come with cheese, but it should, I wouldn't order again. The egg itself is fluffy though so they can make a solid omelette here but these toppings I wouldn't do again. \n\nYour breakfast comes with a choice of potatoes or fruit. We tried both kinds. Normally I would pick country potatoes over hashbrowns, but their hashbrowns here are slightly bigger shreds are were good. The country potatoes has peppers and onions with it and those were decent too. My only critique is I'm going to order extra crispy on both next time as the country only had one side sizzled and the hashbrowns would be better with a more crispy top to contrast the soft potatoes below.\n\nYou get a bread as well. I got one of their biscuits which is pretty good of a biscuit that I normally don't eat a lot of my bread during breakfast, but I had to eat some with honey and butter. The BF really wanted a pancake, but a short stack is too much and their prices are odd in that it's only $1 less than a full stack so it makes it kinda not worth it. Apparently, you can sub your bread for one pancake and I don't think they charge for that either. We wanted a blueberry one and that was 99cents upgrade. This pancake was really good. I love that they put a lot of blueberries inside the batter since heating up the berries brought out their sweetness and the cake itself was nicely fluffy. \n\nSidenote, I love their own bottled habanero hot sauce that is on every table. I sprinkled that onto my omelette. \n\nService was friendly and attentive despite it being busy. She took her time giving us suggestions and answering our questions. We were checked on often and got our drinks filled efficiently. We were seated quickly and we were checked out fast as well. My first time, but it seems they know what they're doing. Despite it being a chain, it didn't feel like one and all items made from scratch is a huge plus. Most \"mom and pops\" don't make their own sausages or potatoes. \n\nWe took home some treats too. Their bear claw was alright...the inside was plain sugar with strong cinnamon and not a smooth filling paste. It is better eaten warm and it's more puff pastry and not croissant like some people think it will be. It's one of those personal preference type things. Their blackberry cobbler had me confused as cobbler to me equals crumb top and crust on the bottom and this had crust all the way on the top. Once we opened it, there was only crust on top, none of the bottom just fruit filling hence the cobbler part I suppose since it's a partial crust only. It was decent with lots of blackberry in it, I just wish it was a actual mini pie because the crust was flaky. \n\nEven with a few minor hiccups/preferences, I was still pretty pleased so we will be back I'm sure. If you want big portioned all American, no frills breakfast, this probably should be on the shortlist of choices. If you are into chicken fried steak this will probably be the best you can get in the city."

It was crispy and had such a wonderful crunch and taste.

It came with \"real\" homemade mashed potatoes and white gravy, green beans seasoned with bacon and onions, salad and a corn muffin.

I went with country potatoes cooked up fresh with peppers and onions. It comes standard with a  biscuit or toast. I opted to substitute a pancake, which Candy obliged without hesitation. The pancake was so good we passed it around the table and ordered two more. They come with plenty of piping hot syrup, which is a good thing because JR drenched his pants with the first one. No need to wax this week. The over-easy eggs were cooked to perfection and the coffee was better than average.

Our late start had me concerned that there would be a long wait.  But I was happily surprised that there was only a brief wait before we got seated.  And even though it was rather busy our waitress arrived promptly, brought our drinks and took our order.  Their Easter breakfast special was an asparagus and ham omelet.  I don't see how that dish fits with Easter, but I ordered it anyway.  Being gluten intolerant I asked if I could substitute fruit for the bread offering and they were happy to oblige.  I was surprised that the fruit had strawberries and seemed to be more of an upgrade than a substitute, which was great.  The omelet was good enough, unique to my taste, but it wasn't well blended so the filling pieces separated when I cut into it. Sadly, that subtracted from the full effect of the taste combination, but that is the only complaint I have.  My wife had pancakes and bacon from the menu which she really enjoyed.  Their bear decor is unique and gives the place a friendly ambiance.  The staff was pleasant, cheerful and helpful even thought they were really hustling on what was a very busy day."

We got our drink order right away and then were given our leisure to peruse the menu.  Lots of tempting choices so she had to check back with us a few times until we were ready.  Decisions.....\n\nWe ordered the chicken fried steak, and fish and chips.  The chicken  fried steak was crispy (almost too crispy) and flavorful and loaded with gravy.  The potatoes (red skinned mashed) couldn't have been better.  It came with grilled/steamed veggies done just right.  \n\nThe fish and chips were moist and flavorful while crispy and not greasy.  The only complaint on the fish and chips was that while the portion served was big, the pieces themselves were smaller than we've had other places.  The french fries looked better than they tasted.  Not crispy enough for us.\n\nWe got pie to go.  The chocolate cream pie was a disappointment.  I don't know what they use for the chocolate filling, but it had an odd taste, almost like a cherry liquor maybe?  Anyway, didn't care for it.  For the price, would rather have gone for a Marie Callendar's and had a full pie.  \n\nWill we go back?  Yes, this place has good diner quality food.  The salads served at other tables looked pretty darn good and what looked to be chicken and biscuits at the next table is going to get us back there for sure.  Their meatloaf special and club sandwiches are on the list too.  \n\nOkay, for some real complaints.  There was a burnt on the grill smell in the air when we came in.  Maybe due to the openness of the kitchen to the dining area.  But a little unpleasant.  When we went to pick out our to go dessert and asked what was in the bear claw, the hostess was clueless.   Let us hope she was new.  One of the waitresses popped over however and helped us out.  Brown sugar and cinnamon or plain by the way."

You can't go wrong with the Eggs Benedict either. Their hollandaise is sublime. When it comes to breakfast I prefer the hash browns over the fried potatoes. Portions at this place are massive.

It was past 10:30AM and we were a bit concerned about there being a long wait. Apparently not! We were standing for about five minutes and then seated. \n\nWhile looking over the menu, I had a good look around the restaurant. I love the ambiance and all the bears everywhere. It's got a much warmer, cozier vibe than most of the breakfast places in town despite being a fairly large chain. It has the look of a locally owned restaurant and I like that.\n\nMy mom had the corned beef hash and I had the steak and eggs. My mom really enjoyed her breakfast. I got the wrong type of potato in my order and my steak was a bit overcooked; however, everything tasted really great so I was okay with it. The portions were really big and the biscuits I got with my order were still attached and looked like the size of a newborn puppy (best description I could think of). Service was friendly and as quick as it could be considering it was pretty busy. Great breakfast!"

The GF had a chef salad that could have easily served and filled up a family of four. The ingredients were fresh and had great flavor. Only. Complaint was that they didn't have regular ranch and she had to settle for their Bacon Ranch (there was none of it left to take home with her leftovers so it really wasn't a complaint with merit)\n\n The daughter had fish and chips, another huge portion good fish flavor but the fries were soggy. They might need a different routine (not leaving them hang over the frier etc to keep them crisp).\n\nI had the Ravioli it was a huge portion I took half home with me as I also had the BlackBerry Cobbler. The Cobbler was amazing definitely worth stopping in for all by itself. \n\nThe Ravioli wasn't bad but definitely not the best thing on their menu. It looked odd/out of place on the menu amongst all the country dishes and I just had to give it a try.\n\nThe Ravioli had a strong vinegar taste that I didn't care a whole lot for. The sauce outside of the vinegar was good and the pasta/meat was almost perfect.\n\nThe service was top notch quick to refill drinks. Quick to bring out extra dressing for the salads. Always with a smile and a country flare. \n\nI'm a fan and will be happy to return."

The Biscuit was light as air, and I ordered it covered in gravy (my heart will thank me later). I normally skip the hashbrowns, as most are just cooked enough to pass as edible, this order however was fantastic, most of the hashbrowns were actually brown, and crispy just the way I love them. the Chicken fried steak was so tender that I could cut it with my fork, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I tried the better half's pancakes, and bacon both were fantastic. overall I was ecstatic on our choice to venture out off the strip, and I look forward to my next visit"

My friends husband had the nut grain pancakes and I thought for a second \"what are you thinkin\" but I let him make the mistake on his own as he is the biggest breakfast guru I know.  He was very sad and disappointed but ate the whole thing even though he didnt like the tast.  The busquits and gravy was just that....a plate full of stick to your ribs gooey biscuits with white gravy.  Looked yummy but I would feel I would need something to go with that...It was huge by the way.  The corned beef hash was incredible with their homemade potatoes.  Toast a little on the dry side but all in all - I ordered the best breakfast out of all of us. ;)\n\nOn the way out they have these homemade pies-individual size.

When it showed up on the table it was watery and just tasted like italian seasoned beef. I felt like an idiot because I should have known better than to order pasta at a place like this! C'mon, Black Bear Diner is for breakfast-all-day, burgers, and excessive amounts of french fries! It was a foolish mistake on my part, so I didn't send it back. I ate the bread that came with it and picked apart a few ravioli. My sister let me have some of her yummy breakfast foods that she was sensible enough to order. We decided that when the waitress came back we'd order some blackberry pie.\n   The waitress (I wish I'd caught her name! She was really tall with light hair, probably in her 40s) came back to check on us and noticed I had barely picked at my watery ravioli.  She asked if it was okay and I think my discomfort with complaining showed on my face. I told her that I knew better than to order pasta here and that I was done with it. She murmured something placating and took it away. When she came back with our pie she let us know that she'd taken the offending ravioli off our bill and that the pie was on the house. \n   This great service turned a \"Ugh, let's forget this ever happened\" experience into a feeling that someone really cares about customer satisfaction. Good save, guys!\nNeedless to say, the pie was AMAZING. Skip the pasta and get that!"

            "review": "I really enjoyed my meal at Black Bear Diner - I just had a chicken club sandwich and fries, but I thought their prices and their portion sizes were excellent and the food was very tasty. There's nothing super special about this diner, and there doesn't need to be. It just has good food at good prices in good (and probably too large) amounts. The service was pretty prompt and on top of anything we needed. \n\nMy companion had a half sandwich and a chicken noodle soup combo. She didn't really like the soup as it had a bit of a sour flavor to it. I figure they add some kind of lemon or some veggies that add sourness but I wasn't sure why it was sour. However, her half sandwich was a good quantity and that combo was only seven dollars.\n\nI didn't have enough room to try their dessert but I think I'll be back here when I'm in the mood for some diner food.\n\nOne thing that was a minus to me was the tables at the booths are tilted, as they are attached to the wall and sagging. It's not a huge problem but it is a tad awkward and it feels a bit run down because of that, and I didn't feel comfortable leaning on the table."

Decided to try this place out and decided that I could describe it with one word - charming.\n\nFrom the cute little (and some big) bears, to the waitresses in suspenders and classic diner hospitality, Black Bear Diner easily buttered me up before I even received my meal!\n\nThe vegetarian omelet I got was chock full of saut\u00e9ed vegetables, much more than I had expected! The egg also had that standard fluffy quality. And the biscuits...They were massive! They were warm and fluffy and oh-so-delicious thanks to the fact that my date decided to get gravy on the side. On another note, the hash browns I had were my favorite to date and the corned beef hash was better than I've ever tasted.\n\nWe also got the banana cream pie, which was pretty good but not mind-blowing. It was sweet, creamy, and crispy in all the right places.\n\nThe best part? All that delicious food for a very reasonable price tag. When we left, the hosts even bid us loud and unabashed goodbyes!

They have an assortment of foods anything from your normal eggs,sausage,pancake breakfast platter, to one of their best sellers their homemade meatloaf. If you are in the mood for food to lift your spirits but not worried about calorie counting this is the restaurant for you! Great portions, good quality, and very very affordable! What more could you want?!\n       I got The Bizz; 3 eggs, 2 sweet cream pancakes, 2 sausage, 2 pieces of bacon and hash-browns. It was exactly how I imagined and the pancakes were some of the best I ever had. I have never been big on pancakes but I fell in love with these they were fluffy and being made with sweet cream gave them this hint of sweetness. The only thing that could have been better were the hash-browns. They weren't your normally shredded  potatoes they were more like flat noodles that had been cut up and fried. The outside of the hash-browns were very crispy and the inside really soggy....were not really seasoned so they left much to the imagination. I think I will choose the country potatoes instead next time.\n       My boyfriend got the country fried steak. Never been a fan of country fried anything because it is normally very very salty. This on the other hand was pretty good. My boyfriend being a country boy raised on this stuff said it was very very good. \n       Last but not least no matter how full you are you must take home or try one of their home baked goods. I have always gotten their cobblers and they have never failed me. Crust and fruit filling are always the perfect combination and the crust especially flaky and buttery. This time around I tried the strawberry cream pie with cookie crust yum yum. I think I would like their banana cream or even coconut cream pie better. But def must try! I will continue to come here time and time again. The only thing missing that would make this restaurant that much better would be grits! Please get some grits in!"

Every layer of the dish was snapping with flavor and freshness.  It came with sides of hash browns and fresh fruit, and they were both excellent too.  The only part of the meal that wasn't top notch was the coffee, which tasted the way you'd expect diner coffee to taste.  \n\nThe ambiance reminded me a bit of a mountain lodge that is a favorite of ours.  Representations of black bears are all around, from the wood carvings out front to the wallpaper.  The service was also top notch - quick and friendly.  In short, it was a most satisfying meal.

I had the Griz breakfast. Ordered it with the hash browns and got the country potatoes instead. Our waitress immediately had it corrected. However, both potatoes lacked flavor or seasoning.\nThe ham chunk was pretty salty, but then the bacon was ridiculously salty and the sausage was mushy texture, fatty and too much sage for my taste. The eggs ordered over medium were ok and more towards over easy, but that's ok. Oh, and then the pancakes. Well, I thought they were ok, but a bit sweet, but my wife thought they tasted too much like cake batter, and they kinda did, like sweet cream or cake batter ice cream. I'm sure that's the way they supposed to be, since they were sweet cream pancakes, but maybe a bit too rich. \nI'm a coffee snob and sold coffee commercially for many years, and I would just say their coffee was mediocre. For a place like this, they should have distinguishable coffee with a unique flavor note.\nIn the end, I wasn't able to choke down the sausage, bacon or too much of the ham and hash browns. Overall, just not that great as I was hoping for better."

Sometime back, I believe they substituted russet for a while which was crumbly & not as tasty as \"new or red\" potato as used now.\n\nThe Menu appears to have really shrunk and not as interesting but I generally come for the breakfast & know what I want to order.\n\nSorry I took picture of my omelette after eating half. Couldn't wait to dig in after  smelling the aroma of and seeing the Chorizo Omelette.\n\nIt would be nice if they brought back the South of the Border Omelette & dump the Scramble. \nI know at least 6 or 8 others that used to come just for that omelette, same as me."

I'm like an overgrown she-child, so this place should have been paradise for me.  Instead, I left with a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively.\n\nIt took us ten minutes to be seated.  The woman at the cash register up front wasn't the hostess (I guess), so she left to find someone to seat us.  We waited FOR-E-VER for someone to finally show us to a table.  Then, we sat for another ten minutes after deciding what we wanted to eat for someone to come take our order.  I ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup to start.  It was tepid at best and exactly the same consistency and overwhelmingly salty flavor as Campbell's Chunky soup.  For my meal, I ordered pot roast.  Over 50% of it was fat.  The sides were pretty nasty as well... a hard and cold baked potato and burned vegetables.  My fianc\u00e9's turkey dinner was so bad that he left it untouched like it was an alien life form.  \n\nThe service was the worst part.  From start to finish, the waitress was surly and rude.  It was like we were ruining her day by just being there.  I really, REALLY tried to be nice, but it seemed like she was more mean the nicer I got.  I couldn't WAIT to bolt out of there.\n\nSeriously, people.  There are better diners in this city.  Maybe I had a random bad experience, but besides the decor, there was nothing I liked about this place."

My boys immediately took a liking to all the bear decor, Black Bear Diner is truly living up to its name. \n\nThe hostess immediately greeted us and we were seated right away. The bus person came out, took our drink orders and let us know the server would be with us shortly. Meanwhile we were waiting, we had plenty of time to look over the menu, by the time our server appeared, we all knew what to order. Our server was friendly but a bit stand-offish, she wouldn't make eye contact. \n\nItems Ordered:\n\n-Tri-Tip Dip Sandwich\n-Chocolate Cream Pie\n\nOur food came out about 10 minutes after placing our order, so it came out quick! I ordered my sandwich with mushrooms and Swiss cheese. The meat was tender but it had no flavor, it was very bland. It came with a side of au jus so that made it a little bit better. They don't skimp on fries here. Everyone's plate had an abundance of fries, the seasoning they use made them taste great. Now, onto dessert, the chocolate cream pie was amazing! It was really rich and creamy, it was the best part of the meal. It came topped with a lot of whipped cream and chocolate chips, the bottom layer of the crust is chocolate. Since we came in after 11 a.m., my boys received a free sundae with their meal.\n\nOverall, I would return but next time I would try something else on the menu since I wasn't a fan of the tri-tip dip sandwich. Food is decent, service is good but our server could have been a little bit more attentive. As we were leaving, our boys were given a balloon each by the hostess, I thought that was a nice gesture for the small patrons."

This was my 2nd time dining there, and as much as I wanted to try something different, I couldn't help but order chicken fried steak.\n\nThey do a great job - it's a large portion, served with hashbrowns and eggs.  The patty is perfectly crispy and the gravy is delicious.\n\nIt's a busy place during peak breakfast hours (they are open through dinner as well).

            "review": "Ever since we found one of these while visiting our property up in Reno, this is our \"go to\" place for weekend breakfasts. Although this is a franchise business, it never feels that way. The owner/manager is always by the front till, greeting the customers and welcoming them to the establishment. The portions are large without being obnoxious and the food is usually pretty good. We only come for breakfast, so we can't comment on their other meals.\n\nThe place is usually packed on Saturday and Sunday mornings, but don't let all the people standing around waiting scare you off. They turn tables rather quickly and the wait usually isn't more than 10 to 15 minutes. If you bring kids, there are plenty of stuffed bears and other bear related items that can keep them occupied while you wait. One word of advice--if you go on Sunday, try to get there before the local church services end. It seems like that this is the place people like to come after church and the wait can be up to 45 minutes.\n\nOnce seated, the service has always been top-notch. No matter how busy the place is, the servers always seem to have a smile on their face and make you feel like you're their most important customer. We've been coming here for years and it doesn't look like they have a lot of turnover in the front of house so the workers must enjoy the atmosphere. It's usually no more than a minute or two before you have your menu and the waitress is ready to take your drink order. Their coffee is good and we'd recommend their fresh squeezed orange juice. Unless you know exactly what you want for breakfast, the drinks will be there before you're done reading through the menu.\n\nI mostly order one of their three egg omelets (the California or I'll choose my own ingredients). No problems with substitutions here. The omelets come with hash browns which have always been crispy on the outside and warm and moist on the inside. My only complaint would be that the hash browns are under seasoned, which could be good if you're on a low sodium diet. I'll include a side of their sausage links to add a bit of meat to my meal. The links have just the right amount of seasoning to have that sausage bite without being overpowering. They are large, fresh and juicy instead of the small, wrinkled ones that have been sitting under a heat lamp that you get in some of the larger chains. Their buttermilk pancakes are large and fluffy and have never been over or undercooked. If you don't think you can eat the full meal, try ordering from their \"Little Less\" menu. The omelets are made with two eggs instead of three and all the portions are a bit smaller.\n\nThe bad part about this place is that it's out west Tropicana which is a bit of a drive for us. We wish they'd open one somewhere in the northwest, although then we'd be eating here more than we probably should."

Neither one of us could eat all of it but we wanted to taste everything they offered on those two dishes. Breakfast was awesome!\nEverything was perfectly done especially the eggs which we both like over medium. The sweet cream pancakes are absolutely enormous and no way can you eat two of these at least we couldn't.  I chose the red diced cottage fries over the hashbrowns and was glad I did because they were superb! \nThis was our first visit there but we definitely will go back.  The service was outstanding and even though it was Sunday morning and every table was filled we were seated right away at a booth near the window-the only seating left.\nThe place is bright, very clean  and cheerful looking and has a great ambience.  We decided this would be our new breakfast place because there are so many more things on the menu that we're going to try.  Definitely a five star review."

It has the Denny's concept, but with a more mountain and forest kick to their personality. Less of the Denny's corporate ingenuity, and more of a homemade personal appeal. Leaning towards the Original Pancake House feel.\n\nThey're famous for the cinammon rolls and they are the size of a human's head. So please believe you can lose your fork digging in that thing. Another thing that's homemade is their buttermilk biscuits and their fresh orange juice. \n\nI tried the tri tip scramble which was meaty and delish! I'm a meat lover, and so I had to have meat as part of my five food group. The portions are huge and the scramble definitely had flavor thanks to the tri tip and the onions. \n\nIt is a mom and pop diner so if you're looking for a spot to check out some babes after a night out of town, this may not be the spot for you unless you're looking to snag a 65 year old retired cougar. RAWR. Senior Citizen Central! Also, eyes will wonder and whispers will lurk if you're looking like you had a horrible night out of town since it is also a family environment."

The location, is a good location to find this diner.  From the looks of it, it has that wilderness look and a set of wooden bears outside, which I thought it was cute, but of course that wasn't the only cute thing about it.  Walking inside, we were greeted promptly and was seated right away.  The really cute part of it, is all these stuff bears all around you.  Kind of brings back the childhood days, when I had a stuff bear.  It really put a smile on my face to think that.  \n\nWe went there, early lunch, which I had my doubts on service.  Cause usually when its the beginning of lunch, I usually assume slow service.  But it was a bit surprising that it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be and the service was prompt.  From the point we were seated to a waitress asking what we would like to drink, was just a matter of seconds.  I was very impress that they were ready and willing to take our orders.  Unfortunately I wasn't ready and needed a minute, but after I was done and put down my menu, there was our waitress, who is ready to take our order.  Well, she was talking to another customer, but really surprise that she came to our table right away, after the fact that I just put down the menu.  \n\nI was debating on the Taco Salad or New York Steak.  They both sound good and tasty, but decided to go with the New York steak and eggs.  I'm sure the Taco Salad, would of been great, but I'm glad that I went with the steak.  It was well done to my satisfaction and presented very well.  I basically ate the whole thing, and a slice of toast.  Hoping I would of went with dessert, but I was full and satisfied with the steak.  I'm sure dessert would of been great.  \n\nOver all, I was very satisfied with my visit, and recommend this to anyone who is very hungry, like  a bear.  Even though, you may not be hungry like a bear, you got to check this place out.  Sure enough, you will not be disappointed.  Especially if you love plush bears on the ceiling, that got to put a smile on your face at least."

Large and small choices and an amusing civer on the menu featuring 1962 themed fun facts and articles. How unique! That is all I had to say. Anthony's bubbly personality and charm just really impressed me. He even told me that they would be happy to offer me aome other veggie choices, not expressly on the menu. \nMy turkey, garlic mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and coleslaw even were presented very appealing and were delucious. Anthony checked on me numerous times and was just a pleasure.I asked to speak to the manager, I believe in acknowledging good employees.  Too many people are quick to point out the bad ones.While I was waiting,  I noticed a waitress walking by with a big smile. It turned out to be the supervisor, Marlene. She came by to ask me how everything was going and I told her how impressed I was with Anthony's service and attitude. She was very aware of how awesome he was. What a doll she was. Her face lit up as ahe told me how much she loved welcoming new guests and her job.  She got me a form to fill out to sign up for e-mails and offered to give me a free desert. These people know how to give great customer service. Next the manager Trinidad came by and sat down with me. He was fabulous too. He told me how he loved working for this company. He praised his staff also. He told me how they all loved to get to know their customers and hoped I would return.\nWhat a great, warm place with delicious food, good prices, great value and a real family feel to it.

If you're looking for a breakfast joint while you're in Sin City, give this place a try."

Loved the decor from the very start, the place was hardly crowded and the menus are printed on newsprint.\n\nOur waiter was super friendly, and the food was great. I had the Tri-Tip dip, the sandwich was cooked to perfection, the others at the table had the meatloaf and the chicken fried steak. All where a hit. For dessert we all split an amazing coconut cream pie.\n\nThe prices are really good, about average for what you would get anywhere else. What we ordered would probably cost twice as much, if you could even find this kind of food.\n\nThe setting was about 4 miles off the strip and offered a nice change of pace that allowed us to talk to one another and plan the rest of our night.\n\nGreat place, if in Vegas this and The Original Pancake House are a must for eating."

We were less than pleased. My eggs and potatoes tasted like canola oil and my fruit bowl was subpar at very best, clearly not fresh. My sisters sandwich had little to no avocado and white American cheese instead of pepper jack. My dad, a big omelet lover, ordered a spinach, onion, and jalape\u00f1o omelet. What a disaster that was. Firstly, they do not have jalape\u00f1os despite the fact that I could throw a jar through the front door from the grocery store in the same parking lot. Then when the omelet arrived it was nothing more than a sheet of egg folded over with the onion and spinach sloped on top. No cheese, he hadn't asked for cheese because we were all under the impression that cheese came with omelets as a pretty main component of such a dish. We won't be back to black bear, disappointing since my dad really was a fan of this place for quite sometime."

I love homemade food because it's made with passion and ingredients that really give a true flavor.  Black Bear Dinner didn't miss the memo on that.  Although there wait times are extremely long and perhaps service could be better, the food killed it.\n\nI had orange juice and I expected to be served Tropicana or Minute Maid equivalent orange juice and to my surprise it was actually fresh squeezed with REAL orange juice.

Perfectly powdered with sugar and the bacon was nice a crisp and you could taste the smoke still from the grill...YUM!  My eggs were good too, the real deal.

It's like the egg portion is fried separately and then rolled up around the ingredients.  So anyhow the omlette was good but not great.  Mr. Mom's serves up an omlette which is awesome.  The black bear fresh fruit was excellent - nearly the best I've found except for The Daily Egg which also adds kiwi to their fresh fruit so I'd slightly prefer that one.  The entire waitress staff was the most impressive I've seen at any diner - absolutely great!!!  Our server April was simply a pleasure."

She was so sweet & made me laugh the whole time. It was so good that I thought I'd come back a second time... Guess all good things come to an end. Sad story now..... \n\nDawn wasn't there & we got stuck with this \"waitress\" named Candy. Very dry/cold, checked back at every table around except ours, seemed irritated through out the experience. Keep in mind, I'm young & my boyfriend is young. But we both have worked in the restaurant industry, we know how to tip. We also know not to profile young couples assuming that they don't have the money to tip. The food took awhile to come out, about 20-25 minutes. Not the normal ticket time for Black Bear. Candy never apologized. It might have been busy, but you're a waitress. Ask for help & keep the service up. We had to GET UP & ask another waitress to get some ketchup, our table didn't have any.  She was only nice at the end when she probably sensed our frustration with the lack of service(oh, and all her other tables left). If there was another Black Bear in town, I would never stop by this one again. \n\nThe Manager or Owner was the first person to check back after we got our food... But that was still about 15 minutes after we got it. He was about the only impressive thing about the experience. He stopped by every single table. \n\nSo to end my sad story, you wonder what I tipped her right??? Well to prove her theory right, I wrote a fat zero on the tip line & a cute little note that read \"Don't profile your guests. Young couples tip well too if you serve them right.\" \n\nHope she learns her lesson. Until then, I'm calling in before I come to make sure she isn't there. Forewarning to you guys, you should do the same! \n\nHave a great day Hungry Bears :)"

It looked like a roadside diner from my younger days in New York and we decided to try it.  It was after noon but I opted for the hash and eggs breakfast.  The hash is definitely not out of a can.  The corned beef was ample and it wasn't pasty like number 10 can hash.  The eggs were cooked to order and hash browns were the wide shredded style and NOT over cooked!!  I also liked that the food wasn't over salted in some lame attempt to generate flavor out of a can.  I was able to add salt and pepper to my taste.\nOur server was great. It was crowded, not packed, and she took good care of us.  The food arrived soon after we ordered, it was hot and more than enough to fill you up.  The prices were reasonable and a lot better than the $3.50 hotel Starbucks tall coffee I had this morning\nWe had to head back to the conference, and I admired the pies on the way out.  We didn't have time for dessert however the manager boxed one for us.  We enjoyed the banana cream pie the next day waiting on the TSA line.  That started a few conversations with our fellow travelers!"

When we got there the restaurant had plenty of seats and no wait which made us very happy. 5 stars\n\nThe cup of chicken noodle I ordered was awful and tasted like it came from a can.  1 star\n\nThe chicken and waffle was misleading since it was chicken tender and waffle,  but that didn't matter because the waffle was delicious. Although the tender was dry and hard versus juicy and crispy like it should be. 3 stars\n\nChicken Biscuit and gravy presentation was a fail,  but it tasted good so that was a win.   We decided a more suitable name would be upside down chicken pot pie. 3 stars\n\nThe kids portion were enormous, that's about it.  Nothing great. 3 stars\n\nIt's a restaurant chain with ok food but it wasn't anything amazing about it when you compare it to the other big names like Dennys or IHOP. I can see us visiting this place maybe once a year...maybe.\n\nMy wife looked down when we were seated and noticed the floors were filthy.

She took the time to answer all our questions and never let my coffee cup go empty. The coffee by the way was delicious! The menu was on newspaper and there are stories also on it telling the (you are allowed to keep it) story of BBD and other stuff. Most of the food on the menu is made from scratch and it says you can customize your order any way that you like and if they can do it, they will.\n\nI ordered from their \"little less\" menu which has smaller portions. It was still enough to fill me! For $6.99 I had 1 egg, 2 pieces of bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast. The egg was cooked just the way I ordered it, the bacon had great flavor, the hash browns were too tasty and the sourdough toast was great! Something simple as breakfast is easy to mess up, but they do it right here. I also ordered a \"Bear Claw\" priced at $4.49 however I was too stuffed from breakfast to tackle that big boy! Cindi packed it to-go for me and said to just pop it in the microwave for 25-30 seconds before I'm ready to eat it. She also said the bear claws are made at each location daily! That bear claw made for one mighty fine dessert :)\n\nLunch and dinner is also served here at BBD. I have no doubt it is probably tasty, but I'm sure this will me more of a breakfast spot for me since I enjoyed that so much."

I, much like many others, look to online reviews when making the decision to visit an establishment for the first time. This has been a pretty reliable practice until now. The negative comments were few, but I definitely should have taken heed to them even though they were drowned out by the many positive reviews. I only wish that my family's experience were even the slightest bit similar to those that felt compelled to sing this restaurant's praises. Perhaps your personal experience is dependent upon the cook and wait staff on duty at the time of your visit... In any event, as a first time patron to the Black Bear Diner on Tropicana, I will never return. Upon entering the restaurant, we were seated immediately, that's where the positives end. Shortly after ordering our drinks, a very persistent fly or two buzzing around our table and our shooing them away seemed to go unnoticed by staff; this was my first opportunity to cut our loses and leave. Instead and regrettably, I ordered the Grizz breakfast, and my wife and youngest son the Spaghetti & Meatballs. In short, they were flavorless, cold and disgusting. My other son and daughter ordered the Western BBQ burger and Chicken Strips, fortunately theirs although nothing to write home about, were edible. The spaghetti and Grizz on the other hand were irritatingly horrible. The spaghetti looked and tasted as if someone poured ketchup over 4-day-old pasta and 2 day old, half-hazardly formed meatballs. Regarding the Grizz, the eggs were cold, flavorless and watery, which its still a mystery how someone can cook watery eggs; the meats were cold and salty and the hash browns were cold, undercooked and flavorless. The Pancakes were edible, until a fly landed on the plate.  I called the manager (Don) over shortly after receiving our food and he seemed utterly shocked that we were not happy with our order, stating, \"we are one of the highest rated restaurants in the city\". I found his defensive statement odd and completely detached from the fact that there were major issues with our order. He did however; eventually express his apologies and a desire to make things right by having something else prepared. Unless there was another cook to prepare it, I had no faith that it would be any different from our first order and declined. The waitress (Chrissy) came over to our table as the manager was there and asked if we needed anything. The manager mentioned to her that we were not happy with our meal and she gave us a look that made no effort to hide her irritation and walked away... That and the fact that the manager made no comment about her disrespectful actions was unbelievable and topped off what was already a horrible experience! The manager adjusted our bill; we paid and left completely feeling as if we just walked out of an episode of the twilight zone. I will never return, and to those that read this review and still take a chance with the Black Bear Diner on Tropicana, good luck"

I had to ask, and our waiter said they squeeze fresh juice from oranges every day.  What a trip.  Too bad it was like more than $3 per glass, a bit pricey but I guess you pay for freshness.  Their menus were cool too, printed on old newspaper articles.  \n\nTheir menu was big, and we had tons of choices from the breakfast and lunch menus to choose from.  I love my breakfast, so I ended up choosing their 'Volcano' breakfast...it's their most popular.  I got three HUGE pancakes (As big as the plate...I opted for the 7-grain Almond ones for a buck more), 2 scrambled eggs, 2 sausage links, and 2 thick pieces of bacon.  This plate was made for a king!  Wasn't bad for only 8 bucks and change either.  It was seriously one of the best breakfast dishes....ever.  Pancakes were moist and buttery, the links were snap fresh, the eggs were great, and the bacon was oh so yummylicious (nice thick strips).  This beats IHOP and Denny's any day.\n\nTheir burgers are humongous as well.  One of the kids had a Bob's Big Bear Burger, the Califoria Burger to be exact.  It's a 3/4 pound (big) burger and had avocado and jack cheese, as well as your standard fixin's of lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, and pickle.  It was too big to put in your mouth!  We had to cut it in fourths just to dig in.  They give you a huge portion of fries too, crisp and delicious.  With some ketchup and ranch, these are pretty killer.  \n\nI will be going to this place again when I get the craving for some great diner food.  People were nice and courteous, but also quick.  Good quality and value for the dollar.  I can't believe this place is a franchise!  Sure don't seem like it with the down home charm and the unique decor."

Big chunks of corned beef, but not too much hash, so I got the hash browns, which made up for the lack of potato. \n\nI asked the waitress for some Tabasco, and I'm glad I didn't wait for her to give it to me. I ended up finishing my meal before she came back to check up on us.\n\nEveryone was satisfied with their respective meals, but didn't rave about their choices.

Our server was friendly and promptly took our order.  Our coffee and water was never empty.\n\nI ordered up the CFS.  It was a damn fine...FINE piece of breaded meat!  The gravy was a nice compliment and not the kind that round house kicks your guts a few hours later.\n\nBBD is home to the magic pancake!  My memory escapes me on just how it was ordered.  Perhaps, it was just to sample and then again...maybe to satisfy some sort of high carb addiction.  The pancake required NO SYRUP!  NONE!  It was sweet, light and fluffy and defied my expectation of what a diner pancake should be.  \n\nIt awesome watching the plate float around the table as it allowed the others in our party an opportunity to enjoy.  The second best part of the experience was watching or fellow Black Bear explorer dump a portion of the scolding hot syrup which accompanied (unwarranted and not needed) the mystical flap jack on his lap.  Well, one side of his lap.  HIs GF must have marveled at the one half, maple Brazilian he gave himself.\n\nAs I roamed out the parking lot, high on fat, sugar, caffeine and carbs, I stopped to look at some of the photos of celebs who have eaten here, and who should I spy...Nicholas Cage wearing some funky outfit!

I have been driving past this place since I was 15 years old and it was ALWAYS busy. I felt, it was time to finally take the plunge and get in on the buzz. Boy am I sure glad we did!\n\nThe server was very polite even though she was extremely busy. She brought us coffee right away and took our order as soon as we decided. The one thing that I LOVE in my coffee is Splenda, which they(like so many other restaurants) didn't have. Not a huge deal, but i just hate sweet-and-low, and equal.. Yuckkk! Coffee was good though. Woke us right up! My son accidentally spilled his chocolate milk all over the table and our server was over at our table, super fast, with plenty of napkins to help. \n\nI ordered the \"Volcano\" which came with \"Sweet Cream Pancakes\"(Which were excellent), Sausage links(fantastic! Tasted like homemade sausage), and crispy, delicious Bacon. Good portion size, but with the food being soo good, no portion size is going to help. This is a perfect place to have breakfast and fall back into the \"simple life\". We will definitely be back soon."

When I tasted the OJ, I knew it wasn't fresh because I drink fresh squeezed OJ daily.  After asking the server over again, she finally came clean and said they only squeeze it in the morning because they \"don't have time\".  We were there at noon.  Not sure why it would take so much time to plop a couple of oranges into the machine and then press the button.  Anyway, then I ordered my breakfast meal with the meat on the side as I am vegetarian, (meat for hubby). When the meal came all my food was on top of the meat  (I had asked for on the side) that was right in the middle of the plate.  When I showed this to the server she said they had a new cook and blamed it on him. But, the server took my order and should have checked it when she picked it up. Why blame the cook, just like she has no time to get the fresh squeezed OJ that they advertise. I was very upset to say the least and we let the manager know.  He was very concerned and really wanted to make up for it and gave us half off our bill which was 35.00 for 2 people ordering breakfast.  I think the manager should find servers that know how to do their job and not harm the business that so kindly employed them."

Turns out, theres 40+ locations all over the Western U.S., including 4 in the Bay Area. WTF? Shame on me. I wish I learned about it earlier. I would have been coming here more often, checking-in as a regular, and enjoying \"bang for your buck\" meals. \n\nSpeaking of food, if you're craving a lil bit of everything for Breakfast, order \"The Grizz.\" It comes with 2 of their special pancakes, 3 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausage links, 1 piece of ham steak and hash browns. They're pretty easy-going on changing things up if you desire. So instead of the 2 bacon strips, I replaced it with 2 more sausage links and in place of hash browns, I went with potatoes. Better. Much Better. \n\nI couldn't believe how big the portions were. I'm still thinking about it. The sausage links are not your average-sized links. No Jimmy Dean, you couldn't out do these sausages. And when the menu said ham steak, I didn't think it was a HUGE ham steak. Not really big but like I said, above-average, cooked just right. Also, the eggs came in 3 and not your usual 2. It helps to have one more. I was happy with the exchange of hash browns with potatoes. They weren't salty at all and they also threw in some chopped veggies. Good contrast in taste and made me wanna finish. I saved the pancakes for last. I didn't really see what was so special about them but just thought they were alright. If by special they meant size, then yes, they win there. Large pancakes for an already large meal. Overall, very complete meal, like it was meant for two.\n\nOur waitress took our orders WITHOUT a pen and paper; she checked-in on us; AAAND she returned my friend's pair of very expensive sunglasses he had left on the table. Say it with me: WOW. I don't t remember the last time I received service like that but it deserves 5 stars on its own. Besides that, breakfast seems best served here. Diner joints like Denny's don't compare. They make Grand Slams look like a joke. \n\nThe place is a little weird when you first walk in and see all the stuffed bears hung up across the walls and ceilings, as if someone has a fetish with furry animals or something. But it just feeds into the whole concept of the diner. I figured they must've won all the stuffed bears from Circus Circus, being that it's located in Vegas, but then again I haven't visited other Black Bear Diners so I wouldn't know. Anywho, I may not be in Vegas sometime soon to return here but at least now I have the pleasure of hitting up other ones closer to home. See for yourself."

Their breakfasts are huge and yummy. My husband had the corned beef hash and he loved it because it wasn't the usual greasy hash you get at a diner. I had the pancakes and they were super yummy. Definitely coming back next time we are in Vegas. The staff was happy and friendly too!!"

My husband and I have been living in the valley for some 15+ years and eat out quite a bit, but we have never had such good American home made food in this town.  EVERYTHING is made fresh and from scratch!  Awesome...awesome...awesome!  We went for the first time early this morning for breakfast and back this evening for dinner.  The RJ really needs to get over to check this place out.  It will be voted BEST in Las Vegas!"

This one is just like the others, the food is good the service is good and the atmosphere is good.\nWe had breakfast, everything came out in a timely manner, the food was hot, including the potatoes and there was plenty of food to be had. My eggs were not cooked as long as I like but, that was minor.\nWe had the Country Fried steak breakfast. We also tried a bear claw, that was very good. Plus the service was great.\nNot sure what some of the reviewers expect, this is a diner not a 5 star restaurant. As for the guy, who gave it one star because he couldn't take his free meal to go, that is a normal policy at most restaurants."

I asked him kindly why did i get skipped and he said \"i called that name a long time ago and nobody showed up.\" Mind you, me and my friend were stand right in front of the check in area the ENTIRE TIME! So i told the manager that and he insisted he called us. So me and my friend looked at each other and was like ok screw it. The manager seats us and asked for our drinks, i asked for a orange juice and quick he says \"we have none.\"\n\nI dint know if he did it in spite because i know they do sometimes but i was real disappointed with the service.

Underneath were a few good bites of hash but 80% of it was ruined.  Maybe I shouldn't have ordered hash at 4 in the afternoon? They do advertise breakfast all day but maybe the morning breakfast cooks handle it better.  HUGE disappointment.  The country potatoes were chunks of REALLY greasy potatoes sprinkled with some burnt onions.  Not caramelized or sauteed onions but actually black, incinerated, charred and inedible.  My over-medium eggs were over easy, very easy.  And the big biscuit was MICROWAVED and chewy, soggy.  Anybody who knows anything about biscuits knows not to microwave them.  \n\nI've never been to a chain restaurant that served a great breakfast so I was a little leary about the yelp reviews.  But this turned out even worse than I could have expected.  For a good breakfast in Vegas I will stick to Maple Tree Cafe on Spring Valley and The Omelet House on Charleston."

As we were leaving the restaurant, we happened to look over at a gentleman who had ordered the same thing and just received his meal. SIX pieces of steak. Count 'em, SIX! Why the difference? You tell me Black Bear. I ordered the French Dip sandwich. Nicely portioned as well but the meat was overcooked, dry and underseasoned. Now; about the wait staff. Had they just served all ok Las Vegas? It seemed so with those tired looks and inattentiveness. Will we ever go back. NOT ON YOUR LIFE. (The one extra star is for the portion sizes)."

Well.... we can see why everyone gets the CFS.  The bacon was like beef jerky.  Too chewy.  Not crispy.  The biscuit minus gravy was a bit dry.  Even butter wasn't enough to moisten it.  Gravy is the only solution.  The homemade corned beef has was meh.  It was just shredded corned beef brisket with some potatoes.  They need to grill the hash so it's has more crisp.  The hash browns are also a bit soggy.  A small amount of crisp, but not enough to want to finish the hash browns.  The sweet cream pancakes were very sweet.  Tasted like angel food cake batter was used to make the pancakes.   I didn't realize this place was a chain.  I thought it was a local mom and pop shop.  Now I realize the CFS was something special that got me to come back, but the bacon being like jerky is something that would make me not come back.   A disappointing 2 stars for the sequel to this story."

She was still amazingly friendly, patient, heartwarming, and knowledgeable. \nOh, the food is good too, the portions are generous, and the pancakes are the best in the entire state of Nevada, crispy on the inside and moist and creamy on the inside. We were also allowed to substitute items on the menu. In my ginormous breakfast I had  bacon and both types of sausage instead of the ham. One can get ham steak anywhere; but how often does one get to try in house made patty sausage ........deeeeeeelicious!\n\nIf you go try to get Ol' Butter Arm Elizabeth for your waitress the food is good, but her smile and attitude make it great!"

Kitsch in d\u00e9cor with a pervasive log cabin theme speckled by bears both stuffed and carved it was to the tunes of the Four Tops that I entered Black Bear Diner and greeted first by a host behind the small pastry case and then by my server, Ray, the morning progressed in two courses with countless cups of coffee, the carving action outside visible through the windows while I dined.  Starting sweet and progressing sweeter it was to the flavor of custard-rich, ice cream crowned bread pudding that the meal began and rife with caramel, pecans, and raisins the steamy block proved surprisingly light while a duo of fresh baked breads with whipped butter and honey proved equally well done; the $0.99 cornbread toothsome and buttery while the $2.39 biscuit was so fluffy it literally flaked apart to the tooth.  Working slowly through the trio as wood chips flew it was only after the pudding was polished off that Ray put in my order for round-two and arriving piping hot the quartered cinnamon roll dressed in eggy batter and fried golden was superb, a light drizzle of cream cheese frosting mingling with the surprise of pure maple syrup into pure decadence - the sort of dish best taken with milk or coffee...and perhaps even better, shared.  At this point taking my leave and settling the bill it was with two additional items that I exited the cozy confines of the Black Bear and saving them until hours later suffice it to say that it was with some disappointment that I found the signature bear claw's pastry poorly laminated around pasty nut filling while the requested \"Cinnamon Apple Bavarian Cream Pie\" had been substituted by a standard, albeit delicious, traditional Apple Pie with a glossy butter crust instead - next time I guess I'll just have to enjoy all three courses at the table instead."

It's at Tropicana and Jones in the Smith's shopping center. It's pretty low key so you might miss it, but look for the carved bears standing outside the door. Speaking of bears:. this place is ALL ABOUT BEARS. They have stuffed bears on the walls, carved bears, bear murals on the walls...they love them some bears. It's pretty cute, actually. I love the poker bears on the back wall - they're awesome.\n\nService is pretty good - I've had good and bad service here, so it really just depends on the server. Food comes quickly though, so that's a big plus. They're not open 24 hours, unfortunately. I think their hours run from 6AM to 9:45PM though so you have a pretty good time window to get in here and get stuffed.\n\nAs for the food - HELL TO THE YEAH. It's classic American diner fare - chicken fried steak, meatloaf, sandwiches...you name it. My first time here I had the large chicken fried steak. It covered the platter. They don't have dinner plates - they have platters. HUGE. They load them up with food, too. Come hungry. I don't like meatloaf at all - I can eat theirs. It's that good. If you order coffee they'll actually bring you flavored creamer to go with it. For the record, their blackberry cobbler is fantastic.\n\nAll in all, this is a great place to eat. The prices are low, the service is pretty good, and the food is fantastic. Eat here."

Just try to avoid popular post-church service times, or you will wait!\n\nThe is consistently good and so is the coffee. The service can be inconsistent at times, but is generally really good too. It's a clean restaurant and a fun place to go. They're great with children and their kids' plates tend to be a lot - but better than too little!\n\nIt's worth the trip from almost anywhere (except maybe the far northeast or east near Nellis). \n\nIn terms of seating, just be aware that if you get sat in the side room (off to the right when looking in the restaurant), the last booth on the left (walking toward the kitchen) is not bad, but the A/C blows right on you.\n\nEnjoy!"

That's all you need to know.   \n\nAfter viewing some YELP reviews about their chicken fried steak, this Texas born and raised girl had to make a special trek across this desert valley to test the YELP opinions about what could be \"the best chicken fried steak\" in town.  So far, this is the best chicken fried steak I have had in Las Vegas.  \n\nA rookie visitor here, I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the staff was.  For a busy Saturday morning, with more than a 45 minute wait - the staff was extra friendly and working their tails off.  \n\nUnlike some other reviews I see, the place was filled with a very diverse clientele.  Very diverse.  I saw many people from every racial and ethnic background in this place.  \n\nThe food was excellent.  They have a wonderful kids menu as well.  Our little one had her first ham and egg scramble here - and she ate all of it!  \n\nMy final thoughts?  It is worth the drive across town for the chicken fried steak - whether for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  If hungry for anything else, I would probably stick to places closer to my home.  \n\nFor Las Vegas southerners who might crave a chicken fried steak once or twice a year - this is my favorite so far.  Not exactly like my momma's - but nothing comes close to a momma's CFS."

My girlfriends and I came here after a morning workout at the suggestion of our trainer.  The place is cutely decorated with stuffed bears all through out and a couple bear statutes before you even walk inside.  What I like about Black Bear is unlike Eggworks or Cracked Egg it wasn't as crowded and seating felt more comfortable and not as tight.  The menu had your basic breakfast items.  If you are trying to eat healthy they offer Fit and Focused Scrambles for under 500 calories,   And I don't know how healthy the 7-grain granola nut cakes are but they had an interesting nutty flavor to them and I like them better then regular pancakes.  They also offer sugar free syrup.  The waitress suggested the two stack for three of us and it was plenty to split.  Portions are very generous.  Service was good!  Never had to ask for coffee or water refills and the waitress."

They offer smaller portions too, but be prepared either way. \n\nTheir sweet cream pancakes are the biggest rave! I can't argue with that. They taste like birthday cake, minus the icing. Fluffy, moist, and the right amount of sweet. The country fried steak is a must try! Hailing from the mid-west, a good fried steak is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They DO that here. They use the same technique with their hash browns. Add some Heinz 57 to them, you're in for treat.  \n\nAlthough located in a busy area and at times can be packed full of people, it's worth making the stop.

So I'm kinda annoyed at this point and hope the rest of the experience would be good to make up for it. We get sat and did get drinks fairly quickly. We ordered 2 kids meals (burger, chicken fingers, fries) and 2 Eggs Benedict (Huevos Rancheros, California Bacon Avocado). The food took a long time (35 minutes). The waitress was not very attentive. She did not check on us or let us know food was almost done. After food came out she did not ask if we needed anything like tobasco or anything. The food was fairly good. The poached eggs were cooked correctly. It was nice it came with a little bowl of fresh fruit and choice of hash browns or homestyle. The waitress did not check if the food was okay. When we were done she asked if we wanted anything else. I saw on the menu earlier the kids meals came with a sundae. So I had to remind her about it. She was like oh yeah it does. I think if I didn't know she would have pretended not to know so she wouldn't have to bring it. The fresh squeezed OJ was cheap quality and tasted like it was diluted and sugar was added. They charge $5 per glass. Skip it. Sad to say but I will not be returning to this diner as the food and decor/atmosphere was not bad.

Maybe next time, but this time, I ordered my usual diner breakfast... Eggs benedict with Hollandaise sauce on the side.  Plus, the fruit on the side was plentiful which was an absolute delight.  I actually took that to go as a snack for later on.  \nI also got the diced potatoes while hubby tried the the hashbrowns. He also got the fluffiest Buttermilk biscuit to sop up the gravy.  He raved that everything was homemade.  Note: You have to eat the biscuit before it gets cold.\nSon got the Strawberry Waffle off the kids menu.  It was big enough for adults and had lots of fresh strawberries, not the gooey artificial kind. \nI loved the diced potatoes as they were tasty,  nothing here was too salty.  \nThere were stuffed bears all lined up high on the wall to complement the Bear theme.  Also, the menus were cute in that they were newspapers with the menu items listed on the inside. \nOur food arrived timely and since we got there around 8:30 am on a Saturday, we got a table.  Around 9ish, a line started to form. \nThe clientele appears to be mainly locals, families, seniors, etc. \nWe were so satisfied that hubby and I didnt even eat lunch that day. \nWe recommended Black Bear to our cousin and her hubby, locals who had never heard of Black Bear, and they came in on Sunday.  They loved it too.  Now, we have a great alternative to the hotel buffets.  Expect to pay about $10 per person."

            "review": "My husband and I went there for the first time on a Wednesday night about 7pm and there was no waiting time. We approached the front counter and there was a girl with one elbow propped up on the counter behind her and she said hi and I said there were 2 of us. She asked if we wanted a booth or table, and I replied we would like a booth. She proceeded to take 2 folded newpapers (which, upon our own investigation, we found to be the menus on the inside) and walk towards the first booth. She didn't mention we should follow her, but I figured we should when she went to the closest booth. She somewhat tossed the menus on the table and asked what we wanted to drink and said our waitress would be there shortly. Needless to say, our first impression of the restaurant was awkward, and we almost felt like we were intruding on them. Meeting our waitress wasn't much more pleasant. I honestly don't remember her name, but I would request, if we were to visit again, to not sit in her section. Here's the thing, I'm under the impression that if you want to make good money as a service person, you should be very pleasant. Our waitress was just nice enough to warrant a tip, but she was not very friendly or cheery. My husband and I are neither one hard to please in the least and we both were unhappy with the service. Every time I said thank you for whatever she was giving us, there was absolutely NO reply. Nothing. Some sort of acknowledgement would be nice that I spoke to you.\n\nNow, on to the food. The sweet tea was great, and this is a hard thing to get an approval for from 2 southerners from Texas. My husband ordered the CFS with fries and green beans. The CFS was pretty good and the gravy was good. The fries were also good. The green beans were WAY overpowered by the onions in them. That's all you could taste, pretty much. I ordered the Mikey's chicken pot pie. It was pretty tasty, however, I wish it had been mentioned in the description of the contents that there were mushrooms in it. I don't care for mushrooms, so I dug through the pie to remove them, then enjoyed the rest of it. The crust and creaminess were great. We both started with salads, and those were good, too. My husband ordered the lava cake for dessert, and I had a few bites. It was also pretty good. \n\nAt the end of the dinner, we went to the front counter, and again, was very briefly asked, by the same girl as before, how we liked it, and we replied that it was good. She took my credit card for payment and, instead of handing it back to me at the lower part of the counter, she placed it on the top counter (almost at eye level), handed me a pen and 2 slips from my transaction, and turned and walked away. Really?!?  There was no \"Thank you\" \"Get lost\" or even a word after. Again, my husband and I just felt like an inconvenience to them. This whole experience was just awkward and we felt unwelcome for sure. I wish we had been on the other side of the restaurant where the only cheery and happy and laughing waitress was. I saw no one else that worked there smile. Not even once. Our waitress barely broke a grin, for goodness sake!\n\nOverall, I liked the food way more than the service, and that isn't saying much. There is supposed to be a new location opening in Henderson this fall. We will probably go eat breakfast at that location, but I don't think we will return to this location probably ever.\n\nIf I could have given this place a 1 1/2 stars, I would have. It's too bad since I really have been wanting to take my husband there for the sole purpose of him getting his beloved CFS (it's really hard to find a great southern style one to compare to back home in Texas). He was happy to get a pretty good one, but the experience was tainted by the unwelcome attitudes and faces we encountered. What a disappointment.  :/"

My brother ordered the chicken fried steak and found he preferred country fried steak more. Everything is good though, from the sausages to the eggs to the hash browns, to the ham. At around $8-$9 a person, we left with tax and tip for two people at $25.\n\nThe waitress was kind of short with us and in a hurry, and we didn't even come on a weekend or during breakfast. We were totally the only Asian people in the vicinity."

The worst steak I have ever had in my life (even worse than the overcooked, slightly burnt ones from my ex boyfriend). It was extremely hard to cut through, especially since it was so thin. It was mainly gristle, and no meat. It had so much fat, very bland, and dry. \n\nIt came with an assortment of mixed vegetables (broccoli, squash, zucchini, and onions) which were the best thing on the plate!\n\nTheir salad plate was warm, and the salad was literally lettuce, two dime size onions, two warm tomatoes, two cucumbers, and some carrots. There were no croutons, cheese, and their was barely any onions. They were also out of their gluten-free Honey Dijon dressing (which was aggravating).\n\nI really wanted this Diner to work out, but it didn't. \n\nFirst Impression:\n\nThe outside makes it look somewhat like a lodge. The inside is just a ridiculous, tacky assortment of fake stuffed teddy bears ( in all different sizes!).\n\nI don't know what type of look they were going for... but when I think of a lodge, I think of walls covered with dead animals, and huge stuffed bears with big teeth (not a little beanie baby....??)\n\nService:\n\nThe server was nice, and we tipped her 20% on our bill for $35.00. Food was delivered fast, since we were basically the only ones in there.\n\n\n\n..........."

So much so that we came back the next day for dinner before we left town.  The pot roast was delicious and we topped it off with their generous helping of Bread pudding for dessert.  The waitresses were very friendly and accommodating.  The meat loaf was the best I've ever had at any restaurant but not as good as the pot roast which I highly recommend.  I will certainly be back and check out their other locations throughout California."

Pretty standard diner fare, with large portions, strong coffee, and brisk service. Previous reviews are correct- the coffee is pretty strong! Not undrinkable, but it definitely packs a punch.\n\nI had the combo meal, which came with your choice of pancakes, French toast, or a waffle (I chose pancakes), eggs, and your choice of meat (I chose smoked sausage). The portions were definitely hearty! I really enjoyed the pancakes, they were filling, yet not too dense, and I intentionally only ate one, so I could have the other later. The sausage wasn't my favorite, but I couldn't figure out why. Eggs were fine and cooked to order.\n\nOur server was pleasant and made sure to come around often to top off our coffee. We ended up with an extra glass of water, strangely, but no complaints. He did seem eager to get us out of there, which I didn't understand- the restaurant was busy for a Wednesday morning, but there was no wait.\n\nAnyway, an overall fine experience at Black Bear Diner! If you're in the area and hungry, it's a good choice."

The staff was very friendly, the service was very quick and our food arrived on time. There was a big choice on the menu and the prices were reasonable. I ordered a seniors meal as I find normal portions too big. The first part of my meal arrived with lettuce, which was browned on the edges, cherry tomatoes (some were over rip and soggy) and cheese and croutons, also on a side plate was a dried. The second part of my meal arrived with mashed potatoes and gravy, ribs and bbq sauce. The potatoes were like glue- thick, not light and fluffy. The ribs were drowned in a very thick bbq sauce so I scrapped it all off but the ribs were very overcooked. I didn't like it at all. Will not return next time ((("

The FF would have been awesome had they not over salted them with season salt .. I finished the FD since i had something to wet it down with!!\nThe husband ... Who normally cleans his plate, wasn't able to finish his turkey burger, the patty was super dry and very bland, the bun fell apart on the first bite, so he tried taking it apart to finish it but just couldn't get past the dull taste of turkey, his fries were just as bad as mine...

He mentioned it was too bland and dry, she actually agreed with him and offered something else, he declined but she insisted he take a free dessert  of his choice home to make up for his yucky dinner.. We thought that was really nice of her but it's just not enough to get us to return..\nNope ! Just not going there... Sorry Black Baar but this was a one way trip .."

We were a party of two, the party of 6 that sat after us received there meal 20 minutes before us. We didn't get an explanation on to why it took so long. The manager gave us a free pie and an apology. I give this place 3 stars simple for the poor service this one time. I will return, food is great and fresh"

It might be because I went there at 5, and they weren't prepped for dinner yet?  My friend ordered the stuffed chicken and I ordered the chicken fried steak. They just ran out of soup, and since we were both in the mood for New England Clam Chowder, we opted to wait 15 minutes. They brought us coffee that we didn't order. We didn't get any of our food because we chose to wait for the soup. My friend had ordered onion rings, which we hoped they would bring early, but alas they did not. Her stuffed chicken was dry and lukewarm. My chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes were lukewarm as well. The steak was crunchy and it might have been better if it were steaming hot. The waitress ending up forgetting about the onion rings which were amazing. They were hot and crunchy and delicious! I only wish the rest of my meal was just as amazing. \n\nFor our dessert, we ordered the bread pudding and the chocolate lava cake- both a la mode. However, they premake the dessert, leave it on display, and warm it up.  The cake was kind of dry. The bread pudding was pretty yummy. \n\nWe both signed up on yelp to become a member to get a free coffee and bear claw. However, neither of us got the e-mail which isn't this store's fault, but a fault of yelp?\n\nTwo tables came in after us and we left later than them. I understand that we opted to wait for our soup. However, we spent two hours in that diner!"

We walked right in and were seated immediately. We ordered the Bear Breakfast (french toast, 2 eggs, and bacon) and the Godfather omelet. Both were some of the best breakfasts either of us have had. French toast was perfectly cooked (not eggy) with a hint of cinnamon and the omelet was stuffed full of veggies and sausage and a marinara sauce on top.  The portions were huge. We'll definitely make this our pre-15 Fwy meal every time we're in Vegas from here on out."

It reminded me of the diners I used to frequent in Upstate New York with my great-grandparents as a child. Upon entering on a busy Friday night, the three of us were quickly seated. I opted for 'The Grizz', their breakfast special which includes two pancakes, bacon, a small ham steak, two sausages, three eggs prepared to your liking, and choice of potatoes. Along with this Ron Swanson approved meal, I got a cup of their delicious house coffee to wash it all down. Everything was completely satisfactory as far as my meal went. Our waitress was on her game and all of the food items came out cooked to perfection, which is really all you can ask for in a basic meal such as this. The prices were reasonable enough and we all left with a stuffed bellies and smiles on our faces."

Someone said a \"country kitchen\" in another review and that is spot-on. Let's just say it's a country-diner w/ decent enough food. \n\nIn Depth Review: Walked in on a Saturday at 8pm and was greeted by a friendly hostess and a pie display case that sounded like the motor was on it's last leg and needed some WD-40. I asked to be sat away from that noise. They sat us in a back corner table near the kitchen, the floor underneath was covered in food debris from previous diners. Not the best first impression. I am not going to lie, I was nervous at this point. \n\nWaitress seemed friendly and took our drink orders. We each ordered the Arnold Palmer (iced tea / lemon-aid / strawberries) and they were delicious. The lady ordered the corned beef and hash breakfast and I ordered the grilled chicken and avocado club sandwich with a side of fries. Took about 15 minutes for our food to make it to the table. Side note: during this time I used the bathroom. The man's bathroom was quite the site. The toilets were disgusting. The vent system was making an awful screeching noise in the ceiling above and the light was flickering. Was the perfect creepy setting for an 80's horror flick. I was really nervous at this point and got out of there fast! \n\nThe food arrived and the portions were HUGE! They certainly feed you here. My wife loved the corned beef and hash and scarfed down a good amount. She's tiny and I was impressed. My chicken club sandwich looked great but was not up to par in the taste department. The chicken was overcooked and dry. The bacon was hard as a rock. I am certain the bacon was not cooked fresh and was cooked earlier in the day and just slapped on the sandwich to expedite the kitchen process. On a positive note, the french fries were AMAZING! \n\nSo it was a mixed bag with our first experience here. The bill was cheap and I can understand why so many senior citizens were eating here. Saves them and anyone on a fixed income money. The food was decent enough, just not over the top impressive. \n\nIn Summary: I have been missing the Greek Diners that I grew up going to in New York. The massive Lemon Meringue pies that are about a foot tall in the display cases up front. The club sandwiches, steak fries, milkshakes, fresh coffee and all day long breakfast at the counter w/ your neighbors. Was hoping that the Black Bear Diner would satisfy my diner itch, but sadly it did not."

They are great with our 3 year old, who loves the Chocolate Chip Pancakes!    I recommend the Chicken Fried Steak and almost always have a bowl of Chicken Noodle Soup.    The best part however, is the Cherry Creme Pie!    Save room or take one home."

Probably because there are hundreds of stuffed bears lining the top shelves of the walls!  I heart stuffed animals! But I digress... \n\nAnyway, I just want to say, this is one of those places where you can \"taste the love they put in their food\".  Every dish is fresh and tasty!  I don't know of any other diner-type establishments that I can say this about.  And I'm so glad I have a place like this right around the corner from me... I now have a \"diner\" that I love!\n\nThe only negative:  Since discovering this place, I have a difficult time maintaining my summer \"bikini body\".  Oh, chocolate cream pie and banana cream pie, how thoust torture me so!! *sigh*. Best/worst discoveries ever hahahha!  They even sell their own versions of hot sauces!  Try \"Mama Burn\" to add a little kick to your dishes! (I recommend it on the chicken flatbread for lunch!)\n\nPlease try this place.  You won't regret it!"

We had to wait about 15 minutes, but it was well worth the wait.  The server was great!  She was very attentive and kept the coffee coming!  We asked for extra gravy, for these amazing, fresh, fluffy and huge biscuits and she made sure we had enough!  \n\nThe second and third time we visited the diner, we had different servers, each of which forgot part of our orders, seemed uninterested and rushed to give us our checks, like they had something pressing to do.  The funny thing is that the restaurant was more than half empty on the other two occasions.  These days were on a Thursday evening and a Friday afternoon consecutively.  The worst part of these last two visits is that the biscuits were stale and hard and the gravy tasted old and had too much pepper.  Big Disappointment!  Because of the last two visits, I can only give the diner a three overall.  I'm unsure if I will even go back at this point.  Too bad because it's a really cute concept for a diner with all of the wood carved and stuffed bears everywhere and the homey feeling it portrays."

I pride myself on trying to support local business before resorting to chains but I feel it my civic duty to let the good folks that support this local establishment know that Blackbear Diner may perhaps be doing you a disservice.  I have a rating system that I only share in detail to those closest to my heart.  By such system this place is barely better than McDonald's. In terms of taste, this place easily has the edge over McDonald's.  It also has the advantage in terms of customer service, but no surprise there. \n\nBTW Support Local Business, you'll still find individuals who care about how you feel about their business.  \n\nOk, back to my review.  I ordered the Cinnamon Roll French Toast & side of Bacon.  I could just imagine those cinnamon rolls piping hot & crunchy slathered in butter, dripping with warm dark maple syrup.  What I got was room temperature,  soggy, fried cinnamon bread.  Imagine my disappointment when my little dream came crashing down into a sad, soggy reality.  I'm sure for most people the fact that these folks here are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of hospitality & service should make up for bad food.  I am here to enjoy my meal.  The staff did their job.  I certainly enjoyed the warm family type atmosphere!  Where this place fell flat for me, is the food.  So half of my experience was missing.  No matter who you are or where you are in life you know that if half of anything is missing it's incomplete.   What was an incomplete in school boys & girls? An F.  This place, as charming as it is, needs to do better.  My advice, fire the cook."

The look of the place is fun too stuffed bears fill a small shelf that trims the interior. Carved bears and cute chachki gifts for purchase. I am a firm believer that if you have a signature dish it should knock me over, or at least be something I will talk about. Black Bears trophy meal is Chicken Fried Steak (also one of my guilty pleasures). Firstly get the freakin orange slice, parsley and plastic portion cups off my plate (All these things just say Denny's,IHOP). Eggs were cooked right, Hash Browns were good, Chicken fried steak was just OK. It is panko crusted gravy was not very flavorfull and I got a lump of flour or whatever they thickened it with. For me to not finish a Chicken Fried steak is a big deal. The other diner had a Choriso,Green Chili, and Cheese Omlette. My first bite was a sinuey grissel and cheese that was spicey. Not the best Choriso I have had. The Coffee here is so weak that I didn't even finish one cup. I ordered milk when it came the plastic cup smelled like dish cleaner and was still wet? This place is driven by an older crowd and that explains the weak coffee and bland food. Not the mediocre choriso though. This is also a chain so the recipes are not changing, and from the 20 min. wait to get in why would they. This is more from the lack of enough Rock Star breakfast spots, than a salute to the quality of Black Bear itself. As of yet Hash House A Go Go and some select casino spots are still holding the top spot by a large margin.  I am gonna give them 3 stars this is driven by the ambiance and service."

However, the service was a little reminiscent of what a normally experience at a Denny's or Cocoa's, but with better food. \n\nI ordered the Shasta Scramble which came with avocados, spinach, tomato, onion, bell pepper, and Jack Cheese all served with a housemade biscuit. I can't remember the price, but I know it was under $10.\n\nThe three egg scramble was well scrambled and seasoned. I liked that they did not hold back on the avocado and vegetables, especially the spinach. The sprinkling of Jack Cheese was light, but just right, and the onions and peppers still had a slight crunchy appeal.\n\nThe potatoes were simple but effective. They were cooked well with a little browning on the outside and tender inside. They could of benefited from a little extra seasoning. The biscuit was okay. It was baked to mild density and was moist. However, it's flavor was a little bland, with its spotty areas of salt. I was glad they served the biscuit with soft whipped butter. \n\nService was okay. I felt our server was forcing a smile or perhaps she was just not a morning person. Anyways, she was friendly enough, but it just did not feel genuine. On the good side, we got served, ate good food, and had no issues, so that's all good.\n\n3.8 stars is what my gut tells me.."

This basically consisted of Black Bear biscuits covered with sausage, restaurant egg product and packaged gravy mix. I remember thinking I have the same package gravy mix in my pantry right now, hmm? If they would of added some customization to the gravy mix it would of tasted....special. The best part of my meal was the fresh squeezed orange juice. I think I could actually taste the orange zest from the rind in the juice. Maybe not but it tasted fresh. I also had coffee which was super strong. A little too strong for my liking. I had to put 3 creams and 5 packets of sugar and it was still too strong and it was only an 8 ounce cup.\n\nI had been to the Black Bear in Reno earlier this year and had exceptional customer service and a better breakfast. I had ordered a chili cheese omelet and was hoping to order the same thing with this visit. I suppose some menu items are regional or mangers choice. I will probably not be coming back to Black Bear as its far from my house."

We were pleasantly greeted at the door, and seated right away. I was surprised that it wasn't busier for a Saturday morning. \n\nDrink orders were taken and brought by the worker that greeted us by the door. The waitress took the order. I ordered the fiesta scramble minus the olives. I was glad that they allowed customization. It took about 15 minutes from ordering to when the food arrived. That was pretty good. The orders were exact, and not one trace of olives. Yay! The waitress came by about 3 minutes after the food was dropped off to see how everything was. That was the last we saw of her. Hence the one star deduction. Every time we needed drink refills, hot sauce, napkins, etc. we flagged down the friendly greeter from earlier who was more than happy to oblige. He was top notch and made our experience at Black Bear awesome. I believe his name is Chris, tall guy. \n\nAs for the fiesta scramble, it was very good. The eggs were fluffy, and the country potatoes were flavorful. I liked that they served the meal with warm tortillas. I highly recommend this dish."

My wife and I visited here the first time today for breakfast and we'd decided to share the grizz before even getting there. Upon arrival it seemed pretty busy in the parking lot and when we walked in it didn't feel comfortable. As an African couple the first thing we noticed was the patrons were all Caucasian, not an issue but we wanted to give it the benefit of doubt since the reviews were favorable. We were immediately greeted and sat at a booth where a waitress took our drink order and told us our waitress would be there in a few. Since we already knew what we wanted there was no need to look at the menu. About 7 minutes later our waitress named Candy arrives after tending to a few other tables and asked for our order in a very dry and forced tone. I didn't get a friendly or good service vibe by the tone of her voice, more of a \"you were sat here and I have to wait on you\" vibe. As a former waiter I've worked with people like her and know how the game goes. We ordered the grizz and just sat and observed how Candy treated all of her surrounding tables, she was friendly and gave casual conversation. Until she brought out our food was the next time she came to us. No type of check in like \"your food is coming soon\" \"how's everything tasting\" NOTHING!! We asked for a second syrup and she said ok 5 mins later I had to flag her down for it and it was obviously she forgot or ignored it bc she didn't apologize for not bringing it the first time. All in all we didn't feel welcome at black bear by Candy and it felt like we weren't deserving of the service she gave her other tables. Maybe because no other guest there had our skin color is the only reason I can think of. Customer service is top priority in the restaurant industry and we did not receive that at black bear. We will never return or recommend."

I cook for a living, we server burgers as well at my work, don't give me that BS. Anyways she really didn't try to fix the situation. My girlfriend didn't want us to make a scene so I left the issue alone. Later while some of us were still eating the server comes up to our table and try to start taking our plates.

My hubby's linguica and eggs was good, but again, just average in flavor and overpriced for the portion. I had a meatloaf sandwich, my personal benchmark for a decent diner. Thin sliced toasted sourdough, piles of thin sliced red onion strings, and gobs of sloppy BBQ sauce. Based on 3 different items and not one Delicious, we will not be back.

For those of you lucky enough to have Black Bear Diner as an option for food, choose it. You won't regret your decision."

I can sit here and rave about everything on their menu, their service, attentiveness, etc.  But it would take forever.\n\nFood is amazing, service is great.  Decor is definitely a trip, with Big wooden bears watching over you.  They manage to through in a bit of nostalgia as well - the placemats are copies of actual 1950s Vegas news articles.  Don't let the parking lot fool you - i've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table.  \n\nEggs are cooked perfectly.  Chicken fried steak (one of my favorites when I am there) is dead-on.  Burgers are perfect, and HUGE.  I can't say enough.\n\nAnd for those visiting, and looking for an alternative to the breakfast buffets, and all that crap.  Get in your car, and get over there.  Now."

It doesn't taste fresh, and it wasn't cooked with particular care.  The stuffed animals inside seem like huge dust collectors.  The booth had no padding, so unless you balanced very carefully, your behind was on wood struts under the seat and nothing else.  I feel bad saying this, but it didn't seem much different than Denny's, just bigger portions.  The service was nice, if not present often, and it has a homey ambiance.  It just wasn't great."

After a 5 mile morning hike to burn off some calories, we decided to finally hit the BBD for some good eats.\n\nMy hubby and I went with a bunch of pals. It was hit or miss whether the food was good.\n\nMy hubby enjoyed his ribs and fries - a very large portion size. The ribs were fall off the bone and layered with a good amount of BBQ sauce. They weren't the best ribs ever but they were good for the price. The corn muffin was not good due to the fact that it was stone cold. My hubby said that my corn muffins are better regardless... and I make mine from a box (Trader Joe's, baby), LOL!\n\nI ordered their famous 7 almond granola pancakes ($6.99) which were alright. They are a rather large size (not Hash House a Go-Go size, but big enough). The flavours  were okay but the main issue was texture. They didn't have quite the fluffiness on the inside due to the amount of granola. Nor did they have the nice crispness on the outside either.\n\nOur waitress was fine for a diner setting. She split our checks without a problem and was okay with the refills.\n\nOverall, considering the service, food and value - this place rates a 3 star review."

This was not the place that I had in mind, but I came here out of whim because I happened to pass by it. \n\nI didn't actually think that this place would be so packed, but it was. The amount of people in there kinda overwhelmed me, but surprisingly, we were seated right away. The staff was super nice and very prompt that everything from the seating to the food happened so quickly. \n\nTheir menu was your unconventional list! As in they used a newspaper-like template and texture to create some sort of morning vibe-- as though you're getting your Sunday paper and eating pancakes with a nice mug of coffee. Yeah, that kind of vibe. \n\nI got pancakes, sausages, hash browns, ham and eggs here. Everything from what I ordered except the pancakes didn't stand out for me. I didn't think of anything out of the ordinary from them, but they were good. I wanna say that their food is above average, but nothing about it gave me the \"wow factor\". \n\nEggs seemed like they were powdered eggs? Not to sure, but the texture was thick which is not the typical scrambled eggs that I make in the morning. Sausages were nice and juicy. I didn't eat the ham so I gave it to my partner which was satisfied with it. And the hash browns were evenly seasoned. Mix them up with a good ole ketchup, and your breakfast is golden. \n\nThe pancakes was what stood out for me. To this day, I crave their style of pancakes. I think this is by far the best one I've had in my lifetime. To even say that feels a bit magical. It was soft in texture with a hint of sweet with it. I've never had pancakes as deliciously sweet as that. Truly it tasted like pan-\"cake\". If you ever try this place out, try their pancakes. I'm a big fan of it!"

I've had smaller portions at dennys but for the same money I got more food because I got a main item, eggs, hashbrowns, bacon AND sausage AND pancakes AND coffee for UNDER $10\n\n\nSo on that little point, they can't compete with other places.\n\nOverall food was alright, not great, certainly not bad by any means.

When we finally got seated, it took the waitress almost 20 minutes to take our order. Before that, she had apologized profusely to let us know that they were short-staffed and that there were six other people ahead of us before she would even be able to take our order. About another 40 minutes later, we finally got our breakfast and my order was messed up. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with sausage I instead got bacon,  I didn't bother letting the waitress know because it would have probably taken another 20 minutes to get some sausage. My husband had ordered white toast and it wasn't until we got our order that we were told they ran out of white toast.  seriously who runs out of white toast for friggin breakfast time? \n\n overall id say the food was average. I couldn't really say it was fantastic because we waited so long to eat.

Waiter, Donna, came quickly also made good semi-suggestions and walked away - wasn't very helpful.  \n\nI had the Volcano which I absolutely loved the cream cakes - very large. Was expecting something unique but was just a regular breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausage and pancakes. Their bacon is think and crispy-must have! \n\nMy hubby had the California dream which of course I had to taste it was an all 5 Star choice! From the avocado slices with the eggs to the spinach mixed in the yolk sauce and red potatoes. And although the potatoes were incorrect the first time ( they brought hash-browns) those tasted awesome too and the waiter was quick to bring the red potatoes."

I asked a local where to find a good diner for breakfast off the Strip and he suggested this place. We took a city bus over and loved it at first sight. The food and service did not disappoint either. I had the chorizo scramble and relished every bite. My son said the pancakes were the best he ever had, and he's had a lot. The fresh-squeezed orange juice was tangy and sweet.  It feel so good to be out of the circus of the Strip and have some good, homey food. I wish we had a Black Bear Diner where we live!"

I am only 18 years of age and once I was alone he came up to me handing me a card with his phone number telling me to text him. He proceeded in making me uncomfortable by winking at me making me \"promise\" that I'll text him, or otherwise he'd be very sad. When I left he rubbed my shoulder and said he'd be waiting for a text from me. Made me feel extremely uncomfortable and harassed. Besides this everyone else was great and the food was delicious. This manager Don needs to recognize his boundaries and do his flirting elsewhere. Not where he runs a business especially with someone noticeably younger than him."

For reals. \nAll of the egg dishes (chicken sausage scramble, over medium and scrambled) were perfectly cooked, well seasoned and just plain delicious. \nLarge portions for nice prices. The biscuits were huge and fluffy.

Very short with us and a bit rude. We ordered our food and waited. I was hoping the food would make up for the lack of service. As we are waiting for the food, candy (server) was walking around helping all the other customers with a smile and very nice. I'm thinking, that is weird. Maybe when she gives our food to us, she will be nice now. The food comes and Candy says excuse me! and throws my plate down and does the same with my BF. Wow! WTF did we do? Whatever, by this time, I'm like let's just eat our food and leave ASAP. She made me feel so uncomfortable. She went to other tables and she was chatting and laughing and recommending items to customers. I have never felt so uncomfortable and confused in my life. \nOnto the food review:  I take a bite of my Tri tip sandwich (blazin bear sandwich) and it is cold. The bread and the tri tip was very cold. It came straight out of the refrigerator and onto my plate. The most disgusting thing I have eaten. I couldn't even finish my food. The Tri tip was hard and dry cause it was so cold. Not sure how they can serve food colder than room temperature, when what you ordered was suppose to be a hot sandwich?? I ended up eating my fries, since that was the only edible thing. My BF ordered the grizz. The bacon was cold and soggy like it was cooked hours ago. My BF complained that the pancakes tasted funny, so me loving pancakes, I told him if I can have some of his pancakes since my food wasn't edible. I took a bite of the pancake and realized it was raw. The pancake was gooey in the middle and uncooked batter. That was my last straw. I wanted to leave whenever candy came back. She gave us the bill and I payed up front and left as fast as I can."

I must say I was pleasantly surprised and would liken their food to an upscale Denny's. They are a chain and seem to be going for a friendly, down-to-earth, home-cooked American vibe. They serve everything on their menu (breakfast, lunch and dinner) all day long. That said, they were out of both chicken and the steak that comes with the Steak and Eggs when I was there. The chicken was fine because I didn't want any and they subbed my steak for a nicer more expensive steak so I was happy about that. The food and atmosphere are four stars, I am a fan!\n\nThe service is the reason for the extra star on this review. While the gentleman who got us our drinks really seemed to hate his life - which is always awkward- our server and the manager made up for it. My steak was overcooked, it was medium well or medium when I asked for medium rare. I told the waitress but also insisted that it was still a great steak and I would be happy to finish it - which I was! The steak was legit I just wanted them to know it was cooked wrong in case that is something they wanted to address in the kitchen later. Anyway the manager came over shortly after and apologized and gave us some Bear Bucks and a free dessert. I refused it at first because I hate taking anything from restaurants for free- I never want anyone to think I just wanted something for free especially when most of the time its the principle that matters. We did end up taking the Bear Bucks for our next visit but did not opt for the dessert because we were so stuffed. I was impressed at their response when I was seriously hardly making a fuss. There are some restaurants you have to flip tables at in order to make them fix their mistakes. I was happily surprised by their forwardness and I will be back!"

We looked on every corner and empty building, but not until they put the sign up did we know the spot.  It's a great corner, but a little worried about parking. It's a tight spot.\n\nWe walked in at dinner time, around 530pm and were met with a wall of smiling faces, all eagerly waiting on customers to show up. The place looked empty, about five tables seated. \n\nWe were shown to a table right away, handed a menu and asked if we'd been to a Black Bear before, 'great, the hostes said, we'll take good care of you here'. Then walked away. \n\nOur  server shows up and repeats the same message. She's a little awkward and forgets what she is suppose to do, I quickly give her my drink order and my husband did the same. She ran off to get them, leaving us feeling like we where in a foeign land. \n\nOnce she returns, we're ready to order, again a little awkward moment, she takes it and leaves. We figure it's beginners jitters.\n\nMy soup arrives, claim showder, it's hot, thick white, a few diced potatoes, and a few clams. It's creamy, has good flavor seasoned. They serve a hot corn bread roll, I quickly slather it with butter, it's melting quickly and I am eager for a bite, but it's a tad bland even with the butter. \n\nMy dinner arrives, I got the big foot chicken fried steak. Wait, it looks different, a crust that is flat, fried to a reddish brown outter shell over a thin piece of beef.  Could this be a frozen patty? Small, not what I'm used to seeing from Black Bear. Did they change their vender? It's served with twice the mashed potaoes smothered in cream gravy and green beans. \n\nThe mashed are made from scratched, they are thick, creamy and pretty good, but the green beans were a bit of a disappointment, despite bits of bacon, they lack seasoning, are bland and without flavor.\n\nMy husband orders the big foot breakfast with hash browns, scrambled eggs, a chicken fried steak and toast. It's a good plate, but he agrees, the steak is more a patty than a steak!\n\nGood service, a bit green, but should get better with experience? My dinner a bit bland but decent, will come back for breakfast at least, we've always enjoyed a hearty Black Bear breakfast!"

Even tho the meals were postponed by Black Bear (an air conditioning issue), we were happy to wait for a more opportune time. After all: we had eaten many times at the Tropicana location and were happy with the food and service. \n\nWith ticket in hand, we headed there on Wed night, 08/24/16) and were seated right off. The place was lightly populated and we discounted this as it was still early evening.\n\nWe were seated and given a couple of glasses of tea where they must have just made a batch; there was ice in it, but it was melting fast. I asked for extra ice.  The waitress was friendly enough but I was convinced her mind was elsewhere. It took quite a while and I had to ask a second time before I got the ice. The food was another story.\n\nThe waitress took our order and we were not served until 25-30 minutes later. We chalked this up to my having ordered the fried chicken. My wife ended up with the lunch-portion of meatloaf: one paltry slice. I got three pieces of WAY overcooked chicken and had to send it back. It was black-burned in a few spots and had more tanning done than George Hamilton.  It had to have been dropped into a way-too-hot grease pan as the skin was literally burned off in several spots.  Interestingly, it took a VERY short time for a new dish to arrive with about half the overcooking as the first batch. (I suspect some poor soul who was about to be served was going to get his meal later than expected.) I held my temper and dug in. The chicken that I did eat was not bad but was a bit dry. Seasoning was good and the breading light and crisp.  The baked potato was just right.\n\nThe waitress came by and asked if I wanted a to-go box for the rest of my chicken. I politely passed. She asked another question then popped the same question again! (Did I want a to-go box?) All in the span of 40 seconds.  WHAT THE ....??!!??  Yes her mind was definitely not in the game.\n\nWe took our check to the counter along with the comp ticket and was asked by the nice cashier, \"Did you enjoy your meal?\"  I told her we were bitterly disappointed. She offered to comp our meal until she realized it was free anyway. She offered some other opportunity to take home some dessert or other items, or I would I like to speak to the manager.  The gent standing 3 feet away appeared to BE that manager but he stood stone-cold-faced and didn't even twitch.\n\nAt this point, all we could do was decline. We called it a bust and left.  We'll give it one more chance--much later and after they have had a chance to get their schtick together,.  Time will tell and I will definitely post another entry when that happens. I rarely EVER give a restaurant a second chance and these folks don't really deserve one. But, I LOVE those blackberry cobblers.  We didn't want to tempt fate by taking one home that night. We'll see."

The portions are very generous, and the quality of the ingredients is very good. \n\nHowever, as the saying goes, \"You Get What You Pay For\", and in this case, they are bit pricey.\n\nOther than \"sides\", or just having something like Coffee, you can't order almost anything on the Menu, less than $10. That includes a basic breakfast, or a meal quality sandwich. \n\nThe servers are good, and aim to please. \n\nBottom line; skip Blueberry Hill and find one of these Diners. You might spend a dollar or two more on your meal, but the portions, quality, and service, are worth the extra money. Only real drawback, is they close at 10 PM, so that excludes them from late night and early morning meals. \n\nJudging by the above referenced class, the Black Bear Diner is in a class by itself."

Not a good choice.  Their menu is a bit limited.  They only offer white mashed potatoes (what's wrong with yams?) with their  dinners.  Their green beans have bacon in it!!!  I wasn't told this when I ordered ask for them.  I don't eat bacon!!So my dinner consisted of two very nice pieces of ham (tasty and not at all salty) and cornbread stuffing.  Oh, and a dinner salad.  The coffee was a real disappointment.  I've had better at AM/PM out of a machine!!  \n\nI also noticed their holiday decorations were almost non-existent.  It just wasn't festive. Made note to self NEVER TO GO TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!"

It turned out to be more than \"just a gift,\"  as we absolutely loved our visit, enjoyed the food immensely and had the pleasure of meeting most of the staff while there.   It was just TERRIFIC!   We plan on returning, as the menu items intrigued us to the point of saying, \"oh, I am going to order 'THIS' the next time.\"\n\nWe both had the meatloaf dinner at lunch time.  It was a very generous portion and it was delicious!  Meatloaf, mashed potatoes, veggies, soup or salad, then potato salad or cole slaw, and a homemade corn muffin.   One menu item was better than the other!    While eating, our server recommended the pot roast, and we did order a pot roast dinner to take home for that night.   Looking forward to eating that later today!\n\nOur server was remarkable.  His name was GARY, and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND him.  He was professional, yet very friendly.   He anticipated our every need before we could ask, i.e.  more napkins, more water, more salad dressing, etc.   GARY is presently working there on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, beginning at 6 a.m.   His hard work and pleasant demeanor should be recognized by management, as he was a superior server and a really nice guy.  :))\n\nThe Diner itself is very  appealing.  It is extraordinarily CLEAN, neat and provides a very pleasant environment.   Watch out for the yummy looking desserts in the case by the cashier's desk.  OMG, I felt as though I gained 5 lbs just by looking at it.\n\nWe highly recommend this location for their superior food and service, in addition to the cleanliness of the Diner.\n\nLooking forward to seeing the employees again.\n\nSincerely,\n Helen & Bob"

You are paying for the experience, and honestly, you can get the same amount of food at Burger King, same quality.  The manager won't harass you for leaving a review on yelp and stare at you every time you walk by the establishment.  The Burger King manager doesn't care.  Black bears manager?  Takes it personally and makes you feel sorry for having a bad experience.  Too bad.  \n\nIf you would like a place to hang out after Burger King, check out a coffee shop, go to the library, or take some yoga at RYK, right across the street.  You will spend the same amount of money (because black bear is over priced for its portions), and you will feel social:-))"

Note: fresh OJ is not a complimentary refill.\n\nOur family was provided cheerful service and kindness. Next time, I want us to sit at the traditional diner counter. I appreciate the Tomato Ketchup with no high fructose corn syrup! There is not a Family Bathroom but the large stall in the women's restroom has a baby changing table. The soap dispenser is difficult for children to reach. Watch out for hot water from the sink tap, the faucet is not automatic. The paper towel dispenser is a No Touch system."

There is counter seating (unlike Tropicana/Jones).\n\nWe were greeted promptly, acknowledged cheerfully, and seated quickly.  Orchid's concerns about her walker and personal mobility were addressed graciously.  The server, a young gent named Bernard, was personable and generally a nice guy.  He accommodated our special requests (\"please leave this off of this menu item\" ... \"please substittute this for that on this menu item\" ... even \"please make the ice cream sundae in a tall tulip glass instead of the normal bowl\"); service we have come to expect from the Black Bear, but it's not always provided with a gracious smile and a \"no problem, folks.\"\n\nThe food was standard good \"bear food;\"  since it was Friday, Orchid had the all-you-can-eat fish and chips (and didn't eat that much), and I had the parmesan sourdough cheeseburger and the bacon cheeseburger salad (and took some home).  The salad - which is pretty much chef-salad full-entree sized, seemed to be a little smaller than I am used to, but that could be a personal perception thing.  Otherwise, the same good, predictable food ... and isn't that what you want when you go someplace you've been pleased with in the past?\n\nI doubt we'll have any problems with this location while our \"original\" place gets a remodel, but I will (of course) miss our regular complement of first-name-basis staff at Tropicana/Jones.\n\nOn the Nighthawk 100-point scale:  a solid 90."

In this review I will cover the hottest day in this restaurants history, and that's a fact.  \n\nThe atmosphere was mostly a mix of beautifully designed theme furniture and cute wall and chair art that will zoom you away to the open Midwestern wilderness faster than a scoop of calgon and a click of the Ruby slippers.  But none of this could possibly have been enjoyed on the fateful day my partner and I decided to dine here because the air was thick, humid and above anything else and to my dismay in hoping to escape the torturous sweltering of the Las Vegas summer, the establishment's air had gone out.  My partner and I for some reason decided we could still \"make it werq\".  Little did we know, the food of this restaurant would leave a lot to be desired especially given the reputation painted by the employees when we made our initial queries of the dishes.\n\nWe decided to get our food to go even if our waitress was wonderful (Tara or something).  When we got home we expected warm food but it was worth it given the cool 74\u00b0 we keep our apartment, which is literally down the street.  \n\nThe bacon cheeseburger was quite a lot to look at, but tasted of day old McDonald's and lard.  There were plenty of fries, but even they were tasteless and underseasoned. The serving size is large to extra large but the flavor is lacking to non existent.  Too bad, because until I ate here I thought nothing with bacon could taste flavorless.  What a sad day.\n\nThe new York steak was dry but still seasoned appropriately which saved it from the trash cans wide hungry mouth.  since all the food was to go, my poor steak was shoved into little Styrofoam boxes.  The presentation therefore was as it should be.  Acceptable when taking into consideration the size of the serving.  I asked for Brown beef gravy and somehow I got white gravy.  But the waitress did offer a choice of 3 gravies.  Idk whose fault that would be.  The cooks?  Management? Waitress?\n\nI recommend the bear claw with almonds.  The waitress heated the pastry which made it softer.  The buttery and rich taste complemented my bitter decaffeinated coffee well and the size of the pastry is definitely something to write home about.  Truly an exciting way to start or end a meal:)\n\nI think having no air was the worst mistake in the history of restaurants and I even had to Google if Donald Trump owned this chain which has a dozen locations sprinkled in the western US(he doesnt).  If they are going for comfort food I would add more flavor.  If they are going for home style cooking, I would add more flavor.  If they want to compete with Biscuits cafe, The Egg and I, Le Belle Terre, Blue Ox, and the various lunch options in the area, they need to step up their game.  Get the order right, keep it warm or hot, and make sure it's not a humid sweltering oven inside of your establishment.  These are the basics, and I think Bob and Laurie Manley might need to go back to them.  \n\nIn conclusion the atmosphere is spot on thanks to the wood workings of Ray Schulz and the \"sweeping, colorful, bear-mottled murals\" of Steve and Gary Fitzgerald.  Tara the server is quaint and friendly and seems to take her position as a lighthearted ambassador of comestibles and libation.  The food itself is lacking.  And the AIR CONDITIONER WAS NOT WORKING:(  I might come back in a few months.  Until then I will not recommend eating here."

Upon arrival not more than 10 tables in the entire restaurant and got sat promptly. After 4 minutes of server (Tara) not even stopping by to greet us, I asked the first person who walked by (happen to be the manager) if we could get a server to offer us drinks. He took our drink order and she finally rolled up right before he delivered the drinks. We were ready to order so she took our order and for as slow as it was it took 26 minutes for our food to come out. She asked if we needed anything and we said no, but after a few bites into our meal we noticed my son didn't have all the condiments that came with his fajita dish so we waited a bit, then looked around and saw one server tending to her tables and our server nowhere to be found. I asked the other server in passing if she could get our server but instead she offered to get the missing condiments. As always server came by just a little to late. After finishing our meal I was looking around at an even slower restaurant with fewer tables and our server nowhere to be found again. Went up to the cashier, paid the bill and of course as we were leaving here came the server always a minute behind. Not sure if she was doing side work, eating, taking a break or just hiding but it's sad that every time I looked around the restaurant she was almost nowhere to be seen. I guess my problem is if you're that slow there's no excuse for poor service which is exactly what I felt I received. \nTo be honest this location is 3 minutes from my house, but I'd rather drive further to the Tropicana location for better service and food."

            "review": "This restaurant recently opened in my neck of the woods so we came to check it out. It was me, my boyfriend and my grandma. We arrived around 11:30 and there was a 5-10 minute wait. In reality our wait ended up being closer to 20 minutes because they had no open tables. They kept seating parties of 2 but didn't have anything for a party of 3. It was no big deal, we were patient. But by the time we were seated I was starving and ready to eat. \n\nOur server was a friendly dude, I don't remember his name. He introduced himself, told us the special of the day, and brought us drinks right away. We browsed the menu for a bit and then put in our order. 45 minutes later, we still had no food. I started seeing people that came in after us get their food. Our server made notice of this and went to check on our order. The kitchen has a big open window so you can see what's going on and I saw him and other employees scrambling about. I think they probably forgot our order. Now I was mad. 8 months pregnant and hungry, does not a patient diner make. Right away a manager stopped by to explain that some tickets had gotten messed up. He apologized and said he would take care of us. 5 minutes later our food came out, delivered by our server who was extremely apologetic. \n\nI ordered the sausage patty breakfast which came with two pork patty's, 2 eggs, hashbrowns and a biscuit. I thought the food was good, but nothing stand out or amazing. Obviously I didn't order anything special so it was standard breakfast fare.The biscuit was freaking huge, it was the size of my head! And I didn't like it. It's way too much bread and it was very bland. You can sub the biscuit for toast which is what I would do next time. My grandma ordered the Joe hobo omelet which had sausage, bacon, ham, cheese and spinach, and she said it was very good. She even had leftovers which is unusual for her. My boyfriend had the Bigfoot chicken fried steak, which was a hearty meal but just okay as well. After we were done eating, the general manager stopped by our table and apologized again for the mess up and told us our meal was on the house, as it should have been. \n\nI appreciated the staff for rectifying a bad situation and that has possibly swayed my opinion on this place. Not that I am in any hurry to come back, but I think I will give them another chance."

We had some gift certificates to use so we decided to check out this new location because it's very close to home. Needless to say, it's essentially the same bear motif, deep woods cabin decor as the Tropicana location but the carpet isn't worn and stained and the walls aren't lined with dusty stuffed bears.\n\nStaff is attentive, and the food and menu seem identical.  Typical diner food, but most of the time we get breakfast. Servings are large, and the kids' menu has a variety. It's not terribly different from the standard breakfast establishments around time. In fact, I wonder how this place will share customers with Biscuits Cafe just next door, although I think Black Bear has better pancakes.\n\nBlack Bear is a reliable diner. Nothing more; nothing less."

            "review": "We were really excited about trying Black Bear. They sat us in a corner \"booth\" right next to the window. No one came over to even talk to us for 15 minutes after we were seated. When a busser noticed we were sitting he came over and asked if we had questions. That began an onslaught of people (we literally had 3 different people wait on us). I, of course, ordered fried chicken. The meal has a lot of options, soup or salad, veggies or Italian style green beans, lots of carb options & a corn muffin. The waiter did not ask about any of my options past salad. I had to remind him about the other choices. I selected Italian green beans & mashed potatoes with brown gravy. Honey ordered a western burger with Parmesan chips. When I got my salad the lettuce was freshly washed, but not dried so there was a ton of water on the plate. Nothing special, just greens, shredded carrot, 2 slices of cucumber & 2 grape tomatoes. When our meals finally came my green beans, potatoes & gravy were cold, but the plate was \"hot\" according to our runner. We had to send back the food as it was completely inedible. The manager \"graciously\" took my meal off our bill (considering I didn't eat it, I guess that's gracious of him...I don't know). The reason I am giving 2 stars over 1 is that honey liked his burger. The service wasn't great, I couldn't try the food tho it looked ok (but I never got my cornbread muffin). If we come back we might try breakfast, but they may need to work out some kinks."

            "review": "It wasn't the best experience and we love Black Bear, or maybe just the one by Tropicana and Jones. We went on Monday at 2 PM, so it was a little bit over the lunch craze. The restaurant is almost empty save for a few people having a late lunch. We were seated at the booth across from the bar counter. Normally, a server would be with us even before my butt hit the chair, or the person who met us in the front would ask what beverages do we prefer, but this time it didn't happen and she told us that our server will be with shortly. After a few minutes, there was another lady server that came to us. Didn't introduce herself and promptly asked if we are ready to order. We noticed that she didn't have any pad or pen with her so I was thinking, hey she might be pretty amazing since my SO is very specific on things that he wanted on his burger. As we were telling her what we wanted, she kept on patting down herself obviously looking for something, checking her pockets and in a drone-like manner kept saying 'uhuh' when we told her our order. Now this is a red flag. \n\nIt took them 5 minutes total to give my SO his coffee, which normally they would serve us in an instant and then forgot my hot water with lemon but instead gave me a cold water with ice. While all of this is happening, another server came, he introduced himself as Bernard and said that he is our server. Now I'm confused. Why did the first server asked us for our order and not write it down and messed up the drinks, the first part of the meal, while there is actually a person who is assigned to that area? Couldn't she have said that she's only going to get our beverages while we wait for our actual server? So we needed to repeat our order for Bernard once again. After my side salad came our food came 15 full minutes late or more that that. I'm not usually an adamant ass that times everything but I am observant. Probably there are hundreds of reasons why the food was late, maybe they were still slaughtering the cow that was to be processed for the reuben that I ordered or for my SO's burger. Or when the place is packed and really busy or feeding two huge groups of some varsity team, but this was MONDAY at 2 pm. IT WAS EMPTY.\n\n What really got me disappointed were two things: First, the two ladies that sat at the counter while the whole mess with the lady server and Bernard coming to us, so yeah we've been seated for quite sometime, RECEIVED their food FIRST before we did. And as I remember, theirs were sandwiches as well. The second one was really the cherry on top. When Bernard, I believe remembered that we haven't eaten yet, or saw the anger and disappointment in our faces, he reminded the cooks of our order, and the cook answered in a clear voice that we actually heard it said: \"It already went out.\" Now, both my SO and I looked at them and started to listen. Bernard, with the discomfort on him said to the cook, \"No, they haven't received it yet.\" and just to make sure he looked over our table again and proceeded to tell the cooks what we wanted. While they're having that discussion, we are getting more angry, hungry and disappointed. And as for Bernard, he went on serving the food for the other people that sat down LATER than us. He didn't even acknowledged the mistake or even went to our table to apologize and tell us that our food will be out shortly. THERE WAS NOTHING. \n\nWhen we finally received our food, I was just thinking to myself, hey let's just eat, pay and get out. As I said, my SO is very specific on what he wanted, and this man used to work for diners and restaurants so he would know if your food is a few hours old and just heated up. He told the two servers twice, that there shouldn't be any tomato, sauces, or mayo. Lo and behold, a tomato was dangling in the sandwich. If he has allergies towards the tomato, this would be a great LAWSUIT. So lucky, lucky us. We stumbled upon the absent minded crew of this particular branch. \n\nSo after we ate, though my SO didn't eat half of his sandwich, I was waiting for someone to at least bring the check. So again, I looked over to the bar counter, where a man was talking to the cooks and saying hi to to employee who was about to clock in. I was trying to get his attention, while my SO was posting a review in YELP about them, and finally! made eye contact. But got ignored. He walked over the counter and then disappeared. Ok, now we decided to just leave and pay up front without the bill. When we told the girl by the register what happened, who else would come to the rescue but the manager who made eye contact but didn't even acknowledged that we might need something. I believe Corey was his name. My SO explained to Corey our disappointing experience and he promptly said, that he will take care of the bill. I will be more inclined to say Thank You for that if he didn't roll his eyes as if we're giving an excuse not to pay. All in all, NEVER AGAIN on this branch."

Not to mention that their comforting food is home made (from scratch) as well as all the desserts they carry.

For lunch I am in love with the tuna melt, I swear when I take a bite it's as if my mom was making me sandwiches when I was a child. For dinner the pot roast all the way they have huge portions so if you can't handle it they also have a little less section on the menu that basically serves half the size of the original dish. Have kids? Family friendly restaurant, kids get a free scoop of ice cream after 11 am. Be sure to dine :)"

It took a few minutes for our server to take our drink orders, iced tea for both of us. It must have been freshly brewed because what little ice there was melted rapidly. We asked for more ice when we finally found our server who was apparently hiding somewhere and was certainly not focused on her job. We had to wait about 40 minutes for our food to arrive and my hubby's  fried chicken was so overcooked, he had to send it back. I ordered the smaller portion meatloaf dinner, and small it was. One slice about the size of a deck of cards, a scoop of potatoes and green beans was on the plate, however it arrived with no gravy on the meatloaf or potatoes. Again couldn't find the server, but she rushed over with a side dish of gravy about 5 minutes later. All in all, a very disappointing dinner.

The chicken strips were extremely small, surprising even. But that's not the worst part: they were OLD. Clearly fried a while earlier and sat under a heat lamp. The batter is rock hard and completely falls off the chicken, exposing dry, yellow meat. The bits are so hard, it's almost impossible to eat. Thank you for giving me old food for my money. \n\nPancakes -- decent but clearly made with packaged or pre bought liquid batter because I can taste all the fake ingredients in it. \n\nBACON. Yeees, I order a side of bacon. First, the check out girl opens the container to show me and then bacon rolls out on the register counter. She gasps but clearly wished I didn't see that. I asked her to put it back in and request crispy bacon plus an extra order. This one was merely seared and it still looked... alive . I waited, literally for 18 minutes for a new batch. I asked TWICE wtf is going on and can I get this precooked bacon. Finally another girl hands me a container. I look. SAME FUCKING CONTAINER WITH SAME BACON and no additional order like I paid for. I send it back and tell her I'm standing there literally WAITING for that to be fixed and remind her of the extra order. About 6 minutes later she brings it. \n\nI will absolutely not ever order here again. Every single experience I wanted to have today was ruined and is INEDIBLE for me. \n\nYou're welcome to contact me and let me know how you would like to issue me my refund. \n\nNever. Again."

We were seated quickly, and because I've been to other locations here in town, we knew what we wanted and ordered as our drinks were arriving at the table. Our food came out pretty quickly and it tasted good.\n\nThe only problem that we had; the waitress checked on us early into our meal and then we didn't see her for quite a while. As a result our waters and coffees weren't filled as we ate.\n\nAs stated in other reviews: this location is newly opened; so they are still working out the 'new restaurant' issues. \n\nI'm certain we'll be back to this location soon."

            "review": "I rarely yelp any reviews but wanted to share my experience here. This was my first time at a black bear diner, and sadly possibly my last. \n\nI came here for dinner with my husband and 2 kids. I had ordered the chicken fried steak. After waiting about 20 mins, the waitress brought out my children's dishes while my husband and I waited for ours. We got our plates about 5 mins later. I absolutely don't mind waiting some time for my food. Because I know it's being cooked fresh. Mine was a little too fresh tho. \n\nThe chicken fried steak was so raw it was still mooing. I showed the waitress and she could see it was severely undercooked. I had pretty much lost my appetite by then for any steak and just opted for chicken fingers to go because by that time everyone else at the table was just about done eating. \n\nThe manager on duty was very accommodating with comping my plate and offering some gift cards and a free pie. Which was pretty good by the way.. and if it wasn't for that and the nice employees, I'd probably rate this place one star. But after all, it is a restaurant and I'm basing my review on the food that was given to me lol. \n\nI wish I could say I had a better experience, because I really wanted to try this place. Maybe I'll try again some other time, because i understand mistakes can happen, but I'm not sure it'll be anytime soon."
