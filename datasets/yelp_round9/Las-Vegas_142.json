            "review": "I wanted to grab a quick bite after an exhausting day at a tradeshow in the Venetian and AquaKnox was pretty much in the right place at the right time. I didn't feel like going on a mission to find authentic food outside the hotel and the place had just the right amount of people and volume for me to deal with (not too much, not too little). I took a seat at the bar and was helped by several very, very nice bartenders. It seems most bartenders in Vegas are a little on the jerky side, but this guy and girl were more along the lines of fine dining waiters than just bartenders.\n\nMy lite meal turned into a self made tasting menu of miyagi oysters, tuna tartar, and a butterleaf salad. One glass of white to start and one glass of red to finish. The oysters were awesome - served with a mignonette that made them pop. The tuna tartar had two sides to it - one was sliced and seared and the other was a true tartar. I would rather they just server a double of the tartar with some kind of eating vessel (like a fried wonton or something). The salad was pretty simple in ingredients, but it was perfect after the tuna and was presented in a beautiful blossom looking fashion. \n\nTip included - about $120. Is that expensive? For burger king, ya. For a nice seafood restaurant in Vegas, not so much. That said, I did earn my \"High Rollers\" badge after checking in here on Yelp."

            "review": "Ok, first time ever giving a 5 star review, but wow. Simply, wow.\n\nWife and I wanted to discover some new foods in Vegas, so the plan was to order things I wouldn't normally order. We also expected some over-the-top service and experiences. AquaKnox delivered on all of it, hands down. Please note, we're not really foodies, but we like great flavors and food, and we know good service...\n\nFrom the first moment walking into AquaKnox we knew we were seeing something orders of magnitude better than our dinner the night before (at Canaletto). The service was impeccable. We ordered our meal and the sommelier came by to offer her recommendations -- she offered a great wine for dinner that was really excellent. As one would expect in a great establishment, the wine was kept chilled near the table, and we were frequently checked on and our wine was never low...\n\nOur dining experience began with a really great amuse-bouche, delivered with the first pour of the wine. The single bit was a nice start!  For an appetizer, I started with the squash blossom appetizer, holding true to my \"I wouldn't normally order this, but what the hell\" approach for this trip. Wow. It was like experience the ultimate spring garden - the baby greens, pea shoots, delicately fried squash blossoms were all incredible. Perfectly dressed.  The best appetizer I have ever had.\n\nFor an entr\u00e9e, I chose the whole sea bass and a side of the corn succotash (with edamame). The fish was perfectly cooked and very tasty, and the skin was incredibly crispy.  I found myself rationing the skin to enjoy it with every bite. The succotash was over the top good -- clearly nothing I had had the privilege of enjoying growing up!\n\nFor desert, I had the pumpkin cheesecake -- clearly nothing I would normally have gotten. Clearly I would have been depriving myself. The ginger caramel and spiced orange ice cream was an amazing compliment to the rich pumpkin cheesecake.\n\nThe meal ended with another single bite of chocolate and a refreshing lemon vodka.\n\nFrom start to finish, AquaKnox single handedly delivered what we had hoped Vegas would deliver on. The service throughout was incredible and the food was always great and mind-blowing at times (wow, that appetizer). Despite my disappointing experiences elsewhere in the Vegas dining scene, I would come back to Vegas simply to enjoy AquaKnox again."

It just melted in my mouth like BUTTAH!!! It was superb that all my other friends wanted to eat more of my dish!\nHEY! Its mine.....\n\nWe also ordered fresh oysters and 2 bottles of wine that I can remember.\nAnyway, it was a wonderful dinner and a GREAT WAY to start our all girls night out!\n\nWill definitely come back for the whole fish again and again.. and AGAIN!"

            "review": "I can only give 2 stars when you have an expectation and the restaurant has poor service and stratospheric, mesospheric prices.  The Capital Grille makes this place look like a healthier, far costlier Long John Silvers.  \n\nThe plus (singular) was the lobster cocktail, notwithstanding the shell chips and pervasive claw meat.  \n\nThe negatives were after the trade show at 5pm in an empty bar my $7 Heineken took 10 minutes and the cocktail waitress had zero (0) clue what was going on and said \"sorry I'm busy\", and the place was empty.  For dinner our group of 18 had a head waiter who was cocky and arrogant.  I think he showed only a modicum of respect to who he thought was paying the bill.  The entree portions were really small.  From what I recall the scallop entree my co-worker had was three scallops and he ate them and sarcastically grinned at me.  My $36 fish had to be just 5 ounces, seriously, and due to the size of the group it was not warm on the surface just inside.  I really, REALLY like the Ca\u00f1onita in Venetian and 5-starred after multiple visits, but Aqua-Knox has portion sizes weirder than it's name and our arrogant waiter must be a millionaire doing his job for fun."

My only complaint involves a policy they appear to subscribe to.  We arrived 20 minutes early for a 6 pm reservation.  The restaurant was nearly empty, and they refused to seat us until exactly 6.  They suggested we wait in the lounge, and of course order cocktails.  We would have ordered cocktails anyway, even if they had seated us right away, but I don't like to be manipulated."

The attentiveness of the Hostesses from the start made us feel so welcomed and important.  The booth seating is lovely as you can still be a part of the restaurant while enjoying the intimacy with your dinner guest(s). Our Server, Brad, was fabulous and extremely informative about our food and wine questions. The food was incredible!  My daughter and I started with the Tuna Tartare with Asian Pear infusion...delicious and so fresh it tasted like it had just landed on shore! Great combination of flavors. Anyway, onto an old classic, surf and turf...thought we'd give it a try. OMG, it was to die for! The filet was so tender you could cut it with a butter knife, and it was the perfect pink for med rare.  The stuffed Lobster (with crabmeat), was totally updated in flavor and delicious. Our server, Brad, described the Banana Cream Pie so well that we decided to give it a go...a wonderful decision on our part. It was the perfect flavor balance.  Frankly, my daughter and I are very knowledgeable about food and this was our favorite restaurant our whole time in Vegas. Brad, our Server, Adrian, who assisted and Melody, the Manager couldn't have been lovelier.  I cannot wait to return to this outstanding restaurant...Bon Apetite!"

            "review": "So, here's what happened...my wife and I were in Vegas for one night on our way to Zion National Park.  We intentionally booked at Caesar's so that we could eat at Mesa Grill, where I have had the best meals of my life. I called to make the reservation, and...Boom!...private party...not open.\n\nDagnabbit!\n\nWhat to do? My wife loves seafood, so I Yelped seafood restaurants, and found great reviews for AquaKnox at the Venetian. Took a chance, and man, was it worth it! Simply the best service I have ever received at a Vegas upscale restaurant.\n\nOur server (and assistant) constantly brought over little extras. For example, my wife had mentioned how good the corn and edamame succotash looked, but it didn't some with her entree.  Right after her main arrived, she was brought a dish of the succotash on the house. And it was incredible!\n\nHere's the food breakdown:\n\nWe started with the Ahi tuna tartare. One of the best I've had. The Korean chili added the perfect amount of heat and the tiny pieces of crispy tempura and Asian pear brought great texture and a little crunch.\n\nWe followed with the lobster bisque. Um...drool...I mean...can't speak...still in catatonic stupor. 'Nuff said. We also had the butter lettuce and herb salad with champaign vinaigrette. Very fresh and balanced.\n\nMains: I had the scallops on corn puree and soft polenta. Seared perfectly, but the star of the plate was the mixture of the puree and polenta. And just for a neat little surprise, there were three pork cracklins in the center. Cleaned the plate and would have eaten more. My wife had the whole grilled sea bass. She loved it. It had a nice mesquite flavor and was perfectly cooked.\n\nWe ended with the banana cream pie with Guinness chocolate ice cream. The pie was unique and yummy. Not a traditional BCP. They layer ladyfingers throughout. What I liked most about it was that it wasn't overly sweet like a lot of BCP. The star of the dish, though, was the ice cream. When you paired a bite of pie with the ice cream, it was unreal. I could have eaten a whole pint.\n\nAs a nice closer, they brought over a delicious, cold digestif, with a small brownie.\n\nI have found my second \"go to\" restaurant in Vegas. Highly recommended!"

The group had a seafood platter -- a nice assortment of raw fish and a great oyster shooter. This is a nice start actually very filling. Another must is the lobster bisque soup -- truly a must. I had the crab stuffed lobster which was really very good and tasty. The lobster was tough I could not cut it out of the shell. My friends were disappointed in the wine list we had two OK bottles of wine in my opinion. The services was great. \nI don't know if I would go back to this place for anything other than the Aquatini and Lobster Bisque. I enjoyed my meal but there are so many other places to try. . . .\nif you have not been go you will enjoy."

The Seafood plateau was large enough for 4 but its recommended for 2. We were on the full side when we had finished the entire platter. \nFor our entrees, I ordered the crab stuffed lobster. My bf ordered the filet mignon and grilled whole fish(this was for the both of us to share). The server had asked us prior to deboning the fish if we would like him to bring the fish back after deboning or if we wouldn't mind him doing it in front of us. I told him to just have at it at at table side. I wanted to watch how it was done. The seafood was very fresh and light. I loved the combo of the crab stuffed lobster. It was very flavorful. No need for drawn butter. The steak was cooked to my bf's specifications. The fish was delightful. It was citrisy and perfectly seasoned. \nYou would expect good service since you're paying a good amount for dinner and it didn't disappoint. This is why I love to pay a little extra for food just to get wonderful service. :)"

Service was the worst I have ever had. Group of 8. In an empty restaurant (should have been a clue) treated like an annoyance once we declined the waiter's suggestion $200 bottle of wine. Waiter made subtle comments about us splitting salads, and how normally people order full salads with dinner which is why our dinner was so delayed.  Once our waiter realized that we weren't going to have a $1,000 bill, it was the last we saw of him.  Just a few visits from the assistant waiter to refill water.  \n\nUpon leaving we were visited by our waiter one last time to get a small tray of sweets on the house since \"none of you bothered to order dessert\".  Very nice of him to say.  \n\nAnyway it was by far the worst experience I have had in a restaurant in Vegas.  I am there frequently for business and have eaten at many restaurants on and off the strip.  This was by far the worst dining experience I have ever had."

We needed a good quiet quality (yet light) meal in the Venetian Hotel.  So as we strolled Restaurant Row we came upon Aquaknox.\n\nWe were seated at a nice quiet table with very comfortable chairs.  Mine was a bit broken needing some repair.  However, I was exhausted and had no desire to get up or say anything.  Spent some time sipping on an ice cold beefeater gin and tonic simply relaxing.\n\nThe Fish Soup as an entr\u00e9e ($46) sounded like the perfect reward for a hard day.  2 of us chose the Fish Soup and one of us opted for the salmon.  Note:  Our waiter Hilton was wonderful.\n\nThe soup was delicious.  Huge New Zealand mussels in a lovely tomato broth with lobster, massive shrimp and clams.  Crusty pieces of garlic bread complemented this lovely concoction.  There was some kind of rise or quinoa in the soup.  It was a wonderful dish - bottom line.\n\nFor desert we split the ice cream trio.  There were three flavors yet only the cinnamon truly stood out.\n\nBottom line - great meal.  Will I eat here again?  Absolutely.  Nice to find good food in a strip hotel (finally)."

We ordered a bottle of wine recommended by our waiters, which worked well with the food and was decently priced.  We started off with an amuse bouche, which was basically a bite sized caprese salad, which was delicious, but not particularly all that creative.  We split the platter as an appetizer, which was a ridiculous amount of food.  Had we had just the platter and dessert, all of us would have left happy and full.  There were oysters, crab, mussels, shrimp, lobster, oyster shooters, and we got the other crab upsell.  I would say that the shrimp ceviche was really disappointing as the shrimp was rubbery and there wasn't a lot of flavor.  The stone crab however was delicious.  I got the lobster stuffed with crab and holy crap was that a huge lobster -- at least a 2.5 pounder.  Next time, I'm definitely going to ask how big it is.  It however didn't go to waste as I just took it home and ate it as lunch the next day (as an aside: I asked them to crack everything and they told me they did.  The claws were kinda cracked, but kinda half assed so I had to leave a lot of meat in the claw because I couldn't get to it at work).  My father had the prawns which were tasty and my husband had the yellowfin which was also delicious.  I'm not really sure if the dining experience really merited the price, but the seafood was definitely very fresh.  I guess I felt they relied very heavily on the top quality nature of their seafood instead of any real creativity in the cooking and flavoring.

We had Chris and his assistant(did not catch his name. Tall guy with glasses and SUPER friendly). The service was excellent. They checked on us often and we did not wait long for our food to come out. \n\nFor appetizers we had the lobster bisque and the crab cakes. My boyfriend loved his bisque. The crab cakes are a MUST! It is served over a corn relish that compliments the crab cakes very well! For our entrees I had the scallops and he had the Baramundi. He absolutely loved the Baramundi. My scallops were pretty good also. Everything tasted super fresh. Definitely give this place a try if you are craving seafood while in Vegas!!!!"

We had reservations but if we hadn't, I'm sure we would have been seated on this particular night since it was not crowded.\n\nI agree with another reviewer who said the decor reminded them of South Beach.  I thought the same thing walking in with all the blues and whites. Very pretty and chic.\n\nI was feeling kind of sick and can only vouch for the EXCELLENT lobster bisque and jumbo lump crab cocktail that I had. \n\nMy boyfriend, on the other hand, had the Surf and Turf \"special\" which he said was very good...but much like any other steak and lobster he's had in other upscale restaurants. I guess the only thing special about it was the $85 price tag. \n\nStill 4-stars to AquaKnox because we enjoyed everything AND the service was top-notch.\n\nAnother plus: I wasn't drinking and one of the waiters asked me why not...I told him I wasn't feeling so great and  in 2 seconds, he brought me a pretty blue drink.  I don't like colorful (translated, sweet) drinks but tried to drink a little. I didn't like it and tried to just let it sit there but the waiter said he would make it less sweet and brought it back.  He was trying so hard to make it better. I ended up just apologizing that I didn't drink it.  However, I thought it was a sweet gesture that he didn't have to do."

This was a middle-class splurge for us in every sense of the word due to the occasion and the restaurant's performance was exemplary.  We were going to order a couple of appetizers for the group and the waiter whispered in my ear that those were meant to be individual servings.  He talked me into two of the combo seafood plates for the table and even though they were $78 each, I would order them again.  They were just fantastic with lobster, crab legs, oysters on the half shell, and different types of shrimp.  Everyone loved it.  They even gave us warm towels and fresh lemons to wash our hands with afterwards.\n\nI was the only one to order the 1 lb. lobster and steak combo.  It wasn't on the menu but I figured $100 and it was $93.50.  I'd order it again.  The lobster was wonderful and they even gave me a little melted butter heated by an open flame...nice touch!  The steak was a beautifully tender cut and cooked to a perfect medium rare as ordered..  We had several different entrees on the table and everyone loved what they had. \n\nThe desserts were exquisite.  My wife of a couple hours and I shared a hazelnut chocolate dessert with berry mousse and it was outstanding.  The final point I would make is that the service was just flawless by all staff who participated from the waiter to the wine guy to the bus boys.  The evening and this meal were truly memorable for us.\n\nYes, it is an expensive restaurant by our middle-class standards but we knew that when we made the reservation.  We felt it was well worth it because it wasn't just a meal,  Aquaknox made it a memory! \n\nDale"

My family and I are frequent diners along the Las Vegas strip and we've had our share of fine dining (Joel Robuchon, Picasso, Le Cirque, N9NE steakhouse, Eiffel Tower, etc.) and not once has Aquaknox disappointed us! I also lived in San Francisco/Bay Area for 5 years and nothing has compared to the quality of food or service that this restaurant provides!\n\nAquaknox's level of service is unparalleled. With the advent of their new manager, Min, we are always being taken care of and leave satisfied beyond our heart's content. One evening, my mother had requested for a pina colada, but it was not on their menu as they did not have a blender. My mom had no problem requesting for another drink, yet Min personally ran to neighboring restaurants to find a blender. For years, this has been our go-to seafood place (not to mention our favorite restaurant) when we're looking for a fancier-than-normal-kind-of-night.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend the following dishes:\n- Steamed mussels (request for extra bread!)\n- Lobster cocktail w/ citrus garlic aioli\n- Sweet shrimp and lump crab salad\n- Lobster bisque (you can smell its heavenly essence from across the table)\n- Filet mignon / Surf n Turf\n- Pacific prawns on couscous with lobster cream\n- Red Snapper on truffle potato puree\n\nIf you're looking for good seafood and a good time, go to Aquaknox. You can't beat it!"

I found this place through, where else, yelp. They had reservations on open table, so I made on for 7:15pm. We called to see if they could push it back 15 minutes but we were told they had a few large parties and unfortunately could only do 7:15. When we got there on time, NO LARGE PARTIES TO BE SEEN!\n\nOh well, other than that, the service was great and food was impeccable. We even snuck in a small cake for our boss and they brought it out for us with a candle and cut it for us, free of charge. \n\nThey have a small room in the blue circular tower you will see when you walk by. It's their wine cellar plus a private room for about 6-8 people. I would love to eat in there!\n\nWe ordered a few drinks and a few appetizers. 2 ahi tunas, steamed mussles and the crab cake. All of them-wow! The ahi was so fresh and actually very big for an appetizer. The crab cake wasn't mashed up crab, it was huge chunks of blue crab. The steamed mussels were in a delicious broth and also had a lot.\n\nThe chef even sent out a small tasting of crab and spinach on a cracker for us, also amazing! \n\nEverything looked so good that I had a hard time deciding what to get. The entire table wasn't sure! We ordered: scallops, seafood soup, seabass and ahi tuna dinner. Everyone said nothing but amazing things about their meal. I ordered the seabass and I wish the plate never ended. It came with a sweet corn on the bottom-wow. I think next time I will get the seafood soup, it was huge and you literally got to try it all. The broth was flavorful and light. \n\nI can easily say I will come back. Great service and great good!"

I have actually wanted to try AquaKnox for years, but it took me 10 years to get over here.  What is wrong with me?! I've been missing out on this fabulous place for an entire decade.  Well, I finally remedied that problem and I am so glad I did.  My last dinner at AquaKnox ranks in my Top 10 dinners of my life!  \n\nList of reasons to dine at AquaKnox:\n\n1. Oh my goodness, this food is outstandingly brilliant.  We had a 7 course chef's tasting and my mind was blown after each dish.  I am not really an adventurous seafood eater, but I was at AquaKnox, so I went for it!  Every dish was so gorgeous that I had to try it immediately.  I tried so many new proteins, some of which I have never liked before, and loved every single bite!  \n\nEvery single dish was marvelous, but there were a few standouts.  My absolute favorite course was the duo plate of the Alaskan King Crab Cake and Lobster Bisque.  The Alaskan King Crab Cake was the best crab cake I have ever eaten.  I'm not even sure how the cakes hold together because it is mostly giant hunks of crab!  It is also served with a tasty apple slaw.  It was then paired with a delightful cup of Lobster Bisque that is served with a crostini topped with creme fraiche and caviar. Delish!  This soup had so many layers of flavor and was just enchanting to my senses.  This is definitely a most order dish!\n\nMy favorite entree was the Sablefish \"Butterfish.\" This was my first time having this fish and it blew my mind.  It was served with a miso glaze on top of a corn puree with breaded eggplant on the side.  I found this to be so complex and interesting.  The fish itself was fantastic with the miso glaze.  The eggplant and corn added extra levels of flavor that were surprising, but really worked well together.\n\nThe most adventurous course was the Warm Octopus Carpaccio.  I'm not usually an octopus fan, but I really enjoyed it this time.  The citrus vinaigrette really complimented and bought out some great flavors.  Go figure, I do like octopus!\n\nOf course no meal at a seafood resturant is complete without the classic Surf & Turf dish.  AquaKnox knocked this out of the park.  We had the Filet with a Brazilian Lobster Tail.  It is a classic, but was as fantastic! \n\n2. The customer service is top notch!  From the moment to get to the restaurant, you are pampered.  The service here is just amazing.  The servers are so friendly and helpful. They help you along the way to make sure you get exactly what you need and want.  They check on you regularly and you never have to ask for anything because they are a step ahead the entire meal.  I was lucky enough to have the service team of Jesse and Tonya.  If you are going to AquaKnox, I highly recommend you request their section.  You will not regret it!\n\n3. The sommelier, Louis, and the wine! During our menu tasting, we also opted for the sommelier's choice wine pairing.  I know absolutely nothing about wine except that it is made out of grapes.  I am zero help with picking wine, so I was ecstatic to have such a brilliant sommelier to help us with some wonderful wines for each course.  I also really liked how Louis gave us so much information about the types of grapes used, as well as the region where the wine is produced.  Educational and delicious, how fun!  I wish I could remember them all so I could go buy some for myself.  \n\n4. The desserts! We had 2 desserts.  We had a flourless chocolate cake, which was good. The coup de gr\u00e2ce was the butterscotch bread pudding.  Wow, wow, wow this dessert was spectacular! It was a thing of beauty, flavor explosion, and just all around yummy.  Just order it and bathe in it's beauty!\n\n5. The restaurant is beautiful! The seats are comfortable, the color scheme is visually appealing, and it is just a pleasant place to be in.  It is really just a lovely place to go for a nice dinner.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you are a local or a tourist, you need to go experience this magnificent restaurant.  I promise you will love every moment as much as I did.  Bon appetit!"

The menu is not extensive, so it may not cater to some (or many) taste buds, but I'll be damned if that wasn't the most well-prepared halibut I've ever had. The dishes look simple, but I truly appreciate every bite, a subtle flavor that lingers on your palate the rest of the night. The complimentary white chocolates are icing on the cake.\n\nDo not come here hungry - you will not be stuffed. Come here when you want your taste buds satiated with an interesting take on seafood."

We had a \"Tour of the Menu\" with wine paring!  I literaly floated out after dinner!  We started off with the Aquaknox Plateau for 2!  The presentation is Beautiful!  I would love to tell my favorite,  but the ENTIRE plateau was incredible, Lobster, Oysters, Prawns, Crab, Mussels, and Ponzu Oyster Shooters I was in SEAFOOD HEAVEN!  The Lobster Bisque was Perfectly Creamy, very comforting, get that warm fuzzy feeling when it slides down!  The Crab Cakes were Outstanding!  Our Filet's were cooked to perfection, just the way I love to eat it! I mean you can't ask for more!  They give it ALL UP!  The service was Stellar!  From our Server to our Somm. everything was Remarkable!  I happen to love the seating there as well, they offer the coziest booths if you are looking for a little bit more privacy while you indulge!  Very elegantly decorated and they have a most beautiful water wall on the way in!  The Venetian has done it once again, another NOT TO MISS spot in Las Vegas, Aquaknox!"

Excellent Service, Delicious Food, Modern & Chic Ambience.....I loved it here!\n\nMy girlfriends and I started the evening with a cocktail from the bar: A Blue Martini (forgot the name). Delicious but sweet, so we switched to wine during dinner. The restaurant wasn't busy so it wasn't loud. I loved the interior. Very modern and warm. We picked a booth and it was perfect for three of us.....intimate and good for catching up on things. \n\nAnyway, Thank You fellow Yelpers for recommending the Maine Lobster Bisque! I loved it and savored every bite. The best lobster bisque I've ever eaten. A little rich but flavored perfectly, and topped with little clumps of lobster. Perfect! I also had the Sweet Shrimp and Lump Crab Salad and it was excellent as well. I'm not a big eater, so those two appetizer-sized dishes were a perfect dinner for me. \n\nAnother must-have: Crab Stuffed Whole Maine Lobster! My friend ordered it and we helped her finish it. It's massive....The whole lobster comes out on a huge plate and you just stare at it! The lobster was so tasty that it didn't even need butter. \n\nSorry no dessert recommendations. Too full!\n\nI must commend the staff at Aquaknox for their excellent service! The hostess who greeted us, the bartender who served our drinks at the bar, and of course our wait staff were all so welcoming and polite. Special thanks to our waiters, who were very attentive, open for suggestions/recommendations, accommodating, and skilled at their job. I noticed they even held out a white cloth to prevent splashing while pouring our waters! Thank You for making our visit to Aquaknox such an enjoyable experience! I will be back soon...."

This serene, and comfortable restaurant is sandwiched between many other fine dining restaurants, from French (Pinot Brasserie), whimsical and creative American cuisine (David Burke), to Emeril (Delmonico Steakhouse). Their prized seafood, flown in daily, is 80% of the dinner menu, also, boasts an expansive, wine list. The menu includes signature dishes, such as, the seafood plateau (enough for two).  The plateau includes, 3 mussels, 3 clams, 3 prawns, 2 crab claws, 6 oysters on a half shell, 2 oyster ponzu shooters, and a small dish of shrimp ceviche (side note: massive dish, prawns were shrimp, ponzu shooters were too sweet and might be a lil on the spicy side for the general public). The presentations of the John Dory with lobster stuccotash and sweet corn broth and Jumbo Louisana Prawns on a bed of curried forbidden black rice were aesthetically appealing, but a tad under-seasoned. Again, very fresh seafood. Dessert; Pear Frangipane with Vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce, garnished with a pear chip and a Mint Chocolate Cake with mint ice cream and a chocolate sauce, garnished with chocolate flutes, once again, aesthetically pleasing, although, the ice cream somewhere other than on top of the cake. The service was a roller coaster. Our server, somewhat disappeared and another server/food runner took over and saved her. Otherwise, a great dining experience.\nCasino parking.\nFood: 7 Service: 7 Cost: $65/person\n3 1/2 Stars"

This restaurant had the best food I've ever had and the personal service made it spectacular! \n\nI would recommend them highly.

Menu changes no longer make it the place to grab a quick bite.  Opt for the comfortable, contemporary ambiance of the main dining room instead.  While the executive chef has changed, taking with him the best of the best, enough remains and new dishes added that still carry the cuisine.\n\nIn general, seafood is very fresh and always perfectly cooked.  Never any albumin on fillets.  No bouncing scallops or shrimp.\n\nTop starters include an outstanding wild blue crab cake (very little filler, dusted in flour and fried crisp served with a chayote slaw and a gently spiced creole remoulade).  Very well balanced dish with great texture, sweetness paired with an acidic punch.  The Maine lobster louie also excellent with just cooked through, firm and sweet lobster with traditional veg (I'm not a bunny but this is good).  A kicked up, creamy 1,000 island dressing and heirloom tomatoes with greater acidity and lower sweetness truly compliment the lobster.\n\nMains are simple but perfectly executed.  A perfectly pan roasted, moist, Alaskan halibut pairs perfectly with the chili flavor of a piquillo pepper relish.  The fish soup outstanding.  A acidic tomato base, the hint of saffron and perfectly cooked chunks of lobster, firm john dory, tender PEIs, briny clams, and sweet prawns.   A porcini dusted, perfectly cooked moonfish served with a red wine reduction dashi sauce is incredible for it's complexity and depth of flavor.  Mushroom and fish?  It works with the earthiness adding an unexpected umame finish.  Finally, the Georges Bank Scallops with blood orange butter, amazing.  Perfectly seared and cooked just through.  Incredibly sweet.  The blood orange butter adding even more richness and acidity to brighten the dish further.  Yes there are sides but who cares.  The scallops are the focus.\n\nOutstanding service.  Very friendly, efficient, and accommodating.  Some dishes were shared, portions divided and individually plated in the kitchen.  \n\nVery good wine list heavily centered around whites that pair perfectly with their cuisine.  Vegas resort markup.\n\nWhen it comes to Aquaknox, remember the dieters mantra, \"when you see food, eat it!\""

There were only four courses, two of which were barely warm.  The crabcake was very fresh, but lacked the big chunks of crab that you should see at a nice seafood restaurant. It would have been better if it was hot. The truffled kabocha pumpkin gnocci was the only dish that impressed me. Again, not hot enough. For the entree, I expected to see lobster or crab as one of the options, after all it was New Years Eve in Vegas! Not so, I ended up eating chicken coq au vin, which was moist but I wanted something more gourmet than chicken. Beef was an option but I don't eat it. The dessert would have been good but it contained peanut butter, which I despise. A lot of people have peanut allergies, so I can't believe this was the only option they had. And they never even announced that it had peanut butter, they should have noted it on the menu. My gf did the wine pairing, she did not like most of the wines. I would never come here for a holiday prix fixe ever again. The service was friendly, but a little slow considering the place wasn't exactly packed. They took forever to bring the bill and process it."

And I've always had servers ask still, sparkling, or tap. This server didn't even ask! And they kept refilling our cups without us asking and without letting us know how many bottles we've used so we ended up paying for many bottles of water. So I guess let them know if you want tap water instead of bottled water. I don't mind paying for bottled water if that's what I'm expecting to do but we didn't even know until the bill came.\n\nFor appetizers we ordered the Seafood Plateau but it was $79 and serves only TWO people. Granted it does come with a variety of items but our server suggested this appetizer for our group of 8 but failed to mention the price. So $79 times 4 plus our main entrees equals a hefty tip for him. That Bastard. \n\nBut the food alone was delicious and fresh so if the service was better, then I would have given it 4 stars easily. But since they tried to sell us every expensive thing on the menu it deserves only one star. I will never return. I've never experienced this before at any other upscale establishment so I guess that's why I felt so cheated.\n\nBut if you do want to eat here then get the ponzu and sake oyster shooters. We had multiple shots."

The restaurant theme is 'global water cuisine' and the decor attempts to evoke the sea with waterfalls and aqua hued walls and ceilings.  \n\nThe meal began with an amuse of a smoked salmon mousse paired with breadsticks.  The mousse was smooth with a nice kick of horseradish and tabasco flavors.  We ordered a platter of 12 oysters for the table to start and then each ordered entrees: seared ahi tuna, scallops, and grilled whole fish.  The oysters (~$30) were the standout of the night: fresh, tender and perfectly briny, served with wedges of lemon and individually-sized bottles of Tabasco sauce.  Perfectly seared, slightly sweet scallops were served on a bed of sweet corn, mushrooms and chive-mashed potatoes.  The grilled fish was accompanied by wonderfully roasted cherry tomatoes which may have eclipsed the fish itself.  The seared ahi was technically perfectly, but the sauce was remarkably (overly?) strong and sweet.  Portion sizes were reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber and prices ran $35 - 40 per entree.  The birthday girl received, on the house, a lovely triangle of rich chocolate cake with a candle and a \"happy birthday\" engraved on a chocolate disk.  Finally, a small plate of complimentary rhombus-shaped chocolate squares finished the meal.\n\nAqua Knox also features an extensive wine list, off of which we ordered the Baileyana Chardonnay ($57), with the help of the sommelier who directed us toward our stated preference for something dry and oaky. \n\nThrough the course of the evening we interacted with two waitresses and two sommeliers.  While all were pleasant, the upselling pressure  was immense.  We were continually directed toward wines more expensive than our preferred range and asked numerous times if we wanted to order more appetizers, salads, soups, and desserts.  Judging by our appearances (nicely dressed but very young) and our firm \"no\"s to all extraneous offers, I would think our price point was clear.  I'm not particularly sensitive to upselling, but the amount of marketing here was enough to leave me with unfond memories.\n\nOverall, exquisite food but not particularly unique nor a great value (although it's hard to imagine that any of the celebrity restaurants in Vegas could be considered a great value).  A solid pick though if you're looking for exceptionally fresh (flown in daily) and well-prepared seafood."

I love knowing that I am attending a place where clearly the staff is being treated well enough leaving them happy to treat the guests just as so. \nThe food portions were amazingly giant and so beautiful. We had the clams, lobster bisque, stuffed lobster and the special surf and turf filet and lobster. Not one complaint about anything we had. Also when you sit down they serve you an amuse buche with your wine. Yum! \n Jesse came out at the end, and brought us a wonderful dessert with banana milk and mousse bites. Lovely writing of happy anniversary in chocolate on the plate (special treatment ) \nThe dinner was worth every penny mostly due to Jesse and his wife, being the best servers we have ever had. As we were leaving I couldn't but help hugging them. Thank you so much for making our night so special. Xoxoxoxoox\nWe will see you next year."

We both had simple grilled fish (the special) over a nicely done risotto.  All in all, a solid meal as expected based on reputation and price point.\n\nWine:  5 stars\nFor the price point and the vibe of the resort we expected an extensive list, a well trained sommelier, and a tip toward Italian.  All was as expected and more so.  The sommelier, a young man named Scott, was well versed in his list and very personable.  We found a '01 Moccagatta Bric Balin Barbaresco, a very happy and unexpected joy!\n\nService:  2 stars\nMaybe it was the lack of staff because of the season, but our waiter was simply not good enough for this price point.  Adequate is a failure in fine dining.\n\nAmbiance:  4 stars\nThey do a nice job of shielding the patrons from most of the hustle and bustle of the resorts.

I had the halibut, which in other less deft hands can be overcooked, but in this case, it was perfectly seasoned and mouth-watering. My friends, both who live far, far away from oceans, had the prawns and scallops and couldn't stop saying how it was the best seafood they had enjoyed in years.\nI'd highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes with thick, moist succulent chunks of lobster that doesn't overpower the potatoes.\nI'd highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you can get a booth, which the manager Min made possible for us.

            "review": "I had dinner here and had a pretty good time! To start, instead of bread, they bring you these long crackers and a smoked salmon cream cheese dip, which was a really nice way to start the dinner. For appetizers we had a roasted beet, watermelon and blue cheese salad, as well as the smoked fish plate. The salad was really awesome. They key was getting a bit of everything on the fork and opening wide: super delicious. The smoked fish plate was alright, though not as good as the salad, and I ended up being more into the pickled veggies that came with the appetizer than the fish itself.\n\nFor entrees, we had the halibut and scallops. The fish was standard good, but the best part of the halibut dish was the marscopone mashed potatoes and tomatoes it came with. Really tasty. Was licking the plate with my fork. The scallops were also pretty good, seared on the outside and buttery on the inside though maybe a tad salty. Once again though, the sauce and accompaniments that came with the scallops were also quite good. We also got a side dish of vegetables, which I highly highly recommend, not just because the veggies taste good, but because you might want to actually eat something.\n\nWe got two desserts. The olive oil semolina cake with blue berry compote and orange basil sorbet just wasnt that good: the cake part got totally lost amid the strong flavors of the blueberry and sorbet. I guess its going for something subtle and interesting, but it didnt work. However, the flourless chocolate cake, a warm chocolaty concoction with a cup of caramel was super delicious. Definitely on the sweet side, but it had enough real chocolate and caramel flavor to balance the sweetness. Plus if you dont feel self conscious you can just drink the caramel from the little cup it comes in. Yum yum yum.\n\nThe service here is great, very attentive. The decor is also really nice, with some comfortable little booth seats.  Overall, I think we spent about 1.5-2 hours here, and had a good time. \n\nMy only complaint about this place is that the amount of food you get is really really little. Even when it comes to the cheaper sides, like potatoes and tomatoes and veggies. I know Vegas is all about screwing you out of your money, but I feel here it was just too obvious. For example, the \"tomatoes\" that came with my halibut were 2 or 3 small cherry tomatoes. I would have also appreciated more of the potatoes. And of course the actually piece of halibut was pretty small. So yeah, it's pretty obvious they are holding back on the food to get you to order more. Even the lack of real bread speaks to that. Finally, the prices of course have the 20-30% \"vegas strip surcharge\", but I chose to ignore that in this review."

We were greeted by very friendly hostesses which was a good sign. They were all very kind and although we were quite casually dressed, they invited us in anyway. Bonus points for them. \n\nThe restaurant is quite classy with white linens, a very modern feel, darker lighting and a really cool wine cooler that's a focal point in the front of the restaurant.\n\nWe were shown to our table and we were greeted by our waiters. They worked in tandem, which was quite cool as we were never thirsty or left wanting for anything. They brought out a wonderful amuse bouche that was spread over bread sticks. Very nice beginning and more than a bite so that was nice.\n\nWe decided to go all out and really enjoy this meal, so we each got appetizers. I got the crab cakes ($18) that were marinated with vegetable relish, citrus aioli, and petite mache.  They are smaller, but there was not any filling as it was all crab. Very nice change from those giant crab cakes that are 50% filler. Worth every bite. \n\nMy girlfriend got the Lobster Bisque ($15). It contained Maine lobster, caviar, and creme fraiche. Wow. It was flavorful, with the creme cutting the richness a bit, but not too much. I never had bisque with caviar and it did add a nice little touch. \n\nNext up, the main dishes which we sort of shared. The Georges Bank Scallops ($34) included black truffle creamed corn, with apple-wood smoked bacon polenta. The scallops were perfectly seared and cooked properly. I haven't had one like this in ages, and it really brought back memories from eating them as a kid. The polenta was pretty tasty as well, but I liked it more than she did. \n\nThe Wild Barramundi ($35) included a tasty chive potato puree, baby tomatoes, and was topped with an asparagus-wild mushroom vinaigrette. I liked it a lot. I didn't know what to expect from the texture, which is a more on the oily side. It worked for me. It was quite moist and flavorful. The potato puree was amazing and went so well with the fish. \n\nWe had no room left after the meal so we skipped dessert. All in all, I would really recommend this restaurant for the friendly service, kind hostesses, great atmosphere and of course the food. If you're in town, definitely consider this place for a great seafood meal."

Not exceptional, was still decent.  HORRIBLE service...my boyfriend and I kept thinking that we were getting punk'd because the staff kept doing too many things just outright weird.....like we asked for bread, we were told that the \"Chef is stingy with bread\", but we can opt for breadsticks! yippie!!!! Ok, fine. We order the breadsticks, and they never show up with them. Our food took forever, we had to leave our table to get the waiter to us, had to pour our own wine and the list goes on.\nBut the most disappointing aspect of this whole experience.......how they are like used car salesmen, tapping in an extra charge here and there, \"accidentally\" double charging for appetizers AND suggesting splitting a dish and charging full price plus a splitting charge.  I think the restaurant is sinking in the sea of fine establishments in las vegas and is desperate to keep their margin high.  NEVER will we go here again, crappy service overpowers delicious crabcakes."

However, I had some pangs of hesitation when I saw pictures of the restaurant online. It looked sort of cold to me and I wondered how our meal would be, given that environment. But we made our reservations and were so, SO surprised at how nice the restaurant was once we got there. I don't think the pictures do it any justice. It was lovely and we were so happy we decided to try it anyway!\n\nThe service was most excellent! Friendly, informative, attentive and timely. We could not have asked for better. And, the food! We loved it! Interesting choices, wonderful flavour, creative presentations... so, SO good! We would go back there in a heartbeat. We loved it!"

First impression:  very soothing colors in shades of blue, green and cream.  They have a really cool little private dining room with seating for about 4 or 5 inside a round glass wine display.  Imagine dining with bottles and bottles of wine surrounding you.  ;)  They have a few pretty water displays too.  \n\nThe restaurant was not very busy, but to be honest, Vegas itself seemed pretty empty this trip.  The economy perhaps?  Anyway, our waiter and busboy were both very pleasant and helpful.  We had three coupons for complimentary Aquatinis...don't mind if we do!  It was a very pretty drink, but a little too sweet for my taste.  \n\nI split the beet salad with my sister.  It was served with a rather sweet dressing.  Thank goodness for the blue cheese crumbles which did a great job balancing out the sweetness.  I found several entrees on the menu that sounded really good, but I chose the grouper.  It was rice crusted and served over green tea-infused soba noodles.  As separates, everything was very tasty, but together it was a rather odd combo of flavors.  If I went back I would probably order the scallops like my dad or the John Dory like my mom and sister.  \n\nWe all split a Lemon Crush dessert which was excellent.  It consisted of the most amazing lemon cake, a little round cookie on top of the cake and a scoop of ice cream.  The presentation of all of our dishes was very pleasing."

This is a place I would definitely try again. \n\nThe service was great as well.My friend dropped a little cocktail sauce on her white shirt and was trying to wipe it off with a napkin when the waiter immediately appeared and dropped off some soda water. They were so quick and attentive, it was very impressive.\n\nWe tried a bunch of appetizers and the seafood plateau. Let me tell you, that seafood plateau thing is to die for. It has clams, mussels, oysters, prawns, ceviche, lobster, crab, and ponzu oyster shooters (the yummiest oyster shooters I've ever tried). If you love seafood, you HAVE to try this. I can't even remember what other appetizers I ordered because they were good, but paled in comparison."

The trout was tough and chewy, the cod was bland and tasteless, and I've had better smoked salmon out of the package from Costco.  Our waiter encouraged me to order the New Zealand Blue Nose Bass because they \"had just gotten it in,\" but it was overcooked and had no flavor whatsoever.  The pureed potatoes that accompanied it were equally unexciting.  My boyfriend had the surf and turf, and while the lobster was good, he said he's had better elsewhere and everything else was forgettable.  The service was fine.  The best part was an amuse bouche made of salmon and cream (and dill?), served with breadsticks.  I was looking forward to eating here based on the reviews, and I really, really wanted to like it,  but it was easily one of the most disappointing meals I've ever had in Las Vegas."

The crab was dry and had that ammonia taste and smell to it...yuck! The teeniest tiniest lobster imaginable was dry dry dry. Way over priced for that quality seafood.

We originally had a dinner planned somewhere else but due to some people bailing we had to find somewhere else. A friend had recommended this restaurant. The staff was very polite and and sat us promptly. The menu was explained well and we were told of the nights specials. It wasn't until after we received our first round of drinks and appetizer that everything started to go downhill. The portion size is what I had expected and tasted really good but the service went right in the toilet. After our appetizer arrived my dad asked for a mexicana coffee. It took half an hour for that to arrive and nobody came back in between that time to ask anyone if they wanted drinks. When the waiter finally came back with the mexicana coffee he placed it in front of me,  not my dad. 15 minutes later we flagged him down to place another drink order. I asked for a mohito and my aunt asked for wine. The waiter took orders from half the table and took off without asking anyone else. He came back with two sangrias to which we told him we never ordered. The other end of the table never got a chance to order and actually had to walk across the hall to another store to get some wine and my mohito never showed up. Myself, my dad and my cousin's steak was not cooked how we asked for it. My cousin asked for well done to which he received charbroiled outside and red inside. I asked for medium rare and got rare. My dad asked for medium and got medium rare to rare. Throughout the night we had 4 different waiters serve us. Our collective overall experience was not good. I will not go here again nor will I recommend it to anyone else."

The meals were a true example of what happens when a trained chef knows how to combine flavors for an amazing meal. I had the scallops that were tender and bursting with the flavors on the plate. The butternut squash and brussels sprouts perfectly paired with the scallops. My husband had the salmon with forbidden rice. His dish was also the perfect combination of flavors and possibly even better than my dish. For dessert I had the butterscotch bread pudding. I love butterscotch and rarely find this as a dessert offering. I realized half-way through that I was shaking my head \"yes\" with each bite. So moist and full of butterscotch flavor. I can't wait to come back here and enjoy another top notch meal."

Plus they had a weird buttery taste which I did not enjoy. The salad was a nice size and was good enough, but not great. It had a little too much dressing on it for my liking, so I would recommend getting it on the side. We also had two bottles of Chardonnay, but the name of the exact bottles we had escapes me. The wine list is extensive and has a variety of price points which was helpful especially in a group.\n\nI wouldn't return to Aquaknox to dine, but it is a good place to grab a drink or two before heading across the hall to VBar."

Since most of our meals were pre-arranged catered events (we were in town for a convention), this became a rather difficult decision given our myriad restaurant options and only one night to dine out!  \n\nIn the end, my companion and I decided on Aquaknox.  We were both in the mood for seafood and some tasty cocktails.  I had been warned by other reviewers that the decor might be a bit cheesy (think 80s, Miami Vice, was what I remembered one reviewer wrote).  However, when we arrived there we were pleasantly surprised.  Surrounded by \"waterfalls\" on the windows and soft lights that changed from shades of green to blue, I actually felt a tranquil and calming influence instead of the modern, angular harshness that I had expected.  I ordered a Red Lotus martini and my companion had their signature Aquatini.  We found ourselves immediately relaxed.\n\nWe were both very happy with our appetizers and entrees.  The portions were perfect -- neither too big nor small, enough to satisfy my appetite without leaving me feeling too full.  My salad was loaded with ample servings of shrimp and crab.  The lobster bisque was delicious.  My grouper entree with the miso broth, soba noodles, shiitake mushrooms and bok choy was fresh and flavorful.  The scallops were seared to perfection.  \n\nAbove all, we were most impressed with the service.  We had about 4 waiters serving us throughout our meal.  Each was pleasant and courteous (not intrusive), explained their portion of the menu well, and not once did we feel an air of pretense.  Our experience at Aquaknox shows how a restaurant can provide excellent food and service without the snobbishness that too often accompanies upscale dining."

We were seated right in the middle of the restaurant, in full view of the bar, kitchen in the back, and all tables around us. The ambiance is dim, classy and modern; pretty much what was expected of an upscale seafood restaurant in Vegas. Most of our party were wearing black dresses so we were served with black napkins right away which was much appreciated. Our reservation was at 5:30 with the restaurant at about maybe 30% occupancy in my opinion which was great because the service was impeccable. Our waiter was very attentive and patient while us girls were taking photos. They took our orders right away and came back with updates every few minutes. They first gave us a sample of their crab risotto as compliments from the chef which turned out to be a nice little appetizer. Our main dishes probably came out in about 20 minutes which was perfect. I ordered the Ora King Salmon which was probably the best salmon dish I have ever had! The forbidden rice, peppers, relish on top was just phenomenal. Definitely worth it. We were all so full and decided to forego dessert, but yet again we received complementary ginger tea & madeleines, compliments of the chef. Such a nice gesture since we were there celebrating.

Yelpers = foodies right??\n\nI ordered the infamous Lobster Bisque soup that everyone keeps talking about. And whoa....THAT BOWL WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!! Plus that small scoop of caviar on top of a crunchy bread stick a great additional as well. That was enough to get me half full.\n\nMy date suggested the Peruvian sea bass as our main dish. In the end, I was glad I agreed to his suggestion. I know fish is a healthy alternative. I normally drench my fish...or any type of seafood in lemon, peppers, sauces...all types of condiments. I like to mask that \"seafood-y taste.\" But THIS sea bass did not need ANY of that. It was flavorful enough for me...and I'm big on flavoring. Also, what I really liked about this was the addition of mashed potatoes with a slight hint of crab meat. These two definitely complimented each other. \n\nMaking reservations is highly recommended."

Aquaknox at The Venetian!\n\nJust to give you a vague idea of what to expect from this place...the crabcake appetizer is $15 and comes on a tiny plate with TWO ping-pong ball sized pieces. You would think for about $7.50 a piece, they should taste AMAZING, but no. You can purchase better tasting seafood prepackaged at Costco or Safeway.\n\nSo not only was it extremely expensive, the food was completely unappetizing, flavorless and our group left HUNGRY.\n\nThis is one of those places where your $45/person bill is paying for the decor and atmosphere, not your food.\n\nHonestly, save yourself some money and take it elsewhere. Don't let the fancy decorations, designer chairs and tables fool you into walking in."

We were seated quite fast to our table and were greeted by Hillary (man) and Norman.  They waited on us like there was no tomorrow.  Since I don't eat fish.  I ordered the rib eye steak, shrimp cocktail, a glass of red wine and flourless chocolate cake.  He ordered that same, except he had crab for the appetizer. It was the first time I ever ate crab meat.   It was specatular..  I thought this restaurant was in the Palazzo; but I see here it says Venetian.   The total bill was $247.  So it is a bit pricey; but well worth it.!!! I highly recommend it. The ambience was great and it quickly filled up.  I looked up and saw the almost every table was taken.  Thank you AquaKnox.!!

Probably the worst bread I have ever had a restaurant. Wait..the food got a lot better after that. \n\nI tried the peach, tomoate and mozzarella salad. The cheese was the softest mozzarella I have ever had, very creamy consistency. The gave just enough for the salad. The salad was different beacuse of the peaches. I think I would have liked it more if it had been more traditional without the peaches though.\n\nMy date had the lobster bisque. There was hardly any lobster bits in it, but the soup had a nice flavor.\n\nFor the main course, I had the rib cap steak. It was a smaller cut, 8oz. It was served with crispy thin onion rings, mashed potatoes and a sauce. I really liked eating the steak with the onion. The steak was really prepared and very tender. I had asked for medium rare and my date had asked his steak to be medium. They brought out bought at medium. The did quickly replace mine though. I figured they must have had another medium rare one that had just been completed?\n\nFor dessert we had the Belgian Chocolate Smores. The dessert is very rich, I could only eat half of it. The marshmellows were made of a paste instead of an actually marshmellow, which I think would have worked better. The paste was pretty firm. \n\nThe service was nice, there s a waiter and a food runner/water replinsher that helped alot. We say him way more than our waiter. The chef and manager both stopped by briefly to ask how things were.\n\nOverall, we had a good experience. I don't think I will be back as there are many other restaurants in Vegas that I would like to try. If you want steak you must go to Gordon Ramsey's STEAK in the Paris hotel!!"

As a duo, these gentlemen gave us an unforgettable dining experience. I feel so bad for forgetting their names but I believe they were of the Filipino descent. But seriously, it's like they read each other's minds. We would request something from one guy and bam! The other guy pops up with it in literally like 2 seconds. \n\nOnto food....\n\nWe started with 1dz oysters - varying with 3 different kinds. And may I say it was DELISH. \n\nFollowed by the entrees..\nScallops - ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. Deserves more than 5 stars. If the spaghetti squash or squid ink pasta mix up TJ texture along with the perfectly mixed sauce... I just don't even know. Scallops we're cooked medium rare and it was perfect. \n\nMatt ordered a fish, that comes (mostly) deboned paired with veggies, such as potatoes, spinach and something else. But the fish had an amazing freshness to it and a chili flavor. You can get the fish either headless or with the head (your preference) \n\nWe also ordered a side of chef's choose of veggies which worked in our favor. We had a zucchini lightly coated with Panko crust and some cheese flavor. The combination of crunchy panko and a perfectly cooked zucchini?!? A party in our mouths. \n\nWe had a few kamikaze shots from the bar as well and they were fresh and STRONG. \n\nWe ended being way too full for dessert, but the chef was kind enough to have us try his peaches n cream paired with a cheesecake cookie. \n\nIf you're craving seafood, I highly recommend this place - as clearly it is their expertise along with outstanding customer service."

(sucks)  However, the server told us that he can't split the tickets for us.  So, one person had to pay for everything, and the other people would pay to that particular person.  This was very annoying because we each had to make a copy of the receipt, and initial our names by what we ordered.  This whole process took a long time, and a couple of people sitting next to us started to make condescending comments toward us.  For example, they said to us,\"If you don't have any money, then don't eat at this fancy restaurant.\"  I thought to myself, \"what a bunch of idiots!

The idea was the chef would send out dishes to highlight the things they're doing at AquaKnox with the new executive chef.  We gathered at 5:30 and then spent over three hours enjoying good company, good conversation, and great food!  \n\nFor starters, we got an amuse-bouche of scallop ceviche.  Very nice start with some chopped scallop on a tortilla chip.\n\nNext out was a trio of oysters.  One was an oyster shooter in a great liquid with a kick from hot sauce.  The server recommended we drink it all at once or we'd end up getting too much hot sauce at once.  We all listened.  The spiciness lingered for awhile.  Another oyster was their Oyster Rockefeller with crumb top.  It was very tasty.  Finally, there was an oyster from the Northwest with some house made salsa fresca.  Very nice.\n\nNext up was foie gras with a carrot confit on a Nutella infused toast round.  The ingredients went together so well.  This is not on their current menu.  Foie gras is available as a topping for steak.  They're thinking of adding it to the menu.\n\nThen came the AquaKnox fish soup.  The menu describes it as having Mediterranean tomato-saffron broth, Maine lobster, John Dory, mussels, clams, prawns, Sardinian couscous.  There was Ono in the soup last night and the tomato-saffron broth was superb!  The soup had  a rich spiciness to it and was accompanied by two toast points.\n\nThe next course was pan roasted Ono on an artichoke sauce with persimmon and some fingerling potato halves.  The fish was moist, rich, and was just incredibly good.\n\nUp next was their take on surf and turf.  There were two sides to the dish--one with shrimp on couscous.  On the other side was a scallop on a bed of mushrooms over squash pur\u00e9e.  Perfectly cooked with an excellent blend of flavors, this was another outstanding dish.\n\nThe next course was a sampling of three of their steaks.  The steaks are wet aged.  The slices were from their filet, ribeye, and NY strip.  The filet and strip were like butter they were so tender.  The ribeye was a bit tougher.  The trio was served with shishito peppers, cooked onions, and mashed potatoes.\n\nThen came the dessert course.  We were presented with a dish with three dessert samples--Banana cream pie served with a caramelized banana slice, banana cream, and Guinness ice cream.  Another was their take on the classic s'mores.  It had browned marshmallow on chocolate with a graham crust.  Finally, the butterscotch bread pudding with brioche soaked in homemade butterscotch caramel.  Absolutely delicious.  As we were starting these, we were brought a serving of key lime pie with two cherries in glass looking candy.  The presentation was stunning.\n\nNot quite done yet, we were brought cinnamon cayenne cookies and shooter style glasses of hot chocolate.  The cinnamon flavor was similar to candy cinnamon which gave a zing to the cookies.  To end, two of us had double espressos over ice and two had hot green tea.\n\nService was exemplary.  For each course, four servers came together and rounded the table and then placed the dishes in unison.  Excluding me, the group did small wine pairings with each course.  The sommelier expertly explained his selections and described the wines.  My dining partners enjoyed their pairings and I enjoyed my iced tea which was replaced with a fresh one without the need to ask.\n\nA perfectly wonderful meal and I'm pleased to maintain the 5 star level I gave AquaKnox when I first reviewed them during Restaurant Week earlier this year.  A very memorable and filling meal.  Hence my 15 mile bike ride this morning.  Thanks to all those at AquaKnox for making this a perfect evening!"

Probably some of the best bisque I have had in my life.  One member our party had the fish soup and raved about how fantastic it was.  I had the John Dory and it was really good.  It came prepared with a corn and fava bean relish which was light and tasty.  We were told that Aquaknox is known for its John Dory so we expected to be blown away.  It was really good, but not something to be \"known for.\"  What really took this restaurant from four to three stars was that a couple in our group ordered the $68 surf and turf special.  It came out luke warm.  Our waiter took it straight back and cooked them new entrees and the manager apologized, so I have to compliment the service.  However, a $68 meal should never come out cold.\n\nThe decor is uber trendy and fun.  The wine list is extensive and the atmosphere has a great vibe.  Our service was spot on and our waiter answered all questions without hestitation...and with this group, there are always a lot of questions.  We enjoyed our meal, but would probably choose to go back to Delmonico's next door over Aquaknox."

Finally given the chance to try the cuisine, I have to admit that I was not very impressed.  The Sommelier was moderately helpful in the end but during the process of selecting a wine she continuously suggested wines that were clearly out of the price range we were looking.  (I hate when Sommeliers do that.  I'm not going for the $180 bottle of wine tonight, thanks).  In the end she was able to produce two bottles of a nice chardonnay not on the menu.  \n\nThe butter lettuce and herb salad was good, the dressing was nice and light and the salad was a good size.  The shrimp cocktail, however, was not as good.  It was literally downed in cocktail sauce.  I'm the kind of girl that likes to dip (my husband on the other hand likes to smother) and I didn't appreciate the pint of cocktail sauce on my shrimp.

I am not one who enjoys fish, so I perused the menu for an alternative. On that, or any menu, a steak suits me just fine. \n\nIt is fish that I can live without, but I do like shrimp, crab and lobster. Fitting with that, I and my business travel companion shared the Seafood Trio appetizer: sweet shrimp, lobster and jumbo crab served with AquaKnox cocktail sauce. The name is rather misleading as only the shrimp comes with the cocktail sauce. Each of the three meats comes plated with its own unique sauce. Of the three, though I liked them all, the crab was my least favorite. \n\nI ordered their Bone-In Ribeye, though the menu online shows \"Bisteca (32 oz. Prime Double Cut Porterhouse).\" I cannot say if that is new to the menu or if the ribeye is instead. What I can tell you is that the competition in my search for the best steak in Las Vegas just got a little tougher. The ribeye came over root vegetables. I feel bad saying that the ribeye at AquaKnox is one of the best steaks in 'Vegas if it is not even an option anymore. I cannot speak to the porterhouse, though I would be tempted to try a \"serves two\" steak alone! \n\nThe prices were not outrageous, though I had expected them to be. Most main dishes were around $30. If you need to find it, the restaurant is located outside the Blue Man Group Theatre. \n\nAquaKnox has not converted me to the ways of seafood, but through steak they have helped me recommend this restaurant to you. There are so many restaurants in Las Vegas I do not know if I will ever go back to AquaKnox, but it was worth going once for me. And if the situation arose, I would not hesitate to go back."

It distinguishes itself with a smart, concise menu, fresh seafood, and options for all diners.\n\nThey do have a Coconut Tofu curry dish for the vegetarian, which looked intriguing enough to almost order, but we opted for Oysters, John Dory, Crab-Stuffed Lobster, and a Filet.\n\nThe oysters are by the 1/2 dozen, and we received 2 different Pairs of New York varietals along with a pair from Prince Edwards. Very fresh, and a good mix of salinity and sweetness. \n\nThe serving team progressed the meal with an Amuse Bouche of Albacore poke.\n\nJohn Dory was served with a Corn Succotash, and was pan fried with a hint of heat. The Lobster was well cooked, stuffed with blue crab and stuffing mix. The claw was de-shelled and placed on the open body. The filet was about seven ounces and cooked to rare. Typical red wine reduction, but perfectly executed.\n\nThe dessert was an event in itself. The Butterscotch bread pudding was the best bread pudding I have had. Not terribly sweet, well balanced and huge portion.\n\nThe meal ended with a small chocolate cookie and gingerbread latte courtesy of the restaurant. \n\nOverall, great pacing and food.

This is definitely one of the places to check out along a strip full of what I would otherwise consider sensory overload.  They have a private dining area sectioned off by a glass wall so it looks like diners are sitting inside a fish tank, which I thought was very cool. The atmosphere was relaxing and service proved that dining here was worth every penny.\n\nHighlights off the dinner menu include jumbo lump crab cakes served over a bed of market vegetable relish and citrus aioli; seared fennel dusted ahi tuna; an upscale rendition of S'mores (yes ... but cleaner and no melty marshmallows all over your hands), ultra-smooth vanilla creme brulee, and a tasty, though not tart enough, lychee sorbet."

The hostess proceeded to sit us at a table of 6 for our party of 5.  Seeing that there were 5 settings, but 6 chairs, the gorgeous hostess reamed the help to \"get their act together\".  Hot and bitchy, now that's my kind of girl.\n\nThe food was decent for the most part.  Had the Seafood Plateau to start which had fresh items from the raw bar.  My entree was the fish soup, which was sort of a spin on the classic cioppino.  My friends had the scallops which were delicious.  The bill was not cheap, but not outrageous.  This place is on par with most decent seafood joints in Vegas."

I had my standard Captain and Coke and ordered some Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and a Sea Scallop dinner.  The shrimp cocktail was good but pricey.   Four large shrimps for $18.   The sea scallop dinner was $35 for four HUGE scallops.  They were served on top of a sweet potato puree and mushrooms.  The scallops were very good but not the best I've had.  \n\nI was almost done with my Captain and Coke when the bartender accidentally refilled the whole thing with Coke.  He realized his mistake immediately and gave me another free drink.   As he pushed it toward me, one of the drinks spilled onto the pants and shoes of the man sitting next to me.  He gave him a free drink and appetizer which was nice.  \n\nI really liked the atmosphere and would come back again.  I would recommend giving it a try."

            "review": "Man, I so wanted to like this restaurant.  I really did.  I needed an awesome seafood restaurant within the Venetian.  Instead I found it being rather mediocre... average at best, with some things being good and others being weak-to-bad.  And this is on two occasions to visit.\n\nMENU OVERHYPE\nI remember when I got to look at the menu for the first time, I licked my chops because the dishes looked fantastic.  For a seafood nut like myself, this looked like it was going to be heaven-on-earth.  But very consistently, the dishes were a disappointment.  It's as if the marketing hype of the menu was simply too hard for the kitchen to match.\n\nALL ABOUT SEAFOOD\nI gave them a fair shot however.  When in a seafood restaurant, eat the seafood.  So I ignored the chicken & beef dishes and concentrated on the fish & crustaceans.  (Note these are dishes order over two dinners on two separate days)\n-- Seafood Trio:  3/5 --- Mixed bag\n-- Lobster Bisque:  2/5 --- Borderline Campbell's-worthy\n-- Ahi Sashimi & Tartar:  3/5 --- Tuna was clearly refrigerated for a while\n-- Crab stuffed lobster:  4/5 --- The only good thing during the dinner\n-- Grilled Jumbo Prawns:  2/5 --- Lukewarm meat\n-- Coconut Jumbo Prawns:  2/5  --- (Chef Special) WAY over-battered, more bread & coconut than shrimp\n-- Alaskan King Crab Legs:  2/5   --- (Chef Special) Cold!  Unintentionally.  Sent this back to get reheated.\n\nCOLD FOOD?\nUnfortunately, my feedback on virtually all the dishes that we were served was that either the dish was bland or it was straight served disturbingly luke warm.  Part of this could have to do with the fact that the service was consistently slow during both my visits.  I had to lasso a waiter during each visit - during a slow time during the day, mind you - to check on my wife's & my dishes.\n\nWELL... IT'S EDIBLE, I GUESS:\nUltimately, however I'm not sure that it mattered.  I never found myself savoring any of the bites I ate.  I never found myself going, \"Mmm... that was goooood.\"  I never thought, \"Where's that menu at?  I think I'd like to try something else on my next trip!\"  No, I pretty much toward the end of the meal conceded, \"I'm not into really anything that's been served.  At all.\"  That must be a record.  Usually at least one thing really stands out, and gets my juices flowing.  But not here.\n...The exterior of this restaurant is very attractive and with all the water imagery, I would think it would drag in a pretty good customer base so I have to believe that it'll last a while no matter how weak the cuisine is.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThis isn't a place I'm going to go back to, no matter how pretty or convenient it is for being at the Venetian.  I value my dinners too much to put up with mediocre food.  For this kind of money, I still say that Rosewood Grille has the best lobster & crab.\n\n2-Stars."

Our main courses were so delicious, we had to conquer them- despite how full we were from the previous courses. I got the John Dory which was server recommended & I am so happy I listened. Very versatile piece of fish; crunchy, savory, sweet. It was served over a lobster succatash, who doesn't like their food being served over lobster?! Last, but certainly not least- DESSERT!

AquaKnox was the first place we came to, and we decided to just hop in and give it a shot. Wow. Could be the best restaurant we ate at the entire trip.\nWe were informed it would be about 5 minutes for our table to be ready, as it was pretty full, so we were sat at the bar. We were immediately helped by the bartender, and I ordered a sweet tea vodka / lemonade drink which was absolutely spectacular. The bartender was very friendly and gave us some tips on where else to eat and drink in the area, and after a few minutes we were seated at our table.\nLove the atmosphere of the restaurant. Blue lights and blue drapes surround everything, giving it a very \"Aqua\" feeling, light music playing, and although the majority of people were dressed very well, the place had an upscale, but very relaxed atmosphere.\nOur server was spectacular. Very professional and courteous, attentive, and took care of all our needs. The appetizers were unbelievable- love the smoked salmon puree given to you at the start of the meal. I had a seared tuna plate with cous cous for a main meal- un-f'n-believable. Could possibly be the greatest tasting food I've ever had. So fresh and tasty, it was perfect. There were lots of different choices as far as main course meals- you can definitely find something to eat as long as you're into seafood, that's for sure.\nOverall, VERY glad we stopped into this place to eat, it definitely set the tone for the AWESOME Vegas trip we were about to have. Fantastic food, fantastic service, fantastic setting, it doesn't get any better than this. If you're staying in the Venetian / Palazzo, make sure you stop here. If you're on the strip and looking for good seafood, make a point to stop in and eat. Definitely one of the best, and I WILL be back."

Imagine a tasting for every dish. My party of 3 enjoyed this ridiculous tasting of 9 gourmet ice cream flavors in its own. Some of which were the traditional, vanilla bean and mango passion, and then the untraditional- Thai iced tea, guiness, lychee, butterscotch. Chef from kitchen had fun by allowing us to guess flavors, and later coming out at the end to see what we came up with.\n\n4th of all, for the steak lovers,\nGlazed with green peppercorn sauce, the Prime ribeye(calf), folded to be seasoned inside and out. seared filet style for texture and juiciness sprinkled with Saba beans and baby carrots on a bed of potato corn pur\u00e9e.

Recent trip, noticed service is still attentive, atmosphere is still nice; food has gone one step backward.\n\nHad my usual lobster stuffed with crab meat; lobster much smaller than times past and price higher than times past.  Also had lobster bisque; it was just ok this time compared to times past.  This would have been my sixth or seventh time here in last few years, ordering the same; so I could compare to my previous experiences.\n\nBetter places for seafood in vegas with better prices!"

I love the little seating arrangement that they have inside the tubed tower of wine they display towards the front.  I ordered a scallop dish with risotto.  The risotto was delicious but the scallops were over seasoned.  \n\nI also tried some mussels which were delicious and fresh.  They served it with a tiny baby bottle of Tabasco sauce that I thought was very cute."

My mom and I ended up eating here only because Tao had a long wait, were were doing Bouchon the next night, and nothing else, besides the random food court junk, was open in the Venetian at 10pm.  \r\n\r\nWe shared the steak salad, the lobster bisque, and the pommes frites.  Everything was surprisingly incredible.  The bisque was probably the best I've had--not too creamy with bites of lobster that melt in your mouth.  The steak salad was delicious, and had more meat on it than I expected.  The dressing was perfect (though it's exact flavors escape me now).   The frites, while good, didn't come with any dipping sauce.  They weren't so spectacular that they could stand on their own so I would have liked a nice aioli or something.  \r\n\r\nI wouldn't make a point of going back, but for a late night dining option at the Venetian, it was a good find."

Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and shown to our own private dining room with a single table for 6.  Immediately, they asked us if the music volume was ok and promptly lowered the volume to accommodate our enthusiastic conversations.  The inner decor was marine life focused with a tranquil and peaceful spa-like vibe, which greatly entertained our party, as one of the ladies is an avid diver.  \n\nThe first course consisted of a choice of the following delights: \n1) Lobster Bisque with Maine Lobster, Caviar, Creme Fraiche \n2) Crab Cakes with Marinated Vegetable Relish, Citrus Aioli, Petite Mache \n3) Halloumi & Watermelon with Shishito Peppers, Basalmic Vinegar \n4) Romaine Hearts & Treviso Pt. Reyes Blue Cheese Caesar\n\nI opted for the crab cakes, which were excellent!  The citrus aioli totally made the dish.  I tasted the lobster bisque, which was also delish with delicate, but oh so rich creme fraiche.  The real winner of course #1 took me by surprise; the halloumi & watermelon salad.  Boyfriend ordered it because he is allergia a los mariscos (I know you all remember that phrase from Spanish 101 practice work!)  Back to the story, being the goat cheese-aholic that I am, I would have ordered this dish if I understood what halloumi was.  I will never make that mistake again!  Hailing from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus,  halloumi is a semi-hard, unripened brined cheese made from a mixture of goat and sheep milk, and sometimes also cow milk.  It has a high melting point, and often fried or grilled, with a strong savory bite, with a slightly creamy texture.  Mmmm mmmm gewd!\n\nBefore course #2 arrived, the manager spoiled our party with a 3 special treats, which he explained were some of his absolute favorite things on the menu.  \n1) Smoked king salmon with pickled vegetables and buttery crunchy toasts  \n2) NY littleneck clams with garlic & chili in white wine herb butter \n3) Hollander mussels in chardonnay herb butter broth.  \nHonestly, this free little treat might have been the absolute best dishes to grace our table.  We were all politely sharing, but fighting our animal instinct to greedily ravage these dishes and lick the bottom of the bowls clean!\n\nThe second course consisted of a choice of the following indulgences:\n1) Pacific White Prawns with Pearl Couscous, Lobster Cream, Cherry Tomatoes, Scampi Garlic Butter \n2) Prime Ribcap Steak Frites with Roasted Shallot Red Wine Glaze \n3) Mt. Cook Alpine King Salmon with Vegetable Ragout, Buerre Blanc \n4) Roasted Jidori Chicken - Celeriac Puree, Glazed Baby Carrots, Sauce Ver Jus\nThe whole party's orders were split between the prawns and the steak.  My only complaint is that I was torn between the salmon and prawns.  Having a less than stellar salmon experience the previous night led me to try the prawns.  All of the steaks were cooked to perfection.\n\nThe third course consisted of a choice of these treats:\nVanilla Bean Creme Brulee or Homemade Ice Cream Sundae\nI think the entire table ordered and enjoyed the creme brulee, which was as delicious as it was beautiful.\n\nI will be back.  Thank you for an evening of culinary bliss and thoughtful service Aquaknox!"

The seafood appetizer was pretty good. Filled with 4 different clams, oyster shooters, ceviche, jumbo shrimp cocktails, crab claws, lobster....Um you could probably stop here b/c by the end of this I was pretty stuffed. We then had lobster bisque which was SOOOO FRIGGING good. Decadently creamy (mmmmm BUTTTER, FAT, LARD, whatever it was so rich) So tasty with small chunks of lobsters - FAVORITE!\n\nI only tried two of the dishes ordered: Surf 'n' Turf and Wild Halibut. The halibut was good but not out of this world. At this point I was really stuffed so stomach realestate was becoming scarce and more selective. The surf 'n' turf was too salty (crab stuffed lobster) the filet was good but not the best I'd ever had.\n\nOverall, come eat the seafood appetizer and lobster bisque drink some wine...you'll be stuffed. You can skip the entrees."

Everything was incredibly salty and had a fishy after taste. It made us think they over-salted everything to mask the poor quality and freshness of the seafood.

They ended up comping us on the inedible items, which was nice... but definitely won't be coming back."

It was hard to get someone's attention to grab the bill and also just for a water refill. \n\nAlso whoever cleared the oyster tray from our table spilled the leftover water all over one of the guys at the table and also into his glass of wine so he couldn't even finish it. We didn't even get an apology or something to wipe up the spill. \n\nFor the price we spent for dinner (we were a party of 9 so the bill came to about $700) we received poor service."

Everyone was very polite and cheerful, although we were probably one of the last parties of the night. \n\nFor appetizer, we shared the clams. THEY WERE THE BEST PART OF DINNER. The clams were cooked just how I like them and the broth it comes in is \"to die for\". Don't forget to ask for extra bread for the broth, trust me you'll want it. I ordered the barramundi, and I must say that it was cooked to perfection. The potato puree was super smooth and tasted awesome with the light dressing on it. My boyfriend ordered some sort of shrimp dish, and he said that he liked it. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful.\n\nWe decided on not ordering dessert because we were too full, but they brought us a complimentary one anyway. They served us \"adult milk and cookies\". it came with a small fresh baked cookie and a shot glass filled with what I think was a mixture of milk, sugar, cinnamon, and rum. It was super yummy and was just the right sweetness.\n\nAll together I believe our bill was just over $90 for the two of us. \n\nI had a great experience at AquaKnox, but the reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the placement of the restaurant. It is placed in an open area where you can hear all the hustle and bustle of the slot machines and night clubs, and the only thing that would have made that dinner absolutely perfect was if the restaurant was more secluded and romantic. Other than that, I have no complaints."

He is a great server and made our time so much more enjoyable.  We had him the first time (two nights prior), and he remembered us. He wasn't overbearing, but made sure we were taken care of like VIPs. Even the manager recognized us! He arranged for us to get a special appetizer from Sous Chef James, who we later got to meet so we could personally compliment him. He earned it. \n\nThis time around we dined on a crab cocktail, lobster bisque, delicious yellowtail sashimi, salmon for me, prawns for the BF, lobster mash potatoes (you can have them separate from the halibut dish!!!), pomegranate mojitos, and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert.

Nice ambience and very friendly and attentive service - but a very expensive place - as we have expected for s restaurant in The Venetian. I started the classic way with the Lobster Bisque Soup - it was superb. My colleague had the Greenlip Mussels  - when you have been to New Zealand you know them very well - they are bigger than the PEI mussels and the shells shimmer somehow green. As a main I had the Barramundi from down under. Just a great fish unfortunately you can't get it very often in the US. I closed my meal with a cheese plate. Overall food an service was great a real good seafood place - definitely worth the price and also for revisiting."

Most of my friends ordered the scallops and a few had other fishes.\n\nThe foie gras was quite strange. It was very tough and gamey. They should just take that one off the menu. The mussels were pretty good. A good size and the thai sauce and rice were done well.\n\nMy friends had no complaints about the scallops or fish but said it was nothing spectaulor for the price. They more had complaints about feeling rushed. Our server and the busboys were a little too pushy with trying to remove plates and bring the check. This is a nice restaurant that is practically empty, why rush us out?"

There were five of us.  3 of my friends got the Surf and Turf ( ribeye steak & lobster),  my other girlfriend had crab stuffed lobster, and I had the lobster bisque soup, and  Day Boat Scallops. \nFollow by few of their dessert plate.

We never once had to ask for anything...  \nHere are the Cons.... \nWe had a very hard time with their wine list... For the quality of food and being an upscale restaurant their wine list was mediocre...  We started off with ZD Reserve, which was an okay wine... But I can get that from BevMo for $45.00... Our second bottle was 2002 Far Niente which was better then ZD but still weren't very impressed.  \nAnother thing, the lobster was bit tough... We had hard time cutting the meat so one of the wait staff ended up cutting out the meat for us...  \nLast thing, which is no big deal, but they ran out of Beluga caviar so they had to run to next door to get lower grade caviar...  :(  \nIf they had a better wine list, and we didn't have any issue with the lobster I would have given them 5 stars...   Also, it is bit pricey...  Our bill came out to $1,550.00 for party of 5...  Then again we felt that we deserve a good food now and then.... So it was worth it!!!!"

Service throughout continued to be excellent, even after we found out that they were closing in just a few minutes.\n\nI was in the mood for scallops, but after the waiter's incredibly convincing description of the shellfish platter, we opted for that as an appetizer, as well.  It was amazing... and this is coming from someone formerly (and still a little bit) afraid of removing the exoskeleton of crustaceans. He gave us an extra oyster shooter, too, since there were three of us and the platter was only designed for two. The bottle of red wine he suggested (I don't remember what it was, I was too enraptured with the seafood platter) went perfectly with the meal, too. I still ordered the scallops and, while I remember them being tasty (and they left out the bacon in the polenta on my plate), that seafood platter won the meal for me.\n\nAnd for my trip to Vegas."

Flavors were melt in your mouth awesome! For the entree we all had the salmon. Two of us had it blackened. I have to say it was the most flavorful and memorable salmon dish I have ever had. Seasoning was spot on. The salmon was served on top of something called black forbidden rice which was bursting with flavors I can't even put into words. Awesome! They brought out some complimentary cheese appetizers and tuna tartar with wasabi cream sauce which were wonderful. \n\nFor desert we had the bread pudding which was superb. Hot out of the oven with vanilla bean ice cream on the side. They also served us some complimentary champagne which was very nice of them. All in all it was a five star experience. Highly recommended."

I was really underwhelmed by the food- I'd give it a 2. Bread service was overly toasted ciabatta slices with bland butter. We ordered the oysters and shrimp cocktail to start. Just average. For dinner we got the wild Coho salmon. It was not only over cooked and dry but very very salty. I did not want to spoil the mood so I ate it. The filet mignon then came rare when we had ordered it medium. Again I ate it but they did redo my husbands portion. The mashed potatoes it came with were cold. The restaurant was not that busy. Maybe we would have fared better with the crab or lobster but I expected more from the fish dish. Like I said I cannot complain about the service- it was excellent."

The service was attentive and friendly, hence, the three stars.  The food was not impressive.  For starter,  the seafood was not fresh.  I had the AquaKnox plateau and their crab claws tasted frozen that have been thawed out prior to opening.  Additionally,  the claws were not open/ cracked properly so I had difficulty getting to the crab meat.  They did not provide any utensil to de-shell the seafood.  Second,  the shrimp ceviche was bland. No flavor.  It was not worth $79. Third, the $53 AquaKnox fish soup was \"meh\". Average. My mom makes an amazing cioppino soup that'll knock your socks off compared to their fish soup.\n\nMy visit was a disappointment. I will not be back to AquaKnox unless they serve the fish soup with a golden spoon. \n\nEdited - Almost forgot about the dessert! It was the best part of the meal.  Apple pie donuts with vanilla ice cream was delicious. The minced apples inside each donuts made the dessert unforgettable. If you do decide to eat here,  be sure to save room for dessert as it's better than the main course."

I would suggest that and a variety of oysters from the raw bar. \n\nWhat I did not like was that the server was more concerned about 'selling' than my food interests. Upon ordering a significantly priced bottle of wine, he came back with a more expensive proprietary label bottle saying that I would probably like that better. Actually, I know my wine and ordered specifically to pair with my meal/my group's meal. When I asked why & what specific vineyard this wine came from- I stumped him into a babbling tangent with no specific answer.\n\nIn addition, they were really big on pushing their $80 seafood appetizer sampler. We were told that we should order that...\"it's best for a table of four like this\". Really? We more than happily ordered ~ $100 in appetizers but, did not see the value in the mish-mash of items on the sampler.\n\nBottom line, great food. Order what you want and you will not be disappointed."

ARGH!!!!  \n\nAnd WE had to give him ideas on how to alleviate HIS mistake.  He screwed up, he should fix it, and COMP something.  He suggested that we skip the course, b/c even if we heated our main courses it would compromise the quality.  OKAY....but we still want our damn salads, it takes FIVE minutes to throw a salad together, and we already waited FIVE minutes for him to notice that we didn't touch our food.  \n\nOur main courses were already lukewarm.  God.  RECOGINIZE foolio.  \n\nHence, to save his dumb ass, he was on top of things for the rest of the meal, to the point of annoying.  I hate that.  \n\nFREEBIE: Breadsticks, super yum, they were dusted with black pepper and the dip was smoked salmon pate.  FAB.  \n\nThings to order: \nScallops, very good, they were HUMONGOUS!!!  The combined net weight was probably more than a 10 ounce steak.  Meaty, tender & flavorful.  \n\nTo skip:\n-Trio was alright, not delicate, the sauces covered up the crab, tuna, and lobster flavors.  The lobster was rubbery.\n-Red snapper, bland, and tough.  DRY.  \n\nWas the wait for the salads worth it?  Not really.  It was the Caesar and the Bibb...\n\nThe last FREEBIE.  Mmmm...they were little triangles of brownie bites with chocolate rice crisps.  So save your $$$ and don't order dessert.\n\nWe were sat in the center of the restaurant against the railing, ask for a booth, overall the ambiance was better than most of the restaurants in the Venetian and the Palazzo."

Thanks to Opentable as my sister booked through them and we both had never heard of the restaurant before.\n\nService - considerate & attentive, but not smothering. There were a few people attending to the table and I didn't have any issues. We had everything we needed and there was constant follow-up throughout the meal.\n\nFood -  a seafood lover's heaven! They even have caviar. Stand out entrees were the fish soup with large portions of shellfish and a spicy broth; and the cashew crusted tuna. I am used to the standard pepper ahi tuna, so this dish was a unique, crunchier version of one of my fav fishes. \n* Save room because the desserts are just as memorable. The bread pudding is a popular one, but for something lighter I would recommend the orange champagne semi-freddo. Delish! \n\nAtmosphere - sea of blues & whites. An immaculate setting. The restroom was also immaculate. \n* My only gripe was that some of the tables are a little close together.\n\nOverall, Aquaknox was a great dining experience.

We were initially skeptical about it because it's a \"quiet\" restaurant, but they were actually very welcoming and accommodated us just fine.\n\nOur server Jesse came, and he's easily one of the best servers we have seen.  He's very nice, humorous, and most importantly clear in explaining the menu.  Another thing we love about him was that he always checked on us at the right time, not so often that it became annoying, but at the same time whenever we needed something, he was right there.\n\nWe ordered the smoked fish trio appetizer, it was very light and fresh.  It was a very fun dish and we enjoyed it a lot.  We also ordered a lobster bisque, and Jesse was great in splitting the soup for us.  We often find lobster bisque from other restaurants on the salty / strong side, but to our surprise Aquaknox got it perfect.  A lot of lobster flavor, silky smooth, and very very creamy.  We loved it.\n\nAlso worth it to mention about the bread sticks wit that smoky salmon butter.  It's so good and specially, very different from the breads that we have tasted in other restaurants.\n\nMy wife ordered the red snapper, it was very moist and light.  With all the vege on top, mashed potato at the bottom, and also the lightly citrus sauce, it was a great combination.\n\nI ordered the crab meat stuffed lobster, and it's simply awesome.  The portion was no joke at all, the claws were bigger than my hand!!!!!!!  I have had a lot of lobster in my life, but these were done spot on.  It's very tender, but you still get the lobster texture.  My wife is not a big lobster lover but she was truly amazed at the few bites she tried.  It's very moist with that citrus and smoky flavor.  The stuffing was also heavenly.  Basically the whole dish was nothing short of WOW.\n\nWe also ordered a side dish of sauteed spinach, it's very fresh and also done very well.\n\nThe overall experience was a total A+, we were so surprised.  Of course, price is definitely on the high side, but for the quality of the food and also the kind of services we received, I think it was well worth the money.\n\nAnd I am sure my 1 year old daughter would agree too.  She tasted every single dish that evening and she ate A LOT.  Yup, talk about one expensive dinner for a kid!!!"

I felt like if I had read that there was going to be cheese in the couscous, I would never have ordered it. I don't know whose bright idea it is/was to put cheese with seafood, but it is by far one of the most disgusting combinations in my book. Having said that, I didn't eat the couscous. Understand that all that's left is the shrimp. Which were HUGE, but also not mind blowing as far as texture and taste. Maybe it would taste better with cheese? Maybe not. \n\nI had a taste of the crab stuffed lobster tail and well. It's lobster. It's good. The crab stuffing though...salty with...too much. Like. Why waste crab if you can't taste it? Also, beware \"market price\". Just saying. It was 100% not worth it. Even if it was lobster.\n\nThe meal was wrapped up with a complimentary...dessert? Pallette cleanser?

I don't like the fact that if you bring your own bottle of champagne they put it in the back for you at all times, don't offer you a chiller for it. I was allowed a bottle of Crystal and I assumed it would be placed in a bucket of ice beside my table at the time of my meal like I have seen with the one that are placed on an ice bucket with a holder next to the table. My bottle of Crystal was kept in the back, and it pissed me off when I told the waiter you should try this vintage, it's awesome. He told me I already tried some of yours in the back. I was really pissed, but dinner was comp'd because I gamble a lot. The food is well presented and the quality is of the highest. On one occasion when I was having clams, I got a mouth full of sand and it was disgusting."

We made the reservations Saturday afternoon and they were able to accomodate us, for that night, so I was hesitant about this place.  Labor day weekend, Saturday night, and not booked? what gives? \n\nWell I was pleasantly surprised.  The place is unassuming from outside (located in the Venetian) but inside is tastefully decorated.  I loved all the soothing blue colors they used throughout. \n\nWe were seated promptly and our server was stellar.  You could tell he was experienced and swiftly took our drink orders.  I heard him make some suggestions for wine as well as signature dishes to try.  \n\nI decided to splurge on myself and ordered the crab stuffed lobster.  Now I've had lobster at chain restaurants, as well as fine dining establishments, but the lobster they brought out was the biggest I'd ever seen.  It was sliced in half exposing all of the wonderful meat, crab stuffing and served with drawn butter.  It was pure indulgence.  \n\nThe lobster was tender and sweet and the crab stuffing was savory and flavored well.  And then, dunking it all into the melted butter! It  was  too much for my taste buds! Needless to say, I was glad I decided to splurge because it was a well spent $70.  Oh yeah, there were vegetables served on the side, but clearly the lobster was the star.  \n\nI did hear a few comments about the roasted chicken being too salty but overall, I think everyone else enjoyed their meals.  Honestly, I was too busy enjoying my lobster to even care."

My sole criteria were: non-steak, seafood preferred, on the strip, reservation availability on opentable, and of course, positive yelp reviews.  \n\nFirst off, the place did not look as impressive as I'd hoped.  My expectations were probably too high.  In the dining area, there wasn't any cool watery dcor, because that's only in the bar area.  We were seated somewhere in the middle of the room, and it felt very cramped, like all the tables were too close.  For one thing, the chairs were huge (although comfortable) taking up a lot of space, difficult to get in and out and move around.  Service wasn't as smooth as I expected, nor comfortable or inviting.  \n\nFor appetizers, I ordered lobster bisque for myself and crab cakes for the table.  I don't understand the hype about lobster bisque.  It was creamy, has the essence of lobster, little chunks of lobster, and so it hit all the right marks, but didn't amaze me.  Maybe three days of lobster had something to do with it as well.  The crab cakes were also perfectly done, but not above and beyond.  I think I'm also jaded with an overabundance of crab cakes in my diet.  For the main, I ordered the John Dory.  I loved the lobster succotash, although a little bit sweet.  Tasting around the table, there were scallops, jumbo prawns, and ahi tuna.  Everything was perfectly cooked, and each had very different, yet interesting sides.  The prawns were probably the largest I had ever seen.  The tuna was a turn off because of its overly strong tapenade topping.  \n\nFor dessert we had the crme brulee and sticky toffee pudding.  I scoffed at the brulee - I could make a better one at home.  It was too soft when served.  I enjoyed the toffee, since it was the first one I ever had.  The coffee came with chocolate almond biscotti, which I appreciated.\n\nIf you're watching Blue Man, it's a toss up between this and Delmonico's next door.\n\nIn the end, I just felt guilty for all the fresh fish having been flown in to Vegas.  This is the desert!  I'll stick to seafood in San Francisco."

I'm from Hawaii and we have the one of the best seafood dishes here, however this restaurant (and awesome chef) truly created a beautiful and orgasimic-euphoric dish. \n\nPROS:\n1. Surf and turf. The stuffed lobster was perfect! I rarely eat steak because it doesn't taste appealing. BUT this was so amazing and I understood why people love steak! Haha. \n\n2. The seafood stew-cipionnio was the best ever broth. The seafood was bountiful and tender. I ordered it without the couscous. \n\n3. Most of all, the server was personable, but professional. He was so accommodating and respected our space as we took our time, laughed, and enjoyed the whole experience. The waters were always filled. The wait staff was smiling, friendly, and very attentive. \n\n4. Make a reservation for around 5:30pm. Why? Most kitchens are ready and eager to start cooking. Anytime after 6:30pm, usually kitchens are slammed. The noise level was quiet and we weren't rushed. \n\nYou will enJOY your experience! I'm definitely coming back here when I visit Vegas!"

Let me say it again....\n\nSWEET SHRIMP & CRAB SALAD!  \n\nI've asked the servers what their dressing is and I couldn't quite get it out of him.  Nonetheless I'm going to try to replicate.  Its a misture of sesame oil, olive oil and a blend of citrus fruits (lime, lemon??).  \n\nThe prices aren't cheap.  That salad is 18 dollars.  Pretty high up there.  I've talked to others and some think they could charge 25-28 dollars for that salad and they would still buy it.  Most of the main courses are in the 30+ range.

My wife didn't want an appetizer, when we ordered there was some joking about me sharing my crab cake with her, waiter said he would bring an extra plate for her. Appetizer came out on two plates, two small crab cakes. Not sure if that is what I would have gotten  if I just said no to sharing. Anyway, bill came, charged an extra $4 for the privilege of sharing with my wife. What a rip-off. $22 for two bite sized crab cakes.\n\nFor dinner , I got the lobster with crab, when I was ordering I asked waiter if I got to choose the size or it just came as they had it. Was told I didn't get to choose the size, but it would be about 2 lbs. Lobster was maybe 1 1/4 tops. I get them from the market at home all the time, no way in hell that lobster was 2 lbs. $81 to boot, another rip-off.\n\nPenny wise pound foolish strategy by this restaurant, meal was around $250, ripping us off for $4 and lying about the size of the lobster is not a good way to get people to come back and generates negative press for your restaurant. It taints the hotel also, would think twice about staying at the Venetian again now as I don't like being ripped off. Too many other hotel and restaurant choices in Vegas."

We started with the House Smoked Fish Plate (absolutely sublime) and the Seafood Trio appetizers (sweet shrimp, lobster and jumbo crab cocktails all with their own special sauces - YUM!!). Frickin amazing. Both of them. \n\nWe moved on to the beet salad with horseradish vinaigrette and then I ordered the mesquite grilled Wild King Salmon and she ordered the sauteed John Dory with Lobster Succotash and Sweet Corn Broth. The salmon and the john dory were both cooked perfectly - medium rare, the sauces wonderful. As often happens, I liked her dish even better than mine! \n\nWe ordered two desserts and only liked one of them, but that's because my friend doesn't like mousse and i don't like that kind of rich semisweet chocolate enough to have really  enjoyed the dessert. But the peach crumble dessert was awesome! \n\nThe only reason why I am giving them 4 stars and not 5 is because the waiter seemed to have a great deal of trouble getting us a dry white wine to go with our meal. We tried one tasting at his suggestion and it was way too fruity and so we opted for another one he suggested, a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, which (1) took too long to get to our table (there was some problem, and we had already gone through 1/2 our appetizers by the time it showed up at our table) and (2) was NOT DRY! it wasn't overly sweet but it certainly was not dry as we had asked. \n\nBut by the 2nd glass it didn't matter and the frickin food was sooo goshdarn delicious that I still walked away happy as, well, a clam."

She always orders scallops if they are on the menu. She said they were perfectly cooked and the accompanying sides were as tasty as those she had at Roy's and the SW Steakhouse in the Wynn.   \n\nThe Bad\nTwo stars for ambiance - They crammed as many tables and chairs into the space as possible. I am not a large person and I barely had enough room to move my chair back to get in and out. The tables and chairs on each side of the walkways to allow diners into and out of the restaurant and the wait staff room to get around the restaurant were very close to each other. I could have easily leaned over and touch the chair next to me across the walkway. The music was too loud for a fine dining restaurant.\n\nTwo stars for my dinner. I had the AquaKnox Fish Soup. The John Dory was overcooked, one of the clams and one of the oysters were no bigger than the nail on my little finger and the lobster was overcooked and very tiny. I have had perfectly cooked and a much larger lobster tails in a similar dish at Roy's and even Red Lobster! A real shame because the broth was to die for.\n\nTwo stars for menu variety and creativity - I had a very difficult time finding a starter to go with my Fish Soup. Almost every starter contained some element in the Fish Soup so I just ordered the boring Romaine Salad and my wife did the same. The menu is uninspired and insipid. The appetizer \"Special\" was steamed crab legs with drawn butter. I wonder how long it took them to develop that dish! Anyone can buy crab legs from the grocery store, warm them and melt butter on the side. When we go out to eat in a fine dining restaurant we expect the only problem with the menu to be too many interesting and enticing choices, not too few! Check out the online menus for the Chart House and Roy's, both upscale seafood restaurants also in Las Vegas, for examples of truly inspired and creative offerings.\n\nThe Bottom Line\nTwo stars for a disappointing experience and a case of \"Buyer's and Eater's Remorse\"! If you are a local in Las Vegas, much better choices are The Chart House in the Golden Nugget and Roy's - a short eight minute drive to Flamingo Road from the Venetian. Either restaurant has far more convenient valet or self parking.   If you are from out of town and without a car, the extra expense for a cab ride to either restaurant is advised."

So good that I pity the poor bastard who has never savored the unique culinary delight that a goose so generously gave its life for.\n\nWe also split a lobster tail, which was superb, served with drawn butter, grilled lemon, and two tasty spears of asparagus for each of us.

This was our second time dining at this restaurant.  The first time was okay but overpriced.  We ordered a dozen oysters at the bar.  The oysters came out quickly and my husband was about to eat the first when both of us noted something black squirming in the oyster.  Upon closer inspection it was a black worm about a centimeter long.  It was moving very quickly so we called over the bartender to show him.  He did see it and took the oyster and quickly threw it away and left the rest of the oysters.  We let him know that we did not want the rest of the oysters and he then took them away.  He left the bar area for a few minutes (probably to let someone know what happened).  Upon his return, no apology, just asked if we wanted something else.  We didn't.  It probably took us about 15 minutes to finish our drinks.  During that time no apology from anyone at the restaurant.  On our way out I asked to see the manager to let him know what happened and he smiled and said he already knew.  We let him know that we at least expected an apology and he said that the bartender should have apologized.  He went over to the bartender and said something to him.  The bartender got irate and said first to us \"what do you want me to do, I didn't charge you for the oysters\".  He then said to his manager that he apologized 3 times.  A complete fabrication.  Not sure if I'm eating raw oysters anymore, but what I can say is that we will never return to AquaKnox."

            "review": "I went to Las Vegas for the weekend and I was craving for a good seafood restaurant.  I'm glad I chose Aquaknox. I enjoyed the decor of the restaurant with its underwater-like environment. I also saw the owner chef, Tom Moloney, walking around the dining room every once in a while. I think it was kinda refreshing considering not many of the owner celeb chefs work in their kitchens anymore. \n\nFor my meal I chose the crab cake, lobster bisque, pan-seared grouper, and the interpretation on s'mores with peanut butter ice cream. There was an amuse of peppery bread sticks and smoked trout dip. Nothing too special but something nice to snack on at the beginning of the meal. The crab cake was good but since it was labeled \"jumbo lump\" you would actually see lump crab meat. I mean it was nothing but crab but the integrity of the lump was gone in the making of it. The lobster bisque itself was of total lobster essence with a few nuggets of lobster meat and a dollop of creme fraiche and caviar. The lobster was slightly chewy but, what the hell, it's lobster so I ate it with great gratification. The grouper was delicious as it was sitting on top of a bed of soba noodles, baby bok choy, and little shiitake mushrooms and all surrounded in a sea of lobster broth. The glaze on the grouper was sweet and a bite of spice from the sriracha in the glaze. Finally, the \"s'mores\" dessert was a chocolate mousse with graham cracker cookie bottom surrounded by milk chocolate and topped with marshamallow and accompanied with a small scoop of peanut butter ice cream. Very satisfying and a nice ending to a great meal.\n\nService I must say was very attentive, especially by the secondary waiter. The primary waiter who took my order was nice but was rarely seen after that. It looked like he was attending the bigger parties in his area. It was fine because the secondary waiter filled my water on time, asked me if I wanted a second helping of the smoked trout dip, asked if everything was OK with my meal, replaced my silverware at the appropriate times, and took my dessert order. So kudos to the secondary waiter.\n\nMy experience at Aquaknox was well worth it. I would definitely go back there if I had a craving for some great, fresh seafood with attentive service."

The Food was good possibly even very good but also very expensive - About a third overpriced compared to other similar locations.  The wine list also was quite expensive with not much under $100 a bottle (there were some though).  When a glass of wine costs 50% more then what you can get for an entire bottle at the local Walgreens - about 5X retail - Thats pricey (In my opinion wine should never be more then 2-3 X retail)  Finally, Service was good but again not great.  I don't mind paying more but as the cost goes up so do my expectations and they simply was not met."

In our case French Fries were substituted for Butternut Puree, Mushroom, and Brussels Sprouts.  \n\nFor another starter following on the heels of a tasty amuse bouche of Chicken Salad with Piquillo Peppers on Focaccia, Pacific Prawns with horseradish-based Atomic Cocktail Sauce served on the side packed a cold, meaty, and spicy payload.  And a difficult to find King Crab Louie salad with shaved vegetables, Heirloom Tomatoes, Baby Iceberg Heart, and Green Goddess Dressing added to the cool gustatory vibe before the mains were brought to our table.  \n\nThen we dined on excellent moist Roasted Welsh Seabass with Fingerling Potatoes and squash, and large New Bedford Scallops with hand-cut Kennebuck Fries.  Although we didn't order any dessert, we were each treated to a sweet Chocolate Hazelnut confection at meal's end.  \n\nThis is a place that takes pleasing its diners seriously.  Our server was solicitous of our needs, and I observed well-focused chefs working frenetically in the kitchen to quickly and correctly complete orders.   \n\nFor me, when craving fine fish, a return trip is quite likely!"

Valerie (private events from Aquaknox) contacted me right away and sold me on what Aquaknox had to offer.  I wanted to make this special for my bro-in-law who was being deployed.  Valerie was able to offer a special military discount of 15% off our total bill (awesome gesture) and recommended the wine tower to have our dinner.  She gave us multiple options for the tasting menu and I opted for the 5 course.  I read many reviews and was a little concern that it may be too little of food (4 dishes plus dessert), but boy was I wrong. Prior to our arrival date, Valerie kept in constant contact with me to go over the menu, menu design, and to just ensure that our dinner was going to be special.  This level of service continued on to the day of our event.\nWe arrived and was promptly escorted into the wine tower.  Since it was a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was not crowded, but I am still glad we decided on the Wine tower.  It made all feel special.  The tower itself is a tad chilly (but she had already warned me of that) but we were prepared.  There were people constantly serving us. Andrea was our captain for the evening, and was on top of everything and super friendly.  We started off we a toast (she recommended a sparkling wine over champagne to save us cost).  We had two non drinkers, so Min (assistant manager/mixologist) made them a really special drink (consisting of ginger beer and some other fruits).  They really really enjoyed it.  \nThe menu was printed on a card and got everyone excited.  We started off with oysters.  Great presentation and most importantly, great flavor.  Only small knock was that Andrea wasn't exactly sure which oysters were which (no big deal).  The first official course was a gazpacho.  This was the best that I have every had.  Very fresh and tasty.  The following 3 courses were duos of amazing stuff.  Crab cakes and Shrimp Salad.  The crab cakes were flavor full, but the shrimp salad was were it was at.  It consisted of 2 sweet shrimps, and a ton of lump crab meat.  This was topped off with micro greens.  Very very delicious.  Next was the fishes.  Barramundi/John Dory.  I was excited to try the John Dory.  But what made the dish was the lobster succotash below it.  Very nice dish.  The Barramundi was also very good with the mash potatoes.  We could have ended it there, but then came the surf and turf.  Filet was on point.  Perfectly cooked and nice flavor.  The prawns (2) were cooked on open flames and also had great flavor.  By now, we were totally stuffed and could barely consumed dessert (chocolate gelato/mousse combo).  Also throughout the evening, we kept asking Min to make us different cocktails.  He took pleasure in coming up with different things and explaining what he made.  I really appreciate all of his explanation and effort he put into it.  One of the girls asked about the ginger beer, he produced a new bottle and served us each a sample.  \nAll in all, service and food was spot on.  Aquaknox may not be the most famous restaurant in Vegas (or even in the Venetian), yet it should definitely not be overlooked.  I thought we got a great value (5 course turned into 9 courses) in the tasting menu.  Nothing was over the top but very tasty.  Flavors were not too complex for our simple palates.\nWill definitely return.  Thanks Valerie, Min, Andrea, and the rest of the staff for a memorable evening."

As we had wine as part of a \"happy hour event\" through the conference No1DP was attending, we talked to one of the line cooks about their menu and observed their open kitchen. Out of all the places we went to happy hour, this place impressed me enough to come back for dinner, so the No1DP promptly made dinner reservations later that night.\n\nCONCEPT/VENUE: The Venetian/Palazzo's fine dining option with an emphasis on \"global water cuisine\". Fancy schmancy way of saying upscale seafood. \n\nAt the entrance to the restaurant there is a water-encased walk-in wine cellar. We both thought that this would be a perfect way to showcase their premium wines as the wines themselves were \"hidden in plain sight\" by the waterfalls and enticing potential customers to come inside. As we went inside No1DP wondered how much it would take to eat inside the wine cellar as there was a table that could seat two. \n\nNo1DP and I were placed in the booth area where other couples were present. The booths provide a place to people-watch other diners in the tables while having a little area to ourselves. It was also easy for bussers and waiters to pass by without saying anything.\n \nSERVICE: Overall so-so. Service was good that silverware was replaced when a new dish was about to come out and that when you left your table, your napkin was remade for you. They were also quick to refill your wine glasses. The wait time between ordering our food and when the food actually came out was at least 20 minutes, and when the food finally came they gave No1DP the wrong dish, the Pacific Blue Prawns. We took a bite out of the prawns and thought it was good until No1DP realized that he ordered halibut. It took time to make another halibut and gave him a small salad for compensation as I ate my dish. No1DP liked his salad and the dressing. \n\nFOOD/DRINK\nWine was a low-oak Chardonnay, which was chosen because our dishes consisted of fish with hearty sauces. \n\nAmuse was a very small \"tuna salad\" of sorts with a mushroom on outside. Mushroom was firm and tuna was lightly seasoned.\n\nAppetizer was a wild blue crab cake ($18): Chayote slaw, creole remoulade sauce. Crab cake was done perfectly as the crab fell apart after slicing it. Remoulade gave the crab a bit of spice and the vegetable medley on top sweetened the dish. \n\nMy dish was a New Zealand john dory ($45): Lobster succotash, okra, wild mushrooms, sweet corn nage, black truffle. One of AquaKnox's signature dishes. The fish was soft, buttery and could easily be separated with a fork. Sauce was also delicious and went with the dish, made the fish a little more nutty. Sauce was heavy but not too heavy in that I could finish my dish. \n\nNo1DP's real dish was a wild Alaskan halibut ($44): Lobster mashed potatoes, broccolini, piquillo pepper relish. I'm used to softer halibut and was a little disappointed in the texture, especially since I started realizing that I prefer fish with soft textures. No1DP did enjoy his fish as he's used to this type of texture for halibut and thought the sauce was delicious as well. \n\nAside from the spotty service the No1DP and I enjoyed our experience here and I would recommend this place for fine dining/seafood if you want to stay in the Venetian area for dinner."

My group had never seen how \"I roll\" (Lol) They did NOT disappoint. There were 6 in our group, we had oysters on the half shell, my boss and I split the 2 lb lobster stuffed with crab (Amazing! )  Our non-seafood fans raved about their 14 ounce NY steak. Aquaknox remains my favorite restaurant of all time.  It is worth every cent to take part in the Aquaknox experience. Thank you to Managers Brian and Andrew for creating such a wonderful experience for us! If you're ever in Monterey, please let us return the favor :-) \nJ Nelson \nMassage Envy Monterey"

Almost every chef who is a 'somebody' has a place on the strip, so when we came to try Chef Molony's restaurant after a long day, my hopes were high.  Thankfully, he did not disappoint.  \n\nAmbiance + Service: love the feel of this restaurant and once you are a few steps in, you forget you are in Las Vegas (a big plus in my book).  Lovely textures, comfortable lighting and friendly, informative service set this evening off on the right food.\n\nWine List: Solid wine list, we opted to have a bottle recommended by our server.  Well chosen and moderately priced.\n\nApps: The Halloumi and Watermelon is awesome (worth sharing for sure) and the Butter Lettuce & Herb salad was stellar.  We were wistfully licking the plates as they left the table.\n\nMains:  All of the seafood selections were great, with the Wild Barramundi winning 'best dish' of the night.  The signature John Dory was also lovely and the prawns were delightful - and the heartiest dish.  That said, if you are only getting one dish: get the Barramundi.\n\nWe passed on dessert this time, but will definitely be coming back for more deliciousness next time I find myself in LV."

Each table adorned in white linen, and garnished with blue goblets & wine glasses. My boyfriend & I were celebrating an anniversary that evening, so we were ideally seated in a booth that was intimate, as well as comfortable. \n\nService, unquestionably superior. I would expect nothing less from a restaurant of such high stature. Allen, our server- was very accommodating. He executed very wonderful suggestions, that MADE our experience. \n\nTo start out, we got a vase full of long crispy bread sticks & a house smoked salmon dip. Let me tell you that if it weren't socially unacceptable...I would have licked the dish that the salmon dip came in, no problem. Needless to say, it was excellent, & I crave it daily. \n\nNext up to bat- Crab Cake & Lobster Bisque. Being a previous resident of New England & a connoisseur of food- I feel like a have a very firm palate when it comes to a few things, crab cakes & lobster bisque included. The Crab Cake was incredible, beautifully seasoned & served over a citrus flavored bed of corn relish. As for the Lobster Bisque, it wasn't too creamy- just perfect. It was really comforting & nostalgic to have some good New England food, without the 5 hour long flight. \n\nSeafood Plateau- Overwhelmingly fresh, standard assortment (oysters, oyster shooters, clams, mussels, lobster, crab claws, prawns). The ponzu oyster shooters...to die for! I was also a big fan of the champagne vinegar sauce that came with the oysters. Also, probably the biggest prawns I have ever seen. Very impressive! \n\nJohn Dory was my main course. Excellent suggestion from our server, Allen! Unlike any other fish I have ever had. It was sauteed on one side only, giving it an ambidextrous texture. I loved the crunch from the sauteed side, but the soft side exposed its sweetness, & also gave it a buttery finish. John Dory definitely tasted like fish, which was admirable to say the least. A lot of times, when seafood is over prepared, it loses that oceanic taste. Frankly, I would like my fish to taste like fish. The lobster succotash & sweet corn broth that it was served over was also delightful. It did a great job of complimenting the fish, without overshadowing it, with its bold flavors. \n\nNow, at this point- being a girl of 5'4\"/95 lbs, I'm surprised that I wasn't already stuffed & in a food coma. But, there really is always room for dessert. Apple Tarte Tatin- sweet savory apple chunks, covered in caramel served beside a salted caramel ice cream. I thought the salted caramel ice cream to be very inventive & appropriate!!! Creme Brulee- my one true dessert staple. I enjoyed the vanilla beans that were tucked under the custard, it made for a very yummy last bite. \n\nAquaknox was a great success! I look forward to making this our new go-to venue for seafood. The food exceeded my expectations, & the service was right on point."

We love the \"out of the box\" imagination of the new head chef, Deric Meininger. One of the taste sensations he created was an octopus carpaccio. Never has an octopus dreamed of being so tender! The creation process itself; cooking  the octopus and then allowing it to form as it cooled into the round that made the thin slices possible, genius. Chef loves fresh herbs, and used along with crisp  black olive bits, shallot, and a vinegarette that compliments rather than overwhelmed. Truly like nothing I have ever had and tender beyond belief.\n\nMin Lee, our most gracious host, sat us in our favorite booth and as always the wait staff served impeccably.  BTW the booths are very romantic, just enough privacy to steal a kiss, but not so much that you feel cut off.\n\nHusband loves the Aquaknox crab cakes so much that he ordered two as a main dish. We've had crab cakes in New England that paled when stacked next to these. Topped with lump crab, a creole remoulade and accompanied by a chayote carrot and daikon. \n\nI had welsh sea bass, perfectly deboned and served over fresh arugula tossed with squash and zucchini and peewee potatoes. Again chef Deric's love of fresh herbs gives this dish the right finish. Even the fish skin was an edible delight, and I normally  don't like that part.\n\nThe only restaurant that even comes close to Aquaknox in my heart is Osterica Gardenia in Venice Italy!  Suffice it to Say that I have never had a disappointing dish at Aquaknox. I cannot say the same for some of the overrated and underwhelming Rao....skip the at Caesars and head to Aquaknox instead. \n\nWe paired our meal with a lovely Delaporate Sancerre, perfect compliment. Oh, and dessert! Try the banana cream pie. Nothing like this reinvention of a classic. From the caramelized sugar atop the fresh banana slices to the delicate lady fingers base, the banana cream and served alongside a scoop of chocolate grand mariner and chocolate sauce. The sommelier brought us a desert wine to try, and I wish I had writen down the name as it was very good and not cloyingly over sweet. \n\nWe finished with a Warm Amaretto Cherry Milk served with brown sugar white chocolate swirl cookie. \n\nAll I can say is Aquaknox continues to impress."

Due to a variety of factors, including a hankering for fresh oysters, Hubby and I  decided to give this place another whirl. Boy was I glad we did.\n\nWe were seated in a lovely booth with high ceiling and cascading curtains. It was a bit drafty, so we moved to the booth next door. The booths were romantic and private, compared to the other tables.  \n\nOur servers, Mark and Zack, were attentive and approachable, not pretentious at all. Just a couple of nice guys who actually care about our dining experience. We didn't like the breadsticks but the dip they brought with it was delightful. We ordered a dozen fresh oysters, consisting of 3 varieties (Shigoku, Miyagi, and Gold Creek) and 3 sauces. They were super fresh and went down so easy with Prosecco, we ordered another dozen of the Shigoku Oysters, which were even tastier and slightly larger than Kumamoto Oysters. After two dozen superb oysters, we felt we had reached Oyster Nirvana. \n\nWe ordered a Romaine Heart of Lettuce to share. It was a generous helping even with the split. The lettuce was crisp and the Caesar dressing was spot on.  Then Zack surprised us with two small crab cakes which was compliments of the Chef. They blew our minds away! We would definitely order those again and again.\n\nWe ordered both the Steamed Mussels and Steamed Little Neck Clams to share. The Mussels were definitely the tastier of the two, even better than the mussels at Bouchon. You could taste the freshness in each bite. My Hubby loved the mussel broth so much he practically made a meal out of dipping the crispy buttered bread into the Chardonnay Herbed Butter broth. \n\nBy the time the Grilled Whole Branzino came, we were quite full already. It was a bit under-salted, but nothing a bit of sea salt could not fix.  Again, they split it into two nice plates for us and we devoured every last morsel. \n\nWe were too stuffed to order dessert but my Husband did enjoy the complimentary Chocolate Truffles at the end. This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again."

The blue theme of the restaurant really gives you the feeling of being underwater as you enter. We were offered booth or table seating and of course we chose to be nestled up in our own secluded booth--more comfortable and a lot more privacy! Here is a list of what we ordered:\n\n-Crab cakes: Bomb diggity! Probably hands down the best crab cake I've ever tasted. Their crab cakes were chunky and you can see that they used real crab and no imitation crab meat. Perfect to the touch that when it enters into your mouth, you can still taste the texture and consistency of the crab. Yum! The tartar sauce it comes with adds the perfect balance to the crab cake. Usually, I'm not a huge fan of tartar sauce because it is way too strong for my taste, but this one was just right. I'm so happy I gave this one a try!\n\n-Oysters: We ordered 6 oysters to start off our dinner with (2 small, 2 medium, and 2 large). The smallest ones from Washington were yummy. The medium and large ones from Washington and Virginia respectively tasted mushy like they were pregnant oysters. Definitely sticking to the smaller sizes from now on.\n\n-Fois gras: Served with a bread pudding (which I found to be quite interesting because bread pudding is usually served for dessert), a slice of bacon, figs, and greens. This dish was a mix of too many flavors and textures. The fois gras tasted very gamey to me. The bread pudding just didn't belong. The figs were sweet and chewy. The bacon was the only part of the dish that tasted normal to me. We didn't even finish this dish. Not a dish I would order again.\n\n-Sea Bass: Yum! Yum! Yum! This sea bass melts in your mouth the moment you eat it. So delicious! Came with chunks of lobster, corn, and edamame beans drenched in the sauce it came with. Very simple and pleasant to eat. \n\n-Bone-in-ribeye: Ribeye came sliced for you over a bed of mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes outshined the ribeye for me unfortunately. The ribeye was drenched in the house sauce they supposedly \"drizzled\" over the meat. I think it would have tasted better if there was less sauce, so that I would have been able to taste the quality of the meat.\n\nAll in all, excellent restaurant! I would come again, but would definitely stick to ordering the seafood items here!"

It pleases me to see that how its steadily grown.\n\nA quick note about the decor - it's date-worthy in a more less-romantic more-chic type of way.  I like when the lights changes color and getting a table with a good view of the wine cellar is always a plus.\n\nSo, don't let the entire seafood look and feel fool you.  What's really good here is the ribeye.  Several years ago one waiter proudly boasted to us that they have \"the best Ribeye in Vegas\".  Now, I think Vegas has many fairly good steak houses.  SW, Prime, Fix, Boa, and now Cut comes to mind, but this guy was not exaggerating.  It is really really good even when you compare it to upper echelon steakhouses' ribeye.  From some of the reviews I read - it makes me shiver thinking they may not have that ribeye anymore.  I don't know - I was at Vegas two weekends ago and also a month and a half ago, but I didn't have the opportunity to stop by.  I'll be there for Christmas and maybe once in between - I'll definitely check it out once during those two visits.\n\nAssuming it's still there - if you're looking to get a great ribeye that somewhere else would easily charge you much more for the same quality - this is a great place.  You can also get the ribeye with the surf and turf special, which lets you pick between either a crab-stuffed lobster tail or just a regular 'ol lobster tail.  Both are good, I prefer the non-stuffed lobster tail.  Nothing spectacular as far as lobster goes, but completes the meal just fine.  Beware though, from my experience getting the surf and turf \"special\" is identical as ordering both the lobster tail and the ribeye together.  As in, the price is just the two dishes put together.  Maybe save a buck.\n\nAnother awesome dish here is the scallops.  I don't remember if it's an entree or an appetizer, but if it's an entree, we order it and request it to be served like an appetizer.  It's large, tender, flavorful, and depending on the seasonal preparation it will have a nice matching secondary taste.\n\nCrab cakes were pretty decent too.  Nothing too \"wow wow wow\" but serves as a good alternative appetizer when in a large party.\n\nOverall, I've never had a bad experience dining at Aquaknox and I'm pretty sure I've been there at least 15-20 times over the years.  It's certainly one of the two restaurants I've frequented the most often @ Las Vegas and will continue to attract me until they somehow mysteriously decline (ala Postrio).\n\nHere's to hoping it stays great. :)"

I took a customer here for dinner and it was top notch all the way. Our server was Zack and he did an amazing job explaining the menu, making suggestions and just making sure we were well taken care of.\n\nWe started with the 1 pound appetizer of king crab legs- warm with drawn butter. They were delicious albeit a bit pricey at $72.  I had the scallops which were perfectly prepared served over creamed corn and a cauliflower pur\u00e9e. My client had filet mignon which she said was delicious.\n\nWe skipped dessert but we were brought a complementary amuse bouche of tuna (prior to our meal) and then a nice after dinner tasting of a pistachio tasting cocktail and a tiny pistachio flavored layer cake with custard.\n\nVery pricy, classy place.  If you've got a client or date to impress, come to AquaKnox but be prepared to drop about $150 per person with a bottle of wine or about $100 without."

I can only describe the food as fusion between fresh seafood with a hint of Asian. For example, if you direct you attention to my picture, my crab cake was topped with Apple salad. The apple salad closely resemble to what I had before in Thai restaurant. Kinda weird (but in a delightful way, hence the 4 stars review). Other main dishes were just as tasty. If there is any room for improvement, I would have to say that the sear Foie Gras was tiny bit over cook; otherwise, this restaurant would deserve 5 stars. Oh, by the way, Lobster Bisque is a must!!"

            "review": "This review is long overdue as this restaurant has continued to put out extraordinary dining experiences that leave diners in awe when they remember how good the food, service, ambiance and overall meal was.  Usually a restaurant will hit a home run in one or two of the categories but to knock it out of the park throughout each facet is very rare.  Our meal started with the Aqua Knox Plateau.  Lobster, oysters, prawns, mussels, ceviche, king crab and ponzu oyster shooters.  If i posted the picture, i think it would be the only picture needed to have you stop what you were doing and book immediately.  Too much to say as each item could have it's own paragraph.  To say the least, everything on the platter was fresh, ice cold, delicious and appetizing.  We were then treated with the King Salmon Tartare and Warm Octopus Carpaccio.  Both home runs.  Then we moved onto sharing the Butterfish, Whole Sea Bass and Fennel seared Albacore.  They didn't last long on the table. One of the most important facets of our dining experience is the wine pairing and our server was one of the most knowledgeable service staff we have had in a while.  I let him order the wine for us and didn't regret a single taste.  It's very rare in this trying economy to find a restaurant with service staff that take that amount of pride in cultivating their own palate to ensure a smooth and wonderful experience for the customer, just have to save kudos to that.  This server could have easily been the AGM and see a very bright future in his culinary career. Our meal finished with a dual dessert of cheesecake and flan and both were spectacular.  I would go back to Aqua Knox in a heart beat and can't wait to experience a meal of this caliber in the near future."

Well, that's what delirium does to you...your judgment gets all clouded.  This was my first meal during my long weekend in Vegas, and I was absolutely starving after a day of sun-worshipping.  We got to the restaurant around 10-ish Thursday night, and the place was pretty empty.  Yet, they still made us wait like 25 minutes at the bar.  Finally, once we were ravenous AND tipsy, they decided to seat us at one of the booths.  Very pretty decor, btw.  Aquaknox, you may have deceived my tipsy self into thinking I had a great meal here with your fancy decor and super-nice and attentive staff during that night (come to think of it, is there a restaurant in Vegas that DOESN\"T have super-nice and attentive staff?)  However, I have been schooled in the ways of Vegas dining since, and I am no longer impressed.  \nFor my entree, I ordered the Seared Main Scallops with mushrooms, spaghetti squash, and some Asian-looking green vegetable in a cream sauce.  After finishing off the scallops and mushrooms, I poked at the rest of my entree.  Now, I like veggies, but the way they prepared it was a bit...underwhelming.  I also tried the Seared Ahi Tuna, which was cooked perfectly.  However, I nearly choked on the excess pepper that was on that tuna.  Dessert was phyllo with walnut ice cream in a caramel sauce.  Pretty presentation, but taste was nothing special.  You're basically paying for the ambience and service here (minus the long wait).  One last thing...do NOT try the Ginger Beer....blech.\n\nOverall impression:  overpriced, mediocre drinks, and overly seasoned food (what are they trying to hide?)  I'd really give the place two and a half stars, but they were really nice when my also-drunk friend knocked over a glass and broke it while trying to get up, hence the three stars.  Would I come back, though?  Probably not."

They'll start with an Amuse bouche, then tasty bread sticks with salmon mousse - fabulous flavor.   Seafood appetizer (shrimp/crab/lobster) delicious! \nCalamari salad - friscee with a light panko calamari and dressing that was like a cake topper!\nChicken - I know at a place that does fish right -  but they know their chicken.  Hands down one of the best chicken dishes.  Crispy outside and juicy inside sitting on an artichoke/potato mash and a lemon butter sauce that I'm still dreaming about.\nScallops - cooked perfectly!\nSalmon with the bacon, chard and chive sauce you will not be disappointed.\nRoasted asparagus was a nice touch.  \nChocolate cake perfect ending -- except then they brought us carrot cake.  Frosting tasted like butter, only better.   \nService was exceptional.\nLocated in the Venetian Hotel.  A calming atmosphere and a place where you can actually talk and listen without over powering music.   If you have a party of 6 or under, try to reserve the circular wine room.  A good time to be had by all!"

From the food, to the ambiance, to the service, AquaKnox does an excellent job at creating a memorable dining experience.\n\nHere are a few of the dishes i highly recommend:\n\nTo start, I would definitely order the seafood trio. It consists of shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster cocktail, and blue crab cocktail with the house mustard sauce.  All three were delicious, but the blue crab was AMAZING! It was juicy & full of flavor. I would return just to have that crab! We also had a pot of clams (I can't remember the actual name of the dish) which was equally as delicious and flavorful.\n\nAs entrees we had the filet mignon and the John Dory. Again, both were great, but the John Dory was seriously superb. I'm usually a Chilean sea bass type of person, but I was pleasantly surprised by its great flavor. It was cooked to perfection - tender and juicy. This will definitely be my entree of choice if I get the chance to dine here again.\n\nWe did have dessert, which was very tasty, but I'm since not huge on dessert, many of them taste similar to me and thus don't really stand out. I will say, however, that their banana cake is probably the best I've ever had.\n\nSo, would I return? YES! Do I highly recommend? YES! In addition to excellent food, the staff was extremely friendly, not pretentious, and very knowledgable. If you're in Vegas and in the mood for seafood, you really need to give this place a try."

The plus was that they knew ahead of time that it was my husband's birthday and a late anniversary trip. So they greeted us with that in mind. It was just the two of us and we're both big seafood people. To start, he had the Steam Greenlip Mussels and I had the Lobster Bisque Soup...they were so delicious. \n\nWe enjoyed every bite of our starters and the portions were perfect. The lobster bisque was nice and rich and creamy without being heavy. It was good enough to want to come back - and that's considering there are restaurants at every corner on the strip, and even within the Venetian. \n\nThe Mussels were yummy. We're fans of curry so the aroma and spice were superb. To give it to you straight, they were bomb. Both appetizers were bomb. \n\nOur entrees consisted of the Ora King Salmon and the New Bedford Scallops. I had the scallops, so my review will be much more detailed than the salmon. The scallops come with squid ink pasta that is perfectly cooked. Initially, I wanted to devour the pasta, but slicing a piece of scallop paired perfectly. There were many different pieces to my dish and the flavors worked for me, I loved it. I couldn't finish the plate though, and ended up taking a scallop and some of the other pieces of the dish and took it back up to our hotel. My husband did not finish his either - but he did say it was delicious. I had a bite, and from what I could tell, it tasted great.\n\nSince it was my husband's birthday they came out with a surprise complementary dessert for us. They were two macarons with a pink yougurty drink. It reminded me of the little bottles of Korean yogurt drinks. \n\nYummy food. We love the Venetian and Palazzo in general so I'm sure we'll be back soon."

The hostess even called earlier in the day to confirm the reservation and confirm that it was an anniversary and that she would make sure they did something special for us.  Nothing special every happened....so that was kinda disappointing.  \n\nWe arrived and were seated promptly in a circular booth thing which was nice.  I'll agree with some other reviews that say the decor and ambiance is a little cheesy.  It is.  It's kinda Ikea-meets-modern-asian-fusion-vibe.  Everything just looks kinda cheap.  \n\nAnyway,  we were promptly greeted by the server (Miller) and he gave us some time to look over the menus.  When he came back he answered any questions we had.  He was very thorough and very helpful.  \n\nDrinks:\nShe got some rosemary gin thing.  I got an Old Fashioned.  Both were pretty average cocktails.  Nothing Spectacular.

So good.  \n\nOrdered more drinks:\nWe decided to get wine this time.  As we were looking at the list, the Sommelier noticed and stopped by the provide some recommendations.  He was honest and not trying to sell the most expensive wine, he was going based upon our likes/dislikes.  We ordered a two different wines and they were great selections.  \n\nEntrees:  \nShe got the Butterfish, I got a Filet.  Both were great.  The Butterfish was pretty amazing.

Why would the hostess bother to say \"we will do something special for you\" if there was nothing special.  My girlfriend even asked \"did you tell them it was our anniversary?\" I said, \"yup, but i guess they didn't want to do anything.\"  \n\nLike I said, the server Miller was great and the food was pretty good.

Actually, it's one of the best fine dining experience that I've ever had!!! The food was absolutely AMAZING and the service was excellent !! \n\nUpon arriving at the restaurant, we were promptly seated at the booths, and I'm glad we were, because the area's really quite romantic. The decor is just beautiful and the whole vibe of the restaurant was just great. Lovee the blue drapes that were hanging down from above. \n\nAfter placing our order, the waitress brought out a vase of breadsticks, along with smoked salmon sauce. The smoked salmon was really, really delicious. After finishing the breadsticks I just  had to finish the rest of the salmon. yummy. \n\nWe ordered the seafood plateau ($80), an appetizer  consisting of shrimp, raw clams, 6 raw oysters, oyster shooters, and lobster. ALL of the items were extremely fresh and delicious, especially the oysters, the clams, and the lobster. I also like the fact that the cocktail sauce had horseradish in it to give the overall thing an extra kick. Delicious. After the slowly enjoying each and every item on the plate, we were pretty happy and satisfied with the meal, but the best was yet to come!\n\nNext came the house salad ($11). It's a nice and simple dish that was arranged quite nicely on the plates.and was quite refreshing to have after the seafood appetizer.  \n\nAs an entree, we had the surf and turf, which was split between the two of us. I was quite surprised at how much food they gave us. We each had our own little steak (4 oz or a maybe little more?) and lobster (bf got the tail and I the claws). I must say... the steak's probably the second best I've ever had [after the bf's. but his steak can't be beat ;) Tender AND flavorful!!!  ] . The meat was nicely seasoned and just melted in our mouths. The lobster was equally amazing, if not better than the steak ! I thought that it was nice that they brought out a nice little contraption that kept the butter warm for us. But yes. The food was just sooo good...  and I was sooo happy when I was eating the entree haha. (We also ordered champagne, so that probably contributed to my overly happy state at the time as well. Oh, wine bottles are half off on Sunday! )\n\nAfter the meal, we were pretty darn satisfied, so we didn't order dessert. They brought us some little butter cookies, and I thought that was a nice gesture from them. \n\nThe food's definitely not wallet friendly (total came out to 250, exc tax), but it's definitely something you need to try at least once when you're in Vegas. I will be back !!!! hopefully. After I do some gambling and make more moneys =)\n\nPictures uploaded!"

Wanted to try the shrimp and  grits, too yummy!!! Bigger portions than expected ( that's a good thing)\nMy entree was a \"surf and surf\", yes I asked for half a crab stuffed lobster and the king crab legs.  OMG !!! It was perfect!!!  As you can imagine the service was impeccable !! Whatever your heart's desire, the staff will try to make it happened."
