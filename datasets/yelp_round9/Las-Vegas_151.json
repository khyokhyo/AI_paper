They were the best servers EVER!! \n\nWe got there just in time for a GREAT happy hour. We all ordered the pineapple coconut martini. It was the best!! And then got 2 orders of the best coconut shrimp I have ever had. Loved the crunch and the coconut was cooked perfect. The dipping sauce made it taste even better. \n\nWe then ordered a bunch of apps and they were all delish too. We also ordered the coconut mojitos. It was like a dessert. Sooooo good. \n\nBut our servers Jarrod and Raven made our night even better. They took such great care of us!! They were just amazing. They really know their stuff. \n\nI just wish Bahama Breeze was in California. I have to come all the way to Las Vegas to eat there."

Play-doh has more flavor. \n\nHowever, my carnivorous family loved their Jamaican Jerk wings & onion rings. Also, they had happy hour specials on some of their food items, so it was 1/2 off the wings & onion rings. \n\nNice atmosphere, lovely decor. They have live music some nights. \n\nI wish they'd offer more vegan options."

            "review": "Ate here with the bf about 2 years ago I'm surprised I haven't written my review. Oh well better late than never right? \n\nWe ordered the jerk chicken, coconut shrimp, seafood paella and warm chocolate pineapple upside down cake for dessert. The coconut shrimp was \"yummilicious\" (Maggie C I'm stealing your  adjective). Just the right amount of crunchy batter on the outside and plump and juicy shrimp inside. The jerk chicken was ok, I was expecting a little more heat, but then again that's just me and my taste buds. The seafood paella was the bomb. Not as good as my grandma's but close enough so that really says a lot. Of course I had to leave room for dessert. Warm chocolate pineapple upside down cake. Need I say more? It's got three of my most favorite food in the world: chocolate, pineapple and caramel syrup. Yes warm and uber moist chocolate cake topped with juicy, tangy pineapple slice on a bed of gloriously rich and gooey caramel syrup. Love it! Can't wait to go back for more."

My wife and I each choose a different fresh fish which came with rice or mashed potatoes and green beans.  We specifically asked to have our veggies cooked and not served crunchy like so many restaurants serve.   The meal did not come with soup nor salad not even bread.  We asked about bread but was told we could order a loaf for extra charge.  I did added a side lobster tail for an extra $9.99.   When our meal came the green beans were not cooked hardly at all.  They did offer to bring more.  Our mash potatoes were warm but not hot.  The fish was good but not great and they forgot my side lobster tail.  The manager came over and apologized which was nice but did not offer anything other than his apology.  I would have declined a free dessert but that would have been appropriate.\nI have eaten here before and it was better but will probably not go back for a while."

I got the portobello manchega (no taste) my girl got some sort of shrimp plate that just tasted like tomato. Ill give them this, the beef empanadas and artichoke dip were pretty good. House drinks were also very good. Service started off really helpful but drifted shortly. Having the little one with us we found ourselves making a trip to the restroom that you could smell from the bar so watch your step. Don't see us coming back"

However, the first time I ever dined at one was in Orlando. \n\nThis is a fabulous restaurant and it has a great ambiance. It truly reminds me of a meal in the Bahamas. The only thing missing were the geckos on the walls. \n\nFood is great, service is ok. Decor is perfect.\n\nand yes.....  I know it is a chain.  I typically shun chains and like all chains it will probably go down the big spiral.  But for now, I like it!"

It's a casual, family style restaurant and not really somewhere you would like to take someone out on a date if you are looking for something quiet to converse because it's pretty loud inside. It's pretty huge inside also, but I don't know how busy this place usually gets.  I doubt you need to call for reservations unless you're planning to come with a big group.\n\nI ordered the coconut shrimp and calamari.  Pretty good but I can't tell you about the other dishes since this is the only one I ordered.  But I'm sure if you come in a big group, you'll end up trying other stuff also."

I was expecting it to have a lot of seasoning and flavor, however it was just normal shrimp scampi. The lobster shrimp and fried chicken sliders were amazing though and made up for the shrimp scampi."

She got our drink order and away she went. \n\nWe finally got our drinks and we placed our app order, we got the spinach dip and chips, spinach  with artichokes in a creamy cheese dip was good! We also got a nacho made with plantans, this was good and a bowl of seafood chowder, also good. \n\nAbout here, I decided I wanted one of their specialty drinks so I picked out the blue hawaiian or something like that but after 25 minutes we had to ask for it again and when it came, tall skinny glass, I think maybe four sips and it was gone! \n\nFor main fair, I got the mahi mahi. It was good but our food and drinks took so long coming we both felt like leaving! My husband got the shrimp and cheesy grits, it was good. \n\nFinally when she came to ask about dessert we just handed her the bank card and said bill please!"

The flavor was a little bland and the rice was a little bit uncooked. The shrimp did not seem fresh to me. I was really disappointed because I love paella. The atmosphere is nice and the service was above average. They have a good lunch menu and some of the specials looked really appetizing. My experience would have been better if I did not have such a high expectation with the paella."

My husband got ice tea and it was horrible.  So, they brought a fresh brewed glass of tea, and it tasted bad too!   It tasted like old coffee.  We thought maybe they brew the coffee and tea in the same pitcher. But he assured us that doesn't happen.  We left and did not order food. We figured if they can't do something as simple as tea, that there could be more disappointments!"

The atmosphere was great,  chill for an afternoon margita (Sunday,  1pm) with no waiting for seating.  Our Waiter was Gerald,  I think.  He had some good suggestions and a great attitude.  Lunch special was good (Mahi mahi).  I suggest adding the $2.5 side salad,  a great value.  Margarita was a little on the sour side (many near the strip have been to me) not too weak though : ).  Will keep this place on the laid back weekend afternoon selection."

It's a bit corny, but overall tropical fun. It sort of reminded me of Margaritaville. \n\nAs for the food my boo and I ended up sharing the fire cracker shrimp and shrimp and lobster quesadilla. Both were very tasty and especially great for such a cheap price. My favorite though was the fire cracker shrimp, it essentially was fried shrimp with a siracha Mayo dipping sauce.

My companion had a jerk chicken sandwich and soup (can't remember what kind) he said was good. Lovely atmosphere (played island music) and nice wait staff.

We started with drinks & appetizers:  Rumrunner for the wife, a mojito for me, with coconut shrimp and conch fritters.  Rumrunner was delicious, but the mojito was not tasty and not well executed (mint wasn't muddled, lime wedges were un-squeezed and rock-hard, and it had crushed ice instead of cubes).  Shrimp and conches were both delicious, but they had the same sauce, which is a very minor criticism.\n\nWe had our minds on paella, which we ordered, and after all the fried stuff, we wanted something vegetable-y, which was not on the menu (unless you count salads, which we were not in the mood for).  On inquiring we were informed that there were broccoli, green beans, and asparagus available, of which we ordered the first two.  To our surprise and delight, the vegetables were nicely cooked and delicious.  The paella was awesome, especially considering they did not skimp on the seafood.  My wife didn't like the style of rice, but I thought it was appropriate.  It was also too much for us, and we ended up taking it home.  Since I'm writing this the day after our visit and I just had a fairly large portion of paella leftovers, I can report that it was maybe even better the next day.  \n\nBack to our visit, we were too full for dessert, so I just ordered an Irish coffee, which even after I verified that they would make it the proper way (coffee, Irish whiskey, and whipped cream), the waiter came back with this drink that he said had Kahlua in it, which I summarily sent back whence it came, which I felt they could have been a little more apologetic about.  The real drink, when it came back, kind of had an aftertaste like bottom-shelf spirits. \n\nThe ambiance was nice.  There was a musician playing tropical-themed music, which we quite enjoyed.  The service was fairly good but not superb; no complaints."

I ordered the seafood paella, and the waiter remarked that it was his favorite dish and it was just fantastic. The guy's nuts. There couldn't have been more wrong with it, save for the fish showing up raw (it was overcooked instead). Absolutely no flavor. They must not put any salt in the pot when they cook the rice, because I don't think there's any other way to make rice this unexciting. I suspect the origin of its yellow-orange hue didn't come from saffron, either. Don't remember what my fiance ordered, and neither does she, but we both remember it sucked.

Affordable and OK.\n\nOur server was fantastic - bright and bubbly, recommended a handful of items. It took us about 20+ minutes to get ready and order, yet she checked on us ever 5 minutes to answer questions.\n\nI personally got the Jerk Chicken, with cinnamon sweet potatoes, green beans and a mango pineapple salsa. I didn't taste much of the jerk seasonings - but then again, the menu DID say \"mild\". The sweet potatoes very very sweet, but it balanced with the salsa and chicken.\n\nOne of my co-worker's dish was forgotten by the food runner, so our server came by and said the manager comped the dish and a hot plate would be coming right up. Good service!"

Some of the food items aren't all that great with a few being grossly bland while others approach greatness.  The drinks generally outshine the food and are among the prettiest and most colorful concoctions I've ever seen while often being a bit too weak on the booze for my palette.  This is a pretty large restaurant that always seems to have a crowd and I really prefer sitting at the bar to be closer to the action so I don't get lost in the horde of other customers.  This isn't a place I would hang out all the time but it certainly can be fun on occasion for a little imaginary tropical flavor."

We went here because it had a claim that it was \"Gluten Free.\" Something I have to look for because of my wheat allergy so I was excited.\n\nThey didn't have a special GF menu which is not a big deal to me because typically the waiter will just fill me in or make his recommendations.  This waiter didn't know much about what foods or sauces had flour.  He didn't really have any enthusiasm to find out and come back and make some recommendations. So I had to McGyver my own meal which typically means I have to eliminate the sauces. I tip very well when waiters really know the foods and can make recommendations or atleast have the eagerness to find out for me. I don't typically eat out and this was going to be a real treat for me.\n\nI ordered scallops in butter sauce and the scallops were burnt and then raw in the middle. When I sent them back, they replaced only the one I ate half of.  I asked for a dinner salad instead and they gave it to me with croutons.  He took it back and picked off the croutons as crumbles were still there. What part of \"I can't eat flour don't you understand?\"  \n\nI sent back the salad and refused to eat as I swore someone would have spit in my food by now.  And let me tell you, I'm a very passive person when it comes to any problems with my food.  So I wasn't mad or anything and I didn't give the waiter any attitude. By the way, the waiter never apologized for any inconvenience or was concerned.\n\nThere was a huge two parties going on and every staff member kept coming in and out the patio doors fussying over the parties and most people seated were ignored and were very openly upset about the service by stopping random staff members for drink refills and to check on their food.  I was with two other people who swore it tasted nice but I don't know if they were just being polite as literally \"utter chaos\" was going on around us and we waited 45 minutes for our table when we called in advance for a reservation.\n\nI was treating my friends so I was shocked that I was given a \"$10.00 charge\" for food that was returned!  I hadn't eaten anything sat and drank myself silly over the ice tea and left more hungry than I came in.  There was absolutely no apology anywhere or from anyone and I couldn't believe the waiter was serious about this charge. So I didn't tip him.  Probably the first time in a really really long time that I haven't tipped a waiter.  Still feeling a bit guilty over it but it was a very bad experience and it wasn't me that night it was everyone else around us too."

We started off with the firecracker shrimp, coconut shrimp, and the fire-roasted jerk shrimp which were all pretty tasty. (Although I did prefer the coconut shrimp over the other two.) For dinner, I ate the lobster and shrimp pasta, without mushrooms, which had very little sauce, but was better than the one at Red Lobster. Our waiter was hilarious and also gave the birthday girl a long sugar cane, yes, sugar cane which was talked about for a good minute. My drink also came with a sugar cane inside of it, the Lemon Breeze, which I added strawberries too. Overall, the place was chill and the food was good, but not great. I think I would go back to see if it deserves that last star.."

I was recommended by some Las Vegas residents to try Bahama Breeze. \n\nWednesday night on January 14, 2015 was the first time I visited Bahama Breeze to have a meal.  This night I had my cousin and her family from Henderson join me for the dinner.  I found out that they have not eaten at Bahama Breeze as well.  A first time dining experience for the entire family to enjoy.\n\nA total of six individuals in our group (M1, M2, and M3 are the men.  F1, F2, and F3 are the females).  F1 (my cousin) ordered the garden salad and the ribs with fries.  F2 (me) ordered the Bahamian Seafood Chowder and Buttermilk Chicken Piccata with mashed potatoes.  M1 (cousin's companion) ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer as well as the coconut shrimp meal with broccoli.  M2 (companion's son) ordered a Portabello Burger with fries.  M3 (cousin's son) and F3 (companion's daughter) both ordered pasta.  One had asparagus and mushroom in the pasta while the other eliminated the asparagus.  Everyone finished their meal.  They all agreed that what they ordered for dinner was delicious.  Each dish was served with the right portion...just enough to make a person stuffed to the max. \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty big.  There's one section of the restaurant that can be used for reserved parties and it had a television for the customers to watch.  There was dinner music provided by a man playing the guitar and he sang a lot of cover songs.  He was located near the bar area and right behind the wishing pond.  The ceiling fans are actually the propellers from the boats.  The restrooms were very clean and there was a mouthwash dispenser for customers to use before or after a meal....that's one thing you hardly see in restaurant restrooms.  \n\nOverall everyone enjoyed the first time dining experience here at Bahama Breeze.  Employees were friendly and the waiters made sure that the drinks were not empty. Facility was clean and very beautiful.  Another major plus about the restaurant is that Bahama Breeze passed the Nevada health inspection by receiving a grade A. For my cousin and her extended family it would be a once in every six months treat for date night or family outings since the entree items are pricey."

But she failed to mention it cost $8 more.  Guess caveat emptor right???  But we all felt she should have mentioned the additional cost as we were ordering off the happy hour menu.  Other than that great service and ambiance the apps were all tasty the jerk chicken wings especially phenomenal"

            "review": "I like Bahama Breeze for something a little different.  It is part of the Darden family of restaurants (Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Long Horn Steakhouse) but this is neither Italian, seafood or steak.  Sure, they have pasta, fish and beef but that is not what they're about. \n\nBahama Breeze is about the feel of the Caribbean.  The place looks like a beach resort that one may find in, say, the Bahamas. There are palm trees, torches, fruity cocktails and an overall laid back atmosphere.  The menu is substantial and has something for just about anybody.  It is a restaurant/menu I have been enjoying for over 10 years.  \n\nI started coming here with my office for a holiday party.  Then we came back for a retirement party.  And again for a going away party.  Maybe even two.  I've come in with family a couple of times now also.  Each time I stop in I try somthing different.  Coconut shrimp (amazing and unfortunately not an option for me any more), chicken skewers and rice (not on the menu any more), West Indies curry rice bowl, jerk chicken pasta, buttermilk fried chicken with mashed potatoes.  I've tried the black bean soup.  I've tried a salad.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've had here.\n\nI've had some of the drinks too.  A sample of the coconut mojito which was good but very sweet.  A taste of the watermelon jalepeno margarita.  A zombie (which I seem to remember liking very much).  I did have an off pint of Guiness once.  Not sure what happened to that keg but it wasn't good.  However, I've also had a Newcastle here and it was spot on.  \n\nService has always been consistent and pleasent.  Even coming in on Mother's Day with a 7:00 PM reservation went off without a hitch.  We were seated just before our scheduled time and were waited on equally quick.  Having taken the time to look at the drinks and food, we ordered and just got to talking.  Before we knew it we had all that we had ordered and the meal had begun.  We were out of there by 8:15.  Not bad considering how busy this place was on a holiday."

I'm a big fan of their appetizers alone. During happy hour, all appetizers are half off so that's what my friends and I usually do. They also have a to-go menu for those on a tight schedule and wanna grab and go. \n\nThis is to get an idea of their schedule:\nStore Schedule // Sunday - Saturday: 11AM - 12AM\nHappy Hour // Monday - Friday: 4PM - 6PM\nLate Night Happy Hour // Sunday - Thursday: 9PM - 12AM\n\nHappy Hour includes these appetizers to much on (and the portions are pretty big):\n-Beef Empanadas\n-Firecracker Shrimp\n-Chicken Quesadilla\n-Firecracker Shrimp Street Tacos \n-Pork Carnitas Street Tacos \n-Adobo Chicken Street Tacos \n-Lobster & Shrimp Quesadilla \n-Skillet Simmered Jerk Shrimp \n-Coconut Shrimp\n-Jumbo Lump Crab Stack \n-Warm Spinach Dip and Chips \n-Jamaican Chicken Wings Tostones with Chicken \n-Crispy Onion Rings \n-Habanero Chicken Wings\n\nSO MUCH VARIETY HONESTLY. GOOD PRICE FOR GREAT QUALITY!\n\nThe place is clean, especially their bathroom, and I've heard their drinks are pretty amazing (they also have hand-crafted drinks for happy hour).\n\nI recommend this place if you're hungry at night and looking for something cheap for big amounts to fill you up! Also, just go to their happy hour!"

I mean I'm 5'3\" I get it--I'm not tall but when I sit in their booth the table is like at my chin.  I can't even imagine what little kids have to deal with. I almost asked for a booster chair if I would've thought my butt would've fit in it [should've tried anyhow]. Strike 1\n\nWhen we originally sat down it kinda smelled like cat pee, so we asked for another booth by the window-it was THAT bad, that one smelt much better; however, I was still chin deep in table.  Not the most comfortable way to eat lunch. Strike 2\n\nI asked if they had a calorie menu so that I could at least try to eat healthy, they did not. Strike 3 next batter.\n\nOur waiter was a little behind so another guy came over to take our drink orders. By the time he was done our waiter came over and took our order but basically asked all the same questions twice. So that was kind of annoying but we made it happen.\n\nWhat saved this place today [otherwise the stars would be much lower] was the food. I got the chicken tortilla soup [no tortilla strips-extra limes] and the fish tacos, ancho cream sauce on the side.  Both were delicious and actually pretty healthy [soup is like 300 calories 12 grams of fat, tacos 550 calories not sure how but 26 grams of fat? according to their website] minus the sodium which is super high in both.  I think next time I'll go with the plain old grilled fish.  My meal with drink was under $13.\nwhoohoo\n\nWhen we left we inquired about their happy hour apparently it's 4-6 M-F but she couldn't tell us what nights or times the steel drum band guy played Strike 4."

It's kitschy without too much.\n\nI informed the waiter about my allergies to certain weeds (shitlantro) and he recommended a dish for me. Now, I won't die if I get cilantro, but it's kind of unpleasant to my body and it tastes like soap. I got a few bites in and he came running to the table panicking about how the sauce turns out to have cilantro in it. He sent the manager over who recommended a new dish, didn't charge me for either, and then gave me another drink which was hella strong.\n\nThe fact that they showed so much concern even though I explained to them that it's not a fatal allergy unless I get a fair amount in me, shows me that they care about their clients. \n\nThe replacement dish, the mahi-mahi in a cream mango sauce, was absolutely to die for. Especially with a strawberry mojito. (the mango one was pretty bad, but was accidentally brought to my table by an errant waitress and I just took it rather than my strawberry one)\n\nWould I go back? Definitely. The food was good, the service was very pleasant, and they apologized profusely for their mistake, while making sure I was very well taken care of. I'd gladly recommend this to any of my friends."

It's your typical chain restaurant with oversized booths and waiters in tropical shirts, but we were both pleased with our meals and our friendly waiter. We had the beef empenada appetizer, the chicken kabob over yellow rice and the fresh jerk salmon of the day. The food was seasoned well and the menu has plenty to choose from without being overwhelming. \n\nThe food was reasonably priced for lunch and the portions were great, not too much food it was perfect.

It was not my first choice to go to..honestly I'd only seen this place in passing on my way to the airport.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, nice big building on the corner of Paradise and Flamingo on the Northwest side.  Walking in, however, you feel transported to another place with the Caribbean theme of the restaurant and bar.\n\nHowever, like a friend has told me, you can't necessarily paint something to make it what it ain't.\n\nThe food here is expensive for what you get.  We ordered quite a bit of food for the party: Spinach Dip and Island Chips, Island Onion Rings, West Indies Patties, and Creole Baked Goat Cheese to start.  None of these, to me, were particularly good.  The Spinach Dip was not even touched as my friend ordered it and then tried to pass it along to everyone else because she hated it.  The entree's were a little better: Cuban Sandwich and Margarita Chicken.  However for the $10 and $15 plates of food, I've had much better.\n\nThe service was slow for a slow Wednesday early evening dinner.  It was nice that we were able to sit in the atrium outside that was nicely cooled.  All in all, this seems like a poorly done chain restaurant based on a Caribbean theme.  My search shall continue (though how hard I look is yet to be determined)."

My favorite is probably the chicken kabob with steamed broccoli instead of rice.  Yes, even the rice was too greasy for me.  But the servers have always been willing to put in special requests and get the meal just the way I want it.  The problem is that it has taken a lot of experimentation to get there.

There is just nothing special about it that draws me back. To me this place is more of a place to get tootie-fruity drinks and some dip. Then it would be for an actual meal. It's almost like an upscale TGIF with bad food. \n\nThe waiters that helped us were quite helpful and were prompt. The place is clean and I had a good time. There food is just not my thing I guess."

This place reminds me more of San Diego and not the Bahamas. Service here isn't consistent. Good servers, bad servers and the in-betweens. The food is quite average. I've had great meals when I went to Bahamas so I'd always hope they'd remind me of my trip. They have conch fritters but it's disappointing. I must say their drinks are pretty solid though. Here's some that I've tried: \n\nYaka Hula Hickey Dula:\nRiesling, pineapple juice and dark rum. I like pineapple/pineapple juice, I like Riesling, rum is ok. Nice fruity but strong drink. 5/5\n\nUltimate Pina Colada:\nCaptain Morgan rum, strawberry and pineapple ice and dark rum. It's like drinking a smoothie - not much alcohol here. 4/5\n\nCrispy Onion Rings:\nLarge onions rings breaded with Panko and coconut flakes. The sauce is a sweet mustard...I'm not a fan. 2/5\n\nCoconut Shrimp:\nShrimps breaded with coconut flakes, citrus-mustard sauce on the side. This is supposed to be a best-seller. I'm still not a fan. 2/5\n\nBeef Empanadas:\nFried dough filled with beef and potatoes.  Comes with mango salsa and a dipping sauce. Forgettable. 2/5\n\nTostones with Chicken:\nFried plantains with sweet peppers, mushrooms, chicken, cheese and tomato salsa. Biggest mistake and probably the worst item on the menu. I love tostones and this was a major let down. There's so much going on with this dish. 1/5\n\nShrimp Creole Bowl, Chicken Curry:\nNothing to write home about. 2/5\n\nChicken Tortilla Soup:\nChicken breast, tortilla strips, carrots, roasted corn, avocado and lime. This is my go-to menu item when I don't feel like wasting my calories. 4/5\n\nBig Island:\nChocolate mousse, brownie, milk chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise. Chocolate mousse and vanilla anglaise are yummy...the brownie, not so much. 4/5\n\nWarm Chocolate Pineapple Upside Down Cake:\nWarm chocolate cake with a pineapple ring on top and a molten chocolate center, raspberry sauce and fruits on the side. I love pineapple, I love chocolate but I do not love this dessert. If there's rum in this cake, it would've been delicious. 3/5\n\nI've come here and have tried a lot of things on their menu but I just couldn't find anything that's good. I only come here for the liquid diet: soup and alcohol...and maybe the Big Island too. I'm just not in love with this place at all."

I am a big fan of their pan seared salmon pasta, however I learned it's been discontinued from their menu for years now :( (I was lucky last pregnancy, supposedly they still had the ingredients to make it when it was already discontinued) I'm very bummed because I drove from California just to satisfy my pregnancy cravings. I ordered their jerk chicken pasta instead which used to be my old favorite and it's still delicious. I told my family I probably won't be crazy about Bahama Breeze anymore since my favorite dish is no longer served. But..! my brother had ordered their Steak Oscar and I had a teeny bite and oh my! It was super yummy! There I was, sucked back in. Guess I will have to come back after I pop out this baby. Steak was topped off with crab meat in a creamy sauce and had such great flavors. Out of all our dishes that night, the steak was probably the best one ordered. My family really enjoyed their Long Island iced tea and I had their virgin pina colada which they are known for. My sister in law and I were also very impressed by their kids portion. We had ordered bow tie pasta for our kids and the portions were very generous for such a good reasonable price. \n\nAlso, I didn't order their haberno wings this time as I get major heartburn with pregnancy. But their haberno wings are always a hit!"

I wouldn't recommend the Mojito Cubano unless you're looking for an average glass of mojito. \n\nRecommendations off appetizers:\nCoconut shrimp- Perfect balance of shrimp and batter. Flavor was on point as well. \nCrispy onion rings- JUMBO sized onion rings\nJumbo Lump Crab Cake- Crab can taste a little like the sea, but the shrimp avocado and mango salsa made up for it. This dish tasted really fresh, I would recommend it if you like crab and shrimp. \nWarm spinach dip, chips, and salsa- The salsa was delicious! Artichoke was mediocre. \n\nChicken quesadillas- Nothing special\nButtermilk Fried Chicken Sliders- This was okay, wasn't extra savory or anything. \nHabanero wings- Disappointment. Wasn't spicy at all. \n\nInterior very spacious and our waiter was friendly. Will be back if in the area."

I love the atmosphere (the decor is tropical), the food is excellent, and the caribbean music (free entertainment) adds to the overall fun feel of this restaurant. It's easy to feel good in this type of restaurant. I've only been here for dinner, but about ten times. (Twice for an e-mail member event- that was fun!) The service is really good. The location (Paradise/Flamingo) is in \"Restaurant Row.\" It's very easy to get there from the Strip, if you are just visiting. If you're coming for dinner, make a reservation, because this is a very popular restaurant. Outside seating is nice, if you can stand the heat during the summer months.  \n\nMy favorite appetizer is the Coconut Shrimp. It's now the best all around in Las Vegas, since Red Lobster's version has changed. I don't like a whole lot of breading- like how they do so often at chinese restaurants. It's definitely not the case here. Also, the size of the shrimp is pretty good.  \n\nMy favorite dish here is the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Pasta. I am not usually a fan of creamy sauces, but I make the exception here. It is the perfect blend of bowtie pasta, jerk chicken (love that spice combination), mushrooms, and asparagus. It's the best thing on the menu. But that's my opinion. I've tried other things on the menu but I keep coming back to this dish. \n\nAbout the prices, it's a chain restaurant, so the prices are going to be slightly higher than some restaurants out there. Frankly, I didn't think that the Planet Hollywood restaurants are anything special, but they still remain popular today for some reason. I would rather go to Hard Rock Cafe, but now, my husband doesn't think those restaurants are anything special either.        \n\nSInce I love this place, I am sure we will be back again."

While waiting for we started noticing that all the orders in our area of the restaurant were wrong. The servers were running around like keystone cops trying to correct everyone's orders.

The food was pretty good as always but the service was probably a 2 out of 10. Your server can make or break your experience and our server broke it. From our initial greeting to leaving it seemed she was going through the motions. I noticed other tables had a candle lit. Ours was unlit. I waited 15 minutes and finally lit it my self. Our server just did not want to give us the experience we deserved. Maybe our server was having a bad day or just tired as it was 8:30-9:30 pm. She just didn't smile or seemed enthused\nabout serving us. I was also unhappy that they did not sing to my sister and charged 8 bucks for her birthday desert. I have never been charged before at any establishment. My Mojito was all ice. I think the bartender needs a lesson from Havana Grill in Henderson on a proper Mojito. Seafood Paella, wood fire chicken and burger were good but not great. I hope our next experience will be back to the standards we expect from Darden and especially Bahama Breeze.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe manager called me today 03/10/13 and offered to make it right.He also stated his first priority was to ensure that i will have a good experience...I want to thank the manager for the phone call and glad to see Bahama Breeze cares about the satisfaction of their costumers......."

Their habanero wings were great with a sweet and spicy sauce which only left a slight tingle on the tongue but still packed with flavor.  We also enjoyed the jerk shrimp appetizer which was shrimp scampi bathing in a pond of buttery broth with very subtle jerk seasoning, not overpowering like I had anticipated, and served with a French bread loaf for soaking up the flavorful broth.  My entree was their special: A lobster, shrimp, and mussel bowl with baby potatoes and butternut squash, swimming in a tomato herb soup also served with French bread for dipping.  Slightly different seasoning compared to the Italian or cuban versions I've had before, with similar seasoning as their jerk shrimp, but not overpowering.  Overall the food was great and the service started out good, but at the end we sat waiting for our server and bill, so a little let down there, but otherwise a real treat!"

HUGE mistake! It started with a very nice waitress who came to my table... it started like this,\n \n'Today's specials are A, B, C, and D. We are out of A and B, and if you want C, we no longer have chorizo that goes in it but we can substitute it for something else.'\n\nUm what??! \n\nSo we asked her for her suggestions and her 'most recommended' items were the Lobster Linguine and the Key West Shrimp and Grits. My husband and I ordered both dishes. Disgusting. You know what this reminded me of? It reminded me of something premade that comes in a bag and thrown in boiling water to heat up.\n\nReally disappointed. We had just wasted money on food that tasted nasty and we were walking out hungry. Never, ever, again. Visited this location June 2014."

So definitely a good deal.\nI got steak with plantains and beans. Flavors were great but my steak was kinda cold. My husband got a cream cilantro chicken dish that was absolutely yummy.\n\nDessert was molten chocolate cake with pineapple. It was good but nothing really outstanding about it.\n\nThey also offer happy hour and late happy hour. I'd recommend catching those. Their appetizer options are all half off which makes that lobster quesadilla only $7 yum!"

After trying our appetizers we began to share food, because everything was seriously soooooooo good. For an appetizer, order the Jamaican jerk wings, they are the best wings and cooked perfectly. They have a happy hour after 9 with half off appetizers and special drinks, so well worth it. Fresh lemonades made with real fruit and shaken for you. Really delicious! Kids pasta is great and serving size is big. Salads are huge also. Really, nothing bad to say about this place, food came fast, great live music and friendly staff.\nAlso had the empanadas, coconut shrimp, fire cracker shrimp (my personal favorite), ribs, jerk chicken pasta, shrimp and grits, steak and crab stacks. I'm sure there was more but bottom line everything was good. You will not be disappointed!"

Thank goodness I picked Bahama Breeze! I tried to make a reservation a week or so in advance and was told to just call the morning of. I was a little skeptical but thought, ok fine, let's see. Called the morning of and got a reservation, no problem at all. Had to wait about 20 minutes once we got there for the table to be ready, and had to have them add more seats 3 times, for some reason they kept counting wrong. But all the staff was very sweet. Had two servers, one was named \"Red\", both were AWESOME! Took a while to get drinks out, but with 18 people that can be expected. My hubs and I had some Mojitos, the avocado crab stack, coconut shrimp, fish tacos and side salad with fruit vinaigrette. Everything was DELISH! I mean like super, awesome, very, very good!!!!!! They also let us each have separate checks which made paying SO much easier! Thank you Bahama Breeze for making my birthday dinner amazing! All 18 people loved their food and drinks, and that's not an easy task!"

Friendly, engaging, knowledgeable, and even engaged us as we asked about how the local dining businesses were faring in the current economic state. He was actually a PT waiter at another restaurant, and he helped us pick our dishes.\n\nThe food was surprisingly tasty. I had the jerk chicken bowtie pasta, which was slightly spicy but in a good way.\n\nAlthough I might not go actively searching for this place next time I am in Vegas, I would recommend it if you're looking for a reasonably priced, tasty meal."

The rice and beans were ok but overall I was disappointed with my selection. It also took a long time to get drinks from the bar...like our food came out quicker than drinks did (alcoholic beverages).\n\nPros: great ambiance. Clean restaurant, live music, and decent pricing. My husband got shrimp scampi and said it was really good. We had a Carmel cheesecake and that was yummy. Our waiter, Joe, was awesome!  Great personality and really treated us well.

This last time featured a waiter that was very into his job and described menu items with words like \"exquisite.\"  It's refreshing to have a waiter who is knowledgeable and happy to help.  The decor is clean and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nWe decided to start with the Tostones appetizer, though we weren't quite sure what to expect.  The plantains were crispy and the flavors diverse and delicious.  Despite not being much of a seafood eater, I always go with the fresh fish at the front of the menu.  Normally, it's the mango glazed tilapia.  This time I went with the Mahi Mahi as per the waiter's recommendation.  It wasn't as good as the tilapia, but it was still yummy.

I'll be waiting for the next trip to Sin City, and soon so I can use the coupon they sent me by email."

I also love their dessert drinks. \n\nI feel like I'm on a mini vacation when I come in here. Maybe it's the Banana Strawberry Daiquiri that puts me in the mood. The sips I took were fantastic ! My husband didn't like his Sangria (they don't serve it with fruit in the glass) so he drank half of my Daiquiri. My sister in law who is the \"non drinker\" wanted to taste it so I let her. \n\n I started with the Coconut Shrimp ($9.49) for an appetizer it is big enough to be the whole meal. I just love the Citrus Mustard sauce it is served with...it's addicting! My sister in law shared her Roasted Cuban Bread ($5.99) . It had sliced vine tomatoes, basil, and Parmesan cheese. It was good ...It think it would be nice to eat with a salad. \n\nMy main entree was the Calypso Shrimp Linguine ($13.99 lighter portion). I'm glad I ordered the lighter version because it tasted okay but it was nothing to write home about. It tasted a bit bland to and I would not order it again. \n\nWe ended the dinner by ordering two desserts to share with the table. We had the Chocolate Island which is a chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie swimming in milk chocolate and vanilla bean anglaise. This was my favorite of the two! The second dessert was Banana Nut Supreme it has sliced bananas and vanilla ice cream topped with butterscotch brandy sauce. It tasted okay but everyone at the table liked the Chocolate Island the best! \n\nThis is a nice place to unwind after work because they also have a Happy Hour menu!"

My husband loves coconut shrimp, so I looked up restaurants that served them. There was  Bahama Breeze and Kahunaville, (which is in T.I.) I made reservations with Kahunaville for later in the week,... (which we HATED)... but went to the early happy hour at Bahama Breeze.(they even have two happy hour times, early and late) Kahunaville, ended up being one HUGE MESS of noise, and the food was mediocre and expensive,( I reckon because it being on the strip). \n  But back to Bahama Breeze. The place was great! It is in a mall of restaurants and parking was a ...\"breeze\"...(get it?)... It had the atmosphere with the truly tropical feel of  shutters, lanais, wood,  bamboo, gardens, fire pits, open and airy. Man, even the men's restroom was great! \n  The happy hour menu was fantastic! $3.00 & $4.00 drinks, and 1/2 off appetizers! Our server was Sam, and she was great, fast and efficient.\nWe had the beef empanadas: nice and spicy, with a nice fruity salsa, the warm goat cheese dip with flatbread crisps: GREAT! The cheese comes in warm bell peppers. The coconut shrimp: you get 6 fairly large perfectly seasoned shrimp with a spicy mustard sauce... in fact my husband ordered two of them... The tropical drinks we ordered were far more superior and tasty than Kahunaville... and a lot less expensive! \n  Over all Bahama Breeze got our vote for BEST \"Island food and drink\" in Las Vegas.\nIn the words of a past Governor of CA, \" I'll be back!\" I want to try it all!"

(Apparently there is also a reverse happy hour that happens 9-close!) We LOVE it.\n\nWith its tropical, breezy, just-sitting-out-on-the-veranda ambience, their specialty drinks are matched to boot. We usually indulge in these $4 perfectly garnished and charming cocktails. Ultimate Pina Colada, Bahamarita, Mojito Cubano, Pineapple Coconut Martini. (I've tried them all except the sangria and margarita on the rocks.) They're so pretty that you'll want to bust out your phone and be that person at the table. You know, *that* person.\n\nIf this doesn't suit your fancy, they also offer select beers for $2-$3, wines $2 off, and the standard mixed spirits for $3. \n\nAppetizers are half-off and are consistent with the quality of their drinks - flavorful, garnished appropriately, infused and influenced with its caribbean namesake. They offer a wide variety, so all mouths are sure to find something to pique their taste buds. The coconut shrimp seems to be a popular choice, but I recommend the beef empanadas, which is what I ordered on a recent visit. \n\nRound up your friends, relax and take a breather at \"Bahama Breeze.\" Totally worth it."

            "review": "The hardest thing is deciding where to start, especially considering I never write reviews.  We had never been to Bahama Breeze before and with trying any new place there is always that slight worry. We walked up to a restaurant that looks as if it was flown in from the Caribbean up to the hostess' stand and were warmly greeted. We were shown our way to the table and were given their menu which has an extensive selection, especially the house cocktails. We were delightlfully greeted by our server Sandra and we informed her it was our first time and we would need a moment to take in the vast menu. She was truly polite and gave us some suggestions and brought us our water while we mulled everything over, that's when our excitement started going up as we looked at the specialty drinks. \n\nI'm not a drinker and the fact that these drinks caught my eye is a good sign. We started off by ordering a truly delicious Bahama Margharita (an infusion of pineapple, strawberry and kiwi with tequila) and my girlfriend a Strawberry Banana Daquiri. Both drinks made to perfection. We started our appatizers in a simple manner with wonderfully crisp coconut shrimp as well as chips and salsa, both which were brought to us very quickly, while we continued to look at the menu. All the while Sandra keeping an eye on us and ensuring our satisfaction. Finally we decided to settle on the Baby Back Ribs for myself an the Filet Mignon for her. \n\nThe meal was astounding. The ribs were falling off the bone and well sauced, and the mashed potatoes I requested with them were delicously creamy and flavorful. My girlfriends filet was cooked to perfection and her sides were enjoyed with gusto. We ordered another round of drinks (keep in mind drinks aren't my thing so they must be good for me to order another) but we decided to try something different. My girlfriend tried The Blue (something, I don't recall the rest of the name sadly) and I enjoyed the Berry Berry Good. Both of us would share drinks to try more of a variety and we fell absolutey in love with the Berry Berry Good, as i quote my girlfriend, \"next time I'm getting five of these.'  I'm confident I will as well.\n\nNext we go on to the dessert. When we are as stuffed as were at the end of a meal we don't even consider it, but we figured this place has been so amazing how can we say no? Dulce de Leche Cheesecake and a Chocolate Island (a chocolate cake with chocolate mousse sitting in a delicate sea of a vanilla bean sauce) I didn't want to take it home, i just wanted to eat everything there and get another order to go, it was that incredible. We were so delighted at the end of the meal and asked to see the manager (Jesse is his name) and couldn't begin to describe how happy we were.\n\nAll this alone provides something worth noting, but what will truly brings us back beyond anything else is Sandra. We can confidently say that she is without a doubt the greatest server we have ever had. Truly charismatic and professional. When were were looking at our menus in the beggining we saw that she was busy but never once did she let that bother her nor take away from the quality she was providing not just us but everyone. We had great conversations with her and never once did we feel rushed or neglected, it was the exact opposite. She made our night, so much so that on the drive home we were still talking about how amazing she is (plus the quality of the restaurant) We will absolutely make sure that when we go in next we will request her (and if there's a wait we will not mind at all) I cannot stress enough how she truly is the greatest server we have ever had. She is a gem that must never be lost. \n\nEverything about this place is remarkable. They took two first time diners and in one fantastic experience made us die hard fans."

While driving around, the BFF and I happened to see Bahama Breeze. I know, I know, it's a chain -- but it has a fun, vacation-y appeal, so we called from the car to ask about group events.\n\nOptions from the low $20s per person? Cash bar available? Sign us up! We swung in for lunch to try as many menu items as we possibly could. The tostones and coconut shrimp both made for very tasty appetizers, although the tostones were a little dry -- but once you add all the cheese and toppings, yuuuuuum-ola. We both agreed our entrees were good, although now I can't remember what Jess got (some sort of chicken sandwich?). I tried the tilapia and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was, and it came with cinnamon sweet potatoes! We even had dessert, fantastic dulce de leche cheesecake (with an excellent graham cracker crust).\n\nI will readily admit that I would probably only normally give BB more like 3 stars; however, this location was so upbeat and fun, the staff members were all so friendly and helpful, the drinks were so cheap... that I'm bumping it up. AND, it looks like it will be the perfect place to host a meet & greet, so if you're looking for a group event place, I'd definitely consider it!\n\nP.S.

We went on a Sonday evening after making 'call ahead seating' reservations.  When we arrived, we were seated right away.  The service was immediate and friendly.  The menu has a good selection and a huge drink menu.  The atmosphere was  very  authentic  and casual.  Easy to find and  their own parking lot right off the street.  My sister had a fabulous tropical drink, suggested by our waiter, that she not only loved but only cost $6.00.  We both had seafood which was fabulous.  When the bill arrived, we were pleasantly surprised how reasonable it was for all we got.  We will definitely be going back again and I will recommend this place to everyone!"

We went Monday night and a lot of reviewers commented that the concept for the restaurant and it is terrific...it really is nice.  But for us, that was where it ended.  Our service was very good (Thanks Sparky!)  My wife had the curry chicken for dinner...it was so dry and lacked flavor she could not eat it.  She ordered a strawberry magarita and she got a mango margarita instead.  We sent it back and this time it came back with only a little mango in it.  WTF?  The bartender could not make a most simple drink?!?!  To top off our drink issues...The pour on the tequila had to have been a 1/2 ounce if that...it was like drinking mix only and then it was served in a martini glass!.  If you don't have margarita glasses put it in a hurricane glass, those they had..  I had the paella and a couple of beers...it was a safe bet .  My daughter had the jerk chicken pasta, again, just okay, kind of lackluster in flavor.  To drink, she ordered a Bailey's and coffee...served in a regular ol' coffee mug.  A place like this I would have expected a clear mug to showcase the drink...nope, didn't happen.  I know some of this may seem like petty things but...our bill was close to $100 for the 3 dinners, drinks oh...and an appetizer.  The entrees did not come with any type of salad offering either.  Over priced and the Monday night bartender(s) needs a bit work.  We did voice our comments to the manager (actually we were going to leave and our server sent the manager to us!).  He said he will talk to his staff and try to fix things.  He did give us 3 comp drink tickets to use anytime.  One thing we do not do is complain to the manager in order to get a comp meal, we usually will talk to the manager AFTER we pay.  Getting comp'd is not the point, bringing issues to management's attention so they can resolve the problem is the larger issue."

Pretty good 'island' food and a fun environment for the money, and you will definitely not leave hungry, I have had leftovers each time I ate there.\n\nYou HAVE TO get their Cuban Bread for an appetizer, it is pretty simple but my mouth waters just thinking about it.  I have had the paella, coconut shrimp, a chicken pasta dish, and a lobster/shrimp pasta dish and I would order any of them again.  There was something about the chicken pasta dish that I REALLY enjoyed, a tangy garlic cream combo flavor and really tender chicken and mushrooms.\n\nTheir red beer is satisfying and for only a couple bucks for a 20oz mug you can definitely throw back a few with no damage to the wallet.  They also have a lot of frozen mixed drinks that looked good but I cant comment on them as I mainly stick to beer when I have a drink. Enjoy!"

Not enough pop and flavor for me. I was looking for that citrus pop of freshness but it wasn't there. The tortillas were a little chewy. Food alone would have gotten them a three, but when you throw in the awesome service, you can't beat it.

He got my iced tea.\n\nI ordered a cup of black bean soup and the coconut shrimp.  The bean soup was brought in a short time drizzled with a back and forth with a cilantro-crema.  The crema didn't really give the soup any flavor.  It seems it was more decorative than functional. \n\nThe main course--coconut shrimp--was brought with the correct amount of break between appetizer and main.  The shrimp were good and it had been quite awhile since I had coconut shrimp which I like.  It was served broccoli and yellow rice.  The shrimp were good but I think it would be better as an appetizer than a main.  \n\nFor dessert, I got the chocolate island, a dessert the menu describes as \"rich chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie island in chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise.\"  It was a very good dessert and the best part of the meal.\n\nMike's service was very good.

But the one that looked the most appealing (mostly, since we'd never heard of it) was Bahama Breeze. Seeing that the closest location was the one in Vegas, we saved the gift card for our trip to the Strip.\n\nWalking in this place was like entering into a different world. It was amazing. They don't commit to theme so blatantly like Rainforest Cafe or places like that, but in a natural and organic way where it still feels homey. \n\nThe lady who sat us down spent a couple minutes explaining to us what she liked best on the menu. Then, our waiter, Eamon, got over to us and he, too, gave us his take on the menu, breaking down each section, since he knew we had never been there before. \n\nI'm the type of guy that likes to get what's popular at any restaurant, so he informed me that the Jerk Chicken was their best item. \n\nI was hesitant about it, because jerk chicken has not really ever been my style. But with risk comes reward, and this reward was worth it.\n\nThe meal ($17) came with three large pieces of bone-in chicken, black beans, rice, and plantains. The chicken was some of the most moist I've ever eaten, and the spices on the chicken loaded it with some amazing flavors without ever being too spicy. You'll definitely remember the taste more than the spiciness. The black beans were probably the best I've had. And the plantains were great (if you like plantains), especially when dipped in the Caribbean salsa that they put there on the plate. The rice was a little too saffrony for me and I wasn't a big fan, but my fiancee loved it.\n\nShe ordered the Skillet Jerk Shrimp ($12), which was amazingly tasty! It was jam-packed with flavor, and came with a garlic-thyme butter sauce that I couldn't stop dipping the bread in (her dish came with a roll of bread). \n\nAltogether, this place will now be a mainstay on our trips into town, much like the Peppermill has become. The waiter was amazing and so was all of the food and the atmosphere. The prices, also, were very reasonable--especially considering what town we were in."

I ordered my usual ( Cuban Black Bean Soup, and Jerk Chicken Wings), my wife ordered the Portabella Mushroom Burger.  When he explained it was a hamburger, with a mushroom on top, my wife requested just a \"burger\" made with the Portabella mushroom as the burger.  I guess the special request was just to complicated.  First she got a open faced bun with a mushroom and veggie mix on it.  She requested the same thing again, and this time it came out as she requested, at about the start of the second bite, a small black bug crawled out from under the lettuce and casually walked across the corner of her sandwitch.  We called the waiter, pointed out the intruder, and he promptly took it back.\nHe then asked us if we wanted any desert.  We didn't quite understand the question, so we said no.  He brought us our bill.  \nWe didn't understand.  My wife had had nothing to eat at this point.  We didn't ask for anything else we just thought he would replace her un-eaten sandwich. \nThe manager did come over and apologize, and told us how sorry he was, but her sandwich was not replaced.  \nAs we were leaving, I told the hostess the story, she hailed the manager who apologized again, but didn't seem to understand when I explained that my wife was leaving your establishment Hungary.

He was really silly and down to earth; he didnt have to try to impress us to make us like him! I got a salad with fruit and shrimp and it was heavenly! Got the top shelf margarita as well - it was a little more sour than im used to but was still pretty good. Overall, beautiful restaurant for a calm weekend lunch. We both felt like we were far away from the Vegas desert dining in there!"

We went over obviously with high expectations and we were not let down whatsoever. \n\nI would like to mention that the service here is phenomenal. Our waitress, Tina, was probably one of the nicest waitresses I have had in along time. She was personable, she would talk and joke with us and just super nice. I have no complaints about service at all. \n\nThe atmosphere in this place is pretty rad as well. There was live music, a little covered deck with a fire pit, and a lot of cool decorations that made for a great environment. This place is mainly a seafood restaurant, so if that's not your thing then this place probably isn't for you. I'm a huge seafood fan so I loved it. \n\nLast of all, the sought after pina colada that we were searching town for were hands down the best I've ever had! There was more to it than just your average pina colada, it was called the \"ultimate pina colada\" for a reason. Me and my girlfriend both were very impressed with it. We weren't too hungry so we just got some street tacos to shared and they were great as well.\n\nWe sat and hung out at this place and just talked for a while because it was such a great environment to just relax and have a great time. \nIf you're in Vegas,  GO TO THE BAHAMA BREEZE! You will not be disappointed."

Quality of the food was comparable to fast food. \n \nI keep hearing good things about this place, but I was disappointed. They sat us in the patio area. The patio is a nice open window area with a gas fireplace in the center. The fire creates a nice mood and the fresh air is lovely. However, its not the greatest on a warm day. Also you can smell the gas or propane that fuels the fire when down wind. It can be nauseating after a while. Our server is a nice guy, but noticeably disinterested. We place our order with an appetizer. The appetizer is delivered but utensils or napkins were not provided. We flagged an employee, and let him know we didn't have any napkins or utensils. A few minutes later he produced a handful of cocktail napkins. We needed to flag another person for the rest. The appetizer tasted horrible. Ahi tuna should not have a heavy fish flavor. Our main order was delivered by an individual who was not amused by our misunderstanding of what he said when asking \"who ordered what\". It was clear that he was quite unhappy with this duty. I had ordered a Cuban sandwich. It tasted fine, but was ordinary. You can find the same quality at any subway or port of subs. Nothing impressive. We decided we had enough and requested the check...I can still taste the tuna, it was pretty bad."

I will be ordering that often;  It's a new regular dish for me. \n\nThe reason this place hasn't earned 5 starts, is because their key lime pie leaves a lot to be desired (both my wife and I agree on this).

Their appetizers are half off during happy hour and the portions are what make it worth your while. \n\nI got the crispy onion rings, the lobster & shrimp quesadilla, and the Jamaican chicken wings. For a drink, I just stuck with the coconut water.\n\nThe crispy onion rings have a panko-coconut breading that's fried to a golden-brown. The coconut flavor is really subtle, but you can't go wrong with this classic appetizer.\n\nThe lobster & shrimp quesadilla was pretty amazing. Who would've ever thought that cheese and shellfish would be a perfect match? They came with pico de gallo and sour cream on the side, which go perfect with these little triangles of cheesy goodness. The lobster seemed a little sparing, but the shrimp was definitely there.\n\nThe Jamaican chicken wings had the perfect marinade to it. The jerk spices added a unique zing to the wings that blast your tastebuds with rich flavor! The spiciness factor isn't too hot. It won't burn your tongue, but it definitely has a noticeable kick. \n\nI'll be back to try their entrees, but their appetizers are really something special. Any place that has amazing deals for their happy hour is worth it to me!"

The selection was definitely there.  They had well over a dozen drinks.  A whole page in the menu, and a             booklet on the table.  Unfortunately, the two that I tried were pretty bad.  The first was a zombie.  This drink didn't look, or taste like any zombie I've ever had, and I've had a few.  I actually wondered if my order got mixed up somewhere.  Whatever it was, it was mediocre at best.  I thought a strawberry mojito would be a safer bet, since that's almost impossible to mess up.  Well...almost, right?  It looked, and tasted more like a bad daiquiri.  It was way too sweet, and apparently made with Pucker.  The only mojito thing about it was the physical presence of mint in the glass.  I tried a friend's cocktail- The Painkiller, and wasn't too into that either.  The mix of rum, and coconut cream is nice, but again, way too sweet.\nThe food was...okay.  Our friend ordered the jerk chicken, and seemed to really enjoy it.  We wanted to order some fish.  Three varieties were available, but they were out of the one that we wanted.  The salmon was cooked well, but the sides were not.  Gummy mashed potatoes, and oily under cooked green beans.  Oh well, at least they weren't frozen.  \nI won't be rushing back here anytime soon."

I love shrimp so I had to try it. They gave us the plate and there was a lot of shrimp, I mean, a lot! It was awesome! The linguine was perfectly cooked al dente, the pasta was sauteed with garlic, onion and tomatoes with a hint of spice and cream. The amount of cream was perfect and not overwhelming and there literally was shrimp in every bite. Pastas are usually topped with shrimp, this one also had shrimp in between. It was so good and the price was awesome! $18.00 for a large portion which my friend and I could not finish.

The first thing I noticed was that the TVs were playing reruns of South Park.  Now, I'm no prude, but there were lots of children around and the sound was on.  I don't know that I would take too kindly to someone playing that kind of show during a lunch with my children.  No one complained, but it kinda rubbed me the wrong way.  A small thing, but a little disturbing and not typical of what I've seen at Bahama Breeze.\n\nOur server came and took our order, which consisted of ham and cheese croquettes for an appetizer, soup and salad for me, and the chef's special for my fianc\u00e9.  Our food came out quickly, but sans appetizer.  I asked the person who brought our food where the appetizers were and she went to investigate.  I had to endure listening to loud arguments in the kitchen until, finally, they figured out that the waitress never rang up our appetizer.  Never mind that the operating system computer was literally two feet from our table... somehow she forgot.  No biggie... it happens... except that she was NOT apologetic at all.  She came over and said, and I quote, \"I forgot to put in your appetizer order.  So do you still want them or not?\"  She said it like it was MY fault that it happened.  I didn't wanna pay for an appetizer to be eaten AFTER my meal.  Kinda defeats the purpose, ya know?  t declined and settled upon eating my soup and salad.\n\nI have had the chicken tortilla soup before and usually LOVE it.  However, this time it was barely lukewarm.  Furthermore, the vegetables were so crunchy that I felt like a cow chewing cud with each bite.  I get that some soups have firmer vegetables, but this was a whole different type of crunchy.  Our waitress was nowhere to be found (presumably hiding from us after the appetizer incident), so we asked another server to send it back.  The server informed our waitress about what happened, and they proceeded to LOUDLY discuss how I was just trying to be fussy and that the soup WASN'T cold enough to send back RIGHT BY OUR TABLE.  I'm the customer.  Isn't that up to my discretion?  The soup was room temperature.  To me, that's cold.  And I have to pay, so I expect hot soup.  Period.  I couldn't believe that it was up for discussion, especially within my earshot.\n\nThe manager came over and brought us a free order of croquettes and fruit salad and asked us about the incident.  When I explained about the soup, the manager proceeded to defend the temperature of the soup, the crunchiness of the vegetables, and the behavior of the waitress.  Really??!?!  Oh, so you gave us all this free food to make up for something that apparently wasn't done incorrectly?  The attitude was basically that they were gonna try to satisfy me, but that they really shouldn't because I'm the picky bitch who sent back soup I should have choked down.  Unacceptable service.  \n\nWe paid our bill and left no tip - when I hear a waitress gripe about me to her coworkers, she doesn't deserve a tip.  Yet, it was interesting to watch her rush to our table the second we signed the receipt and stood up.  Heh.  Dream on, crazy waitress.\n\nSteer clear of this place - the service is sub-par.  There are much better places to dine in this city."

Reluctantly she said the wait was fourty minutes. A few minutes later another member of my party showed up. After I said the weight was 40 minutes, she went to go ask again to double check. When she came back she said the hostess rolled her eyes and was sassy when she said the wait was still 40 minutes. They seated us in 40 minutes, I didn't mind the wait because we did have a big party but I thought the service was bad.\nI've been here several times before and I love the ropa vieja sandwich and any of their flavored lemonades. I ordered the ropa vieja sandwich again. It came out in a reasonable time, but it tasted awful. The bread tasted like it was old or like the sandwich was microwaved. Normally the meat is tender but this time it was tough and it almost hurt my jaw to chew it, and certain parts of the sandwich were cold. My raspberry lemon breeze tasted like it was powdery and way too sweet. Our waitress was nice but she didn't come back until it was time for dessert. We ordered a key lime pie. If you like eating straight up sugar, you'll love this dessert. The crust tastes like hardened brown sugar, it melts in your mouth. Which I would like, but it was way too sweet. \nNeedless to say, I'm not sure I will come back to Bahama Breeze. Or at least not with a group or when it's busy. But I'm not sure if I want to pay for rude service and bad food with decent dessert and drinks."

            "review": "It has been a few years since we have eaten here and were looking forward to our favorite sandwiches for lunch. First let me say, that service here is hit or miss. Sometimes it is fabulous. Other times, horrible. There is no in between. This was a horrible time - waitress would not shut up, did not accept that we did not want alcoholic drinks or appetizers and tried to push them on us, she pulled a menu one of my party was holding and started flipping through it, insisted on telling us the \"specials\" despite we knew what we wanted.... anyway - we were looking forward to the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Portabello Mushroom Sandwich. Both were a disappointment - chicken was like rubber, bread tasted bad (not ciabatta anymore). The portabello sandwich was mashed flat as if someone sat on it and the vegetables were diced small and indistinguishable. More so - for a Saturday lunch it was dead... not the normal for this place. Usually it is busy. Looking out the window we got to watch a drunk/high gentleman purusing the parking lot, and then when we left we were confronted by a man who \"wanted to ask us questions\" and when we refused he started swearing, dropping the f-bomb and being obnoxious. It was very unsettling to our group - family members from seniors down to children. The place has not been kept up - although when we entered there was a young girl cleaning the windows, the table was dirty, the ledge where the plants are was full of dust, the menus had food on them. No reason for that. \n\nThe area this restaurant is in has certainly changed tremendously and as well, other restaurants in the area seemed to have changed hands/chains as well. If you are on the Strip, I would advise you to stay there and eat. It is not worth the taxi ride over there and I certainly would not advise you to walk down there from your hotel. \n\nThis used to be a popular place for lunch for the UNLV crowd, and possibly during the week things are different. But don't waste your time."

When I arrived, they were already seated and the Appetizers were coming out.  They ordered Coconut Shrimp (Crispy large Shrimp hand-breaded with sweet flaky Coconut & a Citrus-Mustard dipping Sauce) & Creole Baked Goat Cheese (In roasted Red Bell Peppers served with vine-ripened Tomato Salsa and Parmesan Toast).\n\nThe Coconut Shrimp was OK, not great.  They're large sized Shrimp.....the Coconut Breading was a bit sweet for my tastes.  The Creole Baked Goat Cheese was excellent!  If you try the Goat Cheese, you have to slice up the Bell Pepper and eat it....it was amazingly good.\n\nFor an entree, I ordered the Jerk Chicken Pasta (Jerk Chicken Breast, fresh Asparagus and Mushrooms tossed in a rich Parmesan-Herb Cream Sauce with Bow-Tie Pasta).  They weren't kidding when they said this dish was \"rich\".....I think I gained 5 lbs after eating this thing.....it was very good though.  Despite being rich, the Sauce didn't overwhelm the dish and it had a nice flavor.  The Jerk Chicken was cooked perfectly and was of good quality.....you could taste the flavor that Jerk Chicken is known for....I was left wanting more.  Thank God it wasn't bottomless, otherwise I'd have to buy new clothes afterwards....ha!\n\nOverall, it was good service and good food.  This place is a solid 4 Stars.\n\nReturn Factor - 82%"

            "review": "I have been here a few times and never was the biggest fan, but I will laud Bahama Breeze on my experience today: my friend Susan D. dropped her business card in while at lunch a few weeks ago and won a free happy hour party for 10 people (drinks we had to buy at happy hour prices, which is $3-$4) but it included all sorts of appetizers...and it was seemingly unlimited...for TWO HOURS!  Happy hour is 4-6 PM Monday through Friday, and there are lots of drinks but it looked like only 5 or so choices for apps.  Well, our bartender Melissa hooked it up with more than that and even though there were only 5 of us, she furnished a second round of our faves and almost ordered a third round...of FOOD...and we had to turn her down!\n\nTo drink I had the bahamarita, with strawberry, kiwi and mango slush and margarita on top with a side shot of cactus schnapps...interesting and almost like alcoholic jamba juice.  I tried a variety of apps (beef patties which were really empanadas with creole seasoning, coconut shrimp, spinach dip, chicken wings, and chicken sliders) and they also brought out cheeseburger sliders, chorizo sliders, and pulled pork sliders, none of which I tried.\n\nMy conclusion is this: \n1) a good deal for a free meal,\n2) the empanadas, shrimp, and wings were good, the dip not so much, and\n3) THE CAT IS OUT OF THE BAG: the chicken sliders tasted like MINI CHICK-FIL-A sandwiches!\nI hardly ever eat fried food but I had 4 of these, 2 each round.  Hearty juicy fried white meat chicken, 2 pickle slices, and a tasty bun (that probably has less butter than CFA, a good thing!)\n\nI might die tomorrow but I have to say that after being away from Chick-Fil-A for quite some time, Bahama Breeze solves that craving.  Now if only I can find good waffle fries ever since Caribbean Cooker went out of business.\n\nMoral of this story: Go to Bahama Breeze between 4 and 6, order 1 happy hour priced chicken sliders app and 1 drink for $3 and you will thank me later.  and get Melissa as your bartender, she rocks!"

I was solo so decided to seat at the bar and blend in into the party ambiance, although not planned that way I landed there during happy hour which gave my gift card extra buying power.\nAs I waited patiently at the bar a couple sat by me and were instantly acknowledged and asked if they wanted drinks, they ordered two mojitos and the bartender left to make them, when she came back with their drinks she asked them if they were ready to order, it was then that I realized I have the power of being invisible if no one is looking. I sort of interrupted and asked if I could have a drink and that I was ready to order, she took their order and then took mine giving me that \"can't you wait for your turn? look\"\nI ordered the paella which was very good although not authentic for it was made with long grain rice but the result was the same, a delicious zafron rice dish loaded with seafood! I also got the coconut shrimp with some kind of sweet n sour sauce that was equally delicious as the paella, there are also many more items on the menu that I would love to try like the Jamaican chicken or firecracker shrimp they both sounded good I just didn't have the belly space but I'm working on expanding.\nThe setting is also very nice, the building is like a large plantation house very spacious with high ceilings and nice breezy caribbean atmosphere with indoor and outdoor sections.   \nThe waitress returned to ask the people by my side if everything was ok, they asked her if she could take their picture and I took advantage of the opportunity and asked her for my check hoping not to interrupt a perfect customer waitress relation.\n I'm definitely coming back..what else can I ask for? Awesome fun and clean environment, excellent delicious food and outstanding service...........for the couple sitting next to me!"

My entire mouth was assaulted by salt. \n\nWe tried the West Indies Chicken Curry rice bowl and it was so aggressively salted, we sent it back after 2 bites and then selected the Jerk Chicken Pasta. Unfortunately, that was also crazy salty; I couldn't get another bite in, my tastebuds and mouth were completely ruined and shriveled up.\n\nThe flavor profile of each dish was also shockingly basic - It didn't offer up any of the Caribbean flavors or seasonings that were promised. The Jamaican jerked chicken was dried out and I didn't even taste much jerk seasoning - only salt. To be fair, the dinner entree portions were gigantic. One dish is perfect for 3 people to share. \n\nAlso, the appetizers were average. We tried the chicken empanadas and they were extremely doughy with minimal filling. The only dish that was decent was the fried coconut shrimp appetizer, however, I have to explicitly state that Elephant Bar and Yard-House makes it better. \n\nThe manager came to talk to us at the end and was very defensive about the salt usage in both dishes. He also offended us by suggesting that we probably didn't know what jerk seasoning tasted like. lol. I'm not even going to argue it. We ended up heading to In-N-Out and grabbing some burgers after this failed dinner."

I had drinks, an appetizer, entree, and desert. \n\nDrinks:\nFrozen Bahamarita - delicious\nUltimate Pina Colada - just OK. I wish it was in a bigger class\n\nFor an appetizer I had the Adobo Chicken Taco. It was good. I liked how it had a little crunchiness to it. It was a little cold though\n\nMy entree was the Island Hopper and included onion rings, conch fritters, coconut shrimp, and Jamaican jerk wings.\n\nI ate half an onion ring, nothing special about those since I cannot stand the taste of onions. The conch fritters should really be called conch balls. I love fried conch from this local place in Miami so that was the main reason why I decided to go with this meal, I was disappointed. They were not horrible but could have been seasoned more and they barely had any conch in them. The coconut shrimp was standard though most of the seasoning was on the outside and not the shrimp itself. Being Jamaican I always go for things that are jerked. These wings were not jerked at all. No spice or kick to them. The sauces that came with the food were soooo good!!!\n\nFor desert I had the Banana Nut Bread Supreme. It was delicious. The only negative was the stale, warm, soggy banana slice.\n\n\nI will definitely be returning"

It watered the whole thing down. My opening cocktail was a minty lime water.\n\nAppetizer of West Indies beef patty was delicious. You could probably buy them in bulk at Costco. The mango salsa served with it was also tasty (I usually don't like mango salsa)\n\nChicken and steak skewers were ok, but there was nothing very Bahamian about them - served with grilled peppers and mushrooms. The rice/beans served beneath the skewers were dry.\n\nOur server was a really nice guy. He recommended my drink, but I didn't have the heart to complain about it.\n\nIt's a chain restaurant, meaning not truly ethnic. Can someone recommend a sweet hole-in-the-wall?"

So we visited a few other places in Las Vegas, then ended at Bahama Breeze where mom wanted Paella. She says other than in Spain, Bahama Breeze makes the best Paella! So we ordered salad, which, by the way, was delicious with an array of cold, crisp vegetables with a dynamite vinaigrette, and two orders of Paella enough to serve four people. We even took some home since we couldn't finish it all. A family member and I ordered a glass of the Merlot which was a nice compliment to our meal. There was no room for dessert! Next time for sure. Definitely worth the trip. Will do this day trip thing again this summer. It was fun! Bahama Breeze is high on the \"do over\" list!"

Our daughter had the Jamaican Jerk chicken with ripe plantains rice and black beans; she was in heaven and ditch the fork in order to enjoy the chicken to the fullest. Grandma had the grilled chicken sandwich which she reported there were no extra frills so it was just good.  Somehow we managed to have enough room for dessert and are now in a very delighted sureene sugar state of being.

I saw that they have happy hour and was finally able to go with my sister and her BF. \n\nLots of parking and a really great environment with live music. We weren't in the main dining room, but we were in the room with the live music and beachy feel which was great. I enjoyed the atmosphere. \n\nOur server took a while to come by, she might have been on break or something. By the time she came, we had already looked over the menu and knew what we wanted to order. Our food came out quickly after we placed our order.\n\nLobster and shrimp quesadilla: unfortunately it was our least favorite dish. I didn't get to taste much lobster and I felt it was lacking some flavor or spice.\n\nCoconut shrimp: their most popular appetizer but it wasn't crispy enough for me. It was pretty good but I was hoping for a stronger coconut flavor. My sister loved this dish. \n\nSeared ahi tuna: 5/5!!! I could eat an entire plate (or 2) but unfortunately I had to share. The ahi tuna tasted fresh and the salad went very well with it. The mango glaze wasn't over powering either. \n\nHabanero chicken wings: we probably should have ordered the Jamaican jerk wings. While the portion was really big, we did not enjoy the wings. It was spicy but the BBQ and habanero didn't mix very well IMO. \n\nI had been wanting a frozen bahamarita all day and it did not disappoint me. I'm pretty sensitive to alcohol and yes... I'm one of THOSE people who get super red after half a shot but I managed to finish my entire drink without getting tomato red. Drinks here seem to be watered down because I also tried my sisters classic margarita and it didn't taste like it had any alcohol in it! I loved it but she did not. \n\nThe next I come back, I'll be ordering their seared ahi tuna again and I'll be trying their empanadas"

Place was hoppin'!  Very, very busy.  Folks must like their congo music, eh?  Breezy.  Luckily even with no reservations our wait time for a table was less than five minutes.  Like the place - open, airy, noisy, and boy do I love the smell of Jerk chicken on the grills.  I'm really hoping that it's cooked on an open charcoal flame, but I'm pretty sure it's probably not.  Can't have everything I suppose.\n\nAfter getting seated and giving our drink order (Bahama Breeze using bottles of Republic of Tea - Ginger Peach is tasty but a tad pricy) we were ready to view the menu.  It really is a bit of a mix, some Jamaican, some Caribbean, some American.  Fortunately a lot of it sounded tasty.\n\nWifey couldn't decide so she settled on the Island Hopper ($19.99) - appetizer sampler platter of sorts that included their signature Jamaican chicken wings, crispy coconut shrimp, onion rings, and conch fritters.  It came with sauce sides of jerk BBQ sauce, citrus mustard, and a roasted pineapple chutney.  For the most part she enjoyed it.  The Jamaican chicken wings were a bit smaller than she remembered but they were still very tasty with a peppery kick.  Coconut shrimp were indeed crispy, but light, with good hints of sweet when dipped in the pineapple chutney.  Conch fritters were only OK, a bit forgetful because they tasted more of a hush puppy with very little conch inside.  And the onion rings, well they were just onion rings.\n\nI ended up getting the Cuban Sandwich ($10.99) and while I did like it, I should have read the menu better.  Why does Bahama Breeze put lettuce & tomato in a Cuban sandwich??  And salami???  Very, very strange.  Just do it like the Cubans guys - marinated roasted pork, good ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard between buttered Cuban bread then smooshed in a plancha till golden brown.  Simple!  Thank you Jon Favreau of Iron Man and Chef fame!  I think I would have enjoyed this sandwich a lot more without the extra fluff, but did applaud the effort of Bahama Breeze trying to make the sandwich their own.  Next time I would just order it with no lettuce & tomato, or just put it on the side.\n\nOverall a good experience at Bahama Breeze, the atmosphere was inviting, and the service was stellar without being pretentious.  The food could use some tweaking but that's par for the course.  If this place wasn't so far from where we live I would be likely to check out their menu further or at least come down for their hoppin' Happy Hour.\n\nJamaican me crazy!"

But after getting over the fact there is really no authentic food here this place is pretty good. We had a party of around 30 and were seated privately in a covered patio section of restaurant. This place is huge, nice and spacious. Seemed like everyone really enjoyed their drinks, I had the Bahamarita and it was very good. Ok so menu items we tried were beef empanadas: their version is good and the sauces that came with were very good. Coconut shrimp: I have had better but it was good, the sauce to dip was the winner. BBQ ribs: very good like rib joint good, Seafood and jerk pasta I was told was excellent, plenty of shrimp and lobster. The portions here are pretty big too, most guests had to go bags. I found out after the fact from a local that the one authentic item they had was conch fritters, man one of my favorites so can't wait to try them.

God Bless my mother and my aunts for their hard work in putting this thing on and for keeping everyone else patient while this disaster was taking place.  This was by far the worst6 display of service I have ever seen and several formal letters are being sent to their corporate office as I write this.  \n\nMy family had made arrangements with their business office to hold our reunion here for a buffet-style dinner.  We do not live in Las Vegas (none of us do) so we did everything via fax and phone.  We have been to this location on several occasions over the years, so we are familiar with the food and always had really good service here.  I also always enjoyed the food, so we thought this would be the perfect place to host our family reunion dinner.  Anyway, so the contract we made was for three main entrees (seafood paella, baby back ribs and Jamaican grilled chicken) , three side dishes (yellow rice, green beans, creamed sweet potatoes) and their signature green salad.  This was all to be served buffet-style with unlimited choice of soft drinks, tea/coffee and iced tea. The price negotiated was $35 per person.  We brought in our own cakes for dessert which they kept in the back refrigerated for us.  This was a group of approximately 31 people.  Kids' menu items were to be paid for separately as well as cocktails, beer and wine. Each table would get their own bill for those things separately (and for anything else you want on the regular menu).\n\nFrom the beginning, service problems began.  There were two servers who primarily came in our area.  Over the course of the evening, we had to literally chase these people down for drinks and just basic service.  It was horrible.  I noticed that the buffet serving containers were quite small for the amount of people in party and they emptied very quickly.  Nobody was there to replace to food.  People sat with food while others had to wait a long time before being able to get food.  The salad bowl probably could serve about 6 to 8 people, so when that emptied (no other food was out or available at this point), people just sat their for a good 20 minutes before they brought out more.  This was the ongoing theme of the night.  Need a refill on that ice tea? Be prepare to never get it unless you run around trying to find the waiter to get some.  Nobody was attending to our party.  Nobody was busing the plates so we literally had pile them in the middle table.  Kids' orders were not brought out in a timely manner so the kids were eating like an hour into dinner service.  Remember the tea and coffee? None was offered to anyone and we paid for it!  And to top off , when the staff did make an appearance, they had really nasty attitudes about it.  No apologies.  So where was the manager in all this? Certainly not rolling up his sleeves trying to help his clearly overwhelmed waitstaff.  He was somewhere else, making excuses that there were other big parties going on.  NOT OUR PROBLEM.  \n\nLook, this was clearly an understaffed event and the lack of attention to ANY sort of detail shows that, but come on! It was just blatantly bad.  Poor attitude and unapologetic staff is just a reflection of the management's nonchalance for literally pissing all over this party.  We had babies crying from hunger, we had piled up dirty plates, plenty of empty glasses and annoyed family members.  Thank goodness we are good spirited people, kept the party going and did our raffles and announcements and passed out cake as planned. We tried not to let our experience at Bahama Breeze ruin our getting to catch up with each other and have fun, but damn! Work with us here! We could have just gone to a buffet at one of the casinos for this and we probably should have.\n\n Oh and I haven't even gotten to how salty the food was!  The paella was nearly inedible even though they did not skimp on seafood, does it matter if they pour a whole container of salt in it?  Dry chicken, hard to cut with my knife.  However, the ribs were decent as were the green beans and sweet potatoes..but wait..something was missing.  Mom did not realize this until after but they forgot our yellow rice.  We have a few people in our party who are allergic to seafood so the paella was out, hence the reason for the yellow rice side.  I guess everything else was so bad we forgot about the missing side. Anyway, my mom called their business office and got it refunded.  Either way, I could think of sooo many other places to host a dinner like this that would have gone so much smoother.  They really should be ashamed for doing such a sloppy-ass job."

We got there just after 9 and it was fairly empty. I requested to sit outside because it was 80 outside but felt nice. We were seated in the \"outside\" with an AC unit blasting on us. I get cool easily so I wasn't loving it. We ordered 2 Pina Coladas, nachos, a burger and side Salad.  The drinks were good, good flavor but took a while to come. The food was out so quickly it was amazing. The burger was decent, as my fiance said it's hard to mess up a burger. The ceaser salad was, meh, limp lettuce and way to much dressing. The nachos were disappointing. Not enough chip to topping ratio, the salsa was a little bit meh too. Overall we didn't spend much because of the happy hour and we left full. We decided we wouldn't be back unless it was just for drinks because the food wasn't that great."

I absolutely love coming to Bahama Breeze!\n\nMy girls and I frequent this place. We planned a Secret Santa gift exchange and planned to come here. I called ahead of time to see if they can help us remain anonymous with our gifts. They allowed us to bring in our gifts and keep them at the front desk. When the time came, they wheeled all the gifts and handed them out to who they were supposed to go to. So awesome. They made our party fun. \n\nOne lady who works there, I want to say her name is Denise, but I could be wrong. She is great! Every time we're there, she's there and comes to say hi, When we met her, we had found out our friend was moving overseas, so we were upset. Then when we came back for her going away, she was there too and stopped by. She even remembered the night we all had tears in out eyes. \n\nI love the food here! The firecracker shrimp and jerk shrimp are my favorite. I like my food with a little kick and these deliver. Firecracker shrimp comes with a really good dipping sauce, while the jerk shrimp comes with Cuban bread. Also love their drinks! I get the Frozen Bahamarita. I recently tried the specialty rum drink they had, and got a souvenir glass. \n\nFor my birthday, I had planned on coming here for lunch after some activities. After telling my mom, she later told me that they were going to take me there for dinner! lol they know where to take me, that;s for sure. \n\nSome nights they have live music, but there are always different parties going on.I really enjoy coming here because the food is good, staff are friendly and I always have a great time coming here."

Unfortunately, there isn't any tables out here big enough for your group.\"  We tell him no problem and sit us wherever there is room.\n\nHe takes us back inside to the room behind the bar and sits us at a table that is set for 4 people, but enough room for 5.\n\nWe ordered a handful of appetizers and each of us ordered entrees.

We had to wait almost 40 min for a table for 4 at an almost empty restaurant. We were seated at around 10:30 pm. \n\nTo be fair - the food was not bad. What was most upsetting is that I ordered the rice bowl with shrimp & fish. A few bites in, I bit into something hard. I thought it was a fish bone but it was a sharp jagged piece of a plastic - probably the remnants of a food container about an inch long and wide. I told the server & she asked if I wanted my dish replaced and I said no as I did not want to wait for another plate at that time of night as our kids were very tired. She showed the plastic object to her manager & I was waiting to see what he/she would say or do. Well the disappointing outcome is they did nothing. No apology from the manager & we got charged for my dish. Very disappointing.  \n\nThis is not the first time we have found unwelcome objects in our food at restaurants. In fact once at BJ's my sons Mac & Cheese had the corner of a plastic bag in it but we did not say anything as it was large enough to see & not harmful. The sever saw it as she collected the plates & reported it to the manager. She came to our table to apologize & said we would not be charged for the dish. \n\nSo to the manager of the Bahama Breeze - your management skills need some fine tuning to say the least. Your food quality control obviously needs some work. It's not OK to find sharp plastic objects in our food & it's especially not OK for you to ignore it. Very disappointing."

Me and my friend figured that since the parking lot was full at 2pm on a Friday afternoon...the food must be pretty good. We decided to order our food To-Go and the hostess was very helpful offering some recommendations. We order and we sit around chatting and people watching. After 15 minutes, our food is ready!\n\nI ordered the Oak Grilled Chicken Sandwich with lettuce, tomato and goat cheese on Ciabatta bread....AMAZING! The chicken was tender and juicy and well seasoned. The cheese was slightly melted and the lettuce and tomato were fresh and tasty! I ordered the tomato, basil and balsamic vinegarette salad on the side. I ate that on the way back to the resort so fast..I couldnt really tell you how it tasted...so I assume it was good. After the sandwich and and ice cold beer, I slept for hours :) \n\nBahama Breeze?? You have a satisfied customer here! Now...build a restaurant in Virginia/DC area please!!"

I'm having trouble thinking of any bad things to say about this place.\n\nLocated off the strip near the Hard Rock Hotel, Bahama Breeze was a delightful place from beginning to end.\n\nOur server was friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Seafood Paella without the sausage, which our server said could be done.  One of the chefs came out a few moments later and said that the paella was made with the sausage in it and that they would be picking it out, which was fine with me so long as there wasn't any sausage actually on my plate.  I really appreciate this gesture because I know that not a lot of vegetarians would be cool with that.  When it came, I devoured it, which wasn't easy because it was a big plate of food.\n\nMy wife had the Fresh Pan-Seared Salmon Pasta, which was also amazing!\n\nWe had a couple of their specialty mixed drinks, which are not on the on-line menu so I don't recall the names.  But they were also very tasty.\n\nSeems to me like most of the good food in Vegas is off the strip, and this would be a perfect example.  \n\nWe shall return!"

For all those looking for a restaurant that has a great atmosphere, excellent service and bomb food, you have to try this place.\n\nHappy hour at this place is worth the money!!! But when its not happy hour, its still worth coming to no matter what. Let me recommend a few things on the menu:\n\nHabanero Wings- OH MAN, I don't eat a lot of spicy food but this one is so delicious! It has a mix of a sour cream and pico de gallo dipping sauce. All I can say is all the flavors is like a party in your mouth! I was cleaning up the bone and I never do that lol! The blend is perfect! This is a MUST ORDER when coming here! \n\nJerk Chicken- Love the seasoning on this. I know they marinade it overnight and put it in the frier to give it a lil crunch. Lemme tell you this, they know how to season this to perfection. Love the sauce to add too, its a touch of sweetness. The combination together is like heaven\n\nBeef Empanadas- Great starter, ALWAYS good to order before the food is coming, they use the same sauce for the habanero wings. Still, the pairing is always perfect when it comes to their sauces and food.\n\nCalypso Shrimp Linguine- All the flavors pop in this dish. My 3 yr old son who is a picky eater will share this with me. The portion size is enough to feed me, my 3 yr old and my 8 yr old. This is a popular dish at this place, I've ordered this numerous times coming here. \n\nJerk Chicken Pasta- YUM!!! it may not look as appetizing when you see the plate but DANG this one is a must order also. My husband would order this when we would come here until he discovered the....\n\nChicken Breast with Cilantro Crema- you have to eat each bite with the chicken, mash potatoes and the sauce. You will be craving this.\n\nFor Dessert: Order the Banana But Bread Supreme- you will not be disappointed!!!!! \n\nCan't go wrong with this place, you will never leave disappointed. The ONLY thing I don't like is that every time we arrive, we are always greeted by a homeless person asking for some money. Seriously EVERY SINGLE visit. Other than that, I have no complaints!"

The restaurant is bigger than I thought with many sections. \n\nI scrolled through Yelp to search for references of what to order. My family end up ordered Cheese Curds (cheese stuffed fried yucca) Jamaican Jerky Chicken, Seafood Paellas, a stack of Short Ribs BBQ, Cheddar Burger and fries sweet plantain. We loved the Cheese Curds. They were crunchy, cheese oozed delicious. We ended up with two orders of that. The Jamaican Jerky Chicken was delicious, the portion was huge! Half a chicken grilled with special sauce and yellow rice with fried sweet plantains. The plantains were thick cut and fried to perfection. We Cubans loved it. The Seafood Paellas were not that great. The consistency wasn't really true Paella but the flavor was there. The seafood wasn't as fresh, mussels slightly overcooked, though fish was flaky and cooked well. Paellas weren't impressive, average, but portion was also very big! Each can easily feed two people. My sister-in-law's burger was good (you can't go wrong with burger they should all taste how they should taste). My BBQ ribs were ok, again, they tasted just like how should taste. Sweet and smokey. There wasn't any special twist or spin added onto it. \n\nOverall the experience was meh. With the bill $120 in total, we expected more. It was filling but wasn't satisfying. I heard good things about it, but maybe we ordered the wrong things because everything was just ok."

My local friends wanted to meet here for Happy Hour.  \n\nI got here around 4:30 on a Monday.  I really love being able to just park and walk up in Vegas. Eating on the strip is a whole process of parking and walking through casinos... that's like a wasted 20 minutes there, another 20 back.  A place like this, nice and easy.  \n\nThe layout is great.  It goes for a Caribbean/Cuban feel, especially outside, without feeling cheesy.  Nice shutters on the enclosed patio area, warm air coming in, sunny... just a very relaxed atmosphere where you really don't feel like you're in Vegas.  I felt like I was on vacation, actually, which sounds cheesy but it's true.  The restaurant was pretty open, though, but it was a weekday.  \n\nNow, the food...\n\nHappy Hour is an amazing deal.  It's like $5-something per dish and beers and drinks are from $2-$3....!?  What... the... hell!  So good.   \n\nWe were starving so we got almost one of everything; the jerk chicken, pork sliders, burger sliders, empandas, quesadilla, coconut shrimp, etc.  Everything was great.  My friends were a little hesitant about the jerk chicken because it was black, due to the rub, but it was great.   My friends had a pineapple coconut martini (great), mojito (they loved it, had real sugar cane), I had a hefeweizen.   \n\nSo basically, you can't miss at Happy Hour - everything was great.\n\nThis is a small detail that I really appreciate. In the men's bathroom, they have mouthwash dispensers. It's a great touch because, let's be honest, your breath after eating isn't going to be the best so this is a great way to hit the reset button. \n\nIt was just a fun, casual experience... it really felt like we weren't in Vegas, but on vacation."

Service was speedy, both in seating and in getting our food.  Our server was Sam and she was quite pleasant and knowledgeable, even joking around with me after I made some of my usual sarcastic comments.  I had asked her what was good here and what she'd recommend and, when she told me, I said that I'd trust her and that it would be her fault if my dinner wasn't great...all the time with a smirk on my face.  It turns out that she was right.  One of her recommendations was the seafood paella.  It was the first time I'd had paella and it was awesome!  She asked me later on why I hadn't left her any so that she could have some dinner that night and I said that it was just too good to leave behind.  We both chuckled and she said she was glad to hear it.  The pina colada I had was really good, but stir it up first.  Most of the rum goes in first and is then swirled in with the rest of the drink which resembled a very thick milkshake's consistency.  Yum!  I can easily see myself returning to this restaurant the next time I'm in Vegas."

I go off on the dude because i just want to get two drinks and carry them the 2 feet from the bar to the table right behind me, but he refused to do this cause it wasn't fair to the server. What a bunch of degenerates at this chain hell. The manager came over and eventually offered to buy me 2 drinks, but hell no because he defended his erver.

They have an awesome menu as well that has something for just about everyone. My girlfriend never orders anything but the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Pasta, which comes in a huge portion that can be shared or taken home for a second meal. I myself love the Steak Oscar, which is an 8 oz sirloin topped with buttery crab meat. How can you beat that?! They also have a great happy hour for those who are lucky enough to work close to the Strip but luckily, there is a reverse happy hour that starts at 9 as well."

Then again, id probably spend my rent money eating there all the time.  \n\nThe Service: Is always wonderful. Haven't had a bad experience yet.  The staff is always helpful and pleasant.  So cheers to them!\n\nThe Atmosphere: Wonderful!  For someone who has been to the \"islands\" this place is a good representation.  From the ceiling fans to the music being played.  Not loud, but mellow music.  Helps the food go down better... screw the sugar.\n\nThe Food:  OMG! Even if everything else was horrible the Food is so good you'd ignore it.\n\nJerk Chicken- my mouth is watering just thinking of them.  They have the perfect amount of jerk flavoring and are fried or baked to perfection.  Crispy on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside.  We made a mistake of sharing an order. Bad idea.  These are too good to share.\n\nBeef Patties- Yummy! If flavor and good food aren't you thing... steer clear of this option. Truly a mouth satisfying appetizer.\n\nSeafood Paella-So I have had Paella at a number of locations and this is one of the best.  The whole dish is a burst of happiness in your mouth.  I've had this 2 of the last 3 times I went here.  Everything else just doesn't seem to catch my eye.....\n\nAlways too full for dessert..... maybe next time."

The asparagus and mushrooms work very well with the spices of the chicken and the pasta sauce. The husband loves the chicken salad, and the burgers here are also very good.

We are slightly new to Las Vegas and I was really craving a burger..like from Chilies or somewhere like that but we neeeed to be trying new places! I remebered driving by Bahama Breeze and hearing good things about it from people. We sat in the bar and we were gonna order a drink but because it was 106degrees outside...we ended up drinking down lots and lots of water. I went for the portabello/manchanga cheese burger and he went for the Cuban Sandwich which made me happy so we could share. I usually lovve any and most syles of the cuban sandwhich. I skipped fries and went for the black bean soup as my side, which was actually delish; they put a splash of some yummy green salsa on top that made this soup perfect. I did try my boyfreind's fris and they were OK, nothing too special but average and tasty. The burger was good, the mushroom and cheese mix on top was awesome! It was very messy tho and I had to cut it in half of course as my his sandwhich came out cut in half and verrry bit. I enjoyed my sandwhich, I just hate when it falls all apart and is all over the place because then I am not getting the full effect of the flovors together. I was eying his sandwhich and finally took a bite, I was not impressed at all....it was slightly dry and was in need of a special mustard of some kind (honey, spicy..something..), it might of had some mayo on it but it just tasted dry, the bread was OK...it was more of a mixed meat pannini sandwhich if you ask me. He did enjoy it but mainly because he was dipping it in his ranch. I actually brought half of it for lunch to work today, added some honey mustard and it was pretty good. The decore in this place is fun, reminds me of Rain Forest Cafe. I would say it is an affordable, family-friendly place that is OK for the food. Our server was great, no issues there. I did see the happy hour menu and will FOR SURE go in for that some time soon but probably just that...1/2 off apps. and cheap fancy drinks. I think it is only Sun-Thurs though. I am looking forward to hitting the happy hour  but think it is more of a family-friendly place with OK food and funky fish/jungle decore."

One recommendation that is a have to if you like this place: sign up to get their emails.  Once or twice a year, they have free parties.  You can RSVP for up to five people.  They serve free food and drink.  The last one, they only gave you one free drink (in the past it was unlimited).  BUT I won a gift card to come back and dine.\nFor regular dinning, the coconut shrimp or the seafood paella.  Yum!"

The shrimp and crab with the toasted bread was above mediocre. The coconut shrimp was amazing and so was their fried shrimp. The baby back ribs was falling off the bone tender and my 3 year old ate one after another. The jerk chicken taste way better than it looks. The nachos were a classic fave. I know you are reading this and must be like wow this girl eats a lot but FYI I'm pregnant so I have a big appetite. The singer played and sang me Happy Birthday and he sings great music. The waitresses were on point, friendly, and nice. The only thing that could've made this experience better was if my husband was there but I understand he had to work. Someone has to make money but I definitely would go here again and my sister loved it so much she wants to come here on her Birthday. Oh and last but not least the mango beach drink is to die for! Best drink I ever had(non alcoholic)"

We also had the chicken wings and they were flavorful and finger licking good:-)\n\nThe mojitos are by far the best mojitos that I have EVER had and I've had lots and lots of mojitos!!! They had just enough sugar and mint and they had a pretty good kick to them, not to mention they were only $4.00 (during HH). Did I mention they had a pretty good kick:-) They were so good, we went back the next day, just for the mojitos (and not during HH - they were $7.00 each). \n\nFor our main entrees, we ordered buttermilk fried chicken breast..OMG this dish is delish!!!!It's a layered dish of mashed potatoes, chicken breast, topped with spinach onions and cheese, and then layered again with another chicken breast and potatoes. On the side, the dish also included corn and black beans drenched in a wonderful sauce.  It sounds like alot and it is, don't worry about that, get a to go box if you have to. This dish is awesome and a must to try. I would order it again in a heartbeat. \n\nThe atmosphere is nice (tropical theme) and the waitstaff was friendly and accommodating. \n\nGreat job Bahama Breeze!"

We eventually ended up at Bahama Breeze, and it was honestly a great experience. I have been here a handful of times before and have always enjoyed it. I really love their late night happy hour, although we could not take advantage of that last night because it was a Saturday, oh well. Without a doubt my absolute favorite thing about this place is that every single item from drinks to food to dessert has the CALORIE COUNT on the menu! This is super helpful for me since I log all of my calories daily. I chose the Painkiller cocktail which was delicious, for dinner I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich on a brioche bun for only 400 calories, and I added avocado which was a generous portion and perfectly ripe. My choice of side was the Vine Ripened Tomato Salad which came in a balsamic dressing and was very good as well. I also ordered a glass of Cabernet and it was great. My friends had the Shrimp and Grits which looked incredible, and a steak with mashed potatoes which was perfectly cooked, and a nice looking Caeser Salad and Clam Chowder. I would have liked to order a dessert but there was nothing even remotely low in calories lol. Service was great and we were all pleased with our meals, and I like that they are open until midnight every night."

However, I sometimes take chances when there is something I have a craving for. One recent night, I went to Bahama Breeze (http://www.bahamabreeze.com) because I wanted their West Indies Patties. The friend I was dining with can't eat spicy food so she asked our waiter Jay for a sample of their jerk sauce  but Jay didn't know  how spicy the sauce was so he went and got a sample for her and the chef Dan Strohecker came with him. Since the chef was at the table I figured I would ask if they use the same oil to cook everything. Dan said he couldn't guarantee that they didn't but especially when a rush comes on. He graciously offered to cook the patties in new oil for me in a skillet. I was floored because that has NEVER happened in any restaurant I have ever eaten at. He said they will do anything within reason to ensure their guest enjoy themselves and any allergy issues are addressed.  I thanked him and he went and got started on my patties. Jay brought them to the table and a short time later Dan came back and asked me how they were and he looked down and laughed cuz the plate was empty. He said there's my answer! He said he had never cooked them that way before and didn't know if they would turn out light and crunchy like they do when fried in the deep fryer. I told him not only were they light but the crunch was unbelieveable. Not too hard and not to soft. Just perfect! I thanked him again and told him I would tell all my friends and blog about it. Bahama Breeze is one of the more successful restaurants in Las Vegas and now I know why! The food is exceptional but the service and attention to customers is phenomenal! Beyond anything I have ever experienced before. They are better than 5 star in my book. When you are there, tell Dan what a wonderful chef he is and request Jay as your waiter. You won't be disappointed at all!"

But the last few visits I have ordered something from the fresh fish menu.\n\nOur last visit was on a Saturday night and we sat in the indoor patio area. They had a gentleman playing live music for our entire stay. The music did not drown out our conversation, but you should request another seat if you would like a more peaceful environment. \n\nFor drinks, we had the Yaka Hula Hickey Dula and the Painkiller. Both cocktails were strong but nice mixes with kick from the rum. They were too strong for my wife, so that meant two dinner cocktails for me. I had the sauteed tilapia with chimichurri sauce as my entree. My wife had a turkey burger. My fish was cooked perfectly, moist and flaky with the chimichurri being a nice accompaniment.

And their HH includes food items as well. \n\nThis BB is way bigger here in Vegas than the one in Jacksonville. Bigger restaurant means bigger decor and displays inside. Pretty standard dim lighting and Caribbean decor. We came on a Friday and surprisingly it was not busy at all. They had a small dj at the outside patio playing hip hop music that did not seem to fit the theme for the restaurant but the inside music was more fitting and appropriate to the island theme. \n\nThey have a wide variety menu all incorporating an island type theme and taste, but I love how their menu is separated and really makes selection an easy task. \n\nI'm a sucker for their establishment favorite the Coconut Shrimp. I think I get it every time as an appetizer! The crispy coconut batter on the butterfly shrimps are fried to perfection and that citrus mustard dipping sauce is almost like a marmalade glaze. Not too sweet tho and that mustard almost like a Dijon flavor gives it a nice kick! Definitely one of my fav dishes here. \n\nMy family was having seafood this night (we refrain from meat on Fridays during Lent) and this place has lots of seafood options, well lots of options period. We had the Key West Shrimp and Grits, Calypso Shrimp Linguine, the Fish Tacos, and the Island Hopper (it comes with jerk chicken but we just saved it to bring home). \n\nThe shrimp and grits was good, but I wish there was more grits that came with the dish. But the garlic light cream sauce on the shrimp was good and not too heavy, just right. The green beans at accompanied the dish were good, just needed a dab on pepper. \n\nThe calypso shrimp linguine was the best tasting of the 4 main dishes we ordered. My sisters dish so I can only comment on that I tried a little bit of it, but it was enough and tasted good enough that when I go back I want that to be my order!! It's like a light pink sorta sauce, white cream sauce but with the Caribbean flavors and spices it turns it sorta pink ish. Every good and sauce was not too heavy at all. \n\nMy dad had fish tacos accompanied by fries and guacamole. The guc was really good but the tacos shells were a bit too hard. \n\nThe island hopper actually is listed as an appetizer, but mom got it as a main entre\u00e8.  Comes with coconut shrimp, coconut batter covered onion rings, shrimp stuffed hush puppies and jerk chicken. The onion rings were good and the coconut batter adds a nice twist of flavor. The hush puppies also very good. I like that they were not too dense, and nice a light almost fluffy. The dish also comes with the citrus mustard and a pineapple chutney - which also tasted like a sweet with a kick pineapple marmalade or glaze!! You can eat the chutney straight, it's so yummy. \n\nAlso the bathrooms are big and nice and I like how the have little mouthwash cups and mouthwash available at the sink so if you're going out straight after dinner, that least you good on the breath check \n\nThe place is a chain restaurant, so you get what you expect, but it's great food, reasonable pricing, appropriate for special occasions but not going to blow your wallet like if you were to eat somewhere on strip in Las Vegas and probably get less quantity. It's a good vibes sorta place and the service is good!! S/O to our server Matt for taking good care of us!! \n\nSolid good dining restaurant and I will be back! Yay"

See, I've been to this Bahama Breeze a couple times before, because I discovered it's a place I can get a bowl of some really yummy chicken tortilla soup, complete with freshly sliced cubes of avocado. And, it's certainly nice to dine in a restaurant void of video poker machines and giant flat screens displaying every single game you can bet on. The decor's nice -- they certainly did an excellent job of creating the outside indoors. The service, plain and simple, is just nothing to write home about. Or write about at all. Last night, I met up with a group of friends there for dinner, and they seated us on the patio. Why the patio was even open, I have no idea. Even with the heater towers, we were freezing. The hostess relocated us, and it took quite a while for our orders to be taken, and took days for our food to arrive, without so much as an explanation or apology. In fact, our server completely disappeared after our orders were taken. A food runner delivered our plates. I did notice, however, that the complaining stopped once we did receive our meals. The food certainly is pretty darn tasty, and the presentation impressive. I'm just going to convince myself that it's been the luck of the draw as far as service has gone on my previous experiences, and give it one more try.\n\nSure do love that soup. ,': )"

To start off the night we ordered some frozen bahamaritas and appetizers. Warm spinach, artichokes and cheese, with a hint of nutmeg. It hit the spot. As for dinner, I ordered the Seafood Paella with seafood, chicken, sausage and peas with yellow rice. OMG...you can't go wrong with this dish. For dessert we shared he warm chocolate pineapple upside down cake. It reminded me when I was back in the Caribbean.  yum-yum in my tum.  Our waiter was awesome.  He always topped off our drinks and was very attentive."

He's been a vegetarian for five years!! Luckily he noticed and sent it back, which left whole table preoccupied with when the waitress will come back to check on us and bring back the meal. Then the manager came by a very uncomfortable, aggressive and disingenuous apology. They didn't even have the class to take it off the bill! Oh and no complimentary bday desert either. Going there was a huge mistake."

I decided to try their new hummus appetizer.\n\nIt came out VERY thing and served with some sliced veggies and some crispy pita bread sorta thing.  The side items were very good, and I did actually like the hummus but it needed more carribean kick in the flavor and not be so thin and bland.\n\nI tried their new Shrimp and 4 cheese grits.  The dish was made perfect and so were the grits but again everything was bland. It needs more kick in the flavor dept.  \n\nThe pineapple upside down chocolate cake was soooooooooo yummmy though.  Their seafood chowder is always good, and I've had their black beans and fish tacos many times and it is definitely yummmy.  \n\nI will definitely keep coming back to this place again.  I just prefer more spice/flavor in my dishes. (spice doesn't mean spicy, just fyi)"

Nasty nasty nasty. \n\nThe visit I'm commenting on was about a month ago.

I would prefer more of the roasted corn. The combination of the cilantro cream and corn work very well together. The Chicken wings are quite good as well.

My son had the tilapia, which I was grateful to see on the kids menu. \n\nSummer is reggae time. I wish we knew this Saturday night. They have a 5 piece Jamaican band Saturdays, but we missed it. There was a live musician though, who was fun and friendly. Loved the music and the atmosphere at this place. \n\nThe Bahamarita was fun and delicious. Even better, they have a virgin version, which made my daughter's night. \n\nWhen my daughter melted down and wanted to leave immediately (it was late), Fred was super fast getting us out the door. This goes a long way in my book."
