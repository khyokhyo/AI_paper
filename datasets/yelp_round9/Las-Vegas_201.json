            "review": "By far and large one of the best surprises I've had in a long time. Fantastic Italian food, a superb atmosphere which feels more like going to a friend's kitchen, and most excellent service. The gnocchi w/Sunday sauce, the lasagna, and the carbonara were incredible and all authentic. \n\nThe pastas were all freshly made in house and were also fantastic. We finished our extraordinary meal with freshly made cannolis (the shells and the stuffing were made in-house), tiramisu (very light as it should be and with a hint of Marsala), and espresso - all of which continued to prove this place is a phenomenal find. The server had decent knowledge of wine pairings and was spot on with service in all aspects.\n\nThe bottom line about the place is if you're in Vegas, even if on vacation, this place is worth the drive and the time to find as it is by far and large a more pleasant experience than the overpriced and overhyped restaurants on the strip."

I just ordered the spaghetti & meatballs and it is literally the best I've ever had. Started off with the House salad, also very tasty. Not a cheap dinner, but worth every penny. Good service, too."

And those are the words of someone who made his own roast beefs as a kid working in the deli.  Our dinner Saturday night was with my in-laws all 8 of them who not only loved the food but the service by our waiter and the chef for our autistic son was phenomenal.   Thank you!"

But wait it doesnt stop there. It would also come home a glorified war hero and help rebuild the American Economy and finally just FINALLY get rid of all today's shitty ass music and possibly resurrect Tupac...\n\nAnyway i never been here before but often hear the raves of Chef Marc and how totally awesome is it. Lately i've been hankering for some good Italian food. So i set up a UYE http://www.yelp.com/biz/tien-hosted-a-uye-uye-at-parma-by-chef-marc-las-vegas\n\n10 people all going for tasting menus with some opting for wine paring. I'm not exactly a wine kinda guy so just food for me. Tho their italian beers were quite nice.\n\nCant exactly remember what we all ate but it was good. Damn good. If i wore panties they'd be dropped by the 3rd course. Oh and holy crap the bread is NICE!!! with the garlic butter on top and the balsamic vinegar and olive oil...sooooo nice\n\nSo going off of memory lets see what we had\n\n1 - Conch Salad\n - Very good texture, soft and not rubbery and oh so tender. Flavor was a little off for me but it opted a good opportunity to use the \"real\" salt they offered. Balanced quite nicely after that\n\n2 - Escargot (our special diet friends who opted not to have escargot got some kind of ravioli)\n - Two per person served on a slice of bread drenched in garlic butter with some herbs. Not exactly the freshest snails available but they did their best with what they had and it was no less then absolutely delicious \n\n3 - Fried Brussels sprouts with some kind of spicy prawn\n - I've only eaten brussel sprouts on a handful of occasions. These were halfed then fried to give them a nice flavor. The spicy prawns...wow just wow these were nice and plump and had a mild rising heat to them. Again quite nice\n\n4 - Pasta with wild mushrooms in some kinda sauce with ham in it - Pappardelle Wild Mushroom\n- LoL at my naming of items. This was the highlight of my dinner. The absolute best thing in my opinion. Pretty sure it was fresh pasta seeing as i've never seen noodle that big only on TV. The sauce they whipped up to bind the pork and mushrooms together with the noodles...genius...Ask Christie O i kept trying to steal her togo box the entire night.\n\n5 - Some kind of fish... - Wild Snapper Livornese\n- Some kind of fish and a portion of a barley like grain served with a tomato based sauce and a few strips of broccolini. \n\n6 - Dessert - Turamisu and Chocolate Mousse Cake\n - Holy crap the little square of Tiramisu was orgasmic. The other chocolate cake thingie was good but holy hell the tiramisu...\n\n\nI have finally discovered Chef Marc's...Now they will have to discover a way to keep me away."

Instead of answering our question about the pizza, he told us that the pizza was cheap.  It was a bit insulting the way he treated us.  Seems like Chef Marc is willing to be cordial and nice for the money.  The pizza was decent but I will definitely not bring my business here."

You get a complimentary bread basket, which is a nice touch. I tried to avoid eating it, but it was hard to resist! \n\nThey serve the best chicken parmesan I've had in a really long time! Their spinach ravioli was also pretty good. I can't wait to go back to try some of their other entrees.\n\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant was great! The lights were dim and they have a nice little seating area in the middle of the restaurant. The couches looked very inviting. The only negative is that if you're sitting near the door, every time someone walks in, the sun shines right in your face. They are so kind there, they let us change tables since we were blinded a couple of times. All in all, this was a great experience and I plan on going back!"

When Chef Marc is here, he ALWAYS comes to the table to talk about the food, see how you are, and make suggestions! Now for the food: INCREDIBLE!! This is some of the best Italian I have experienced in Las Vegas. It is a true gem located in an unsuspecting strip mall at Buffalo and Washington. The pasta is always fresh and I love their meat and seafood dishes. Also, if you're looking for a fresh, homemade dessert, save room!! I hesitated on writing this because I like keeping this as one of our special locals spots but it is too good not to share!!"

            "review": "Finally gave this a try for Lunch and answered the age old question, \"where's the beef?\"... the beef is clearly at Parma and it is in the Italian Beef sandwich. I would happily eat this every day and not be mad at myself when I gained a few hundred pounds.\nFriendly service, nice atmosphere and great food! Can't beat that. We met up with Mario S. for lunch as he had not tried the food here yet either.\nI can't speak for Mario, who ordered the Chicken Parm sandwich, but mine was awesome! By far the best Italian Beef sandwich I have ever had. The bread was perfect and they pack the sandwich with beef.\nThey had a special going where if you join their text mailing list, you get a free mini-cannoli. Yes please. We each got a mini-cannoli and they were about as good as they come. \nTook home a loaf of bread as well... it's pretty much gone already. Looking forward to more visits to Parma."

            "review": "I see the reviews on here and it's a joke. My families from Sicily and this is not Italian food. This is a New Yorkers excuse for Italian food. We came in around dinner time and were treated like we were invisible by the staff because we didn't make a reservation. When we finally got seated the \"Chef\" was making his \"rounds\" in the lobby acting important. When he finally came by our table we started asking about the food and where he was from and he was accommodating until we mentioned our family was from Sicily. He started talking about how New Yorkers make better Italian food. WRONG MOVE. \n\nI decided to play his game and asked him where he went to school to become a Chef and his answer was hilarious. \"You don't have to go to school to be a Chef.\" Well every Chef beyond Chef Boyardee went to school to earn the title of Chef, and you just decided you were a Chef? Honestly Chef Boyardee could of threw together the same Chicken Parmesan we had. Over fried and soaked in cheese and sauce to hide the cheap chicken they use. Any real Chef wouldn't even hire this guy to stir the sauce.\n\nThis guy was a piece of work. Egomaniacal. Probably the reason why one of his restaurants already closed and he can't sell the others. When he goes bankrupt he can start calling himself Dr. because you don't have to go to school to be a Dr. nowadays either."

Spaghetti happens to be one of my least favorite pastas. I had originally asked for a the eggplant parmesan sandwich. The waitress then said I might as well get the entree. Like I said, the food was good but when I got my check, it was twice as much as the lunch sandwich I was going to have. I was just passing through so it's not likely I will be back here."

It's hard finding good vegetarian pastas in this town. The EVOO, tomatoes, and zucchini shine in this dish. I don't feel like a glutinous heffer afterwards. Their bread is perfection. The caprese salad is beautiful with fresh slices of buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes. \n\nThey promote their specials via text if you sign-up. One time my friend got a text for a complimentary cannoli and the waitress brought one for each of us. A generous and sweet surprise. Excellent food and personable service goes a long way and Parma deserves all the praise and love it gets."

We were tired so we did the take out thing and when we got to the hotel we noticed they hadn't put silverware (plastic if you like) in our bag so we had to scramble to find forks. The food wasn't horrible but really wasn't anything to brag about. All in all we didn't enjoy it.\n\nI add to this review because they have taken the time to follow up with me. I really do appreciate any place that is willing to follow up and actually listens to their customers."

We were so sad when it closed; however, when Parma opened up we were not disappointed! Marc definitely didn't lose his touch with his new restaurant  and he is as friendly and as involved in his kitchen as ever. The dinners are a little on the pricey side, but I haven't had a better pasta. Lunch is a little more reasonable and Chef Marc has some amazing sandwiches which do no disappoint.  The only thing I don't love about Parma is that there are a few waiters whose personalities I just find off-putting...Overall though a wonderful dining experience!"

I've been waiting to review until I had the dinner service and I was not at all dissapointed!\n \nMy friend and I arrived and with a print out of the nights menu (yes, print out piece of paper like you're about to turn in a report to your history teacher) and was told these were being served tonight.  Chef Marc is so boss he has a dynamic menu.\n\nFor the evening we shared an escargot appetizer and pasta fagioli.  Escargot was heavenly and not garlic or salty heavy.  The pasta fagioli tasted very homemade and nice in this chill weather.  My main entree was the Atlanic Swordfish, which I will hold to a very high standard.  Every fisherman knows (or in my case, every television viewer of Deadliest Catch) knows that the prime season for catching and nom nom nom Swordfish is September and October.  What a fatty treat!  The fish was firm and fatty, just the exact way the fish should be without losing any of it's rich features in preparing it for a meal.  \n\nWell worth the price I paid for our meals.  Only minor complaint is the cramped area but the center design is so relaxing and puts you at ease.  Did I walk out with an awesome Italian restaraunt experience?  Absolutely.\n\nCheers for local businesses!"

The sandwich was under $10 and huge,  I took one look thought, good I will have some for later - but, no, I couldn't stop eating even though it was a lot of food.  The beef was thinly sliced, tender and tucked inside of the perfect roll.  You just can't underestimate how much impact the right choice of bread can have on a sandwich.  This roll was crusty and sturdy enough to hold together even when dunking the sandwich in sauce.  Yet, it wasn't too bread-y.  The sauce was spicy and perfect.\nIt was so delicious, I made sure to tell just about everyone I know how good the sandwich was, then I have spent the last week daydreaming about it and wondering when I can go back."

The menu is small but all the pastas are homemade. Chef Marc came out and talked with my fiancee and I and basically told us that we could mix and match different sauces with the pastas. It almost seemed as if he was daring us to give him something new to try. It was very personable and intimate. There were just a few tables and chairs. The rest of the staff was attentive but not overly friendly. The waitress brought us our waters and a delicious garlic bread. It really tastes as if it has been steamed in garlic or baked with garlic ground up in the bread. Very delicious. I ordered the gnocchi in the basil cream sauce. I am very picky about gnocchi but besides Ferraro's it is one of the best gnocchis I have tried in the U.S. Very delicious! My fiancee tried the gnocchi in a ragu sauce and it was just as good.

I looked to Yelp for guidance on which are the best dishes to select etc. and was surprised to see that the last few yelpers gave Parma such low ratings. We decided to venture in despite these reviews and were quite happily surprised. \n\nThe interior is casual .. very similar to Roma's Deli but is inviting and bright. The venue was half full and the bread is everything that fellow yelpers have described. Yummy, warm, with the delicious fresh olive oil and a nice portion of parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. We polished off two baskets! \n\nThe menu is quite small (and different from what is pubished online) .. but, you can also create your own dish by ordering off the chalkboard specials list which includes a number of homemade pastas etc. \n\nWe ordered the Beet salad and the Parma salad. Both were presented nicely and tasty and the Parma was a very very generous portion. That seriously could have been my meal! Fresh arugula, nuts, olives and a nice light dressing. I would def go back for that. For the mains we did the Shrimp Fra Diavolo and Pappardelle Bolognese and both were great. The Bolognese sauce was chock full of carrots, peas and nice pieces of sausage and was really good!\n\nFor dessert the Tiramisu .. this was the only thing we ordered that was \"just okay\" .. there was a large amount of cinnamon sprinkled on top, which was quite overpowering. \n\nAll in all .. we had a very nice dining experience here .. the servers were very nice, attentive .. we didn't have to wait long for the food to come out, and the food was tasty."

What a surprise when we arrived to find chef marc outside in the parking lot with his huge brick oven pizza maker set up. I have known for a while that he had a pizza maker that he could take to events for catering but didnt know that he brings it to the restaurant on wednesdays. I was thrilled and he showed me that it is so hot in the brick oven that pizza cook in just a few minutes. The restaurant was filled with people so i might recommend a reservation on a wed nite. We got a table without a wait and immediately Was brought 2 wonderful glasses of wine. All the waiters there are wonderful and work hard and fast. I ordered the bianco pizza which was a white pizza with arugula on top. The crust was thin and crispy with great flavor. There is a pizza menu with special pizzas but u can also just choose your own  toppings to add to a margarita pizza if u want. My husband didnt want pizza so he ordered off the regular menu and had chicken cacciatore which always comes with a side of pasta. The regular menu is limited but they will make anything you want so just ask and the dish will appear. I also had lunch there the other day and had a meatball sub to die for. My favorite restaurant just got better with the pizza night!\n\n\nVisited August 2011\nValue\nService\nWas this review helpful?

Our server was very nice and helpful.  My co-worker was in the mood for bruschetta which was not on the menu, but the chef made one for us anyway.\n\nIt was delicious with fresh tomatoes and a nice blend of acidity and sweetness.  \n\nI tried the fazoletti which was pretty good.

Or, perhaps fortunately since I'm pretty sure if you eat nothing but chicken parm sandwhiches 3 meals a day you would die. But it would be a pretty good way to go. Parma is tucked away in a little shopping centre and doesn't try to play the flashy game of strip restaurants. But the food delivers, and thats all that really matters. \n\nLet me tell you a little about this chicken parm sandwhich. First, it comes on garlic bread. I know this is obvious/other places have been doing it for years. But the fact remains that this is some of the best garlic bread I have ever gotten from a restaurant- its not mildly garlicy, its a knockout punch of garlic. The sandwhcih is also enormous- many will strain to finsih it in one sitting. The quitters are not worthy of such a sandwhich however, as the last few bites are always among the tastiest. \n\nI have also had the bolognese which was also quite good. \n\nThe service here is always excellent and attentive. It's a small, intimate sort of place with not that many tables which can make it hard to get a seat during peak times so plan accordingly."

I had clams and linguini and it was good but definitely had better in other restaurants. They give free garlic bread to start and its definitely amazing, hope your not on a date though because garlic stays in mouth for days...\n\nMy brother had butternut squash ravioli in a brown butter sauce and that was delicious. Better choice than my dish and reminded me of a dish i had before at a strip restaurant. \n\nOdd location but its nice because they sell meats and cheese at the counter as well as dry food products like pasta sauce, olive oil, etc.\n\nService was good though, friendly people throughout the restaurant.\n\nTo me food should wow you and i just wasn't wow'd may have been my fault though since i was so excited to try this place. Will give it another try and see how i feel after that."

The service was efficient but not at all overbearing and Chef Marc was in the dining room talking to friends and newcomers alike.  He  brought the dishes to life with his descriptions and gave outstanding recommendations.  I had the butternut squash ravioli with a brown butter sauce which was perfect.  The flavors of the sweet squash, tender homemade pasta and rich toasted sauce came together so nicely.  My mom had the pork chop, which isn't something either of us would usually consider ordering at a restaurant.  It was devine!  The thickest pork chop I've ever seen with a heavenly golden crust, cooked just perfectly.  The sauce was seasoned just right for her (1) with the option of spicing it up on a scale of 1-4.  \n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed and has a neighborhood feeling, which is tough to come by in Las Vegas.  We appreciate the experience offered by the folks at Parma and will definately be back!"

The food is excellent, but I thought the portions were a bit small for the price. \n\nI ate here with my wife, daughter, and son-in-law. I was tempted to order the spaghetti and meatballs but then noticed that the menu said \"spaghetti and meatball\" (singular), so I passed it up; my SIL had it, though, and sure enough, there was just one single solitary meatball (not even a terribly large one) sitting on top of his spaghetti. He said it was very good, but nonetheless I would expect more for $12. I had the meatball sub ($6.25 for a regular order) which was also quite tasty, but which only seemed to contain maybe two meatballs (they were sliced, so I don't know for sure). My wife and daughter split the chicken parmegian sandwich and spinach/cheese manicotti; they were both very impressed, though the bite I had of my wife's chicken sandwich didn't wow me (but then I always prefer meat to chicken). I don't mean to suggest that the portions were inadequate; there was certainly enough for a meal, but I just didn't think we got as much as I would expect for the price.\n\nOne nice feature was the garlic bread I asked for, which was very good, and for which we weren't charged, but that may be because our pasta dishes were supposed to come with bread, and this may have been that. It was not terribly garlick-y, but it did have a nice buttery texture and had crumbled parmesan cheese on it. \n\nIf you're in Vegas and you have a car, this place is well worth a visit."

I checked in on yelp as they claimed to have $3 off beer special per yelp checkin our server had absolutely no idea what I was talking about and proceed to ask me if I was sure it wasn't for the pizza place. I showed her my phone with the promo on yelp and she said let me talk to the chef. She came back after 15 mins of going back and forth she said that the chef said that the guy who does media and web specials is no longer with the company and they didn't know how to take it down and that they wouldn't grant the promo. Ok no biggie we've been here twice before and not only loved the food but also enjoyed talking to chef Marc so didn't make a big deal about it. My wife order the notorious Cab by the glass, which is on their menu,  and the server came back 5 minutes later saying they don't have it. We were already disappointed  twice but we brushed it off and proceed to look at the menu and asked for the popular complimentary bread thats toasted with garlic and cheese (I believe) but we got cold French bread, we were both disappointed as per our previous visits know it's always toasted warm bread so we asked her if she could warm up the bread she stared at the bread and said sure. We went ahead and order our lunch and waited for the bread to come back. To our surprise 15 mins later our lunch and the bread came out together and at that still cold. Lunch at Parma wasn't the worse experience we've had but a true let down compared to having dinner here. Let me say that the 2 stars is only for lunch and the servers poor service- she was really nice but far too casual and uninformed, had to go to kitchen for answers to every question we asked.  And the bread thing was just downright lazy.  As I've said before our dinner experiences here were amazing and my wife raved and gave Parma a 5 star rating I asked her not to change it and I'd yelp our lunch experience as I will be back for dinner soon. Again dinner is amazing just wouldn't recommend lunch here unless you plan on a grab and go sandwich from the deli."

I'm really hoping it was an off night because the service needed improvement and I found Marc (who might be a good cook but I don't think is a chef) uhm.... how can I say this delicately?  Less than a gracious host?   I was pretty stunned because at his last place I was invited back into the kitchen and we talked a lot about food, etc. and his staff even ordered some wine glasses for me that my out of town friends remarked on so I thought I would make a gift of them. (and that's bending over backwards!)  The closest word I can use to my interaction would be \"demeaning\".  Sorry I'm not a guy or a hot 20-something year old female where you clearly are in your comfort zone.\n\nIt also annoyed the living daylights out of me that even though I said I was dining alone when I came in, when I finally flagged someone down to try and get some food I was told \"Oh, I thought you were waiting for someone\".  I'm often out and about and get hungry and just stop somewhere, dining partner or not, and haven't waited more than a few minutes to be asked if I would like to order or if I'm waiting for someone.  (Which would be the logical question if the person who seated me didn't communicate with the person who would be taking my order)\n\nI had to get up and steal silverware from a table twice for myself and once for the couple sitting next to me.  Staff needs to pay attention to the details more.\n\nFOOD REVIEW:\n\nWine:  Sampled a red.  Pretty sure it was corked.  (or remarkably bad!)  Went with sparkling.  It was OK.\n\nNo hard liquor... or if there was I sure didn't see it!\n\nCaesar salad - flavorless.  I asked if they had any anchovies in the kitchen and was told no.  I'm not sure how you actually make a Caesar without anchovies but that explains part of the reason it had not flavor.\n\nEscargot:  Except a bit of grit in the very first bite... quite outstanding.  If you order these do not eat bread first because they do not come in the shell but rather on top of toasted Bread.\n\nBread:  really good.\n\nGnocchi:  Lovely light, fluffly pillows of joy but the sauce which was described as white wine cream sauce should have been described as creamy garlic sauce.  It's an Italian place so garlic should be expected but it was far too much for my liking.  I couldn't  taste the peas which I thought was a lovely combination with spec and gnocchi.  Overall sweetness was a bit much.  I would have cut the garlic and added blue cheese.\n\nCannoli :   Respectable.\n\nEveryone seems to rave about this place and I think it's because it's fundamentally good food albeit inconsistent.  Professional or home grown good food is good food.   However, they need to work on the service and level of knowledge on both food and wine.   It was a Saturday night and should have been packed and was less than half full.  With all the great reviews that shouldn't be the case.\n\n\nSUMMARY:   Meh.  There's lots of great food in Vegas.  Dining experience is important and it just wasn't a hit for me."

I know that many people talk about the chefs on the Strip, but I purposely avoided that route for my friends bachelor party. At first, people were complaining about how we had to detour from the row of lights to go to dinner, but they quickly shut up after we began our gastronomical journey. \n\nAny special occasion can only be made better with a visit to Chef Marc's Parma. I was lucky enough to tag along with some Yelpers and have been hooked on this restaurant ever since. Call in advance and specify that you want to participate in a chef's table. For $50, a five course meal is a steal. An additional $20 more, there is an option for wine pairing. With a week notice, chef will be able to set up a marvelous spread. Long gone are the days where a chef tries to fill you up on bread and cheap ingredients. Chef even got upset that someone had given us bread. \n\nI had specified that one friend was allergic to pine nuts and melon. Another to pineapple, almonds, and does not eat pork. Chef said no problem and I was relieved. \n\nThis was my second chance to experience a meal from this creative genius. He started us off with some sliced prosciutto before our first course. We were in for a real treat when we found out that chef brought out the pizza oven on a Sunday night. Not only did we get a classic margherita but a walnut pesto pizza as well. This was a creative way around our friend's allergy. Then the second course came at us with no warning. A sampler platter of perfectly grilled octopus, shrimp, sausage, and red snapper surrounding a bed of apple salad tossed in a citrus dressing. Already, some were ready to admit that the drive was worth it. Now slowing down, Chef came out again to explain what he had in store for us. Two words: LOBSTER RAVIOLIS! That was our pasta course. The al dente stuffed goodness was filled with the crustacean and came with a marscapone cream sauce. For many, it could have ended here and we would have received a meal worthy of $50. An Italian meal without a protein? Unheard of. Stepping outside of the box to provide us with a truly unique experience, we were presented with Veal Cheek served on polenta with German red cabbage. The meat was so tender that you could cut it with a fork. The sauce was similar to an Osso Bucco sauce. Each component complimented each other so well. By this time we were all stuffed. Yet it did not end there. For dessert, chef sent out a french toast served with fresh bananas and berries topped with a Marsala wine sauce. Ambrosial! Still not enough? The groom to be and I had opted for the wine pairing. I had attended a wine tasting some time ago and came across a beautiful dessert wine that I had nearly forgot about until I took a sip here. Although our waiter prefaced that the wine didn't go with the dessert, I was happy to taste the Donald Ziraldo dessert wine again. \n\nAt this point, I could not hold it in any longer and had to gloat. BOOYAH! All of the skeptics could eat it, because this meal was sensational."

Upon pulling up to the restaurant it looked kinda cheap like a Fazzoli's but as soon as I walked in, the atmosphere quickly changed my mind. It was a deli with a sense of an intimate ambiance, kind of a contradiction but that's what I was feeling. Nice lounge in the middle with tables set up on the sides and deli meat and fresh pasta at the counter.\n\nThe service was a 10. I believe I was approached, seated and served by a Pamela. She seemed to be one of the only ones working but let me tell you she sure worked that room and did what she could. I could only go for lunch and had that spaghetti Bolognese which was amazing, right amount of pasta to meat, with the pasta achieving that perfect al dente touch. Also had the chopped salad that had red vinegar dressing, tomatoes, salami, blue cheese, and some other items and I have to say that tasted very fresh. My only complaint was the meatball sub. I heard it was supposed to be the best there but when I received it, it was cold and I don't mean sitting at pickup for 30 minutes luke warm cold or cold like they had just pulled out of the refrigerator cold. But more like I made it this morning and 4 hours later here you have it cold. Kinda weird because the pasta was hot and we got there at 11 and the place opens at 10 (so how old was this sub?) Ah well, outside of the meatball sub, this place was an unexpected pleasant surprise and I will be back.\n\n2nd visit\nCame back because they initially had good service and I thought I'd give them a chance to make up for that cold meatball sub. Well, somehow they managed to go from on the verge of being great to now being subpar. We didn't get the charm of Pamela, this time our order was taken by a bald guy who wrote down the wrong order and then made our 2nd order to go even though the first order was for here and on plates. (But hey I guess things happen so whatever.) This time we ordered the carbonara and this lasagna type dish with sausage and red sauce that was good at first bite but after the next several I felt like I had greasy tomato soup. It was moderately busy in there so I understand what it's like when restaurants are at full capacity but it wasn't even close. Ah well, I think two times is enough for me and it's on to the next Italian spot."

Misplaced orders, wrong food brought. But most of all, the casual deli atmosphere is not a match to the prices on the dinner menu, nor is it much of a nice environment for dinner."

This place is not fancy, actually its small.\nPrices are a little high, but I will still come back over and over. I walked away full and feeling great. Itialian sause gives me an upset stomach, not this place ! Real homemade pasta and sauce, and had a deli to boot when you leave, \nIf you want a real Itialian food you have to try this place. had the portabella mushrooms with 4 cheese , amazing appitizer! and a pasta what was think and made at their place. They import spices from Italy!! Again I never waste time on a review , but this place deserves it. I will be telling all the guys at Neilis and Creech AFB to come here. \nLooks to have a inexpesive lunch menu whice I will try next.\nThanks for great service too!!"

There is a deli and cheese counter in the front, along with a rack of specialty Italian ingredients and sauces for sale in the back of the restaurant. We actually picked up some stuff there because my sister in law and her husband were coming to visit from Italy and had promised us a home cooked Italian meal.\n\nWe chose to split the Antipasti salad that was prepared with a generous assortment of meat and cheese from the deli case. The salad was fresh and plentiful for the price of $12.00. We also split the very hearty Italian meat sandwich which only  comes in large (most of the sandwiches you have the option between regular and large). This was a monster of a sandwich with juicy beef, melted provolone and mozzarella cheese topped with pepperocinis. As delicious as it was, I could only handle about quarter of the sandwich. The husband happily annihilated the rest of it. The service was friendly and this made for a perfect break in our busy day."

Our server was there with helpful suggestions every time we turned around. He asked the right questions, too, like when we ordered the chefs tasting, he asked if we were allergic to anything or had dietary restrictions ( hubby does. Lots of them). He was not snooty at all and explained everything we wanted info on without pretention. Not only that but chef marc came by and personally asked if we liked the meal. The food was outstanding (more on this in a minute) but the service was even better. Hubby tipped like 40%. Other restaurants could learn a lesson or four from these guys. Servers get tipped according to service. Give excellent, above-and-beyond service, you'll get tipped very well, at least by us.\n\n2. The FOOD! I come from philly, where good italian restaurants are on virtually every street corner, and where i grew up eating at church dinners where little old italian ladies slaved over hot stoves to feed armies of hungry parishioners every sunday afternoon. I may not be italian, but i know (and love) good, authentic italian food. This was the real deal. The fresh-baked bread was simultaneously crunchy & chewy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside, AND sprinkled with fresh parmeasan. We ordered the chefs tasting meal, and it was catered just to us, and included a lovely capresi salad with fresh mozzarella, swordfish that was so tender i could hardly believe it on a bed of some sort of wild grains in a light lemon & capers sauce that was absolutely delectable, a pasta selection that was homemade with morrel mushrooms that were to die for, and the most light & fluffy tiramisu which was so good I coulve eaten another one, even though i was STUFFED. \n\nJulia child said \"freshness is essential. That makes all the difference .\". This is true of Parma. Ill also add that loving ones job makes all the difference. Bravo, chef marc! We love your food AND your restaurant.  Im a new, big, fan!\n\n3. Price. For food this good you can't beat the price. We got the tasting, which was $50 each and the most expensive thing on the menu. There were several entrees under $20.  You could conceivably order two lower-priced entrees and get away with a $50 meal. Well worth every penny. \n\n4. Ambiance. It was homey, not pretentious, and much like the italian restaurants i grew up going to. There were kids there too, which i like, as i like a family restaurant where my kids are welcome. I liked the painting of sinatra i was seated near and kept looking at it. They could maybe use a nice mural though - i know some good people who do this if anyones reading this!\n\nAll in all a 5 star + experience. We will be back, and we'll bring people with us!"

Reality check to follow...\n\nC'mon folks.  4.5 stars?  Lots of 5 star reviews?  Seriously?  Among the best Italian places in Las Vegas?  New York?  Italia?\n\nSeveral reviewers mention comparison to Olive Garden, and compared to that chain restaurant disappointment, well, yes.  Parma is 5 stars.\n\nHere's the truth.  Parma is a good neighborhood Italian restaurant.  The decor is simple.  Nothing fancy.  The service is semi-pro - mostly young, though energetic, fairly efficient and casual.  The kitchen puts out decent Italian dishes of good quality, especially the house made pastas. The overall experience is casual and family-worthy.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.\n\nHere are some specific observations.  A dining companion wanted mussels as an appetizer, and they weren't on the menu.  Our server this evening, Kelly, says no problem.  The kitchen has them for Frutto Di Mare, so we can do that.  Nice job, Kelly.\n\nParma's Caesar salad is bland and forgettable.  Last night the romaine had lots of brown edges.  Meh.  There's nothing special on top like shaved Parmesan, and the croutons were one step above store bought.  No cracked pepper was offered upon serving, and there wasn't a mention of anchovies, a part of an authentic Caesar.\n\nThe good news is the pasta is terrific.  Nicely made and properly cooked.  Try the lobster ravioli.  Sauces are decent but I find the bolognese sauce is not a star.  \n\nMarc's pork chop is amazing.  Thick and juicy.  You won't be disappointed.\n\nParma's wine list is short and is value minded, not over the top.  The wines by the glass list is not stellar with the exception of the Tobin James cab.  I recently ordered a bottle of the 2009 Bere \"Super Tuscan\".  The bottle arrived, opened and poured, and it was noticed that the wine was actually a 2011.  Rookie mistake.\n\nThe location in a strip shopping center should provide insight to the experience at Parma.  Casual, decent Italian fare, but not sophisticated or accomplished as some of the reviews here on Yelp suggest.\n\nJust keep in' it real..."

To start their pasta is made in-house and you can certainly taste the the quality.  They continue to go the extra mile though...bringing in fresh peas at the end of the bolognese instead of cutting corners...adding balanced capers to the vegetable papardelle...preparing the chicken parmesan to order--creating a beautiful texture that is void at higher-end restaurants...dish after dish is special.\n\nThe Chef's Table is the true star at Parma!  It's a perfect value too at $50 / $70 with wine.  I have paid twice as much for equally enjoyable meals multiple times in Vegas!\n\nParma is classic Italian executed wonderfully!"

We arrived 15-20 minutes late but did make sure to call the restaurant ahead. \n\nOnce we arrived, our table was waiting for us and were seated right away. Our waiter was very friendly. We were ordering food and planning to share it family style. The waiter had great suggestions for how much food we should get.\n\nWe started with some escargot and some salad for appetizers. The escargot was delicious. I've had escargot by itself before so I knew what to expect but the way it was served on the bread with the garlic and other seasonings was delicious! I would highly recommend everyone giving it a try.\n\nOverall the food came out quick and didnt really have any issues with any of it. While we were waiting for the main course, we were nibbling on the bread. The bread is damn good. Just try not to eat too much of it, though I would've been just fine eating the bread and the extra sauce from the escargot as my meal.\n\nFor our main course, we went with chicken parmesan, the 4 cheese ravioli with pesto sauce, and the Cavatelli Bolognese. They were all very good. I liked the chicken parmesan the best out of them all. A couple of the guys had to order their dishes separately due to being vegetarian and being sensitive to diary. They had the 4 cheese ravioli with a marinara sauce and a clam dish. The clam dish was quite large and smelled really good.\n\nSomething to note: if you are staying on the strip, this place is about 20 minutes away. The cab ride is going to be about $40. While the cab ride can be pricey, the food isn't very expensive (especially compared to food options on the strip) and is really good. I'll definitely making my way back to this spot the next time I'm in vegas!"

But that's just not the reality.\n\nIt's not that the food is bad. It's not bad at all. It's just not outstanding. There's nothing amazing about this place. It's small and cramped and the menu is miniscule,\nIn fact, everything about Parma Pastavino is small, except the prices. \nMy linguine frutti de mare was fine; with fresh clams, mussels, calamari and shrimp...but for $28? Hello?\n\n(By the way: if you check the online menu, the prices are about 35% higher when you get to the actual restaurant:...nice bait and switch Chef Marc!)\n\nThose kind of prices are comparable to Ferraro's...but there it's actually worth it, being a more beautiful and informed restaurant.\n\nAnd another of my pet peeves: how can any self-respecting restaurant not invest in a reverse osmosis water filtration system for their tap  water. Everyone knows that vegas water is some of the worst in the nation! \nAnd I'm not just talking about the water in your glass...don't forget that they use the same water to cook the pasta, rice and anything else that's boiled."

We live here in Las Vegas, and it was the best sandwich I've had anywhere in town my Wife felt the same about her dish. I might add I am very very picky about my sandwiches, and know true Italian sandwiches, this was fantastic. we intend to go back there for their dinners as I've heard so many nice things about their meals. their customer service was outstanding!!!"

Doesn't look like much from outside but believe me, this place still got me grinning from ear to ear!..\n\nRecommendations:\n\nItalian Bread with butter (included) - Always fresh and a nice starter every time..\n\nSpaghetti Bolognese Pork: Fresh Pasta (made in house), little chunks of sausage, little chopped cubes of carrots and their red sauce.. The pasta was Incredible, sauce was like butter with some aromatic and delicious olive oil  and an excellent balance of tomato sweetness and tart that was sure to more than satisfy!.. \n\nSpaghetti Zucchini Pomodoro: Fresh Pasta, thick slices of zucchini, herbs, red sauce.... 99% of the time, I order pasta with some type of meat (meatballs, sausage, beef, chicken..), this time I decided to go meatless.. WOW!!!!! Seriously, this was Beyond Anything I expected.. One of The Best Pasta Anything I've Ever Ate!  \n\nMeat Lasagna: Fresh slices of pasta in between layers of meat, sauce, ricotta.. Rich in flavor, got that creaminess to it and definitely filling. Should fill up 2 hungry people and have leftovers.. \n\nRum Cake: Definitely had that rum liqour  fragrance, moistness and taste that will send you off to dessert bliss! Nothing too Fancy, Just Rumtastic!\n\nThe first time I dined here, I was so impressed that I almost stayed to have dinner right after a late lunch.. Like Back to Back Meals!! Every night, the chef comes in and decides what will be on the menu for that particular night. So next time, So and so dish might not show up again or at least for a while.. \n\nThe service was great every visit, lunch prices awesome, dinner prices average and the ambiance very comforting and a tad elegant the same time. Aside from the typical bench, table/chair dining, they also got couches/coffee table seating as well. *Most importantly*, Both Spaghetti entrees mentioned above deserve Much More than a 5 Star Praise!!!!! They Really Set A New Standard In My Book: On How Pasta Should Taste Like!!!!!"

It was a winning find for us, so much so that we booked a second visit for Sunday.  I loved the casual feel of the center section with couches available for a glass of wine. Our server Diane was friendly, knowledgeable and generous-thank you.  \nStarter- great garlic bread, perfectly toasted and seasoned. The wine is reasonably priced and well selected. We enjoyed a bottle of Friulano- Bastianich.\nAppetizers- Pasta Fagioli-homemade, my husband loved it.  Parma  salad - huge amount of arugula, olives, walnuts, Parmesan cheese, mushrooms, artichokes and lightly dressed, just right. \nEntrees- Gnocchi in a light cream with Speck, unbelievable.  It was like going to heaven and coming back to tell about it.  Jumbo Shrimps Fra Diavlo with homemade  spaghetti.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, just the right amount of kick, and the shrimps were cooked perfectly. \nBy now we are beyond stuffed and Diane brings out prosciutto & provolone cheese.  \nDelicious but we took that home along with an extra order of fresh mozzarella.\nNow for dessert.  An order of lemon ricotta cheesecake, not traditional but good. To finish of us off, Diane brought out a mini cannoli and a piece of rum cake - they were outstanding.  It was a food love fest throughout the entire evening. We wish we had Parma II in New Jersey."

The quality of food you get at this place is above some of the posh Italian joints on the strip. All the servers are extremely friendly and Chef Marc will personally stop by your table to educate everyone on his unique creations. I've been here twice and never been disappointed with any of the food I've ordered. \n\nThe best thing about their pasta dishes is that pastas are freshly made and their sauces are unique to each variety of pasta dish to compliment it.  I also love their mushroom and spinach appetizer, its not on the menu sometimes, but every time I've asked for it they have made it for us. I would also recommend their Chicken Marsala, the sauce is just out of this world. \n\nThe tasting courses offered at Parma are also exquisite. Chef Marc take a liberty on trying out new dishes that combine old Italian recipes with neo-American Italian style. Lot of these experimental dishes were featured in a yelp event that I went to. The best thing about this event was  the way Chef Marc educated uninformed foodies like me about the history and his childhood experience with particular Italian dishes and his versatile take on it. \n\nThis is the best Italian food you'll have in Las Vegas and for the the quality of food and the service make this the best deal for the prices they are charging. Its great for any occasion. And its the best way to end my 2014 Yelp review line up."

On Thursday 10/4, My son and I arrived at Parma just before 3 p.m.  There was only one table occupied with 2 people.  When we walked in a woman yelled to us from the kitchen area(we were not greeted at the door) asking if we were \"for here or to go\".  When we told her we wanted to sit down she told us to 'just sit anywhere, I\"ll be right with you.\"  Over the course of the next ten minutes that we sat at our table, she brought over two different dishes of food to the occupied table (only 4 tables away from us).  She spent the rest of the time talking with the guys in the kitchen.  After ten minutes of not even an acknowledgement of our existence, we got up and left.  She never acknowledged our leaving either.  There are plenty of other restaurants that appreciate our business.  We wont be going back here for sure."

The chef, Marc, he usually comes to each table and explains special of the day. The severs are very polite & friendly. The other night, I wanted to try something light food, so I've shared the 'Antipasto Salad' & 'Potato Gnocchi with Bolognese sauce' with my friend. I enjoyed tasting the artichoke hearts & sliced salami which were lightly covered with red wine vinaigrette dressing. Also, lots of chunky vegetables, pork, & beef gave me a tons of flavor to the potato Gnocchi. The potato gnocchi wasn't overly cooked at all. The texture was just perfect :) And I had some warm fresh garlic breads, too ;) \nThis time, I tried the bottle of 'Espresso Manhattan Coffee Soda' as a dessert drink which was a bubbly iced coffee drink that I never tried before.. It was alright, though.. \n\n***My favorite dishes so far~~Antipasto Salad, Rigatoni with Vodka cream sauce, Fried Meatballs, Rum cake, Cannoli, & Fresh brewed Italian Coffee*** \n\nI think it's a great place to have a casual dinner with loved ones & have a sweet conversation...or good for a small group of people gathering :p"

Today my husband & I decided to try it for lunch. It's location makes the restaurant appear more like a deli than a nice Italian restaurant.  We initially didn't want a \"sit down\" meal, but when we got inside we knew we had to stay. \nWe were greated upon arrival by our waitress, who was wonderful. Unfortunately I can't remember her name.  She helped with selection of our meals & answered our questions with great enthusiasm!  I wanted a 1/2 sandwich and she never tried to up-sell me on a bigger one. She offered a salad, which was a great choice. It was fresh with homemade Italian dressing. I ordered the eggplant parm sandwich (half). It was the best I have ever had.  My husband ordered the full Italian sausage sandwich, & brought the 2nd half home.  The food was a little late coming out-we were told the bread was over toasted. To make up for this, we were offered complimentary dessert. We were so full, but couldn't pass it up. It was a 4 layer lemon cake with whipped cream frosting.  SO good! \nWe asked about their dinner menu. Our waitress told us how the menu is different every night & then explained \"Pizza Night\" on Wednesdays.  The best part was her excitement over their menu & Chef Marc.  We are excited about taking friends with us next time.  By the way, the bread is wonderfully fresh and Delicious!"

            "review": "This... is... why... I... eat...\nMy friend told me about this place that had good hand-made pasta. What I found was something else entirely. Everything about the evening was a pleasant surprise. Upon entering, you're greeted with a friendly staff in what appears to be a deli/grocery store. The dining tables are tucked near the side of the restaurant and the main visual is a giant deli-style counter. But unless you're expecting a world-class Michelin Star experience, decor isn't a big deal. Just bring on the food. The wait staff was awesome. They were prompt and gave us some great suggestions on dinner. We're suckers for daily specials and chef recommendations, but you really do need to listen to the folks at Parma. They know what they're talking about. We did a huge family style meal. Some highlights:\n\nPortabello mushroom appetizer - Not sure what they call this but it was amazing. Perfectly cooked portabello mushrooms served over greens and a cheesy cream sauce. We used the bread to mop up all of the leftover sauce when the portabello was gone. Next time I'm going to ask if they can put this sauce over some pasta.\n\nAntipasto - Great variety of deli meats, cheeses, and greens. Fresh is the running theme for the night. The quality of the vegetables is evident in all the dishes.\n\nMozzarella appetizer - Remember what I said about the vegetables?When you take a bite into the cheese, tomatoes, and spinach, your focus isn't on the mozzarella, it's on the veggies. It's fresh, crisp, and full of flavor. The mozzarella's almost an afterthought.\n\nChicken Marsala - I'm usually not a fan of the Chicken Marsala. Maybe it's because I've eaten it too much. Maybe it's because I worked at Cheesecake Factory in college and I had to smell Chicken Marsala every... single... night. Needless to say, I wasn't especially looking forward to Chicken Marsala. I don't hate it, but I usually don't order it willingly. When I took a bite out of the Parma Chicken Marsala, I was blown away. It's unlike any other. Most other restaurants will cook away the Marsala wine completely. Chef Marc decided to leave a bit of the wine in and it totally makes the dish. The leftover alcohol lingers on the tongue. Totally unexpected. I'm hoping that's by design and not a mistake.\n\nFrutti de Mar - A little on the pricey side but it's definitely delicious. Big pieces of shrimp, clams, and scallops are nestled in a bed of linguini. I was looking for a bit of seafood flavor in the sauce and it was definitely there at the end. I think we saved the dishwasher some work. There was nothing left our plates when we were done.\n\nNice little surprises were spread out over the night. A fresh batch of some grated exotic cheese one moment. A complimentary serving of prosciutto the next. Jason really took care of us.\n\nParma's not cheap. If you expect Olive Garden prices, you should go to Olive Garden and get the all-you-can-eat pasta and breadsticks for  $7.99. Do you get a good value for your dining dollar at Parma? Oh yah. Pass the bread, please."

I must have passed by a bunch of times to go to the Trader Joe's but never knew this was here.  I chose this place to celebrate a special occasion and was pretty satisfied with all of my food.\n\nStarting off, the bread is pretty darn good.  It is warm and fresh with olive oil and parmesan cheese.  We shared a salad for appetizer.  Since we couldn't decide between the corn and tomato salad and the heirloom tomato and mozarella salad, Chef Marc made a combo salad for us that was delicious.  Simple and fresh ingredients.  I felt like I was eating them straight from the farmer's market.  For dinner I got the Chicken Franchese which were 3 breaded chicken pieces with a lemon butter sauce served with sauteed cauliflower and brocollini.  The chicken was a great comfort food dish and the veggies were seasoned well.  We also ordered the Chicken Parmesan, one of their most popular dishes.  Two ginormous pieces of breaded chicken slathered with cheese and marinara sauce.  It is served with a side of pasta, which was nothing special, and the side of veggies.  We were too full for dessert but we were very satisfied with our Italian feast!.  Definitely come here if you want some good Italian.  Thanks Chef Marc!"

Tables and chairs to the left and to the right.  Great service.  Reasonable prices.  Meals ordered: spaghetti and hot sausage with side of meatballs - Hot Sausage - A+. Sauce is okay.  We are East Coasters - so Italian in NJ/NY is unbeatable.  Meatballs - NO.  They use all beef - meatballs must be done beef/pork!!!  Eggplant parm - FANTASTIC!  No fried breading - just awesome eggplant, sauce, cheese - delicious.  Butternut Squash ravioli - tasty but too much ravioli and not enough stuffing.  Beer and wine on menu.  Located in a shopping strip - easy parking.  We will be back!"

I walked in thinking it was another sandwich place and was surprised it was also nice sit down restaurant and they sold deli meats and a small assortment of Italian groceries.\n\nThere's a lounge area in the middle with couches and coffee tables if you want a more casual meal but there are tables on the side if you prefer the traditional sit-down meal.\n\nI had a really good italian sub to-go once before then came back for a sit-down dinner. We had some house chianti and then a portabello and spinach appetizer that came in a creamy mushroon sauce. Then for the main course we got the veal saltimbuco served with a side of really really good rigatoni...really good. Both were equally awesome and the crusty bread was great for dipping in both sauces.\n\nGreat service and great food"

Anticipating its opening, we stopped in immediately after opening.  \n\nFirst, you are always greeted by a member of the staff, often Chef Marc; and if what you want is not on the menu, or you're in the mood to try something new, Marc will prepare it for you.  Further, this is THE only place I've been to in Vegas where you can get great fresh pasta, sauces, cheeses and tastycakes, an East Coast delicacy that everyone should try.  (I think Krimpets alone got me through my grade school lunch trading days).  \n\nThe environment is casual - I've enjoyed sandwiches to-go, take-out dinner, sit down lunch, a glass of wine in the comfy sofa area as well as a nice, long dinner with a great bottle of wine.  Just a great place to sit down and have a meal.  In addition, the staff is incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, the wine list, etc.  Our waiter was quick to suggest an alternate wine (which was a hit) and was friendly, informative, fun without being intrusive.  \n\nAlas, the pasta is always fresh, and innovative twists on old favorites (for me, it's any combination of fresh tomato and mozzarella) make Marc's a MUST for any Italian food fan or displaced east coaster yearning for a fresh pasta dish.\n\nLove this place."

The staff is genuinely friendly, enthusiastic and consistently attentive. The pasta is sooo fresh: melty, chewy and pillow-y at once. Ordered the orecchiette with sausage, mushrooms and broccolini. It was bursting with such intense and savory flavors and texture that I rolled my eyes back in delight. I was even compelled to have a glass a wine when I finished the leftovers for lunch the next day, just to keep the memory alive...\n\nAlso ordered the chicken parm, which was huge, homey and satisfying. We watched a variety of dishes go by to other smiling patrons and heard them discussing how tasty their food was. They make their own sausage, so don't deny yourself the opportunity! Dessert, espresso and cappuccino was on par with everything else. We had lots of leftovers and had to go the whole distance. \n\nYes, there is an abundance of Italian restaurants in town, but Parma hits all the targets with superb service, food and atmosphere. This tops the recommendation list for anyone."

It's part deli, part restaurant and part lounge?  When you enter there is a large couch seating area. on the inside wall there are Italian supplies and then there are dinning tables and another dinning section inside.  The front is for the cashier and a gelato fridge.  \n\nI started with the white bean soup.  I'll be getting this on return visits, it had a great mix of flavors and the white bean and noodle went well together. I ordered the eggplant parmesan which was good too but was a little salty and came with a side of spaghetti which I did enjoy.  Overall, the food tasted good to me and I would like to try the dinner menu.  I saw them go to the microwave a lot so that did have me a little worried.  I think the night/weekend shifts are probably better and have fresher food than a Tuesday lunch.\n\nThe menu was limited on my visit to some sandwiches and a small selection of pastas among a couple other choices.  Looking online, I see a lot of dishes which are only available at night (mac and cheese and my absolute favorite Gnocchi).  I'll need to return to try them and if they are as good as it looks I'll edit my review.  I was hesitant to choose the spaghetti with Bolognese because some of the pictures I've seen online it didn't look like what I'm familiar with (a darker richer sauce, online it looks like just red spaghetti sauce and if it was what I got with my selection I wouldn't have liked it as my only dish item).  I would have liked a larger selection for lunch at least offer the signature dishes and being out of town it will be a challenge to revisit in the short term."

It was a drive for us from the east side to the west but based on the reviews we decided to give it a try.  It was easy to find and the lot was full.  As we opened the door we were met by this 6' 5\" or so guy who just shouted out \"do you have a reservation?\"  that kind of put us off as we did not and not even a welcome to parma, how are you this evening,  nothing.  He said I can put you over here and just sat us at a table, no menus!  a couple minutes later a long came some fantastic bread and finally a waiter who asked if we had menues.  By this time we were thinking we made a big mistake, but the place was full, no empty tables.  During the course of the next 20 minutes or so we watched at least 4 groups of 2 -5 walk in the door and out the door because they had no reservations.  This place could use more tables and getting rid of all the sofas and chairs in the middle of the dining room would be a great help.  We never seen anyone use them.  What a waste of space and the loss of customers and revenue.  Since the tables are so close to each other we seemed to be joined in the conversations from tables on both sides of us.  All anyone could say was this was the best food in town and we come here every week and so on.  We ordered, wine, Antipasto plate - which was huge and full of meats, cheese, olives, tomatoe and salad and enough for the 3 of us.  We had the piatta, the parmigano and the parpadelle and were just amazed at how great this food was.  It had to be the best Italian meal I have ever had outside of a couple trips to the italian hillsides.  We can not wait to come back to this great little gem.  The host needs to loosed up and smile and be more personable to customers and they need to clear the way of those sofas for about a dozen more table or so.  Had it not been for the host and the slow service at the beginning I would have rated this a 5 star and maybe after our next visit I will.  The table next to us asked to see the owner and was told he had just opened a new Pizza Restaurant, We did not get the name but look forward to trying it next.\nYou just cant go wrong here, the 3 of us with wine the antipasto and 3 entrees came to $101 before the tip.  P.S.  they just dont stop bringing you this wounderful bread.\nENJOY!"

Also it seemed as if they couldn't figure out who would seat us.\n\nQuickly dropped of our water and asked if we wanted anything else to drink.  Getting the bread took quite a bit longer and it was extremely hot on the crust and cold in the middle.  Seemed like it was taken out of the fridge and thrown into a broiler or oven for a minute.\n\nWe had a salad and a cup of soup, decent enough but $12 for a beet salad seem a few dollars high.  We had been finished with those for at least 10 minutes before they came around to collect the empty dishes we had put to the side of our table.\n\nI didn't time it, but it seemed that it took another 20+ minutes to get our entrees, chicken piccata and lasagna.  Again it was not a busy night, maybe four other groups of people in there.  Not explanation as to what took so long, but alas our food arrived.  I had the chicken piccata, and that and veal piccata are on of my favorite dishes and this was probably the worst I have had.  The entire meal, chicken and side vegetables were floating in an extremely bland flavorless sauce.  What few capers came with the dish were the only thing that provided any flavor other than plain, cooked chicken.\n\nAll in all in was an experience that will not make me want to return.  Our server seemed very bored and wasn't capable of clearing more than two plates at a time.\n\nFor $80 after tip with no cocktails, I would expect a better meal/dining experience than this.  Not sure how they won the best pasta award, unless I was there on an off night, but I won't be back any time soon to have them prove me wrong."

Parma makes no such sacrifice. \n\nThe best Italian meal I had was in a small town in Tuscany called Monti. It was someone's house that doubled as the village restaurant.  And although I spoke no Italian, we dined with the family on the freshest dishes in a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. Dinner at Parma was no less special.  Amazing food, quality service and an ambiance that is uniquely both casual yet truly authentic in it's Italian roots.  \n\nWe had a wonderful Chilean wine followed by a Margherita pizza as an appetizer. My wife and I then shared the pork chop el Chico which was fabulous. \n\nBut what made the entire evening so great was the time and care chef Marc took to help us decide which menu items would make our meal special for us.  The time he took, the food he prepared and the wonderful atmosphere of his restaurant made five stars a given. Trust me, you'll love it!"

Hmmm I said, let me see what I can cook up as a  unique dining experience vs. high end Panda Express....\n\nThankfully, a bunch of yelpers have recommended Parma and after reading Rod U's review and everyone's review, I was ready to rock and roll!\n\nFirst thing of course I discovered is that the menu for dinner which most reviewers discussed is not same as dinner.  Here are my thoughts.\n\na.  Location - 4 star - Not bad considering I don't venture in this area.  Easy to get to right off the Summerlin Pkwy Buffalo Drive exit.  Plenty of parking in a nondescript strip mall.\n\nb.  Ambiance - 4 star - When I first walked in, it felt more like a deli compared to a restaurant like Nora's or something, but it was both funky and cool at same time. Reminded me of a coffee shop, a deli, a cafe, and a small restaurant all in one.\n\nc.  Service - I will say this is 5+ star.  Very friendly, very knowledgeable and very accommodating. They know their stuff and what the kitchen can do, so it makes it very cool to talk about the menu. \n\nd.  Menu - 4 star - their lunch menu features a few salads, antipasta, home made pasta, sandwiches both hot and cold, some soups.  I was so eager to try some of the yelping good ideas that I asked our waiter about what specials.  He quickly said that they can whip up some Linguine with Clams and / or Shrimp far diavolo.  We ordered this and some side salads.\n\ne.  Food - 5 star - The best thing started when I said, hey since both the pastas are not on the lunch menu, we will try it and can we split it.  Quickly the waiter said that since one was a red sauce and one was white, that it would not mix well and so when we said how about the spaghetti bolognese, he said PERFECT.  I have to say, the waiter, Mark I think handled this just right! Both dishes were fantastic.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and a bit smaller diameter compared to normal spaghetti pasta. I liked the texture and the feel when you were stuffing it all in your mouth.  It had the COMFY feeling!!!  The side salads were recommended and they were the right size and had just a bit of spiciness and it was perfect.\n\nf. Je ne sais quoi - 5 star +++ - This place has that \"je ne sais quoi\" , that \"I don't know what\" factor. It is the confidence in the kitchen, the knowledge of the staff, the coolness of funky ambiance of the restaurant, the home made pasta.  I am not sure but all of this combined makes for a most awesome experience!\n\nI will be coming back for lunch as it is so cool and relaxing.  I am also excited to come fo dinner with my wife as she loves Italian inspired food and so I cannot wait to try the dinner menu.\n\nGK says, if you are around for lunch, check this place out!"

I had a stellar lunch here a few months back and BF had been wanting to try Chef Marc's for dinner because he had read a yelp about the Chef's Table menu.  I had worried about the dinner atmosphere and being rushed because the place isn't overly large.  I gladly admit that I couldn't have been more wrong.  We arrived a couple minutes early for our Saturday night dinner reservation and were immediately seated.  This place was hopping, so reservations are recommended.  To our delight Diane, our delightful star server from our previous visit was working!\n\nWe brought a special bottle of wine that we had been waiting to enjoy for quite a while.  They only charge a $10 corkage fee and welcome you to bring your own if you wish.  \n\nAlright now here's where it gets really good!  Enter the four course Chef's Table menu; it's not a menu per say, as it's 100% unique to every customer's palate.  It's more of a concept.  When we told our server that we wanted to try the the Chef's Table she asked us for our preferences, food allergies, etc. Chef Marc takes this info and hand picks 4 courses meant to please your taste buds.  At $50pp with optional $20 wine pairings, it's such a steal.  It's nothing like many strip restaurants where 4 courses = 4 bites.  This is the highest quality food with generous portions.  If you already know that you want to try the Chef's Table, go ahead and let them know when you make your reservation to save some time, otherwise it takes a little longer than ordering from the regular menu.\n\nFirst course we were treated to a seared octopus salad with green apples, carrots, celery, and chickpeas.  This was my favorite dish of the night.  The octopus had been marinated, which made it extremely tender and completely infused with flavor.  Since we brought our own wine, we didn't opt to do the parings.  They are so thoughtful that brought us a small glass of Chenin blanc to have with the octopus, as the wine we brought wasn't ideal with this dish.\n\nSecond course we enjoyed pappardelle pasta with olive oil, sauteed mushrooms, and thick generous chunks of prosciutto.  If I had this to do over, I might have saved half of my pasta to bring home, because it is extra filling.\n\nThird course entrees - #1 was grouper with ratatouille and broccolini.  #2 Veal saltimbocca.  Both were delicious!\n\nFourth course was rum cake, choc cake with raspberry sauce, the most delicious canoli ever, and fresh strawberries and blackberries.  Per our request they happily prepared it in a to go box for us.  \n\nThis is a wonderful date spot that I can't recommend enough.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating and the food is absolute perfection."

The decor inside is intimate and different. There are couches in the middle if you prefer to eat your meal there. The tables are spread around the couch area and the deli is up front. It's not unusual to see cans of Italian ingredients on shelves around you. The restaurant decor has real character and the food is pretty tasty too! \n\nMy husband and I started off with the House Salad. It had organic greens, ricotta cheese, pieces of pear and balsamic dressing. The ricotta has a light sweet taste to it. This is the best ricotta I've ever tasted was so soft that it was easy to mix it into my salad. The ingredients all complimented one another and tasted fabulous! \n\nI ordered the Truffle Mac and Cheese dinner. I've had this dish before at Smith & Wollenskys so I knew the taste I was looking for unfortunately I didn't find it. The Mac and Cheese here is a bit bland. \n\nMy husband ordered the Parpadelle with Spicy Sausage. It came with thick home made noodles . I tasted some of his dish and it was really good! He finished everything on the plate! \n\nWe finished with dessert I had the Lemon Cello cake which was huge! I had to take half of it home. It was yummy! My husband had the Rum Cake which he finished too fast that I didn't have time to take a picture of it. I had a small piece and I thought that was also delightful but the portion is small compared to my cake. We enjoyed Cafe Mocha with our dessert which was very relaxing. \n\nIf you come here make sure you are not short on time. It's best to just relax ,eat and enjoy!"

She was a little taken back when we first entered to what seemed a little less classy than what she anticipated.  But, soon all went well when the lights were dimmed and the waiter recommended a Pinot Grigio that was smooth and delicious to be followed by a veal saltimbuco for her and chicken parmigiana for me.  Both dishes the best we've ever had.  We spent a memorable evening, and now count ourselves as enduring fans."

Ended up getting spaghetti Bologna's and a chicken parmesan sandwich as well as a loaf of fresh italian bread and an antipasti salad.  The prices actually seemed to go down (at least stay the same) as they were in the last 2 years.  The food and service are still excellent and you can really taste the quality that using primo ingredients and passion that chef Marc uses in his food.  It is superior to every other italian food I have tried from some so-called \"italian\" restaurants.  The portions are huge, and while it isn't cheap, you get what you pay for and the deli prices are no more than what you pay at the grocery store for deli meats and cheeses as well as bread.  It is also the only place I know that sells actual fresh pasta.  Yum"

This was a hit.\n\nWe then split the Parma salad. This was a hit and a miss. The salad itself was a hit. It had a nice balance of flavors, colors, and textures. It was composed of artichoke hearts, walnuts, olives, arugula, Parmesan, and a vinaigrette. The miss was that we weren't given a serving utensil so it was hard to dish the salad onto our plates.\n\nFor our entrees we had the spinach manicotti and the truffle mac and cheese.\n\nThe spinach manicotti was a definite hit. It was my favorite food of the evening. It was good and cheesy. It was topped with a flavorful yet delicate sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\nUnfortunately the truffle mac and cheese was not nearly as good. It was too salty and watery. This was a miss.\n\nWe decided to finish our meal with homemade chocolate gelato. We asked for one to share. They served it in two small dishes. My wife's portion came out melted and looked more like chocolate pudding. Mine was solid so I gave her some of mine so she could eat (not just drink) some of the gelato. It was decent but a little grainy.\n\nI'm a little torn on how many stars to give. The hits were really great but the misses tarnished the overall meal. I think I'll go with 3 stars."

I opted to check it out for lunch and took my food to go, but it seems like a pretty nice place to dine in as well.\n\nI got the meatball sandwich. I'm a meatball sandwich aficionado. This one came on a ciabatta, which was actually a really good choice for this sandwich. They dressed it up with a little oil and parmesan on top, and the bread was crusty enough to hold up to the inside of the sandwich and soft enough to easily bite into and enjoy. Really good bread, which I believe is the most important element in a good sandwich.\n\nI opted for the large sandwich, which is 10\", and when I opened it up, I was pretty disappointed to find that there were only 2 meatballs, each cut in half. They're pretty decent sized balls, but definitely not on the generous side to say the least. There's lots of tasty mozzarella cheese, which was a big plus because you could tell it wasn't that cheap stuff that you get at some places. This cheese had some flavor to it. \n\nThere was a perfect amount of sauce on it for me, too. Any less, and there wouldn't be enough to soak into the bread, and any more, there'd be a lot overflowing all over. The sauce had a slightly sweet flavor, with plenty of seasoning, the strongest being garlic and oregano. I thought it complemented the meatballs very well.\n\nFinally, the meatballs. Really nice flavor to them. Seems to be the theme here, but you could tell they used good ingredients and have good technique because everything was thoughtfully seasoned. The balls were on the firm side, and the meat was ground very fine. Instead of being a little crumbly, the balls were solid. Not a bad thing, but it just depends on how you like them. Personally, I prefer softer meatballs, but these weren't to the point where they tasted dry.\n\nIt ended up to be plenty of food, but lose a star for bang for buck- there's gotta be more meatball!"

Just to put this in terms that everyone can understand... imagine if you will, a large toilet full to the brim in a dive bar somewhere.

My husband ordered a hot Italian beef sandwich which comes with an au jus and I got a hot parma.  My sandwich was solid...no complaints, exactly as described.  My husband's sandwich was TDF...I am not kidding, I don't eat bread, but he convinced me to take a full bite after he dipped it in the au jus...it was way more than I expected. So many textures and flavors...juicy meat, with a few tangy peppercinos, crusty bread, melted provolone, then dipped in au jus...PERFECTION!!!  Being east coast born and raised, reminds me of Jersey and Philly Italian joints, family we loved and ate at often.  Services was exceptional and definitely run by people that care about presenting good food and service.\n\nI cannot wait to come back for dinner.  The environment is like an Italian familiy's living room...there are tables, but also couches to sit back and relax, possibly with a few glasses of wine.  You definitely can tell the wine menu is carefully selected...it isn't huge, but definitely well thought out to please as many customers but also show off Italian wines.  How many places do you know that serve Vermentino by the glass?  Love it."

This isn't only my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, but my favorite restaurant of all time.  Chef Marc, is to me, a culinary god.  I feel so honored by his humility, because I think he could be a head chef at the worlds most finest restaurants, cooking for the most exclusive clientele.  But instead, he allows common people to experience the finest in food and drink.  Thank you Chef Marc.  \n\nI highly recommend the chef's table.   Four courses with or without wine pairings. It is a bit more pricey than most can afford for a casual dinner, but if you want to impress a date, this will truly be a winner.  I took the g/f there for her birthday and it was a life changing experience....  No really....  Life changing!  Chef Marc creates a custom four course meal just for you.  Our custom menu included char grilled octopus with apple, carrot and celery.  At first we though it would be chewy, but it surprisingly was not at all.  It had the texture of a moist piece of chicken breast.  Delicious!!!  Next up was the gnocchi bolognese.  The gnocchi was incredible and the bolognese was amazing.  Our third corse was a dry aged rib eye, done el-chico style.  If I had to choose the final meal of my life, this would be it.  It was as they say in Hawaii, \"broke da mouth\" good.  Without question, the finest entree I have ever had...  That is no exaggeration.  The final course was a three parter, with rum cake, tiramisu  and cannoli.  I was so full, but I could not stop eating until all the food was gone.  \n\nThanks again Chef Marc.  I would also like to thank our server Tracy. He has always been so exceptionally kind to us whenever we go.  He is the type of server that would bend over backwards just to make sure we have the most enjoyable experience one could have."

To me, it was good, but it wasn't spectacular; probably because I do not have too much experience in escarole.  The bf liked it, and I liked it enough. \n\nSea urchin pasta - YUMMY!  I have never had sea urchin pasta before, and it was delicious!  The squid ink homemade spaghetti was so tasty and tasted \"oceanic\" in a good way.  The sea urchin was fresh and it was perfectly tossed into the pasta.  I say tossed because it was the perfect temperature from the heat of the pasta and not cooked down.  I could have eaten the entire dish by myself and intend to upon my next visit!\n\nWe picked the chicken for our protein.  It was a huge plate of chicken that was enough to feed three!  The chicken was bedded with polenta, and it was the perfect combination.  We had as much as we can but had to pack the rest home.  \n\nAs for dessert, we had the rum cake, and it was pretty good.  Not too sweet and not too \"rummy\", which was a small problem for the bf.  \n\nI am definitely looking forward to the next dining experience at Parma and introducing this restaurant to my friends and family!"

We only asked about their olive oil on their display, and the server, which I forgot his name, brought and opened four different kinds of olive oil for us to taste together with more sliced bread. We bought four olive oils and lady fingers to go.\n\nAs we're out and at the neighborhood store, I looked at the receipt and noticed that they didn't charge us for our take home goodies. As a good samaritan, we went back to the store and told that guy about it. We paid the goodies and he gave us extra treat!\n\nWell, we can just ran away and pretend that our goodies might be  free.

In fact, we arrived just before 5 PM as they were setting things up for the evening's dinner service.  Tracy, our server, seated us and then went to get menus, dishes, and silverware.  While he was gone, Chef Marc came over and discussed the offerings for the night's menu.\n\nBy the time Tracy came back with the menus, I already knew what I was having but my wife needed time to decide.  We ordered a house salad to share.  The salad had an oil and vinegar dressing and it had a dollop of fresh ricotta to enjoy. I got the salmon special which was a beautiful piece of salmon seasoned beautifully and cooked perfectly.  The salmon was on a bed of garlic spinach and some homemade pappardelle dyed with cuttlefish ink.  Excellent pasta, too.  My wife got chicken marsala that came with a side of rigatoni with red sauce.  She enjoyed it and I tasted the sauce and it was quite flavorful\n\nFor desert, I asked Tracy about the size of the chocolate mousse cake and he said it was large and easily shared.  I was somewhat crestfallen because I wanted to enjoy one of the wonderful cannoli I had when I was here for the UYE.  I told Tracy I'd order some cannoli to take home if the cake didn't fill me up.  When he brought our cake, there was one of their small versions of cannoli as a complimentary treat--proof that you can have your cake and cannoli, too!  It was very much appreciated!\n\nTracy was an excellent server.  Chef Marc is passionate about his food and he's a joy to talk to.  I'm looking forward to our next UYE here so I can have another of his 5 course special meals he designs for the Yelp group."

So finally we have had the time and went to Parma!\n\nWe walk in and see the chalkboard menus and there's a little store and lounge area. They have some oldie music playing and  have some nice artwork. Really like the vibe when you walk in. We take a seat and our waitress comes by and gets our drink orders. Apparently I think they print the menu everyday or something because there was at least one fish item that was crossed off. It must have been a hit. The waitress can tell you how everything is made what their favorite dishes are. I love when the chef takes time to explain so waiters/waitresses can give info to first time customers.\n\nI order the Papardelle Bolognese, my friend orders Eggplant Parmesan, and her boyfriend orders something Riggies. They start us off with some fresh bread omg it was so good we had two little loafs before our food arrived. It was so good we couldn't say no. The food comes out and the smell is sooo amazing. I loved the bolognese sauce. The papardelle is prepared perfectly! The flavors of everything comes together. My friend had the eggplant and that was so yummy. She is picky about her eggplant parm and this is the first place other then one other place in Vegas that does the eggplant parm how she likes it. Her boyfriend got his spicy so I didn't try( I know I wimped out lol). He loved it and my friend said it was really good.\n\nOK so after the food we take a look at the desserts and decide we have just enough room in our belly's for it. I get the Tiramisu,my friend gets the chocolate mousse cake, and her boyfriend gets the cannoli. OMG dessert heaven! The tiramisu was so good with just the right amount of sweetness. The chocolate mousse cake is the chocolate lovers best friend. Different layers of chocolate gets my mouth watering. The cannoli was really good also. My friend said it's his favorite cannoli he has had in a long time.\n\nI give Parma 4 stars! I'm a fan of the place. This is the type of place I would go for Italian food, celebration dinners, or that romantic evening with your loved one. They have great food with great service. I definitely want to  try their lunch next!"

Our party of five went for a midweek lunch during the typical lunch hour. There was no crowd to speak of, yet the service was a little slow and it took a while for the food to arrive after ordering.  I ordered the Parma sandwich, as did a few others in the group. The meats and fixings were mighty tasty, but the bread left my jaw feeling like I had just gone a few rounds. Yo Adrian, my jaw hurts! The sandwich was ala carte. Not even a pickle on the side. I opted for a side salad to compliment my Parma. The waitress recommended a chopped salad. It was outstanding, however, I guess I missed the eight dollar price on the menu. Holy Cow. I left a little disappointed, with a sore jaw and twenty-two dollars lighter in the wallet. I will give it another shot, but more likely for a date night dinner and not a midweek lunch."

We since then come back a few times and even brought family from Ca and most recently, our family from the Netherlands. \n\nEverything is fresh, and pastas are made by hand here. The menus change based on what is seasonal and I highly appreciate that. Don't worry though, all the favorites aren't on the menu they hand you but on the chalk boards on the wall. They can make you just about anything you desire of the classics. \n\nThis is what we've had (so far) : \n\nAntipasto Salad - very plentiful with greens, olives, slices of cheese and charcuterie. The different salamis were delicious and you can tell were quality. Standard dish, but good as far as salad goes. \n\nLasagna - My MILs favorite thing. First time it was good and very heavy on the ricotta, this recent time they touted that it was a new style, a Tuscan style without the ricotta, layers of meaty saucy goodness and the MIL swooned over it. I took a bite and it was fantastic. \n\nBolognese- have had a few times and prefer pappardelle noodles. This is one of the best bologneses I've had. This has been ordered several times and is the group favorite. \n\nRed sauces- Go for Sunday sauce if you like a nice rich tasting red sauce. Marinara here is solidly bright and bold flavored if you don't want a meaty sauce. If you like sausages or meatballs with that, theirs are good. I'm a sausage person myself, but grandma likes the meatballs. \n\nBF and I tried a seasonal, Snapper with uni hollandaise, pea risotto and broccolini. The fish was fresh and cooked nicely, and the flavors of everything with it was in harmony and not overpowering the snapper. We are risotto freaks and cook it properly at home. Pea risotto it was overcooked, but still good flavors. \n\nSome of our guests had other things like the sweet potato \"bishops hats\" in brown butter, the puttanesca, etc and all reported back positively. \n\nDesserts- had the cannolis which are quite solid and I am very picky about them. Kalhua cake is buttery and tasty. Tiramisu is standard, but solid and not overly soaked. Chocolate cake was nice. Pizelles aren't made in house I dont think but offer it at the deli case and they were good if you like the sweeter vanilla kind. MIL and I both prefer the anise flavored ones. \n\nThey start out any meal with some hot from the oven bread with garlic, butter and herbs on it! Definitely very good! My in laws aren't a fan of the olive oil/balsamic dip you make your self from jars at the table so ask for butter if you're like them.\n\nService here is always very good. We get the same waiter everytime and he does such a good job of explaining the dishes, specials and answering our questions. While sometimes its been slow because it was very busy, it is always courteous and not for their lack of trying to be everyone at once. We don't mind waiting for good food when it comes from a place that feels like home. \n\nOf course, we have taken home cheese, pasta, and sauces from the deli and the prices are great for the quality. Pastas are around $4.50 a lb. depending on the kind, raviolis and gnocchi types I believe are around $9 a lb. I cannot remember the sauce prices, but I will update next time. \n\nLOVE this place. I cannot recommend this spot enough. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in town. I don't throw that statement around lightly. \n\nCan't wait for Nelsons Chefs Tasting UYE!"

            "review": "One of the best things about joining Yelp for me was finding Chef Marc again. Years ago, I was a regular at his previous restaurant, Marc's World Cuisine, and enjoyed many fantastic creations of his culinary genius (truffled lobster mashed potatoes, anyone?!) So, after friends convinced me that my career PR/writing + Yelp was a no brainier, signed on to find Marc (yay!) and realize I'd missed Nelson Q's Epic Mangia UYE (boo!)\n\nAlmost immedeately, the family went over and Marc (and several waiters) greeted us like old friends. Dad is Sicilian and a hard sell on Italian food, but Marc had him by the time bread and the antipasto --with Black Label Proscuitto di Parma -- was enthusiastically enjoyed. All pasta is house made and absolute perfection: since April I've had the chance to sample more than a dozen varities and the orchiette (little ears) from Mangia UYE/Nelson's Birthday in July stand out as do the Bishops's Hats from the same meal (and Tien's UYE Chef's Table/Pairing) for degree of difficulty and execution in making them light as air. Before I expound upon the wonders of Chef's Table, please note that though the regular menu changes daily, Marc will make just about anything you desire if he has the ingredients on hand. Dad loves his eggplant parmigiana, Mom is a big fan of Shrimp Scampi and he whips it up whenever they ask. Service and customer satisfaction matter here, big time. \n\nOne of my dearest friends has lived all over the world (just moved backed to Vegas after an 8yr absence) as both an Air Force brat and wife, asked for my suggestion for the best spot to celebrate her husband making Lt Col? They came from their condo on the Strip and even though Marc was off, Ciro took amazing care of us. Before ordering appetizers. she threw down with \"I am an octopus snob, this better be good\" it was amazing (they marinate it before charring it perfectly) they are now regulars, too.\n\n\nLeaving out Wednesday night Pizza would be a crime! This is the day Marc fires up the custom oven outside and makes authentic VPN pizza to order. Thin, charred crust Napoli Za arrives in 90 seconds: I suggest Margerita with post oven farm fresh egg and arugula; on the fly he created White with scungili and clams which I still dream about. Go early and make reservations: they sell out. \n\nNow, for the Chef's Table option: for $50 you get a five course meal chosen by Chef Marc (he will follow any dietary restrictions with notice) which brings his ingenuity and world travels together to come up with mind blowing dishes. Every possible effort is made to use local and Farmer's Market ingredients combined with his skill and imagination, you'd be hard pressed to find a meal this good at four times the price. At just $20 the wine pairing is also a steal for oenophiles and novices alike.  During the meal, Marc talks about his inspiration for each dish, the source of ingredients sharing with a passion that is contagious. \n\nThe service is exceptional, I nominated them for Service & Server (my beloved Criztiano) in NPR's Desert Companion Magazine \"Best of Las Vegas Dining 2012\" issue, thrilled to share my near decade long experiences with fellow foodies. Marc's was also chosen Favorite Local Resaurant by one of their critics, and he was humbled by this honor; proudly showing Mom and I the plaque he received hanging on the wall. Criztiano remembers everything my family enjoys, down to an obscure canned eggplant appetizer included in their impressive imported deli/salumeria sections my Dad loves. Which brings me to the final reasons I love this place: the salumeria has fantastic imported charcuterie (the eponymous and beyond) and cheeses we order ahead for pickup to make holiday antipasto. Desserts are spot on: mini cannoli, Limoncello cake and the whipped cream/local honey/cannoli shell/berry delight he created for Nelson's last UYE are divine. \n\nParma is a true food lovers gem: clean, fresh ingredients elevated by a master. Don't take my word for it: try it. They open at 10am daily and lunch is a good time and quieter than bustling dinner (suggest reservations) or sign up for a coveted seat at Nelson Q's Mangia UYE on 22 February. You'll be glad you did. \n\n\nYelp 100 Challenge (9 of 100)"

Hands down the finest Italian food I've had in ages. The fruita de mar was amazing loaded with clams,mussels, calamari and fresh fish in an amazing red sauce with fresh basil. So balanced as not to over power the fish but hearty enough to bring alive the flavors of the homemade linguine . Dessert, tiramisu was fantastic. Subtle hits of anise in the mascarpone cheese. \nEven the cappuccino is so good you do not need to sweeten., \nBottom line. Munge!"

We had heard that Alfredo's of Rome, who had recently closed their Orlando location, was going to open in Planet Hollywood in 2009.  Well, it didn't happen.  No Alfredo's.  So I checked out yelp* to see what other Italian places there were in the neighborhood we were staying besides Buca da beppo.  Hmmmm, a place called Parma came up with a solid five stars from seven reviews, and it was right around the corner from us.  So, off we went.  We weren't terribly hungry and just ordered pasta - spaghetti carbonara for me and lasagna for my DH.  Water and bread with oil completed the deal.  What can I say?  The bread was top notch, and the pasta was heavenly.  I've been to Italy and have had a lot of spaghetti carbonara over there, this easily topped any I had ever tasted in Italy.  It might even be better than my [Italian] best friend's spaghetti carbonara.  Okay, it is better, but she can't know that.\n\nSoooo, that leads us to our next experience.  Believe me, my DH and I are incredibly loyal when we find a place we like, so we were back just two nights later.  Walked in about 5:30pm with no reservations, not worried about getting seated.  Chef Marc himself came over and that was when we learned to our dismay that he was featuring a special Christmas Eve seafood menu.  It seemed like a bargain - a seven-course all seafood/fish meal for only $55.  Unfortunately, as I explained to the Chef, neither of us like seafood.  The odd fish dish maybe, but not an entire menu.  We were just going to quietly leave, no hard feelings, but Chef Marc could not have been more wonderful.  Rather than focusing on what he had planned to provide to customers that night, he immediately understood what our needs were.  He explained he could do a little something for us, some Caesar's salad, a couple of pasta dishes?  We smiled, we sat.  This time, I had some wine (whatever red they were serving that night was fabulous).  The Caesar's salad was top notch.  Not too heavy on the garlic, and the parmesan cheese was great.  I had the vegetarian pasta, and my DH had the spaghetti with sausage.  He is still raving about it.  He swears it is the best pasta he has ever had in his life.  Hands down.  So, between the two of us on two separate nights, easily the best of class.\n\nFor a treat we ordered the rum cake for dessert.  Ohhhhh yessss, it had been soaking for quite some time in Captain Morgan's finest.  \n\nI'm trying to get over how sad it is that I am not in Las Vegas more frequently in order to dine at Parma whenever I want.  For now, my DH and I have to satisfy ourselves with memories of two fine meals and anticipation of our next visit.  To paraphrase you know who, \"we'll be back!\""

The homemade pasta enveloped around spinach topped with mozzarella, blanketed with a perfect pink basil sauce was perfection. \n\nMy husband ordered the Parpadelle Bolognese and shared it with our toddler daughter, and both of them practically licked their plates clean.  My husband also ordered a side a hot sausage which was absolutely delicious. \n\nMy cousin originally wanted the lasagna, but they had run out, so our waitress recommended the Baked Pasta Fazoletti which was like a deconstructed lasagna.  This was my favorite dish of the day and one I will order all to myself next time. \n\nMy cousin's husband could not decide on the many delicious sandwiches so he ordered 2 half sandwiches and was very pleased with both.  \n\nThe service was OK. It wasn't the warmest, but they were attentive and our iced tea glasses were never empty- and that is what counts.  Besides, the food alone is worthy of the 5 stars and I can't wait to be back to try the dinner menu.  So glad that we ventured in because it is now added to our list of faves!"

The menu changes daily leaving the consumer to try different things as they frequent the restaurant. The entrees are always fresh and the home-made pastas are delicious. Worth the drive to come here and indulge. There is also a deli with high quality fresh-cut meats and cheeses!"

I went with a few friends:  I had the linguini fruitti di mar (seafood pasta in a red sauce), and my friends had the pork chops and veal parmigiano.  The service was nothing short of perfection, because I altered my dish by asking for this and that, e.g., I want chili peppers, fresh basil, etc.  What can I say? I'm demanding, and boy does Parma deliver!  I don't remember the name of our waiter, because he was very attentive and jovial. \n\n My guests loved their dishes.  The friend who ordered the pork chop was impressed with how large the pork chops were.  It looked like it could feed a family of four, and he definitely licked his plate clean.  For my dish, I enjoyed it, but I would have liked to see more fish in my fruitti di mare, fewer mussels than clams (my dish was swimming in mussels), and more shrimp and calamari.  \n\nSince I love seafood and always order seafood pasta wherever I go, I would say Parma's linguini fruitti di mare is worthy of 3.5 stars.  It was definitely very good and tasty for the price, but for me, the service made my experience worthy of 5 stars. All in all, I'd definitely go back there again next time I'm in Vegas...maybe after I'm done dieting.  lol"

I am VERY glad I did!\n\nStarted off with charred octopus and the escargot with truffle butter .  \n\nThe octopus was very tender and had lots of flavor, nice burnt edges, adding great texture and flavor.  The escargot was super tender and packed with flavor, and the bread that was soaked in the butter and sauce was amazing, but the dry edges of the bread were a little hard and distracting.\n\nFor dinner we went with the U10 sea scallops with squid ink, and the shrimp fra diavolo.  The scallops were buttery tender, great flavor, and the squid ink was a nice secret ingredient....weird, but worked well!  There were four of them, and all were excellent.  Just eat some breath mints afterwards lol.\n\nBut the real winner here for the night was the Shrimp Fra Diavolo.  I LOVE spicy food....I have never heard of this dish!  This dish was AMAZING.  There was so much flavor packed in every bite, I wish there was more broccoli on the plate.  Why?  Because the little broccoli are saturated with all the goodness of the plate, and hide tons of it inside their leaves.  Explosions in your mouth....seriously!  Garlic, oil, herbs, everything...nice!\n\nAnd to finish, we went with an almond chocolate mousse.  Super light and \"fluffy\" insides, this dessert packed tons of chocolate flavor in each bite.\n\nSo is it all perfect here?  Food wise, absolutely.  Completely different experience than the last....in a good way.\n\nBut I got the same server as last time.  My service was slow again, wine going dry the whole night for more than 5min+ at a time, I waited to be asked for dessert after my plates were pulled, for over 10min.  After my dessert plate was pulled, I was given my check almost 15min later.  Good thing I was not in a hurry to be anywhere.  Nice guy, but not what one looks for in a server...sorry.\n\nBut even this server could not ruin our night.  The food was exceptional, and I WILL be back again....although I will be requesting another server next time around."

Step inside and the setting is kind of romantic with low lighting, intimate seating and a cozy lounge. You'll forget that someone rushing to get toilet paper at K-Mart almost just mowed you down in the parking lot.\n\nThe food here is something to be celebrated. The menu here is a combination of main staples and specials of the day which keeps things fresh and interesting. More importantly, everything here just tastes like love! Who says that? I just said it! I brought my mom here, the pickiest eater I've ever met besides the 9 year old I nannied for in college, and she had not one complaint. Only the second time this has happened....in my life. On our visit, we had the beet salad which was enough to split between two people. The beets were fresh and we got a variety of colors which made for a pretty presentation. The dressing that came with it was simple but really brought all of the flavors of the salad together. My mom got some kind of cod and I got the pork chop \"el chico\" which was basically an enormous, quality pork chop with a sweet/hot pepper sauce. Like I said, my mom is the worst dining companion ever because she hates everything, but she  liked her fish so much that she was making audible noises of satisfaction when eating, which was embarrassing and satisfying at the same time. (I love to say \"I told you so\" when it comes to picking restaurants.)\n\nI know some would consider it blasphemy to go to a place like this and not order pasta, but I didn't on my first visit. So when I came back with some friends, I dipped into their pasta selection with chicken riggies, ravioli and wild mushroom papardelle. It was hard to pick a favorite, but because I am partial to meat in my pasta, I was really surprised by how flavorful and complex the papardelle was-so amazing! I've had freshly made pasta before, but Parma has the best execution, cooking the pasta to perfection and not over or under-saucing it. \n\n The staff is friendly and eager to share recommendations. They have a decent wine list and if you have a favorite you'd rather bring instead the corkage fee is only $10! \n\nWhat I like so much about this place is that their non-pasta dishes shine just as much as their pasta dishes- so hard to find when it comes to Italian food.  I'm so excited to have found a place that just loves to make incredible food as much as I love to eat it and can't wait to go back!"

The meats were true Italian & from what I could tell included ham, salami, pepperoni, & gabagol (not sure I spelled this correct but it's an Italian type ham.) It also includes an olive spread with cheese slices of provolone & mortadella. This was topped with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, olive oil & balsamic vinegar. The bread was crusty & wonderful. True Italian style. My daughter had the Campania sandwich which included fresh buffalo mozzarella, fire roasted peppers, presto basil, sliced tomatoes, with balsamic dressing. She said it was amazing & the cost was also $6.25. She enjoyed a bowl of pasta fagiola soup which is Italian white bean & pasta for $7.00. She said it was very good & she had only had better in Italy. The soft drinks cost  $2.50 each. We shared a cannolli for $4.00 & it was wonderful. We also took home ricotta cheesecake & tiramisu each costing $7.00 & both were great. We had a hard time deciding what to order as many items on the menu looked fantastic. This is a place we will be back to as it has very authentic Italian foods."

We were excited because we hadn't been there for awhile and had bragged about how great the food was. Well we got a totally different experience. We went inside and only 2 other tables were there, but it took the waitress over 10 minutes to give us our bread basket and drinks. When we ordered dinner, I had ordered the red snapper. I took one bite and it was NOT fresh. The taste was awful. We never send food back, but did because it was inedible. We let the waitress know and proceeded to look at the menu to order something different when the owner Marc came to our table with a raw red snapper. He told us that the fish was fresh and had just came in. I politely told him that our fish did not taste fresh, but very fishy. He walked away while I was in mid-sentence. My problem wasn't so much about the food, but how we were treated.  Rather than coming over to our table and apologizing and seeing if we were interested in something else, the owner was defensive and insinuated that we were lying about the food. We spent over $100.00 on lunch and I didn't even eat! For that reason I am giving the place a 1star and won't be back there again. It's a shame."

I had seen this restaurant on the food network as an undercover show and was very inspired by the owner that he would ever consider keeping an employee that was stealing from him but that's a whole different deal. Before going I had looked on yelp and their web site at the menu and reviews so I was really looking forward to going to a good Italian restaurant for a change. How ever that did not happen . My wife and i left California a couple of hours early to hopefully have lunch and check into our hotel as we pulled the parking lot the building seemed a little smaller than expected and the parking lot did not seem full at all we arrived at about 12:30 pm as we walked in we were not greeted by any employees working in fact the exact opposite we were totally ignored as one of the waiters walked within  five feet of us and said nothing at that point we started to look around the restaurant a little closer and noticed at least ten tables that had not been cleared with only about five or six tables being used after waiting about five min to get noticed and tired of the chef yelling that orders were up we left very disappointed really too bad we really wanted to try there food long way to drive for nothing we ere there.

I had spaghetti bolonaise - a very traditional preparation of it, with carrots and peas in the sauce. Very homespun Italian. It was great but the portion could have been a titch bigger for eleven bucks. (This was lunch, I have no idea about the dinner.)\n\nI would give this four stars, because it was good but did not rock my world. However, the customer service here is great. They really went out of their way - and I generally think that what Las Vegas dining truly excels at is good customer service. So to top that expectation at a local joint is really, truly five stars worth. Glad I went, will go back and try other offerings to give a better review of the food."

There are a lot of ethnic restaurants here but I have not found too \nmany that I would go back to again and again. Parma is definitely going to be a return spot. My husband and I ate there last night and were extremely happy with our meals and the service. As soon as we entered we were sat and our waitress, Diane was with us within a few minutes. When we arrived it was \"Dinner time\" and neither of us were too interested in anything on the dinner menu we both really just wanted sandwiches which would be considered their lunch menu.  Diane was more than accommodating, I ordered the Chicken Parmigian sandwich (which is only available in a large) and my husband got a large turkey. Both sandwiches were amazingly delicious. The turkey was flavorful and moist and the chicken parm sandwich was huge (I only ate half) it was hot, cheesy and had the other diners eyeballing it. For desert a cannoli, which was also amazing. Don't hesitate to try this place it so worth it!"

Large in size primarily due to the presence of the retail store and deli but with ample seating for guests in both the dining room and small lounge I was greeted first by the man who would serve as my waiter and then by a manager who seemed to know every other patron in the restaurant, both inquiring as to whether it was my first visit and offering suggestions regarding the menu - some accepted and some discarded in order to focus on items I knew to suit my fancy, each and every one a lesson in rustic Italian cooking with top quality ingredients, great depth of flavor, and ample portion.  Beginning first with hot garlic bread paired with olive oil and balsamic before progressing to an even more garlicky plate featuring eight tender snails on crusty bread with rich sauce I was shocked when the next two plates proved to be even better, one a 'salad' of crisp spinach topped with tender portabellas baked in parmesan cheese sauce and the other a pile of dainty potato gnocchi resting in smoky pork cream brightened up by fresh double shucked peas.  With each plate undoubtedly heavy yet finely balanced with no ingredient unnecessary or overwhelming the others it was with a touch of sadness that I realized I only had room for one dessert but deferring the tiramisu and strawberry cake for a later date I do not regret my decision to order the baba one bit, two slices of boozy rum cake lightly sweetened with confectioners' sugar and a ripe strawberry the only garnish necessary...plus a cannoli filled a la minute on the house, as though I needed further food or reason to return in the near future."

You can sit at a table or there are couches with coffee tables you can enjoy your dinner at as well.  The wine list is VERY reasonable.  We had the Tobin James \"Notorious\" Cabernet.

Skip Olive Garden and go here! \n\nSure it's a little out of the way but it's totally worth it. I've been here 3 times and every time my boyfriend and I split an order of the gnocchi. I've had the chicken parm and a few other chicken dishes - all cooked to perfection! \n\n*Side tip. If there are a few things you want to try why not split it? Every meal I've gotten they've allowed us to split. \n\nI was going to knock them down a peg for the last meal I had there. We wanted lasagna but was told it was unavailable. Oddly enough their 'deconstructed' lasagna dish was available. It was messy to eat and came out cold. \n\nBUT this review's saving grace is the consistent service and relaxed atmosphere. Servers are always quick with water and bread. Ask them a question about a dish and they usually know the answer and then some. Tables are spaced nicely. You can relax on the couch with a glass of wine or push tables together to accommodate a party of 8. Most of the ingredients, pastas and breads you can purchase at the deli counter."

I've been here twice in the past week, and I'm meeting up with them tomorrow at the Tivoli Village Farmers Market.\n\nIt all started with the antipasto.. hot capicola, peppercorn flecked mortadella, calabrese and genoa salami sliced paper thin, the best pepperoni I've ever set taste buds on, tavern style ham, provolone cheese, and the proscuitto... best. Ever. In the middle is a green salad dressed simply with balsamic and olive oil, topped with garbanzo beans and thinly sliced red onion. This plate.. which is huge.. is only $14 (for two people, addl $4 p/p after). Paired with the amazing hot bread they serve brushed with garlic oil and parmesan, I wish I could make a meal out of this alone. I say wish, because it's just not that easy here. When Chef Marcus comes over to explain the specials.. you're in for the long haul.\n\nTheir Pappardelle with Bolognese is quite possibly the most comforting food I've ever eaten. It tastes like a hug. Or your favorite sweater on a cold day, if your favorite sweater was perfectly al dente. Perfectly toothsome, all the pasta here is homemade, and the sauce was thick and rich, you could see bits of carrot and peas.\n\nThe escargot was tender, garlicky, lemony, not gritty, but very very salty. Whoever was making it that night certainly had a heavy had with the salt but it did not deter me from using the crostinis they serve with it to soak up some of that sauce. I love salt. The menu described this dish as having truffle oil in it, but the only earthy notes I got were from the escargot itself.\n\nThe charred octopus.. wow! I didn't know octopus could be this tender. It was almost like a scallop. Chef Marcus cooks the tentacles in wine and beer for almost three hours before finishing it in the oven to give it that slight char. The cabbage slaw on the bottom is very acidic (lemon) and it a nice contrast to the soft sweetness of the octopus. This is served with sliced apple and celery.\n\nThe uni with linguine (special) was delicious, and a unique offering here in Vegas. The sauce is creamy with red chili flakes and shaved garlic. The taste of the uni was perfect and fresh, like clean ocean water, and there was a lot of uni in this which just melted in your mouth. The only complaint on this was that the garlic was a little burnt and lent a bitterness to an otherwise perfect dish.\n\nIf you haven't been here yet, you should make it a point to go soon. I've only been here for dinner, but would love to try their lunch offerings.  Their menu changes often on the chef's whim. The deli case is always impressive and they also have some Italian dry goods for sale, as well as homemade pastas to take home.\n\nWednesday nights ~5:30pm-9:00pm is pizza night and they do neopolitan style thin crust pizzas. They're also at Tivoli Village on Saturdays selling their homemade pastas and amazing parmesano reggiano (best I've found in Vegas) until 1pm."

I better get more than just one extra basket! \n\nReading many reviews and being a big fan of Novecento, this was disappointing. The service lacked incredibly!! No smile, no introduction, no recommendations!! For my first time and with all these reviews you would think they'd have some pride to talk to you about the place and the must haves.\n\nWe started with the Parma salad... WEAK! It was absolutely boring and I tasted more olive juice than an actual dressing. Next we had the Greens Juliana it was so salty, that the Parma salad could've used some of that! For entree's we ordered Chicken Parmesan- Overcooked and boring, that dish came out and I stared and said wow.. that looks pathetic. I took a bite of the side pasta... the most overcooked noodles you could get with what canned tomato sauce?! Add some basil or something to bump it up! If I need to put salt on pasta... WHAT?! Mind blown. I ordered the Mushroom Parpadelle- bland bland oh did I mention bland? With pieces of I believe pancetta it could save this dish but no.. It fails. It was almost as if they just cooked some mushrooms and dumped it on the noodles without really creating a \"sauce.\" \n\nMy moms been talking about going here for months..

Our server here at this place was of course nice. hehehe\n\nI like the deli set up. It gives you this type of vibe that it is owned by one of \"them wise guys\" and they do some illegal dealings in the back of this place, you know? I LOVE THAT! Oh I love their wine too. Get some wine!!!! I had the colossi rosso with some pasta. \n\nFOOD is GREAT. I love the mushroom with spinach and cream sauce appetizer. I wish I knew the recipe since this place is like 3 hours away from my place.\nIt is far from the Vegas strip. Restaurants in Vegas are overrated. I like this alot. Good service and nice ambience. I would not say it is romantic, but it is relaxing. It has that sort of friendly/family vibe. I like it. \n\nOh if they do not have what you want on the menu, don't worry. Tell them what you want they can make it for you. The guy said the menu changes everyday. That is just great."

The only thing that keeps this place from being 5 stars in the service.  It's to hit or miss.  Not horrible but needs improvement.  If you're lucky enough to have Chef Marc in the house the night you dine then you're in for a great experience."

Italian cuisine where every dish comes with a personal touch.\n\nService is wonderful and very personable (see Pam, she's great and treats you like you've always been a part of her Italian family).\n\nThey don't lie either --their Antipasto salad is and I quote \"the BEST. ANYWHERE\".  Order a small because their meaning of small is LARGE :) \n\nPasta is exquisite (try the Baked Pasta Fazoletti) and top off your meal with wine from their wonderful selection (try a bottle from the Sinatra Family or their Moscato D'Asti-Risata) and couple it with the ever so delicious dessert-- TIRAMISU and Cannoli ---it'll make you salivate for days and you feel like you've died and gone to food heaven.\n\nThe atmosphere is great--it makes you feel like you've walked into the home of Chef Marc himself to enjoy one of the best Italian meals ever.  They even have the option to take home some of their home made fresh pasta to use for your own cooking pleasure.\n\nOnce you visit you'll be telling everyone what a great restaurant you've just discovered that it'll make you feel like a local :)"

Some of the best Italian and continental  food I have tasted.  Everything made fresh with quality ingredients.  What a difference well made fresh pasta makes. Service was fast and efficient.The cesar salad dressing was spot on.  The Bolognese I had was off the charts.  My wife had short ribs that tasted amazing.  The desserts are homemade by a member of the Chefs family.  The rum cake and the connoli  are the real deal.  Great food at less than strip prices in a casual friendly atmosphere.

Out of all of these the manicotti stands out as being my favorite dish, though I'm thinking you really can't go wrong with any of the food.  But seriously, try the manicotti.  All the ingredients are crafted together to create these tasty dishes, so be sure to enjoy their garlic bread while they prepare your meal.\n\nOn all my visits, with the exception of one, the service has been excellent.  They are attentive and have absolutely no problem going through the menu with you item by item.  On almost every visit, at least one of my friends was unsure of what to get.  The server then goes into interview mode and asks what the person likes and dislikes, leading to a satisfying dish selection.  \n\nAs for the one exception for excellent service: During one of my last visits, I spoke with Chef Marc and told him how I recommend this place to anyone seeking Italian, and complimented him on his staff's attention to customers and quality of food.  That very night, my order was botched.  I had ordred their salmon dinner special for the night, but somehow the waiter thought I ordered the veal parmesan.  My dinner wasn't exactly ruined, but it did dampen my spirits when the rest of my friends were 3/4 of the way through their dinner by the time my food got to me.\n\nNow I have been back since that little incident, and I haven't had experienced any hiccups in service since then.  Parma joins my list of Repeat Eats; I'll dine here anytime I'm invited."

For two people with salads and entrees and splitting a canolli for dessert, it was $72.

We chose to sit at a half booth/table. \n\nThe meal started off with complimentary garlic bread. I could have been fine with just eating the bread! It was hot, soft and some of the best I have ever had. I let the server know that and I was given a loaf to go at the end of the meal!\n\nThey have a lunch and dinner menu. The dinner menu is basically salads, soups and pasta. The dishes range in price and the average pasta price was between $12-$18. There were some items on the menu that cost more. \n\nI was craving a sandwich and asked if they could make on even though it was the dinner menu.  The server checked and said I could order any of the cold sandwiched but not hot. That was perfect because I wanted a cold anyway. I ordered \"The Parma\". It had assorted imported Italian meats and cheeses. They have 2 sizes and I chose the smaller one and that was only $6.50! There was no masking the flavor this sandwich offered. The meat and cheeses had such wonderful taste. I will for sure order this again!\n\nThe inside was very clean and the service was excellent. We would only take a couple drinks of our soda and it was being refilled.\n\nOn Wednesday nights the server said they have pizza and only on that night. I'm going back to try that next!"

I attended last Saturday night. The atmosphere was better during the evening, it was packed with faces that all looked happy, and I over heard a woman talking about Chef Marc's home cooking, I suppose they know each other. Everyone looked as if they had been dining at the same place every week for years! It was very cozy, and in fact while we were dining some of my family and family friends came in to dine! How funny is that?\n\nSo, my major problem with this place is the time it takes to get the food out. Every single course took far too long to get to our table, in my opinion.\n\nPs: I got bread this time! Lots of it! I believe, 3 baskets over the course of our time there? No oil and vinegar though, drat :/.\n\nAppetizer:\nChef Marc came to our table and recommended the Scungilli Salad, and you know what? I do too! It was so, so, so, incredibly refreshing and light. A great way to start!  -$16.00\nWe also ordered the Escargo which, while good, wasn't my favorite way of having it. Oh well. -$9.00\n\nDinner:\nI enjoyed the Linguini and Clams, while my fellow diners enjoyed the Pork Chop and the Bolognese dinner.\n\nBUT before we enjoyed them, we waited. A good amount of time. It seemed a little hectic that night...Chef Marc came and cleared our table and called for his staff to get us new silverware...hmm. Chef, although your wait staff wasn't the best of the bunch that evening, the food was delicious!\n\nAfter dinner we tried the Tirimisu, and the Polenta cake. \n\nBUT before we could try it, we waited. \n\nEven,\n\nlonger.\n\nAND THEN! We stared at our desserts, as they were placed in front of us at a different table...we looked around wondering if that was ours...but waited some more.\n\nand then it came...\nand it was amazing. I loved the polenta cake so much! I'm dreaming about it right now...\n\nSooo, even though the service was...Eh. I AM a fan of the dinner at Pastavino. Would I go again.....aayyee, yes.\nAnd I'm hoping when I go again my review can become a four star or five star one.\n\n\nUntil then Pastavino..."

Trust me, I'm Italian.\n\nUpdate: Went back the next night for freshly tossed, homemade woodfired pizza that they serve on Wednesdays. It was amazing. Fresh and perfectly cooked, tender dough with a crispy crust. And the limoncello cake for dessert. \n\nThe table next to us complained that the food was taking way too long to come out.

Were seated fairly quickly, being we were the only customers, but the person who seated us seemed put out because we didn't have a reservation. One server took our orders (we had 3 serve us, the original was started serving a party and just ignored us) and disappeared, only saw him once until the check, which he delivered after we asked for it.  We got the appitizer of portabello mushrooms with spinich and melted cheese--was VERY GOOD, but delivered by another server. I was thinkiing this was going to be as good as the reviews. This is when the service deteriorated. Our drinks were empty from the time the app came until our entrees, mine a full 3 minutes before the rest of the table was served their entrees. I got the special, veal over brocolini, tasty but not remarkably so. The side of fettucini with sunday sauce was plain, not much taste. My wife had the ravioli, sauce runny, ravioli need to bathe in the boiling water for another minute or two, very very aldente and overall plain. Another in our party got the lasagna, said was plain lasagna nothing special. The overall meal was just plain, not much flavor to the food, except the app. Service was spotty at best. I rated a 3 because of the app and my entree, would have been a 2 for service and the other entrees. Sorry to burst the 5 star bubble for some, but I call them as I see them.

Im a huge fan of their fresh pasta selection as well as their deli choices. Their Italian market is also a key factor with my liking of this place. Its not overly abundant with products, but it seems to have enough to cover your needs if you're in need of traditional italian products.\n\nThe food here is great too. I cant compliment the meat lasagna enough. Delicious! The various other meals I've had have been good too for the price. Service is wonderful, food is great, and prices are fair."

The service, however, depends entirely upon one person (Diane).\n\nWe have been five times. As I say, the first time was amazing... outstanding food, a very inviting atmosphere, and impeccable service from our waitress, Diane.\n\nThe last four times have convinced us never to enter the restaurant unless Diane is there. The \"gentleman\" who seems to manage the place during the day time is so aloof and downright rude that you leave the restaurant upset that you gave anyone there any money.\n\nOn our last dining experience two groups--one on each side of us--both expressed the same sentiments. The staff during the day is horrible, and it affects the entire experience of dining.\n\nIt is a shame, Chef Marc, that you do not have better people representing your restaurant. Let me say this to you and to everyone considering dining here: if Diane is there, you will love this place. If she is not, you will despise it... despite the incredible efforts of the kitchen staff.\n\nI won't be going back for a considerable time, and never during the daytime."

            "review": "Just a note to start before reading this review:  Read RIchard C's review for the male perspective.  Read mine for the bubbly girl perspective.\n\nThis is an Italian gem of a restaurant in Vegas.  It's like finding your perfect other half and wondering where they've been all my life?  I felt the same with Chef Marc's Pastavino Deli.  I'm a Las Vegas native.  Where have you been all my life?!  \n\nWhat brought us here was a recommendation by a friend of its fresh pastas.  I was looking forward to just that.  Chef Marc's dishes lit up my senses from amazing flavors to textures and followed through from beginning to end.  The ambiance is cute, romantic, homely (in a good way) with a touch of hole in the wall feel.  The service was impeccable.  Everyone on staff was super warm and friendly.  The whole experience almost felt like eating at an Italian mama's home kitchen.  Oh yes, do listen to your server's recommendation because our server Jason was on point with the recommendations.\n\nThe breakdown:\n- Complimentary Fresh Garlic Bread - Warm.  Toasty.  Chewy.  Crusty with tasty aroma of garlic and parm on top.\n- Portabello mushroom appetizer (Strongly recommended by Jason) - This was everyone's favorite of the evening.  Warm sauteed strips of portabello mushrooms in a creamy sauce served over a bed of baby spinach.  Don't neglect the leftover sauce.  Mop it up with the wonderful perfectly crusty garlic bread.\n- Antipasto - Yummy cured meets tossed in with a variety of exotic cheeses, olives and greens.  Can't beat it.\n- Caprese Salad Appetizer - The tomatoes were juicy.  The large leaves of basil for fragrant and the fresh mozzarella perfectly chewy and gooey.\n- Chicken Marsala - This was the sleeper hit.  Usually not too impressed by chicken marsala, but this was a bite in heaven.  The slight essence of barely cooked of wine took everyone by surprise in a very good way.\n- Orcchiette with Meatball - the fun ear like pasta wheels were perfectly al dente, chewy and bouncy swimming around in thick red sauce with a huge meatball.  This was a touch on the salty side for me, but the texture of the orchiette itself won handsdown.\n- Agnoletti - This was another big winner!  Tubes of fresh pasta filled with savory beef/lamb mixture with a rich creamy white sauce.  Stick to your ribs good!  Again, don't forget to mop up the sauce with bread.\n- Frutti de Mar - This was our last dish, filled with seafood goodies from clams to calamari to scallops.  The spagetti was of course cooked well and the sauce mopped up to the last drop.\n\nBonuses:  Extra exotic cheeses.  Sliced uber tasty prosciutto on the house!  Having a birthday boy on hand, they gave us some a bit of tart and sweet limoncello to toast!  \n\nConclusion:  It's is a FIVER (star) all the way.  I thought about bringing the rating down one star for being a touch too salty on some items, but the overall experience was too fantastic.  We left bellies full, wallets a little more empty and happily rolled our way home."

The interior put my concerns to rest.  They have both a restaurant seating area as well as a lounge with coffee tables for more casual eating.  The food was very good.  It was easily better than many meals offered at higher profile restaurants on the Strip.  We ordered the Chef's choice which was a five course meal selected by Chef Marc.  The Filet Mignon and the Octopus salad were amazing.  We had three visits from Marc during the meal which was nice.  The only downside to the visit was the quality of the desserts. We were given a cheesecake and a rum cake.  They were just average and not what I expected after such superb entrees.  I would definitely come here again.  As indicated in the other reviews here, service speed is not a priority here.  But then again, this is not fast food.  If I had three hungry young children to feed, I would not come here.  However, if you are looking for a good meal to be eaten at a leisurely pace, this is a great escape from the Strip."

If something is not to your liking, Chef Marc will make it differently without any questions or offer you something else in exchange.

They have a fresh pasta and antipasto bar for you to take home and make it yourself... the pasta cooks just a few minutes and is perfect your favorite glass of wine at home."

Chef Marc actually takes groups of people to Italy on a cooking experience. \n\nAnyhoo back to the food. If you go here, just let Chef Marc make you whatever he wants. He will ask you some dietary questions and then get to work. The food he sends out will make you think you are in Italy. It will actually blow your mind.

The menu has basic Italian apps and entrees plus items like scallops octopus.  Wines by the glass had a pretty good selection, I settled on the Tobin James \"Notorious\" cab.\nThe charred octopus as an app was cooked nicely and, slightly charred on the outside and tender inside.  Sea scallops with polenta cooked to perfection with a decadent sauce.\nOrdered the Chicken Sinatra which was off an old menu and Chef was more the accolades get when we asked if he could make it.  It was delicious, tender chicken pounded thin covered with a cheese and a Marsala-like sauce with mushrooms and peppers.\nAlso had the Gnocchi and they were PERFECTLY cooked, soft tasty and FRESH.  The sauce was a tasty light marinara with little surprise bites of pancetta.\nHad a dessert lisfor locally made Gelato in Salted Caramel which was rich creamy heaven.\nWhat topped dinner off was Chef Marc himself takes the time to walk his dining room floor and speak to his diners.

It's definitely got an interesting vibe to it, being part deli, part lounge and part restaurant.  The waiting/lounge area consists of several easy chairs and couches where you can peruse the menu at a comfortable pace before being seated.  The meal started out with the typical Italian dinner fare of garlic bread with oil.  The bread is made fresh and was absolutely AMAZING!!  Of the four different meals my group ordered, all of them were excellent!  Again, everything's made fresh that day or fresh as of the time your order was placed.  The Chicken Riggies (what I had) was an awesome blend of peppers, chicken, mushrooms and marinara.  The Chicken Parmesan (what my wife had) was fantastic and HUGE.  The chicken breasts where both easily the size of one of my hands!  We came towards the end of the business day and were given a loaf of bread to take home since they will make the bread fresh the next day.  It was awesome, even a couple of days later!  Chef Marc stopped by and chatted for a bit about his visits to Wisconsin where I live.  I even got a picture with him due to his \"celebrity\" status.  This place is head and shoulders above the best chain Italian restaurants!  Altogether, it was an excellent experience, one I'd recommend to anyone going to Vegas who'd like to get off The Strip, and one I'll visit for sure whenever I get back to Vegas!"

They make their pasta in house, what's not to love? \n\nI've tried the mushroom agnoletti, the pasta fagioli (make sure to get a large, it isthat good), buccatini and papardelle bolognese. The papardelle is the bomb! It is on my top ten list of favorite dished in this city. Marc's food is as authentic as it gets in this city, he understands the mediterranean concept of simplicity. In Italy, the food is very simple, five ingredients max in a dish. If you use the best quality ingredients, you don't need anything else.\n\nThe only reason I give it four stars, and really it is 4.7 is becaue of the service. I never encounter great service. And I know for a fact that they treat others better because I've seen it. They prefer an older, more sophisticated clientele. I don't know if Summerlin housewives really qualify, but whatever. \n\nWhen you visit, you should definitely check out thei rdeli counter for some formaggio, charcuterie and fresh pasta to take home. They also sell cans of San Marzano tomatoes, so you can mke everything fresh at home."

I had a salad that Chef Marc personally recommended with Arugula, Sweet Corn, and Crab Meat.  It was incredible!  Then he made me a special Chicken Parmesan with a creamy white sauce and squid ink pasta.  It was 5 star!\n\nThe other two diners with me had similar dinning experiences and both (like me) have vowed to return to Parma.  One being a local that now lives only 2 miles away will be there quite often.  The other visits Vegas 5 to 6 times a year so she will be a regular as well.\n\nChef Marc was very personable and all of the staff did a great job of making us feel as if we were in a fine dining establishment and not a family style restaurant.  The only issue we had was that it was over 111 degrees outside at 7:00 PM,  and the staff did not offer us anything to drink while we waited for a table.  This was eventually rectified by Chef Marc, but it should be something that they automatically offer patrons that are waiting in the future."

We had a bowl of  pasta fagioli soup that wasn't even warm, 8 bucks give me a break, the server nuked it  so it was all dryed up around the edges and  not evenly warmed  up, for that money it should have been right.  This place is legend in it's own mind.  The sandwich was just o.k.  The worst part about it is when I ordered 35.00 worth of cheeses and deli meats.  The prosciutto was sliced very thin I tested it before he continued to slice it ,  when I got home he had  piled it so it couldn't be seperated.  He knew nothing about slicing deli meats.  18.00 a lb.  The provolone was not sliced at all,  just a hunk. 15.00 a lb.  I have had better sliced meats at Smiths.  The one good thing about this place is the bread, it comes from Bunn Bakery.  They had nothing to do with it.  I\"m sorry the people that are giving this place 4 and 5 stars have never had wonderful Italian food.  This experience was like getting ripped off at the strip.  I will never return to the place."

            "review": "I really, really wanted to like this place.  Unfortunately, my experience wasn't terrific, although the food was very good.  My experience was less than stellar for a few reasons. \n\nI was excited for awesome food and service I had read about in the reviews.  The latter fell short.  I feel obligated to mention the positive points before the negative points.  \n\nPros:  \n-Our water glasses were kept full through out the meal.  I think both of us drank about five glasses each, so I was impressed.\n-The starter bread is delicious.  It's crunchy, it's chewy, it's toasty.  The crust  has olive oil along with garlic and Parmesan on the surface.\n-The beet salad, although very small for the price was fresh and tasty.\n-Both of our entrees, the \"Chicken Riggies\" and the \"Parpadelle Bolognese,\" were delish.\n\nAmber asked us if we had any questions about the menu.  I asked if the salads were big enough to split for two people.  She answered with an immediate \"Yes.\"  So, we ordered the roasted beet salad, listed at $12.00 on the menu.  When she brought it out I thought, \"Oh, that's a tiny portion for two people,\" but I wasn't going to mention it.  Amber then says, \"I should have mentioned this is one of our smaller salads.\"  \"Ummmm......Yeah you should have told us that, we may have not ordered it,\" I thought to myself.  She then goes on to say,  \"If you want more just let me know and I'll bring out some more.\"  Now, I know she didn't say the words \"ON THE HOUSE,\" but she definitely gave me that impression.  After we finished the first plate she said, \"I'll bring out another one.\"  I reacted with a surprised \"Wow, thanks!\"  I mean I was really impressed.  I thought, \"This server is really nice!\"  \n\nWe finished the salad and she offered to bring another bread basket with the main entrees.  Our food arrives and it's really good. At this point I was writing a glowing review in my mind and Amber had at least a $20 tip going her way. \n\nWe were full pretty quick, so she noticed and boxed up our food.  She offered coffee, which we declined.  We ordered one cannoli to share.  Finally the bill arrives and it's not a little bit off, it's a lot off...I'll list the reasons:\n\n-The menu lists the \"Chicken Riggies\" at $18.00.  It shows up as $22.00 on the bill.\n-The menu lists the cannoli at $3.75.  It shows up as $4.00 on the bill.  I know, I know, a lousy quarter, but it's the PRINCIPLE.\n-The menu lists the beet salad at $12.00.  It shows up on the bill at $14.00.  I should mention I didn't notice this until I got home and looked at the menu listed on their website, which reminded me.  So they got away with that discrepancy.  PLUS, I was charged for two of these bad boys.  Who pays $28 for beet salad???  It was getting ridiculous at this point.  She absolutely gave the impression that second salad would be free, because she failed to mention that is was a small salad to share.\n\nOf course my girlfriend spoke to Amber about the bill situation.  I went to the bathroom, so I didn't hear the conversation, but she changed it to $7.00 for the second salad, instead of $14.00, which in reality should have actually been $6.00 instead $12.00.  That is my fault because I didn't realize that discrepancy until we got home. \n\nThe whole bill situation left a bad taste in my mouth.  I was looking forward to going back for pizza night, but I don't think that is going to happen.\n\nMoral of the story:  KEEP A COPY OF THE MENU.  Make sure you refer back to the menu when looking over the bill if you eat here."

My family wanted Italian food and it seemed like there wasn't much on the strip that was highly rated that had entrees less than $30, so we came here.  We ended up coming a little before 5 so we had to order off the lunch menu (pasta and sandwiches).  I think they have more in the way of entrees available for dinner.  My husband had spaghetti and meatball, my father had a meatball sub and my mom & I split a chicken parmesan sandwich and the spinach and cheese manicotti.  Everybody was really pleased with their food.  The manicotti was especially amazing.  The pink basil sauce it came in was to die for.  We requested some garlic bread before the meal and it ended up being free.  The bread was amazing, very buttery and parmesan-y.  The portions were normal size, not monstrous American portions, so although we left full we did not have any leftovers.  The prices are a little higher than you might expect given the strip mall location and casual ambiance, but the food is well worth it and still a total deal compared to the strip.  Service was excellent as well.  I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a delicious, affordable meal in Vegas."

Seriously, don't believe them.  \n\nI love to cook and I rarely go out, because I hate to waste money on bad restaurants.  This one truly was a miserable experience and a waste of good money. \nIt is also not cheap.  \n\nIf you want Italian.......go to Due Forni is so much better!\n\nI have lived in Las Vegas for 14 years and I have NEVER been so disappointed in a restaurant.  \n\nThe experience was so bad I truly think I deserve a refund.  I was so looking forward to visiting this restaurant for a long time....and wow....what I let down.  Truly!!\n\nSERVICE:  Zero Points.  We arrived were told we could sit where we wanted.  The host did not introduce himself.  He brought us tap water and some bread.  He also delivered the menus.  He came back and asked us if we knew what we wanted to order.  We said 'yes\" and he picked up the menus and left, without taking our order. \n\nThen came our waitress, who took our order with menus.  She was friendly but we only saw her for the order and at the end for the check. \nI had to call across the room three times to get her attention to take the veal away, because we couldn't eat it.  She removed the item from our bill. \nI didn't want to complain about all the food and service, because I had invited two people to dinner.  I was horrified, with the entire dinner. \n\nWhile all this was happening the owner was eating dinner with his back to the restaurant. \n\nThe entire staff didn't seem professional.....like the Island of Misfit toys....table wasn't bused timely, water wasn't kept filled, it was awful.  Could not wait to leave. \n\nWe went next door to Trader Joes and bought groceries and went home and made dinner. \n\nFOOD:  Zero points.  Each pasta was between 19-22 dollars.  \n\n The veal ravioli was fatty and bland.  No sauce added.  The presentation was nonexistent.  The green beans were flash cooked and tasted raw. \n\n The beet salad, was not finely sliced ....rather ice cold chunks out of the fridge.  \n\n  The \"wild mushroom\" pasta was not fresh.  Rather the cook used dried mushrooms which were not properly rehydrate.  They were awful.  The papadella noodles were not cooked through and crunchy.  \n\nThe only plate that was edible was the sausage ravioli.  Nothing special. \n\nCan I also mention that they served all the plates with no presentation.  The Parmesan cheese was in a shaker.  Most fine Italian restaurants serve their pastas with freshly shaven Parmesan.  Not here."

I came this time with high expectations because I have read and heard so much about the wait staff and the food.  There was nothing welcoming about the staff.  Our server did not seem knowledgeable about the menu nor was she particularly prompt in taking our orders in a restaurant that was not busy.  I had a chopped salad which was a good size but unremarkable in its flavor.  The meatball I ordered as a side was a bit chewy but the sauce was quite good.  I may give it one more try and have a pasta dish. I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it but I much prefer Mezzo (which I believe was once Chef Marc's place) to Parma."

Green flecks that tasted like faint Pesto were also on the plate.  This concoction was very tasty, including the best Buffalo Mozzarella I have experienced to date.  Chef Marc imparted that this cheese was derived from water buffalo cow inhabiting the environs of Naples.\n\nSECOND COURSE: For a second course, we were presented with two very large platters of New York Style Hot Antipasto for every 3 diners, so that, try as we might, some of this delectable food was left behind.  We got to sample Eggplant rolled up like a burrito or Chinese Eggroll but not deep-fried; lovely Clams filled with Oregano, Parsley, and Bread Crumbs to become Clam Oreganata; naked Calamari; Mussels filled with Artichoke Hearts; and some Green Peppers and cut mushrooms spread throughout the hot platters like accent marks unifying all elements of this sumptuous and quite filling appetizer.  Would that Western Style Antipasto plates were this tasty and refined!\n\nAlso complementing this dish was excellent cheese-topped and crusty bread and butter.  But, alas, Chef Marc directed his servers to remove the bread soon after the repast began, lest we fill up too much on it.\n\nTHIRD COURSE: For the next course, we were treated to a very hot and nuanced Spinach & Walnut Risotto with flakes of Mascarpone Cheese circling 'round the rim of the bowl.  This rich offering was quite flavorful without any single component overpowering the others.\n\nFOURTH COURSE: As a main course, set down before us was a bowl of rich, delicious, and fork-tender Slow-braised Neapolitan Veal Cheek, along with German-style Red Cabbage made with Brown Sugar and Red Wine Vinegar, and subtly flavored Polenta.  The star of this assemblage was the Veal Cheek, which tasted much like well-prepared Osso Buco.  And, Chef Marc confirmed that this entree did actually come from the cheeks of young calves.  \n\nFIFTH COURSE:  As a fifth and final course, we were treated to a dessert plate with slices of Green Apple, honey in a small pouring bowl, Blueberries, and somewhat springy planks of solid Parmesan Cheese that Chef Marc referred to as \"diving boards.\"  These elements were to be assembled and joined together according to our personal whims.  I found that dabs of honey acted like glue when Blueberries were pressed into them on top of a plank of cheese, and the conglomeration was further sweetened by adding a honey-soaked slice of apple into the mouth when chewing.  This sweet and cheesy dish was my least favorite course, but I appreciated the simplicity and inventiveness of the dish.  Everything else I thought was both creative and a foodie's delight. \n\nThroughout the meal, Chef Marc or one of his assistants provided a running commentary of each course just before it was served, and patiently answered all diners' questions.  This added to the enjoyment of the experience, although in previous MANGIA! rounds Chef Marc did all the narration himself, which I liked better.\n\nMost of our group of about 17 diners experienced the Chef's Table (some with wine pairings), but a few, like Diane, ordered ala carte.  And, she was quite pleased with the two quite large and lean scallops of Veal Parmesan Alfredo and Penne Alfredo with which she was presented.  Half of the order served as a fine lunch the next day.\n\nNelson and Sylvia Q. presented all diners with a vial of sand from different beaches in Hawaii, and did another great job in organizing this event.  Props to them for hosting, and to Chef Marc and his staff for preparing and serving, yet another outstanding MANGIA! dining extravaganza!"

My BF's kind of sammie: heavy on the meats, bold on flavor. Ask for it warmed in the oven.\nTHE CAMPANIA (Fresh\u200b mozzarella, fire roasted peppers, pesto, basil, sliced tomatoes, balsamic dressing), definitely my kind of sandwich: pesto and tomato and mozz balls, that's like the trifecta of Italian perfection, and I'm so glad I ordered it. \nNEW YORK: Classic meatball sando with tons of mozz. Incredible balls. Sandwich is $11 and easily feeds two, it's my go-to. Add on the pasta fagioli soup (hearty and fresh) and the chopped salad ($8 for a huge portion) and you've gone a great lunch date under $30.\n\nThe (great quality!) bread used for the sandwiches (different for each) and the overabundance of ingredients makes for large sandwiches that can be difficult to eat in public without making a mess- as in, I practically have to unhinge my jaw-  a little awkward."

First time I got take out and did the Parma cold sandwich without cheese.   The guy helping me seemed a little preoccupied during the ordering process, and particularly when I was trying to get my iced tea I'd ordered.   A few minutes later I finally realized why he seemed to be brushing me aside (that's a strong way to put it, he was still friendly).   Nic Cage and his wife and son (presumably) were dining at one of the tables nearby.   Now there was a large part of me that wanted to be the annoying fan and run over and ask for him to do a scene of Bad Lieutenant from Port of Call (youtube this immediately if you're unaware).   Since his wife and kid were with him, I figured that might not be the best idea, so I settled for a scene from the Wicker Man instead.   Okay so I really just sat and did nothing and waited for my food.   When I ate it later at my office, I was greatly impressed.  A plethora of olives, pepperocinis and various italian meats.  I marked it as reason #41 why I will never go to a Subway by choice again and awaited my next opportunity to strike.\n\nWell that came yesterday, when I brought a co-worker with me for a sit down lunch.   I was dead set to try a pasta so I could have a more well rounded Yelp Review (I do it all for you guys).   Unfortunately while looking through the menu I couldn't shake the pics of the italian beef sandwich I'd seen in the pics section on this site.  I asked our extremely friendly and efficient waitress which I should get, the italian beef or the rigatoni and she said she hadn't had the rigatoni but the italian beef is amazing.   I mean she didn't even upsell me the extra $1.75 for the pasta.   Sorry Yelp, but the well rounded review will have to wait.  \n\nTo go all 17 year old snapchatter on you:   OMG at this sandwich!!! :) :) :)     Just unbelievably stuffed full of juicy beef, pepperocini and with a healthy serving of lusciously melted cheese.   Then with a big bowl of au jus to dip it in.   I'm used to au jus from lesser quality restaurants being very thin and not extremely flavorful.   Not here.   Thick with beef flavor, because what you really need when shoving your mouth full of 2 pounds of beef on a sandwich is more beef flavor.    And you know what?  That's not all.  I'm pretty sure the bread was garlic bread.   In fact, I'm sure of it because the rest of the day my mouth couldn't shake that garlic flavor and flowers wilted when I breathed on them.    A+\n\nRefills on the iced tea came at a fast pace, and I even inconvenienced our poor waitress by asking for one to go, as well as by signing the wrong receipt on a 50/50 split check because I'm a massive idiot.  She took it all in stride.\n\nI promise, next time I'll try the pasta (and get a creepshot of Nic Cage)"

The eggplant was amazing and is on the menu. The braised pork was the special and was superb!  His polenta is so creamy and delicious!\n\nThe 2nd time we went there, we did the Chef's special paired with wines to celebrate our first night of our honeymoon across the country.  It was so worth the cab fare!  We had a Pizza Bianco, Octopus and Sweet Sausage, Short Rib Ravioli in a Brown Butter & Sage Sauce, Iowa Pork Lion with leeks and white wine, and veal cheeks with red cabbage.  For dessert we had tiramisu and strawberry shortcake.  \n\nThe meal took about 2 hours and was well worth it.  We loved chatting with Chef Marc and his staff.  \n\nThe quality and price of the food is so much better than anything I have ever had on the strip.   We dream about going back and will definiately always stop by when we are in town!"

However, a bit of an identity crisis as they certainly charge a premium: $18 for a plate of Parpadelle pasta for eating essentially inside a convenience store. Also their food was consistently on the salty side."

            "review": "I'm generally not a carb-a-holic, but my carb loading binge for the Rock n Roll half marathon  led me here.  This is a similar concept to Roma's deli, but with a more personal touch.  They have a variety of seating options.  In the center there are lounge style couches and coffee tables, bistro/cafe area seating, and a more formal dining room.  We liked the bistro area since it seemed more lively and the noise masked the crying of my baby nephew.  Also the the UW vs UCLA game was playing...it was the fiances bday as well so it was only fair to let him watch football while eating :) As soon as we were seated the servers brought water and bread, and then Chef Marc comes to the table and goes over the menu specials and even goes into an explanation of their prep.  Very nice touch, truly makes every diner feel like they are a VIP.  The servers were always attentive and the water glass was never went empty.\n\nNow onto the food.  We ordered the portobello mushroom appetizer and the charred octopus.  The portobello mushroom appetizer was deceiving, while not the prettiest plating....the flavor combo was UH..MAZING!! My sister in law didn't realize they were mushrooms, she thought there was meat in the dish.  The mushrooms are sliced thin in a cheesy gorgonzola alfredo sauce topped with crisp organic spinach.  It was so good we cleaned the plate off.  The charred octopus was cooked to perfection with an granny apple/celery/chickpea slaw.  Even the bread that is complimentary is delicious with a Parmesan garlic topping.  On to the entrees, I ordered the chicken marsala but also tried the ahi bolognese.  The marsala sauce is probably the best I've ever had with marsala wine making almost a gravy that was great for dipping bread.  The ahi bolognese was the special for the night and they took the sushi grade ahi, ground it up and cooked it lightly and added it to thin spaghetti.  Pure genius! Since there was a birthday in the party, I got to sample the fiances free cannoli and it had a great pastry shell with delicious filling and was topped with fruit and chocolate chips.  Who can pass up a good cannoli?\n\nThings I will definitely need to come back for: escargot, purchase their fresh pasta, checkout their small selection of Italian groceries, and of course check out their deli meats!"

            "review": "Well, my review is based on a visit I had to Parma about a month ago, it was my first time, based on the great yelp reviews and close proximity to my home. The Italian beef sandwich was great, the au jous phenomenal! The combination of the bread, cheese and meat was great -... But, I'll never visit them again based on service.   Let me elaborate. \n\nI was checking the menu and the young lady at the counter asked if I knew what I wanted.. I told her it's my first time and I'm checking the sandwiches - she turned around and went back to doing whatever she was doing (it was about 2:30 in the afternoon - no line, a couple of folks waiting for their order, a large party was finished and folks were milling around, talking etc.).   I decide on the large Italian beef and wait a few minutes and finally had to say 'excuse me, I'm ready to order'.  I place my order,pay and sit down on a couch.  I wait the 10 or so minutes and it looks like my order is ready.  A different gal asks the girl who took my order 'who is this for'?  The girls responds,' some Indian looking guy' . \n\nFor goodness sakes people I'm sitting right in front of you! The gal with my food was kind enough to look at me and gave me a look of apology and a thank you. Food was good but service was horrible - no worries, I'll just eat elsewhere.  For a place with such a reputation, I figured they would treat paying customers with a bit more respect."

            "review": "This quirky gem of a deli / restaurant was on our food radar thanks to Yelp reviewers.  Food superb, service stellar, ambiance....well, interesting.  \n\nAs is the owner, Chef Marc, who on our first visit (for takeout) was not in the kitchen but  holding court in \"sofa lounge\" section of the space, enjoying beverages  with a couple of lovely young ladies who seemed entertained by his every word.  On our second visit (for dinner) the next day, we were disappointed to learn the Chef was not in the house as we had called ahead of making our reservations specifically for a night Chef Marc was scheduled in the kitchen as we had heard about his personal talents. But he was indisposed at home we were told as we were seated and asked if he was cooking.  Our disappointment faded quickly as we found dinner did not suffer without him present; the food was delectable and the service top notch.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  This is on our \"go back\" list when we're in Las Vegas. Were it in our hometown, we'd be regulars. Seemed like mostly locals on  both nights we visited.  Sometime we'd love to come back with a group and reserve the Chef's table for off the menu Italian food experience. \n\nNW VEGAS  OFF STRIP LOCATION: About fifteen minutes drive off the LV strip in the unlikely location of a mall that is also home to KMart and Trader Joe's..  Cost of round trip cab fare added to the dinner tab may make this destination outside the bounds for those staying on the strip without their own transportation.  But if you have a car go to Parma!\n\nFABULOUS FOOD: Full service restaurant serving lunch and dinner and take out Italian deli combined here.( Dinner service starts at 5p.)   We enjoyed...\n\n...antipasto for two. Thanks to others who recommended this and encouraged us to order it.  A generous mix of salumi along with cheeses and olives on a bed of perfectly dressed  fresh salad greens, it may be the best of the kind we have ever eaten.\n\n...spaghetti carbonara.  One of our favorite pastas but an act of faith to order in a restaurant as it requires the pasta and eggs to be combined just right to get a silky sauce and not raw egg.  This was perfect, wonderfully flavored with pancetta  and just the right amount of cracked black pepper and cheese  enhanced by the addition of peas, it arrived at our table piping hot.  \n\n...egglplant parmesan.  An absolutely delicious rendition of a classic, this one was not breaded, it was perfectly seasoned, cooked to the right consistency and sweetness with good red sauce and a generous amount of melted mozzarella.  \n\nWe finished by sharing a slice of the yummy rum cake and very good coffee.  \n\n(Side note...take out cannoli on another day, filled as we waited on them as good cannoli should be, were outstanding!)\n\nGOOD WINE:  The wine list was surprisingly broad for such a small place and thoughtfully composed.  We ended up ordering by the glass for four glasses total in combo of prosecco to start followed by Nero d'Avola and Primitivo.\n\nGREAT VALUE:  Total bill for this meal was about $80.   It could easily have fed three people and we had leftovers to bring back with us to the LV condo where we were staying. \n\nSTELLAR SERVICE:  We had the good fortune to have Christian be our server.  We noted he also was attending to the customers who arrived for take out (and the take out business was brisk) and in general seemed to keep things humming with the kitchen and other wait staff.  Christian made all customers feel most welcome, and he made service seem effortless.  As with the table next to us, a couple of regulars who had special requests that we might most charitably say were difficult, and Christian made it seem simple.  If you are a restaurant owner, an employee like this is worth his weight in gold.  \n\nQUIRKY AMBIANCE:  Great aromas as you enter.  Wonderful \"fit\" selection of Italian music or popular tunes by Italian American recording artists on the sound system.  (Frankie, Dino, Como...)  \n\nEclectic  \"vibe\" with dining tables around the perimeter and an odd arrangement of coffee tables and sofas in the middle of the room.  We guess Chef Marc fancies this a lounge.  But this furniture provided a sense of obstacle course to get to the deli / take out counter.   For our two bits, it would be best to do a little space planning and  have a clear and inviting path for all customers to get to the incredible deli.\n\nACCESSIBILITY ISSUES:  Tight spacing of furniture would make wheelchair access difficult, it seems to me.  Also, while the loo was accessible in design, it seems it would be impossible for a wheelchair user to get through the aisles to get there.  Easy barriers for the owner to remove with furniture rearrangement."

We searched Yelp and this restaurant had the best rating in the area so we decided to check it out (thanks fellow Yelpers!). Plus the name sounded a tad familiar...Food Network?\n\nI am so glad we dined here. All of the pastas are made from scratch -- from penne, rigatoni, spaghetti, elbow, linguini and more. I went with the rigatoni & pink sauce and added a grilled chicken breast ($12). My take? The sauce tantalized my taste buds, the rigatoni was amazing and perfectly al dente. I only wish the portion size was bigger because I polished it off quickly. The chicken was a touch overcooked and they took it back without me even saying a peep. My boyfriend opted for the chicken parm sandwich (large - $12.95). His take on the sandwich? Those were no little, over breaded chicken fingers slapped on a hoagie. Oh no, this was a hand pounded, full chicken breast, topped with mozzarella cheese & marinara sauce all sandwiched between two down right delicious pieces of garlic bread. He wouldn't stop raving about it. The whole menu is a smorgasbord of Italian delights. We want to go back and try dinner service!\n\nWhen we mentioned to our server that we had never been there before, he brought us out another complimentary (dinner sized) dish just for us to try! We were blown away. The pappardelle noodles in this 3rd dish were SOO good...they were light and perfectly cooked. I would definitely order that the next time we dine in. We were so impressed with the customer service of our server, Mike. This small gesture will make us repeat customers. Bravo! Mike also informed us that if we texted \"Parma\" to 90210 we would receive two free cannoli's. Man, were they tasty! Love those little chocolate chips :) We could barely walk out by the end of lunch. lol.\n\nThe restaurant also has a full deli service counter where you can take home fresh prosciutto or a pound of mozzarella. They have take-out as well so you can come pick up a sandwich on the fly. They also have a mini store in the front where they sell noodles, sauces, peppers and more.\n\nLove, love, love!!!"

I was really in the mood for some fresh pasta and with their awesome reviews, we figured it had to be good. We were not disappointed! We called ahead to make a reservation and when we got there they didn't have a table, but they seated us on a couch in their lounge. The host was extremely friendly and talked to us about the menu while we waited. They also brought out bread and water, which was incredibly thoughtful.We were seated at a table a few minutes after hanging out in the lounge. \n\nThe complimentary bread is delicious and topped with fresh parmesan cheese. They have olive oil and balsamic on the table if you would like to create a dip, which of course we did. We decided to start with the house salad and were incredibly happy that we did. It has a light oil dressing, apple strips, nuts, and a mound of fresh ricotta. The ricotta is so silky smooth and rich. Everything worked well together and the fresh pepper they added to the top really made the flavors sing. I moved on to the sausage and spinach ravioli with Sunday sauce. They were stunning! I received the perfect size portion, about 6, and cleaned my plate with a little help from my husband. The sausage flavor was prominent, but you could still taste the spinach, cheese, and incredible sauce. My husband had the pappardelle bolognese and it did not disappoint. The meat sauce was delicious and there were carrots and peas mixed in as well. The pasta was delicate but cooked to a perfect al dente so it didn't fall apart. \n\nNot only was the food amazing, but the service was great too. We really felt like we were part of the family. I also love that they have a deli counter with all sorts of Italian delights. In addition, they sell their fresh pastas and sauces so you can make a delicious dinner very easily at home. A restaurant serving this caliper of food could easily be stuffy and formal, but the lounge and deli counter really bring it back down to earth. I also love that they change their menu almost nightly, it makes it easy to try all sorts of new dishes. We will definitely be back!"

            "review": "Ate here with 2 friends after reading the stellar reviews.  Overall, the food was very good, but the service was a little slow and it is a little pricey for what you get.  Basically, if you are fairly hungry you pretty much have to get an appetizer plus dinner because the entree sizes are kind of small.  I had the Bocatini, which is kind of a thick noodle, like a chow mein noodle, with like a pot roast type meat.  It was EXCELLENT.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and kind of chewy..it was awesome.  I also had a shrimp and white bean appetizer which was very good.  The house bread they gave us was tasty as well.  Everyone else enjoyed their food as well.  I also had the chocolate cake for dessert which was quite tasty, as it had a little layer of crunchy in it to go with the smooth cake.\n\nNow, the food was excellent and we would definitely go back, but I can't give it 5 stars.  It took a fair amount of time for anyone to bring us menus, the food took quite a while to come out and overall the service was not bad, just really slow.  Also, $20 for a pretty small bowl of pasta is a little steep if you ask me.  As I said, the entrees are pretty small...I mean, without an appetizer you would definitely be hungry after just the pasta.  My little bowl of white beans and shrimp was $14, the pasta was $20 and the slice of cake was $7.  Not extreme by any means, but combined with the slow service and the relatively small portions, I take 1 star.  However, I would definitely return and would recommend it."

It's the kind that is so moist, you can smunch it and it doesn't crumble.  The olive oil is a cut above. For starters we had the caprese salad, prosciutto crudo and artichokes.  It was all so tasty.  The mozzarella was the real deal. \n\nNext we all had a different homemade pasta with wonderful sauces.  Three of us had the pomodoro sauce which was perfect and fresh.  One had the pomodoro and meatballs which again was perfect.  Finally we topped it off with an espresso which was done in the manner you would find in Italy.

I thought the chef had finally figured out that if you offer stingy portions, even if the food is good, that people catch on.  We had gone to the old Marc's only one time many years ago and  had a similar experience to what we had tonight.  Large glass, little wine, large plates, tiny portions.  My husband and I are always on the lookout for good Italian restaurants and a few friends had recommended that we go to Parma.  Neighborhood restaurants come and go very quickly in Las Vegas and many places that we had frequented had closed due to either the economy or poor management.  We were very excited to find that Parma was just what we were looking for; a good neighborhood feel, great service, good food and generous portions at a reasonable price.  It was becoming more and more popular and the restaurant had expanded their space and added 10-12 more tables.  Yay for them and us!  A few weeks back, when there on a Saturday night, we noticed things had changed....$3 for additional bread, a charge for sharing, even a salad and  smaller portions of wine but the food was the same.  Tonight though?  I ordered the agnolotti stuffed with various meats and served with a sage butter sauce.  Sounded great.  The place was crowded and we felt as if we were getting the bum's rush since we hadn't even finished our salads before our entrees came.  The chef accompanied our server to the table, leaned over and said (obviously for our benefit) \"i think it was good to increase the portion size to 15...it's a lot more generous.\", in reference to my agnolotti.  Really?  You couldn't have said that in the back?   It appeared to be so staged!  I guess I was supposed to feel VERY LUCKY to be paying only $19 for 15 agnolotti.  By my calculations, that's about $1.25 per piece. I, too, make my own pasta...it's not that big of a deal!  To add insult to injury, both my husband's cavetelli and my dinner were delivered in those  ginormous bowls  that only hold about 1 1/2 cups of food. I'm still hungry! His portion was small as well.  Our server must have picked up on my irritation and before I had a chance to voice my displeasure over being made to feel that I had the privilege of being stiffed, he sent another server over to close out our bill.  Word to Chef Marc....keep it up and this restaurant will close, too."

Dinner is another review(2 starred review). \n\nWe have been to Parma before during dinner time and the food is good albeit kind of expensive for the portion size. When I saw that they had a truncated but less expensive lunch menu,  I was sold. \n\nSo we ordered a small side salad ($3),  fazoletti ($12), and spaghetti with meatballs(actually it is one big meatball,  $12)\n\nBread service is not at all like dinner time.  The French bread is cold,  chewy and a far cry from the crisp, warm garlic bread they have at dinner. Served with butter,  we had to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar. \n\nThe side salad was a little sad and meager. (One slice of tomato with 6 chickpeas a few olives and shaved onions with 7 pieces of red leaf lettuce.) The flavors were not well integrated. \n\nFazoletti was a huge disappointment (this was supposed to be a baked pasta dish with Sunday meat sauce,  ricotta topped with mozzarella). The dish came onto the table looking like more of like a standard pasta dish with no golden brown cheese topping from baking. Never had a Sunday sauce taste so bland without a hint of aromatics or acidity to lighten the dish. To add insult to injury,  the meat chunks mixed in with the sauce were salty. The paparadelle itself was nothing to write home about and I felt a tad overcooked. \n\nTheir best dish was the spaghetti and meatball but even that was far from perfect.  The meatball was pretty firm and overly salty. The marinara sauce was much better than their Sunday sauce but still lacked the sufficient aromatics to make it spectacular. The spaghetti at least was perfectly al dente.\n\nIn terms of the ratio of sauce/gravy (whatever  you want to call it) to pasta, the pasta was overly dressed for my tastes in both the dishes. \n\nService was prompt and efficient. \n\nIt is hard to believe this is the same restaurant we came to before. I am not sure if this was an off day or what but after looking at other reviews for lunch,  ours is not an isolated incident. Our previous experiences here would have ranked this place about a 3.5 starred joint with a bump up to 4 stars if only the prices were a bit more reasonable.  But given the lunch items,  this place scores a 2 starred review."

The place had a pleasant feel and the Italian opera in the background was just right. Again, even though the place was packed and several people were waiting for takeout, service was good and we were able to hear about the amazing menu from Chef Marc himself. The bread w/ oil and vinegar was fresh and good. The staff was all very friendly and when our food came we were all in heaven. Everything was hot and beautiful and tasted incredible. I had the Sweet Potato Gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce and loved it!  Thank you so much Chef Marc and staff for helping us to feel welcome and special. Thank you for being accommodating to a large party with two little babies. We will be coming back!!"

The Italian Beef sandwich is what keeps me coming back but each time I order an additional item on the menu. I recently had the meatballs and sausage in Sunday sauce and was not as impressed with the flavors. It was a bit bland to me and it just made me focus again on the Italian Beef sandwich.\n\nI like the couch seating the have in the middle of the restaurant. It may seem odd at first but it's a nice option for people that want a more relaxed dining experience. Service is spotty. One female server was awesome three visits ago. More recent visits left me wanting more attention to my water glass but the service was friendly."

It's got a spring that I can't get enough of!\nChef Marc's came up and we jumped for it, especially with their nightly menu and little side meat, olive, and Italian market!\n\nx Our starter breads were warm and soft. :) LOVE.\n\nx Parpadelle Bolongnese -- thick yet sliced thin. :) I loved the sauce..there was so much leftover that it was just perfect with the lovely warm starter breads. The only problem I had with this was that the sauce didn't taste astounding .. it sort of meshed with the parpadelle and didn't leave a distinct flavor. Maybe because there was too much sauce? \n\nx House Salad -- a nice little salad with fruit. Simple. \n\nx Gnnochi with meatballs -- We liked it but it wasn't as good as some of the places we had gnnochi in CA. The gnnochi was more on the mushy/chewy side and didn't have that nice firmness to it. \n\nThe ambiance is suuuper casual .. we dined on couches!! :) The service is excellent. You definitely leave with a warm feeling in your tummy and heart!"

For our meal we ordered the Chicken Marsala and we couldn't even cut it with a butter knife.  The server apologized and said the chef was training a new employee.  Not sure why you would use your customer as the Guinea Pig.  She took it back and we ordered a hot ham and cheese.  The sandwich came out cold and had ingredients on it that were not listed on the menu.  The server was nice and that is the only good experience we had.  I would not recommend this restaurant."

            "review": "I am by no means a \"fine dining\" type of person. I don't appreciate small plates of food that cost about 30 dollars a plate and you don't leave full. Chef Marc's is definitely not one of those places where you leave hungry, BUT the quality of the food is top notch as well as the service. I left Chef Marc's full, but maybe we should start back at the beginning. \n\nIt was a busy Saturday night and they had large parties in so they were unable to accommodate us until 8pm, which was fine since we had a late lunch. Walking inside you realize that its a small, but cozy place. There's an area with couches that you can hang out with your friends and drink wine and eat good food. \n\nWe were seated right away and Chef Marc came up and introduced himself. He told us about the menu and the specials of the evening. The one that caught my attention was the \"boooofalo mozzarella\", mussels and the uni fettuccine. They were out of uni so that was a no go. \n\nWe decided to start with the Buffalo Mozzarella. It was delicious! The mozzarella was unlike any other mozzarella (creamy as Chef Marc had described it). The tomatoes were paired perfectly with the cheese. I'm not a tomato person usually, but these tomatoes were pretty dang awesome. The table next to us had ordered the Antipasto salad, so that sold me too. It was a huge heaping portion of awesomeness. I was already a bit stuffed after all that, but I couldn't resist trying the Veal Loin Strip and the Papperdelle Bolognese. The veal caught my eye, but I should remember from now on that I've never had veal that blew me out of this world. The veal was good and paired with kale, but it definitely was not my favorite. I guess not everything can be my favorite. The Papperdelle Bolognese was my favorite though. YUMMY freshly made pasta with yummy meaty tuscan style sauce. I could eat those noodles over and over again. Yum! Chef Marc came by after our meal and asked us how everything was. Our server (sorry he was overpowered by Chef Marc) was very attentive also. \n\nWith a meal like this we had to have dessert.....one cannoli please. My fianc\u00e9 had asked about the rum cake and the server was kind enough to give us a complimentary slice. Cannoli filling was delicious! The shell they don't make in house, I thought it was still delicious, but the fianc\u00e9 thought it should be a tad bit crispier. Rum cake, maybe not my cup of tea but it was still good. \n\nDo I love Chef Marcs? Yes....service was awesome, food was great and I left full. For everything that we ordered plus tip, it was a 100 dollars well spent.  I can't wait to be back and ready to try other things. BTW they can \"course\" out the pasta and \"protein\" dish if you decide to go the way we did, so that each person can have their own individual plate."

Spicy, but good.\nA new creation \"Barbershop Chicken\" is awesome comfort food!  Also spicy with loads of peppers, chunks of spicy sausage and of course, organic chicken.

I was running in a race the next morning, and wanted some pasta.  We checked Yelp and found Chaf Marc's.  We got there just before closing and received great service.  The food was wonderful and our server was very attentive, eventhough they were about to close.  We knew we would be back.\n\nWe went back a few months later and decided to take some friends with us for dinner.  We got there just before the dinner rush and were greeted by Chef Marc himself.  He described his specials to us and made recommendations.  Our friends ordered a porterhouse, which the chef carved for them at the table.  My pasta was wonderful and my wife's octopus and eggplant parm was also very good.  \n\nWe love this little hidden place.  This will be a stop every time we go to Vegas.  When in Vegas, get off the Strip!  There's a lot of great food out there."

It makes me wonder if they are paying people to write good reviews. \n\nI went here with my girlfriend and her mother and was very disappointed. When we arrived, we were instructed to seat ourselves, which I do not have a problem with because this is the way it's done in New York at a place like this. It even added to the authenticity of the restaurant. \n\nWe were given menus and after figuring out what we wanted to order, the host came over and took them, but without taking our order. We waited another ten minutes before the waitress came over, without asking if we wanted more drinks, I might add. \n\nWe ordered a beet salad, some veal raviolis, a mushroom pasta and sausage raviolis for the table, as we wanted to share. The only thing that was close to palatable were the sausage raviolis. However, I could only bear to eat a couple as they were over salted. All the pasta was way too al dente for my taste, maybe even being undercooked. The mushrooms in the wild mushroom pasta were obviously dried and not fresh. I could tell because it seemed like they didn't cook them long enough as they were very chewy. The veal raviolis were the worst part. They were bland and fatty, along with the pasta being undercooked. \n\nAfter we finished the beet salad, the plates just sat on the table, taking up space until just before our entrees came out. That kind of thing is very bad form in a restaurant. \n\nAfter we decided that this place is just horrible, we wanted to leave ASAP. We had to yell at the waitress across the dining room to get our check because she was having a very extensive conversation and was not paying attention to any of her tables. We then explained that we were not satisfied with the veal raviolis. To her credit, she did have them taken off the bill, but not before talking to us like we were a bunch of toddlers throwing a fit. I'm still not sure if she was being sarcastic with us or she genuinely thinks people enjoy being talked to like that. \n\nOverall, this place is a disaster. I absolutely do not recommend eating here."

The staff behind the counter asked if I needed help and when I told them what I was looking for, they looked utterly puzzled. They finally\ndid suggest going over the menu again, and if nothing caught my eye, to make a request. So, back to the table I went. My two sons ordered hot sandwiches, one plain, one with cheese, and I ordered a caprese salad (not on the menu). When the food arrived, the sandwiches were packed full of pickles, tomatoes, onions, and etc, so, we sent it back. The second time around, the sandwiches were served on toast but the meat was cold. Impatience was beginning to set in, so I just told the waitress we'd wrap them up and take them home as is. The waitress was very apologetic and ended up not charging us for one of the sandwiches. The caprese salad portion was small, the cheese was sliced thinner and smaller than I'm used to seeing and I didn't like the sweet drizzle they used to fancy it up, but hey, it wasn't on the menu...I don't think I'll ever be back."

It was light, crispy, flavorful but with plenty of body!  It came with a side of aus jus- the ausjus was like an action hero in my opinion.  It was the Superman of dipping sauces.  I had some left in the little dish when I was done, so I asked the waiter for a spoon!\n\nThe sandwich wasn't a true true Italian beef - I don't think the meat was roasted there but it was of good quality.  The sandwich was like a French onion soup Italian beef sandwich!!!  It was everything I love in a sandwich and more...\n\nGreat service, nice and clean - Bravo.
