Waited 45 minutes to get our food because they sent one of our meals to the wrong table. They said they were going to take care of one of the meals and when we got the bill they only took $5 off. Was not happy and asked to talk to the manager and they finally took a meal off our bill. Will not be returning"

We are still at a restaurant, not a rock concert.\nWill never go here again."

I got the cajun prawn pear salad and it was AMAZING!! We also sipped on some delicious mojitos.\n\nOur waitress was patient, friendly, and helpful. I will be back the next time I am in vegas for sure.\n\nIt has been a long time since I had been in a Hard Rock and it was fun to see all the memorabilia. \n\nThis is must do for some food on the strip.\n\nCheers!"

It was way too cold to sit outside when we were there, but I can see giving it a go in April or May, or perhaps on a summer evening.  \n\nEverything else seemed to be the same as all the other HRC's.  The food rarely disappoints.  On this particular occasion, DH and I shared the appetizer sampler platter.  The emphasis on trying to sell merchandise to diners is a little annoying - and half the specialty drinks seem to be an automatic \"pay extra to keep the glass\" deal.   Not wanting to schlep a glass on the airplane, I selected one of the other drinks and it was disappointingly weak, yet expensive.  Should've just avoided the specialty menu and ordered some standard thing.\n\nAs for the music, it should've been called \"The Generally Fairly Mellow Rock Cafe\" - to us, a bit of a disappointment.  Maybe it's more rockin' late at night if the one in Tahoe is any guide."

We were going to hit the Denny's on the Strip, but the line was absurdly long and we had to be somewhere later that morning, so we popped into the Hard Rock Cafe since we saw that they had a breakfast menu.\n\nWe went upstairs to the restaurant and were promptly seated out on the patio which has a great view of the Strip. It was another gorgeous day in Vegas and the sun was starting to really heat things up.\n\nWe started the meal off in a very manly way - mimosas and cocktails. I wasn't originally going to get a big breakfast, but the chicken and biscuits were too tempting. \n\nA short wait later, our food arrived and it was apparent that the kitchen just thought I had ordered a biscuits and gravy as my chicken was quite absent. After waving down a waiter, he said he would take it back to the kitchen and get the chicken. Unfortunately, fried chicken isn't the quickest thing to get done on the fly, so by the time my plate came back, my friends were already done eating. Our waitress was great though, and was actually getting ticked off that the food was taking so long to come back. \n\nWhen it did finally arrive, it looked quite good with a good-sized piece of chicken on two country gravy-slathered biscuits. The golden brown batter was nice and crunchy, although the boneless chicken breast had a texture suggesting that it came from a freezer. The gravy was rich and hearty but the biscuits weren't so much the dense but flaky texture of a good biscuit, but closer to that of cake. It was odd. Not bad, just odd.\n\nMy buddy whose birthday it was received a complimentary birthday sundae and a free glass as well, which was really cool, and the waitress knocked $5 off our bill for all the hassle. All in all, she was a champ.\n\nThe food was kinda meh, but its a great location and the front end service was spot on. Swing on by, just not for the  biscuits."

Then another 20 mins for alcohol drinks... And then another 10 mins for my coffee. The food was awful. Eggs (if that's what you want to call them) had a very weird texture to them. If you ever spent time in the military you'll know what I mean. The service there was non existent. Grant it, there was 11 of us there but that should be no reason why the service was that bad. We asked for butter and the girl pretty much said, \"Well I'm pouring mimosas right now.\" Huh? Ooooooookkkkkkkaaaaaaayyyyyy... Man, don't tell them that the service could have been better cause they'll return with a whole lot of excuses and no ownership of what they could have done better for us. Got double charged for gratuity so I paid with cash which I never do but I felt that I didn't  want to spend another couple of hours there. So again I plead with you... AVOID BREAKFAST THERE AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!"

We got there around 10:45am - greeted and host offered us very good booth - but my daughter (8yrs old) wanted to sit inside - same place where we sat for the first time. Host was very happy to change our tables - no fuss!!! Our server (Star of the whole experience) Ashley came and took our order for beverages.  She even helped us with couple of items in menu and recommeded sauc for my chicken - which happeded to be the best choice.  My daughter was bit upset for somereason and was crying.  Ashley took a note of that but didnt say anything.  Our food came and it was awesome except my daughter didn't like the Pizza she ordered.  She told Ashley when she came to check on us....She took the Pizza off of our check! At the end of our lunch, Ashley said that she has a surprise for my daughter and brought a cup of ice-cream!!! Put a big smile on her (my daughter's) face.... Ashley saved the day for us....She even took a pin (Disney pin) out of her pin belt and gifted to my daughter.  She went above and beyond to make our dining experience awesome and she did that.  \n\nYes the food is bit pricey, but you will enjoy your visit with your date, family, friends, colleagues, spouse or even just treating your self to lunch or dinner!"

We didn't have a place planned to eat and it was not quite dinner time yet. With that said we got sat right away and had an amazing server. The food was also delicious. I had the fish and chips with teo long islands (birthday drinks) and I even got to take a souvenir glass and Dan had a burger. What is great about Las Vegas is if your not finished with your drink you can take it on the strip with you,  and that exactly what I did! \n\nThis Hard Rock really has the best Rock 'n' Roll Memorabilia! While we didnt check any out they have shows as well. If you in Vegas and any kind of a music fan, which I am sure you are, check out this Hard Rock."

Right on top of the stairs, there was a guy there who took photos of anyone who goes to the restaurant. We got seated right away and because of our time crunch, we already knew what we wanted. I ordered a Grilled Alaskan Salmon and hubby got the Jumbo Combo. Both food was very good especially the mash potatoes that game with my dish. They made it with cheese or something similar. It was very cheesy. My husband's dish was huge or jumbo in this case. Service was great and the decor was very rocker chique. I will come back next time but not on such a time crunch.

Our waiter was a super cool/nice guy that came and sat with us as he took our order. My friend was hesitant as to what to order and he suggested The Texan sandwich, my friend loved it!

Every person we interacted with was very friendly and helpful, like above and beyond helpful! Our server was a bit off the wall to look at, but it appears they encourage it here and I think that is why everyone here seemed to really enjoy working for Hard Rock. \n\nI ordered a burger special which was basted in an IPO Bbq sauce, topped with a grilled pineapple, bacon, and some mango salsa. It was a half pound burger, and I was a bit worried about that, because they often end up being bland and dry, but their patty was very high quality and tasty, and cooked a perfect medium rare. My burger was awesome, and I would get it again in a heartbeat. \nI also got my burger with a side of bacon cheese fries which were delicious, the fries were crispy, the cheese was melty, and it was real bacon chopped up and fried to a crisp, no cheap bacon bits here. \n\nMy wife ordered the smokehouse sandwich, which was a pulled chicken sandwich topped off with haystack onions, fried jalape\u00f1os, and a chipotle pur\u00e9e. She thought it was good but wished she had gotten the pork instead, as she isn't a huge fan of pulled chicken, and thought it was a BBQ chicken breast when she ordered it (her oversight in reading the menu) I had a bite or 2 and thought it was really good, the chicken was fresh and had a nice crisp to it, but was also tender, juicy and flavorful. \nI also ordered a \"Strawberry Basil Lemonade\" which was just delicious, and a godsend on such a hot day! Usually the default combo would be mint leaf, but wow basil is my new favorite lemonade additive!\n\nI'm glad we stopped in here, and will make Hard Rock a regular stop from here on out, if I had one complaint it would be that their prices are pretty out of control, but then again what isn't in Vegas?"

First off, they aren't open for breakfast until 8am, which I thought was more than strange considering the crazy hours one makes while in Vegas. I had jet lag during the trip and was eating breakfast at 630am and 730am and heck sometimes my friends weren't getting in til 9am! \n\nAnyway, I digress... I ordered the standard 2 egg breakfast. It was massive. 2 people could easily split it. My only issue is that it was crazy greasy...even for this southern girl. Maybe they make it that way for all the drunks who need the grease to soak up the alcohol but it just made me feel sick. They were nice enough to sub out the bread for fruit and there was a lot of it. Service was a bit slow also. Otherwise, great value for the money."

I ordered the raspberry mint lemonade and it was very good, super refreshing. My husband and I split the chicken ceasar salad and the nachos. The salad was good, I would have liked more dressing but it was still tasty. The nachos are HUGE. Definitely something you could split among 3 or 4 people. They come with cheese, queso sauce, beans, tomatoes, onions, jalepenos and sour cream. We also had a side order of guacamole added to them. They are really good. Down side is that the cheese hardens after the first few minutes and it seems to get cold very fast so eat quickly! Overall it was a good meal.  When we go back to Vegas we won't eat here again, it was good, just nothing that makes me want to ensure a stop there upon our next visit."

We had Four adults and four kids, including two infants, and yet they still treated us like stars (yay!) They brought out a huge dessert after we had paid, just because. ?! I've never seen something like that. Oh, and one of my kids wanted an egg to eat, and they actually just fried up one (which wound up being three, I think) for her. A lot of places won't do that (sad, but true.) \nSo I'll spare you the description since I'm sure most people are aware of what Hard Rocks are like, but you can definitely count on great service and good food (the kids meals were fantastic too.) With all the potentially horrendous tourist experiences in Vegas, this is a sure bet. Highly, highly recommended!!"

Nach den knapp 40 Grad Celsius, die draussen herrschten, war der klimatisierte Innenbereich wie ein kleiner Himmel f\u00fcr uns.\nDer Kellner war zwar freundlich, machte aber den Eindruck, dass alles schnell gehen muss, damit die Pl\u00e4tze z\u00fcgig an die nachkommenden G\u00e4ste weitervergeben werden k\u00f6nnen. Dieser Eindruck best\u00e4tigte sich, als er uns fragte ob wir noch etwas w\u00fcnschen, wir nach der Rechnung verlangten, und er die Rechnung schon fertig dabei hatte.\nVon der Atmosph\u00e4re her ist das Restaurant typisch Hard Rock Cafe: Laute Rockmusik, Star-Memorabilia an den W\u00e4nden und die typische Karte, die aus Burgern, Steaks und den \u00fcblichen Vorspeisen besteht. Man wei\u00df halt, was man bekommt, wenn man ins Hard Rock Cafe geht.\nW\u00e4hrend meine Frau den 'Honey Citrus Grilled Chicken Salat' bestellt hatte, habe ich mir die 'Hickory Smoked BBQ Ribs' mit Pommes, Krautsalat und einem Bohnendip geg\u00f6nnt. Beide Gerichte schmeckten hervorragend, leider waren die Rippchen nur lauwarm. Daf\u00fcr war das Fleisch aber so zart, dass man es mit der Zunge zerdr\u00fccken konnte.\nZum Essen hatten wir noch ein 'Shock Top', eine amerikanische Biersorte, die ein belgisches Bier darstellen soll. War ganz ok, hatten uns aber ein wenig mehr davon versprochen.\nPreistechnisch ist es im Hard Rock Cafe nat\u00fcrlich nicht ganz billig, mit der Rechnung bekamen wir allerdings einen 20%-Rabatt-Gutschein f\u00fcr den Shop und da wir da sowieso einkaufen wollten haben wir noch nebenbei 6$ gespart."

I witnessed the staff giving genuine recommendations to tourists, and joking around with the occasional local that stops by. \n\nBeyond the typical HRC experience, I've been very impressed with the concert venue on the top floor. I've seen both international acts and local acts in the concert hall. During concerts the venue is very intimate, and there is not a bad seat (mostly standing room, but you get the idea) in the house save the area behind the bar that overlooks the strip. \n\nThe sound is good, not the best I've seen, but for the type of venue it is more than adequate. \n\nI look forward to concerts at the HRC because the parking is easy (just park in the Showcase mall, you have to pay, but it is worth it), and you can always see the band. The security can be a little hardcore (patting down kids at an all ages show), but as far as small venues go on the Strip, this one is outstanding."

We felt so bad for him because you could tell how hard he was trying and she made him look like he kept messing up. I felt so bad for the guy, that's not a good way to train employees in my opinion. After they leave the table she could have offered suggestions for improvement not correct him on the spot, that doesn't promote confidence. Before we were done eating the guy stopped by our table to say goodbye and that they were sending him home. The lady that was training him came over shortly afterward to say that he had to go home and it wasn't because of anything he did wrong. HOW AWKWARD!\n \nAside from that I ordered a huge burger and yes I ate the entire thing, it was yummy :). I ordered a Bloody Mary and it wasn't the best, nor were the onion rings that accompanied my burger. My friend said her Mac and cheese was good but not the best. The meal ended up being pretty pricey but I would prob go back, especially if it was during happy hour or something :)."

The third floor venue is a bit of a hike for a lazy bum like me.  I took the stairs though there is an optional elevator.  I was concered how the concert was going to be pulled off given the nature of the act.  I saw GWAR, a group known for eleborate stage shows that saturate the audience, floor and surrounding areas with a red simulated blood and green slime.  I noticed when I walked in the memorabilia walls and support columns were wrapped in plastic sheets.  Smart move.  Security was tight upon entering.  Everybody had to take everything out of their pockets and get patted down and wanded.  It took a while (think busy airport) but I felt safe.  During the show security guards were taking down crowd surfing drunks.  It was entertaining.  Over all, the concert venue at the Hard Rock is like a bigger, cleaner and more modern looking version of the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay.  They have very similar set ups.  Down side of the eveing, the cheapest beer was PBR for $5.  That is a lot to pay for a pint of PBR.  That complaint aside, I had a great time for a great price (ticket cost).  I plan to go back if they continue to bring in the good acts."

The menu is still standard American fare.  The best part is the memorabilia on the walls. Hardly anyone was there when we went for brunch on a Sunday, so we were able to wander around the restaurant and look at the stuff to our heart's content.\n\nMy only beef was that they said they served breakfast/brunch but I didn't see any breakfast items on the menu.  Maybe we were too late, but doesn't brunch usually run until 2pm on Sundays?"

The problem was the service.\n\nWe went here for lunch on a weekday, probably around 11am (it was early and lunch had just started).  We were STARVING, which is why we were eating on the strip in the first place.\n\nThere were only three tables, including us.  The place was pretty much empty.\n\nAfter being seated with menus, we were deserted.  We did not see another employee for at least 20 minutes, and when we managed to flag him down and ask where our server was (I mean, it's not like they were busy), he said that he'd go get our server.  It was a while later before the server finally showed up to take our order.\n\nAgain, we were starving.\n\nAfter ordering, it happened all over again.  We thought that, surely, after leaving us with NO service after being seated they'd be attentive and get our order through fast.  (Still, only about three tables were seated, including us).  Boy were we wrong!  Our orders took FOR EVER.  A table that had arrived about ten minutes after us paid their bill and left about ten minutes before the food ever showed up.  I haven't experienced that kind of wait at any restaurant on a busy night on the strip ever.\n\nAfter having to hunt down our food, we finally ate and our server apologized for the delay.  We were very dissatisfied and when he brought the bill he said he'd apply his employee discount to make up for the bad service, but that was all he could do.  His discount was 5%.  Meh.  It was pretty expensive anyway (being on the strip) and little that discount didn't really rectify much.  Also, I figure places like these usually have coupons or gift cards or something to give out in a situation like this and we didn't get anything like that.\n\nThe only reason this is two stars instead of one is that 1) the food was insane and 2) at least the server made some kind of tiny effort to acknowledge our bad experience by giving the slight discount.  But I still can't get what the delay was.  Maybe their server was also the chef.  And the hostess.  And the bartender.  And the janitor.  And the guy out front entertaining pedestrians..."

We arrived around 8:45 on a Saturday night with a party of 12 and were fortunately seated within 30 minutes-the restaurant was not crowded at all. That alone should probably say something. The reason my group picked this as a dinner spot was due to the number of picky eaters and unwillingness to stray too far from their hotel. This was 100% not my choice to eat dinner here, but with so many good reviews, I figured there might be something that was appealing.\nAfter we were seated, our server brought us menus right away and drinks came quickly along with the nacho appetizers we ordered for the table. That part of the meal was fine-no complaints here. Nachos were run of the mill-not bad but nothing stellar. It turned out that I was glad these were ordered, because my actual meal was terrible.\nI ordered the Veggie burger-on the menu it's clear this is not an ordinary veggie burger. It comes topped with \"roasted\" veggies-Portobello, zucchini, peppers and onions. On paper that sounded good but the execution was lacking. The veggies were flavorless, soggy and oily. The veggie patty itself didn't seem well cooked and had an odd taste to it. The fries it came with were okay-nothing that stood out-adequate but the disappointment in the veggie burger itself outweighed any goodness there.\nI'm sure the kitsch value of this place has value to some people but for me this a waste of time, money and an opportunity to have a good meal after a long day of adventures in Vegas. Never again."

While it's impressive in theory, the more interesting and fun techie toy we found was just in the waiting area. It was a table top touch screen, reminiscent of the old pac-man tables often found in restaurants during the 80s/90s, but WAY MORE AWESOME... er, well, those were pretty sweet too. \n\nI'm drifting...\n\nSo the interactive rock wall has random images of memorabilia floating around which you can drag and touch click and enlarge... and is quite large, with basically 6 docking stations for 6 users to peruse the floating options. However, the table top touch screens had a search feature so you could choose whose junk you got to look at. We immediately searched for the Boss's items in the collection, enjoying the i-whatever type technology that allowed us to pinch and spread our fingers on the screen to zoom in and out and read old setlists and the like. \n\nFun times for music geeks.\n\nI believe these are the same kinds of screens we saw in the booths, but our table didn't have one to play with... so if you want to enjoy that part of the place, ask specifically to sit near one! \n\nOh yeah and as far as the food went, it was fine, just as at all Hard Rocks, although I give extra props to the waitress who noticed me order my veggie burger without cheese and asked if I was vegan.\n\n**Side note, vegans, don't plan to eat here. There's really nothing for you. That veggie burger had cheese in it, and I was so grateful that she let me know!!! The option for a side salad is there, but it won't really fill you... with food or nutrients since it was all iceberg or other light-colored lettuces with practically no vitamins."

The original Paradise/Harmon location (which is in front of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino), and this one, which is on the Las Vegas Strip itself. \n\nIf you are not familiar with the Hard Rock Cafe chain of restaurants, you have clearly been living under a rock for the past few decades. Essentially, they combine great food and tons of awesome musical memorabilia and the like on display. These places are a music fan's dream come true. \n\nThe Hard Rock Cafe on the Strip is unique because it is set up in a 3-story arrangement. The first floor and main entrance is the gift shop. The second floor is the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant itself. And the third floor is a bar/concert venue. \n\nAs far as the concert venue goes, this place is excellent. I went in here for the first time the other night to see Dio Disciples, and the size of the venue is just right. It is intimate, but still manages to fit a ton of music fans. Plus the sound quality is excellent. You can stand by the stage, or go to the bar or a table/chair to sit down, so you'll be well off either way. There is even a balcony with a kick-ass view of the Strip exterior.\n\nMost of my complaints with the place stem from the entrance/location/lines for shows/etc. Being on the Las Vegas Strip, just getting to the associated Showcase Mall parking garage can be a challenge (it costs $3 to park in this garage, but it is far and above your best option.) Finding the garage is tricky because the signs directing you there are so small and easy to miss. Likewise, to get into the show, we had to wait in a line, and the line actually went up a flight of stairs. Traversing stairs is fine, but being forced to wait on them in a crowd for long periods of time is not pleasant. Also, expect the full \"being carded/pat down/metal detector\" treatment. \n\nBut all things considered, once you find the parking garage and a show that you want to go to, or even if you're just wandering the Strip and want to shop and eat, this place is great. Definitely worth your time, whether you're a local or a tourist."

So here goes ...\n\nFood is just alright; and the view is nice if you get seated with one. I have had salads (monstrous in size); burgers (usually cooked to the incorrect specified temperature [charred like a motherfucker]); and, fries (just fries: nothing special). In fact, the entire restaurant can be summed up to just that: Nothing Special. \n\nPro Tip: there is usually a coupon for money off of one's cheque in those Vegas2Go\u2122 magazines found all around the strip corridor. They are small (brochure-sized) and red and white. - E"

There are huge windows near the bar, overlooking all the chaos outside.  The bar area is quite nice, although, in true bar fashion, the drinks are too expensive.  It was fairly dead in there (being a Sunday night) and the bartender was pretty cool. I had ordered a Vodka Cranberry, and it was waaay too expensive, but poured with Smirnoff.  Being a bit of a vodka snob, I asked the bartender how much is the different to pour Ketel One or Chopin.  It was $1.50; cool. Next drink I ordered, I'd get it that way.\n\nSo I turn to talk to my friends, and a few minutes later, the bartender brings me a new vodka cranberry, with Chopin to replace my original drink and wasn't charging me for the difference.  What a nice guy!  Later in the night he also gave one of the girls in our party a round of shots for us. They were terrible! But they were free =)\n\nThe area to watch the band/dance is spacious with a good amount of tables.  The band itself, Sin City Sinners, was good, as always. I have seen them a few times and they're full of energy and awesome hard rock!\n\nAs we stumbled down the stairs at the end of the night (be careful!), we stopped at a couple tabletop arcade style games and played for a while.  That was fun too!"

            "review": "I'll start by saying the service in Las Vegas restaurants (particularly on the Strip) seem to have one common theme - POOR SERVICE\n\nThe Hard Rock Cafe is no exception to this observation. \n\nI get it. You work in a tourist trap. You get mixed (good and bad) tips regardless of effort because you are serving people from different cultures and different tipping beliefs, but that shouldn't mean you just disappear. \n\nThis week my girlfriend and I met up for lunch with a couple of friends that happened to also be visiting Vegas. We tried to get them to choose a non-chain, but they argued that they knew what to expect with a chain. Fine... Hard Rock it was. \n\nWe walked in, walked up the stairs, put our name down. The place was basically empty since it was about 2:00 p.m., so we were seated in about 5 minutes. This is where the service begins and ends. \n\nWe sat there with menus for 15 minutes (this is no exaggeration) . We flagged down several people and asked them if they could find a server for us, but instead they just kept walking by obnoxiously singing along with the music playing in the background (or in some cases, just shouting out lyrics to unrelated songs). I THINK the servers think this is 'entertaining', but I can tell you that none of us at our table were impressed - especially after waiting that long. \n\nOnce the waiter arrived (sweating), he apologized profusely, feeding us with several disjunct reasons. We presented him with 2 for 1 drink cards that were distributed by the people standing in front of the restaurant. He seemed to be clueless as to their validity. He ran back to his manager and came back confirming the 'deal'. We were debating on whether or not this waiter was drunk, as he just seemed disconnected.\n\nAnyway... We ordered our food. It was what you expect from any chain restaurant like this, fairly bland, generic, etc. If you are not familiar with Hard Rock Cafe, it is basically a TGIFriday or Chili's with a Rock-n-Roll theme (walls covered in rock memorabilia). Needless to say, you are paying for the ambiance and to look at the rock memorabilia, not the food. Once you wrap your head around that, the prices are... well... still too high for what you get.\n\nI would suggest avoiding all of the 'sit-down' restaurants that have doors that open to the Strip. They have a non-stop line of customers coming in, so they know they don't need to work hard. As for the Hard Rock Cafe, I would just avoid it regardless of the country you are in. This is a relic from the 70s and 80s that just doesn't know when it is time to close the doors."

They are located along the Strip between Ross and Denny's, and across from the Monte Carlo. Their lower floor is a retail store while the restaurant and bar are situated upstairs - they offer ample indoor seating, as well as a small amount of outdoor seating on their balcony. Atmosphere is loud, casual, and energetic, with multiple TVs featuring music videos.\n\nMy husband and I ate an early lunch here during the week. We sat outside, and although it was a very hot day, we appreciated the misters, fans, and shade. Service was quick (for the most part), food was good, and cocktails were really, really yummy. I was pretty impressed!\n\nDon't know if they do this at all HRC locations, but this one gave us their cocktail cups as souvenirs with every drink order. Pretty neat! Would definitely return if we're back in the area."

I said 3 and they said ok we will put you in the back. Didn't understand why we were being buried in the back and I felt somewhat insulted. Not worried about it because I will never go here again. This is why I am writing this to make sure that none of my friends or fellow yelpers get hosed like I did. It gets better so please read on. \n\nShortly after being seated our waiter Larry showed up and seemed very nice. My wife ordered a water, my daughter ordered a pink lemonade and I ordered a Guinness. Larry was slick with pressuring my wife to order a frozen drink. I noticed that on the menu you could ask the waiter about purchasing a pint glass or a hurricane glass for an additional fee. we were never offered if we even wanted to purchase the glasses. Larry decided that we needed them. When I ordered my meal I ordered The Texan. I ate the meal and it was not that bad. Larry was helpful and courteous. Then I got the bill and found that I was charged the 17.50 super sized price for the meal vs the 13.50 price that I noticed was on the menu. I didn't ask nor was I offered the super sized meal for the 17.50 price. Larry was slick again and had gotten over on me. I had not noticed anything at this point on the check. Larry tried to get us to have dessert but we passed on it. Larry had asked me to do a customer survey as he gets great feedback from his job. I assured him that I would give him feedback. He also sat at our table and tried to explain something else to us about a menu item that was not on our table. we declined to have it and Larry said I just had to tell you about it because I always forget.\n\nThis Larry guy basically got over on us and made us pay for things that we really didn't want. I could have gone back up stairs and made a scene but I figured I would just tell everyone what they did to me and hope that no one else gets taken. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!! I am sure that his company makes him do these things to people and this is why you must go down stairs to pay for your meal. They are a sneaky and they got me this once. Never again!!

Maybe a couple of hundred people attended, yet the space was comfortable - the temperature was never too hot or too cold, and I never felt it was crowded. It was easy to get to different areas, like the bar, dance floor and major seating areas. The covered balcony overlooking Las Vegas Blvd was a nice spot to see the bustling street, and floor to ceiling windows meant we didn't have to go outside to see the Strip. \n\nThe dance floor was pretty decent- great lighting and a stage for the DJ.

Go to the new one on the strip and prepare to have your music loving mind blown!\n\nI stopped by just a couple of days after what was the \"soft opening\".  My server says a big grand opening event will happen in October and Chris Cornell will perform.  More on that later.\n\nThis has to be the biggest and most detailed Hard Rock anywhere.  According to the staff it's been in the works for four years and it shows.  It's prime location on the strip is just the start.  Once you walk in you'll get a number that directs you to the second or third level dining areas.  I got level 3 which features a huge split level dining hall, full size bar and a small intimate stage for live acts at the back of the room. (see Chris Cornell above). The number of mouths this place can feed at a time is huge at more than 800 seats.  Just imagine the kitchen on a busy night!\n\nThe food is the same menu at any Hard Rock.  I got a bacon cheeseburger which was a lot better than expected, especially the bacon.  Pricing at 13 bucks is a little high but you are on the strip and at the best HRC ever built.  It would be nice if the drink menu included pricing.  It was relatively slow when I was there.  And since all the staff is new they are eager to please and clearly instructed to go for the upsell.\n\nAfter the meal you can just roam around and that's where it gets really fun.  The path to the third floor restroom is lined with infamous and at times chilling news headlines of the deaths of Lennon, Elvis and both Kennedys.  On a lighter note, a special room is dedicated to wedding memorabilia.  Elvis and Priscilla, John and Yoko, Ike and Tina and my heart skipped a beat when I came across a signed acoustic from Kurt Cobain at the Kurt and Courtney section.  Another awesome moment was a drum set from White Zombie mounted on the wall as you go down the stairs.\n\nAnother thing that makes this place unique is all the interactive technology.  Lots of Microsoft Surface tables and a huge touchscreen wall where you can check out everything that's on site.\n\nIf this doesn't become the flagship HRC soon I will be shocked.  Anyone who loves music (anyone with a pulse) needs to grab a meal or drink here."

On the strip sometimes it's hit or miss with encountering service people who actually act like they love their job. \n\nIf you had the privilege of seeing the previous Hard Rock Cafe this one just blows the old one out of the water! Very spacious and spread out, on the third level which is where I spent my evening is a nice sized stage and dancing area, with tables around the outside rim if you wanted to sit and listen to the music. Upstairs (and on the 2nd level) they also have an outside patio overlooking the strip. Inside is typical bar and dinner seating, as well as a section of secluded lounge chairs. (They have these little loungey areas on the second level too.) The tables around the couches act as a touch computer screen where you can play videos and flip through photos all with the touch of your finger!\n\nSince the event was hosted, I can't comment on cost or really the food, as they just had passed h'ordeuvres. Everything was fried, which is OK, but I know they were trying to feed the masses and those items were probably the cheapest. \n\nI tried the coconut shrimp, pot stickers and egg rolls, not much to say, they didn't have any flare or kick to them that would make them stand out from any other bar, but having eaten at Hard Rock's across the country I know they always do a solid American Cuisine- Love the there veggie burger! \n\nThis would be a fun place to get a group together for a dinner party or birthday. Would definitely go back."

I haven't had a chance to actually eat in the cafe yet, so this review is purely for the building as a venue.\n\nIt's actually a pretty impressive spot. The bottom floor is the gift shop. If you're a Hard Rock junkie, I'm sure you'll find something to take home with you. The second floor is where the actual cafe resides.  It has a nice size with a balcony that overlooks the strip. In the waiting area are Microsoft Surface tables where you can play around with music-related trivia and activities.\n\nThe third floor houses a small museum, a bar, and a stage area for small concerts. During the grand opening, I got to see Chris Cornell perform. This is also where the Motley Brews event occurred. It's a nice open space for these types of events. It also has a balcony overlooking the strip.\n\nI think it's a little strange that we now have two Hard Rock Cafes and one Hotel in Vegas. I haven't been to the other cafe in about 17 years, but I can only imagine that this new one blows that one away. Then again, if you're a Hard Rock junkie (like a few people we met at the grand opening), you'll visit and appreciate both places.\n\nOverall, this is a good addition to the strip."

The ambiance is outstanding, as is the sound system, but the quality of the food left quite a bit to be desired.  I visited with my wife.  She ordered a BBQ plate and I ordered the New York strip steak ($27.95).  While my wife's meal came out fine, mine was barely warm.  The mashed potatoes were cold and stiff, the gravy congealed and the green beans cold and hard.  I normally don't send food back because I've heard all of the horror stories, but I couldn't stand the thought of paying this much for a barely tolerable meal, so back it went.  I will say that the server and management were spot on though -- the server apparently notified the manager who came to my table to apologize and offered me a salad to keep me busy while waiting for a new meal.  When the 2nd meal arrived, it was much better.  The cut of beef was not quite as tender as I'd like for a N.Y. strip, but it had good flavor.  I just wish that there was an option for a baked potato rather than mashed potatoes, but alas - there were no baked potatoes to be found on the menu.  All in all, dinner came out to a little over $70 for two -- but the ambiance made up for what the food quality lacked.  You have to pay for parking too an it's not validated."

So I took a seat at the bar and ordered.\n\nI had a SOB Burger, which is a cheeseburger with guac and chipotle. It was kind of uninspiring as far as a burger goes - massive, but I felt like the chipotle flavor was played down. Also it fell apart after the first couple of bites - to be fair, I think they anticipated it, they gave me a big ass steak knife to go with it. The fries were really good.\n\nAlcohol: I gave up drinking after the first two rounds, because my draft Newcastle Ale was 5.60. Don't drink on the Strip if you're a local, you will always be disappointed. The bartender was attentive to my needs and cashed me out quickly.\n\nThe Concert: The real reason to come here is that the third floor is a MASSIVE concert space. It's a really nice venue, and they've been booking really interesting gigs. The bar service looked good, but like I said, I quit indulging after dinner so I don't know about the service/prices."

We  signed in OK, when our pager light up, we went up to the hostess stand expecting to be seated.  No, that was just to tell us to stand in a different spot. I have a hard time standing so I had given up my seat while waiting, If we knew we had to wait again, I would have stayed where I was!! Then we passed up several empty tables and booths to be seated in the back by the kitchen.  They then took forever before our waiter came over and another 30 minutes to get our sodas and lemonade. Then it was an hour before we got our food.  At one point, our waiter did come over and we were talking to him and the people at the next table called him and he turned around and waited on them.  We were mid sentence and he left us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That was so incredibly rude!!!!  Then when the other table left and they were cleaning off the table, the busboy stacked the glasses so high that the bottom glass shattered from the pressure.  There was glass all over and they only cleaned up part of it, my husband was trying to point out more glass and they obviously DID NOT like it being pointed out.  So he got up to go find the manager and told him what all was going on. He did come by our table for about 2 seconds and said he would go check on our food. That obviously upset the kitchen.  One son ordered a BBQ bacon burger and it was so dry and bland (no BBQ sauce on it and burger itself was dry and flavorless) that he could not eat.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it also was dry! I only ate about a quarter of it. My other son is usually ravenous and eats anything. I gave him half of my sandwich and he only took 1 bite and said no thanks.  Anyway, that gives you an idea of what we thought of the food.  And the table with the broken glass, well we kept pointing out where more glass was and they finally finished cleaning BUT there was still more broken glass under the table.  I hope that whoever sits at that table with sandals on and cuts there foot sees this so they know it was pure negligence on the part of the restaurant!!!!"

Kind of hard to screw up corn chips and cheese, so kudos to the Hard Rock for that.\n\nThe special that night was a portabello mushroom sandwich, which seemed to be a reasonably healthy alternative to everything else on the menu. But it was so slathered in cheese and this obnoxious mayo concoction that it really was as much a greasy, drippy mess as any burger.

It was also fun voting for the music that would be played next, but we kept getting beaten out.\n\nThe service was meh.  Stupid jokes from the waitress asking us what band we were in.  Yes, because obviously if we were in a band and playing in Las Vegas we'd totally be eating at the Hard Rock Cafe on the Strip... ugh.  Also, this was kind of annoying - my boyfriend's ID picture is really old when he was younger, chubbier, and just had his wisdom teeth out, so in a word he looks kinda bad.  He's aware of that.  The waitress I guess in an attempt to... I don't know make him feel better?  Went on and on and on about how she shouldn't even accept the ID because it looks nothing like him now and how's he's gotten way more attractive... wtf?\n\nThe food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.  My food was one degree above cold and my boyfriends food ended up making him sick.  The waitress never came back with condiments we asked for and we considered doing a runner because it was taking so long to get the check... and we were one of six occupied tables....\n\nSo all and all avoid this place if you can.  I've been to many a Hard Rock in my life, but this was the worst as far as food and service go.  One of the best as far as decor go.  Take it for what you will."

I recently had dinner there, and stayed for a club that was being promoted by some hip hop dj's, which was on the 3rd floor.  \n\nThe food at the hard rock is not bad.  By not bad I mean it taste like most chain restaurants, so stick to the salads and burgers, you don't want to venture out there too far.\n\nThe club was a beauty.  I loved the layout.  Nice bar.  Excellent outdoor patio overlooking the strip.  Clean restroom.  Plenty of space to dance.  I went Saturday Night, and the crowd was small for a Saturday, however, it was big enough to party and not feel like the place was empty.  I liked the idea of being in a club in Vegas with good music, yet not being cattled around like most clubs on the strip.  I believe with the right promotion this place could be one of the hottest spots on the strip for a club (especially since Poetry aka OPM is no longer open)."

Most of them lingered in the back by the bar and windows, leaving the entire floor open for the taking. We opted to take about 15 square feet touching the stage, right in front of the lead singer's microphone. We saw Psychedelic Furs this night. I posted a pic taken from our piece of land. Pretty darned impressive! I never thought I'd have Richard Butler sweat on me, but I'll be damned if that didn't happen. \n\nThe chicken shits soon realized, \"oh, hey, it sure would be cool to be down there in front\" and they tried to commandeer our space.

Yes, we are in Vegas, but if you are not going to be a buffet or fancy then you better be cheap.\n\nOh Hard Rock food, I have a 3 star feeling about you:\n\n-=-Hickory Smoked Pork Belly Sliders-=- Too bready for the meat and flavor content. Pork Belly is so yummy when it leaks it's juices all over your bread. Wasn't the case here.\n\n-=-Braised Short Rib Tacos-=- They weren't stuffed by any means, but I felt were the most tasty of the bunch. The bites into these were the most enjoyable I had for this meal.\n\n-=-Nacho Mama Fried Jalapenos-=- These were a crispy surprise, but then again you dip anything in ranch and I'm a fan. Dip my napkin in ranch and I'd probably faint.\n\n-=-Twisted Mac and Cheese-=- We ordered this outside of the Yelp menu. It was all tons of cheesy. For what it was, without meat additives (ignoring the chicken on top, doesn't count), it was a good blend, but was still missing something. Can't put a finger to it.\n\nOh Michael, so awesome you were as our server. You were 5 star awesome. The Yelp Elites were in town and you delivered. We'll be sure to post of our group photo here.

Sound is pretty good in here but depends on the setup can get loud in a small space. \n\nIt was a fairly decent place for a beer fest, given that it wasn't too busy but this can be a clusterfuck if it was double the amount of people. \n\nOverall, good non club venue for music. \n\n(Yelp 100 Challenge 4/100)"

Wir waren zum Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck da und es fiel zumindest mir sehr schwer, etwas herauszusuchen, bei dem ich nicht ins Zuckerkoma falle oder platze. Wenig gibt es nicht.\nEine belgische Waffel mit Schlagsahne und Erdbeeren klingt lecker. Zum Kaffee. Aber nicht als erstes Mahl des Tages. Zumindest nicht f\u00fcr jemanden wie mich, der daheim in Deutschland gar nicht fr\u00fchst\u00fcckt. Ich entschied mich f\u00fcr ein Roggen-Sandwich mit d\u00fcnnem Rindfleisch. Das war auch wahnsinnig lecker, die Hash Browns daneben waren f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich vollkommen \u00fcberfl\u00fcssig. Um uns k\u00fcmmerten sich drei Kellnerinnen, die verbl\u00fcffenderweise alle falsche Wimpern trugen und eine damit fast erschlugen. Trotz der noch fr\u00fchen Tageszeit (ca. 9 Uhr, da schl\u00e4ft man in LV eigentlich noch seinen Rausch aus), hatten wir auf der Au\u00dfenterrasse Livemusik, die S\u00e4ngerin war klasse. Der Ausblick ist toll. \nNur wenn man abends vorbei geht, finde ich es nervig. Aus Boxen pl\u00e4rrt die Musik es gibt extra einen DJ. Nur den Tontechniker h\u00e4tte man auch noch investieren sollen, da alles v\u00f6llig \u00fcbersteuert und verzerrt klingt. Dabei stehen dann M\u00e4dels, die wie Cheerleader angezogen sind und animieren einen lauthals, ins Cafe zu kommen. Der Anblick der Au\u00dfenfassade ist zumindest von der anderen Seite des Strips bei Nacht imponierend. Warum drei Sterne? Weil es ein Hard Rock Cafe ist, dass es \u00fcberall sonstwo auch gibt :)\n\nThere's not too much that can go wrong when choosing a Hard Rock Cafe. We had breakfast there and personally, I had difficulties finding something in the menu that would not catapult me into a diabetic coma or makes me explode all over the place. Small portions don't exist here.\nA Belgian waffle with whipped cream and strawberries sounds great - for an afternoon coffee. But not for the meal I begin my day with. At least for someone like me who always skips breakfast. I decided to take a rye sandwich with roast beef... It was really good, the hash browns as a side being completely unnecessary (I know, Americans luv it though). We had at least three waitresses caring for us, all of them astonishingly had false lashes which almost struck us dead :) Despite the early hour (about 9 am, you should usually sleep off your hangover in LV) we had live music on the balcony. The singer was awesome. The view is amazing.\nOnly if you pass by at night, I think it's rather annoying. Loud music blares from speakers, there's even a DJ. Why on earth didn't they invest in a sound engineer as well? Everything sounds distorted and overloaded. Next to the DJ are girls dressed as cheerleaders trying to whine you into entering the cafe. The view from the other side of the Strip on the facade is impressive at night. Why there's only 3 stars? Because it's a Hard Roc Cafe that you can find anywhere else :)"

We got to Tuesday Blend pretty darn early around 10 to where there were no people on the dance floor or anything, so I basically persuaded/pushed my boyfriend to go downstairs and go get some appetizers/food just to kill time and also because we never tried it.\nSo we went downstairs and the staff was so friendly. Passing through Hard Rock, the restaurant always looks nice on the outside, but actually sitting and being there was a lot nicer than I expected. I wanted to sit at the bar because I assume that's always the quickest service, but we actually got a window seat, which was perfect... better than the bar area and we just people watched. We got quick service with a nice waiter with funny and nice coworkers who all seemed to get along very well, which is good for them and the job itself.\nAnyhow we ordered two burgers. I don't remember the name, but I believe my boyfriend got something mushroom(?) and I got something jalape\u00f1o(?), but it was so delicious. The meat was cooked perfect! The meat wasn't hard like some other restaurants and it didn't taste like it was right out of the freezer or anything. It tasted so fresh and so juicy.\nFood was good. Customer service was cool. Environment/atmosphere was chill. Window seat was amazing. If we ever go to Tuesday Blend again, I wouldn't be surprised if we stopped by the restaurant again. :)"

It looked like the balcony/patio seating was pretty busy, though, I will definitely check that out the next time I go.\n\nWe sat at the high-tops in the bar area and ordered a round of drinks while perusing the menu. We were both pretty hungry, but debated splitting a plate after looking over the prices. Now, Hard Rock has always been a pretty pricey eatery, but I guess when in Vegas you think, \"I could get like, two drinks for the price of that hamburger.\" I ordered a bloody mary (gin) and my friend ordered a specialty drink that came in a souvenir glass. I knew before the check came that her drink would be at least $15. \n\nAnd I was right. My well gin bloody mary was about $7 while her floofy tanning-lotion reminiscent bath water cost her double. Here's a tip: never assume the server is trying to get you to order what they like best, they are trying to UPSELL. They will want to sell you the most expensive thing on the menu. \n\nOur server had a bit of an attitude when he messed up my bloody mary but hey, I used to be a server and I know I was within my rights. Fix it. I'm not drinking vodka. We left within about 20 minutes to find a cheaper place to eat.\n\nOne cool note, however, a manager was making rounds asking guests where they were from and taking msuic video requests. I requested Cinderella and my friend Journey and both were played prior to our departure. What a cool idea!\n\nI would think that Hard Rock would be more.... Hard Rock. It seems like this place has gotten a little soft. Where's the rock'n'roll, the tattoos, the black hair, the leather and lace? Perhaps I need to come back at night, when the Disneyland families with their porkchop kids are safely tucked in to their beds at Circus Circus."

The drinks, view of the strip from the patio and still being hung over from an awesome vacation are the only reasons why this place receive a two.

First, upon stepping inside, there are about six screens which show Hard Rock Cafes in different cities of the world, live, allowing us to really watch what is happening in each of these venues, thousands of miles away.  I spent a few moments to watch diners in Beijing!  We went for drinks and for lunch, and while we were making our way to the bar/restaurant on the second floor, we spent time admiring outfitsworn by different pop icons which were diplayed in glass cases throughout. We also amused ourselves with the various interactive screens with music videos and interviews.  Once we sat down, we ordered tequila shots and some drinks.  They had the tequila we wanted and I had a really great mojito.  The food is the typical fare of Hard Rock Cafe...bar food, and some salads....I did, however, really enjoy my chicken salad.  Our server was super friendly and told us that they have live music on the third level every night and a DJ one night.  He then brought passes to get in without paying cover.  After that, we scored some rodeo gear from the Coors Girls, as the rodeo was passing though town and a cowboy was signing autographs. After lunch, we went to the balcony to check out the view, which overlooks the strip, across from the Monte Carlo.  Then, we went upstairs to check out the music club, though it was not open yet, as it was lunchtime.  The third level has an impressive circular bar and a full stage that reminds me of the House of Blues.  I cannot wait to go back and check out a show one night."

The food is standard to all locations and my favorite dishes the giant sampler for an appetizer with a rack of ribs as the main course always hits the spot. The drinks are fine and I rotate through a few favorites to obtain my collectors hurricane glass. The staff was ok not up to standards of the normal hard rock cafe's. The manager did make an effort to meet and greet with all the patrons so that was a plus."

For starters, the sound was better than other Hard Rock locations that I've been to and the layout of the place was  spacious and inviting, allowing a patron to see everything everywhere, no matter what room one might be standing in.  They had some very cool memorabilia on the walls, just as we've all come to expect of the Hard Rock, except this time it appears that they put a lot more thought into the color schemes than what I've seen before.\nThe bar had a great selection and surprisingly reasonable prices - considering its high profile location - and that was pretty much the icing on the cake for ensuring my return."

Only downside was the prices.\n\nThe second time? I don't think I will ever go back. We had a waitress named Amy, with a high pitched and shrill voice, who forgot our drinks numerous times.As well as trying to be a bit too friendly, stealing one of my prize stuffed animals to my side and saying I should watch better...very comforting to know that my stuff could be stolen from me as I eat. Yes, she was nice and ok as a waitress I guess...but once it came to the bill, it said \"We added an 18% optional tip for your convenience\". The tip was going to be 25 dollars...we decided 15 would be good enough.\n\nAs we left, she ran after us saying we \"were a bit shy\" from the amount due, We gladly pointed out that the tip was optional, but it seems Ms. Amy was NOT happy about it. \"I aim for 20%\" That's fine, but you didn't get it. She got mad and said she needed to talk to the manager before we left. This got us very angry, because she treated us like thieves or something.  She then came back 10 mins later saying \"We can go\". Well, if I would have known she'd be pissy about a tip I'd have taken the tip back."

Margaritas were good, about $15, at the end of your meal they give you your receipt and you go to the store downstairs and you get a \"free\" monogrammed margarita glass.. Kinda cool if you care about something like that?   The hamburger that they are supposedly known for kinda sucks.  The patty looks/tasted like it was microwaved and wasn't medium like we ordered it was def well done. The main reason we came here was the awesome outside seating and view of the strip! Def was a plus. Other than that beers were fairly priced and was a good time?"

Virtually any conceivable trinket, souvenir, or swag emblazoned with the Hard Rock Cafe logo is down there somewhere.\n\nYelp's check-in & the \"cafe\" portion of Hard Rock Cafe were upstairs. With checking into YSB came voucher tickets for a free Bacardi Torched Cherry cocktail at the Hard Rock Cafe bar. Go to the bar for a free drink? Don't gotta ask me twice...\n\nSo, the girlfriend & I sidled up to the bar. Service was extremely friendly & we got our cocktails in a jiffy. While sipping our refreshingly free drinks, we noticed a small menu of items specifically for Yelp: Pork Belly Sliders, Braised Short Rib Tacos & Fried Stuffed Jalapenos.\n\nI ordered all 3 to sample. Our food was taking a while, but our bartender went back to check it out & we had our order shortly after. The Tacos & the Jalapenos were excellent, flavorful, nicely spicy & were served with knockout delicious dipping sauces. Comparatively, the Pork Belly Sliders were a little bland.\n\nAll 3 dishes were tapa-sized, so there was room for dessert. We got the Caramel Xango. Oh. My. God! Now that alone was worth walking into the building for. Cheesecake wrapped in tortilla, deep-fried, & then served with whipped cream + caramel & strawberry sauces drizzled all over everything. Wow.\n\nWhile chewing & sipping, we took in the Hard Rock ambiance. Lots of glass & steel with plenty music memorabilia throughout. It's pretty cool. For the most part the food was pretty good too & service was top notch. After squaring the tab, we exited the same way we came in, through the gift shop."

I ordered the nachos however, and those were very bad. I added chicken to the order but I think that made it even worse. There was a funky taste that wasn't so pleasant. And they add some weird green sauce on top (I don't think it was guacamole though). I definitely wouldn't order them again. I've had my fair share of nachos; these were the worst. \n\nService was good though. Very friendly waitress (crystal).

For an appetizer we have bacon wrapped jalapeno's. I thought this was gonna be a run of the mill popper, but it was actually a whole jalapeno stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon. It was AMAZING! And super spicy, which is how I like it! For dinner, I had the filet mignon and asked to add on blue cheese, which was not a problem at all. It was super good. My boyfriend got the fish n' chips, which is odd cause he hates seafood, but he enjoyed it. The drinks are kind of pricey, but hey, it's the strip so it's not uncommon.

The food is great, the atmosphere is unique (its just like all the other HRCs) but his particular visit was more about the service than the food or atmosphere. \n\nIt has been awhile since I have eaten at a Hard Rock and I have never eaten at this one on the strip. \n\nThis particular visit was in June 2014.\n\nThe day was hot my friends...110+ but since I had just endured one of the coldest winters up in Canada (Temps of -50) I opted to sit on the patio...it was a good idea at first, but after about twenty minutes I was hurting and the water service was lacking.  That is the only reason for 3 stars, but it's Vegas for crying outloud and it should be just common sense to keep checking on the water even though I was drinking beers at the same time...I ended up only getting one water in all that time. \n\nThe waitress who took my order was great at taking the original orders, but the follow through was lack luster. She brought me the original beer and water that I asked for, but then I never saw her again...not even to receive the bill. \n\nAfter waiting and waiting...(there were other patrons on the patio, but I seemed to be in the twilight zone) I had to go to the bathroom. So I went. When I came back, the big guy at the door was looking at me a little sternly and then the waitress came up to me...shes like, \"Oh there you are, we thought you took off\". I was like WTF, why would they say that...you don't come to the table to check on my food, refill my water or beer and then you act like I am a dasher! \n\nNeedless to say the tip was about as stellar as the service. When I left I gave the guy a return glare. I should have talked to the manager, but I was honestly too perturbed to deal with excuses. \n\nTIP: If you want patrons to pay the bill, give them the bill, don't treat them like thieves when they go to the bathroom if you haven't given them a bill yet. \n\nIt's Vegas, and I like the food there, which was great (Burger) but there are a lot of other places to go where they may treat you a little better. Once I paid the waitress said, \"I didn't think you would just take off\" to which I wanted to reply \"I didn't think you would be such a shitty waitress\" but I didn't because...well, I didn't think of it at the time :)\n\nCheers"

She liked it and it was enough food for two people. \n\nI got the BBQ bacon cheeseburger (topped with caramelized onions, crispy bacon, and cheddar cheese). It was juicy and tasty and the BBQ sauce had a sweet, smokey flavor to it. Not bad at all. I also had a margarita with pomegranate and some other fruity flavors (don't judge me... sure I occasionally drink fruity cocktails.

He even brought out a complimentary sundae for our kid after he found out it was his birthday.\n\nThere's a huge interactive wall just past the hostess stand and there's also a touchscreen at each booth with info about memorabilia, merchandise in their store, and a voting system for the next song that's played in the restaurant. It's a great idea, but the interface is clunky. Anyone who's ever used an iphone or android will probably find it to be a little primitive. Also, there was a huge disconnect between the song that the screen indicated was playing and the music that was piped through the sound system. I don't think it listed the correct song the whole time we were there.\n\nOverall, this is a place that will attract only tourists looking for a relatively cheap, predictable meal (at least for the second floor dining area). The food was 3-star worthy, but I'm tossing in an extra star because of the good service."

I find it funny that this place is advertised on yelp under \"Canadian\" I am Canadian and the food is more American than it is Canadian, especially in portions, menu items and preparation. The food is so so, however, I'm in it for the museum aspect of it and the cool rock star casino chips that you can buy at the cash out booth. I like looking at rock memorabilia. I am a bit of a music junkie to be honest, therefore, seeing cool guitars, costumes etc is a cheap free entertainment aspect on the strip. It's not actually on the Strip but slightly on the outskirts, almost a 20 minute walk. Our waitress was friendly and the prices were decent for what it was."

Our server was great, very friendly and saved us a couple bucks by offering the bottomless drink and a refill on her margarita. We both got the pulled chicken sandwich and wow, it was SO good. I wasn't that hungry but as soon as I tasted it, it was gone in seconds. Would definitely recommend. I got the Bahama Mama bottomless drink and it was dangerously good. Couldn't taste the alcohol at all, and she got a berrygarita and she also loved it. Our drinks also came with free glasses so that was pretty neat to take home with us! I will definitely come back"

The merchandise in their \"museum\" was kinda cool but nothing to get too excited about.\n\nThe service was AWFUL. Just awful. We were seated in the middle of the room and while it was somewhat busy, we seemed to be sitting at the Invisible Table. It took forever to get menus or water. We sat and watched as all the other tables that were seated after us got service. Annoying. But we weren't angry yet.\n\nA waitress from another table came by and asked if our waitress had helped us yet. We said no and she was nice enough to get things started (menus, water). Again it took forever to put our order in. They screwed it up--we asked for mayo and they never brought it. After waiting, I flagged down a bus boy and asked him.\n\nThe entire process took over an hour and a half. I finally flagged some random waiter down and asked for our bill. \n\nWhile the food was pretty good, the service was so atrocious, I'd never return. It was a bad experience for my first time at a Hard Rock Cafe. LAME!"

The food is a bit spendy but is always good.\n\nThe restaurant is on the 2nd level of this 3-level venue.  The first level is mainly the merchandise store, and the third level is for events.  We came in for lunch and I ordered the chicken fajitas.  The dish comes out on a smoking sizzling hot plate.  Trust me, everyone in the place will \"ooh\" and \"ahhh\" as the server brings it to you, haha!  It's not the most amazing fajitas you will ever have, but it's pretty tasty.  My coworker got the twisted mac and cheese and chicken tupelos, which is a form chicken tenders but breaded with panko.  Both of these were so yummy!  Next time I go in, that's what I will have to stick to.\n\nMy company also had our holiday party at this venue on the 3rd floor.  The venue for events is absolutely perfect.  It's huge and either a band or DJ can fit on the stage.  The staff is super helpful, reliable and friendly.  We've never had any issues.  \n\nDefinitely recommended for both food and for events."

The weather was a little cooler than previous years and while it looks nice to set outside in the evening, if you are from Southern California be sure to bring a sweater.

It was full of flavor with a small side of baked beans, really good. My wife also tried something different, she got the baby arugula salad which she loved! It was huge with sliced chicken and a nice mixture of veggies. We were very happy that we tried the new items. Just a week ago we dropped in for dinner and had some room for dessert. The staff mentioned that the Banana Split was awesome so we ordered it and WOW! It was delicious! We were not expecting that, the presentation was great! Definitely the best Banana split we have had. To top it off the service at HRC is first class, from hosts, waitresses to servers all the way up to Management, I've interacted with them all and they do a really a good job of providing excellent service. Can't forget the (( MUSIC! )) Always cool watching some throwback music videos and grubbin! Hard Rock Rocks!"

It has less rock memorabilia on its walls than the HRC adjacent to the Hard Rock Hotel on Paradise, but is more elegant, plus features a dynamite second level patio overlooking other Strip properties, and a large third floor suitable for concerts.\n\nBut I was here to try the vaunted HRC hamburger, and was not let down by the 6 oz. Classic Burger with bacon and Cheddar Cheese added, and accompanying fries.  This was the small variety of burger, but it was large enough for me.  \n\nAlthough it took awhile to get made medium rare as ordered, once my sandwich arrived it was a fine burger.  Deconstructing its contents, it consisted of cold pickle chips, a good slice of ripe red tomato, green leafy lettuce, Red Onion circles, a warm charbroiled hamburger patty, a soft bready bun, very tasty bacon, and nicely melted orange Cheddar Cheese.  The fries were neither thin nor fat, and tasted just fine with the juicy Bacon Cheeseburger.  Service was friendly and professional.\n\nIt was an enjoyable lunch in a very cool setting, and I look forward to a return visit."

I think it was the best meal that we got our money while on The Strip.\n\nPros\n-Our waitress was a superstar. She was ridiculously friendly and positive, even with my gloomy Asian father. She came to check up on us at least every 10 minutes, and never let our glasses get half empty. I don't give a lot of 20% tips, but I didn't need to think twice about this one.\n-Entertainment at the table! We were seated at a booth, and attached to the wall was a touch-screen that let you could flip through musical memorabilia and look at anything from Britney Spears' waitress getup in her Crazy video to the local newspaper after Lennon's death.\n-The music, of course! I feel pretty odd commenting on this obvious aspect, but the music was loud enough for me and not too loud for my parents.\n-$4 for my Groupie Grind! Recommended to me by my waitress. Pina colada mix with mango and strawberry puree. MMMMmmmmm...Oh, for some odd reason there were no prices on the drink menu. I was surprised when I saw the check that my fabulous slushie was just $4 and my mom's fountain drink (I think she got Sierra Mist) was something like $3.50. Moral of the story: Treat yourself to a special drink!\n-Beer battered Fish n Chips. I don't even like fish, but it was so darn crispy that we all stole some of mom's food.\n\nJust OK:\n-Cobb salad. A typical and ordinary Cobb salad. Enough to fill me up, but didn't leave me feeling overstuffed. IMO, a good dish if you're not famished and you want to leave a little room to try other foods. I was also eyeing the Anti-Cobb, so maybe I'll try that next time.\n\nCons:\n-They make you take a picture with a drum set and guitars when you come in. Fun if you're going with friends, awkward when you're there with your already uncomfortable Asian parents.\n\nOverall:\nGreat service, great atmosphere, good prices and generous portions. If you're stuck on The Strip, this is one of your better options for food."

The parking situation sounded tricky - and it was. The fact that the directions provided were incorrect didn't help. Parking for the venue is in the parking garage for the Showcase Mall - and costs 3.00 (cash only) to boot. Paying for parking is unheard of on The Strip! \n\nOK - so once we find the parking lot, pay and park - the elevator dumps you out on a side street. About a block away from the entrance. We started walking toward Las Vegas Blvd. and slowly realized that all these people waiting in line were waiting to get into the venue. This is where it gets silly. \n\nIn order to get into the concert venue one needs to:\n1. Wait outside in line in the desert heat.\n2. Once you get past the first staggered security point - you're released by the security guard to walk down the public sidewalk (with everyone else that just happens to be strolling the strip unimpeded) to the entrance to the Hard Rock Store. You walk through the store - right through all the shoppers to three flights of steep stairs. All the while, there is nothing to keep random people that haven't waited in line from joining your group on the way (as one girl did - slipping into our group right behind us). So, lesson number one - only suckers wait in line...\n3. It took about 45 minutes total to get into the venue - and we arrived at posted start time. Luckily, the show started late so we didn't miss any of the show.\n\nOnce we got inside, the venue actually wasn't bad. The sound was decent and although the place holds 1100 people - it still manages to feel intimate. In keeping with Hard Rock tradition - the artifacts and historical exhibits were well done and cool. Drinks are at Strip club price - $16.00 a round for a bourbon & coke and a Miller Light.\n\nAll I can say is, I've been a musician and an avid rock show attendee for three decades now - and I'm sorry - but it's obvious to me that they built the venue with no consideration as to how a large audience would actually access the performance space on the 3rd floor. This major planning fail kind of set the tone for the night unfortunately...\n\nUPDATE: I received a few very nice messages from Hard Rock management - and they'll be working to address the entrance issues and are hoping to make this location into a premiere Las Vegas music venue.  I can't wait to see what they can work out."

Only a few minutes later Tony had my Sailor Jerry and Coke in front of me.  Staff was friendly and on the ball and the food was good and quick.  I'm definitely now a fan and will hit the place up again next time I'm in town.  Kudos for actually having Sailor Jerry as most of the places on the strip have drank the Captain Morgan kool-aide."

However, I have been to the 3rd floor on a couple of occasions for special events, and I dig the clean, modern space. Plus, the floor to ceiling windows provide a breathtaking Vegas view if views of Vegas are your thing. It's weird because the building is not tall, but somehow the size of the windows creates a panorama that is impressive in its own way. The staff has always been helpful, and today, I got to sample some of the appetizer fare served buffet style, perhaps not doing it justice, but it was okay. Still, I am a fan. I would recommend at least grabbing a drink here, although I am not sure if the 3rd floor is normally open. In that case, find someone with a budget and host a party here! It's a great venue."

This place brings me back to the days in high school when it was so cool to be seen wearing a HRC t-shirt.  Of course, growing up in WNY, Orlando is the most popular place that families seem to vacation, .... so it seemed that almost everyone owned an Orlando HRC T-shirt. And boxer shorts. We were so cool.\n\nBut not my BFF. She scored a Las Vegas one, and I was secretly jealous.\n\nFifteen plus years later, and I had to have lunch here for memory's sake. The restaurant is rather large, and was pretty crowded for a late Saturday afternoon. A friend and I scored bar seats, and within a minute or two had the bartenders attention. The holiday drink menu looked intriguing, but when I asked his recommendation, he said he wasn't too impressed and could make me a fantastic raspberry martini, after a few questions as to what type of drinks I enjoyed. It was delish.\n\nOur entrees (pulled pork and chix mac & cheese) were delivered rather quickly. Sizeable, yet manageable portions, and very tasty.\n\nOverall a very positive experience. Enjoyed chatting with our bartender about the local MTB scene, and will have to return for another matini. Will probably not be purchasing any more T-shirts though. The coolness factor has worn off."

Our server was polite, but after ordering it took an hour to get our food.  I ordered the brisket sandwich.  The first bite was all fat, turned out the entire sandwich was all fat, and inedible.  My father in law order chicken nachos, no tomatoes (he can't eat them).  They came covered with tomatoes so he sent them back for the beef nachos, again stated no tomatoes to the same server.  When he finally got them, surprise, more tomatoes.  Combine that with messed up orders and undercooked burgers for the rest of our party, and we were pretty unhappy.  The server brought over the manager, Tim or Ted or something (medium build white guy with a shaved head).  At the table he was all \"right, of course, of course, I understand.\". And offered us deserts on the houseto make up ffor the issues, so we ordered desert to try and salvage the experience.  He also promised to take the messed up items off the menu.  When we got the bill we found out they had charged us for everything, including the complimentary deserts, and took a flat $100 off the bill (original total of about $250).  When I confronted the manager one on one about the bill (the deserts we were charged for, and the flat $100,taken off), he became confrontational and said it wasn't his job to go through the check item by item and take things off.  When I offered to sit down with him and do it for him, he said \"if you want to go through item by item and argue over 14 cents, that's up to you.\". He then assured me there was no one above him to speak to and walked off.  We paid our bill because we are not the type to walk out on a check, and our server got a $10 pitty tip.  I will never go back there, especially with guests from out of town, and I will never recommend it to anyone.  Please save your time and money and go elsewhere."

She handed me a guitar, we struck some rockstar poses while she snapped a couple shots. Then it was off to get seated.   Our hostess was friendly and tried to make small talk while she took us to our table. The eating area of the Hard Rock Cafe was almost identical to the club area, which is one floor up. The only differences I saw were the additional tables, and different memorabilia. \n\nOur waitress was friendly and we were able to place orders for drinks quickly after being seated. My husband decided to order the pulled pork and ribs combo plate, I had a sirloin steak. When we ordered, the waitress gave him a choice in the sauces for the pulled pork, he went with vinegar.\n\nAfter placing our food order, someone came by with the photo that had been taken when we entered. $20 later we had a 5x7 in a simple, touristy frame and 2 smaller photos. Pretty gimmicky but a nice way to remember the evening.\n\nFood was brought out promptly. Not too fast but fast enough. I tried a little of the pulled pork, I was glad my husband went with the vinegar based sauce. Very tasty. He seemed to really enjoy the ribs as well.  My steak was fine, nothing exceptional.  I really did like that it was served with snap peas though. \n\nOverall, a better experience then my first visit. Food was  good, a little on the pricier side but nothing we weren't expecting. Not really a place I think I'd feel the urge to return to often though. Maybe when people visit from out of town..."

Wait during the time I went [about 12:00PM] was 15-20 minutes, not too bad. My partner and I decided to have a few drinks at the bar as we waited for our number to be called for our table. We sat at the bar top on the 2nd floor and was greeted by Lauren, who said she would be with us in a moment. She then attended the party next to us and began to go into this loooooong conversation about horrible customer service she had received at some restaurant with the group of girls. I waited 5 minutes, that then turned into 10 minutes, going near 15 minutes as she continued her rant about her horrible restaurant experience. Not once did she make eye-contact nor come and get my drink order as I sat there. It wasn't until this angel sent from the gates of heaven came and asked for my drink order. Her name was Liz and she was great. She wasn't responsible for tending that side of the bar but did notice her co-worker talking away. She took the initiative and came and asked for my drink order plus the other 5 customers who were also waiting for Lauren to stop the yapping. Drinks were served quickly but couldn't enjoy a drink at the bar as my table was ready. I ended up closing out, and having to take the bar drinks to the table. Food was ok, drinks were ok [not too strong], and service was ok. What saved me from rating this any lower was liz, she was great and really appreciated her customer services. She had a great attitude and made sure my partner and I were happy. And to Lauren, she needs to tend the paying customers and cut the convos to a minimum, especially when you see a full bar of people who needs refills or place an order."

Math has never been my best subject, but I am going to say that's a solid 4. \n\nHonestly, I normally wouldn't come to a chain in Vegas.... but this was the Yelp Spring Break headquarters and we were enticed by the $10 lunch menu for us. Since we were checking in here anyway, we decided to check it out. \n\n- Hickory Smoked Pork Belly Sliders - They were decent, but the bread/filling ratio was off and I thought the pork was much much too sweet. Still tasty though. \n- Braised Short Rib Tacos - My favorite! Great combination of flavors, perfect short ribs, and the dipping sauces were a great match. \n- Nacho Mama Fried Jalapenos - We were warned they would be spicy, but they were overwhelmingly so! I loved the crispiness and the way they were loaded with cream cheese, but I can usually handle spicy and couldn't handle much more than a few bites of these. \n- Twisted Mac and Cheese - This wasn't on the Yelp menu, but who can resist mac and cheese? This one was a little different, with buffalo sauce added (which I wouldn't have been able to tell, had we not been told). It gave it an extra interesting little kick, and the dish was creamy, cheesy, and gooey, they way it should be. \n\nThe dishes were more tapas style/samplers than the lunch specials advertised, but it was still cool to check out a place that none of us had been to. The free drink tickets from Yelp made it more than worthwhile too.... our Bacardi Torched Cherry cocktails were refreshing and strong. \n\nMichael was personable, hilarious, and enthusiastic. He really wanted us to enjoy our whole experience there, and he was beyond great. He gave some great drink recommendations to my drinking-partner-and-crime and I: their version of a Long Island and another SoCo-based sweet drink. Both highly recommended. \n\nWould I come back? Hard Rock was an excellent sponsor and host for our event, and a great atmosphere to get the party started. The fantastic service would bring me back, and also my discovery of the patio...... the front of the dining area is a huge, shaded patio with a view of the whole Strip and Bellagio fountains. Great place to grab some drinks and get into the Vegas spirit."

Booth seats feel better on my husbands legs.  So this blond gal takes us to a regular table and removes a chair.  She says, roll him here.  There was a whole wall full of empty booths near the doors where the food comes out. I said can't we just have one of these, she turns silent and starts mumbling into her walkie talkie, I said again, can we sit here, she's still ignoring me talking in to that damn thing.  Then she just points to the booth and walks away. So we literally sit there for no less than 10 min until the savior of the experience shows up and says \"are you guys being helped\"  I said NO.  She said \"don't worry guys, I'll take care of you\"  and she meant it, she didn't miss a beat.  I wish I got her name, she was the coolest.  She had brown/reddish hair up in a bun, We both had the Hard Rock Club sandwich and it was great.  She turned the whole experience around for us because we were just about to leave seconds before she came to us.  The other annoyance was this skinny black bald guy who was playing up the whole \"bro\" thing too thick to his coworkers and cussing every time he passed us by.  Fuckin fuckin fuck bro fuck fuck bro is all we heard from him. A for our waitress, hugz to you."

My friend Karen has not been to Las Vegas for over three years, so I took her to the Hard Rock Cafe to check out the casino and the caf\u00e9.\n\nThere's 2 Hard Rock Cafe's in Las Vegas, one on the strip (but it's a franchise), and the original corporate one is this one off Paradise Rd, diagonally from the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus. The caf\u00e9 is not connected to the casino or hotel. Even the parking lot is not connected but has its own separate area.\n\nKaren wanted a shot glass and the caf\u00e9 had a bunch, including a limited-edition one. That's when we found out the caf\u00e9 on the strip was not a corporate owned store. The one on the strip does not have the same merchandise as this location. Like all the other Hard Rock Cafe is, there's tons of music memorabilia post it all over the restaurant. When you walk in, you'll find Life-size mannequins of KISS. \n\nThe gift shop is pretty large, and the one guy who helped us was pretty friendly. He even signed up Karen for their frequent reward program.  Overall a good experience, except when you're at the parking lot, there's a lot of homeless people which gave me the creeps. The Hard Rock Cafe staff member said there's a water channel located nearby, and that's where the homeless people live."

Anyway, Las Vegas has a really great selection of pins that represent the city well, which is an important element for me when I choose pins for my collection. \n\nThe gentleman at the shop was fantastic. He brought the pins out of the case for easy viewing (you'd be surprised how few people offer this to you) and had a slew of knowledge regarding the pins I pointed out. He mentioned if they were limited edition, its background story, etc. He also asked if I was enrolled in the rewards program and it turns out I was not. I couldn't believe after multiple visits to different HRCs, no one asked me to enroll. Then, he informed me that they offer a locals discount of 15% (F&B and merchandise)! He was extremely thorough and offered a wonderful shopping experience. Kudos!"

My friend doesn't like onion rings, so they allowed us to sub french fries, which was nice. Everything was just ok, nothing special. The only thing that was wholly awful were the chicken wings - not only were they cold, they were rubbery and just plain gross. We got bbq because my friend can't eat spicy and they were still spicy. They were just weird and we didn't even eat them. We also had the brownie sundae which is $10 which we thought was outrageous until we saw the size of the thing. It was HUGE. Like bigger than my head. You need like a football team to eat the thing. Four of us still only ate like a third of it. Wow it was big. \n\nOur server was very nice, I don't remember her name but she was pretty fast and attentive. Only thing she ever forgot was a twisted lemonade that I had to remind her about but once I did she grabbed it right away!\n\nOverall an ok place, wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way to eat here but definitely come for the drinks and the music!

Maybe I was extremely hungry but those nachos were simply delish! The cheese was yummy, chips with a perfect crunch! LOL. Here comes the sad news, the shrimp that came with the fajitas were really good but the fajitas beside them self were super subpar.  I'd try it, maybe get a salad with shrimp and shake or something if theres a next time! :) The customer service was really nice though!"

Today I had a NY strip steak meal. It was really good.  Good cut of steak, cooked to perfection and nicely seasoned.  I've always enjoyed the staff here.  And I love the music they play and watching the music videos on big screen.  A fun place to visit overall.  Keep in mind that it's not 5-star dining but food is tasty and a fun experience.  Oh, if you go during a dead time, like during working hours, you can park right behind the cafe and take shuttle in front of Hard Rock Cafe or Hard Rock Hotel to the strip if you want---very convenient. AND IF YOU CHECK-IN ON YELP, A COUPON FOR 20% off food only will appear on your phone and show it to your waiter.  So my meal was really $22-ish instead of $27.  I added a side-salad for $3.50 --- healthy portions."

I mean you had to have the t shirt from any of 10 cities to show how cool you were. Fast forward to today, and I don't think I have sen anyone in a hardrock caf\u00e9 t shirt in at least 10 years. Crazy stuff truth be told. The swag here is the same as every other hard rock caf\u00e9 worldwide, it just says lost wages on it instead of Albuquerque, Sydney, or London. \n\nPro Tip: Yelp check in for 20% off of your check not including alcohol.\n\nI got a burger that was fairly average when I was here. It didn't stand out and make me go wow or think anything specific. To go with it I got french fried potatoes and topped them with cheese and BACON! Sadly it cost me an extra $2.50 for the cheese and bacon O_O   I was totally caught off guard by that. Especially when it was one strip of bacon crumbled and one slice of American cheese. Not exactly a great bang for your buck.\n\nOne of my friends had a salad which was purportedly decent. It came with a number of toppings and I bet the total calorie count was more than my burger and fries =X My other two friends there split a meal which they seemed to enjoy but weren't very excited about and I cant remember what they ordered haha.\n\nDrinks were decent pours but that is expected in Vegas IMHO. Several hurricanes were delivered to our table and the girls enjoyed them and got them with the souvenir glasses.\n\nOverall it was acceptable food but a bit pricey for what we received IMHO. The brand is not worth the extra cost at this point in time and it was an average meal with averagish service and bygone swag... so enjoy it if you go but don't expect much..."

We waited 15 minutes without drinks, the server offer to bring us more drinks after I stare her for like 5 minutes and she shouted from the bar if we wanted anything else.

More on that later.\n\nI decided to have dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe one night because I had one tickets to a concert at the Joint, inside the hotel/casino. As a fan of rock music, I'd been wanting to eat in this place for a long time. \n\nThe first thing I noticed upon arrival - shitty parking. There were HARDLY ANY SPACES, over half of which were blocked off for valet use only. I looked all around for a place to park - none whatsoever. The guy at the valet booth gave me directions to a garage, but I never found or saw it. The only garage I was able to find was for Hard Rock employees only. I finally had to park in a lot across the street. This story continues later in the review. \n\nThe restaurant itself is jam-packed with memorabilia. What Planet Hollywood is for movies, this place is for rock music. Memorabilia from every popular rock band you can possibly imagine is in here. Not to mention they sell plenty of items in their gift shop. It's a music lover's paradise. \n\nThe food was very good. Not the best cuisine I've had in the Vegas Valley, but it was certainly good. Definitely better than I would have expected for a restaurant like this that focuses more on its gimmick than its food, although my girlfriend's mashed potatoes did taste like they came out of a TV dinner. Other than that, all the food was fine.\n\nRemember the parking situation I talked about before? It gets worse. When I returned to my car, I found a big \"violation\" tag on it, and a boot. I HAD TO PAY A $200 FINE TO HAVE IT REMOVED. In other words, I had to pay more money to have this thing removed than I would have paid if I had BOUGHT the concert tickets I had won. Why should I have to suffer because the Hard Rock can't provide adequate parking to its customers? Seriously and literally, I parked in the ONLY PLACE I COULD FIND, and was made to suffer for it.\n\nAnd just a heads up - If you buy a souvenir glass in the restaurant, they WILL NOT LET YOU TAKE IT IN THE CONCERT VENUE. This is utter bullshit, considering it was merchandise from THEIR FACILITY, and it is a SITTING venue (this isn't a raucous \"standing room only\" venue!) So I had to walk all the way to the coat check booth to deposit it during the show. \n\nThe Hard Rock Cafe is a great place for music lovers, but do yourself a favor and take a cab there. The parking is THAT bad. And don't even think about parking across the street unless you want to pay a hefty fine."

I recall getting a macaroni and cheese that came with some type of toast or garlic bread.

It's okay though, he's working in the Hard Rock Cafe, I win the moral victory.\n\nAnywho, the food was okay, though the portions felt a little on the drab/small side. The fries were excellent, but the Mojito I had was probably the worst I've ever had. What did they use, Domino and tap water? Nevertheless, the guy took it off my bill, after I made a face like I'd tasted bum.\n\nOverall, this place is way too out of the way as far as the strip goes to be worth it, and price/selection wise really isn't going to blow anyone away. And no I will not ramble at length about the memorabilia - even the Baltimore branch was more impressive. \n\nTake the family though, it's a great place for children.

To make things more confusing, this Hard Rock is NOT in the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, but is a separate structure in front of it (and surrounded by the Hotel's driveway).  Got it?  \n\nOk, now that we know where we are, let's go in.  The decor is typical of every Hard Rock there is: rock memorabilia (mostly guitars) mounted on the walls with plaques identifying the musician who once used it, and many TV's featuring rock videos.  It felt fresh and exciting in New York in the 1980's; now it seems tame and stale.  Maybe that's why I was the only patron who was not 1) elderly, or 2) dining with small children.  \n\nI was greeted promptly and cheerfully by the hosts, and they offered me a seat at the bar, which I took.  I had slept in too late and so I missed the bacon egg and cheese croissant I had been craving (breakfast ends at 11 AM).  Instead I decided to go safe and order the Legendary Burger.  \n\nMy bartender also had tables he was in charge of serving, so he was gone a lot.  Watching him work, he had a tendency to get task-saturated: he would keep running back and forth to whatever table had asked him for something last, rather than taking care of multiple parties in sweeps.  I finally just went to the server station and had him refill my drink from the soda gun.  \n\nThe food was fine.  Nothing spectacular, but not bad, either.  The price seemed a little steep, but 1) this is a tourist-trap, and 2) check in with Yelp yields a 20% discount on food and non-alcoholic drinks, so that was nice.  \n\nConclusions: this place is fine; neither great nor terrible."

            "review": "Well I want to start by saying my rating for this restaurant is misleading. The only reason I gave this poor excuse for a restaurant the one star I did is because this app requires me to do so. I am not the least bit picky when it comes to restaurants and normally have a great deal of patience for the staff as I understand their jobs are difficult, fast-paced and demanding. Despite this attitude, I was nothing short of extremely disappointed with my experience at this location. Although the restaurant was nearly empty at lunchtime, the service was extraordinarily slow and we were greeted with an attitude reflective of a staff that was filled with bitterness and broken dreams. Even the simplest requests caused our waiter Rico (yes I wrote his name in the hope that there is not even a remote possibility of him escaping responsibility for this poor review) to treat us as if we were a burden on par with the bubonic plague. He refused to make the slightest adjustments to the menu despite our friend's preference to not have coleslaw with his meal. Splitting our check (a common practice in the age of debit cards) was seen as an insurmountable obstacle that clearly irritated Rico. I asked for a glass of water and Rico answered me in a hostile manner indicating he had already brought me some. I proceeded to correct him by informing him that the water belonged to my friend. Approximately 10 minutes later he returned with my water and slammed it on my table without so much as another word. Our food finally arrived nearly an hour after we ordered it and while the taste was passable in my eyes, nearly the rest of my party was thoroughly disappointed with the food we had wasted our valuable vacation time waiting on. So if after all this ranting you are still not convinced that the service here is not so poor that it should be reprehensible by law, at least ask not to be served by a stocky waiter with dark curly hair, a goatee, and a beanie who goes by the name of Rico. If you are asked for the reasoning behind this particular request, show the manager this review."

I chose the \"Smothered Fries\" which had bacon and cheese on them. They were OK.\n\nMy man had the \"10oz Burger\" and he said the burger didn't have much flavor as well. The cost for that was $$15.75 and they charged $3.75 for a side on \"Onion Rings\" with it. Way too much money.\n\nWe decided to split a dessert and got the \"Mini Peanut Butter Pie\" and that cost $4.25. I have to say this was the best part of the meal.\n\nOne perk is that if you have a Nevada ID you get 15% off your bill which is cool but when the food isn't so tasty that doesn't seem like much of a perk."

Our waiter was sub-par and not very attentive to us, or nice for that matter and there was this really loud and obnoxious blonde waitress's that kept yelling and singing very badly to the music. She didn't even know the words. Very annoying. Just cause it wasn't that busy doesn't mean there aren't customers here.

However, when I receive excellent customer service somewhere, I have to alert the masses!   My parents were here from MA and my dad just HAD to get a Hard Rock Cafe - Las Vegas Shirt.  The gift shop is well set up and the girl working the counter was AWESOME.  Super friendly and accommodating.  She built a solid rapport and completed the transaction with a smile.  I know, doesnt sound like it was out of the ordinary, however, I can be a tad snobbish with the trendy younger crowd places.  I have ran into too many people at these places that are too cool for their job.  But she did a wonderful job"

I love peanut butter, don't get me wrong, but this was lacking another flavor. It tasted like I dipped my spoon in a jar of smooth peanut butter.

Warily I agreed.   After arriving my friend seemed stunned by the prices and the lack of a locals discount or the specials he thought they had.   To this day I'm not sure if he made those up or was at a different place entirely that he was thinking of.   Never fear, the yelp app was here to save the day!   Check in and you get 20% off.   I love you Yelp app.  \n\nStarted with some Jameson and Ginger and they were okay.   For $9 not much value, but I've definitely had worse.   Went with the \"Local Legendary\" burger which differs by location and oddly enough you have to ask the server what it consists of as the Hard Rock apparently is too cheap to have each location have their own menu.    Ours had some fried jalapenos and spicy something or other which was enough for me to try it.   I see someone else in these reviews mentioned their local legendary burger had a fried egg.  Mine did not.   I'm now convinced the \"Local Legendary\" burger is just something either the waiter or cook invents in their own head that day.   Well our waiter sold me on this one.   Speaking of which, our waiter was a joy the entire time.   Friendly, efficient, and with a great sense of humor.   If it wasn't for the last round of Jameson shots I'd probably be able to tell you his name.  He kinda reminded me of Questlove from the Roots if that helps.\n\nOnto the burger:  Pretty run of the mill.   I ordered it medium and I feel like it came out well done.   Very charred and with very little pink inside.  Wish I'd gone with medium rare as I normally do, but then I hate when it comes out rare.   Such a delicate game the burger ordering process.   I also didn't feel it had enough seasoning to overcome the wellness of the cook on it, but the jalapenos, cheese, and whatever sauce it was slathered with all were tasty enough to conceal the meat flavor.   Fries were hot and crispy with a nice flavor, but nothing to really differentiate themselves from any other fry.   \n\nOverall on food I'd probably go a 2.5, with the great service and 20% yelp discount bumping it up to a 3. \n\nI've come to find out through other reviews that the locals discount is a measly 15% vs the 20% yelp discount.   Go technology!   Next time I expect a 40% discount if paying by bitcoin."

Something isn't right about that... I've eaten here before and had the burgers, they are good but c'mon! I was recently at the Hard Rock in Pittsburgh and the prices were FAR more reasonable. We ended up ordering one root beer ($3.99 + tax & tip- but oh, not one refill was given..) And one domestic beer in a bottle. We decided to leave it at that and ended up eating down the street at P.F Cheng's (which was fabulous, by the way).\n\nPerhaps the drastically overpriced menu has gnawed at the customer base that kept it thriving for years.\n\nMaybe it's time for Hard Rock Las Vegas to take a look in the mirror, realize why customers aren't coming in, and do something about it while they still can. And stop playing horrible 80's songs and rap! Its Hard ROCK!!"

I failed to inform the server of my preference when I placed my order, so that was my fault. To be clear, the chicken was NOT under-cooked, I am just picky. However, they could tell something was wrong and I protested that everything was fine, but they continued to ask. Finally I broke down and explained. They offered to fix it but I was already full (the fries are killer). Nevertheless they took the meal off the bill and the manager came over to tell us personally. I really would have paid for the meal and not complained, but they wouldn't let me pay for something I didn't enjoy. My lunch buddy wanted the black and bleu burger, which is no longer on the menu, and they made it special for her. She loved it. You can't ask for better customer service than we received today. AND they offer a 15% locals discount. Even though I live in town and work just a few minutes away, I had never been here before today, but I will definitely be coming back."

They have a mystery mojito, don't get it.  It has way to much of a cucumber flavor which ruins it.   The artichoke flatbread dip was good but you run out of flat bread before your done with the dip.

They make a good avocado and pepperjack burger, however the steak fries were a bit underfried and very salty. Hard Rock has some nice tunes and rock memorabilia strewn across the walls, they also have a gift shop where you can another Hard Rock shirt for future painting days."

The friends we dined with said the same comment, average food. Nothing to write home about. Our servers Kyle and Big Deb did give us Good service. We attend a monthly car event there so we want to patronize the business, but next time we will eat before we get there. On average plan to spend at least $33.00 for a dinner for 2 not including tip.

She got the job done and even found time to joke around and be personal. I was at a table of 15 so she was amazing. \n\nI was so happy when I remembered to check in and was greeted with 20% off from using the yelp app. It only works on food but still an awesome surprise. \n\nI had the mushroom and Swiss burger. It was cooked perfectly but I found it to be a little greasy.  I also had a pineapple & cocoanut mojito to drink.  That was the highlight.  That ended up being nearly the same price as my meal $12.50. Also there are no prices on the menu for the drinks.  The only reason this place doesn't get 4 stars was because it was pricey. Even with my discount I still ended up spending over $33 bucks on just myself!  Crazy."

There's a bar right in the middle with a number of small and medium sized tv's, notice how I didn't say big or large tv's. The customer service was pretty good too as they were accommodating to our party, friendly, and brought everything, food, drinks, check in a timely manner. And of course they had no problem taking the 20% off per Yelp check-in offer.\n\nFor the food, a lot of what we ordered was decent at most. First up was the jumbo combo which was basically a sampler of their various apps it had some wings, chicken tenders, onion rings, artichoke dip, parmesan flatbread and bruschetta, and a few dipping sauces. It was a nice start for a party of 5 and of course I got a little full eatting everything no one else didn't want. The platter was alright only thing I didn't like was the flatbread and bruschetta cause it was hard and messy to eat I might've even chipped a few teeth.\n\nNext came what I ordered the bbq brisket sandwich. It was plenty filling just dry and tough. Maybe the bread took some of the moisture. It didn't come with any kind of sauce which could've maybe helped, maybe. Also came with fries and beans.\n\nThe bbq trio was bbq chicken, ribs, and brisket. Good portion but everything was very dry. Funny cause I think I read that it was supposed to be tender.\n\nWe never made it to the desserts but everything looked tempting. Probably would be back.\n\nThey also have their own parking so you don't have to park at the hotel and walk over."

One fork in particular had a big strand of what looked like wilted lettuce caked on to it. Although all were replaced promptly, this silverware should have never made it to the table: lack of attention to detail and lack of care. Also makes one wonder of the condition of the back kitchen.\n\nService: Ronnie was awesome and very friendly\n\nFood: I had the fajitas. The meat was cooked fine, but the veggies were mostly undercooked, which just seemed lazy to me. My company had a BBQ sandwich which was good. The other had the boneless spicy chicken which was fine.\n\nShop: the clerk at the shop didn't seem to care that we were there or not. Usually they are a lot more friendly and engaging.\n\nSummary: I really enjoy the Hard Rock, but today's visit was below my expectations, and I sensed an overall lack of attention to cleanliness/detail/care."
