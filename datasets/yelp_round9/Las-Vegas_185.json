            "review": "Is it bad if you go to a restaurant in Vegas that you've been to elsewhere? I don't care. My sister and I went here for an incredible dinner. The service was fantastic. We were seated next to the window so we got to watch the fountains the entire night (contrary to what you might expect I did not get bored watching them over and over again). We started with the polenta w/mushrooms because I love it, the yellowtail, which was delicious and super fresh, and the scallops which were awesome. My sister had the infamous spaghetti which she loved (and I did too). My dish was out of control - it is called the black macaroni and if I could eat it all the time I would. It is squid ink pasta (not macaroni) with lobster and BASIL BREAD CRUMBS. I cannot describe how perfect this dish is - or how obsessed I now am with basil bread crumbs. Truly amazing. We got the zeppole for dessert. *Love* - truly excellent and wonderful - I wasn't expecting this level of awesome. I need to go to the one in nyc now so I can have the trifecta."

(All the tables that actually had front view of the Bellagio water show could've cared less about the water show!) The view really is amazing. The ambiance is nice and romantic, with Justin Timberlake singing in the background. The bread baskets were as delicious as everyone mentioned, and if you ask they do give another basket. Ordered the spaghetti because everyone mentioned how great it was -- it was yummy but not sure $24 yummy. Ordered a bottle of wine which was a task because they had so many options! Service was great and it was a nice fine dining experience."

            "review": "I am a fan of Scott Conant from Chopped fame but I have to say the Las Vegas outpost of his iconic NYC restaurant just did not live up to the hype.  I went with a group of guys and we ordered the tasting menu.  They were nice enough to allow us to order it on a Friday night since it is usually not offered on that night of the week.  We tasted 8 dishes for $110 pp.  The quantity of food was great - really full at the end of the meal - but most of the dishes were just ok.\n\nThe real highlight for me was the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms.  Wow, that was delicious.  Probably the creamiest polenta I've ever had and it paired so nicely with the earthiness of the truffles and mushrooms.   The chocolate cake served for the dessert course was also terrific, served with toasted almond gelato.  Too bad I was so full by that time I could only have a couple of bites.  Nothing else was particularly memorable.  \n\nDisappointing for me was the restaurant's signature spaghetti - a seemingly simple preparation of pasta, fresh tomatoes and basil.  It arrived very simply plated -  a perfect cylinder mold of spaghetti covered by a clear plastic cloche that I suppose is meant to preserve the freshness of the preparation or perhaps to concentrate the aroma.  The cloches are removed with a flourish releasing nice smells of tomato and basil.  The pasta was a bit overcooked and the sauce, while wonderfully creamy (how do they do that?) was just too sweet, as if Chef Conant and Chef Boyardee had a bastard love-child.\n\nAnother disappointment was the black cod.  In the past I have found this fish to be among the most delicious owing to its high fat content and buttery texture and flavor.  Scarpetta's rendition of this fish, pan-roasted with concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel, was so overcooked that it was unrecognizable as black cod.  Just a piece of fish.\n\nOther dishes were a bit more successful including the raw preparation of yellowtail and tuna, the diver scallops, the short rib/bone marrow agnolotti and the duck breast.\n\nThe wine list is voluminous and expensive.  The cocktail menu offers some nice selections.\n\nThere is certainly a lot of eye candy to be enjoyed at this swank place in the Cosmo.  However, one annoying thing was the lighting.  Over every table there is a large fixture containing multiple yellow/gold colored lights.  This lighting casts the food in a weird color and makes taking pictures of the food impossible.  All the food looks bad in the pictures I took - I suppose that's no surprise that the pictures were a disappointment too."

(for next time).\n\nbread:\ninsert triple toe curl for the bread selection and i'm not a gluten freak.  i would make out with the pastry chef just for the bread alone.\n\nappetizers and entrees:\n- the bride to be was in bliss with her veal duo.\n- i loved my foie gras pasta - it was not salty like other yelpers have mentioned. and i'm sodium sensitive.\n- every gal pretty much loved their dish from short rib to lobster pasta.\n- the only mini ding was that the calamari was way too spicy for my liking.\n\nwine list is lovely and affordable for vegas.  \n\nwe would have stayed longer for more foodie adventures but our  group had more stops to make that night.  scarpetta is a solid date night spot or whenever you want to be pampered.\n\ntip: the lighting is kind on the eyes.  no botox required."

Service was friendly and great. However, the bar does not get a view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nHighly recommend the Il Limone cocktail and the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti. We would go back there just for the agnolotti. \n\nThe Duck and Foie ravioli, while well made, felt like a let down compared to the agnolotti. The foie, rather than adding buttery richness to the ravioli, accentuated the gamey-ness and tasted more like regular liver. \n\nWe also got the Arancini and the Fritto Misto. The arancini was pretty standard. The fritto misto comes out as a pile of thinly sliced fried vegetables on some small bits of assorted fried seafood. There was a tiny subtle pleasant kick to the fritto misto that also added to the uniqueness of the dish."

From start to finish, from the service to the food to the view, there was nothing anyone at our table could say negatively about Scarpetta.\n\nI had the Black Cod which is apparently becoming very chic now.  It was so light and buttery that I only wish I could have had more.  It almost melts in your mouth.  \n\nGoing as a group was beneficial because we were able to try several of the pasta dishes and share.  I'm not sure the pastas are enough as an individual entree but probably too much for an individual appetizer...if that makes sense.  They are perfect for sharing.  We went with the short rip agnolotti, traditional spaghetti, and duck foie gras ravioli.  All were awesome, even the spaghetti which was a surprise to those at the table doubting a typical or plain type of pasta was worth a try.\n\nI would also highly recommend the lamb, at least 3 people at our table got it so I was lucky enough to have a bite or two.  It was perfectly cook on every plate and was so tender it was definitely a star of the menu."

            "review": "Came on a Wednesday evening, May 9, 2012.\n\nCatching up on writing reviews, and I wish I could have forgotten about this terrible experience already.\n\nOur party of 4 approached the hostess and politely asked for a table.  She looks up... no smile.  We're told the wait is about 15 minutes, and we reply it's not a problem, asking if it's ok to sit at one of the many empty seats/booths across the bar near the entrance.  She pauses before answering that it's ok (and only later do I sense that her response was a bit cold).\n\nHowever, I'm still in high spirits from having arrived in Vegas that evening for extended weekend of friends and partying.  As we're led into the dining room, I marvel at the coziness.  The room is quite small, with what seemed like 3 rows of tables, with the window seats overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  It's more intimate than I expected, and I immediately filed the memory as a good place to bring a date.\n\nWe're led to a circular, chic booth that had, in hindsight, almost a diner-like feel to it... but it was an upscale setting, and was something I actually enjoyed so we could eat family style.\n\nWe had chosen to dine here because Arvin T had heard they had an amazing spaghetti.  But let's continue chronologically.  The bread basket came out, and it was amazing.  The stromboli was tasty, though I'm no expert, and we ended up asking them for a second basket.  The waiter was slow in bringing that second basket out, and I definitely felt like we committed a taboo... but that didn't stop us from reminding him to bring that out for us.\n\nI'd go down a play-by-play for each of the items on the menu, but, to be honest, it wasn't very impressive.  I really hoped the food was so good that I could look past the mediocre service, which bordered on indifferent.  But, alas, it cannot be said.\n\nI would still recommend this place to bring your date for a nice, intimate dinner.  The dim yellow lighting exuded a warmth that I only wished was completed by quality service I had come to expect from the Cosmo...  If service isn't important to you, esp in relation to money spent, then I would still suggest giving this place a go sometime.\n\nHowever, I think of Vegas as a place to escape - a sanctuary away from the hustles of life.  Scarpetta let me down, and it was only the first punch in the stomach by Cosmo that night."

            "review": "I was slightly disappointed with the food here.  From all the reviews I read, I thought that the pasta here was going to be exceptional. First off, let me state that the waiter I had was absolutely great and the view of the Bellagio and the fountains was fantastic as well.\n\nSince none of the appetizers sounded appealing to me, I decided to order two pasta dishes.  I first ordered the spaghetti.  On the menu, it simply states \"Spaghettti-tomato and basil.\"  As I started eating it, I realized that it was actually spicy and felt my lips burning.  Given that this is their signature dish, I expected to be blown away and I was not.  I feel that if the food is going to be spicy, they should let you know-this spaghetti certainly had more to it than simply tomato and basil.\n\nThe next dish I had was the Stracci-which was their seafood pasta dish that on the night I was there included crab, shrimp, and lobster.  The seafood was laid out on top of thin ribbons of black and yellow pasta.  While the seafood was tasty, I thought the dish was somewhat unimaginative.\n\nBetween these two pasta dishes and the bread that came out, which was fantastic, I was full and had to skip dessert.\n\nWould I go back to Scarpetta?  Probably not, especially when considering there are so many fine restaurants in Las Vegas and the fact that with tax and tip, I spent close to $90 just for one person.  At the end of the day, I thought that the food was good but I just expected a bit more."

First the service here is impeccable, the staff is on point and very knowledgeable of the menu. The atmosphere is amazing, very romantic for dates and great views on the Bellagio fountains. Now to the food... got the beef tar tar, squid and baby octopus and heir loom tomato salad to start; all were delicious, the beef tar tar was amazing with the egg yoke Mmmmm getting hungry writing this review. The heir loom tomato salad with baratta cheese oh my goodness, the flavors accentuate each other complimenting one another without overpowering one another. The squid and baby octopus was so flavorful, cooked to perfection; not chewy very tender. Now to the main course which is a big part of why my rating was so low, got the duck foie gras ravioli and the Fettuccine with lamb ragu and broccoli rab. I don't know what went wrong but my ravioli with the foie gras was so over whelming that it was hard to finish the plate, needs something to balance out the flavors. the pasta itself had no flavor (probably not salted) now to the fettuccine with lamb, which was well just fettuccine with lamb nothing special, not much flavor either and nothing special. Maybe its the location the waiter said scott doesn't come here often so maybe he needs to swing by and check up on this place but overall not impressed and ill stick to eating at the one in beverly hills"

Value was a 3 because although the meal was decent, we had read so many excellent reviews and this restaurant came highly recommended by peers from work, yet the food didn't blow us away. We ate recently in Napa at Bottega and paid the same amount ~ $125 for the meal and neither of us could stop talking about that meal. At Scarpetta, the $125 was expensive for the food. We shared the Burrata salad, which was delicious. - I recommend it. I had the turkey dinner special (a Thanksgiving special item) it was good, but the taste was average. She had the lamb and we thought the turkey was better. No dessert. \n\nWine selection was excellent. I'd recommend the restaurant but wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again."

My co-worker and I were seated by the window with an amazing view of the Bellagio water show. Fabulous! But more importantly, the food was delicious! Everything from the cocktails to the bread basket was wonderful. We ordered the berry smash cocktails (perfect and not too sweet!), scallops, heirloom tomato salad, spaghetti (simple yet amazing), short rib ravioli and the best dessert on the planet, the cinnamon sugar donuts with warm nutella in the middle and caramelized bananas on the side (are they for real?!?). \n\nBottom line, if you're in town you MUST go to Scarpetta.

We were greeted at the door and congratulated by the host, which was very nice. \n\nWe were then escorted to the worst table in the house: a wobbly 4 top table in between 4 large parties of business men, where we couldn't hear each other talk. We were also given nasty looks when we asked for a booth away from the crowd seating. \n\nThe food overall was 4 stars. The spaghetti and lobster picci were cooked al dente and were enjoyable, with perfect portions. The added meatballs were $8 for tiny bits over over cooked, tougher beef- we recommended skipping those. \n\nDrinks were average price for white table cloth dining, and were made very stiff. No disappointment here. \n\nDessert options looked great, and we opted for the bomboloni's after seeing other Yelp reviews. They were just \"ok\". Even fried doughnuts with barely any filling inside, which ended up making us both sick later that evening. \n\nOverall we give this place 3.5-4 stars. Worth a try if you want fine dining Italian food when in Vegas, but nothing exciting and certainly not a \"must visit\" venue. We tried it, and don't feel the need to return."

Very good, not as truffly as we both expected.  I got a very pretty beet salad with homemade mozzarella.\n\nAgnolotti and spaghetti for our Primi courses.  As good as the other reviews say.

Be sure to make a reservation and if there are only 2 of you dining, request to sit by the window. All of the staff are well-trained and highly professional, delivering an upscale dining experience from start to finish. \n\nMy sister and I came for a quick dinner before the club and didn't want to get too full, so we only indulged in the starter bread and 1 entree each. The bread basket is exquisite and features 1 piece each of Sourdough, Ciabbata, a salami Stromboli, broccoli Stromboli, and another that I cannot remember. It is accompanied by a white wine olive oil, mascarpone butter, and some type of tapenade. \n\nI ordered the famous Spaghetti. As far as I know, this dish only contains 3 ingredients. Noodles, tomato sauce, basil. Yes, the noodles were a perfect al-dente with just a little bite to them. Yes the sauce was fresh and light, sticking to each noodle. Was this worth $24? No. For only $2 more (and more deserving of the price tag), my sister went with the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli. The ravioli was optimally thin and there was almost no sauce, making the meat the star. It was a rich dish and could easily be shared if you're also getting an appetizer.   \n\nI'm happy to have had my Scarpetta experience and I enjoyed the food and the ambiance, but I don't see any need to come back here for the $24 spaghetti, which is why I settled on 4 stars."

Creamy Polenta - Fricassee of truffled mushrooms\n2. Heirloom Tomato Salad - Burrata, marinated eggplant \nPasta - Served Family Style \n1. Spaghetti - Tomato and Basil \nPiatti - Individual \n1. Fennel Dusted Black Cod - Concentrated tomatoes, mantecato, black olive oil \n2. Organic Jidori Chicken - Mustard spatzle carrots, fegato sauce\nDolce - Served Family Style\n1. Amedei Chocolate Cake - Toasted almond gelato, salted caramel sauce\n\n- Hard to find! Literally, it's like a crevice on the third floor of the Cosmo! WTF, weird entrance. \n- Nice staff. Presentable dining area for larger groups. Fast at wine refills. \n- I loved the spaghetti! Although simple, the noodles tasted great! The flavoring was fresh and rich. \n- Their polenta was unremarkable. Cornmeal boiled in porridge. I prefer simple mashed potatoes. \n- Fresh tomato salad! Loved the ripe tomatoes. But awkward to eat as family-style. \n- The chicken was soft and tender. Not too salty. I'm glad I got this over the Cod. Although the cod was flavored nicely, I didn't like picking some of the bones out of it. \n- Dessert was amazing. Not too sweet, but the correct balance to end of the meal.\n- Overall, nice plating and nice night."

The service was great.  Every single person from hostess to maitre d to waiter to bus boys was incredibly attentive and friendly.  The food was fantastic.  We had the tasting menu.  It's a great deal for $85 per person.  So much food, you won't come out hungry. They've selected the dishes they are best known for as part of their tasting menu.  I love how the first couple courses are paired with another dish that is shared by the table.  It feels like you are having 10 dishes!  We also did the wine pairing.  Very generous pours.  My favorite dishes were the short rib agnoletti and home-made pasta.  Devine meal.  Definitely will come back and try some other dishes!  Scott Conant and his team have done a fabulous job."

            "review": "4th of July weekend in Vegas - we thought it would be nuts, but we were pleasantly surprised we were able to make a reservation for Scarpetta. \n\nWe were thrilled when the hostess seated us right next to a window, and no sooner had we sat when the fireworks started over Caesar's Palace! Our waiter was smart enough to know we having a romantic moment watching them and let us be until the end. Shortly after, he arrived and took our drink orders. I believe he was a bit new - possibly a bit nervous, but he had very good instincts and was very nice. Our water glasses did not go empty once and empty plates/glasses were removed immediately. Again, our waiter was not in a rush, but he was not ignoring us either....he really set a nice pace for us for the meal. It was nice to take our time and enjoy the ambiance, which is really a highlight of this restaurant. \n\nThe meal: We're pretty avid fans of the Food Network, and while you'd think the celebrity chefs might be overrated on the Strip especially, I have never had a bad experience with these types of restaurants. This was no exception. The bread basket is to die for....if we knew we weren't going to pay a mint for the meal itself, we might have stuffed ourselves with that alone. Our waiter recommended the spaghetti, which the chef is particularly known for. We decided to split it (they're not snobby about that at this place which is great!) as an appetizer - and it was very good. My boyfriend said he likes my spaghetti better, but I loved it. We had the veal chop for the entree, which we also split - that was very good as well. \n\nOverall, I don't think our meal was crazy expensive - it was very much in line with the price you'd pay at any other of the strip restaurants. The portions were small, yes, but we also respect not gorging ourselves to death...that's what the buffets are for. \n\nI can't say what would make me give this restaurant a 5 star rating as opposed to a 4 star...but, I'm definitely willing to go back to find out. Enjoy the Cosmopolitan - it's stunning inside, enjoy this restaurant - the views and food are great, and enjoy each other if you're in a romantic mood - this is the place!"

We shared the roasted beat salad, burrata, duck & foie gras ravioli, and sirloin. For dessert: we shared an italian version of a beignet the name of which I can't remember.

She said she had the spaghetti a year ago in Miami and has been dreaming about it ever since.  Now I know why!\nBefore I get too far ahead of myself though, let me start at the beginning of my experience. My group was pretty large and scattered throughout the strip. A few of us were fashionably late but the hostess had no problem seating those of us who were there on time. That's uncommon for shi-shi- type places and I really appreciated it. The decor was a dark/ modern/ rustic all-at-the-same time- type of feel. Very sexy place :o) Plus it overlooks the Bellagio fountains and the Strip! Nothing like enjoying a killer meal with that type of view. \nThe sommelier was a delight. He helped us pick out a wine that had the qualities we wanted without breaking the bank. We thought it was hilarious when he said \"How about this vintage\" while pointing right at the price. Very classy way to help price-concerned consumers w/o announcing to the entire room that we were trying to save money.\nA bread basket is usually of no consequence BUT, here, it was SOOOOO good! One roll in particular had prosciutto or salami wrapped in and it was amazing! Fresh, warm, and perfect!\nWe shared a bunch of starters.  I got the yellowtail fully intending to share but that did not happen. It was so fresh and delicious with the shredded red onion on top that it somehow disappeared before I could send my plate around the table... OOPS!  I also managed to get a bite for my friend's creamy polenta. To. Die. For. says it all.\nNext, our main course  - the spaghetti. Let me preface this by saying that 6 out the 7 people in our party ordered it because my friend hyped it up so much. We were not disappointed. I normally try to stay away from carbs and I seriously cannot remember the last time I went out and actually ordered spaghetti! It was just so good! It wasn't a heavy, flowery mess of wet spaghetti strands. It was light, tasty, cooked, and sauced to perfection. PS. it was great on its own - no meatballs or anything necessary to dress it up. That is a plate I would certainly order again. \nIn sum, I had a great experience. I paid ~ $100 for bread, pasta, some sashimi, and 3 glasses of wine and I still can say that it was well worth the price.  I would go back and definitely recommend Scarpetta - Vegas to friends!  :o)"

I felt that he was pushy and was trying to upsell.  I had the pici, and that was plenty for me.  Had we followed his suggestion, we would have had a lot of leftover food.  \n\nI do recommend that you try out their specialty drinks.  Those were superb.\n\nOverall, Scarpetta is about a 3.5."

Thy were all delicious but I especially enjoyed the eggplant caponata.\n\nI ordered the Wagyu beef tartare as my appetizer. The beef wasn't as red as I would've liked it to be. It looked brown but I couldn't tell if it was from the bad lighting of the restaurant. The dish had no flavor and I basically had to force myself to eat it.\n\nI ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli with a marsala reduction for my entree. I like that they make their own fresh pasta but the dish lacked the debt of flavor you'd expect from the components of this dish. It was like waiting for a climax that never came.\n\nMy friend really enjoyed her pea soup but the other girls didn't really rave about their dishes. \n\nThe desserts (I forgot which ones we ordered) were great!

But with the spectacular space it occupies (Cosmopolitan Hotel, overlooking the Bellagio fountains), it gets the five star nod from me. \n\nThe perfect ambience is hard to ignore. Unbelievably swanky, Scarpetta just oozes Vegas. Dimly lit, white linens, dark wood and interesting light fixtures mix to create a very upscale atmosphere. \n\nFood wise, I enjoyed two appetizers: the pea soup and sea scallops. The soup excelled where other dishes didn't in that the pea flavor wasn't showed up by the cream. For the other appetizer that made up my one 'entree', I found my scallops to be cooked near-perfectly, but one of them suffered from too much char, rather than a nice caramelization. There was also a too-gratuitous use of garnishes, from radish, to micro greens, to apples and more. Less would've been more when the scallops are served with truffles white asparagus. \n\nThe dishes our friends had all received the same comment: heavy. While its summer and seeing the words 'summer truffles' on multiple dishes is never a bad thing, all those dishes all felt so heavy with butter and/or cream. \n\nI would be remiss if I didn't cap this review with a mention of the bread. Served with dishes containing citrus-infused olive oil, cold eggplant spread and a mascarpone butter, the bread itself was out of this world good (though also heavy, as it's laced with a thin slice of salami and cheese). \n\nI can't say that my Scarpetta experience didn't live up to the hype. However, like much of Vegas, there was a sliver of feeling that the food itself didn't quite live up to the glitz and glamor of the restaurant itself."

Scott Conant is also a celebrity chef that is on some Food Network shows.  I happened to be at a conference at the Cosmopolitan (my new favorite hotel in Vegas, BTW), and I figured I might as well stop by and try out the food at Scarpetta.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant has a good view of the faux lake at the Bellagio.  Big windows and a nice decor are the first thing you notice.  The food is what we were really there for, so I was excited about that.  For appetizer, we ordered duck and foie gras ravioli's with a wine reduction sauce.  This was just amazing....heavy and rich, but it is foie gras, so you should expect that.  Since it was a regular menu item and not an appetizer, they split it in half for my co-worker and I.\n\nUpon receiving the raviolis, our server (who was very good....attentive and knowledgable) brought over a basket of 3 breads.  One was ciabatta, one was a focaccia (or something similar) with pork (prosciutto, maybe?) and cheese rolled into it.  I can't remember the third bread, but it was also good.\n\nNext up was the main meal.  I ordered the spaghetti (with tomato and basil), and my co-worker ordered the branzino.  The spaghetti is what I had seen featured multiple times on TV, and I am always a skeptic.  I didn't think it could possibly be the best spaghetti I had ever had, but I was wrong.  This spaghetti was the absolute best I have ever had.  There was so much flavor concentrated on FRESH pasta.  Every bite was heaven, and for $24, I would order it again for sure.  Vegas (and NY) are both expensive for nice restaurants, so the price tag is high compared to your local favorite Italian place, but the pasta just isn't the same.\n\nMy co-workers branzino was also excellent.  Served with some greens and onion, it was cooked perfectly (crispy skin), and the flavor was very fresh.  \n\nI can't say enough about this restaurant.  I highly recommend anyone going to the Cosmopolitan check this place out.  Definitely one of my better dining experiences for Italian food."

Our host Bex was amazing and truly opened the door for us to experiencing the world of V.I.P.! The staff was very polite and helpful. Our private room was spectacular-we had an amazing view of the Belagio Fountain!\n\nThe executive sous chef came out to talk to us and gave us an intro on their specialties. I am the type of person who cannot make up their mind on what to order so the chef gave me some suggestions and there we began our round of unforgettable appetizers. \n\nI definitely lived it up that night-felt so important and spoiled to have the staff wait on us the way they did. Small details like having the chair pulled out for you, the napkin laid across your lap, even the pretty bottles of water all added up.\n\nThe food, of course, was other worldly. Everything from the main course to the desserts were such a dream. I could not believe I was eating all the delicious food that I see hyped up so much on tv. \n\nI notice a lot of small details and absolutely everything-even the atmosphere as well as the design of the restaurant was beautiful, unique, and classy. The whole experience at Scarpetta exceeded above and beyond in all areas. I have never been so pampered my whole life and I simply CANNOT and will NOT do Vegas any other way! I highly recommend!!!!!"

            "review": "Like almost any restaurant, Scarpetta has its pros and cons. Let's start with the positives.\n\nAmbience: when you walk in you have to go through the bar to get to the dining room. The bar is long and narrow. It is quite inviting and incredibly attractive. They have small alcoves that seat two on the right hand side that would make a wonderful place to come to have a romantic drink before your evening starts. The main dining room is also beautifully decorated. If you were lucky enough to get a seat by the window, you have a terrific you of the Bellagio fountains as well as looking down the Las Vegas Boulevard Strip. The tables are very nicely spaced so that you can have quiet conversation with the friends with whom you are dining and not be bothered by conversations from other tables. \n\nFood: the meal starts with a small basket of breads placed on the center of the table. If it were possible to have a \"bread orgasm\",  then the four of us had that shared experience on eating the breads. Wow, it was that good! We decided we would share the Pici ( normally a main course) as an appetizer for the four of us. This dish was incredibly good. It consisted of a green pasta cooked al dante with a generous portion of lobster meat mixed in. The sauce was a bit spicy but it was delicious. I had the New York strip steak as my main course. The quality of the meat was really mediocre even though it was cooked appropriately. I expected it to be much better in a high end restaurant. It came with some vegetables that were delicious. In addition we ordered a side of mushrooms for the table. This too was incredibly delicious. We shared a chocolate cake for dessert. The chocolate cake was a rich dark chocolate with a small scoop of gelato on top. The cake made me feel as if I had died and gone to heaven.\nService: while our waiter did nothing wrong, he certainly did nothing to make us feel welcome. The service runners brought the food in a timely fashion although it was a little surprising that they did not know who was supposed to get which dish. The bus boy was it quite good. Our water glasses never got below half full."

Our custom wedding cake with vanilla and chocolate marble cake with peanut buttercream was the most amazing cake I have ever had in my life (our guests said the same thing).

I love salami and bread, so put the two together.....FUGGETABOUTIT!\n\nWe had the tasting menu: \n\n- Duo of Yellowtail and Tuna \"Susci\": melt in your mouth delicious!\n\n- Roasted Sea Scallops, Cauliflower, Bottarga, Chili and Caper Salmoriglio: Sea scallops can be rubbery and chewy if not cooked properly, but at Scarpetta, they were cooked to perfection. They had the consistency of flaky, firm fish and the roasted cauliflower was a perfect pairing.\n\n- Spagetti Tomato Basil - simple and good, but not memorable.\n\n- Black Cod, Caramelized Fennel & Concentrated Tomatoes - The fish was nice and flakey and the tomatoes added a nice acidity to the fish. I'm not a fan of fennel as they are too \"licorice-y\" in flavor for my taste.\n\n- Spiced Duck Breast, Endive, Preserved Orange and Cippollini - DELICIOUS! I love duck, but I hate when its not cooked properly or tastes overly fatty. This was a perfect balance. The preserved orange cut through the richness of the duck. Yum!\n\n- Amedei Chocolate Cake & Toasted Almond Gelato - Toasted almond gelato & salted caramel sauce. SELF EXPLANATORY....IT WAS HEAVEN!\n\nWhat made this experience special was that the chef brought out a few mini appetizers with every dish served, so it was like having an \"extended\" tasting menu. He brought out:\n\n- CRISPY FRITTO MISTO - seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon\n- CREAMY POLENTA - fricassee of truffled mushrooms: By far my favorite dish at Scarpetta. Upon first glance, it looks like it would be too heavy and rich, but it was AMAZING!\n- SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI - brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb.\n- ZEPPOLE - nutella center, vanilla sauce and candied hazelnuts. Need I say more?\n\nI loved the ambiance and service of this restaurant. We were seated by the window facing the fountains of Bellagio. A beautiful place to take someone on a date!"

This place killed it in that department -- it was warm, cozy, and romantic (but it's also a great group spot -- there were tons of groups dining while we were there).\n\nThe sommelier helped us choose the perfect wine that was within our budget.  It was super earthy, full bodied, and reminded me of being in Italy!  \n\nWe had the duck and foie ravioli, the black seafood pasta, and the veal and all were outstanding!

We should have chosen somewhere else to have our \"nice\" dinner to celebrate our friends anniversary.\n\nOur party of 4 booked a reservation on OpenTable the night before, and 8:30pm was the only timeslot left available.  Everything went smooth upon checking in.  They serve complimentary bread which is actually a variety of different breads which was pretty cool.   Unfortunately that was just about the only good thing of the evening.\n\nThe entire night we felt rushed by the waiters and the staff. Our waiter seemed impatient while we were ordering and even when they brought the food out, they would come up from behind us and put the food on the table and then disappear. It took forever to get more bread and refills on water.  Our waiter seemed irritated when we asked for more bread.\n\nAs for the food, it was meh. The best tasting thing was our appetizer, the grilled octopus and squid ($20).  For entree, I ordered the foie gras ravioli ($28) since I'd never tried foie gras before.  If it's supposed to taste wonderful, then I obviously ordered the wrong dish.  I didn't even eat half.  The two boys at our table ordered the Short Rib Agnolotti ($26) and it was good for the first few bites, but the taste was bland after you ate a few.  They didn't finish their pasta either.\n\nI've definitely been better to Italian places, with much better service as well. Definitely won't be back."

I loved the staff here.\n\nNo joke, that bread basket with trio of citrus infused olive oil, eggplant spread and mascarpone butter...is to die for!

The presentation was simple and clean with four thin slices of yellowtail topped with olio di zenzero, microgreens and sea salt.  It was so simple but you could taste the freshness.\n\nFor my next course, I ordered the Short Rib Agnolloti.  Perfection.  The brown butter and horseradish sauce was flavorful and had the right amount of kick to pull the dish together.  It was a very small portion but was perfect for a light dinner before going out.  My friends ordered the Spaghetti with Tomato and Basil, Black Tagliolini, and Orata Rossa.  They all enjoyed their meals and the experience at Scarpetta.\n\nOur amazing waiter Matt, surprised our table with a birthday plate of an assortment of Italian cookies which were an amazing finish to a great meal.\n\nGreat ambiance, view of the Bellagio fountain, service, food...overall an amazing dinner!!"

Service and food really don't match the price if you ask me. I think it's mostly about ambiance.

Trendy, loud hipsters abound, bad sign.  There is a tiny sign that you have to walk down a half corridor to see if this is indeed Scarpetta.\n\nThe hostest, why are they all idiots, sat us in a half circle booth behind a party of 8.  So much for the view of the Strip.  Then it got worse, every waiter, bus-boy, customer as they passed behind us used the back the booth as a rail.  Pat, pat, pat 6 inches behind my head.  Awesome!  The interior of the place is the cause of this bad layout.  Giant columns everywhere, wrapped in god-awful brown padding.\n\nI got the waiter and told him we needed to move.  He scurried away to get the manager?!?  She came over and did move us, hence the extra 1/2 star.  She moved us to the window, so I got to see the Strip with a large drape in the way, that hadnt been dusted in forever.  \n\nOn to the food, achoo!  Yes I sneezed my way through the dust cloud from pushing drape out of the way.  The salads were good, we split a garden salad and an heirloom tomato salad.  Then I ordered duck & foie gras ravioli & my dining companion ordered the halibut wrapped in pancetta.  Oh Scott Conant, yea of pretty hair and arrogance, you can't cook pastas right!  It was over cooked.  Here is a hint, if all the raviolis stick together its over cooked.  If they are gummy and mushy its over cooked.  The halibut was dry, really dry, I mean damn I need a lot of water to eat this dish dry.  For dessert we split the donuts stuffed with vanilla cream or nutella, they were pretty good.  \n\nThe waiter was ok, he got his wine varietals mixed up and he had a Richie-Rich hair do, not kidding, that was humorous.  The bread guy is priceless, an old italian guy with good bread who should have been running the place.  He probably forgot more about pastas than Scotty-boy knows.\n\nAll in all a forgettable experience, unless you like overpriced, mediocre food.  The rest of these 4 star reviews I got to wonder about, I mean their fav thing was the bread so 4 stars?"

Everything was spot-on for our visit. Despite having made last-minute reservations, we requested and received a booth where all four of us could see the fountains. The appetizers were amazing: we tried the pea soup, polenta, scallops, and short ribs. For entrees, two of us had the duck and foie gras ravioli, which I will be dreaming about for a long time; the aged sirloin; and the spaghetti. One of us had dessert (yeah, that would be me), a coconut panna cotta in a guava soup. Perfect. My only complaint: the wine prices. They are, in a word, astronomical. I expect to pay double retail prices usually, maybe a bit more in Vegas, but Scarpetta is at least quadruple. So my husband chose beer, and I went with two glasses of wine and called it a day, rather than having to sell myself on the Strip for a bottle."

Several of us ordered the spaghetti for dinner and really enjoyed it - the sauce was nice and light and the basil really popped in the dish.  We also commented on the quality of the homemade pasta noodles.  A simple yet well done dish.

I got the foie gras duck ravioli, which was solid and full of flavor. My bf got the short rib agnolotti, and if I could do it over again I would have done the same. While my ravioli was good, the agnolotti was excellent. Either way, you can't go wrong with their fresh-made pastas. \n\nUnfortunately we were too full to get more than a glass of wine or dessert (thanks to an all you can eat brunch buffet), but I'm sure the dessert and cocktails would have been great.

We made it to our reservation on time, yet we still had to wait 20 minutes, which was alittle annoying considering we had made reservations. Though we didn't get a fountain view, we were too hungry at that point to care. \nOur server immediately bought out a bread basket with a trio of olive oil, eggplant and honey butter.

For our entrees we got PRIME FILET OF BEEF and RAVIOLI FOIE GRAS AND DUCK. Though the ravioli was underwhelming, there was lot of ravioli squares which really was great. The filet of beef, on the other hand, was absolutely amazing. It was perfectly cooked and the softest beef I've ever had in my life. This really was the greatest dish I've ever eaten in my life and I was beyond impressed. \nFor dessert, we had mentioned that it was our anniversary and were given a chocolate cake with HAPPY ANNIVERSARY writing, which was a lovely surprise. Sadly,. the cake was very dry but the ice-cream helped. \nIn all I would highly recommend Scarpetta and would love to come back here for our next Vegas trip!!"

Every single morsel of food that passed our lips was a taste sensation.  We started out with the seared sea scallops, the chestnut soup and the beet salad.  Each was out of this world delicious!  Our entrees consisted of the black cod which was buttery and perfect, the Sicilian spiced duck breast which was tender and tasty and the duck and foie gras ravioli which was creamy and sensational.  We ended our dinner with two desserts and I would highly recommend the Coconut Panna Cotta Guava Soup with Carmelized Pineapple.  Double-yum!  Service was outstanding and although we did not have have a table with a view overlooking the Las Vegas Strip, we enjoyed our comfortable booth with room enough on the table for all the dishes we ordered. I would DEFINITELY want to return to this restaurant again and would highly recommend it to everyone."

            "review": "I must admit, my expectations were somewhat low for Scarpetta, as I usually find the Las Vegas outposts of famous restaurants to be more about decor and overpriced menus, and less about food.  I was glad to be proven wrong.\n\nAlthough Scarpetta definitely delivers in the \"Las Vegas Hip\" decor, with a gorgeous dining room that has a glass-enclosed wine cellar on one wall, and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Bellagio fountains on the other, it also delivers on the food front.\n\nAt the waiters recommendation, my group of three decided to share a Primi (app) and Pasta, and order our own entrees.  Before our first course came out, we were brought fresh bread basket which I can honestly say was the BEST bread I've ever had.  A mix of rosemary ciabatta, focaccia, and this to-die-for bread that had salami and mozzarella in it.  The accompaniments of Olive Oil, Eggplant spread, and Mascarpone Butter were equally satisfying.  Here is a by-dish review:\n\nHeirloom tomato salad w/ stracciatella, salsa verde & marinated eggplant:  This dish was good, if not a bit common.  It seems so many restaurants have an heirloom tomtato & burrata dish, that if you've had one, you've had them all - although I was happy to learn that stracciatella is an equally awesome burrata-style cheese.\n\nCreamy polenta w/ fricassee of truffled mushrooms: Hands down the best polenta anyone at our table had ever had.  It was so creamy and rich, and went great with the mushrooms which were served from a separate pot.\n\nDuck & Foie Gras ravioli w/ marsala reduction:  This dish was very well received by the two people in my party who'd never had foie gras.  I am a huge fan of foie, and found the dish to be lacking the richness that usually comes when it's served on it's own - but overall a great dish.\n\nPancetta-wrapped Veal Loin w/ sweetbreads, peas & carrots: The veal loin was my favorite dish of the night.  I am used to having sweetbreads battered and fried, so it was interesting to have them in a more natural state - small chunks cooked and mixed in with the vegetables.\n\nZeppole w/ nutella center, vanilla sauce & candied hazelnuts: WOW - we were blown away by how good this dessert was.  Little chocolate donut holes filled with nutella - YUM.\n\nI will say that their wine list leans towards the expensive side, with only a few bottles in the $60 - $70 range.  We ordered the Castello di Bossi Chianti Classcio Riserva Berardo, which was $105 (retails for $30) - a good wine, but a bit pricey."

            "review": "I went here on a very specific mission: duck & foie gras ravioli. I barely even glanced at the menu - all I needed was confirmation that the ravioli was still there. And while it took awhile to get to the point where I got to finally eat the ravioli, it did not disappoint (an oh-so-divine 5 stars).\n\nWhen we arrived, we were promptly seated. However, we were actually seated more in the bar area than the actual restaurant area (which appeared to have a decent view). Where we were seated was ok, though. It was a curved booth that had a very private feel to it. But it was near impossible to take in and experience the ambiance where seated.\n\nOur server was nice and knowledgeable. I stated what I planned on eating and he was able to recommend a glass of wine to pair with it. However, when our food arrived, there was no ravioli. I had been delivered some other duck dish instead. Having to send it back and sit there while the others I was with completely finished their meals was quite awkward. And while the server who actually delivered the food apologized, our main server, who took our order, said nothing. \n\nThe whole mix-up experience seemed very un-Vegas. No apologies, no \"dessert is on us\", no nothing. I honestly felt treated like I was the one who screwed up (despite being very clear on what I wanted - and it was my sole purpose in dining here - and having witnesses who can vouch to what I ordered).\n\nSo despite the ravioli being a home run, I have to deduct stars for the rest of the experience. \n\nBut OMG the ravioli is beyond fantastic. I literally sat there and considered ordering a 2nd helping. Move over Mario Batali - your beef cheek ravioli now has some serious competition. In fact, the duck & foie gras ravioli at Scarpetta may actually be better than B&B's beef cheek ravioli. I'm going to have to that 2nd helping in order to confirm, but I may indeed have a new favorite Vegas dish.\n\nSo yeah, fab food, but not-so-hot first dining experience."

Wine pairing was good, considering the price point ($45 for the pairing), but we would have gladly paid more for a premium wine pairing option.\n\nOutstanding evening.  Don't be in a rush - I wouldn't go here pre-theater.  Dinner took about 2 1/2 hours - we enjoyed every minute."

            "review": "This place was fantastic! Here's the breakdown:\nAmbiance- the decor was very modern, there were some very cool light fixtures above the bar and in the bar seating area. My only issue would be that the tables were VERY CLOSE together- it made it difficult to navigate the restaurant to get to the bathroom without getting in the way of the waiters trying to work. \nService- A+ from start to finish. We did not see an open reservation on OpenTable so we called  and the maitre d' was so wonderful and gracious and was able to fit us in! We got a great table by the window and our waiter was just great. He took us through the menu, made great suggestions and really made us feel taken care of. \nFood- overall very good. For starters my fiance and I split the diver scallops (a small portion but we were not very hungry). The scallop was cooked perfectly, and the marcona almonds really added a delicious flavor and crunch. My only complaint would be the lack of flavor from the golden raisins that the menu said were in the dish. I was hoping for that sweet flavor but I never tasted it. For dinner we got the Pici and the Short Rib Agnolotti. These were both great! The Pici was spicy (which I enjoyed but my fiance thought was a little too much), and the Short Rib Agnolotti was phenomenal- possibly one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had! For dessert we had the coconut panna cotta which was actually quite tasty- not something I would have normally ordered but I was pleasantly surprised -a good mix of flavors and very refreshing!\nOverall- I would absolutely go here again and I have already recommended this restaurant to two other friends that are planning upcoming trip to Vegas!"

I sampled the oysters, which if I recall had a mignonette sauce which was excellent, very \"bright\" tasting.  Also had the lentils and squid.  The lentils were amazing and the squid perfectly cooked.  \n\nFor dinner I had the \"Pici\" (pasta) served with lobster, tarragon, almond & chili pesto.  It was perfectly portioned but still a little \"heavy\".  I paired that with a side order of broccoli rabe and a nice house Chianti.  No dessert for our group.

I'm not expecting to be treated like a king but when paying nearly top dollar and excited to dine in this restaurant i was really disappointed. will not be going back to this restaurant 100% due to lack of great hospitality. \n\nas stated before 2 thumbs up to the chefs and BOH staff and runners, but to my server, you should probably realize its just not just a paycheck you are collecting, if you want repeat guests you should probably try to provide good service. \n\nso disappointed, wish i was more happy..."

She was absolutely right (she usually is ;) and I have been back several times since first trying it with her. \n\nThe restaurant is beautifully done .. very contemporary and chic .. and most every seat boasts a fabulous view of the Bellagio Fountain show. It's a great place for entertaining out-of-town guests for sure. One time we even had the privilege of being seated at the \"Chefs\" Table (which is in a private room) with a prime view of the Fountain Show and the entire kitchen. \n\nThe food .. what can I say .. everything we've tried there is spectacular! My favorites are the Short Rib Agnolotti, which is simply melt-in-your mouth goodness and the Tagliatelle with Fall vegetables, truffle zabagalione & guanciale, which is just the right amount of truffle and is nice and light. I've also tried that famous Spaghetti .. it's good, very good, but not something that I would order again. Some of my dining partners have tried the Lobster Pasta, the Black Cod and the Duck Breast and the little bites I tried were good, but not necessarily items I would order. \n\nFrom the starters, my favorites are the Creamy Polenta, again with Truffle :) and the Braised Short Ribs of Beef. The Calamari and the Scallops are also good, but we keep going back to the Polenta. \n\nDessert .. the most important part of the meal .. the second time we were there, we saw something at another table that looked delicious and right up our alley .. turns out it was not on their menu but from the neighboring Scott Conant eatery DOCG Enoteca. It's called the Salted Caramel Budino with Pretzel Toffee.  It is super creamy and  the perfect balance of both sweet and salty at the same time. We shared it the first go-around but now order one each whenever we go .. and that rarely happens. \n\nThe service is impeccable, friendly knowledgeable servers and bussers who go the extra mile and have great personalities. The first time we were there my dining partner mentioned she was heading to DC the following weekend and our server came back with a list of fun things / places for her to do while she was there."

March was PERFECT!\n\nThis review is for July 25 2015.\nBar service is pretty good except for the bar back standing in front of me while I am eating my meal cleaning glass after glass! Scrubbing with a towel getting off all of the spotts. Flinging that towel like no tomorrow!  I am the only person at the bar! Really stand right there?!  Can you move down a few feet so I can enjoy without having to watch you work? Very annoying!\n\nI came back to Scarpetta after a wonderful meal in March. In March it was a meal of a life time. Ricardo was an awesome waiter and everything was over the top. Berry Mash, Lardo Prawns, Short Rib Angolotti and a Panacotta to die for! Not so much this trip. \n\nMy Cocktail was a Berry Mash. It was ok but very bitter and not balanced.\n\n1st appetizer was the Lardo prawns. Something in March that was very impressive. This time they were over cooked and dry. The heads didn't have much juice due to being over cooked. The Lardo was almost crisp and they were tough. \n\nMy 2nd appetizer was the Short rib Angolotti. It was good but a very small portion for an app! it was about 8-10 small pastas. Good but I would have been better off with the entree! \n\nThe female bartender was kind and hit the basic marks for service but was busy BSing with fellow workers and hard to find when these issues came to the surface. So I just went along with my meal and passed on the Panacotta. \n\nI came home in March after my visit and bragged about Scarpetta to all of my friend and family. It was one of the best places I have ever eaten as well as one of the best meals. This time not so much and not sure of I will return. I like many of Scotts dishes but I have no room for inconsistency in a restaurant of this caliber! It should be perfect every time!"

Warm Edison style lighting cascading above with a panoramic window view of the Bellagio fountains! What more could you ask for? Well, yeah great service comes with your reservation as well. Our server Titus was a pro! He was thoughtful friendly and attentive. That said, the supporting staff and sommelier were equally charming and helpful.  \n\nI decided on the New Year's Eve pre fixe, no brainer right with a bottle of bubbly to accompany the memorable experience. \n\nOur first course was a tuna tartare prepared with pine nuts and topped with micro greens. The texture was light with a supple mouthfeel. It had a subtle nutty flavor to it tasting almost like a steak tartare, which I adore.  Two small toastettes accompanied this whimsically delicious starting dish, as well.\n\n\nSecond course was a roasted sea scallop topped with foie gras and served with a butternut squash raisin caper caponata. Now I've had my share of scallop dishes and for the most part I'm usually left feeling underwhelmed  but not with this dish. Foie gras and scallops are like a match made in foodie heaven. The thick and beautifully seared scallop medallion paired with rich velvety foie gras and the sweet & salty tang of the creamy butternut squash and caper caponata made each bite a flavor explosion in my mouth. Superb!\n\n\nJust when I thought it couldn't get better, the following dish blew me away! A pumpkin ravioli topped with crumbled amaretto cookies. The Hand made ravioli was soft and perfectly cooked, the creamy pumpkin coupled with crunchy amaretto cookies was a play on all my senses! The sweet flavor and fragrant aroma also made this intoxicating dish not only decadent  but a satisfying flavor journey I'd gladly take again and again! \n\n\nThe final savory dish was a wagyu beef served atop a creamy mash with spinach. Now this dish speaks for itself. You simply can't go wrong with perfectly medium rare wagyu beef. It just melts in your mouth, literally! It's a symphony of delights from start to finish. Encore! \n\nFrom the amazing cuisine, exceptional service, sleek & cool environs and awesome view, I really couldn't ask for more out of a wonderfully unforgettable NYE dinner.\n\nBravo Scarpetta!!!"

Also, after finding out that the man behind the restaurant is a judge from The Food Network's Chopped, I was sold.\n\nThe food did not disappoint. We had the yellow tail as an appetizer, then the famed spaghetti and the sirloin. We decided we were going to share everything and the kitchen was actually nice enough to split each dish so that it was presented on two separate plates to us. Each plate looked exactly as it would if it were the full portion. To top that off, they didn't even charge a splitting fee like so many restaurants usually would! That is what I call spectacular service. \n\nI'm a sucker for bread and their bread basket had me half full before we even ordered! The bread filled with salami and cheese was the favorite. It came with 3 dipping sauces, a marscapone cheese, tomato with eggplant, and a citrus oil. I thought the best combination was the citrus oil with the tomato and eggplant. \n\nThe yellow tail was fresh and had a nice chili kick to it. There were small chunks of rock salt that added a little crunch. It came with 4 slices of yellow tail, which was actually more than we expected.\n\nThe spaghetti lives up to its reputation. It was beautifully presented, swirled up into a pile and they uncover the plate right in front of you. The sauce is perfectly seasoned and the tomatoes still have a slight acidity. The pasta itself is cooked al dente and they're beautifully thick spaghetti noodles. I had to eat this one noodle at a time so I could make it last as long as possible. \n\nThe sirloin was cooked to our liking, but it was a bit chewy. We both loved the vegetables that came underneath it. There were carrots, mushrooms, potatoes, and probably some others and they were all so good!\n\nAt the last minute, we decided to get the amedei chocolate cake with the almond gelato and salted caramel sauce. The gelato was my favorite part of the plate, although it looked partly melted by the time it got to the table. The chocolate cake was like a lava cake, where the middle is still fudge like. It could have been warmer. I thought the plate could use more of the gelato and almond gelato to balance out how rich the chocolate is. Also, the bf ordered a coffee and it came with refills! \n\nOne complaint is that we were seated along the wine fridge and someone would come by every once in a while and just open it up behind us. Having the chilled refrigerator air interrupt a nice meal isn't the most fun. But if you are seated by the window, there is an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains.\n\nFor the price, it was actually a good amount of food and it is quality food. I really cannot wait for the spaghetti again. When I eat my jarred Preggo tomato sauce, I'll be fantasizing about the spaghetti here."

You'd think you'd be dealing with staff that think they have better things to do than tend to your every whim but you get just the opposite. I was a little disappointed that we didn't get a table looking out to Bellagio's fountains but we got somewhat of a consolation prize and sat along the windowed wine cellar. \n\nEveryone rants and raves about their bread basket. I can tell you right now none of it is exaggerated. You get a wonderful medley of bread but the one that takes the cake is the stromboli bread. Packed with meat and cheese, you could easily fill up on them. Fight it kids. Fight the feeling! Eat one and just wait for your main entree to come out.\n\nThe roasted sea scallop was one of the largest scallops I've ever encountered. Plump, juicy and flavorful. It was served on steamed cauliflower with a splash of creamed cauliflower sauce. Both the scallop and cauliflower complimented each other perfectly. What kind of irked me was the menu described the appetizer as, \"Roasted Sea Scallops.\" When you see the word \"scallops\" you assume you get more than one. Breaking news. You only get one. It's big nonetheless but remember that you only get one.\n\nScott Conant's twist on the spaghetti may seem simplistic at first glance but once you taste it you can tell there is a lot more that goes on behind the scenes. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the dish fell short. The noodles were well undercooked. I like my noodles undercooked but with every bite, I could taste the rawness of the noodles in the middle. The cheese and garlic olive oil is already infused in the pasta but it was overly cheesy. I thought it took away from the tomato and basil flavor. What I did enjoy was the bit of spiciness you get. It gave the spaghetti some life. \n\nOverall the service was nothing short of elegance but the food, with the exception of their bread basket, was painfully average."

The main room has a window view of the Bellagio fountains, which set the mood and were going off every 15-20 minutes or so. Food was pretty good for the most part. Lady had the prix fixe and I had a few a la carte choices. The tuna app was super fresh and perfect for the evening. The celeriac soup was silky and very good. The bread is awesome. I know it sounds weird to rate the free shit, but their \"stromboli\" bread with the marscapone butter could be a meal in itself. Pumpkin ravioli was great. The filet and short rib mash was on point. The only thing that I was disappointed in was the foie/duck ravioli. It just wasn't what I thought it would be . It was good, and a rather large portion, but I expected something else. Dessert was ho-hum as well. Regardless, I would come back as the service was great and the ambiance was great."

Scarpetta fell on the night we celebrated my birthday, and I am so glad! \n\nThe restaurant looks great and the service is perfect. The waiters are all extremely knowledgeable and can answer pretty much anything. \n\nBut who cares about that? The food... it was ridiculous! To begin with they bring out some bread, as with most restaurants, but Scarpetta bread is next level! There were some regular rolls which were bomb. But there was this one type, no clue what it was called...but it had some kind of meat inside! I thought the waiter mentioned that to us, but I figured I was hallucinating. Nope! It was phenomenal. The bread also came with butter and other accoutrement. All delicious!\n\nSo I could have left happy at this point. But my food slayed me. I think I may have actually died, said what up to a couple of angels, and then rejoined my table after frolicking on a cloud or two. I ordered the Black Fettuccine (pasta dyed with squid ink, adorned with king crab, squid, shrimp, and breadcrumbs while bathing in lobster broth). Need I say more? It tasted better than it sounds. It was more than worth the $42 it cost. \n\nI also tried my friends' flank steak (amazing) and black cod (also amazing). But lets be real...I won.\n\nAs a dessert we shared:\n\nBombolone - Basically an italian doughnut. There were five. Two filled with nutella and three filled with something white that by some ungodly magic was BETTER than nutella! Never thought I'd say that. It also came with banana gelato which just pushed my taste buds past their limits of joy.\n\nAmadei Chocolate Cake: The richest most delicious chocolate cake you'll ever have. The inside was filled with molten chocolate goodness. It also came with toasted almond gelato. Also heavenly.\n\nI implore you to try this restaurant when in Vegas."

What do you order that makes you #1 not seem like a greedy user or #2 not offend your date by ordering whatever is the absolute cheapest - like just a side of potatoes?\n\nWell that was my dilemma prior to being taken here by Beau S. on 2/1/14 as his other suggestions for dinner secretly made me extremely uneasy, even though I wasn't footing the bill. While still not even remotely cheap, I breathed a sigh of relief knowing that I could order something under the 9 zillion dollar range on their menu. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty but what stuck out to me is that there must be a thousand waiters standing around waiting to swoop in on any possible need you may have. \n\nBased on the amount of pictures on Yelp, I had the duck ravioli ($27) and I really enjoyed it. (I presume) to prove to me that he does in fact eat vegetables since we last dated, Beau ordered Brussels sprouts and spaghetti. He said the sprouts were terrible and he ended up not eating them. His spaghetti looked as if it came from a can. I declined his multiple offers to try some because it looked so bad and let him have some of mine. \n\nI'm not sure what the hype is over the bread basket. I had a good piece of French bread but it wasn't orgasmic like the other reviewers go on about.\n\nDinner lasted 36 whole minutes. We decided to have dessert elsewhere. The food was okay, the atmosphere was fine, but honestly, if I didn't have such a great dinner date, I probably would have forgotten I ate here. Who I was with was really the only draw about this place."

The most decadent, delicious, and just memorable. \n\nAt the tables in Cosmo friday afternoon we were pondering where to have a late dinner before hitting the clubs. The player to my left said Scarpetta had an amazing, but simple spaghetti dish that was to die for. Keeping our fingers crossed, we wandered upstairs around 6:30 and were able to secure a 9:30 reservation and requested a tiny 2 person table in the corner with a great window view. Even though we were running about 15 minutes late, they were gracious enough to hold the table for us. \n\nUpon arrival, we didn't even have to give our name and check in, the host immediately remembered us from 3 hours earlier and sat us promptly at the requested table. The view of the Bellagio and the water show was fantastic! The only issue I had was that we were not given a menu or even a wine list for at least 10-15 minutes after we were seated. Normally this wouldn't be a problem I presume, but it was 9:30 and we were pretty much starving at this point. \n\nAfter we were presented with menus though, the bread basket pretty much had our full attention for a good while. The selection of bread and spreads was DELICIOUS. We literally ate almost all of it...the focaccia was incredible. I ordered a gin and tonic, and my friend a glass of moscato. They were both delicious with our meals. \n\nWe shared the beef carpaccio appetizer, and it was absolutely delicious--just the perfect amount for 2 people to share since we weren't looking to eat a heavy meal, but wanted to try a starter. We shared 2 pasta dishes--the spaghetti everyone raves about and the duck and foie gras ravioli. Personally I absolutely savored the ravioli--i love foie gras and duck, so it was perfect. The Spaghetti my friend liked more--it was simple, but good. \n\nDefinitely coming back here on my next trip to Vegas in May!"

I'm glad I did because the pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors were completely on point without being overwhelmingly tomato-y. Again, portions are very small here - even for the pasta. Perhaps a 1-1.5 cups of pasta for $24...that's pretty steep...albeit delicious. \n\nWould I go back to Scarpetta? Absolutely. It's creative and delicious Italian fare in a gorgeous restaurant.

The food/drinks were always yummy and I have a bit of a love affair going on with the potato chips they set out at the bar. So for this Vegas trip we decided to make a reservation to do the tasting menu. We made a reservation for 8pm on a Friday night (9/30/16). \n\nWe arrived, were seated promptly, but were then left for quite awhile before the waiter came over to talk to us. I mentioned that we wanted to do the tasting menu and was informed that they don't typically do it on weekends (the website specifies that the tasting menu isn't served after 10 pm and that it must be enjoyed by the whole table, but nowhere does it say that it's not available on weekends). The waiter could see that we were disappointed so said he'd ask the kitchen. He came back a bit later and said that kitchen said it was fine, tasting menu a-go. Great! We also did the wine pairing. \n\nThe food:\n- Ok, I know you shouldn't fill up on a bread basket when you are about to do a tasting menu, but oh my god. The sourdough and the stromboli's were our favorite. \n- The first course was a duo of yellowtail and tuna that was their take on sushi. Two wonderful bites, perfect. \n- The second course was a sea scallop with corn and homemade pancetta. The sea scallop and corn were amazing. The piece of pancetta was essentially inedible because it was so incredibly overly salted (and I like salt!). It's the closest I've ever come to spitting food into my napkin. Instead, I just drank an entire glass of water. \n- It's not on the tasting menu, but they brought out an order of the polenta and mushrooms for us compliments of the chef. It was absolutely heavenly. We both kept saying we shouldn't eat all of it because we needed room for the whole meal, but it was just that good. \n- Next was the pasta course. The famous spaghetti and the short rib agnolotti. We'd had the agnolotti before during Social Hour and loved it. We were anxious to try to spaghetti after having heard so many great things about it. It was truly wonderful. Both are flawless dishes; pasta is clearly Scott Conant's specialty. When we finished this course we both looked at each other and said we'd be happy to end dinner with that. \n- Next was fennel dusted black cod. I wasn't a fan of this dish. It was too \"fishy\" for my taste, but it was my first time having black cod so I assumed I just wasn't a fan of the protein. My husband enjoyed his but ate about half as he was getting full. I should've tried his fish as he said he didn't find it overly fishy (whereas I described my piece as licking a rotting fish corpse); but, alas, I didn't. I will say, the vegetables on this plate were amazing.\n- Next was duck breast. I was so excited because duck is one of my favorite things to eat. This duck was good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't great. It was a tad overcooked and it didn't have the best sear on it. The flavors of the dish were great, the duck just could've been cooked better\n-Finally, dessert. We were absolutely stuffed but dessert was just so good, an amazing chocolate cake and gelato. \n\nThe wine:\n- All I can say about the wine pairing was that each and every wine was perfect for the course and delicious. I would give the wine pairing 5 stars. \n\nOverall it was a great meal; but, it was just too much food. We've done a variety of tasting menus (including at e by Jose in cosmo) and this was the only one where we felt the amount of food was overwhelming. It probably has less to do with the total amount of food, as it does with there being 2 pasta courses and us having polenta. \n\nI would've rated our previous dining experiences at Scarpetta at the Social Hour as 5 star. I would have rated this meal as 4 star (simply because of technical flaws with the pancetta and duck breast, and slightly slow service). BUT....after we left the restaurant we started walking back to our room (in Cosmo) to change clothing before going back out. Walking down the 3rd floor hallway to the room elevators I all the sudden felt horrible. Luckily I didn't have to walk too far before finding a restroom, where I began suffering from extremely violent food poisoning. That lasted all night and into the next day. My husband was completely fine. I suspect the black cod (I'm fairly certain the issue came from Scarpetta since for breakfast/lunch we'd split dishes at other places). \n\nTLRD: 3 star review because while the food was amazing, the food poisoning was awful"

I also liked the assortment of bread. The restaurant has a really nice vibe and offers pretty nice views. Four stars instead of five for the following reasons: 1) two of their drinks were not good at all and we had asked the waiter ahead of time if they were sweet, were reassured that they weren't 2) even though we sent one of the drinks back because it was just so gross we didn't get an apology, an offer to replace, or a comp.

            "review": "Great view of the Bellagio fountains, romantical, ok food....\n\nLocated in the Cosmo, my man took me here for my birthday, so I would love to give this place a 5.  But we both agreed for how much you're paying, the food is just ok.  Service was attentive and our waiter made recommendations on the menu.  The ambiance is nice and of course if you can snag a table by the window, you'll have a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains.\n\n*Complimentary bread basket with three different types of dipping oil:  citrus infused olive oil, eggplant, and mascarpone butter.  Would have been nice if the bread was warm.  The eggplant and mascarpone butter is soooo good.\n\n*Short rib agnolotti-  little tortellinis stuffed with short rib in a brown butter  horseradish sauce topped with bread crumbs.    I love short rib so I had to order this.  I could hardly see let alone taste the short rib and the dish seemed like it was drenched in horseradish, making it really strong.  I don't mind some but wow I felt like it was coming out of my nose.\n\n*Ribeye of beef- I laugh because I don't know why my man decided to order a steak at a Italian restaurant, but he was just in the mood for one.  But basically it was average, nothing wow.  Stick to Italian.\n\n* Zepole- Nutella filled donuts topped with candied hazelnuts  with a vanilla dipping sauce.  O.m.g. Sooo deelish.\n\nI don't know if I\"d come back but if I did I'd try the spaghetti.  Small little bowl of simple pasta for 24 bucks, but everyone keeps raving about it and even our waiter recommended it.  So it must have some kick ass sauce and noodles..."

            "review": "As much as I am critical regarding the outlandish folly that which is the Strip, there are, in my opinion, a few exceptional culinary experiences that you can only get here and nowhere else; with breathtaking, majestic feats of visionary engineering, the Strip personifies man's ability to create way beyond his present environment and envision a future filled with unlimited possibilities.  And when a night on the town includes that man-made wonderland, you get magic, an 'Umami' of all the senses.\n\nScarpetta by Chef Scott Conant encompasses that dining experience, and out of all his venues bearing the same name, I enjoy the Vegas restaurant by far.  Although all the restaurants are elegant with great food, this restaurant takes the Vegas experience and showcases style with understated design gestures.  'Scarpetta' means little shoe in Italian, a reference to the menu's 'soulfulness'...  Guess my mind wandered to other references...like, the foot fetish variety - shrimping anyone?  No? Too far?\n\nThe design is deceptively tame; meaning that it's not drenched in the typical Vegas gaudy, interior so-five-seconds ago gimmicks that cause visual Norovirus.  But once you situate and settle down, you notice the lyrical design flow lending itself to a relaxing, calming evening. By then the Fountains at the Bellagio will have sprung into full effect, with sweeping side views of the Lake and the beautiful architecture as a backdrop for the dynamic geysers bursts - a stunning piece of visual entertainment lasting the night.\n\nAfter dining at Scarpetta on numerous occasions, I've come to the conclusion that although everything on the menu is good, I naturally gravitate towards the Pasta section of the menu.  I enjoy all of the home made pastas and the balance with the ingredients that Chef Conant pairs with them.  And to be honest, I'm just tired of entrees, they've become burdensome, overpriced and unusually large with the same old formula: big ass protein with some creamy mush underneath it with a side of blah..yawn.  If anything, I'd get some apps, but I've eaten most of them on the menu; I do recommend the Creamy Polenta + Fricassee of Truffled Mushrooms, The Heirloom Beet Salad and the Braised Shortribs of Beef. (They push the Yellowtail as their signature classic- really...if I wanted Sashimi, I'd go eat at a Japanese restaurant where it's served pure, you really don't need any heavy Onions or Olive Oil or Jalape\u00f1os to mask the flavor of this delicious protein.....TRUTH).  \n\nSpaghetti + Tomato +Basil: An all time favorite of mine, this dish is as simple as it can get (it's up there with Spaghetti all' Aglio Olio e Pepperoncino) but so fresh and light with just a few ingredients, the Pasta shines through as the main character which, being the carb addict that I am, is harmonious!  It's presented as the first dish, based on its levity and absence of protein.  \n\nRicotta + Truffle Agnolotti: The second dish in the fete de pasta is a deep contrast to the acidity of the prior dish, the fluffy pillows filled with Ricotta and covered in a light Truffle Cream Sauce.  I love using the term 'pillows', it describes these soft chewy bite size packages of pasta like a metaphoric squishy rest to the head; that, \"ahhh\" moment when your cranium sinks into a downy cloud.....I love sleep..  The creamy Truffle white sauce has just enough weight to coat your palate without any buyer's remorse and the quantity is perfect for two.\n\nBlack Tonarelli + King Crab + Coddled Egg + Smoked Trout Roe: I'm always excited when I see Squid Ink Pasta on any menu - I relish the slightly briny noodle that goes well with all Seafood toppings.  With this dish, it's even more decadent with the introduction of the Coddled Egg, coating every strand with a sticky liquid goo. It's such oral satisfaction.  Oh, and there's Crab, you really can't go wrong when there's Crab.  \n\nPici + Lobster +Preserved Tangerine + Bottarga: Pici is thick cut pasta, a fat spaghetti, akin to Udon.  It is hearty and appropriately the last pasta course of the evening.  The Pici is paired with Lobster, Preserved Tangerine and Bottarga, a cured fish roe.  The Bottarga amps up the salty briny element while the the juicy Lobster gives a sweet delicate flavor - all the ingredients manage to balance out with the Pasta.\n\nCaramella Milk Chocolate Mousse + Saut\u00e9ed Yellow Peaches + Praline Crunch + Pistachio Bastoni: Okay, this was a bit of a surprise-under our waiter guidance, we ordered this dessert for the first time... this plate of what can only be described as a kindergarden art project with chocolate squares and pistachio logs....  I wonder if the chefs are so bored that they need to play with the food and at the same time give us less.  And in the end, it didn't really have much flavor as compact as it was- it was like a plate of Mignardises that usually come with a post-meal hot beverage.\n\nRatings (Out of Five Stars)\nFood:            4.75\nAmbience:    4.75\nService:         4.5"

            "review": "For our last night in Vegas, we were looking to splurge a bit for our dinner out. I got super excited when I learned this is one of Scott Conant's restaurants because I love Italian food and I see him on Chopped all the time.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the third floor, just take the escalators up near Marquee and Chandelier. I made reservations using open table for 10 pm (a bit late, but we just got drinks in Chandelier beforehand) and were seated shortly after 10 at a table near the windows. We could see the Bellagio and the watershow - very nice view.\n\nFirst off, the bread basket and the toppings for it were so good! A butter marscapone, eggplant, and olive oil were provided to go with the different breads. There was a sourdough and some other types, but my favorite was this bread with mozzarella baked into it. And, I don't even like eggplant, but my favorite bread topping was the eggplant - it was that yummy.\n\nBased on other reviews and what sounded good to us, my friend and I ordered the polenta to start, which was split into two separate dishes for us. Amazingly tasty. I have to say I haven't had polenta before, but I figured this would be a good place to try it, and boy was that a good decision. It was just so creamy with a little bit of a gritty texture, but mmmmm. I don't know how else to describe it.\n\nFor my entree I had the tagliatelle with vegetables, guanciale, and truffle zabaglione - housemade pasta! Another very mmmmmm dish. My tastebuds were happy. And for dessert, I had the coconut panna cotta with guava \"soup\". Perfect end to the meal since it was lighter, fresher, and sweet. \n\nAll in all, I thought the food was great and I would consider coming back if I was splurging a bit. Only thing I didn't really care for was the bathroom. There was only one stall for women and it wasn't that great, and my friend said there was a line of about 6 women when she went. I would expect a nice restaurant to have a nicer bathroom."

We sat next to the window, so we got a great view of the Bellagio fountain. I'm still dreaming of the Black Tagliolini. Order it! It's the perfect balance of salty sea, cream, and butter. It was well balanced, not overly sauced and the tobiko added a nice texture. They are famous for the Spaghetti and it didn't disappoint. The noodles were al dente and the sauce was complex. You could taste the time and care that was put into it. The Amedei Chocolate Cake was a surprise hit. There was a rich chocolate ganache inside and a coco powder dusting outside, which went perfectly with the almond gelato. It reminded me of a well-made truffle. The next time I'm in Vegas I will make sure to visit Scarpetta again."

I'm glad I did. When I lived in Miami I frequented the Scarpetta in the Fontainebleau. The bars in the Miami Scarpetta v the Vegas Scarpetta are very similar. I like the layout of the Vegas Scarpetta better but the views of the two restaurants are the same. Miami overlooks the Fontainebleau pool area and water and Vegas overlooks the Bellagio fountains. The most recent visit to the Vegas Scarpetta was my favorite. One of the specials that night was a black truffle pasta. AMAZING. It was so delicious and filling, total comfort food. Granted it was a $60 (small, probably nutrionally not good for my figure) bowl of pasta but worth every penny (and bite).\n\nOf course service was spot on and the house Riesling was great."

Came here with another couple, and we each ordered a different dish.  Had polenta w/ truffled mushrooms, and salad w/ burrata and roasted beets to start.  We wanted to lick the polenta bowl when we finished, it was that good.  The beets were tasty, too, but the Polenta.... Molto Bene!!\n\nLobster Pici -- fantastic, but the chili pesto was a bit overpowering (Hubby burst into a sweat within the first bite).\nShort Rib & Bone Marrow agnolotti -- Rich, luscious, and not exactly heart healthy, but oh my god good.\nRaviolini w/ ricotta and truffle -- not on the online menu.  Super tasty, and you'll want to have extra bread on your table to sop up every last drop of the sauce (hence the name, Scarpetta!).\nVeal tortellini -- one of the special dishes offered that night, easily the best pasta we had.  With shaved baby carrots on top, each bite was perfectly savory w/ a touch of sweetness.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Amedei chocolate cake and pumpkin souffl\u00e9.  About 15 minutes later, our waiter (\"hot as hell\" Luis) appeared sheepishly at our table to apologize profusely that the souffl\u00e9 were not meeting the expectations of the kitchen so they were in the process of starting a new batch.  Which would take an hour.  :( While our friends were disappointed, we did give serious props to the kitchen for not serving sub-par food.  So we ordered the Bomboloni instead.  Which were \"the bomb!\"  One of the best parts of the meal, though, was the little surprise Luis presented us with at the end of our meal... to again apologize for the souffl\u00e9 flop, he went next door to D.O.C.G. and got us a dish of the salted caramel budino.  Seriously, that was a little bit of heaven in a bowl (another 'wanna lick the bowl' moment).  Luis and the rest of the staff were fantastic, and we felt like they bent over backwards to make sure we had a fantastic experience.\n\nOh yeah... and we had a great view of the Bellagio fountains while we ate.  We waddled out of there fat 'n' happy, and found the pricing to be quite reasonable.  Especially for Vegas.  \n\nWe will be back to Scarpetta, without a doubt."

The brussel sprouts were meh. The lamb ragu was good but the agnolotti and ravioli were amazing!

That being said, being sat at a window overlooking the Bellagio fountain show is a nice view to see (no matter how many times you have seen it.)\n\nThe server (Joe) was nice, funny, and informative.  He knew how to sell without selling.\n\nFirst off, bread.  With a place called Scarpetta, you should expect great bread... which they have.  One of them has salami in it, and I was happy just eating that.  The bread came with olive oil, a tomato chutney-like sauce, and a pesto.  All were great, but the olive oil blew me away.  I enjoyed it so much, I bought a bottle.\n\nAppetizers, I got the \"creamy polenta\" which turned out to be the creamiest polenta I have ever had.  It was served with mushrooms and was amazing.  My date had the roasted sea scallops.  The service size was a tad on the small size, but she seemed to enjoy it nonetheless.\n\nOnto the Entrees.  I'm a Food Network addict, and saw Scarpetta while ago on \"Best thing I ever ate\" where they talked about the Spagetti with Tomatoes and Basil.  I had it, and it was good.  It wasn't the best pasta dish I have ever had, but a solid 8/10.  The pasta is fresh, and had a great texture to it.  The sauce was heavy on the basil (a good thing,) and there wasn't a ton of it weighing down the dish.  Next time I go, I'll try something different.\n\nMy date had the Duck and Foie Gras Ravoli.  She seemed to be very much enjoying it, and let me have a bite.  I then understood why Scott Conant is looked at as this great master of Italian cooking.  This dish was outstanding.  I might just get this next time I go.\n\nLastly came dessert.  I was informed there was no Tiramisu on the menu (my favorite Italian desert,) so we looked at the menu.  Our server recommended the Coconut Panna Cotta.  My date got that, and I got the Crispy Sweet Risotto Crepes.\n\nThe only downside to the meal, I would have to say is the Risotto Crepes.  It isn't that they were bad, it is just that they were more like Taquitos than crepes.  They were little rolled and fried pieces of batter with a sweet risotto in the middle of them.  For the amazing meal we had up to that point, it was a letdown.\n\nMy date's Panna Cotta, however, was fantastic.  It had that light and fresh taste that you want after eating a lot of pasta.\n\nI will definitely be going back, I'll just get the Ravioli and Panna Cotta instead."

The reservations were easy to come by as it was a Monday night and the place was not too busy.\n\nThe food was solid.  Started with the yellowtail appetizer that was simple and refreshing.  The secondi was the short rib agnolotti.  This was by far the best dish of the night.  Plentiful, tasty and the texture was superb.  The primi was the veal chop which was a good size portion but the quality left a little to be desired.\n\nThe service was off for a slow night.  They didn't have the scotch that the wife ordered so they default brought Macallan 12 saying that it tasted like the one we had ordered.  Also, my agnolotti came way after the others were served, they had forgotten it, but they comped the dish, so I guess that was ok.  There was just some general confusion here and there about who ordered what.\n\nAll in all, it was ok.  Over-priced for what it is."

When I mentioned I was vegetarian, I was provided with a special vegetarian menu, with a couple of additional items not on the regular menu. (this is not exactly a positive. Put all your dishes on the menu. I mean, you aren't actually starting to cook your farro for the farro risotto when a random vegetarian offers it, right?)\n\nI was drawn to the restaurant by the marketing copy. (it's impressive!) The burrata salad made me add it to my very short -must-try-while-in-Vegas list. And it did not disappoint. I have a running pet peeve about chintzy servings of burrata, and this is possibly the first place I've eaten that provided a balanced proportion of tomato and burrata. The variety of heirloom tomatoes, served roasted, and fresh, was a wonderful surprise. And there was enough burrata (lightly salted with shaved crystal salt) for every bite of the dish. Divine.\n\nTwo other stellar standouts (aside from the view of the Bellagio fountain show) were the olive oil served with the table bread-- some of the best I've ever had-- and the dessert. We split the Bomboloni, and it was divine. My description will not do it justice, but I'll try. Essentially, 5 small donuts covered in crystal sugar, and filled with Nutella, served with a heavenly banana gelato.\n\nAll that, and in a peaceful oasis of a casino hotel that barely forces you to cross the casino floor, and makes it easy to enter and leave the building. I'll be back, should I find myself in Vegas ever again."

I initially thought it was an extension of the DOCG Enoteca, which is next door.  Once you reach the main seating area you will find a nicely decorated dining room that features views of the Bellagio fountains in one direction, and their extensive wine cellar in the opposite direction.\n\nMenu - 4.5:  Great menu with very creative options.  The portions are small and the staff is really good about helping ensure you get the right amount of food.  Of course, as with many fine dining experiences you will pay for it if you are a big eater.\n\nService - 3:  The service was mixed.  The sommelier was fantastic; he really knew the vast wine collection and helped us find something that paired well with our group's diverse menu choices.  Our waiter, while very friendly, was just way too slow.  It took too long for everything from taking our order to getting our food.   Food delivery timing was off as one member of our group ended up watching everyone else eat while he waited.  I will say that it didn't appear that the other people in the restaurant were having the same experience.  I really think that our experience was out of the norm for some reason.  While I can't in good conscience rate the service experience any higher than 3, I would note that in my experience an establishment with a reputation for good service will usually do things to make amends when they don't deliver.  The restaurant recognized that things had not gone well for our table and took a few items off of our bill to compensate.\n\nFood - 5:  The food was fantastic.  Especially liked the creamy truffle polenta.   \n\nWine List - 5:  The 3,000+ bottle cellar offered plenty of choices.  The sommelier was very knowledgeable, friendly, and didn't make me feel like an idiot.  \n\nOverall - 4"

We shared everything and they split it all for us which was nice. The polenta with truffled mushrooms was Amazing I could have done without sharing this dish! The duck foie gras ravioli was rich and savory. The only dish was did not care for was the oratta which was a fish dish with a tomato based sauce. The fish was too fishy tasting for my liking and just overall lacked in flavor. The coconut panna cotta we got for dessert was delicious and I am still thinking about it! Definitely need to come back and try the spaghetti!"

Unfortunately the service at this location is so disappointing.  Our greeting was frazzled and rushed, our seat was lovely looking at the fountains nice and private. Our server from first greeting had an awful attitude-rather snotty really and never shared his name. Our food was absolutely perfect but our overall experience was ruined by lack of service here. I specifically said I would like wine with my dinner as my last experience in Miami was heightened by the perfectly selected glass of wine by the charming sommelier.  Here our glasses were left empty our entire meal!  My husband had finished his cocktail before the appetizer!  When dinner arrived we were over half finished before our server asked if everything was fine.  Clearly this was disappointing which then caused us to decide to not have another drink nor coffee and dessert as we had hoped.  When we asked for the check the server asked if there was something wrong which was frustrating and we chose to not bother as it seemed that could be confrontational. \nAgain, our food was perfect it was just a completely different feel than expected-one I would not want to repeat."

Full of passion and enthusiasm for his food, we were truly excited for our dishes. Being that we had a party of 5, he removed our menu's from our hands and told us that the chef would be preparing something fantastic for us. We ended up with small plates of 4 courses: starting with appetizers, pasta (duck fois gras ravioli, linguini with black truffle, their famed spagetti); a branzino and meat affair for the 3rd course (Sicilian spiced duck breast, and seared scallops...plus many more items (I believe it was 5 plates for each course) for party to share, which was fantastic! \n\nHands down, best Italian meal that I've had in years. I will be back very soon. Ciao!"

The host was very accomodating but we had to wait 30-45mins for a table... not that big of a deal but I was starving! Ambience is nice, could be very romantic. However, we were seated right under the ac vent and it was fuhreezingggg\n\n- Braised Short Rib - the beef was soo tender and flavorful. I definitely recommend this as an appetizer. The risotto was good in texture, however wasn't too crazy about the vegetable medley they had in there.\n\n- Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti - I liked this pasta the best (of what I tried). It just seemed weird that the agnolotti seemed to be cut in half, is that normal? In any case, rich in flavor, the short rib was good and went well with the sauce.\n\n- Ravioli - I can't find it on their menu online.. but it was delicious and had burst of great truffle flavor. Very creamy though and not sure I would be able to eat a whole entree of this myself. But definitely worth a try for anyone who isn't scared of cream & cheese!\n\nOh yea, and the house bread... BOMB. So goood. Each slice was like a surprise, either with basil(?) or bacon and served with butter (of course), olive oil, and a bruschetta type spread that was very fresh and light.\n\nOverall, very happy with the experience -- but it could also be because i was super hangry :)"

We are big fans of the spaghetti in Miami and wanted to see if it would be the same.\n\nWho would have thought that an unassuming spaghetti dish would be so amazing?  It doesn't even have any meat in it and it is so good!  I get my own because I don't like to share it.  If you want to try other things, it's great to split because it is very rich....cheese and cream, and butter...oh my!   The bread is delish, especially the stromboli, love the accoutrements, olive oil, mascarpone butter, eggplant spread. The heirloom tomato salad is always a good stand by as well.  We had the scallop appetizer this time, and it was very good.  We never really have room for dessert, and had to catch a show, so we passed. Maybe next time we will try the panna cotta.\n\nAll in all, I still love the Miami location better. The service is pretty consistent with both locations, just a different slightly more relaxed vibe in Miami.  Besides, who can beat a view of the ocean and the sleek, modern, nautical decor of Scarpetta Miami."

Very tasty, creamy but not greasy or tasting too heavy! \n\nTheir STRAWBERRY SOUFFLE was another sweet surprise! We were a bit hesitated about getting this one as we thought it's some gelato on it. But we didn't regret after we got it! It's not too sweet but just the right amount of sweetness. The souffle is so soft and puffy. Love it! Will definitely go back again next time we in Vegas!"

Which was a mistake. Service was painfully slow. My burrata was good but tagliatelle was just meh. Same mixed experience for the rest of the group.

The greeter/hostess at the door wasn't overly warm but I can get over that usually if the food and ambiance is good.  \n\nWe could only get a 6 pm seating on a Thursday (and I booked a week ahead) so I thought that was a good sign.  When we got there it was EMPTY.  We got a great seat by the window.   It started to fill up during our seating.  We got a fantastic basket of breads and spreads almost right away.  The best bread I have ever had in a restaurant bar none.  I could go either way on bread before a meal, but this was outstanding.  \n\nMy wife got the Tagliatelle which was light, yet filling enough for her to be full enough so I could play clean up at the end.  It was fantastic.  I had the duck and foie gras ravioli.  WOW.  Had a wonderful balsamic like reduction on.  They don't wow you with portion sizes, but I did not think one \"boy am I getting ripped off here.\"  Honestly the last thing I like doing is wasting food and in Vegas I don't want to be walking around with a to go box after a meal.  I'd say it was perfect portion sizes for the dollar.  \n\nThe service was superb.  Almost too good.   We were in and out in an hour which was a little disappointing because we had a great seat in the place.  But that is the business.  Turn over.  I will say we didn't linger either as it was our first night in las vegas.  \n\nDefinitely Recommended for people who want more from their pasta than the Olive Garden has to offer."

We didn't have reservations so we weren't sure what was going to happen, but we got a corner seat for two. There's a dining room with views of the water show that we can kind of see from our seats. \n\nMy husband wasn't that hungry because we made the mistake of eating at a buffet earlier, so we didn't get an appetizer. I did get some red wine and so didn't my husband. They served us bread to start and it wasn't just any bread bowl, it was freshly baked bread and they were all delicious! I could have just eaten the bread and be happy about it. \n\nSo we finally ordered and I got the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti, it was topped with panko bread crumbs for a nice change of texture. I loved it. It was also very filling! I was really uncomfortable afterwards because of the buffet earlier. My husband got the gnocchis with foam, it didn't have flavor to the foam, just for presentation, I guess. \n\nWe didn't have room for dessert, but we'll come back and have it some time soon. It lost a star because we were seated in the corner there because we didn't have reservations, or so we were told. People who walked in and said they didn't have reservations were able to be seated in the dining room. Please be consistent about it. You can tell us \"the dining room is currently full, you can wait for it to open up or we can seat you now in the corner, which would you prefer?\" Instead, they just made the assumption and seated us. Took away from the experience a bit, I'll be honest.\n\nI posted the photos on my instagram and Chef Scott Conant liked it!!! Then I posted a photo of him liking my photo and he LIKED THAT! yay!!!

I will admit the waiter suggested I get it medium and I opted for medium-well, maybe my mistake here - but the fact the meat had quite a bit of fat on it and gristle was NOT my fault.\n\nAmadei Chocolate Cake Toasted Almond Gelato & Salted Caramel Sauce - The cake was very rich and I was pleased with it, however I felt as though it was something that could be served up at an Applebee's for goodness sake, not a fine dining establishment.\n\nOn to the even worse (because the food was actually okay) was the service. Our waiter was horrid. Just absolutely, down-right inattentive and spaced out beyond belief. He was an older gentlemen. Mistakes made:\n\n- Incredibly slow service\n- Offering us a wine menu, but not taking our wine order until we gave it to him ourselves\n- The wine took forever to arrive and in the mean time he did not return to take our meal orders\n- Had tap water poured into our water cups that were filled with the water we PAID FOR\n- He did a poor-ass job of describing the meals, as did the others serving us\n- Just the most bland service EVER; did not ask us how our food was, did not chat with us at all, just did not care in general\n\nWas it because we were there on the RW Menu? Maybe. And if that is the way an establishment runs a wonderful event for a good cause for a charity than I have absolutely no intention of ever returning to order off the menu. There are better places I can go in Vegas to have fine Italian dining. Scarpetta is not one of them."

My wife was really wanting to try Scott Conant's iconic and so simple spaghetti after seeing it on The Best Thing I Ever Ate once on Food Network.  We had done the Steakhouse thing already and were ready for some Italian anyway.  We are SOOOO glad we came to Scarpetta.  Every bit of the meal was fabulous from the stiff cocktails to the impeccable service and the just unbelievably tasty food.  Honey's spaghetti was all she could hope for and my Branzino was a masterpiece, perfectly seared, with the most delicious fish stock based sauce that was poured over it table side. My brother had a seared duck dish and my niece some pumpkin-based filled pasta dish.  Throw in that we had a fabulous view of the Bellagio fountains blasting every 15 minutes and just, wow!\n\nTo a person, we all agreed Scarpetta exceeded our expectations!!!"

Our group of four shared several appetizers, entrees and deserts, but none were memorable.  Portion sizes were very small, and way over priced.  Of the starters, the thimble of steak tartare was tasty, but was only served with three slivers of garlic toast, so one of us got short changed.  The oysters and polenta were mediocre at best.  Our entrees included the signature tomato and basil spaghetti, a short rib filled pasta, and a carbonara style squid ink pasta that was very bland.  None of the main dishes were served very hot, and cooled quickly as we transferred them to our plates.  The deserts were undoubtedly the best part of the meal. The lava style chocolate cake, and the sugar coated donuts were a hit.  The cheesecake had a sour aftertaste.  Service was excellent at Scarpetta, as we were attended to by a flurry of servers.  Unfortunately, good service is not enough to bring me back next time.  If you are in Vegas and want to try a new restaurant, go somewhere else, but stop by the Cosmopolitan to check out the hotel and enjoy a drink in one of the many beautiful lounges."

The bill was super pricey, but it was worth every penny.  We would go back in a heartbeat!\n\nDimly lit and super chic, this place fits right into the Cosmopolitan!  We were seated right next to a window that overlooks the Bellagio fountains.  We got to enjoy the show a few times during our dinner, absolutely beautiful.  The only eye sore is that down below are the \"hidden\" extra plants, dirt, etc that the surrounding resorts use.\n\nA basket of five different types of bread is served with citrus olive oil, mascarpone butter, and eggplant/olive/tomato spread.  These were all absolutely amazing and they brought us another basket of bread for our meal.  This was a nice, unexpected treat!\n\nFor our primi piatti, we ordered the creamy polenta. It is usually served in a large bowl to share among the table, but they separated it for us.  The taste was so luxurious.  I could have made this my entire meal--I would highly recommend it!\n\nFor our entrees, my husband ordered their spaghetti.  This is one of their most well known dishes and it did not disappoint.  The best spaghetti I've ever tasted, hands down.  I ordered the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli and it was perfection.  The ravioli practically melted in your mouth.  I would definitely recommend both of these options!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Strawberry Souffle served with vanilla gelato & berries.  The best souffle I've ever had.  My husband, who isn't a sweets person, said it might be the best thing he has ever tasted.  This is a big deal coming from him.  \n\nIt was an amazing evening and this dinner was a huge part of it.  The only reason I didn't give the restaurant a 5 star review, is because I found a piece of bone in my ravioli that hurt my tooth.  When you are paying for a fancy dinner like that, you don't expect these types of things to happen.  Regardless of that slip-up, it was amazing and I'm already craving it again!"

Our server was professional, attentive, and extremely knowledgeable about the menu and gave some great pasta recommendations...and it didn't hurt that the pastas, for once, were actually big enough for a person to have as an entree. I went with the sheep milk ricotta agnolotti with truffles and parmesan (TO DIE FOR!), but the real hit at our table was the lobster pici.\n\nIt's always the little touches that push a restaurant into 5-star territory for me, and at Scarpetta, it was our fantastic server bringing us a free tiramisu (also to die for...and I don't even like tiramisu!) for bringing one of our dishes out a tad late, and a plate of Italian cookies with a chocolate \"Congratulations\" message on the plate after finding out that one of us was getting married. If I can get a table, this is an absolute must-visit every time I go to Vegas!"

You're going to feel the portions are small, and you may not appreciate the things that make this restaurant extraordinary.\n\nFirst, price -- be prepared. WIth a first and second course, without alcohol or dessert, it's easily $40 to $50 per person. I enjoyed a glass of wine and the famous spaghetti, and my meal was $46. The wine was over priced -- Scarpetta should compare its wine pricing per glass to other similar restaurants in Vegas, and I think they would find that they are a bit too high. $15-17 per glass is a bit much.\n\nSecond quality -- The bread basket alone was incredible. I swore that I would have only one piece, but I could not resist the hot stramboli with proscuitto and cheese, and the salted butter spread was amazing. The spaghetti also was extraordinary. It is a simple dish with tomato and basil only, but the flavors combined with the thick homemade pasta made the dish memorable. It is one of the few dishes I've had where I felt that the fresh and homemade nature of the pasta really made a difference.\n\nFinally--the view. It is one of the best in Vegas, overlooking Bellagio and the Bellagio fountains. The dark woods, the view, the candle lit room -- a wonderful place for a romantic dinner. If I'd only had a date. :)"

The lighting was perfectly dim. Not too dim you can't even see your hands like some other places. \n\nThe food, the wine, desserts, service is top notch.  Wine was perfect temperature according to one of our diners.

(Hey you know this was cooked for a long time, I'm not a chef so I don't know this but the taste had a lot of levels to it) Roasted Sea Scallops that I want to eat forever. Biggest surprise was the Spaghetti. I've never had this pasta before.  It was thicker, definitely cooked right and the sauce was heavenly. We had to order 2 plates of it.  Agnalotti which had guess what in it? I don't know. It doesn't matter, it was terrific.  Everyone picked on my plate when I ordered that one. Then for dinner Black Cod which was cooked to perfection. I'm in love. Where's the heart icon here on Yelp?  \n\nFor dessert, we ordered everything they had and the waiter wrote \"happy birthday\" on my plate with chocolate souffle.

We started off with the orgasmic Raw Yellowtail as an appetizer. As an entree i had Stracci which was pasta with lobster, crab, shrimp and basil breadcrumbs. It was very light yet flavorful. The ambiance was quiet and intimate, perfect for a romantic dinner and conversation. The service was not memorable not extremely attentive. It was just okay, but the view, ambiance, and food outweigh the lack of service."

I was so excited!\n\nWe ordered the yellowtail carpaccio and the octopus to share. Although both were good, it lacked the wow factor I was expecting from a restaurant of this caliber. The pink salt on the yellowtail was a nice touch but was missing a lot of the acid I usually like with my fish. In other words it was quite bland. The octopus was nothing to write about. We opted not to get the famous spaghetti because another pasta dish caught my eye which in retrospect was probably a mistake. But, how can you turn down squid ink linguine with lobster? This dish was decent, not great. There was a lack of sauce altogether. The squid ink although pleasing to the eye, was too mild in flavor for my liking. For the main entree we got the black cod and the branzino. The cod was delicious. I loved the flaky buttery meat and the roasted tomatoes which gave this dish some Italian flair. The Branzino was overly rich and neither of my girlfriends finished the dish. \n\nMaybe this place was too hyped up for me.  It was a huge let down. The ambiance was quite nice, dark and sexy. But we did not get a window table with a view of the fountains as I had requested. Probably wont be trying the one in NY"

            "review": "I had wanted to dine at Scarpetta since I first laid eyes on Scott Conant via Chopped. The man is downright foxy. My favorite food happens to be pasta too, so clearly it was meant to be. \n\nLocated in the swanky Cosmopolitan hotel, the first thing you see are cascades of chandeliers and purple backlights throughout the main floor. The restaurant itself is dimly lit with lots of stone and dark accents creating a chic yet inviting space. \n\nI suggest making reservations (we did so through Open Table) and also be sure to ask for a window table if available. Those have a clear view of the strip and Bellagio fountains. Sadly they were all taken the night we went, but they sat us as close as they could so we still had a nice view from our seats. \n\nThey start your meal off with a complimentary bread basket, and we enjoyed the variety of it. There was sourdough, a rosemary focaccia, I believe a wheat of some kind, and two which were stuffed with goodness including pesto and cheese. Spread on some mascarpone butter or dunk in the citrus olive oil and it completely elevates it to another level. \n\nMy husband couldn't help himself and ordered another after we devoured it. They obliged, but seemed surprised by the request. I'm guessing not many people ask for refills. We are carb people, what can we say? \n\nI knew ahead of time I would be ordering the $24 plate of tomato and basil spaghetti, and it was worth every penny. I'm almost certain I read he doesn't use cream in the sauce, but he sure fooled me because it was deliciously silky. When they set our plates down they removed a lid which had sealed in steam to keep the pasta fresh, and the aroma automatically made us salivate. It was the sexiest plate of pasta I had ever seen and tasted in my life. \n\nMy husband opted for a vegetable pasta which came dressed in a luxurious truffle zabaglione. When it comes to Italian food he almost always picks a meat dish over pasta, but he ate every last bite. \n\nOur dinner was simply impeccable. My expectations were well exceeded and I cannot wait to make a return visit. The staff are wonderfully hospitable and helped make our evening that much more enjoyable."

            "review": "While perusing menus for a special dinner in Vegas, I quickly narrowed it to Scarpetta because of their robust vegetarian offerings (both on the regular menu and then an additional veggie menu) and price point. It is less than some of the fanciest restaurants on The Strip and I can now confirm that the food is equally as good.\n\nAmbiance- We chose Scarpetta without even realizing until later that it was located in our hotel (The Cosmopolitan). For as loud as the hotel can be right outside the restaurant, the inside was quiet, calm and classy. The hostess mentioned that we were sitting at her favorite table and we could see why. Our two top overlooked the Bellagio fountain and the strip. It was great. The tables were far enough apart that we didn't feel too close to other diners.\n\nFood- I read a lot about Scott Conant's famous spaghetti 'baseball,' so we had to try it. Our waiter managed our expectations by explaining that the simplicity of the sauce, herbs and fresh made pasta made it delicious. We split all our dishes and this one was easy to share, as they gave us each our own tiny little ball of pasta. It's not a stretch to say that it is in fact, the best spaghetti I have ever tasted. The consistency was perfect and flavors well-balanced. I can assure you I would never spend over $20 on spaghetti anywhere else, but I'd probably do it again at Scarpetta.\n\nI had my eye on a few meat or fish dishes, but honestly the veggie menu easily tempted this carnivore away. I started with the tuna susci (sushi) and it was some of the best I've had. Each piece almost melted in my mouth and the flavors melded nicely together. I was truly sad when it ended.\n\nMy girlfriend had the polenta and we both agreed that it was the creamiest we've ever tasted, without being overly rich. And add truffles to anything and each bite turns into heaven. \n\nWe accompanied our spaghetti with another pasta dish off the vegetarian menu, the agnolotti. This was easily my girlfriend's favorite, as each dumpling was filled with (and covered by) the right amount of cheese, cream and truffle. Our meal ended with three warm and perfectly textured zeppole (tiny donuts) and vanilla almond dipping sauce.\n\nThe wine pairs were delicious and pours were generous. Our server was down to earth, perfectly attentive (but not overly) and mindful of our needs (both relative to food and time so we could make our show). \n\nIt is unusual for me to return to restaurants in Vegas, as there are so many good ones, but Scarpetta will be my exception. The combination of excellent food, service and price make this one of my new favorite dining haunts."

I saw that there were still a few time slots for around 6pm left on Open Table, so I didn't bother to make another appointment when we decided to just go there. \n\nWe showed up around 6:15pm and asked to be seated in the dining room.

I kindly told her that I had a reservation, but cancelled it because I saw that there were still many time slots left. She just looked at me and started walking us to a table. (This was kind of strange haha).\n\nThe bread that was given to start was amazing. There were 5 different kinds of bread and 3 sauces: citrus olive oil, eggplant tapenade and mascarpone cheese butter. I had to get two orders of the eggplant tapenade...so good.\n\nOur server Roberto was extremely helpful with helping us looking over the menu and to order. \n\nFor our appetizer we ordered the Mediterranean Octopus which was very tender. For our pasta we ordered the famous Tomato and Basil Spaghetti. It was cooked perfectly al dente. I would have to say it was the best spaghetti that I've ever had. I'm pretty much drooling thinking about it right now..\n\nFor our entrees I ordered the Fennel Dusted Black Cod and my boyfriend ordered the Filet Mignon. He had ordered medium rare, but they served it to him as medium well. I told him to tell our one of the employees (Julio) to send it back. Julio was very accommodating and made sure that my boyfriend received the second steak cooked perfectly the way he wanted. \n\nRoberto even included a Coconut Panna Cotta on the house for dessert because of their mistake with the steak. It was so good!!\n\nI just wanted to give a big shout out to Roberto and Julio for making our first time experience at Scarpetta amazing, even if we had to send back my boyfriend's steak. The Tomato Basil Spaghetti was the highlight dish of the night. We will surely return to Scarpetta whenever we are in Vegas again!"

I don't hate Italian food but it is not something that I am a big fan of. But I loved the Italian food here at Scarpetta! I think I had the best pasta in my life here! I tried different Italian places in the past that made homemade fresh pasta, but they aren't as good as the homemade pasta here at Scarpetta! I am impressed! I had the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti, it tasted great!\n My husband's veal ragu fettuccine was awesome too. We loved them a lot. At the end, I had a strawberry souffle and my husband's had a dessert that I don't remember the exact name. From my memory, his dessert tasted good and had an interesting presentation. Anyway, my souffle was awesome, I think it was the best I had by far, better than what I had in other French restaurants in the past (e.g. Andres, Eiffel). Everything was awesome. We became a fan. Highly recommend this place to yelpers!\nAt the end, they also gave us some sweet treats for our anniversary. Those tasted good too!"

We were being a pain to the waiter because we were all undecided by the wines there, but he was patient and I enjoyed their Riesling selection. They have lots of Duck dishes which is not what you'd expect out of an Italian place, but everything is very delicious. If this is your first time, try out the Spaghetti. Sounds plain, but it is really good."

Chocolate cake with gelato and Carmel sauce. Out of this world. My husband enjoyed dessert as well which looked like doughnuts filled with Nutella. The food was so delicious we wanted to come back, however they close down for 10 days prior to the holiday season. Our waiter was so kind as to give us a tour of the restaurant dining room that overlooked the Bellagio fountains. They also have 2 private rooms. One for events and another that is the chefs table. We got a tour of the kitchen which is impressive and impeccable. The exterior doesn't do the size of the restaurant justice. It's full scale and top notch. Our waiter recommended the pasta for next time, since we already had eaten prior to our visit. Due to their Holiday closing, we took his advice and tried the DOCG next door which was amazing. Next time we find ourselves in Vegas we will definitely eat here and if possible reserve the chefs table."

This location is a bit tricky to locate as it is tucked in a corner near Jose Andreas' place and next to D.O.C.G Enoteca.  The atmosphere is romantically dark and narrow but once past the bar, the floor to ceiling glass provides a spectacular view of the Bellagio Fountains.  If you are on a date, request to be seated next to the windows as all tables against the glass are two tops.\n\nService and Food were outstanding.  Although the spaghetti seemed to be the rave on Yelp and on tv, I thought it was good but not the best I've had.  My personal favorite was the truffle mushroom polenta!!  Highly recommend this dish.  The Apple glazed pork chop is also worth mentioning and it was slightly better than Wolfgang Puck's.  The roast chicken gets high marks especially the sauce that accompanied (chicken liver, onion and shallots)!  We ended the meal on desserts of Nutella & Vanilla custard filled bombolinis and the coconut souffl\u00e9.  Nothing was left on our plates.  It was the best meal during our Vegas weekend."

Other guests wanted the tasting menu, sure!\n\nI'm super glad we went with this. We got to try so many amazing dishes. I admit I couldn't move after dinner, and that doesn't happen often, but it was well worth it!!!  Others got the wine pairing and thought it was awesome. \n\n1. Start with the bread. Maybe the best bread basket I've had.  The salami and cheese bread was delicious. I could've just had that for my meal. \n2. Duo of yellowtail and tuna. Raw fish is not my favorite but I cleared the plate. This was delish. There was so much flavor. It was light and clean and tasty.  Yellowtail had pocketed red onion.  Tuna had avocado crema, pickled peppers, Granny Smith apples, and crispy quinoa. \n3. Fritto. I do wanted to try this and we got a bonus dish!  It was delicious. There was even lightly fried lemons with the veggies and seafood. \n4. The diver scallops was tender and delish with the mushrooms and blood orange. \n5. The polenta was another off menu bonus. So many people loved this, so happy I got to try it. Mixed with truffles, it was good. \n6. Spaghetti. Tomato & basil. I ate it all. It was as good as I hoped. \n7. Short rib agnolotti. A star. Very tender short rib. Very rich.  Brown butter. Horseradish. Toasted breadcrumbs. \n8. Fennel dusted black cod. I ate it all. Asparagus. Mushroom. Enough said. \n9. Spiced duck breast. I don't eat a lot of duck but this was good. \n10. We got the coconut souffl\u00e9 instead of the chocolate cake. It was a late change and the souffl\u00e9 was very liquid. Not sure if this is normal or not. It was good but I prefer it more cakey. Lemongrass gelato was good too. Note they did up charge for this.  $5 when on menu it's $4 more.\n\nMy fav were the duo of yellowtail and tuna, spaghetti, fritto, and the bread basket!!!\n\nService was good. \n\nWow. There was a view of the Bellagio fountains throughout dinner. That was amazing too!\n\nI'm full just thinking about this meal. Highly recommend!"

Marc Maron interviewed Scott Conent (who I have seen on TV a number of times) and talked about the spaghetti dish and how he could not believe how good it was. Well it is VERY good. My mom hadn't been feeling great prior to our trip so I think  she didn't really absorb how good the meal was. I had a special appetizer that had Octopus and lentils which was really good. We had a table near the window and were able to see the Bellagio Fountains. Mom had scallops-she said they were good. The spaghetti was really out of this world. Every time one has fresh pasta I think you are reminded that no matter how skilled a cook someone is if it is dry in a box-it is dry in a box. This clearly had been made day of and the tomato sauce, was flavorful and the pasta wasn't drowning in it.\n\nWe had the ricotta cheesecake which was a small round serving (different than other places) with some fruit sauce."

We had no room and were too close to the next couple so I decided we should just go to Scarpetta instead. The d\u00e9cor is absolutely beautiful! We sat at a table by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains and it was stunning. So far happy with my decision. \n\nWe had the short ribs and the tuna susci appetizer. The short ribs were good but nothing about them stood out as amazing. The risotto that came with them was just ok. The tuna appetizer was out of this world. The marinated veggies that came with were just so delicious and they went so well with the thinly sliced tuna. \n\nFor our entrees, my husband had the NY strip and I had the Orata. The steak was seasoned perfectly and it was very good. The Orata was somewhat different from what I expected. It is a very light dish so if you are watching your waistline, I would recommend it. The fish was cooked well and wasn't dry at all, just lacking some seasoning in my opinion. The tomato based broth was also a little bland but overall it was a good dish. We also ordered the glazed carrots to go along with our meal. OMG, I couldn't stop eating these even after I was full. They were so good!! \n\nOverall a great dining experience. I would like to go back and try some pasta next time. I also thought the service was excellent and the staff was very welcoming."

            "review": "The final meal of our Vegas escapade was well spent at Scarpetta. It wasn't completely perfect but most of the night made up for the little missteps (we'll get to that later) so for the most part, I had nothing but a good time. Attentive service, rich indulgent food, all housed within an intimate space with gorgeous views of the Ballagio fountains, we closed our trip in pure hedonistic style.\n\nWe started with some of their signature cocktails as we browsed the menu. Upon the recommendation from our fantastic server, and the joys of libation, we decided on the tasting menu ($99) and accompanying wine pairing ($49) since several of the dishes that we wanted to try were on it anyway and boy did we pick right. That was the beginning of six courses of pure pleasure.\n\nWe started with a sashimi plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=YvhgCFf5CQSIopYC83uWwA) which consisted of yellowtail with a drizzle of ginger oil and red onions. The other half of the plate sat the tuna susci - tuna wrapped marinated vegetables. The fish was so fresh and the flavors were delicately balanced. The bread basket came shortly after and there was a nice selection including yummy foccacia and stromboli. As part of the tasting menu, the chef also threw in a couple of surprises and we were treated to a delightful seafood fritto misto for this course. Perfectly crispy fried but not oily, every bite was yummy and the rock shrimp just melted in my mouth.  \n\nThe next course was a perfectly roasted sea scallop. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=06QYvnXBie8HfTnYKN4OBw) It was a joy to eat and the velvety salmoriglio sauce was a nice accompaniment to the sweet and juicy scallop. The chef's extra this course was a polenta with a truffle mushroom stew. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=gtRWGpR4xggHmw0rVryaNw) For the record I hate cornmeal and thus hate grits, tamales, and polenta. Yet, I could not stop eating this polenta. The flavors of the mushroom stew combine with the impeccably smooth polenta. (I suspect there's a whole lot more butter in it than what Chef Scott Conant lets on) It was a nice double headliner with the scallop. \n\nNext up was the pasta course and Chef Conant's signature tomato & basil spaghetti. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=JQRLJQ4G8BgIzxS0bC8Bow) Fresh made pasta in a simple tomato basil (+ quarter stick of butter) sauce but just perfectly executed. While I thoroughly enjoyed it, the chef's extra this course, the short rib agnolotti with brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=wzfcOlEkTVylois628h_Ag), totally blew my mind. Wow who would have thought that the combination of short ribs, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs could be so sublime? I miss it already as I speak. \n\nThe next course was the black cod. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=2TmOcEavT5T4aeu8J6ItRA) Again perfectly seared but wonderfully moist in the middle. The fatty fish absolutely stands out against the sauce and caramelized fennel. Delicious. The next entree course was a the duck breast. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=BR1FRH72URaVJtrhiq6w-A) While this was my least favorite dish of the night, it was still absolutely delicious which tells you the quality of the food all night. The orange and spices (I kept picking up 5 spice) worked well with gamy duck. All in all, a successful combination. \n\nFinal course and dessert was a chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and caramel. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=uDi5aPZQgQwUQcGjVUkoSg) This is where I really had to throw in the towel after all that eating. The chocolate cake was really rich and decadent and I could only finish half of it but I just couldn't let the toasted almond gelato go to waste. It was just delicious. You can totally taste the toasted flavor. \n\nNow on to the kink of the night. Since we were seated by the wine cellar, the sommelier came by several times to retrieve bottles of wine. Each single time, he let the door hit me as I was eating without even acknowledging it, much less apologize. Not that it was a deal breaker but you expect a little more basic courtesy especially when you're dropping good money on dinner. \n\nStill for a wonderfully decadent meal paired with friendly and attentive service, we had a good time and I strongly recommend Scarpetta if you want to treat yourself to a fine meal on the strip."

We love all the Cosmo restaurants, and decided to try Scarpetta, as we had out of town guests, and we had been wanting to try.  We knew we would not be disappointed - boy were we wrong!   I really was on the edge on how to rate this restaurant, 2 or 3 stars, as the while the food was good, the service was awful.  The server was very friendly, however, and this is why I opted for 3.\n\nFirst the positive.  The food was excellent.  All 6 of us in the party loved our food.  The desserts also were fabulous.   No complaint at all there.\n\nThe problem was the service.  The server was very friendly, but too many issues.  First, we got our cocktails, and after a few minutes, he took our order.  We did not order first courses, however our order was out virtually instantly.  We hadn't even half finished our drinks.  We had planned to order a couple of bottles of wine with dinner, however we never got the chance, and more importantly, our server never asked.\n\nWorse yet, he came by a bit after we got our food,and while walking asked if everything was okay.  We said that it was, and before we could even asked for more drinks, he was gone.  2 of the 6 drinks at the table were totally empty, and he never asked, and still worse, he NEVER CAME BACK.  Our drinks sat empty for 75% of the dinner, and even when he ordered dessert, he did not ask if we wanted coffee or anything else to drink!!!!  It was almost unbelievable.\n\nIt's not like he was that busy, as I had a clear view of the waiter station, and he spent quite a bit of time just standing there, watching the dining room.  Obviously not our table, however.\n\nUnless I start to hear some very positive reviews from friends, we will not be back."

Plus, it's in the beautiful Cosmopolitan, with all its glitz and glamour :) The restaurant itself is on the top floor with all the other eateries, including STK, Jaleo, Secret Pizza, etc.\n\nAs for the food, we had mixed reviews at our table. I had the duck and foie gras ravioli which was a nice light dish. Had a hint of sourness that I'm assuming was from the marsala reduction? I actually enjoyed my friend's short rib agnolotti much better. It had great flavors, the pasta was perfect, where the entire meal would have a nice texture to it and then suddenly melt into short rib goodness. The tagliatelle was OK, not a particular favorite.\n\nOverall, the ambiance was excellent. A bit on the dimmer side with their vintage lights. They had many private booths, creating an intimate setting."

Luckily, they were flexible on our arrival time with the reservation, but I guess it wasn't totally full anyway even though it was a Friday night. \n\nThe warm  bread basket was a nice way to start: \n- Broccoli strombili: broccoli raab and cheese in bread \n- Salami stromboli: better flavor with the fatty meat\n- Ciabatta: doughy \n- Focaccia: good olive oil flavor\n\nThese came with mascarpone butter (very subtle), lemon olive oil (nice), and an eggplant caponata, which I liked.\n\nPastas: \n- Short rib agnolotti: better with some extra cheese. The first few bites were good, but it got pretty monotonous, and I wish they had a smaller portion of this. It was pretty rich\n- Tagliatelle: with lots of vegetables. guanciale, and a truffle zabaglione. I wasn't expecting much from this dish, but the textures and the flavors turned out to be really good\n\nSides: \n- Mushrooms: a pretty good portion, slightly oily, but good flavor \n- Cauliflower: I liked the gremolata on top, and it actually went well with the agnolitti since the pasta was so rich\n\nWe tried ordering some cocktails, but most were pretty unremarkable, and they definitely weren't the craft cocktails I was hoping for.  Food came out shockingly quickly, and I actually wish they had slowed it down a bit rather than bringing it all at once, since things got cold. \n\nThe view of the Bellagio fountains at night was beautiful (we got a seat by the window)..  While the food was not bad, it wasn't as great as I expected, and I doubt the Vegas version does the original Scarpetta justice."

The best part of our meal were the appetizers- we had the butter poached lobster chestnut and parsnip soup and the creamy polenta. The flavours on both soup and polenta were amazing. The lobster was cooked perfectly and I love the toasted almonds in there. The polenta was so smooth and the truffle flavour was present but not overwhelming.  We also really enjoyed the complimentary breads and tapenade. One of the best tapenade I have ever had. Perfect with the bread. \nEntree is where they loose one star. My husband and I shared a veggie tagliatelli. The noodle was cooked perfect but the sauce was too salty. We also had 3 sides- mushroom medley, cauliflowers and butternut squash. The squash was too sweet and could have been roasted a bit more. The raisin and pine nuts in the cauliflower had a clash of flavours. The mushrooms were good but nothing too special. I was expecting something a little outside of the box than just saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Overall a great experience!"

But the wifey thinks of everything and yes I know I'm lucky and yes I tell her frequently.\n\nWe ordered:\nBread Basket - Wow!  GREAT START!  \n\nCreamy Polenta - Magical buttery love potion.  Add to anything to make it better.  You can put this on cardboard and enjoy.\n\nRoasted Sea Scallops - Cooked to utter perfection.  Texture was great.  Had a hint of fish to it but I loved it.\n\nDuck and Foie Gras Ravioli - Although I have an extreme love of Foie Gras, this dish was just okay for me.  The texture and temperature of the Ravioli didn't mesh well with the Foie and it just clashed.  I had high hopes for this one.\n\nSpaghetti - This was supposed to be my highlight.  I even went online and made this dish based on raves I've heard about it.  I have to say I wasn't impressed.  The spaghetti noodles were too thick and didn't have that homemade taste or texture to it.  It was served too cold for my taste as well.  Maybe the size of our group affected my experience here.  VERY SAD MOMENT when it hit my palette.  I probably should have asked them to redo it but the vodka had already soaked in and my enthusiasm was curbed.\n\nBlack Cod - Just a fish on a dish.  Flavors were okay but this didn't do much for me at all.\n\nMy worst fears had materialized.  The moment when you start so fast in the direction of brilliance just to be let down along the way.  I wouldn't say it was a complete let down as the dishes were all pretty well put together, however, that's all it was.  Great shit thrown on a plate...I didn't feel inspired...I wasn't brought anywhere...I was just at a restaurant in Vegas eating with my hot wife and a group of great friends.  It would have made the night perfection if the experience matched the bill.\n\n*Thanks wifey for the extremely thought-filled dinner plan - You're loved*"

Bottom line: We were DISAPPOINTED.\n\nWe arrived early and I approached the Hostess area to let them know the 5 of us would have a drink at the bar prior to dinning. I did request a specific type of booth that would accommodate the us facing the Bellagio. She barely spoke to me and had an attitude as if we were lucky to dine in her establishment. She did accommodate us but her attitude had us very DISAPPOINTED. \n\nThe wine list is extensive and has some great varieties. We ordered a bottle for the 5 of us. I noticed other patrons had some special chips at the other end of the bar. None for us? Not from the bartender. After waiting 10-15 minutes I had to walk over to the other side of the bar and get them myself. I then (Jokingly) told the bartender how good the chips were and he said, \"Yes-aren't they!\" Very DISAPPOINTED.\n\nThe dinning room is beautiful and we had a wonderful server, Titus. He was knowledgeable and professional. He was a bright spot during the evening. Our group had the endive & apple salad and braised short ribs for starters. They were very good and we highly recommend both.\n\nFor our mains we had the spaghetti with tomato and basil (somewhat DISAPPOINTED) halibut (wonderful) and the rib eye (very DISAPPOINTED). Our friend ordered the rib eye medium and it came out very rare. He returned it for more fire and it came our perfectly. The problem was that we ate our mains without him and he then consumed his as we watched him. Very DISAPPOINTED.\n\nI ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert. It tasted very ordinary and seemed as though it may have been frozen.  I know you can't compare any souffle to Eiffel Tower Restaurant but I'm surprised they served a tasteless dessert here. Very DISAPPOINTED.\n\nThere are so many fantastic restaurants in Vegas. There were some bright spots but we will not return. We were DISAPPOINTED."

The most flavorful item we had was the side dish of homemade pasta. That is a sad statement considering that is a side dish on a fairly robust menu. I personally had the duck and while it was cooked properly it was just a very tough piece of meat. I truly wanted to like this place, but being raised Italian I would call it Italian only by name.

Perfect.\n\nWe started with the roasted scallops ($17) which is 2 scallops with porcini mushrooms and sunchokes.  It came with some sort of sauce that was unidentifiable.  The flavor of the sauce just didn't come through and was overpowered by the mushrooms and sunchokes.  Still the scallops, mushrooms, and sunchokes were all perfectly cooked and tasty.\n\nNext I tried the Orata Rosso ($33), which is red snapper that comes with tomatoes, chard, and clams (out of the shell).  So yummy!  My husband had the halibut ($30), which came with potatoes.  An interesting combination but really tasty.\n\nThe show stealer was the lobster pasta ($35).  Black farfelle with lobster and basil bread crumbs.  Excellent flavor combination, texture, everything.  Black farfelle is kind of interesting to look at, too.\n\nFor dessert, we had the peach crostada ($11) - kind of like a peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream and blackberries.  Very good.  We also had the zeppoles ($11), which are beignets stuffed with nutella and covered in chocolate with a very yummy vanilla sauce.  Our latte and cappucino ($6 each) were also very good.\n\nWe had a couple glasses of wine which were good.  Pinot Grigio ($10) and Falanghina ($16).  The wine list is a little confusing because they list some wines by the glass and others as quartinos.  But the quartinos are not any larger than a normal glass of wine.

Our wine choice-a Meursault  went very well with our meal.\nFor our appetizers:\nTUNA 'SUSCI'\nmarinated vegetables & preserved truffles -never had fresher tuna, \nCREAMY POLENTA\nfricassee of truffled mushrooms- just perfect, creamy and the fricassee was richly flavorful. \nEntrees:\nMEDITERRANEAN BRANZINO\nshrimp, clams, mussels & celery root - crispy and sophisticated yet simply delicious\nSHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI\nbrown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumbs- perfect \nDessert:\nSTRAWBERRY SOUFFLE\nrhubarb compote & vanilla gelato-so light and satisfying, absolutely no sharing of this dessert. \nMy only disappointment was a side of the fingerling potatoes. They weren't bad but didn't live up to the level of the other dishes we had. \nWe are pleased to learn that they have a Scarpetta in NYC. This restaurant warrants many more visits."

Even the bread (with the variety of spreads) will knock your socks off. Just make sure to save room for the actual entrees...\n\nThe duck and foie gras ravioli is their signature dish and reasonably so. It's amazing. Delicate and refined is probably the best way to describe it. \n\nColorado Lamb was amazing. The lamb was not gamey at all and the different components of the dish worked in harmony. I will admit that I still like the Colorado Lamb from Stage restaurant in Honolulu...\n\nI remember one of my friends having a really delicious pasta (mint infused?) but I can't remember all the details regarding it. I just remembered it was heavenly. \n\nStrawberry souffle was amazing. Light, aromatic, and slightly sweet. It blew my socks off and definitely put Maison Akira's souffle to shame. \n\nZeppole are AHH-MAYYY-ZIING. Deep fried dough nuggets (so light and airy!) filled with a rich nutella center. Even if you're full, you need to get these...or you will regret it forever. \n\nDefinitely a great place to hit up for a bite to eat when you're in Vegas. I definitely will be returning during my next trip!"

Such a great experience that I actually ate here three times  Amazing service, I mean just stellar, the staff was polite and attentive. \n\nThey accommodated a large party of 12 for us in a private room with just an hour notice. \n\nOnto the food: \n\nThe mushroom polenta was divine. I had it two nights in a row. Creamy rich yet not too heavy, not overly salted, and a great mushroom to sauce to polenta ratio. Honestly one of the best I've ever side dishes I've ever had.\n\nThe pasta... Where can you go wrong here, I tried three of the pastas, squid ink pasta with roe and seaweed was amazing. The combination of the three textures the unctuous earthiness mmmm!\nA simple pasta with marinara, handmade of course the sauce was buttery sweet lightly salted, and lastly my absolute favorite... \n\nThe short rib stuffed pasta. I seriously don't have words to describe this. It had a nice crunchy crumble on top, some fancy reduction drizzled evenly over every piece. Just delicious. Bite sized, al dente, at first I thought the portion was small at first sight but wow it was so filling.\n\nOn my next visit I went with a friend:\n\nApps included the Yellow tail crudo with a unique and delicious infused oil I believe. \n\nThe seafood fritto Misto which was good, but I will say it's the only thing I wouldn't get again. Fried lobster, calamari and crab I believe. It was good but too much and with everything else, I didn't want to waste any stomach space. \n\nThe Watermelon burrata salad ... Again speechless, I mean did they grow the watermelon here? It was so fresh, juicy, crisp, the tomatoes were clearly hand picked for us lol. It was just so fresh and refreshing a great palette cleanser, and duh burrata makes everything better. \n\nEntree: We split a bone in ribeye. They even chopped it up nicely into two portions, more than enough to share. Medium rare cooked to perfection, I got a photo of this one, you can tell it's high quality, rested well, and extremely juicy. \n\nPaired with a wine, selected by the manager, it was just a great combination. They know their stuff!\n\nNo room for dessert.\n\nOn my third visit (yes all in one trip) \n\nI came for the black cod, tuna \"susci\" and dessert. \n\nI put this black cod dish up there with Nobu! It was that good. I also felt dumb not realizing it was (sushi) a fun play on words ... (Whoops) another delicious raw appetizer. \n\nThe black cod had a caramelized onion fennel tomato topping. Cooked to perfection, flaky, buttery mmmm. I am bias as this is my favorite fish to eat. \n\nOnto dessert: I really really wanted the chocolate banana cake but ... I'm allergic to bananas so that was a no go but everyone around me had ordered it and it was highly recommended. \n\nI went with the Panna cotta, and I'm not typically a huge fan of Panna cotta due to my dislike for the texture, but man they nailed this one as well. Sweet but not toothache sweet. Smooth, dense ish. You gotta try it. Also it has a citrus pineapple caramelized fruit topping I believe. I forgot to get a photo of this one. \n\nLastly the decor: \n\nThe place is dark, classy, upscale, but they have a cool bar, and little private bar tables, great for any occasion honestly. The wine room had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains, and the main dining room was so comfortable, I didn't want to get up from the round booth. \n\nAll in all 5 stars, I'd eat here every day if I could. Many thanks to the staff, barterders, management Etc. \n\nSee you next time !!!"

As per usual in Vegas we were late after the show ( over 30 min) however they accommodated us very quickly on the Windows over looking the The fountains at Bellagio. The food was good, Italian, small plates. The desert was good and they had a good wine list. Pricy however it's Vegas.

Fortunately there was a fantastic bread basket with 3 types that kept us going.\n\nDrinks we got the Gallardo and San Remo. Gallardo was a nice appletini-ish drink and the San Remo was delicious.\n\nWe shared 3 dishes: the tuna+avocado and yellowtail to start. The tuna dish was more or less as expected with great quality fish and a nice garnish, also plentiful. The yellowtail came with 4 or 5 paper thin slices, also as expected served with a very subtle ginger/salt sauce. I was a little dissapointed with this given the quantity and quality.\n\nWe shared the branzino as an entree, which was incredible and served in a killer shellfish broth with small pieces of lobster, mussels, and potato. \n\nService was definitely a little slow for our table (others were being served quicker) but we weren't in a rush so it wasn't a big deal. \n\nOverall, 4/5 stars based on what we ordered for the price and the service, could easily be 5/5 based on other items so I'll return to try it out in the future."

Sounds typical, and honestly not terrifically unique, but it was done well. Perfectly ripe tomatoes with the creamiest burrata. Microgreens on top added just the right balance of herby bite.\n\nPastas:\nSPAGHETTI. HOLY MOLY. Who knew that some plain spaghetti could have such nuanced and delicious flavors. I looked up the recipe online as soon as I got back to my hotel because you know this is making an appearance ASAP at home.\n\nPici with pesto and lobster. Very solid. I don't think this is an attempt-at-home pasta. It was excellent though.\n\nShort rib agnolotti. Solid choice. Very flavorful.\n\nFor all the pastas, they were cooked PERFECTLY. Spaghetti really stole the show though.\n\nEntree:\nI had the fennel dusted cod. Honestly I was already getting pretty full by then... so I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I would have without the pasta binge. However, it was cooked perfectly and the first few bites were delectable. I actually couldn't finish because after our shared app and pastas, I was already getting full. The accompanying veg were also expertly cooked and paired well with the fatty fish.\n\nEveryone else opted for the duck, veal, and filet. Meat eaters I guess.\n\nDesserts:\nPANNA COTTA. This was the second recipe I researched as soon as I got home. I am SO EXCITED to make this. Hawaii is my favorite place on earth and this is just hawaii in your mouth. Silky, smooth, and perfect.  Coconut, guava... so so tasty.\n\nChocolate souffle. I'm not the biggest souffle fan, but even I can appreciate the technical skill and mastery that went into the baking of our souffle. It came with a spiced choco sauce and cookie dough bites and fancy buncha crunch. It was delicious, just not my favorite.\n\nI also had a perfectly crafted cappuccino. \n\nIn short.... can't wait to try the bev hills location."

            "review": "Atmosphere and view of the Bellagio fountain was amazing. However the food did not live up to the reviews on here. Granted people raved about the spaghetti - which I did not get. Why? Because I couldn't justify spending $24 on pasta with marinara sauce. Throw in a meatball or two and you would have had me sold. But my boyfriend makes some damn good spaghetti at home and it's free. So I decided to pass on that. Instead I went for the lobster with squid-ink farfalle (I think it was around $35) and was NOT impressed. The pasta was too undercooked and was almost chewy. Furthermore, it had garlic, tomatoes, and basil breadcrumbs. Sounds good right? For some reason it tasted horrible. I pushed most of it to the side and ate all the lobster.\n\nMy boyfriend had their bone-in ribeye special ($56) which was HUGE! Although the meat tasted like buttery goodness, he literally sliced almost half of it off because it was nothing but fat. And I'm not kidding - I'm talking a good half of his steak. After cutting all the fat off as well as separating the meat from the bone, we realized we should have ordered something else because there was almost nothing left. However, I will give the place props for some delicious horseradish scalloped potatoes. They were so good! \n\nAll in all, I thought for the price we paid, the food was way under par. I probably wouldn't go back to be honest. Sorry!"

            "review": "Ah Scarpetta. Restaurant of my all-time favorite judge on Chopped-Scott Conant, every episode I ever watched featuring Scott added a grain of sand on top of the ever growing mountain that was my dream of dining at Scarpetta. By the time I finally walked through those doors it was an Mount Kilimanjaro sized monstrosity of a dream. I was so giddy I took a picture with the frickin sign. I mean this was it! I was going to eat pasta the way it HAS to be sauced up and cooked, I was about to have a symphony of flavors dancing their way onto my modest palette opening my eyes to a culinary world that which I have never experienced in my 24 years. I was about to be blown away. \n\nWe're seated by the window with a nice view of the Bellagio water show. Oh things were going as I expected at this point. \n\nOur server was nice, in a very proper, sophisticated, would not smile more than a 3/4 grin, and maintained an impressive monotone demeanor kind of way that which you expect at such a dining establishment. Everything is going according to plan. \n\nWe order the short rib risotto appetizer to share and I decide to get the roasted chicken as my entree while my partner in crime got the so raved upon spaghetti. As we waited for our entree the bread basket came out. There was a variety of different breads some stuffed with salami and cheese, and others with spinach and garlic all served with olive oil, cheese spread, and olive tapenade. \n\nHoly crap. I ate this bread and thought oh my god this is it, this is what I've been missing. The flavor was bright and salty, the outside was crusty and chewy but the inside was tender and soft. Dip that into the olive oil and you're in heaven. I'm literally on cloud 9 at this point....\n\nOut comes the short rib risotto that they kindly split into two plates. \n\nFirst impression: Are we minions? I mean I know it's \"gourmet\", and I know we split it. But I kid you not when I tell you my portion was probably 2 tablespoons. IT'S OKAY THOUGH we're at SCARPETTA. I took a bite. The piece of short rib was juicy, soft, and boldly flavored. I liked it. The risotto was pretty good-the vegetables still had a nice crunch and it was a nice little bed for the short rib to sit on. Not blow my mind amazing, but good! Pretty good!\n\nOkay the entrees! We get our hot plates and gracefully decide to not mention the fact that both of our dishes combined could probably hide behind an IPhone 6 Plus. We couldn't risk ruining the moment. But after taking a bite of my Japanese raised chicken that had eaten nothing but the finest grains before being swiftly beheaded, and brined in an anise spiced mixture for days before arriving at my disposal....I realized something. It didn't taste good. In fact it didn't taste like anything. I could hear Scott ripping a contestant to shreds for making chicken thats dry and needs a sauce, vegetables that have no love, and an overall dish with nothing bringing it all together. How could this be the cooking of the man whose every critique I felt I could so passionately agree? \n\nAfter I had a bite of the spaghetti was when the depression truly set in. Not only was I excited to try this dish because of Scott's particular distaste for a mediocre bowl of pasta, but Ted Allen also picked the dish as the best thing he ever ate on Food Network's show as well. This dish had so much going for it. \n\nVerdict? So painstakingly ordinary. The sauce had nothing really special about it-it was a bland, under seasoned tomato sauce, and for being homemade the pasta didn't really have that chewy bite you'd expect. Oh let me also add that it was a 9 bite portion (we counted). \n\nNeedless to say we decided to skip dessert, and I the girl who pranced in Scarpetta walked out like a little girl whose mom lost her bunny rabbit because she wanted her to \"play\" outside. Oh wait...that was me too. \n\nScarpetta, you disappointed me-and for that I nominate Scott to the chopping block. I think I'll stick with Alex Guarnaschelli's opinions for now."

Scott Conant's famous restaurant overlooks the Bellagio fountains if you get a window seat, and has a wonderfully romantic but classic vibe. Not too loud, not too trendy, just elegant. I started with my favorite, a burrata and heirloom tomato salad with roasted eggplant which was quite a large portion and was very fresh. It needed to be considering what I was following it up with...Duck & Foie Gras ravioli. I know. Whenever out of CA right? Homemade pasta stuffed with melt in your mouth pockets of foie gras drizzled with a barolo reduction. I'd never had anything like it and probably never will and it was truly amazing and truly rich. I started with a cocktail that I don't remember the name of, but it was a usual concoction of my favorites, gin, basil, apple juice, and something else delicious and fresh. I wish I could remember more what Tristan had...he started with a fresh soup of some kind, pureed italian pea poured over veggies and hazelnuts I believe that he went nuts for. He also had a pasta (all homemade needless to say) with a lamb ragu. I'd absolutely go if you have the opportunity."

The waiter even had the kitchen split it onto two plates so my boyfriend and I could share.  It was delicious with white truffles in the middle and very well seasoned. My boyfriend ordered the black squid pasta with seafood because the reviews raved about it--it really wasn't that great.  It actually smelled and tasted a little overly fishy, but he was a good sport and ate it all.  I order the duck breast, and the duck was cooked perfectly.  The only suggestion I have is that the duck was cut VERY thick and there was not enough of the delicious orange glaze.  It was good, but not over the top amazing.  We were pretty full but ordered the strawberry shortcake for dessert---OMG AMAZING!  It definitely made up for the mediocre dinner. The service was really great, the dinner was blah, and the dessert was really good.  I would recommend this place, BUT I would not come here again.

This is the case with Scarpetta, Scott Conant's debut into the Las Vegas restaurant scene.  \n\nThe decor is understated and classy, in shades of black, white and gray.  A knowledgable and unpretentious waitstaff makes the experience all that much better, as they walk you through the menu.  A few tables along the wall rest next to big windows which overlook the neon shimmer of the strip below.  If you're coming here with a small group, definitley request one of these tables.  \n\nAdesso, il Cibo  (Now, the food)\n\nYellowtail Carpaccio -  Four paper-thin slices of yellowtail treated with fine olive oil and a bit of garlic.  High quality fish and a gentle hand made this appetizer balanced and elegant.\n\nWaygu Beef Tartare - Diced  Waygu beef treated in a similar fashion to the yellowtail, but with a more pronounced garlic note at the end.  Very straightforward and satisfying.\n\nSpaghetti Marinara - As many have said, this is the best spaghetti you will ever eat.  The housemade Al Dente spaghetti is toothsome and tender.  Somehow, the chefs here are able to pull the purest essence of tomato and basil out in this dish.  The simultaneous subtley and complexity of the flavor profile here is truly incredible.  I've spent a lot of time in Italy, and honestly cannot think of a spaghetti that holds a candle to this masterpiece.  A must order!\n\nBlack Mac n' Lobster - I believe the black color of the noodles comes from squid ink, but I could be mistaken.  Very nice flavors of lobster and the sea.  The texture was quite similar to the spaghetti, which I found to be redundant, but that was an error in my ordering, and nothing to do with the execution of the dish.  \n\nDuck and Foie Gras Ravioli w/ Marsala Reduction - The food that kings eat!  The ravioli was immaculate, formed with care and the love you'd expect from a homemade Italian meal.  I found the combination of duck, foie gras, and the marsala reduction to be a bit too heavy.  I could see people raving about this dish, but for me it was just too much of a good thing.\n\nBranzino - Gentle white fish with a lightly crisped skin and honest flavors.  One of the best cooked fish plates I can remember having.\n\nDry Aged Filet - The pink/gray color of this steak is visually contradictory to what you might find at a fine steak house, but that is due to the dry aging process.  It was tender, flavorful, and neat.\n\n\nYes the bread is incredible as well, but let's not fill up on bread.  Scarpetta is a great date spot if you're looking to splurge.  Do not leave without ordering the spaghetti, its the type of dish you'll tell your grandkids about."

Ugh! \n\nI ordered a gluten free pasta so gave them some room on how bad the entree tasted and looked but even my husband who is not picky could not eat his short rib pasta dish. It was so greasy. The service was bad too, we waited a very long time for a waiter to come up to us. He made a rude face about another bus boy that bumped into him. It is not a high end dining experience at all. \n\nWe were very disappointed."

The manager, Kelli, was very helpful on setting up a family style dinner and was amazing to work with. The food was delicious and the portions were very generous for a family style meal. We had 3 of their staff attending to our table. They even accommodated one of the guests who had celiac disease at the last minute! We had an amazing time here and would definitely come back!"

            "review": "After much research on where to dine for our five year wedding anniversary, my husband and I decided on Scarpetta. The menu looked delicious and the prices weren't outrageous. We called about three weeks in advance to make our reservation for seven people. I was surprised that they only had one time left but was very happy we were able to get in at 7:30pm. We were all super excited to dine there. I tweeted about it and they even tweeted back at me, which I thought was a nice touch. \n\nWe arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and only had to wait about five minutes for a table. We were hoping for a table by the window but didn't get one. We were near the wine wall but could still see the Bellagio fountains. \n\nI'll break this review into two parts.\n\nSERVICE:\nI'd never been to a higher end restaurant like this before, so I was expecting exceptional service like I had never previously received. While the service was very good, it didn't live up to my expectations. Our waiter was a really nice guy, but I think he might have been newer because he seemed a little bit awkward and shy. Also, I asked him to take a picture of our whole group and he forgot. Then two people had to leave so when he finally did take the pic, not everyone was there. There was another man (Paul?) who was in charge of the wine and he was another story. He was so suave and charming. I wish he could have been our waiter! There was a major glitch in our evening considering the type of place we were at. We receieved our bill, and as we were looking over it we realized they put two $125 bottles of wine on it rather than just the one. I'm glad we noticed, because that's a fairly big mistake to make. Service in general was on the slower side. There were many gaps where nobody came to our table. We were there for about two hours. The guy refilling the water glasses was really nice, though.\n\nFOOD:\nBetween the seven of us, we ordered:\n-Crispy fritto misto (x2)\n-Heirloom tomato salad\n-Creamy polenta\n-Tagliatelle (x2) (this is what I ordered)\n-Duck and foie gras ravioli\n-Spaghetti\n-Pea tortelli\n-I know I'm missing one, but I can't remember/obviously didn't try a bite.\n\nI had bites of everything and it was all delicious. Of course, the bread starter was fantastic. The polenta was great and rich. The ravioli was so rich, I wouldn't have been able to eat it as my main dish. It was also incredibly salty. It might be nice in a smaller size as a starter. The vegetables in my tagliatelle were super fresh - such a difference fresh veggies make! The spaghetti was very good, fresh and delicious, but it didn't knock my socks off like it has for some other people. Of all of the pastas I tried, I would order the pea tortelli next time. The portion sizes are not large, but just a nice amount to leave you satisfied and not bursting. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. Not as intimate as I wanted, but I think we would have had to spend more somewhere else for that. I was sort of surprised that there were a lot of skimpily dressed stagettes and dudes in t-shirts and BASEBALL HATS! \n\nWe had a very good experience here but it just fell a bit short of my expectations based on the many other reviews I read."

The bread basket and dippings that come with were so good I had to restrain myself from gobbling it all up too quickly. The cocktails were way better than expected too. I had the Scarpetta Cosmo since we were at the Cosmo. :)\n\nI think our favorite course might have been the ravioli and spaghetti? No, wait, definitely the creamy polenta. GET THE POLENTA. And the starter of tuna and yellowtail was phenomenal. There was also cod served and duck breast, which were both perfectly cooked and seasoned, but I was getting so full at that point that I gave up midway through the duck. The ending dessert was a rich dark chocolate cake with gelato. They switched out the flavor of gelato for my boyfriend due to a nut allergy and were really accommodating. And they gave us some kind of pineapple cream in lava soup? That tasted like it came straight from Hawaii and the man doesn't even like bits of fruit in his food but helped me eat all of this one.\n\nEverything was perfect! We left more full than we expected off of a tasting menu! Service was great and very informative."

            "review": "Warning, this beautiful restaurant is in the Cosmopolitan which is a pretentious somewhat tacky casino/hotel. Except for the hostess, who seemed a little  \"too cool\" for the guests, the staff gets an A+ for service. Titus was our main waiter but there were two other gentlemen who were on the spot and very kind.  We had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains as well. The warm bread basket with a variety of breads (foccacia, stromboli, etc) was served with a 3 different types of dips (an eggplant thing, olive oil, and butter) and they were all so delicious. We started our meals with a shared Beet salad and polenta. To say the polenta was AMAZING would not give it enough credit. It was creamy and consistent, topped with truffled mushrooms, garlic, and sauce. The serving was large enough to share. I could have had another serving of the polenta and been quite happy and full. The beet salad was crisp and came with a generous serving of gooey cheese (stracciatella), pumpkin seeds and balsamic dressing.  It was fresh and tasty.  My friend and I shared the Duck and foie Gras Ravioli and Short Rib Agnolotti. My friend loved the Ravioli and loved the marsala reduction. I felt the duck and foie gras had a weird texture and I didn't care much for it. But that could have been a mental thing since I have opinions about foie gras practices. The sauce was delicious however and perfect for dipping some bread into. I wasn't sure what to expect with the Short Rib. It was small rib pieces in noodle wrapping covered with breadcrumbs (?), brown butter and horseradish. Whoa the horseradish was strong but so delicious! If I hadn't filled up with polenta and bread, I could have finished my plate. It was so delicious. But if you find horseradish to be strong or can only tolerate a little, skip this meal! There wasn't any room for the dessert. But the options looked tempting. Oh I forgot we had Moscato de' Asti that complimented the meal throughout. The price seemed fair for the quality and service. One of the most delicious meals I have ever had."

I look to Yelp on a daily basis but have never felt as compelled to leave a review as I do about our experience at Scarpetta...spoiler alert: this could get lengthy! \n\nMy boyfriend and I were taking a mini vacation to Vegas and did extensive research on restaurants, as we wanted to treat ourselves to one night of fine dining while we were there. We found Scarpetta's Yelp listing and looked through every single photo and read a ton of reviews (even the not so great ones :( )and decided this was going to be our place! \n\nOur reservation was for 10p.m. but we arrived at around 9 and were told we could be accommodated immediately. I asked if there was any possibility of getting a window table, and apologized for not requesting it when we made our res. The extremely nice hostess told us that wouldn't be a problem at all and after waiting, maybe 2 minutes tops, we were taken to our table. They weren't kidding about the view by the window! The view was gorgeous and we were looking right out at the Bellagio water show(s).  The lighting IS very dark, but for us that made it even more romantic, which was the exact experience we were hoping for. \n\nOur cocktails were EXCELLENT. I had a \"basic\" dirty martini with blue cheese olives and it was by far the best martini I've ever had.  Our server, Julian, even brought a tiny shot glass of extra olive juice just in case it was still too dry for my taste, but I didn't need it!  \n\nFor starters, we chose the Diver Scallops and the White Corn Soup. When they were brought to our table, the server mentioned they took it upon themselves to split the scallops for us so that \"we could each get the best of what the dish had to offer.\"  Julian made the excellent suggestion of combining the crispy pancetta with the rest of the dish's ingredients, rather than taste it on its own, as that was how the chef intended for it to be eaten.  He was SO right! What an absolutely delicious combination and just the perfect portion size.  The soup was served in one bowl for us to share, and once again, we were blown away. Just enough king crab to give it a bit of body, but still a light enough soup that we were able to enjoy it and be ready for more (so, so much more!)\n\nThey gave us the complimentary basket of warm fresh breads and again we were surprised because of the variety they provided! Even most nice restaurants will give you one or two selections, but here? 5 choices and then 3 options for spreads/ dipping. \n\nWe finished our amazing cocktails and decided to each get a glass of wine to compliment our meal.  As soon as the wine list was brought back to our table, a man came over and introduced himself as the sommelier and asked if he could suggest any wines to accompany our entrees.  I drink white and my boyfriend drinks red, and we got very different entrees, but the sommelier was extremely helpful and described the selections perfectly.  Naturally, we chose his suggestions! \n\nNow on to the entrees:  My boyfriend chose the duck ravioli and I went with the tagliatelle dish. Amazing, Amazing, Amazing! When I asked Julian to please give a bit more detail about the Tagliatelle entree, he described it as \"definitely more of a comfort meal\" and he couldn't have been more right.  The pasta was extremely fresh and even though the sauce itself was on the heavier side, it did not overwhelm the dish at all.  I'm not a fan of duck but my boyfriend could not say enough great things about his dish and the presentation was perfect! The sommelier stopped back after we sipped our wine for a bit and asked how the flavors were complimenting the dishes. He was just doing his job but made us feel important, none the less. \n\nDinner was cleared and we were so full but they hadn't let us down yet so we chose the Amedei chocolate cake. Heaven! Just enough of everything on the plate for you to enjoy it without setting yourself over the edge. \n\nI do apologize for the length of this review, but I felt that sharing this absolutely amazing experience was important for anyone that might be on the fence about trying this place! The ambiance was romantic, relaxing, and quiet with beautiful views- perfect for a date night.  The service was excellent.  When we choose to \"dine\" we like to sit and relax and enjoy  and not feel rushed and we were not disappointed here.  We never felt rushed nor did we feel neglected either.  They seemed to understand that we were there to enjoy ourselves and never made us feel like we were hanging around too long/ late.  The presentation of every single plate was perfection.  The food was some of the best we've ever had. I can definitely appreciate that restaurants can't be a \"10\" every single night, and things do sometimes happen, but our experience was outstanding and will definitely be somewhere we come back to the next time we're in town!!"

What surprised us was a little heat to the sauce - the server was also a little surprised to hear this ... to the point i don't think she believed us. \n\nThe polenta was extremely rich but dang good. the fricasse was better here than the mushrooms we had at comme ca and helped cut through some of the richness of the polenta. \n\nThe branzino was perfectly cooked, simple seasoning but great taste. nice. \n\nWe went with the amedei Chocolate cake ( basically a molton lava cake $11) with a toasted almond gelato and a salted caramel sauce ( the reason why we got it - $3) and then a separate scoop of tangerine sorbet. \n\nI tell ya, that tangerine was a heck of finish to our food fest - so frickin refreshing - I will go back for that every time i'm in the building !!"

But it's delicious and, besides, you're in Vegas so you clearly already hate money.  The atmosphere was relaxed, upscale and quiet, which may or may not be what you're looking for in a Vegas dinner.\n\nThe service is a bit of a different story.  On the one hand, there were periods when we couldn't get anyone's attention for minutes at a time.  On the other hand, our server was overattentive whenever he was at our table.  For instance, when we were ordering, after we placed our order he would offer commentary on each dish.  This might just be a pet peeve of mine, but if I've already decided on a dish, I don't need you to tell me that it \"appears small on the plate, but the filling and the reduction are actually quite rich, so I think you'll be satisfied.\"  Just say \"OK\" or nothing at all.\n\nTo start I ordered the yellowtail, which was incredible and I only wish there was more of it.  The sea salt was a really nice touch and I'm probably now going to be tempted to salt all of my sashimi going forward.\n\nFor my main, I had the duck and foie gras ravioli, which was similarly delicious (and enough food, I thought).

Yes, it is over-priced, but all Vegas restaurants are over-priced, so in my mind it's all relative.  I go into it from the beginning expecting to pay more, but I also expect the restaurant to hold up its end of the bargain and give me something that doesn't make me regret spending $100 a person.  Scarpetta definitely holds up its end of the bargain here, and now that I've addressed the price issue, I can write about the more interesting things!\n\nWe tried the short ribs for appetizer and spaghetti and branzino for entrees.  The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth juicy good.  I've never had freshly made spaghetti before, and it was amazing...now I can confidently say that I really understand al dente!  The branzino, which I typically find simply prepared in other Italian restaurants, had a very creative and delicious preparation.  It came as two filets (with crispy skin!) on top of a hodge-podge of seafood (baby shrimp and mussels) with some kind of seafood jus that is added at the table (interesting pink color, but very nice seafood flavor).  The mascarpone butter and citrus olive oil that accompanies the bread is delicious!  \n\nI tried a couple of cocktails, and the one that stands out the most to me was the Gallardo.  I was hesitant to try it because it included apple juice (which I don't enjoy), but the waiter assured me it didn't taste too apple-juicy and he was right!  It was flavored mostly by the basil and was so aromatic and fresh...perfect accompaniment to spaghetti!\n\nI think the most amazing part of the meal was the strawberry souffle.  I want to go back to Vegas just to have it again.  I can't even describe it.  Just get it and try different bites with the ice cream, rhubarb and the other sweet sauce it comes with...pure eating pleasure sensations.  We also had the bomboloni, which were very good, but at the end of the day just still  felt like donuts and weren't as special as some of the other items I tried.\n\nAs mentioned by many other reviewers here, the view over the Bellagio fountain is pretty sweet, and it is just so lovely right around sunset.  The interior ambiance of the restaurant is classy and fun.\n\nOn a side note, I am totally addicted to the show Chopped and love Scott Conant and was so happy his restaurant did not disappoint :)"

When we did get seated the view from our table was beautiful, we could see the water show that Bellagio does. Our waiter, can't remember his name was really attentive, asked us how we are doing, if there was anything else that he could get,  the staff kept our waters full AWESOME!! \nFood here is pretty good. We all had different dishes amongst the 12 girls in the group.. That's how we eat LOL. Sharing is caring. Over all great place, great atmosphere, nice people, modern interior, beautiful views."

You do walk through a rather long narrow bar area, but when you get to the main dining area, you will be impressed. Great views of the strip.  We were seated in a very private booth with floor to ceiling \"booth\" - it was intimate and allowed the 6 of us to really talk.  \n\nThe service - attentive.  Not overbearing, not pushing (i..e we weren't that hungry and didn't order apps).  The breadbasket - yummy!!!!! \n\nSeveral tried the black cod - delicous!! I had the duck - it was wonderful and cooked just right.  Portions are on the smaller side, so if you are hungry make certain you order an appetizer.  The entrees were mostly in the $30 range, though some a bit cheaper.\n\nThey brought a lovely molten chocolate lava cake thing for the birthday boy, which was really tasty.\n\nThe wine list is huge! Not cheap, but some good selections.\n\nOverall - certainly a place I would return."

The steak was cooked to my liking and just melted in my mouth! \n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is very romantic.We had a great table right near the window where we could see the Bellagio fountains and the whole strip was right underneath us.

The service felt disconnected - I would've removed 1 star because of that, but the food was so superb that I won't! We didn't have reservations because it was a last minute decision to dine there, but we were seated right away regardless.\n\nWe skipped appetizers and went straight for the entrees. My eyes went straight to the DUCK & FOIS GRAS RAVIOLI! My heart jumped for joy realizing that fois gras is completely legal to sell here! I ordered it and it was the right decision! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the savory filling had a creamy texture that was bursting with flavor. It was like the perfect marriage of poultry and red meat flavor. Definitely unforgettable! My husband enjoyed his TAGLIATELLE (with fall vegetables, truffle zabaglione & guanciale) - it was very comforting and hearty.\n\nWe were full, but were able to make room for dessert: NUTELLA AND VANILLA CREME BOMBOLONI which consisted of Nutella ganache, caramalized bananas & Nutella powder. WOW! The bomboloni (like donut holes) were lovely fluffy and crispy, filled with either chocolate or vanilla cream. The bananas were fantastic, as were the ganache and powder, adding decadent levels of texture.\n\nSo glad our impromptu evening of dining led us to Scarpetta. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

Beautiful Earth tones and a intoxicating view of the Bellagio fountains.\n\nScarpetta is one of those fancy restaurants with menu items that no one really knows how to pronounce; needless to say, I just ordered and hoped for the best. And the results we're favorable!\n\nI could mention what I ate/ordered, but this place doesn't offer a fixed menu. It's seasonal and changes because your quality freshness. Everything that was order was amazing. There's a bread basket... I could have kept eating that and been a happy camper. There were several variations, my favorite was the stramboli (not the American version - I asked the server what it was because it was slap yo' mama good!), it's a combination of fresh bread and meat. It was a joygasm to the mouth! The bread basket is served with a fancy whipped butter, a roasted eggplant dip, and olive oil. \n\nI order the yellow tail app (which they always have) and it did not disappoint. Fresh and tasty! I ordered a pasta dish (no idea what, who, where, why, yaddda, yadda, insert fancy words and culture here) and it was flavorful and light. The portion size was perfect. Not too much or too little. Seriously, I don't think you take doggy bags from places like that.\n\nWe ordered several desserts and they were all great and small enough to not get stuff and big enough to share.\n \nThey have an extensive wine list and it covers an entire length of a wall. It's a pretty sight.\n\nThe service was impeccable. Spot on. Courteous. Attentive.\n\nOverall, Scarpetta was de to the lish. If I could afford it, I would definitely go back in a minute! I yearn for you Stramboli. Definitely not your traditional Italian, but a great modern twist."

We had two guys waiting on us. I don't know if the main waiter was busy or they were training, but it was obvious the second guy was more junior. He was trying to avoid saying, 'I don't know'. For example we asked what the parts were in the lamb three ways dish. We were told chops, short rib, and one other part that I can't remember right now. The chops made sense. When I commented that short rib was usually beef he agreed. So I said 'the lamb three way includes beef (which I don't eat)?'  He said yes. This sounded weird to us so we asked the first waiter and got a completely different answer. The dish included chops, shoulder, and a third type, maybe shank or something. Ultimately we decided against the lamb so I can't tell you what was really in it. \n\nFor appetizers we got yellowtail. There was three of us and I believe the portion came with five pieces. Instead of giving us an extra piece to round it out, they gave us three pieces and kept two in the kitchen. That seemed odd so we questioned it. The junior waiter apologized and said the kitchen staff was new. Who knows!!\n\nThe yellowtail was good and an additional serving came out of the kitchen. \n\nWe knew we had to try a pasta dish here as they are all handmade and Scott Conant does Italian food so well. We had a few dietary restrictions at the table so we ordered the tagliatelle. We were told that it came with short rib, but it could be brought on the side since I didn't eat beef. The pasta arrived and it was delicious!!!! We were told the kitchen was figuring out the short rib for us. Guess what? It never arrived! I wasn't surprised at this given how everything else was going. In fact I knew we were being duped the minute the waiter said it. The pasta was so good on its own so we didn't miss it or bring it up, but it was another problem with the service. \n\nFor entrees two of us got the halibut and it was amazing! My husband got one of the two beef dishes. The waiters disagreed on which one was liked best by patrons, but there weren't any problems with the dishes coming out incomplete. \n\nFor dessert we got the bomboloni. Oooh they were divine!\n\nSo again, food was top notch. There was not one thing that we did not like. I'm hoping service was only off the night we went. We weren't put off by it. We were actually laughing at everything that happened. It's a must try restaurant in my books."

If you're going to pay $25 to $35 for a pasta dish, Scarpetta is the best place to do it.\n\nWe visited Scarpetta at 8 PM on a Thursday and sat at the bar until our table was ready. The bartender, Nicole, was a delight. She opened a bottle of Sauv Blanc for me since they did not serve any by the glass, and that's what I was looking for. I can always appreciate someone who goes above and beyond to make sure that the paying customer gets what they're looking for. The \"crack chips\" at the bar are highly addictive, don't even start...\n\nWe were seated shortly after taking a few sips of our drinks at the bar, near the window where we could see the Bellagio water fountain show. I was expecting the view to be more romantic and clear - there are beams and walls that are kind of in the way. Regardless, it's a very nice view (I just feel that they advertise it a bit differently than it actually is). The service was great and so pleasant. We ordered a braised short rib appetizer that was delicious, along with the spaghetti dish, pichi dish and the side of mushrooms. Everything was damn near perfect. I prefer my pasta a bit more cooked, but I can appreciate that the Scarpetta way is how it should be done, with hand made pasta, in house. The sauces are so amazing, the flavors are just perfect...\n\nWe didn't have any room for dessert but next time, I swear I will get into those bombolini nutella things, they were on every table and looked so good.\n\nThe ambiance is quiet and calm and it felt so good to get away from the chaos that is Vegas. I've eaten at many vegas restaurants and I feel that Scarpetta is perfect for a date and low key evening to enjoy one another's company and some GREAT italian food!"

Hell, we are from Philly but it's very filling before dinner.\nThe oysters were absolutely delicious!!! The best dish we ordered without a doubt!  \nOur waiter then expanded our table by lifting the sides on our square table making it a larger round table to make room for our entrees.  Unfortunately, on my side there was a huge glob of chewed gum that became visible when the waiter lifted my partition.  This was not my waiter's fault but it was still gross.  Of course, my waiter quickly worked on removing the gum but yuck! That's Vegas for you! \nMy husband and I both ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  Both dishes were warm not has hot has I like.  It was OK.  I'm kind of a pasta snob (Thanks Babbo)\nOur friends felt the same about their pasta dishes, it was OK  Not mind blowing.\nWe ordered two bottles of Cline wine - can't go wrong there!\nDessert was good but still not out of the park.\nOur bill for 4 people was about $800.  Now for 4 people in Vegas, this is the norm but this night, I don't think it was worth it.\nI know a lot of people LOVE this place, maybe it was just an off night."

The chef here definitely turns complicated Italian dishes to something very down-to-earth. My favorite dish of the night was the appetizer Scallops with Mushrooms.  The combination between the two was harmonious from taste to its texture.  My second favorite dish was Pancetta-wrapped veal loin.  I love veal, but I ordered this mainly for the side of sweetbread, peas and carrots.  I am HUGE on sweetbread since I have fallen in love with it at Animal in West LA.  Every since then, I have tried sweetbread whenever I see them on the menu, but this one was by far the WORST sweetbread side ever :(  The cripy frito misto appetizer was too salty and mushy.  Probably need higher heat to fry them...\n\nI would definitely come back here again and try other dishes.

This is a real must-have if you're dining here: we ordered 3 of these! The polenta melts in your mouth and greets you with a corny, sweet flavor. \n\nDUCK & FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI: I love Foie Gras so I already knew I'd enjoy this. The combination of duck & Foie Gras was perfect for the filling of the ravioli. \n\nTAGLIATELLE: My sister had this and rated it 4/5 stars. She's a diehard fan of truffles, but the summer truffle in this dish wasn't strong enough for her liking. \n\nSERVICE: The food came at a reasonable pace, not too fast or slow. Our waiter, Garvin, was very prompt and attentive, checking up on us every so often as a good server should. Overall, the service was flawless.\n\nDECOR: Classy, not disruptive, modern, and simple. I sat in front of the wine storage which I felt was a nice addition to the restaurant's ambiance. Last time I dined here, I had a decent view of the Bellagio water show, which is right out the window. \n\nIn conclusion, Scarpetta is a flawless restaurant.

The one notable exception was a rib cap (cap of the rib eye), which I have never seen on a menu. It was tender, perfectly cooked, and literally bursting with a rich, fatty, beefy flavor. \n\nService was top notch, though we were in a private room with dedicated wait staff.

            "review": "Fine dining at it's finest!\n\nCame here a Saturday night during my last trip to Vegas for a bachelorette party (apparently we weren't the only ones) and we were seated right in the middle on a long table which was nice for a party of 7 girls. Our waiter and busers were on point and our waiter was really nice and always conversated with us and made our experience fab!\n\nLet's talk about that bread basket...how crazy is it that they actually have salami in one of the breads. They also have sourdough and herb focaccia  . They have butter, olive oil and this roasted tomato eggplant as a spread to go with the variety of bread they give. I liked the herb focaccia bread the best with the butter...it was toasted and soft in a small square (good for portion size). For my meal I got the black cod with tomato's and fennel because I love butterfish and I only eat seafood and I love vegetables...although I was debating on getting this or the halibut, I'm glad I went with this because it was so divine! I wish the portion was bigger but it's one of those restaurants where it's quality over quantity. We ordered 2 whites and 1 bottle of reds that night, and because my stomach was not having it, I only drank a glass of the 1st bottle. Some of the girls ordered the lobster, scallop appetizers, split pea soup, foi Gras ravioli and steak and everyone said everything they ordered was great. For desserts we got the hazelnut mini donuts, strawberry cheesecake/shortcake in a cup dessert over a bed of crystallized sugar...I didn't get to try any of them but everything was all gone so it must've been delicious. \n\n\nOverall the ambiance is beautiful, food is amazing/drinks and bread, awesome service and fine dining at it's finest. The portions are a little small and the price is a little pricey but worth it especially when it's a special occasion like a birthday, anniversary, valentines day, mothers day or bachelorette dinner =)"

            "review": "Sat at the bar- waiter recommended the octopus salad off the regular menu as a light option. It was tasty- had beans similar to fava and a tasty hummus like paste under the octopus, which was likely pan seared. There were also some half sliced baby tomatoes and Brussels sprouts which were seasoned well. It was also happy hour, so I ordered the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti- it was completely delicious!!! It's very rich, close to being a little over oiled, but tastes amazing! They highly recommended the duck ravioli also, said its better but a little heavier. Will definitely order next time. The portion is half what the full dinner portion is, and I found it perfect. Most people could order 2 items off happy hour, which are $7 a piece, and feel satisfied as a meal- order 3 if you're really hungry. They had some cool specialty cocktails on HH all for $7 also, with two beers and their choice of a red and white wine. The best happy hour I've seen at Cosmo! Atmosphere is quaint and romantic. Excited to go back to try more options!"

It did not disappoint.\n\nThere were some nice-sounding appetizers on the menu, but we bypassed those in favor of ordering the day's pasta special as our starter.  it was linguini with truffle, and it was perfect.  Possibly the best pasta I've ever eaten.  Seriously, I wish I'd ordered that again as my meal.  And then maybe again as dessert.\n\nTable faves included the aged sirloin, the orata rossa, the scallops and the sunchokes.  The roasted baby carrots were also pretty great.  The spaghetti was fine, but, honestly, after that starter, it just couldn't compete.  The gingerbread-pear crisp was the fave dessert, though all were good.\n\nThe fave wine of the night was the super tuscan, though it was crazy with sediment (something I'm surprised they didn't notice before serving it)."

The texture of the bread was perfect. The bread basket came with various bread; Rosemary, cheese, white and etc. Rosemary bread was crispy and fluffy. Cheese one was chewy and flavorful. The  eggplant basil dipping sauce that came with it was incredible good. I even put some in the spaghetti.  \n\nAppetizer \n1. Scallop and Foie gras (3/5): I have to say I was not impressed by their foie gras. Scallop was not bad. Grilled pear was interesting though. Don't think I will order again.\n2: Creamy polenta(4:5): Ordered this dish because it's popular on yelp. The truffle mushroom that came on top made this dish absolutely delicious. I would prefer polenta was not so liquidity. \n3: Grilled Spanish octopus and squid (5/5): it was light and fresh. Love the smoked paprika vinaigrette and chickpea that came with it too. \n\nEntrees\n1. Spaghetti with Tomato and Basil(4/5): like other yelper said, they cook it al dente here. It was just simple and amazing. I added some eggplants from the dipping sauce :p.\n2. Duck and foie gras raviolis (3.8/5): it was tasty in general but I couldn't taste much flavor from duck or foie. Masala reduction and cheese saved the dish though. \n3. Short rib and bone marrow agnolotti(5/5): it was my favorite entree of the night. Toasted breadcrumbs and brown butter made this dish so heavenly. \n4. Branzino (3/5): my friend ordered this dish and he liked it. I tried a bite and it was too fishy for me.\n5. Lamb loin (4:5): I do not eat lamb but tried a bite from my friends plate and it was not gamy. Lamb lover should definitely give it a try. \n6. Pici (4/5): great flavor. The tarragon and chilled pesto made this dish very yummy although I wish I see more lobster.  \n\nDessert\nAll yummy across the board! \n1. Banana souffl\u00e9 (5/5): perfect amount of sweetness from the souffl\u00e9 although I'm not a fan of rum gelato. \n2. Coconut panna cotta (5/5): very interesting concept with the guava juice as they called it \"soup\".\n3. Citrus Parfait (5/5): very refreshing after the meal. It's like yuzu sorbet.  \n\nService was attentive but the service was not bit cold. I don't feel like our waiter was welcoming and patient enough. Feel like he's there to do his job and leave. No smiles either. Maybe he had a bad day. \n\nI will keep trying other Italian restaurants but I can see myself coming back frequently."

We came as a party of 5 to include my parents, 2 year old son and wife.\n\nWe came in and the hostess was less than friendly. She asked my name then took us to our table without a word. \n\nWe sat down and waited much too long for our waiter. This became a theme throughout the night. He finally came by and simply told us the daily special and asked what we wanted to drink. I've been to many upscale restaurants around the world, and this would be unacceptable at any of them. He didn't take any time to explain the menu, how people normally order, etc. \n\nThe menu was divided into courses which led me to believe people ordered many courses. However, with the price of each dish this would get prohibitively expensive quite quickly. I asked the waiter and pointed out that people ordered at most 2 dishes and that they were not family style. I'd expect the opposite with authentic Italian.\n\nThe drinks took FOREVER to come out, nearly being outpaced by our appetizers! We didn't order anything outrageous: 2 bourbons neat, 2 martinis and some milk. The bourbon list was one of the most extensive I've seen in a restaurant, mind you I just returned from 3 years in Japan. \n\nOur appetizers came out and were presented well. I ordered the creamy polenta into which the waiter scooped in fricasseed mushrooms. It had wonderful texture and taste; my wife hates polenta but loved it, even more than her butternut squash soup. It was ok, but had a Chinese five spice taste to it we found off putting. The bread and spreads were good and my dad enjoyed his Endive salad, despite the waiter giving it to my mom at first. Again, at this price point, unacceptable!\n\nFor the main course three of us ordered the spaghetti with tomato and basil and one got the short rib / bone marrow agnolotti. Both were mind blowing: must haves. \n\nTwo of us got chocolate souffl\u00e9 for dessert; I got the bombolonis and my mom got the panna cotta. The chocolate souffl\u00e9 had that nasty five spice flavor to it again. Gross! I was certainly not a fan. The bombolonis were a can't miss as they were filled with Nutella, although the banana gelato was an awkward pairing.  The panna cotta was wonderfully fruity and refreshing. My mom got the best dessert for sure. \n\nI would come back here for the spaghetti, panna cotta and bourbon list, and hopefully we'd get a better waiter."

I had requested to be seated by the windows overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and the table couldn't have been more romantic. We requested the Sommelier and he promptly came to our table and my gal and him found the perfect wine for us. I'm more of a vodka expert. For an appetizer we ordered some oysters, not sure where they were from, but they were smaller than normal yet very flavorful. My girlfriend and I split a couple entrees, the duck and foie gras ravioli and the Colorado lamb trio. The duck and foie gras ravioli was amazing! I know it's not cool to do that to ducks, but I was bit by a duck when I was young and I'm cool with it. Not too mention it was absolutely delicious! The Colorado lamb trio was another memorable entree with what I believe was a lollipop, cutlet and steak. I must say this was a very romantic meal with excellent service and mouth watering food.

I am an acquaintance of Chef Dan Rossi and he saw to it that we experienced Scarpetta to the fullest.  A huge thank you again to Chef Dan and his hospitality and talented team.\n\nThe atmosphere: Sleek, elegant, and sexy are the first words that come to mind.  The sound track puts you in the right mood but doesn't overwhelm.  One of the few hot spots in Vegas where you don't have to shout to your dinner companions- I greatly appreciated this.  It is warm and inviting with these great S shaped booths.  Yes, the waiters appear over your sholder when you're dining at the booths, but I didnt really mind that.\n\nThe food: I do not exagerate, one of the best meals of my life!\nA break down-\nPolenta with mushrooms- I could have drank that sauce and been satisfied, my bf who doesnt even like polenta went back for seconds and thirds!\nHeirloom tomato salad- simple, clean, delicious\nYellowtail carpaccio- i dont know how they get fish this fresh in Vegas! Light citrusy sauce with some crunch from the salt on top. Perfection.\nShort ribs- I dont usually eat meat but when i saw that these babies basically fall off the bone as soon as a fork comes near, i had to try.\n\nTaglietelle with veggies and truffle cream- this is not a light dish! The homemade pasta is cooked to a perfect al dente and the sauce is everything that something with truffles should be.  My bf's fave of the night.\nShort rib ravioli- a special that night.  Again, I'm vegetarian and this was my fave dish.  It its offered when you go, dont miss it.\n\nBranzino with leeks and asparagus- light and refreshing after the heavier pastas.  Crispy skin on the fish. Leeks roasted till they carmelized.  I could eat this every night and be a happy girl.\n\nGingerbread and pear tarte with cinnamon gelato- ORDER IT!!!!\n\nI'm not usually this long winded in reviews but I was just so happy with the entire evening.  In addition wines by the glass are generously poured and therefore worth the steep-ish price.  I'd recommend this as a place for couples, non-rowdy bday parties, and those looking for an elegant evening without a bass infused club sound track.\n\nThank you, thank you Chef Rossi."

We each paid about $60 for a shared appetizer, wine, pasta, and dessert and it was the perfect amount of food (full but not stuffed).

Finally I was getting to try this joint.  We were seated immediately upon arrival.  The restaurant is larger than I was expecting, and if it wasn't full, it was very close.  Lively atmosphere, almost loud, but not quite.  I wouldn't say it would be good for a romantic evening, but it was great for a night out with friends.\n\nOur server immediately approached us and presented us with an impressive wine list.  It may not be the best I've seen on the Strip, but it was well above average.  The prices are typical for a restaurant located in a higher end hotel on the Strip, so you might have some sticker shock.  We went with a barolo which was fantastic.  Service was great throughout the evening, no complaints at all.\n\nIn addition to the wine list, we were brought the bread basket.  This has various types of bread, but the one that stood out had bacon and cheese.  It tastes as good as it sounds.  I might try to steal some the next time I eat there to make a sandwich with it the next day, it was great.\n\nTo start, our table of 4 split 2 pastas:  the short rib agnolotti and the ricotta cavatelli with wild boar ragu and arugula.  The waiter advised that they were small dishes, so we went with 2 orders of the agnolotti.  Very glad we did, the amount we received was a perfect starter, but splitting the dishes among 4 would have been a stretch.  Both pastas were cooked to a perfect al dente.  Some of the best pasta I've had.  The short rib was very tender and flavorful, and the pasta to filling ratio was great.  Likewise, the wild boar ragu was incredible.  Rich and very deep flavors were seasoned perfectly.  I would be able to just eat a ton of this with a spoon, it was fantastic.  I'd even eat it cold.  \n\nTo eat, I went with the special of the evening:  veal osso bucco with risotto.  The veal shank was large and fork tender.  Full disclosure, a buddy of mine ordered this dish as well and his was NOT fork tender.  I saw him use a knife on more than one occasion throughout the meal.  Mine, however, was fantastic.  The meat was moist and melted in your mouth.  It's not the best osso bucco I've had, that honor still goes to the mighty Ferraro's, but it was an A dish for me.  The risotto was cooked well, but had a bit too much citrus for me.  But, I liked the dish enough to keep Scarpetta at 5 stars.\n\nThis place isn't cheap, but you can find a LOT higher prices on the Strip and the food you get won't be worth the additional cost.  I had a great deal of anticipation for eating at Scarpetta, and I was not let down.  I've found a new Italian place for my rotation next time I'm in town."

I hope it is good enough for you.\n\nOur waiter helped with the wine list and led us in the right direction.  Huge win, you shouldn't have to study beforehand to be able to order wine.\n\nThe bread is in fact good. But remember when you review a restaurant that knowing the bread is good is not actionable info.  Actually by knowing this I ordered a strong drink knowing the bread could save me, so good tip.\n\nThe appetizers we had were rich, interesting that all of them looked rich. Polenta was good.  Crab corn chowder was great because it came as a plate of just crab - where's the chowder? They pour it on right in front of you, that's where. Fun and effective, lots of nice flavors all stood out. The appetizers were big.\n\nSo then we tried the spaghetti because of the yelp reviews. It's tomato basil sauce on spaghetti. Everyone who raves about it is questionable. Have you ever had spaghetti with tomato basil sauce before? It is like that but over twenty dollars. Ours was super salty which I didn't like. This dish would be chopped for sure.\n\nWe had two fish dishes both were pretty good but the fennel black cod was the best, cooked just through.\n\nDessert was 5 huge doughnut balls and really surprised me. Simple and delicious. They were perfectly done. Not a thing wrong. Super satisfying. Service had ramped back up for dessert.\n\nThe setting is sweet. Windows overlooking the bellagio fountains. Cool looking wine cellar. Plan your visit to be there through sunset as the strip lights come on.  It had a comfortable relaxed atmosphere but still classy.  We had a lot of fun.  I'd go again."

I got an old fashion. I've been searching las vegas for the best old fashion and this place wasn't too bad. only thing lacking was a cherry\n\nFood: \n1) braised short ribs with root veggie and risotto- the risotto was a perfect pairing for this dish. it was super delish! if the meat was tender enough to cut with a fork i would say perfect. don't get me wrong it was still tender, but i think this dish would be PERFECT if it were just a tad more tender\n2) sushi slices- pass on the raw fish. save room for the other stuff (good and fresh but there is so much other stuff to try)\n\n3) roasted scallop- I'd have to say this was my fave of the night. i have a thing about scallops. they always seem to disappoint. but SW at the Wynn and Scarpetta have won me over with these amazing scallops. YUMMMMMM\n\n4) polenta with truffle mushroom- i love mushrooms and this went perfect with the polenta. it came in two separate pots that you would mix together. super fab. it seems like an odd side dish for the food but GET IT ANYWAY!\n\nPastas:\n5) spaghetti with tomato and basil- i wasn't impressed by this basic spaghetti that a lot of yelpers raved about. but the noodles were really good. home made noodles a little bit chewy and more dense than the standard spaghetti noodle you make at home\n6) duck and foie gras ravioli- i'm not a big fan of foie gras but everyone at the table loved this dish. they said it was the best pasta dish we got.\n7) stracci- lobster, crab, shrimp, and basil- this was my fav pasta dish. it was bursting with flavor. the shellfish was perfectly delicious. MUST TRY\n\n8) lamb- my goodness this was the best lamb i ever had. if i didn't know any better i wouldn't even have known i was eating lamb. there was almost zero gamey taste that is commonly associated with lamb. YUMMMMMM\n\ndessert:\nwe had about 4 desserts. but the best i think was the gingerbread pear crisp. get a little side of gelato/ice cream. it was so good. i was stuffed to the brim at this point but i had to have more!\n\nwe also had some fish but i would go with the other amazing food rather than the fish dish. would love to come back here. its quite expensive but also quite yummy. my tummy was more than satisfied when i left :)"

Didn't get asked at any point what so ever how I liked my food (it had no flavor by the way) so I had no choice, because of my hunger, but to bare that food rather than ask for a different one because there was no one to request it from.

THAT'S STRIKE THREE \n\nOVERALL, mediocre food, service was okay, for an expensive price.

The bread basket consisted of foccacia, strombolli with warm meat and cheese, bread with herb, basic rolls and sourdough. Delicious!  They were served with mascarpone butter spread, citrus olive oil and eggplant spread.\n\nOur server told us that they were best known for their spaghetti. Hmmm, must try that next time. For appetizer, we started with the raw yellowtail. \nFor our entrees, we ordered the duck foie gras ravioli  and prime NY steak.\nThe yellowtail was very tender and refreshing. Used of rock salt gave it a unique after taste. I only wish there was more of it since it only came with 4 pieces. \nThe duck and foie gras ravioli was alright.   I absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but I could barely taste the foie gras. The marsala reduction was a delightful contrast to the ravioli. \nThe steak was cooked to perfection. Medium rare, the way I like it. However, I can't say that it was the best I've ever had. Not even on my top three list.  It was served with seasonal vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes, roasted potatoes, wild mushrooms and parmigiano. We were told the  mushrooms were shitake , trumpet royale, beech, and pecorino mushroom. \n\nSince we were sharing everything, they were very accommodating by splitting everything for us.

For an entree, I had the veal chop which came with potato mash, green peas and sweetbreads.  It was cooked to perfection and a large portion (you always worry about portion size at rather expensive restaurants, or at least I do--the last thing I want to do is leave hungry).  My date had the pork chop, which came with vegetables and an apple compote, which he said was very good.  And for dessert we had a coconut panna cotta that had grilled pineapple and a papaya \"soup\".  It was light and a perfect way to end the meal.  Jason was great and he had recommendations on wine pairings and helped us pick out the delish dessert.  We had a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains as well, so that was beautiful.

There are five throughout the U.S. - New York, Miami, Las Vegas (in the Cosmopolitan), Toronto, and Beverly Hills. I first heard about Scarpetta from my boyfriend's sister, as we both like to watch Conant on Chopped on the Food Network. \n\nWe started the night off with two cocktails - Scarselli and Dolce Limone. Good, as always. They gave us complimentary bread: sourdough, french, rosemary, and a stromboli. Along with the bread were marscapone butter, eggplant and tomato-herb spread, and a citrus-infused olive oil. The stromboli was definitely the best, but the eggplant/tomato-herb spread was really good. As our appetizer, we chose the Tuna 'Susci' ($16), which as you can see is raw tuna wrapped around vegetables. The tart-marinated vegetables complimented the fresh tuna very well.\n\nAfter reading so many good things about the spaghetti, I had to find out if this is really the best pasta you will ever have. Usually, I am disappointed with certain dishes because people have hyped them up way too much. But for once, the spaghetti ($24) lived up to its hype. Wow, I honestly can't believe spaghetti could taste this good. The pasta is cooked to perfection - consistency, texture, taste - everything was on point. Then there's the sauce, ahhhhh. You can taste the fresh tomatos and the basil in every single bite. I am speechless, really.\n\nAlthough the spaghetti was definitely the highlight of the night, the duck and foie gras ravioli ($25) comes pretty close. Once again, the ravioli was cooked perfectly (as expected). But what really made this dish stand out was the filling. Duck - check. Foie Gras - check. Can you ask for anything more? Two of some of my favorite things to eat are mixed together and stuffed into a ravioli. It is the right amount of duck and the right amount of foie gras - not overpowering at all. The marsala reduction adds a nice and clean finishing touch to this already, perfect dish.\n\nAs for dessert, we opted for the chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce. The cake was just like every other molten chocolate cake, but the toasted almond gelato and the salted caramel sauce was goooooood. I wouldn't order it again, only because I would want to try their other desserts.\n\nFor two cocktails, a beer, an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert, our bill came out to be about $125. Not that bad considering all the food and drinks we got. The entrees may seem pricey (especially the spaghetti), but you actually get a good amount in one order. When I come back (hopefully soon), I would definitely get the spaghetti again. Everything else, I would switch out only so I can try other items on their menu. But if it is your first time going, I highly recommend the spaghetti and the ravioli. Then, you can also say you just had the best spaghetti in your entire life!"

It is one of my favorite places in LA and I figured I couldn't go wrong at their Las Vegas location.  They exceeded expectations.  I made reservations for 7 on opentable and due to a very long taxi line at our hotel we were running a bit late, I called them and they were kind to let me know that they would seat us when we arrive and not to worry.  Dinner was remarkable per usual as was the excellent service.  They were aware of our celebration and the staff made sure to congratulate our bride personally and with a desert! The waiter and his crew were extremely friendly and before we knew it 2 hrs had passed us by and we left happy and very full. I cant wait to go back!\n\nWhat we ordered:\nFarmer's Market Salad\nCrispy Fritto Misto \nCreamy Polenta - AMAZING\nRoasted Diver Scallops\nBraised Short Ribs of Beef\nSpaghetti - 4 out of 7 of us ordered this dish and all of us finished the entire bowl\nFettuccine  - If youre going to order the pasta dont be foolish order SPAGHETTI\nPrime Filet of Beef - amazing!\n\nThe drinks were also delicious! The lemon drop martini and shots especially."

The raviolis were under cooked and we definitely should have sent them back but that was our fault.  Everything else was really nice but my biggest complaint is that the polenta, ravioli and fillet all had the same demi glace. It was too rich after the second dish and my taste buds got totally bored.  For the price I would go else where."

            "review": "It was a nice modern style restaurant. The menu noted that the pasta was imported from a place called Scarpetta. (I'll look it up one of these days) The ambience was nice but however it might have been too dark and dim mainly because my eyes started to hurt after awhile. (*I ate with a large group. We were given a private room which was a bonus.)\n\nI ordered a Mediterranean Branzini (fish). It looked beautiful on the plate which is always nice. After taking one bite, I noticed that the skin was extremely crispy but unfortunately the fish came out a bit dry. The dish was really depended on the sauce for it to work for me. The dish was also served with thinly sliced leeks, two tiny shrimps, and two mussels. The shrimp and leeks were delicious but the mussel was a bit gritty. I'm not sure if that's really my thing but the flavor was good though. \n\nThis dish was worth a shot but I preferred the dishes that others in my party enjoyed such as short rib Agnalotti, Kobe beef, and some kind of chicken dish. The chicken that I sample was completely moist. I was very surprised and at the time was very jealous that I didn't ordered that instead.\n\nAnyways, there was a complimentary salami/cheese bread in the bread basket. I recommend it. Don't forget to try the creamy dessert of pana cotta and guava. It was very sweet, refreshing, and light."

It's right across the magnificent window to watch the fountain show at the Bellagio.\n\n$35 corkage fee. Not bad considering our party brought in a beautiful bottle of cab from Napa. Their adorable great grand master somm Noeh is the sweetest, nicest guy ever. He let us see his most prized bottle. He recommended a beautiful Amarone. Best value for a bottle of wine that's less than $200. Tell him the flavor profiles that you like and he will never steer you wrong.\n\nTitus and the gang (all the crew who helped us) are amazing. Don't like your drink? Tell them what you want. I can't stress that enough. If you know what you want, they'll give it to you. No clue as to what you want? Well don't blame them if you got something that's not good enough for you.\n\nTake your time and enjoy the experience that is Scarpetta. The staff is very courteous and genuine. Food? It's an italian place, so don't complain if the Hamachi isn't like Nobu's. Their agnolotti is divine. It's rich - and a little bit goes a long way.\n\nThink of quality vs quantity. Four appetizers, an entree each and 2 desserts should be an amazing dinner for a party of 5. The food is rich. You will get gustatory fatigue if you try and finish a bowl of pasta with bone marrow and octopus all by yourself. The trio of lamb is tender and well seasoned. Have little bites from everyone's plate. That's when you know that you came here with the right group of family/friends and you're ready to have a great dining experience.\n\nIn a rush? Skip this. This is not a fast food joint. Want a big slab of foie? You obviously won't find it in a ravioli."

The food was amazing, the service was phenomenal, and the atmosphere was absolutely gorgeous.\n\nI booked my reservation through Open Table. We showed up to our reservation roughly 15 minutes early. I gave the hostess my name and thus the amazing dining experience began.\n\nI started off asking my waiter what he would recommend for a cocktail that I couldn't get anywhere else. He immediately recommended a drink that had bourbon in it. I'm not a bourbon fan, but I decided that I should give it a try. I cent remember the name of the drink, but it was the first one on the list of specialty cocktails. What I experienced next can only be described as an orgasm in my mouth. It was absolutely amazing. \n\nMy dinner date and I shared two appetizers. We had the octopus, which was good but a bit flavorless, and the scallops. The scallops were unreal. Absolutely awesome. Also, he bread that they bring you with the baked cheese inside of it is great as well. For our second plate we shared a lobster spaghetti plate. Once again, phenomenal.\n\nMy dinner date had lamb and it was great. The meat absolutely melted in my mouth. I had some sea bass that was also very good.\n\nOverall, for two appetizers, 3 drinks, a pasta plate, and two main courses, the meal was less than $200. We've been to Barelotta at the Wynn, and while this might not be the same caliber of food, the price comparison makes this place phenomenal."

Unfortunately our experience at the Vegas location was a huge disappointment. The food was still delicious, but it was completely eclipsed by the terrible service we received, and we left with a bad taste in our mouths despite that scrumptious pomodoro. Our surly server wore a perpetual scowl, avoided our eyes when we tried to flag him down, and seemed eager to flee the table as soon as he unceremoniously dumped our food down, without waiting to see if we needed anything else. You would think he didn't WANT us to order more cocktails or courses. Getting a basket of that delicious bread proved extremely difficult, let alone a second one. Worst of all, towards the end of our meal, three of us had finished our entrees, but two of us were still eating our shared pasta, when the servers started clearing plates, including said hard-won bread basket. They literally cleared every plate from a six-top except the one we were eating from. WHAT?! No. Unacceptable. Rule no. 1. Do not clear until everyone has finished eating! I cringed for the waiter but I was also very disappointed and shocked to experience this kind of service at a high end, expensive restaurant. Needless to say we felt rushed out and couldn't savor the last bites of our meal because everyone else at the now empty table was sitting there twiddling their thumbs. Going to a nice restaurant isn't just about the food - it's about the service, atmosphere, and overall experience. This is true everywhere but especially in Vegas. Scarpetta failed miserably on this front."

The waiter here is very helpful and funny. \n \nThe food here is delicious:\n\n+ Beef Tartare: Cooked with lime juice so quite sour but refreshing. Very different from traditional beef tartare.\n+ Raw Yellowtail: It's okay. Pretty typical, but I'm surprise how non-fatty the fish taste considering hamachi is a fattier fish.\n+ The spaghetti: good as always--al dente with a sauce that's sweet with a hint of tang. \n+ Tagliatelle: A pasta with spring veggies. This tasted too green and peas-filled for me. The cream sauce also too thick. \n+ Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli: This was delicious but the foie gras taste is very mild. \n+ Mediterranean Branzino: The fish has a really, really nice sear on the outside and it was very soft and tasty. \n\nDon't skip dessert! Dessert was phenomenal! \n\n+ Strawberry Tart : The tart crust was amazing! It has that crunch and the cream was so light. The meringue that came with the dessert didn't taste like basil as described, but it was still really good. \n\n+and the Nutella & Vanilla Creme Bomboloni: Reminds me of hot bigne with creamy nutty chocolate center! It's so good. And I have no idea how they caramelized a banana. It has the crunch and then creaminess of the fruit."

Scarpetta excels at pasta.\n\nWhile it is true, a recent trip to Italy has forever altered my perception of Italian food (the reason for the loss of a star), Scarpetta delivers with an Italian chic d\u00e9cor, light spirited service, contemporary plating, and Italian cooking sensibility.\n\nStraight to the pastas.  Plated as a secondi (second course before the main), portions are smaller.  Do like the Italians, save your bread to mop up the left over sauce once you finish the pasta.  Trust me, do it, you'll understand.\n\nThe tagliatelle with a truffle zabaglione and guanciale, a take on carbonara is excellent.  All the flavor of carbonara are there, just lighter. The pasta is toothsome and near perfect.\n\nDuck and foie ravioli.  Thin sheets of translucent pasta around packets of duck and melting foie.  Glazed with a sweet marsala and duck stock reduction.  The sauce is enriched with dribbles of foie fat as the little packets are broken open.\n\nFinally, the spaghetti with tomato and basil is a take on amatriciana.  Simple, fresh pure of tomato, hint of fresh basil.  Clean flavor.\n\nAlthough I'm happy with two or three pastas, most think I've gone foodie crazy so if you must, the  mains.  The spiced duck breast with endive, preserved orange, and cipollini onions is excellent.  Perfectly rendered, the skin of the rare duck is crisp with no cloying underlying raw fat.  It's earthy, ducky flavor cut by the sauce of preserved orange and duck jus creates a very well balanced dish.  Not to be outdone, the fennel spiced black cod.  Hints of licorice taint the delicate flavor of the cod, the acidity of tomatoes and the briny, salty flavor of olives elevate it.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the mantecato of baccala the menu promised.  All good, the dish worked.\n\nGreat wine list.  Heavy emphasis on Italy.  \n\nIs Scarpetta truly Italian?  No.  (You should still tip your server; I miss Italy).  It does however, deliver a great experience."

If you order off the menu and consider appitizer, entree, dessert and wine, this is at least a push if not a better deal.\n\nWaiter seconded our decision as a good deal and the night began!  Each course of food was presented with a different wine with a short explanation of each.  The flavors were described both before trying the wine with the food and what we should expect after trying it with the food.\n\nThe entire meal lasted about two hours and each dish was unique in both presentation and flavor.  If anything, we'd suggest maybe some sorbet between one or two courses for cleansing and maybe take just a little bit more time.  Five or six (we can't remember because even with about a 3 oz serving of wine, that's a lot of grape to consume!) is courses is a bunch of food and even at two hours, it was a lttile bit rushed.\n\nWaiter was very nice, buss service great.

The prices looked a little over the top but we figured it would be worth it since the reviews were so favorable.\n\nWe had the white asparagus soup with blue crab, which was good.  A little on the small side, but it was decent. \n\n For our main plate we had to have the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli as all the reviews made it sound like it was the best dish in Vegas. My first serving of this was SALTY. I sent it back.  I usually have a high tolerance for salt, but the ravioli was so salty I had no choice but to send it back.  I think i've sent back a dish once or twice in my entire life.  I asked for the same Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli back and when I got it, it was BLAND.  The foie gras didn't really taste of anything.  It was just a bland mush wrapped in a noodle. It was kind of pointless.  I can't see why people go crazy over it. One of my friends tasted it and said \"what is this, Chef Boyardee?\"\n\nMy wife had the Halibut and it was delicious. No complaints there. It was cooked perfect with a nice sear and the side of  potatoes in yogurt were really nice.\n\nA friend of mine had the Mediterranean Branzino and complained that it was bland, nothing special.  He had also ordered the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli which he never received.\n\nAnother friend ordered the Spaghetti (tomato & basil) which was nice, simple and well done.  The tomato sauce is great. Noodles are perfect and al dente.  After the Halibut, the plain ol' spaghetti was the best dish at the table.\n\nMy other friend ordered the Short Rib Agnolotti and couldn't even touch it.  The horseradish was way too overpowering. I tried it, and I kind of agreed. If you eat 1 or 2 pieces it might be tolerable, but if you eat an entire plate of it, the horseradish would knock you down.  Needless to say, the plate was barely touched.\n\nWe left this place very disappointed.  The service was kind of snobby and didn't really do anything for the errors or the half eaten, awful food we were served.   It would be nice when a restaurant fesses up for their mistakes and does something to please the customer but I AM NEVER coming back to this place again.  The reviews here are so flat out wrong.  There is NO WAY that Duck + Foie Gras Ravioli dish is anything better than anything I've had at Olive Garden or Buca Di Beppo (and i hate Olive Garden)\n\nOh ya, 2 stars are simply for the Halibut, Spaghetti and the free bread.."

Before you get to the spaghetti, enjoy the dark, modern, understated ambience. If you're lucky enough to be seated by the window, you'll be able to catch the Bellagio fountain water shows. \n\nThe bread basket they being is not your run-of-the-mill sort of deal. There's a serious assortment of delicious options (the rosemary focaccia is amazing!) served with mascarpone butter, eggplant caponata, and citrus-infused olive oil. \n\nThey have a nice selection of wine, including maybe a dozen options by the glass. Didn't have much experience with their cocktails, but the old fashioned that my husband ordered was way too sweet. \n\nBesides the spaghetti, other menu highlights were the asparagus, which was cooked perfectly, with an egg yolk vinaigrette (hollandaise-esque, but not too heavy) and capers, and the creamy polenta with truffled mushroom fricasee--so flavorful and umami. The polenta was so loose it was a little difficult to eat without dripping all over, but the buttery mushroom goodness happening way more than made up for that shortcoming."

Can't miss with Scarpetta, I will go back for seconds."

Pasta is made fresh, so be patient for your meal. I was disappointed at first with them only having one vegetarian option (spaghetti) but it was great so I'm glad it worked out. I'm sure if I told them my food choice concern, they would have offered to make substitutions but I just didn't want to go through the drama that night."

            "review": "What is with me and over-hyped restaurants for the end of 2012?  Scarpetta definitely belongs in this category based on the taste vs price category.  I mean, the restaurant looked nice, and the service was decent (if not spotty)...but the food just didn't do it.\n\nHere's what I got to try:\nBread:  Bread was good, but not amazing like how some reviewers portrayed it.  I will give points to them having stromboli  =)  .\n\nFritto Misto : Nice portion size but $17 for fried seaweed (super oily) with little bits of shrimp?\n\nScallops: Smelled great and was very tasty.   $17 for two scallops.\n\nRaw Yellowtail: $16 for 4 REALLY thin slices of yellowtail.  Jaws not happy.  #AVOID\n\nSpaghetti:  At $24, I expected my mind to be blown into spaghetti heaven, maybe even meeting the dogs from Lady and the tramp.  However, I was really underwhelmed by the sauce.  There was little to no seasoning so basically all I was tasting was a bit of crushed tomatoes, cheese, with bits of basil.  Simplicity does not mean bland.  The noodles were cooked al dente and had a nice texture, so that is the lone bright spot. Ugh....BLAND BLAND BLAND.\n\nDuck & Foie Gras Ravioli: $26.  Foie Gras in a ravioli? Must be amazing right?  Instead it was so dry that I felt like I was eating melted sand paper.  I thought duck meat was supposed to be tender and juicy?  I guess mixing duck meat and foie gras was a bad move.  The marsala reduction was delightful as I wish there was more of it to compensate for the dryness of the filling.\n\nRoasted Chicken : Finally, a delicious dish.  It was cooked perfectly and finally seasoned correctly.  I don't mind paying a pretty penny for food...as long as its delicious!  But do keep in mind that this was still $29.  \n\nChocolate cake: Standard.\n\nDoughnuts with filling:  It is what it is.  Doughnuts tossed in sugar with chocolate/vanilla filling.  I couldn't overlook that this dish was COLD when we ate it.  I understand that the filling could have caused that...but still... doughnuts should at least be warm!\n\nBottom line: Good environment, spotty service, and overhyped and expensive food give this place 2 stars."

Service is great but the kitchen timing needs work. Food came out a bit slow and a bit cold which is normally a big time no-no but they are new and working out the kinks.\n\nFood is delicious, apps of short ribs and polenta truffles with mushrooms make for a great start. Polenta was creamy and truffle accents were spot on. \n\nPastas are house-made and cooked just al-dente. Easy to do but somehow few places get it right. The spaghetti with creamy tomato and basil, just perfect, a great representation of Italian food in its simplistic goodness. Black cod done well, cooked nicely. \n\nDuck and foie gras ravioli was a bit salty and cold and the agnolotti seemed too one dimensional. Both were slightly warm and would have been better paired with a side. Plates seemed a bit bare.\n\nDesserts-  very creative. Napoleon-  deconstructed creme brulee with blood oranges, sweet and creamy, amazing combination. \n\nNutella warm molten chocolate bites with hazelnuts were also deliciously comforting. \n\nOverall, given the lack of decent Italian eateries with value on the Strip, it's worth a visit. Once they get the timing down, the kitchen and the service make this a sure-bet for a quality meal."

First, I definitely would request a window view of the Bellagio water show if you can, because my boyfriend and I saw three shows while enjoying our dinner. Scarpetta's very romantic but is also just a great place for a one-of-a-kind Italian meal. \n\nWe started out with sharing a glass of Pinot Noir, which was delicious and smooth. For an appetizer, I highly recommend the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms...then you must dip the bread they give you into the mushroom mixture. Deliciouso! I ordered the simple, but unforgettable Tomato and Basil Spaghetti and my boyfriend ordered the Short Rib Agnolotti, which he devoured. All their pasta is made fresh at the restaurant and can't be compared to any other pasta I've had. You must try it for yourself!\n\nReservations can be made online, and I definitely recommend this to anyone who is visiting Las Vegas with their significant other or wants to make a good first impression :)"

After moving to Los Angeles, I went to the one in Beverly Hills pretty often (until they closed recently) and enjoyed every experience there, too.\n\nWe got to Vegas fairly late on a Friday night and I was excited to find out that Scarpetta was still open. We were seated quickly and I knew everything that I wanted to order (short rib risotto, spaghetti, and the chicken). \n\nDirectly in front of our table, there was a table of 4, one person that was visibly very intoxicated. I wasn't surprised at all since it is Vegas and a Friday night. However, the waiter kept serving the entire table more wine, even as this guy was slurring and barely able to hold himself up. \n\nI'm halfway into my risotto when I notice him put his head down on the table. The restaurant is fairly empty at this point so there are a lot of staff just standing around. By the time I'm done with the risotto, he's completely lying down in his booth. My spaghetti comes out, and as I take a bite of my delicious food, I look up to see the guy projectile vomit. It's splashing all over the booth and the sound is as gross as the actual view.\n\nThe staff get over there and start cleaning up and a few minutes later, someone stops by at our table to see how we're doing. I tell him we've obviously lost our appetite and he asks if we would like our plates (which are nearly untouched) packed up. They bring us our food in to go boxes along with the bill.\n\nSo I'm not an unreasonable person. I don't blame Scarpetta for a drunk person in Vegas on a Friday night. The issue I have is that they continued to serve drinks to him, leading to him vomiting in front of other patrons. After that, we don't even get an apology, the manager doesn't stop by, and we're asked to pay for the entire bill. \n\nThe situation was handled poorly by their staff, and I still had to pay for the entire crappy experience."

It was nothing short of amazinnng!  I will warn you, the portions are large for a tasting menu and you will get full! Ladies don't make the mistake of wearing a tight dress like I did! I was iffy about the tasting menu because I normally wouldn't choose to order most of what was on it and my boyfriend isn't a huge seafood person but we were feeling adventurous and wow were we surprised. The items I remembered the most were the raw yellowtail, fennel dusted black cod, spaghetti, and the desserts! Who knew simple spaghetti could be soo good! They were also sooo nice to give us three extra items on top of the tasting menu! Oh and also, their bread basket is the best I've had. Stromboli bread. Oh my goodness, I have dreams about this bread haha. The  ambience is very romantic and dimmly lit yet didn't feel stuffy or stiff like some higher end restaurants. I wish I took pictures but since our table was in the middle of two others tables I didn't want to disturb anyone with the flash of my camera. Oh and the view is really pretty!

I think this is probably one of the better restaurants on the Strip. I enjoyed the ambiance and the view was relatively nice. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I ordered the truffle mushroom polenta, the filet mignon, and lobster pici. Everything I ate was pretty solid. The steak was tender and cooked well and reasonably priced. The pici was a bit pricey, but it tasted pretty good and I appreciated that is was more unique than other pastas I've had. The sauce was nice and spicy and the lobster was cooked well. The pasta is homemade here which is a plus. I didn't mind paying more for it. The truffle mushroom polenta was also yummy considering the mushy texture of polenta. It was flavored well. Some of my friends ordered the Sphagetti with basil marina sauce (no meat) here and I had a try. I wasn't too impressed and wouldn't spend the 20ish dollars on it for something so plain and simple and without any meat. They raved about the sauce, but honestly I can get something similar at Trader Joes from a bag and I actually think it tastes better. Eek. \n\nThe service was okay. The only big negative is that they forgot my pasta, which was unfortunate. \n\nOverall, I'd definitely come here again for the food if I want a nice decently priced fancy dinner on the strip and I wouldn't hesitate taking friends here."

For appetizer we had the creamy polenta. Enough for one or two to share as it is extremely rich as a separate duo of perfectly creamed polenta and truffled mushrooms. If you haven't already gobbled up your breads, make useful tool to sweep up the last juices.\nThree of us got the black cod which is superbly moist and light with a crisp skin, but the vegetables (fennel/peppers) were a bit too sour to match with.  And the other three got the duck foie gras ravioli which was rich and poignant with flavor but not unpleasant. The balsamic glaze was apparent and not overwhelming. I would have finished the entire plate.  \n\nWhy the three stars? LACK of consistent service :(\nI don't include the guy who kept our water glasses filled. But we were all (party of 6) sourly disappointed with the main waiter. He only presented himself to take our order and serve the appetizer.  Didn't even refilled our breads as asked.  Then with empty plates, we all sat there for 15 minutes watching our server chummy up with a table of 3 girls and another table drinking it up with ample wine bottles. An assistant manager in a suit, bless him, came over, asked how our dinner was, saw our plates and decided to clear our table himself and also bring us our check.\nAlthough we weren't completely dissatisfied with the whole dining experience, it's just unsettling when the server is MIA with you and present elsewhere. \nSo, maybe next time.

We both absolutely loved our mains and definitely had a low key food fight of sorts over the spaghetti. Definitely more than enough food, but not so much that you regret ordering one extra main to split. Do not skip the spaghetti, I guarantee you will regret it. If not for the way it is served (under the dome) but definitely for the simplicity, yet amazing flavor.\n\nAs for the finale or dessert, we opted for the Amedei Chocolate Cake.

            "review": "Yelp Fail. \n\nThis was my girlfriend's first time in Las Vegas, so I wanted to bring her to an upscale place and have her try some food from supposedly exclusive restaurants in vegas. Based on the yelp reviews, and time availability, I chose Scarpetta. It was a major disappointment, and I felt so bad bringing her to this establishment. This was the first restaurant experience she had in Vegas and it was horrendous. \n\nLet me say that this review is based on three dishes that we had at Scarpetta. \n\n1. Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli (main course)\n2. Short Rib Agnolotti (main course)\n3. Roasted Diver Scallops (appetizer)\n\nAmbiance:\n\nThe seating and view were great. We were the table almost next to the window where the Belagio water show was going on. There was a great view of the show. The lighting was also dim. It is definitely a nice place to bring a date.\n\nPrice:\n\nDespite the $$$, the prices are not too outrageous for Las Vegas. The main course dishes were 25 and 26 dollars while the roasted scallops were 23 dollars. \n\nService:\n\nService was horrible. We were there for over an hour. Our waiter checked up on us twice, once to bring more water and the second time to see if our food was ready. We waited for about 15-20 minutes to get our scallop appetizer. No apologies or more complementary bread. The wait for the food seemed the norm, as the tables next to us finished their food and were just making small talk while waiting for over 20 minutes. After we finished our scallops, we proceeded to wait another almost 30 minutes for our main course. Again, no apologies or further check ups. I ran out of water while waiting for our main course, during the appetizer, and did not get a refill until I had to ask for one (after the main course came). When we wanted to tell the waiter about the problems with our main courses, he and other waiters could not be found for about 20 minutes. We just sat there looking at each other and our plates (almost untouched). Simply horrible.\n\nFood:\n\nScallops - these were actually very good. They were simple scallops that were fresh and cooked well. I would definitely get this again.\n\nDuck and Foie Gras Ravioli - came out cold, tough, and very very very salty. We have had foie gras before, and this was well beyond what it was supposed to taste like. It left a bitter and salty taste in the mouth that could only be drowned out by eating the complimentary bread with their house tomato sauce. My girlfriend did not want to waste food so she tried to put the ravioli in her mouth followed by water as a chaser. She soon became sick and had to go to the bathroom. She only finished about 1/3 of the plate before I told her to stop. \n\nShort Rib Agnolotti - gross. The noodles were tough and cold. The sauce made the bread crumbs stick to the noodles and caused the noodles to stick together like one giant pasta. I had trouble eating one bite of it. After finally taking a bit, the food was bland and left an unpleasant aftertaste. It was one of the worst dishes I have had in a long time. I am usually not too picky with pasta, but this Agnolotti was inedible. The noodles were rubbery hard and the sauce was cold and crusted onto the noodles. The appearance did not help. The food looked like someone threw up on the plate. The sauce was black or very dark brown (could not tell because of the dim lighting), but the appearance made the food even less appetizing. \n\nConclusion of the meal:\n\nAfter about 20 minutes of the food being on the plate, almost completely untouched, the waiter came by to ask \"how was everything tasting.\" I told the waiter that the food was inedible and that it was probably the worst thing I've had in recent memory. The waiter's face was priceless. He did not seem shocked at all, rather, he just appeared to be apologetic. The waiter took the food off our table and asked if we wanted anything else. At this point, the restaurant was about to close and we did not want to wait another 30 minutes to get some inedible food. I told him to just give me the check so we can get out of there. They took the two dishes off our bill and our almost 2 hour meal came out to a whopping $23 (for the scallops). What a waste of time and appetite.\n\nThis trend of inedible food was not isolated to only our table table. While waiting for our food, the table behind us asked for the check and had two dishes that were inedible and left untouched as well. I did hear that the fish was decent from the table behind us, but that was the extent of praise Scarpetta's food received. \n\nOverall:\n\nI felt the need to write a long rant about this place. This dinner was supposed to be a happy and memorable event for my girlfriend because it was her very first dinner in vegas. Instead, it was only memorable because of how bad the restaurant service and food were. Considering there are a ton of great great places in vegas, I would highly advise anyone to pass on Scarpetta."

We had so many dishes I can't even remember it all (or all the fancy names) but it was amazing! I had the pasta with clams & my husband had their spaghetti. Both excellent! I am SUPER picky about my pasta being over cooked but this place was on POINT! I had the raw tuna appetizer which was just heavenly! We also had the polenta with mushrooms which was delicious!!! I don't even like mushrooms but this was soooo good! \nDesserts were the highlight of this dinner! My good friend is a BIG DESSERTS girl so when our table was covered in desserts she about died. We had 5 different desserts the 4 of us shared and every single one was thoroughly enjoyed! Yum! My husband and my friend said the cheesecake and the souffle were by far the best they ever had! Personally I LOVED the homemade soda/fruit dessert that came out! It was so different and SO YUMMY!"

I went and spoke with the manager, Kelly, who said she would do whatever she could to help me out. When we arrived at the restaurant she said she would see what she could do. We grabbed a drink at the bar and 10 minutes later we were told our table was ready. I was expecting the small corner in the table, but was pleasantly surprised when we were seated at probably the best table in the restaurant. The last table right next to the window which gave us an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains. Titus our waiter was excellent! The food was incredible as always! The night turned out amazing all because of Kelly. Great manager!!!"

            "review": "Came here for a girl's weekend out. What a great experience! \nScarpetta is located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. It's quite swanky, so you will want to dress up so you don't stick out like a sore thumb. The ambience is classy /sophisticated. The lighting is a bit dark, but that's why this is a great set up for looking out the window at night to see the Bellagio water show. It's a great place to take a date or to just have a \"let's get dressed up cuz we can\" night out with the girls.\nWe had a reservation, so we were seated immediately. May I just mention that the service here is magnificent. There was just the three of us, but they still sat us in a huge booth that can easily sit 6 people. It's a circular booth, so I was a little apprehensive about scooting with my little black dress on. Without saying a word, our host slid the whole table out, so that we can walk to our seats instead of scooting. From then, they had already won me over =).\n Ok, let's get to the food shall we? We started with the \"Braised short ribs of beef\" which is placed over root vegetables and risotto. Delish. The short rib was soft and delicate and melt in your mouth deliciousness. Not over seasoned at all. There are four small pieces, but each bite is delightful. The other appetizer that we decided to share was the \"Roasted Sea Scallops\" which is served over cauliflower, bottarge, cili and caper sauce. Aaaaaaaaaa-mazing. If I wasn't so nice, I would've eaten both pieces instead of share it. ;-)\nThe complimentary bread came with three spreads - butter, eggplant, and olive oil. All three tasted great and the different types of bread were warm and soft and all kinds of good =P. And since I love bread... this just won me over even more.\nSo since this is an Italian restaurant and the chef became famous because of his spaghetti, we all decided to order pasta. We ordered \"Duck and foie gras ravioli\", \"spaghetti,\" and \"stracci\"... all of which were heavenly. The ravioli was soft, but not mushy and filled with such great flavor that my friend, who was already really full midway, ate the whole entire dish. Spaghetti - you think it's just regular good ol' spaghetti... not at all. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was on point. Not too salty, not too sweet. perfect. My dish was the Stracci - flat pieces of hand made noodles with lobster, crab, shrimp, and basil breadcrumbs. If you're mouth has not watered just reading that - something is seriously wrong with you. This is probably my most favorite pasta dish. They did not skimp on the blue crabs (I at least believe it's blue crabs, though, I can't be entirely sure), the lobster mean, and the shrimp. I wanted to save room for dessert, but I just couldn't stop stuffing myself with this dish. I loved that the flat noodles didn't stick to each other and it was soft and just really well made. I loved loved loved it!\nI wish I could tell you we ordered dessert. But the three of us were just so full that we decided to opt out of the dessert. Though all of them sounded amazing.\nIn any case, I rarely give out 5's. For me, something has to stick out. In this case, though the food was extraordinary, the service and the view puts it over my usual 4 stars into  a 5 star yelp review.\nBottom line: I would definitely come here again.. so there's not reason why you shouldn't try it out =)"

The restaurant itself is still outstanding. And the food is great, EXCEPT, one thing just didn't seem the same anymore.  The shortrib appetizer.  All of us at the table agreed that something changed and it really wasn't good.  In fact, it's definitely now something I wouldn't order again.  The meat was dry and the flavor just wasn't there. And as for service, our waiter was nice...but there was a server who continued to hover around our table.  Attentiveness is appreciated but hovering when we're trying to enjoy our dinner was a little annoying.  And my last gripe - I ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert. Normally, the servers set it up for you and show you how to pour the chocolate over, put the toppings, etc.  But nothing.  They just placed this gigantic beautiful souffle in front of me and I stared it at like how am I supposed to eat this.  It was great, but I just thought it was weird that they didn't offer any help.   I still love Scarpetta but ... this night they were a little off."

Our waiter was very knowledgable and helpful, and the service was great. The decor was gorgeous, and had great ambiance. I would say it was very romantic with the dim lighting and lots of dark hardwood. The view was also beautiful, and we could watch Bellagio water show while we ate. \n\nNow onto the food...\n\nFirst off, we were very impressed with the complimentary bread. One of them had spinach and smoked mozzarella baked into it! We started with the crispy fritto misto as an appetizer, which was great. It was delicious on it's own...no aioli needed! I had the Pici for my entr\u00e9e. Tasted really great, but there was quite a bit of spice to it. It had a chili pesto sauce, so I should have expected it. It had a good amount of lobster in it. My boyfriend had the Tagliatelle, and we both decided that was the winner. The creamy truffle zabaglione sauce was to die for! The fresh vegetables and pancetta mixed in made it not overly rich as well. The pastas are made fresh there, and we could definitely taste the quality! We each had a glass of a nice Pinot Noir to enjoy with our pastas. \n\nIt was a little pricy, but the quality is just so great and overall experience made it so worth it! There are so many great restaurants to try in Vegas, but I know I will be back to Scarpetta. Definitely one of my top dining experiences!"

At best the food was uninteresting.\n\nThe first course was cold, the second course was barely warm (the pasta was dry as if it had been sitting around) and the third course was just warm but tasted awful. It was described to me as being a slow roasted baby goat.. sounded delicious. When it came, it was dry, tough and overly gamey. I usually love gamey meat, lamb, duck,etc... I sent it back, which I've only ever done twice before. The assistant manager came by to tell me that the goats they've been getting in are smaller than they should be and don't have enough fat on them. So why is this goat still on the menu?\n\nI've eaten at some really great places  (Hatfield's, Eleven Madison, Lucques, Bouchon, ...) and am more than willing to spend money on a great meal. This is NOT in that category of restaurant. It's really lame to be charging those prices for such mediocre (at best) food."

            "review": "The BF and I had trouble deciding where to go for our anniversary and he had put me to the task of finding a place with a scallop appetizer and a solid light white fish entree and Scarpetta won out in our short lists of places that fit the bill. \n\nI love the 50's low lights and bold dark wood grain used in the restaurant. We were seated by the windows to witness a rainy and moody sky (which I happen to like). People said this is a nice view...but there is a large partition on the windows and it happens to be at eye level.  I cant see the water, only the top of the spray of the Bellagio show. It defeated the purpose a little bit....\n\nSTARTERS\n\nWe started off with the raved about bread basket. There was a stromboli in there rolled with cheeses and salami that was delicious. If I could order that at the lounge I would. There was also sourdough slice, a bread roll, 2 herbed foccacia squares. They give a trio of butter, a eggplant caponata and citrus infused oil. Caponata was lovely and all the bread was warm, soft and nicely crusty.\n\nROASTED SEA SCALLOPS- which they split onto two presentations for each of us to have one. It was a very fresh scallop, nicely seared. There was a light spice that came through as you chewed it, capers and bottarga on top gave some briny flavor, micro green some bitterness and salmoriglio made for a nice creamy sauce to it. It was served on top of a steak of cauliflower that was nicely roasted. \n\nDUCK AND FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI with marsala reduction - was one I was very curious about since many rave about this and the spaghetti. I've had the spaghetti before in LA (and did not weep) and now that I actually know the Scarpetta recipe and have replicated it, I wanted to know if something else was rave worthy. This was tasty, but it was just a bit TOO rich for such a big plate of it.  Some may love a whole heap, but I'm glad it was split as a appetizer...and still there was too many for us. We're freegetarians ( semi vegetarians) and don't really have many rich foods since switching over to the dark side..\n\nENTREE\n\nMEDITERRANEAN BRANZINO - Came with 2 nice sized filets with nicely crisp skin and beautifully flaky meat. If came with a bed of braised leeks, celery root, shrimps, clams and mussels and had a seafood broth reduction as a sauce so it was very clean, sea flavors going on here.\n\nBLACK COD - fish was nice and buttery, with a herbaceous,somewhat anise tasting, tomato glaze and micro chives. It had caramelized fennel & roasted tomato to go with. I've always had black cod aka butterfish in a Asian preparation so this was interesting to try something different. \n\nThe BF preferred the Branzino and so did I.\n\nDESSERT \n\nZEPPOLE - with nutella center, vanilla sauce & candied hazelnuts was divine. These were rich pillows of heaven. I love zeppoles and beignets of all kinds and this is among the best I've had. Will come back. Just for these. \n\nBROWN BUTTER HAZELNUT CAKE - the name makes it sound like it would be more brown buttery cakey thing, but it truly was more about the lemon curd, meringue. I'm slowly growing to like lemon desserts and this was good enough to make me believe in it. It had olive oil gelato & candied hazelnuts to go which gave a light savory aspect to it. This was a great choice to balance out the zeppole since those were just dense and this was bright. \n\nService was decent. There was a mixup with the kitchen and our appetizers went to the wrong table at first, back to the kitchen and eventually to us. Service cleared plates and refilled drinks quite frequently and checked on us. A little weird note but in the area we were seated the chef was coming around and talking to tables and even serving one of the tables around us. I guess good that there are regulars but found little awkward as well. \n\nIt was a solid choice for dinner and went home happy. I see they have a vegetarian menu and have a nice lounge area so I would consider coming back for a snack there and those zeppoles...I don't know if I would do a \"all out\" dinner here again though.\n\nThe night after our dinner here we went to a establishment off strip and the flavor and quality was on par with better prices, vibe and surpasses in service. \n\nOverall, Scott Conants place is solid for the Strip and I'm glad it is here, but it was surprisingly not the star of our weekend."

I don't know where it was incorporated. If I was a chopped judge I would have taken points off for not really tasting this main ingredient in that dish. The horseradish was definitely the main kick in that dish. We also tried the Bronzini fish dish which was pretty good and made to perfection. We tried our friends dish who got the foi gras ravioli and that was the highlight of the table. For desert we got the little round donuts which were pretty good. I have to mention that the bread service was definitely one of a kind with some bread baked with some kinda salami."

I went here with a friend as our first meal on her first trip to Vegas. When you enter, the restaurant looks tiny... like a long hallway, and then when you get to the end it opens into a large restaurant with a big window overlooking the Bellagio fountains .... so cool. I was worried that I would need to order a lot to get full and spend a ton of money.... not the case. We both ended up ordering the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti and not only was it delicious but it was super filling. It was savory, had varying texture, and spiced perfectly... I loved every bite. That, in addition to their amazing bread basket (including 4 types of bread with some stuffed with cheese/meat/veg and 3 dips a whipped soft cheese spread, citrus olive oil, and eggplant), filled us up...awesome! We finished with the waiter recommended doughnut dessert.... I had one complaint about that dessert, either I missed it or they didn't tell us that one side of the plate was all nutella filled donuts and the other side was all vanilla... I thought the vanilla and nutella would be mixed...so when I was eating from one side and my friend was eating from the other side we were both confused where the other flavor was.... Anyway, the nutella donut with the banana gelato was awesome, the vanilla...not so much. That was a pretty minor problem. Our service was great and we each paid about 30$...not bad at all. Will be back for sure."

The Restaurant Week menu is somewhat limited in selections, but what it has was very good.\n\nI was seated next to the window overlooking the Bellagio and the fountains which added to the good atmosphere of the restaurant.  I was brought menus and an iced tea.  I had to ask for the Restaurant Week menu and it was brought.  I had already made my choice from the online menu but sometimes things change so I wanted to make sure.\n\nI was brought a nice bread basket with sourdough and three other breads.  Accompanying it was a trio of bread toppers/dippers--mascarpone butter, caponata, and a citrus infused olive oil.  All three were good, but I could have eaten a plate of the caponata!  The mild citrus flavor in the olive oil made that my second choice.\n\nFor the starter, I ordered the creamy polenta with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.  The polenta was brought in a white dish and the server then spooned the onion and wild mushroom mixture over the polenta.  The dish was excellent.  I almost took some bread to wipe up any leftover polenta.\n\nFor the main course, I got the fennel dusted black cod on a bed of concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel.  The fish was cooker perfectly and was moist and soft but with a crisp crust.  The crust had a mild anise flavor from the fennel.  The tomatoes beneath, concentrated by baking until some of the water was rendered which gave the tomato a prominent flavor.  The roasted fennel was tasty.\n\nFor dessert, there was no choice but that didn't matter.  The bomboloni was a wonderful way to end a good meal.  The bomboloni consisted of two filled with Nutella ganache and one was filled with a vanilla cream.  Alongside was a small scoop of banana ice cream resting on crushed chocolate shortbread pieces.  Excellent!\n\nService was good for the most part.  Two small things--when your posted opening time is 6 PM, open at 6.  Seating people almost 10 minutes late is not the best form especially if someone has a show they need to get to.  Also, I had two Sweet 'n Low wrappers on the table that neither a runner nor the server cleared even though both were by several times.  That's something you wouldn't expect from a restaurant of this class.  I'm sure Chef Conant would point this out if he were dining there.  I wish I didn't have to ask for the Restaurant Week menu.  It was a sheet of paper.  Bring it with your large books of wine and dinner menus."

My bf decided to order the duck and foie gras ravioli with marsala reduction ($27) and I ordered the endive and apple salad with heirloom beets, gorgonzola cheese and candied walnuts ($17). \n\nOnce our orders were placed, the breadbasket was brought out. I truly appreciated the attention placed into informing the patrons on the different types of breads and dips. It was helpful because now I knew exactly what types of gourmet breads we would be feasting on! From what I can recall, I remember a small ciabatta, a piece of foccacia, and two breads with mozzarella and salami baked in. The breads were warm, and enclosed in a cloth napkin with another piece of traditional Italian bread placed atop it. The bread basket was divine and each piece of bread paired nicely with the soft, spreadable butter, salty eggplant spread and the citrus-infused olive oil dip. As a matter of fact, the bread was so good that I asked the server for another basket and that was brought out--only to be devoured again! \n\nAs for the entrees, the presentation was extremely beautiful for both dishes. The foie gras was plated on the plate with the marsala reduction drizzled beautifully over the top. The ravioli was plentiful and this surprised my bf since he was only expecting a handful of ravioli. My endive and beet salad was truly one of the most beautiful salads I've ever seen. The endives were sliced thinly and the bitter after taste of the endives paired quite nicely with the sweetness of the beets, apples and candied walnuts while the salty gorgonzola cheese bits added the necessary salty punch to the sweet and bitter. \n\nThe ambience was romantic, dim and quiet. My bf and I really enjoyed dinner that night. The overall price may not be cheap but for the quality of the food, it was well justified.\n \nBottom line: I would return for that breadbasket alone!"

I find owners and management of restaurants that originate in NYC tend to run their restaurants the same way here in Vegas and in general the wrong way here on the west coast. Management is rude and thus rubs off on their employees. Service is slow and we found ourselves asking for everything water, drinks, desert menu etc....small portions and ridiculously high prices. Food was luke warm and unseasoned. chocolate cake for desert was good. This place has a long way to go. Stay away and eat at one of the other 100 great restaurants Vegas has to offer."

It is quiet, fancy, and the wait staff is very professional. It is, a bit pricey, however. I think spaghetti with marinara sauce is something like $25. It is, however, probably the best spaghetti you'll eat! I had the broccoli rob ($11) and the potatoes ($11) and let me tell you...they were absolutely delicious! I can't describe the flavor because it was so perfect. While $22 for broccoli and potatoes seems a bit pricey, I think it was worth every penny. My mom had gluten free pasta in a marinara sauce and my dad had some sort of ravioli. They both said their meals were delicious as well."

When we arrived we were told their kitchen was closed due to a \"mishap\" but we could order from an alternate menu. We were a little confused but decided to go ahead since we were all dressed up and ready to eat. Once we were seated and looking at the menu, we realized that they were serving food from their sister restaurant next door. We were very disappointed since we've read so many good things about their food on yelp.     Then they brought out a complimentary appetizer which was very good. Had the meal and then they brought us 2 delicious desserts, one had \"happy anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate. Very nice. Then the big surprise came when the waiter informed us that the meal was on the house!!!  Totally unexpected! maybe the waiter sensed our dissappointment earlier in the evening, but we hadn't complained at all. \n\nSo... I can't give an honest review of their food. However, the fact that they gave us our meal free says A LOT about how they feel about their customers. Very classy.  They made things right in a big way. \n\nAs for ambience... Very classy, dark, contemporary and cool. They sat us by the window with a nice view of the bellagio fountains. \n\nAgain, can't tell u about scarpettas food, but how can I not give them 5 stars when they treated my wife and I so well."

We walked into a narrow room with no hostess to be found.  A little confused, we waited to see if we were in the right place. Along came a waiter to assist. He sat us by the windows. We got lucky.  We saw the amazing Bellagio fountain show every 15 minutes. It was pretty cool.  Dinner was good but pricey. I ordered 1/2 dozen of oysters to start and it was delis.  The homemade cocktail sauce was so perfect.  For my entree, I ordered the tagliatelle and it was okay. The first few bites were good but got heavy after a while, that and i'm not a fan of peas and carrots with my pasta.  My husband ordered the prime filet of beef with \npotato-lardo pur\u00e9e, rainbow chard & barolo sauce.  He loved it. The rainbow chard and barolo sauce was probably the best thing on the dish. We spent about $140 on dinner. i wasn't that impressed for the price but still good overall.   The view makes up for it. I'm a big fan of the Bellagio fountains and it never gets old."

OMG I just finished writing and realize no one in their right mind will ever read this- it's an essay!\n\nJust got back from an impromptu b-day trip from Las Vegas. Had an amazing time w the guy and the memorable meal of the trip was a b-day dinner at Scarpetta- great recommendation from a friend.\n\nEverything here is phenomenal but I want to start w the service. Mathew our server,  was cordial, friendly & extremely informative. The table next door said he was Captain Morgan come to life but he reminded us of a younger refined Gary Oldman mixed w someone else. :)\n\nOne thing I really appreciate in any server is someone that shares their experiences w various dishes and points you in the direction you want to go. We filled him in on the 3 dishes we knew we wanted and he put real thought into helping us choose the final dish. Not only that, he was exceptionally personable; and we had great small talk- always love that.\n\nAlright to the review and apologize in advance for the blabbering!\n\nTo Start: \nAn unassuming covered basket of bread is left on the table. On the outside is an inconspicuous piece of sliced sourdough on top... nothing special right?\nI'm thinking \"PASS trying to cut carbs!\"\nSurprise!!! 2 types of STROMBOLI (I believe it was Pesto/Cheese and Salami or a Tasso Ham and Cheese) and fresh rosemary cibatta inside. Proceed to annihilate entire basket.\n\nWe ended up sharing everything we ordered so they portioned out everything for us, it was perfect and presentation was beautiful. \n\nStarters:\nVancouver Island Oysters: Fresh Oysters, enough said.\n\nDungeness Crab and White Corn Soup: My rule of thumb is to always order soup if it's on the menu and isn't a house soup. I've been unsuccessful in making a solid corn soup, leave it to the professionals I say! This was the perfect, hot, super creamy, flavor filled soup I wish to one day master. The corn scent wafted into your nose as the base was poured over the  chunks of crab, table side. I definitely conjured Toucan Sam (corn soup version) for a second.\n\nPici: (pronounced peachy like the folders) \nHomemade pasta sort of like a thicker fettuccine noodle on steroids. Parsley and other goodies are blended in the flour which adds a green hue and extra umph. It comes w lobster and a taragon, almond and chili pesto. I'm not a huge pesto fan but luckily for me it's not a traditional pesto; it's not even a sauce. They give you the perfect amount to coat but not over power the dish and it has a serious kick. Very generous portion of lobster, and a staple at the restaurant. MUST TRY IT.\n\nKOBE BEEF RIB CAP: This was $68, on our last trip to Vegas we had the Japanese Waygu at Cut which I think has permanently changed my views on the price of steak.\nThis was 7 oz and extremely rich, barely needed a knife, and it just melted in your mouth. It came w potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms & a reduction that is seriously making my mouth water in retrospect.\n\nPeach Costata: Salted Shortbread covered w Cardamon ice cream and chunks of peach. It was a spicy dessert (take note if that's not your thing) that complimented our decaf cappuccino's! The decaf cap's were suggested by Mathew when we originally ordered just decaf coffee. Great suggestion, paired perfect w the dessert.\n\nOh MAN 2 things I left out- \nI had a dirty martini w blue cheese filled olives; holy goodness; i hope i can order this at other places.\n\nLastly; we were here on the 4th of July; right when we were paying Mathew mentioned we could wait because the fireworks at Caesar's were starting in 10 minutes. They allowed us to stay and watch for 30+ mins (late start) even though the restaurant was filling up. I thought that was really nice of them (they didn't even know it was my bday!) haha and there was no rush to get us out the door.\n\nTaking into account service, ambiance and quality I put this in my top 3 best dining experiences ever :) also you can  tell I loved the service considering I mentioned the server by name 3x in the post!? Foie Gras Ravioli, you're next!"

The place looks amazing and i dont now who they thought we were but we got the million dollar table. It must have been that new Calvin Klein dress i was wearing that made them think i was deserving of a table that overlooked the Bellagio fountains. I even asked my hot date if he tipped for that table, he swore he didn't. Whatever I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth i just enjoyed the amazing beautiful view and got ready to eat. \n\nThe service... Impeccable. Charming on the ball waiter with not too much sass but just enough chit chat. The food was prompt and delicious. I had the creamy truffle polenta and  super yummy black macaroni with lobster and Mr handsome across the table from me had the goat which was really good too. I know because even though i dont eat goat cuz i think its gross, he made me taste it and it was.. well, really good. And that's from a goat hater! The wine list is deep but not over complicated, even a wine Jr leauger like myself could find my way around it.\n\nIt was a real romantic fairytale night out, exactly what you think fine dinning should be.

Being that Vegas is expected to bring the best of the best and be over priced I was nervous taking my parents there when my dad was meeting my boyfriend for the first time.  I am Italian and we take eating meals together very seriously.  I must say that I was not disappointed one bit.  Their decor and ambience alone was impressive.  It was elegant and slightly rustic but not tacky like you see often in Vegas.  From the very well dressed GM Kelli who seated us to the extremely polite food runners the entire experience was definitely a plus.  Having worked in the food and beverage industry on the east coast and west coast I can be a tough critic but I would recommend this establishment to anyone who isn't afraid to spend some money on a good meal.  The appetizers were fairly small portioned but paired with the entree and dessert this place is perfect to have a 3 course meal and be more than satisfied.  I hardly give 5 stars and did not take a look at the wine menu so I can not speak on that.  I will have to return in order to add another star.  Thanks Scarpetta!"

The spaghetti noodles are cooked to an al dente. Rather than the spaghetti sauce poured on top, the noodles are simmered and cooked with simple sauce. The starch from the noodles holds onto the flavors bringing together the noodles and sauce. The spaghetti here is divine.\n\nIn addition to the spaghetti, our table also shared the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms, the braised short ribs of beef, and the raw yellowtail. All of which were equally as good.\n\nThe service was subpar. Our table had to constantly flag our waiter down. For a fine dining establishment, I felt like we were jipped. On top of the inattentiveness, my friend encountered a shard of plastic/glass in her salad. Lemme tell you, whatever she bit into was hard. HARD. Everyone at the table felt it and indeed, the shard was tough and hard. We sent the dish back to the kitchen and the chef simply said that we were mistaken and that shard was actually just a piece of hard sea salt....uh. Okay. Clearly that piece of salt sea did not melt in my friend's mouth and it was HARD. Sea salt my ass.\n\nThe food is good, but go to the one in Beverly Hills. This place sucks. And maybe they cater toward out of towners who don't know any better, but for the vast majority- we know what fine dining should look and feel like and this certainly is not it."

Daily special linguini was good but salty. If saltiness of this dish was perfect, it could be the best dish of the day. Signature tomato home made spaghetti , fresh pasta was great but again the tomato sauce was heavy because of butter I guess.  If you're looking for authentic Italian, this is not a place to go."

As of now my wife & I visited 2 different Scarpetta locations both NYC & Las Vegas & while both restaurants were great, Scarpetta in NYC blew me away!!! This time I tried the infamous Scott Conant spaghetti & must say, it was really good. The flavors were alive & the pasta was perfectly al dente. Very good. Still, the NYC location is better. Even the bread basket was slightly off in Las Vegas but still good. I guess the difference in chefs changed things a little. Not to mention service was a little lifeless & cold. Still I'm affectionate about Scarpetta. In NYC that is lol."

However, my prediction was soon proven wrong.\n\nWe arrived and were seated immediately in a comfy booth facing the windows. Our server quickly came to our table with bottled water and began to introduce himself and the restaurant to us. His delivery was smooth and made us feel welcome.\n\nHe took our wine orders, brought out the vino and listed off the specialties of the house for the evening. Soon after departing, a waiter came to our table and delivered the first batch of goodies. A basket of treats with artisan baked focaccia, bread with salami and oozing cheese baked right in and a selection of dipping sauces. We quickly devoured one of each and were in carb heaven.\n\nWhen our waiter returned we put in our main course order of their famous spaghetti and the Short Rib agnolotti. He refilled our wine shortly thereafter and let us enjoy some conversation and spectating.  This place was buzzing at 10pm with eye candy and low-lit cool vibes.\n\nFinally, our main courses arrived. The spaghetti is unforgettable with thick noodles, creamy reduced marinara and a touch of fresh basic. The short rib agnolotti, the little perfectly packaged pockets of braise short rib and hint of horseradish bursted with slow cooked flavor.\n\nOverall, the staff, food and ambiance was something I won't soon forget next time I am in town."

Didn't have a fork, but ended up using 2 plastic knives as chopsticks to eat at my desk in front of my computer while I worked. First bite I had,  first thought was, \"OMG!!! This is the worse pasta I have ever eaten in my life!  I can't believe I'm eating this!\"  Then I proceeded to eat half of it, constantly thinking, \"WHY AM I EATING THIS!!?!?!\" before I finally throw the rest of the contents away in disgust.  Why write about this experience?  Because throughout that experience, I kept thinking of the best pasta I had ever eaten which was the spaghetti at Scarpetta.  The texture, consistency, taste, and bite of the pasta was AMAZING!  The sauce was awesome, had a little bit of a kick to it.  I have to admit I have had better sauce, just barely, but that's because I really like a lot of garlic in my sauce, but the combination of the sauce and the spaghetti was incredible.  The rest of the meal was very good, the tomatoes & burrata dish, short ribs, polenta with truffles and assorted mushrooms, black cod with roasted tomatoes and fennel, coconut pannacotta, and cr\u00e8me brule were all excellent, but that pasta kicked this restaurant up another notch.  If you make reservations, ask for a window seat since we had an amazing view of the water show at the Venetian."

My dining experiences have ranged from a two-seated table with the view of the Bellagio fountains to the private chef's table with the view of the kitchen.  I've had the typical a la carte menu to the seven-course tasting menu.  If I had to choose my favorite experience between them all, my personal preference is the two-seated table with the a la carte menu.\n\nThe service here is very prompt and attentive.  From the Managers to the wait staff, service is priority here.  Shout out to Kelly, the General Manager, as she personally knows how to take care of her customers.\n\nTo start off the meal, you are presented with a one of my most favorite bread baskets ever.  The three accompanying spreads are vey unique and delicious. Their stromboli bread is sinfully good.\n\nMy personal favorite dishes:\n-  Roasted Sea Scallops:  Simple and well executed.  My only complaint is the size of the portion.\n-  Spaghetti:  Simple, clean, and classic.  FYI, the pasta is al dente.\n-  Risotto:  Slightly al dente, yet creamy at the same time.\n-  Tagliatelle:  Comforting dish that is full of flavor.  My personal favorite.\n-  Fennel Spiced Black Cod:  Flaky yet bold in taste.\n\nIf you are looking for a restaurant with a sexy ambiance, delicious food, and excellent service, come to Scarpetta.  It's my personal \"go to\" spot for dinner dates."

I would at least expect the steak to have some pizazz. \n-wine list: very extensive and reasonable range of prices to accommodate. \n\nService: \n- it was good. nothing exceptional. the best service I have ever received is from a Tom Colicchio restaurant - I wish all high end places would follow suit!  \n\nI would probably come back here to give it a second chance, but I am in no rush."

I couldn't find any other review mentioning take out/to go orders and on Yelp, they're listed as not offering take out. The kids in our group really wanted pasta though so I thought I'd call to see if perhaps the information on Yelp was incorrect. They do in fact accept take out orders. The lady who answered my call informed me that she could take my order over the phone or I could come in and order at the bar. \n\nOrdering was easy and I found the staff to be welcoming and knowledgeable. Scarpetta is known for their spaghetti; however, the regular spaghetti sauce does have dairy and the noodles have egg. They removed the cheese and subbed in gluten free noodles to accommodate the kids' allergies. I myself had the duck and foie gras ravioli. All of our orders were delicious and definitely comprised of quality ingredients. It took about a 10 minute wait to make our order.\n\nI'm glad that they offer take out because they were the only restaurant in Cosmopolitan that readily noted that they offered gluten free options. From my past experience with Scarpetta, I know the restaurant itself isn't meant for kids. Therefore I appreciate that we could still enjoy great food in our hotel room and avoid potentially disrupting fellow patrons' dining experiences. Only caveat is that the serving sizes are on the smaller side - arguably not really a surprise for fine dining. The thirteen year old inhaled his serving of spaghetti and the two year old easily finished half of hers in one sitting."

He also likes to wear extremely tight unbuttoned shirts that makes him look like a distant cousin to the Czech brothers that Dan Aykroyd  and Steve Martin used to play on SNL in the 70s.  But for restaurant week 2011 we stopped by here, lured by the promise of $25 spaghetti so perfectly delicious, that it makes Jesus weep.  \n\nSadly, the spaghetti did not make anyone weep and did not live up to the hype.  In fact, my wonderful husband actually said that my marinara sauce that I routinely rip off from Mario Batali and Anne Burrell, is much better.  I personally was not a fan of the thick noodles, but I thought the sauce on Scott Conant's version was better than mine.  To each their own, really.  But yes I am slightly marking down my rating for the over-hyped food.\n\nOther than that, most of the other dishes were just pretty good, but the  bread basket with the eggplant dip and the truffled mushroom polenta were absolutely spectacular.  Honestly, you could come here and only order the polenta and mooch off the bread basket, and you will have a pretty hearty and filling meal for a decent price.  \n\nSo I'm happy that Scott Conant's restaurant in Las Vegas was better than I thought it would be, but his Jesus spaghetti is just ok.\n\n."

            "review": "I wanted to love Scarpetta, I really did. I was still mesmerized by the striking view I got to take in during the grand opening and determined to prove all of the reviews about the mediocre service wrong, but our waiter left me no choice but to report otherwise.\n\nI want to point out the highlights before I rip Scarpetta to shreds. I came in for Restaurant Week so got the pre-fixe menu and chose the yellowtail, short rib agnolotti, and coconut panna cotta. I thought the yellowtail had great flavor and was presented beautifully. My only complaint was that it seemed to be served a little on the warm side to me which is a concern when it comes to raw fish.\n\nThe coconut panna cotta/guava soup was not only delicious but beautiful too. The almost tart soup was a nice contrast to the creamy panna cotta-probably the best panna cotta I've ever had! Not too rich or too sweet, and again, perfectly balanced with the cold fruit soup. I usually don't go for dessert soups, but I'd probably come back just for that.\n\nThe view is killer-great front row seats to the Bellagio water show!\n\nNow for the bad.\n\nStrike one: Maybe this is just me being very nitpicky, but the presentation of the short rib agnolotti was just gross. The pasta was served in a wide, shallow bowl and the appearance of pasta in one thin layer with hardly any garnish (save the breadcrumbs which had a nice flavor) was just unappetizing. Also, the pasta was incredibly greasy. I've had pasta in brown butter sauce before that didn't look like that. The filling was good, very rich and flavorful, but the sauce was just off-putting. \n\nStrike two: for the duration of our dinner, a toddler continuously screamed at the top of his lungs, banged on the table, stood on the booth in which his family was sitting and annoyed the crap out of the surrounding diners. As a fine dining restaurant, it's your responsibility to make sure that the experience is just that, fine dining. Which means if you need to tell this family who cannot control their spoiled infant to beat it, in the interest of preserving the experience for surrounding diners, then do it. After an hour of embarrassing behavior and ugly stares from other tables, the dad who was elegantly dressed in board shorts, shower shoes and a baseball cap removed the child from the fine dining situation. I feel like the management should've handled this earlier, but God forbid they offend one person who is offending the entire restaurant. \n\nStrike three: our waiter was a dud. I get it, everyone has their off days, but I think this waiter's life was a series of off days. I'm hoping that his service standards weren't lowered because we were getting what was essentially a discounted menu, but I can't help that think this was the case. Discounted menu=less tip? Not always. But if your behavior warrants a tip to match the discounted bill then that's what you'll get. It took about 15 minutes for bread to come out and for the waiter to bring water. Then another 15 minutes for him to take our order for wine. And about another 20 minutes to take our food order. I shouldn't have to flag you down and tell you we're ready to order. That's not my job as a patron of the restaurant. I wasn't in any rush, but those lapses in time mean either this dude was just straight up inattentive or suffering the early stages of dementia. Everything about the dinner just dragged on unnecessarily. He was inattentive and seemed disinterested in our table-there were only two of us and we're definitely not high maintenance so I'm not sure what the issue was.\n\nOur waiter was in no way personable and just rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe we caught him on a bad night. Maybe he didn't feel like we deserved the attention that someone who was ordering off of the regular menu did. Regardless, in these economically unbalanced times, when so many people are opting to eat cheaper or stay home and cook, I feel like the restaurant industry should feel the pressure to give diners the experience they pay for. Even if we were getting your dishes for a reduced price-we are still dining in your restaurant and your standard of service should be equal across the board. You are a fine dining restaurant and I hold you to a higher standard than, say a Denny's. But if you perform like a Denny's waiter, I will tip you like a Denny's waiter. \n\n\nI'm not sure I would come back because I was truly annoyed with the service. Maybe I'd come back for the guava soup...and have it at the bar."

I had the duck/foie gras ravioli and my wife had the New York strip steak, absolutely no complaints and the service while IN the restaurant was solid.  Paid the bill with a card (lets say it was for $200.51) and went home to the kids.  This was on 2/27...\n\na couple of days later I viewed by bank transactions and I see that on 2/28 I was charged 2 additional times for equal amounts (let's say they were both for $140.51).  I liked the food but I didn't like it that much to go 3 times within one weekend.  we're a middle class family who doesn't have that kind of income to justify that kind of spending.\n\nso naturally I called my bank to dispute the charges and I called the restaurant since apparently they have to be on the phone to corroborate my story and fix the problem.  Since the restaurant is closed in the daytime I elected to leave a vm.  A few hours later I did receive a return call from someone who seemed genuinely apologetic and she said that the night manager would have to be the one who can truly solve the issue.  she asked if I could be patient and wait a few hours until they can get back to me....this was on 2/29\n\nToday is 3/9, it's now been a week and two days later and I'm still waiting for that night manager to call.  I left a second voicemail today on the same line and my family is short roughly $280 in our checking acct.  so I had to call my bank again and explain how I still haven't gotten a call back and they did tell me that once my monthly transactions clear I should be able to dispute the charges and possibly get my money back next month.\n\nif you're looking to go out for a nice dinner with your spouse/significant other I would think twice before going to a restaurant whose service level goes down to 0 once they have your money"

The bar is a great room of lights, atmosphere, and helpful people. While staying there we had many custom cocktails (Scarpetta creations) that the bartenders made that were delicious. We also enjoyed the bread, which they said came for D.O.C.G., which was fabulous. The bread was homemade and there were several different types, all of them great flavors. We ate their spaghetti and their ravioli, both were excelt. The cost of the meal and drinks was around $100. It was a little more than i usually spend, but when you buys drinks it can become alot more. I thought for the spot it was at, the food quality, and the atmosphere the price was right on. I would highly recommend this place, and if you already had a meal and just relax there with some of their drinks."

If I were to base my rating just on the ambiance and view of the restaurant, I'd give it a 5. \n\nUnfortunately, the food wasn't impressive for the price. I had the pici and shared the creamy polenta. The pici had a really good chili pesto sauce. The pasta and lobster was perfectly cooked. But I expected the dish to wow me and it didn't. My favorite dish was the polenta. It was delicious. \n\nOur server was friendly. I think it's worth a try, especially if you can get a view of the fountains. I think there are other restaurants in Vegas that are great and better priced. I'm not sure I'd come back."

We enjoyed some awesome wines and some desserts, which hey mistakenly sent to our table, so they ended up comping those and bringing more, it was very good.  \n\nThe cool thing about this private room, is that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it and it is located next to the kitchen, with glass floor to ceiling so you can see into the kitchen as they work and cook and the background is a view of the Bellagio Fountains and the strip.  \n\nThe second occasion was for our company dinner a few nights later since they were able to accommodate our group of 16 in the private dining room that is in front of the restaurant and our big boss loves Italian food.  \n\nAlthough you can order single entrees off the menu, we had our waiter set up our dinner family style with some of his recommendations and some of the things we wanted to try.  \n\nAlso, our big boss had a request for something off the menu and the chef obliged with no problems.  Keeping the boss happy is always key!\n\nWe had the following dishes.\nApps - Braised short rib of beef, Creamy polenta, Raw yellowtail and Tuna Susci\nthe short ribs and the polenta were my favorite, the Susci was just ok.\n\nEntrees - Duck and Foie Gras ravioli, Short rib agnolotti, Sheep milk ricotta agnolotti.  All were awesome, but the duck and foie gras raviolli is very rich.\n\nWe had dessert, but I don't actually remember what I had.\n\nService was great and except the bar was slow, so they comped certain drinks that didn't show up in a time fashion.\n\nThe minus one star was for the Sommelier, who seemed to enjoy the sound of his own voice and didn't really consider the requests of the guests at the table.  I understand he is very knowledgeable and he is an expert, but he could dial back the ego and work with the guest.  \n\nOther than that, great place, I recommend it and you will not be disappointed."

It was good. Not what I expected, but it was quite tasty. An excellent starter.\n\nSince I wasn't paying, I ordered the veal chop which comes with a side of spaghetti, squash, and mushrooms.  Cooked perfectly and it was delicious.\n\nAlthough I was full my host had ordered a banana souffle and I hated to see it go to waste.

The service was strong, maybe a little too intrusive at times, but overall very good.  \n\nWe went with the polenta with mushrooms as an appetizer, spaghetti, and duck ravioli.  The bread bowl to begin was just your typical bread.  I'm not sure why there is such great reviews for it but it was pretty average, albeit perfect dipping utensils for our appetizer.  The polenta was a great started and had a cream of mushroom taste.  The spaghetti was the best spaghetti I've ever had but it's still very plain.  The ravioli was wonderful.  A little chewy inside with freshly made pasta.  And it was actually quite filling which was very surprising considering ravioli is usually a small dish with only about 5-6 large pieces.  This dish came with about 20 medium sized.  I recommend that dish to anyone.  \n\nThey have an extensive wine menu specializing in Italy but from all over the world.  This is one of your better Italian restaurants on the strip.  It has the European feel not the New York feel, so if that is the type of cuisine you're after, then give it a try.  It will run you at least $30/entree, $15-20 for appetizers, and $15 for a single drink.  My tip is to make a reservation and try to get a view of the Bellagio fountains."

The three stars are given more for the ambience then the food. Our table looked out to the Bellagio and we were able to watch the fountain show as we dined. \n\nGreat disappointment fell over me as I began to eat the Farmer's Market Salad. Beautiful yes, full of wonder fresh veggies BUT unless you got a mouthful of pecorino in every bite it was severely under seasoned. \n\nWe both ordered pasta dishes. My bf the duck foie gras ravioli and I the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti. The pasta itself was light and delicious. The Marsala reduction on the duck foie gras was a little powerful over the duck flavor but overall a good dish. However, the horseradish flavor in the agnolotti was so overpowering it left my palette craving to be cleansed after each mouthful. \n \n\nI'm glad I tried Scarpetta but based on this visit not sure I would be willing to give it another opportunity to disappoint."

Yes, something as simple as a bread basket was quite possibly the highlight of our meals. \n\nI went with 2 girlfriends and decided on one duck and foie gras ravioli, one spaghetti, and one tagliatelle for our meals and a polenta with mushroom fricasee to share. So we're waiting for our food and they bring out the bread basket and some butter, olive oil, and eggplant tapenade. Ok, pretty standard. But once we opened up that napkin, we were pleasantly surprised with stromboli, rosemary bread, and biscuits piping hot from the oven! The stromboli was a perfect blend of crispy outside and soft buttery inside, with the salami and cheese adding the perfect amount of salt. If that wasn't good enough, the rosemary bread. WOW. I absolutely love rosemary though so I may be biased. Anyway, we asked for another basket of bread and polished that one off long before our appetizer even touched down on the table. \n\nTo start, we ordered the polenta with mushrooms and our server told us it was just a small bite meant for one person, but the 3 of us were able to share it without wanting more. At this point we were already getting full! Finally our entrees came and everything was on point. The rich duck/foie gras ravioli, the clean but complicated flavors of the spaghetti, and the fresh, crisp spring veggie tagliatelle. Amazing. You really can't beat fresh pasta. I paired my meal with their pinot noir which was a great complement but I barely even remembered to drink it because I was so enamored with the food. Next time, I may try not to eat as much bread...oh who am I kidding. It's too good!"

If you are thinking about a romantic dinner overlooking the Bellagio fountains, this the restaurant to choose.\n\nAdditionally when you go before Christmas the hotels all tend to put their restaurants on a rotation since it is slow season.  Scarpetta had been closed for 10 days until the night we went.  When I had made my reservations i mentioned it was my gal's birthday and would like a seat near the window.\n\nWe got there for our reservation and a table with 3 people showed up after us.  They were given a window seat.  We were given a table 3 rows away from the window and next to the waiter station.  We had a limited view of the Bellagio Fountains. The place is pretty dressy casual and there were a couple who had old jeans on sitting by the window.\n\nWe were limited on time as we were trying to catch a show at the Bellagio.  The one thing to note is that our waiter was attentive to that point and never pushed us on dessert, but did apologize a couple times for the slowness of the kitchen during the meal.\n\nWe ordered our drinks as well as our meal in one fell swoop. As we were in a rush at the night was young, we ordered the yellowtail and tuna susci with caviar for appetizers and  had the duck and foie gras ravioli and diver scallops with foie gras for main courses.  Everything came out slow and we were rushed!  We had two drinks before appetizers finally came and I knew something was wrong and didnt want to ruin the evening.\n\nThey brought out the yellowtail but then a full tin of Russian caviar with toast points...etc.  Fortunately we love caviar.  Unfortunately this was not going to be a simple $150 meal!!!  I did not want to and maybe should have said something but we had had a few drinks and I did nit want to ruin the special evening planned any more.  \n\nThe Duck and Foie gras ravioli was good but not as great as it sounds.  it was just too tempting to resist. I love duck and I love foie gras but I guess it didn't work well together for me.  The scallops were good too.  Now that California has lifted its ban on foie gras I can now more easily pass when I see it on menus.  The yellowtail appetizer was just okay as well.\n\nNow the caviar was awesome but it is something I would rather have at a nice cocktail party and not on my own dime.  I am still wondering how that was put on my ticket because it was nowhere on any menus I saw.  My $19 dish turned into a $225 dish and my bill came to over $500 for two!  Ugh!!!\n\nYes it was a special night, but very costly!"

It didn't taste like a fine dining dessert. The banana bombolini tasted like banana pudding, so that wasn't good either. My husband tried the chocolate cake and he thought the presentation was lacking and the cake was only okay.

They were very thoughtful and divided the portion in half on a separate plate. For the entree, we ordered the Spaghetti ($25) and Pici ($36). I wasn't expecting much for the pasta because I thought, \"I mean, how good could it be? It's just pasta.\" Oh boy, was I wrong! The Spaghetti was a simple dish, but the sauce was creamy and fresh. The Pici was hands down, the best pasta I've ever had! It was worth every penny. The pesto was so delicious and went really well with the lobster. The lobster was soft and tender. Both of the dishes were not overpowering with cheese or sauce, which I really liked. I think they also make their own noodles. They were very chewy - in a good way!\n\nOn top of the wonderful view and food, the waiter was really friendly and funny. He was very down-to-earth and honest about his recommendations. Scarletta was such a pleasant experience - I think the best restaurant I've been in Vegas! Cannot wait to come back here again."

We had some really good dishes here and would definitely recommend, especially if you like seafood with pasta.  Service was friendly but timing a bit off with the fish coming out way before our pasta dish and them forgetting about our side dish.  Still, solid 4 stars!\n\nTheir free bread basket is one of the best - nice variety of plain and some with some nice, Mediterranean-inspired filling. You get a triple-dip tray of olive oil, a savory tapenade, and mascarpone! \n\nThe Berry Smash cocktail is sweet with the mix of blueberries and white cranberry juice.  It goes down smoothy but a few minutes you will get the buzz!  \n\nFor apps, we shared the grilled octopus. It was tender, well-seasoned of course and what made this dish a winner is that their olives and potato condiments also had a nice balanced taste. Olives not too briny nor salty - just perfect.\n\nI got the Branzino with saffron broth, a pretty good dish albeit on the lighter side.  It had some nice clams and shrimp pieces to go with the fish, which was cooked perfectly and seasoned enough for me.\n\nMy wife's black pasta dish with sea urchin and crabmeat however, was outstanding.  It looked super rich and tiny at first, but after mixing everything up it turned out to be very filling. Best of all, it wasn't super rich.  This has got to be one of their signature dishes - why need sauce when uni and crab meat are already perfect together.\n\nFor dessert we shared the mascarpone cheesecake and Greek Yogurt (sorbet?).  Excellent dish that easily feeds two.  We dislike dense cheesecake that tends to be too heavy and rich, but Scarpetta's version was light and smooth.  It almost had a panna cotta texture.  The Greek Yogurt was sweet and chilled and reminded us more like a side of ice cream. No reason you can't make a sorbet or have Greek Froyo I suppose. Wonderful dessert, and perfect end to a great dinner."

We even arrived a bit early but they had our table ready and were able to seat us right away. We had an awesome seat by the window across from the fountain and basically had dinner and a show. It was perfect. Service was good, water was constantly filled, plates taken away and made sure we were doing okay. Food was so-so... yes, I said it... it was just okay. I had the duck and foie gras ravioli and the bf had the short rib agnolotti. I actually enjoyed his dish more than my own.. but both pastas were only okay. Somewhat lacked flavor, or I just might be more of a tomato sauce kind of girl. I did however enjoy their assortment of bread and the butter, and other dipping sauces they had. That was delicious and we had to have two servings of that. We also had a Caesar salad which was delicious and had a hint of lemon flavor that was refreshing."

Mango Granita, Pistachio Brittle\".  When you order cheesecake, you expect to get a sweet creamy cake made from cream cheese, right?  Not here!  It's GOAT CHEESE people!  So if you like goat cheese cheesecake you'll love the cheesecake at Scarpetta.  Most of the food was actually pretty good (4 stars worth) but because the stupid bald older waiter of ours failed to tell 2 of us who ordered the cheesecake that it is made from goat cheese, AND THEN proceeded to argue w/ me saying that \"goat cheese\" was written on the menu...uh NO it was not, can you read English?!...that took it down a notch for me.  Not sure I'd go back myself.  If I do, I'll make sure not to have that guy wait on me again."

            "review": "SCARPETTA....OH HOW I TRY TO AVOID YOU!  Yes that was deserving of all cap's. \n\nSo let me just take you back...oh say 5-6 years ago. I was living in NYC and somehow ended up at an \"italian restaurant\" with no sign (or a very small one) and had the best spaghetti...EVER. I was whisked away into the night without ever knowing the name of the restaurant/where it was (forgot, ugh).\n\nFast forward like oh... to a year ago when I had the pleasure of dining at Scarpetta here in Miami where I now live and A HA! I somehow had the same spaghetti that I had all those years ago. Immediately I'm like \"holy ___(insert adj here)____\" this is the best spaghetti...EVER and that was when my love/hate relationship with Scarpetta all began.\n\nLove - in the sense that the food is heavenly and even after eating PASTA (carb overload), I yet still seem to be able to squeeze just a little bit extra onto my plate (whether it be dessert or what have you). It's not the type of pasta where you just peel over and die after because you just stuffed your stomach to maximum capacity. The flavors, heavenly. It's hard for me to justify paying for pasta. I feel like it's the absolute easiest dish to cook in the world (equivalent to a damn bowl of cereal) but at Scarpetta honestly, I would pay more. I stick with the regular spaghetti (trust me on this one).\n\nHate - in the sense that let's face it people...you're eating a plate full of carbs! Yes my body screams at me as I take every bite of the spaghetti...but it is like drug without the negative consequences (like oh say loosing your kids, family, job, and basically whole life). With this pasta, you just loose a few hours of your life while you are chained to a stair master all day to work it off. Believe me, if you haven't already figured this out by my review so far, let me break it down for you, it's worth it.\n\nI suggested to my girlfriends that we all go to Scarpetta...\n- they're all like \"well you're the elite girl so we have to go where you want to eat\" (and this is coming from girls who only eat like salads) and I'm like ok this is our food cheat weekend, remember? (girls vacation) and they're like \"mmmhm\" and so then I'm all like \"SURPRISE! It's pasta time\" Well of course one of the girls was like \"ohhh hell no\" and stuck with her healthy fish (arctic char) but my other girlfriend caved and had the spaghetti with me (muy bien). The friend who had the arctic char (it was her first time eating it but went with it because of the suggestion from our waiter) really enjoyed it. She said it was absolutely delicious. The spaghetti? I don't even need to say...you already KNOW.\n\nWe had wine and mimosa's and blahblahblah it was amazing.\n\nALSO, I am not sure if this will still be available but there was a tasting course menu which looked TO DIE FOR. However, the entire table needs to ALL order it (duh) so if you have a group of people possibly looking for a course-tasting meal, DEFINITELY CALL AHEAD and get their menu for it. The spaghetti is ON IT along with scallops and a bunch of other things all for a very reasonable price (compared to other course tasting meals like say at ohh... Le Cirque). \n\nDefinitely try out Scarpetta. From start to finish, everything was perfect."

The ambiance at this sophistocated Cosmopolitan restaurant is very sexy, and we were fortunate enough to be seated by the huge picture window with views of the Bellagio fountains spraying in the background.  To enjoy your meal at Scarpetta as I did, follow these instructions and thank me later:\n\n1) Start of with a glass of Gosset.  There aren't many wines by the glass to choose from on the menu, but a glass of Gosset (even if it'll set you back $20 for a singular champagne flute of this nectar from the gods) is worth it.\n\n2) Sample the fritto misto and Wagyu beef tartare to start.  Sure, these are old Italiano standbys, but they do it up here, adding cured egg, parmigiano, toasted hazelnuts, and sea salt to the tartare.  SO GOOD.\n\n3) Devour the black farfalle (with Maine lobster) and the spiced duck breast (with endive, preserved orange, and delicious cippollini onion).  I split these dishes with my friend and it was the perfect portion size, not to mention SCRUMPTIOUS.  Jersey was a good choice to wear during this meal.\n\n4) Polish it all off with the Zeppole for dessert, if you're a fan of Nutella.\n\nGrazie mille, Scarpetta, for a wonderful experience!  I will definitely be back to try your famous spaghetti."

We arrived about 15 minutes early and were sat right away. We were given a table by the window which allowed us to enjoy the Bellagio fountain show (about three times during our meal!). The wait staff was attentive and very nice. They offered advice about portion size and house favorites. Bread is served as you are seated, and it was delicious and fresh. The bread basket even includes Stromboli! Yum! We ordered a bottle of wine - a very good selection to chose from. My husband ordered the duck, and I got the short rib agnolotti with a side of broccoli rabe to share. Both meals were amazing! The atmosphere was modern yet casual. It felt sophisticated but comfortable. We will definitely be recommending to family and friends!"

The appetizers were very limited and if you don't like seafood, tartare, or mushrooms it will be a challenge to find anything you can eat.  I wasn't able to find anything which was a bummer.  I was also surprised that there wasn't an offering of dinner salads or anything like that before the meal.  \n\nThe highlight before the entrees arrived was actually the bread, there is a warm bread that has some cheese and a salami or beef in it.  It tastes like fresh pizza bread and it is amazing.  I might visit again for this bread alone.\n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, I had the veal cooked medium.  It was good but the mustard sauce was a bit tangy and was not my favorite.  I tried to limit the amount that was on my veal as much as possible.  Otherwise, the veal was cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  It was not fatty and there was plenty of meat on the bone.\n\nFor dessert I enjoyed the Nutella & Vanilla Creme Bombolini.  I had no idea what to expect but it was like mini doughnut holes filled with either the cr\u00e8me or the nutella in the center.  The ice cream that came with it was banana and was quite good as well.  It was a great dessert to share and I would recommend this to anyone looking for an indulgent dessert.\n\nService here was great.  We were checked on frequently and the food was delivered promptly after ordering."

After trying cucina enoteca in Irvine, CA, I always have to compare every italian place to it and Scarpetta cannot compete. Cucina Enoteca is always a good half price cheaper! \n\nI also am NOT a fan of their service. My wine was forgotten and only came at the tail end of my dinner. For $18 a glass, this is unacceptable. I know waiters work long hours but it seem like everyone was crabby who worked there.\n\nI'll have to say though, the window view is pretty good as it faces the fountain of the Bellagio."

I have been watching Chopped for weeks and was curious what exactly does he think amazing pasta is. Well Scott maybe Pasta is the only thing you should stick to.\n\nWe have ordered the Hamachi, Tuna, Polenta, Foie Gras Ravioli, Black Cod and the Tasting Menu.\n\nLet's start from the beginning. First of all I would like to say that the service was beyond reparable. We sat at the restaurant for almost 3 hours. It took the server to give us the menu for about half an hour and every time we looked for him he wasn't there. After hinting and hinting that we would like our food right away the longer it took to the point where we just left.\n\nHere is the breakdown:\n\nHamachi: nothing special-Nobu beats this dish any day of the week.\n\nTuna Susci: If you think wrapping tuna over a bunch of carrots is creative-think again.\n\nPolenta: I really enjoyed this dish. It came in a small pot with a mushroom sauce on the side. This was one of my favorite appetizers.\n\nBlack Cod: it was A-OK. I wish it had more flavor and was more moist. I guess beggars can't be choosers. \n\nDuck and Foie Gras Ravioli: The dough was chewy and hard. The sauce on top ruined the whole dish in my opinion. The inside was tender and rich. I think if the ravioli were smaller and more tender it would come together better.\n\nTasting Menu:\n\nFritto Misto: A-OK. I like anchovies but I don't think this dish brought anything special to the table.\n\nSpaghetti with tomato and basil was the best dish of the night! It was tender, flavorful and tasty. I would have this again any day!\n\nDessert: the chocolate cake was dry and even with the gelato on the side it still left a bitter rough flavor in my mouth!\n\nWe tried a few other things which I don't even care to discuss on the Tasting Menu\n\nThe bread basket was also pretty amazing! It came with 3 sauces which we ordered a second round of!\n\nOverall I am not impressed by this Italian Restaurant. This has nothing to do with price or the atmosphere. I think as a food critic what you look at is the freshness of the food and the service. I have seen a lot of bad service but ignoring your patrons will not bring you very far.\n\nSo Scott Conant I am giving you a C+. You have been chopped!"

The lights are dim and there are curvy booths on the right side facing a long bar. The walkway is narrow but keep the eye on the prize at the end because that's where the true \"meat\" of the restaurant is. Tables and booths are snugly placed in a modern yet cozy dining area. For our group of 10, the broad shouldered guys probably felt a little too close for comfort to make room for all of us to fit, but it wasn't a problem for the girls. \n\nLast Saturday, we were in a mad rush to eat and run because we were trying to catch a 9:30pm showing of KA at MGM. Our dinner reservation was 7:30pm so we cut it close. We asked the waiter to divide our check between 5 couples and to make things worse, we did not sit next to our significant others. We brushed off the sommelier by accident because we wanted to find our waiter just to order right away. In spite of our group being a nightmare, they made our plans happen and with time to boot! The food was amazing, our checks were split perfectly, and the waiter even offered detailed directions how to get to our show quicker. \n\nThe duck fois gras ravioli and the short rib agnolotti were the two dishes my husband and I shared. We loved these dishes. The guys in our group ordered steaks which were all well prepared and the girls ordered appetizers and a couple dishes to share but I think Bry and I were the happiest out of the group with our choices, which is surprising because I always choose steak over anything. \n\nLooking back, I feel bad that we put the staff in a position where everything needed to be rushed but overall, our entire group was impressed with the food and service.

The \"brown butter\" in the description got me hoping for The Old Spaghetti Factory's Brown Butter Mizithra dish, but it was nothing like it. Rich, but not salty. And I like salty/savory. Best part was the crispy/crunchy texture in some bites. Hubs got the tried and true spaghetti. He liked it a lot. Noodles cooked truly al dente. Again, not as savory as I like, but... satisfied with the quality. I like super bold and flavorful dishes. This is definitely a restaurant for those with a more \"refined\" palate.

            "review": "My husband and I had a table by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains, which was lovely. The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated and feels warm and intimate. The background music was kind of random as it felt like Frank Sinatra or some jazz music should have been playing.\n\nI am going to start with the food because that is whats really important, isn't it?? The breads are a lovely way to begin the meal especially because they offer a variety of dips and breads. The citrus infused olive oil was divine as was the extra soft butter. The salami and cheese stuffed bread looked amazing but I don't eat meat so my husband was able to eat 2 pieces to himself. He said it tasted as good as it looked. \n\nThe menu is small but offers some great choices. We started with the beet salad and a root vegetable soup. Both were excellent and the presentations were beautiful. For our main courses, we had the lobster pasta dish and the cheese agnolotti with a truffle butter sauce. I loved the agnolotti - it was a simple dish that didn't have to try to be anything else. Butter + truffles = love. My husbands dish had generous chunks of lobster, a delicious sauce, and perfectly prepared handmade pasta. We were in foodie heaven with every bite. We were sorry we didn't get dessert but we were so full so only ordered coffee. \n\nIf this review was for food alone, I would give it 5 stars but here are some of the reasons why I wont give this restaurant a 5 star review: \n\nThe service was only OK.  It wasn't over the top as one would expect from this type of establishment. Our waiter was pleasant but did not  go over anything on the menu. I am sure other diners had a better experience b/c we heard him talking away with the table next to us. It was strange b/c he did not offer one recommendation to us nor did he talk about any of the dishes or how they were prepared. \n\nThe didn't \"sweep\" the table between dishes. Normally things like this don't bother me but we had bread crumbs on the table and when you are eating at an expensive restaurant you are paying for food and overall dining experience.  Which brings me to one more gripe, they didn't offer any extras like other expensive restaurants typically do. There was no Amuse Bouche (yes this is a French thing) but places like Tom Colicchio's Craft gives you a tasting to start with in addition to your breads. \n\nOverall: I would like to give this place 4 stars b/c the food was excellent but for the price and reputation, I was expecting a better dining experience. I am wondering if the Beverly Hills Scarpetta would be better?"

This was easily the best meal I had in Vegas, and quite possibly the best Italian I've had outside of my study abroad experience in Florence, Italy. It's got the perfect dining ambiance (perfect for a date with a significant other, or if you're me... your mom) with a view to boot (we watched the Bellagio fountains go off all night)!\n\nOur waiter was absolutely adorable and I don't know how they managed to crank out their food so fast, but we were in and out within an hour. I wasn't really in the mood for anything heavy, but I'm a sucker for carbs and a good pasta dish, so I went with the short rib agnolotti, and my mom had the tagliatelle. Hoooly mother of all that is savory and delicious! The portions seem small, but man that plate of pasta will fill you up just right, while saving JUST enough room for that nutella and vanilla bombolini dessert, which I HIGHLY recommend. In fact, I wasn't even quick enough to snap a pic of this delicacy for Yelping purposes prior to absolutely devouring it, so you KNOW it was good.\n\nThe night definitely wasn't our cheapest meal in Vegas by any means, but it was definitely worth the splurge."

The food.  \n\nWe'll keep it simple, the food was meh for the price, and we are the type of people who are easily pleased. We started with the spiced artichoke soup.  It was brought out looking beautiful but it was bland:  light, but very subtle on the artichoke flavor and little to no \"spice.\"  Our entrees were the tomato basil spaghetti and the tagiatelle, a truffle pasta with veggies.  For $24 and $27 respectively we were expecting the best tomato basil pasta and truffle pasta we ever had.  Unfortunately we were not blown away.  Neither dish had anything special going on with them, other than the spaghetti being a perfect al dente.  Then we chose the chocolate cake served with an almond gelato and salted caramel.  Nothing special, seriously so dissappointed, although \"happy anniversary\" was written so beautifully on the plate it almost made up for it.  Looking back we should have gotten the bananas fosters because we heard about how great it is but unfortunately we didn't, because my wife wanted chocolate.  We were told the souffl\u00e9 (bananas fosters), marscapone cheesecake, and the filled doughnuts were the top 3 deserts.\n\nWe appreciated the staff and the service and we tipped well at the end because of it, however when you spend $150 on a meal, with just 2 drinks, you just expect a bit more from the food."

Looks like the Asian guy in the last Rambo movie.  Think he's on The Mentalist or one of those types of shows.  He gave it to his straight ie. this dish is no good and try this.  Always appreciated as long as you know what you're talking about.\n\nDuck and foie gras ravioli - Despite being a foodie I am not big on the foie.  But this was a nice, rich, delicate dish.  A bit overpowering on the foie if you ask me but maybe I'm sensitive to that flavor.\nScallops - friends thought it was great.  I don't like scallops.\nSteak tartare - pretty darn good.  Believe it was a Kobe beef tartare.  Nice beefy flavor (durrrr) though the accompaniments could have been better.  No toast points, no creamy sauce, no capers, eggs, etc.  Seemed a tad plain.\nSpiced duck breast - waiter warned me against this as he thought it has too much cumin.  The cumin smell was indeed higher than even Master Yoda's midiclorian count but it's fate was not clouded by cumin taste.  The taste was strong with this one and more powerful than the waiter could ever imagine.  If anything, the cumin scent gave the dish focus, made it stronger.  (yes I like Star Wars)\n\nBig thumbs up to the bread basket.  There was one with salami or some sort of cured meat with it.  Yummy.  Not sure the marscapone butter was any better than normal butter but it was goody goody."

We even heard the chef shout out orders like hell's kitchen: One risotto, two spaghettis; we had a party of 9 for a birthday and they treated us like kings.  The waiter Titus was an amazing help and made the meal excellent.  The food that was prepared was spot on! I had the world-renowned plate of goodness known as the spaghetti, but let me tell you this is not your typical pasta dish.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the infusion of fresh tomato and basil all concentrated into the smooth pasta was a burst of flavor in my mouth.  For my appetizer i had the polenta that \"has been stewing in the kitchen prepared by grandma for three hours.\" It was amazing; the best polenta i have had topped off with a truffle sauce mixture with mushrooms.  For dessert, I recommend the panna cotta, like i say a great panna cotta's consistency should jiggle like a nice woman's bosom and this dish jiggled perfectly.  The melt in your mouth dessert with a hint of coconut was a perfect end to a grand evening.  GO here and try it over and over again because the spaghetti is addictive."

I'm sure there are other Vegas establishments more on the wow factor, but pricewise for food and the experience, yes. Please do visit.\n\nI came here with a friend and were able to request and get a seat by the window that looks over to the Bellagio water fountains. Pretty cool I must say.\n\nThe bread. Oh my. They serve awesome bread here! There was a piece of sourdough bread on top of the basket covering two pieces of warm wheat type bread, two rosemary focaccia, and our favorite, cheese and salami wrapped bread!!! This last one was soooooo yummy!! The awesome bread basket came with salted butter, a tomato tapenade, and olive oil. Oh my, we finished most of the bread basket, except the rosemary focaccia and had to ask for a second round of bread to accompany our meal! Yes, that good. The salami cheese bread was probably my most favorite thing for dinner lol.\n\nI ordered the Lobster Pici, which was good. There were large pieces of lobster meat in it! There better be if it costed $38! The pici was cooked perfectly. Nothing worng with this dish, but tasted like something I could have made at home. \n\nMy friend ordered the Ricotta and Mushroom Agnolotti. This was really good. I had a few pieces and the wrapper on the agnolotti was super soft! It should be since they make their own spaghetti everyday.\n\nMy first choice for entree though was the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli. Un/lucky for me, my other friend went to dinner before me and had some leftovers, which I was able to try. These little suckers were really good heated up so I can only imagine what they would have tasted like if I ordered at dinner and the plate set in front of me. Drools... So, I would recommend this dish definitely!!\n\nAll in all, a really good dinner! The staff was all super professional, accommodating, and attentive. Good job staff!"

We were 5 minutes late because we had to stop by the ATM which, by the way, is located right at the foot of the escalator by security. We were greeted by the hostesses and manager who were all friendly. The dining room itself was a lot smaller than I had expected. They were able to accommodate our request and we were seated at a beautiful 2 top with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains. Water glasses were immediately filled and a bread basket magically appeared with 3 accompaniments: citrus infused olive oil, eggplant spread and my fav, mascarpone cheese... way better than boring butter! Like everyone has already mentioned the bread basket was delish! We also got a bottle of red wine for a great price, $75. We shared everything and for some of the dishes they were actually able to split it in 2 so it would be easier to share! This was my first time tasting fresh pasta and you can most certainly taste a difference. There's a specific bite and texture that can't be compared to that dry stuff at the grocery... \n\n-Raw Yellow tail: 4 very fresh pieces!!! Love the salt sprinkled on it. And the pieces were actually pretty thick and not some skimpy thin little things.\n-Creamy Polenta with truffled mushrooms: Perfect balance of creamy and sweet. I liked it because it was more like a soup for me haha\n-Braised Short ribs with Risotto: tender chunks of beef. Tasted like this Korean short rib dish that I love. \n-Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli: My favorite dish of the night. It was so decadent and delicious. If you don't like the taste of strong cheese, you will not like this dish. The sweet Marsala sauce paired perfect with it.\n-Spaghetti: I'm sure some people have a problem spending $25 on a small plate of spaghetti but it definitely is something everyone should taste at least once. Light, fresh sauce with perfectly aldente pasta... It is because of this dish alone my boyfriend had been wanting to come to Scarpetta. He has made this recipe a couple times for me and I'm sorry to say but my boyfriend's spaghetti tastes exactly the same.. if not better. But then again my opinion may be biased HAHA\n-NY Strip Steak: It was a mistake ordering this because we were so full. We had to force ourselves to finish this dish HAHA At $55 though I didn't think the steak was THAT amazing.. It actually had some unwanted gristle on it. But I'm sure it would have tasted a lot better had we not been SO full. \n\nI really wanted to get dessert for him and they were going to do something special for us but we were already so late for our show and not to mention so beyond STUFFED.. We had to run out of there... literally, we ran out of there! \n\nService was amazing all night from our server all the way down to the lady who came around with parmesan cheese and chili flakes. But special shout-out to Paul K...the friendly food runner/expo who was so polite and quite knowledgeable about all of the food. \n\nTHANKS SCARPETTA! \nSCOTT CONANT, YOU ARE HOT \n;ppp"

We tried the spaghetti, which was super plain - literally just noodles, a light tomato sauce, and some basil. Granted, it was well-made, as the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. But seriously...I don't think anyone should have to pay close to $20 for a mere plate of noodles, especially one that doesn't even have protein. We also tried a short rib dish in an attempt to get in some protein, but the portion size was laughable and the short ribs weren't even that good. I've had much better short ribs at other New American restaurants before. Had we not been staying at The Cosmo, I definitely would have gone elsewhere for my Italian fix instead, considering how expensive and just whatevers this place is. Do yourself a favor and skip it!"

Awesome. \n\nI love beef tartars...especially the korean/japanese yuk-hoe, so as an appetizer, I decided to order the Wagyu Beef Tartare and for dinner I ordered the famous Duck Foie Gras Ravioli.\n\nThe server brought out an assortments of bread to soothe my appetite. There was sourdough, french bread, rosemary bread, and stromboli. The bread came with a trio of butter, tomato-herb salad, and a lime-infused olive oil. The stromboli was the bomb.\n\nThe beef tartar came out next and I was extremely underwhelmed by it. The meat lacked flavor and the side salad was too salty. There is also a cured egg in it, which I did not taste at all. I did like the hazelnut garnish tho. All in all, 2/5 stars for this dish. \n\nFinally, the duck foie gras ravioli came out and it did not disappoint. They were small pockets of ravioli stuffed with a mixture of duck liver and duck confit, all topped with balsamic vineger and scallions. The pasta was fresh and incredibly delicate. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. My only knock on it was that I was not full at all. 4.5/5 stars."

            "review": "Ate at Scarpetta's on a Wednesday night, week before New Year's so it wasn't packed, got seated by a really friendly hostess. Upon sitting down we were offered two types of water, nice touch. A few minutes later passed and we were greeted by the assistant manager Kelly, asked if this had been our first time and we replied yes. \n\nKnowing the Executive chef Dan Rossi, we were treated to having him select our food and then having his wine sommelier (Paulo) pair wines with each course. If you know very little about wines, like myself, I would highly recommend Paulo making the decisions for you, this guy is a master at his trade. Our wines complimented each course perfectly and it truly made the night one to remember. \n\nTrying to remember everything we ate would be a six page review so I'll just touch on a few must haves, not that we didn't thoroughly enjoy every dish, because everything was an orgasmic explosion of flavors on the tongue, but I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Polenta with a five mushroom ragu, unbelievable. Their signature spaghetti, out of this world. Ravioli's with Foie Gras and duck, I could have eaten 20. Some Carmel pudding dessert with this homemade salted Carmel toffee with crushed pretzels was insane. That was just a few of the fifteen things we got, also Fritto Misto, is a must. \n\nBasically your not going to go wrong with anything in this place, food is off the hook, service staff paid attention to every detail and the view of the Strip is the best. This will be on my stop every time I visit Vegas from here on out, period."

            "review": "I was very very excited to come here while on a girls weekend to Vegas. Both my friend and I thought this would be one of our highlights!\n\nUnfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype in our visit. My friend has a few food allergies. Their gluten-free menu was a great help, but we had asked for her to be contacted by the restaurant beforehand to verify that she would be able to eat there. She didn't need anything crazy, just a confirmation that very simple things could be accommodated. Things that have been easily done by Red Robin and other chains. Easy stuff. They called her an hour before our reservation and spoke for about 30 minutes.She was assured that the waiter would be notified of her needs and that her requests could easily be honored. Great!\n\nWe get there and are seated right away (despite being a little late due to traffic) but our waiter knew nothing about the conversation that had taken place just 30 minutes before. He went to talk to the hostess and everyone played dumb all around. Despite her requests being quite simple and her efforts to be an easy customer, we were made to feel like a great big hassle to everyone. \n\nWe split the raw yellowtail app and they messed up hers but quickly fixed it. It was so delicious though incredibly tiny even if we hadn't split the portion! There was a long delay for our entrees and the chef sent out a free salad during the wait. They also messed that up but fixed it. My friend had the black cod and I had the short rib angolotti. The cod was again a very small portion. The angolotti was a generous portion, especially given the richness. It was very good but we felt it overpriced for portion and quality, even for Vegas.\n\nI had asked for my remaining angolotti (about 2/3 of my serving, so a large amount) to be boxed up to take with me and not 5 seconds after the waiter had acknowledged my request, he stacked a bunch of plates on top of my plate and walked off, thus ruining my leftovers. I watched him to make sure he wouldn't unstack the plates and scrape off my food into a box. Luckily he did not. My annoyance was high and we had a show to attend so I decided to not make a fuss and just let it go.\n\nMy friend and I have eaten out many times at many different types of places with a variety of price points. This was the worst in terms of service at this type of restaurant. The food was ok. Maybe it was an off night, who knows. I wouldn't waste my time or money here again when we come back to Vegas."

That's how we roll! \n\nI've never had an entree here, I could leave most of the appetizers (except for a ridiculously awesome gazpacho), but the pasta is SICK. \n\nRatings:\n#1 Spaghetti with tomato sauce:  OK- how does he do it? It's some pasta, it's some tomato sauce. Why is this heaven? It's tart, rich, chewy- this could be a whole meal. I've scoured the interwebs and come up with a pretty good approximation of his sauce (hint, infused olive oil, fast cooking times, butter, fresh basil, and grated parmigiano play a big role). But that pasta, how is it fresh and al dente all at once? The waiters are all coy minxes about this one. \n\n#2 Foie Gras ravioli: Very rich, cloying in a good way: super umami and flavor town. This doesn't skimp on the foie. We love it. \n\n#3 Stracci- Leek and shellfish rough cut pasta. Subtle and awesome, the pasta is again the star of the show. It's silky and coated in a wonderful leek sauce. I'm a salt nut and thought this could have been more heavily seasoned. \n\n#4 Truffle tagliarelle- Special last weekend. We had to try it. This was almost too subtle. It was almost refreshing, which you wouldn't expect from a cream and truffle based sauce. \n\n#5 Lobster Black Farfalle- Actually, the truffle and the lobster were at around the same level for me. This was again very subtle, deliciously textured pasta, the lobster was happy, but not the star. \n\nIt's all great here, but if you don't get the spaghetti with pasta sauce, you're doing yourself a disservice. \n\nAtmosphere is fine, if you can, request a table close to the window to view the Bellagio water show. \n\nWaitstaff is generally good. The sommelier really upsells his wine, especially the expensive stuff, which is lame (I bet he'll tell you to try some Peter Michael stuff which is like 3x+ the retail here). But on the plus side, the wine he's chosen is truly good. We had an insanely awesome white burgundy and I have to stop this review right now to go look up the name."

I ordered the tasting menu because I was unsure about what to chose from the menu - there were quite a few dishes I was torn between and I decided to just give them all a shot since a lot of the items i wanted to try was on the tasting menu.\n\nThe food and wine pairing was a great experience.  The service was impeccable - they gave me extra dishes to sample in addition to my tasting menu.  The fresh made potato chips sitting at the bar was also a temptation that I kept on coming back for.  \n\nThe stand out dishes I tried that night were:\n\nPolenta - wow, never had I had polenta as silky as this before.  The mushrooms and sauce were perfect with the polenta.  I savored every bit of it.\n\nSpaghetti - this definitely hit the spot.  The noodles were hand made and the sauce was quite simple, but elegant.  A very simple dish but I was in love with it.\n\nShort Rib Agnolotti - The first few bites were surprising, but what I loved about it would be the kick the horseradish that was in the sauce gave it.  Each bit teased my tongue and I couldn't help but go back for seconds!\n\nSpiced Duck Breast - My favorite dish from all of the ones I tried that night.  The duck breast was very tender, had a bit of au jus in them and didn't have a game-y taste to it.  The duck breast was cooked to perfection, with the meat being so very tender and the skin having a bit of a crunch to it and the endive and sauce went so well with it.  \n\nIt was a lovely dining experience.  I wouldn't mind coming again and ordering one of these delightful dishes a la cart."

Like your eyes roll back and you carefully savor each bite, wishing the experience will never end? It's an ecstasy that only a few restaurants can deliver. This describes my dinner experience at Scarpetta, when I delicately pulled apart my fennel dusted spiced black cod. A bed of tomatoes and roasted fennel added a tangy zest to the fish. My lawd. This must be a dream. It's too good to be true!\n\nBAM! Snap back to reality. As I used my fork and knife to draw another piece of that tender cod to my mouth, I spotted a thin black line. Hmm, that's an interesting lookin' spice. Let me tug at it some more. Lo and behold, it was a piece of hair, and it was definitely not mine. The hair was embedded in the cod's skin! I politely informed my waiter of the situation and he apologized, then asked if I would like to replace the cod with a different dish. I just wanted another cod. I wanted to return to that euphoria I was experiencing before my foodie world came crashing down on me when I discovered that unfortunate piece of keratin. \n\nLike Forrest Gump says, sh** happens. I understand that, but I'm at Scarpetta. This is a high-caliber restaurant, one of the best in Las Vegas, owned by the famous Chef Scott Conant. It's not something I would expect to happen here. My waiter was professional though, he quickly brought out another cod (since my partner was already done with his dish) and our dessert was on the house. I totally appreciate these gestures. Yet, when my second cod arrived, it did not taste as heavenly as the initial one. I noticed that my second dish came out a lot faster than my first, which meant it was cooked in a shorter amount of time. The meat of my second cod looked a tad raw and it was almost rubbery in texture, not as moist and soft as my first one. There goes my foodie high. Womp womp.\n\nThe kitchen staff probably invested less time and attention on my replacement dish. I know there was a slight rush to bring out my cod ASAP since my boyfriend already finished his entree. However, I was still paying for this dish and it was executed poorly compared to the first one. \n\nThis could have easily been a four or five star review. We asked for a table next to the window and the views of The Strip and the Bellagio Fountains were stunning. So romantic and beautiful. My boyfriend and I started our dinner with the Tuna \"Susci\" with marinated vegetables and preserved truffles. This is essentially tuna wrapped around vegetables. It was almost like a sushi roll, but there was too much going on. We couldn't really tease out the tuna flavor.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti. It's cooked in brown butter, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs. He said it was good but not amazingly tasty. He was still quite hungry after finishing his pasta. \n\nThe complimentary Amedei Chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was decadent. The chocolate was not overly sweet and the almond gelato was creamy.\n\nIt wasn't purely the hair, but the fact that my second cod was unrecognizable compared to my first one. The rest of the items are pretty solid. The view is the best thing Scarpetta has to offer. And maybe that black cod...when it is cooked properly."

Therefore, I don't trust him... half kidding\n\nI think Scarpetta is more like 4 stars, but I knocked off a star because our party definitely felt a little sick after eating here. Maybe it was an off day (we think it's from the cheese in the potatoes of a side dish).\n\nUndeniably a beautiful spot to eat. The large windows display the neighboring Bellagio water fountain show, where my girlfriends and I packed into one side of the booth, so we could watch and eat at the same time.\n\nOysters West Coast - good, fresh raw oysters. I loved the horseradish sauce that came with it, and a gravy boat of tabasco was brought to us upon request\n\nStracci - a flat noodle pasta with lobster, crab, shrimp. There were generous portions of seafood and the pasta and tasted creamy/good.\n\nDuck & Foie Gras Ravioli - I actually have to go against the hype to say that it was just okay, and not that great. The dish was a tad bit colder than luke warm, and just the richness of the foie gras/drier duck made it hard to finish the whole dish. Maybe a couple bites and I was pretty much done with it :-P\n\nBlack Cod - So soft and melted in my mouth (I think I ate a cloud..). \n\nRibeye of Beef 24 oz - For $62, this had better been some good ribeye. Although I know that Scarpetta doesn't specialize in steak, I thought it was a bit overpriced for it being standard and nothing special.  Even though it was medium-rare, the steak was still a tad tough.\n\n**don't fill up on the bread** Scarpetta has fantastic bread. The bread basket had 3-4 different kinds of breads, one of them being a melted roll of salami and cheese (a meal itself). And the bread came with mascarpone butter (LOVE), eggplant dip, and olive oil\n\nOne of the better restaurants in the Cosmo. Did anybody realize the restaurants in the City Center area (Cosmopolitan, Vdara, Aria) are not that great? Hmmm"

            "review": "Restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip are known to be overpriced, underwhelming, and catering to free-spending high rollers. As a local, I often try to avoid these tourist traps. The expensive menus often provide amuse-bouche after amuse-bouche-sized appetizers and minimally larger entrees leaving you wanting more (quantity). So, I was pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant that finally live up to the bill. I've been wanting to try Scarpetta since seeing its dineLa menu back when I lived there for a short while last year. My girlfriend surprised me with a birthday dinner here with an awesome table overlooking the Bellagio fountains. She was specifically interested in their signature tasting menu, which we later found out was not offered on the weekends. However, after speaking with the chef, our waiter was excited to let us know that it was available. \n\nFor $110, each person gets a 7 course meal complete with an amazing bread basket and they even added an 8th course (or side dish). Three of the courses feature their signature dish including the scallops, spaghetti, and duck. Dinner starts off with a bread basket, which our waiter warned us not to devour. Having experienced fine dining before in Vegas, I completely ignored his advice and dug in. The best piece was the meat and cheese-filled stromboli. The bread spread came with marscapone butter, eggplant caponata, and citrus-infused olive oil. Since my girlfriend is gluten-free, I pretty much ate the entire bread basket myself. No regrets.\n\nNext came the first course: a duo of  yellowtail and tuna. These two pieces of fish were just plain amazing. The pinch of sea salt really elevated the flavor of both pieces. Clean and simple. The diver scallops is a classic dish with a nicely seared scallop atop cannellini beans, and mushrooms. This came with a wonderfully fragrant side of the most creamy polenta with truffles I've ever had complement of the chef. The third and fourth courses were the freshly made spaghetti with tomato & basil with a shared plate of the short rib agnolotti. The spaghetti was simply perfect, the pasta version of a wonderful margherita pizza. My favorite dish of the night was the agnolotti. These small pasta morsels were filled with tender short rib and topped with brown butter and horseradish bread crumbs. My girlfriend compared these to chicken biskit crackers if you close your eyes. At this point, I was starting to get full. The fennel dusted black cod and spiced duck breast courses were a blur. I was getting delirious from the food coma I was about to enter. God, why did I eat that entire bread basket. I had to box the duck breast and muster all that I had left to prepare for the dessert. The amedei chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato was the perfect ending to a marathon of a meal. \n\nThe experience was fantastic and this is by far the best value you will get on the Strip for a prix fixe meal. Both the food and service were extraordinary. A must-try restaurant for any special occasion (or if you're just looking for a fantastic treat)."

We had a great view of the fountains, our server was very nice and had no problem getting a new salad for my friend who did not like the one she originally ordered.  Drinks were about average priced for any nice place in vegas, avg. $16 each. My friend got a cosmo and she said it was perfect.  They had a good bourbon selection for my picky husband.  I got the branzino and it was very good. My husband got the waygu cap steak that was on special and loved it! Still talking about it.  I think it was about $65, it filled him up. We did not get salad (extra, not inculded). My friend got a caesar and it was beautiful! Loved the presentation.  They both get the filet and they said it was perfect.  Tip, 2 entrees and I think 2 drinks was $156. Not the most we have spent on a meal.  FYI for weddings, they charge between $6- $13 per person to bring in your own cake."

The food was amazing and deliciously consistent with the New York location, but you're in Vegas!!!  \nIt's nice they have seasonal items so there is always something new to try.  I started with the autumn vegetable soup (dreamy and creamy), my husband had the tartart special.  He loved it and wouldn't share.  Then we had a pasta course, I can't stop getting the spaghetti.....i can't!  Colin got the short rib agnolotti, which was very buttery good...  Then we had the nerve to share the 24 oz ribeye,  it was soooooo good, tender and perfectly seasoned.  We actually ate it all!  plus the sides, horseradish mashed potatoes....\n\nMario, the manager was extremely nice and helped us out with a service problem we experienced on our last visit and made everything perfect for this visit.  We did not expect the extra desserts brought out for us to try.  You have to try the little donuts (bomboloni) and the coconut panacotta was very tropical with a guava sauce...My favorite group, Depeche Mode was playing and when they found out, they changed the playlist to only play their songs!  \nThere are so many choices of places to try in Vegas and this is a must.  Worth every penny and worth several more visits."

            "review": "So while at a convention in Vegas, my two co-workers and I came here for dinner on 10/6/13 on a recommendation from a friend who claimed it's the best restaurant in the city. All three of us did the tasting menu ($110 per person) and two of us opted for the wine pairing with it (additional $45 per person). With all the delicious looking options on the menu, it seemed this was the way to go. Here's what was included: \n\n-DUO OF YELLOWTAIL AND TUNA \"SUSCI\". Wine pairing: Adami, Prosecco, Veneto, n/v. The \"susci\" was the first tasting and my least favorite of all. Nothing special to me. Or at least I didn't get what was supposed to be special about it. The roll with the carrots was kind of gross actually. I was hoping things would turn around quickly, and they did. Ohhhh they did.\n\n-ROASTED DIVER SCALLOPS, MORELS, SUGAR SNAP, WATERMELON RADISH & PEA FROTH. Wine pairing: Iberian Remix, Albarino, Edna Valley 2009. \nThe scallops were cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the puree that was served on the side. My friend however didn't enjoy the wine that was paired with it. He's a big Albarino drinker and said it tasted like \"it was sitting on the shelf a little too long.\" I didn't really notice that until he said it, but I have to agree. That could have just been a bad bottle though and not an accurate representation of the wine itself.\n\n\n-SPAGHETTI TOMATO BASIL & SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI. Wine pairing: Il Poggione, Rosso di Montalcino, Tuscany 2008. I don't care what anyone says- the spaghetti was fantastic. I'm drinking the Kool-Aid here. Yes, the sauce is very simple, but it really made me notice and appreciate the texture and freshness of the noodles more. Sometimes spaghetti is better when it's simple I guess. I would definitely order it again. \n\nThe short rib agnolotti- dish of the night. The three of us unanimously agreed on this. One of the best pasta dishes I've ever devoured in 10 seconds. The horseradish breadcrumbs were a great finishing touch.\n\n-FENNEL SPICED BLACK COD, CONCENTRATED TOMATOES, MANTECATO & BLACK OLIVE OIL. Wine pairing: Jermann Red Angel, Pinot Noir, Friuli 2008. \nThe cod was spiced well, but maybe a tad undercooked for my liking. I still finished it. \n\n-SPICED DUCK BREAST, ENDIVE, PRESERVED ORANGE &\nCIPPOLLINI. Wine pairing: Feudi di San Gregorio, Rubrato, Aglianico, Campania 2009. The duck was perfectly cooked and had tremendous flavor. My friend sitting next to me was already so stuffed by this point, that he couldn't eat his, so being the fat fuck that I am, I ate his too.\n\n-AMEDEI CHOCOLATE CAKE TOASTED ALMOND GELATO. Wine pairing: Quinta do Noval, Colheita, Tawny Port, Portugal 1997. I'm normally not a big dessert guy, but this cake was outstanding. Perfect way to cap off the tasting.\n\n...and here were a few complimentary items our table was given to share:\n\n- BREAD BASKET. It was served with three different dips (citrus olive oil, tomato-eggplant, and marscapone butter). Some of the pieces of bread had salami baked into it, and those were amazing! Just try not to fill up on them if you're doing the tasting menu, because you have A LOT of food on the way.\n\n- CREAMY POLENTA WITH FRICASSEE OF TRUFFLED MUSHROOMS. The polenta was definitely one of the highlights, although it could have benefited from being a tad thicker since the mushroom sauce liquified it significantly, once mixed  in. But great flavors, nonetheless.\n\n- SHOE STRING CALAMARI AND ZUCCHINI. I think there was some fennel in here too. We finished every last string.\n\n\nAll three of us immensely enjoyed the tasting menu. To say that we were not left disappointed by the portion sizes would be an understatement. We could barely walk out of there without toppling over. I certainly didn't have much room for alcoholic beverages for the remainder of the night. Probably a good thing, knowing me and Vegas.\n\nYou might notice I didn't have much to say about the wines. That's because unlike the food, they were all pretty unremarkable. I'm a pretty avid wine drinker and I didn't recognize any of these wines by name before they were poured for me, so it was almost expected. If I ever did the tasting menu again, I'd most likely skip the wine pairing option and just order a bottle of something decent and familiar off their wine menu. \n\nMy biggest gripe about this place was the waiter. Although friendly and accommodating, he could barely be heard over the background noise, and with his thick accent, it made him very difficult to understand. Tastings obviously are supposed to be interactive and I had to ask him to repeat everything he said at least once. This became a little frustrating and kind of depreciated the experience for me. I wish he had left a copy of the menu on our table so I didn't have to go to their website afterward to finally discover what some of the things I ate were.\n\nThe bottom line is I would definitely return to Scarpetta, especially since I just realized there is one in Beverly Hills (doh!)."

The scallop appetizer was perfectly paired with the foie gras; the beets and burrata appetizer had elements of sweet, savory, and sour (provided by the vinegarette).  But my favorite part of the meal was the simple, fresh spaghetti.  So divine.  The fresh ingredients and pasta sings in every bite.  I would eat this for breakfast lunch and dinner if I could.  Panna Cotta and Bananas Foster souffle to finish.  We left stuffed and happy.  Ready to take on Vegas!!  There is a gorgeous side view of the Bellagio fountains.  However, there is a large bar that extends the entire window so it perfectly blocks your view if you sit beside the window.  Why the designer would not just put floor to ceiling windows, thereby providing an uninterrupted view is beyond me."

Either way, it was ALL fabulous.\n\nBesides the incredible food, the service was fantastic. Our server was so sweet and helpful. The view was amazing.

Seriously. I need my foie gras.\n\nWith the recent foie gras ban in California keeping me from one of my favorite delicacies, I definitely wanted to have it if I was crossing state lines.  Scarpetta stuck out to me because it wasn't a French restaurant, but an Italian one, which is my Mom's favorite... and a great way for everyone to be happy.\n\nScarpetta was perfect. Situated in the new and beautiful Cosmopolitan hotel, it has an amazing view of the Bellagio and definitely has that upscale \"we are dining somewhere really fancy\" vibe.  The server was really enthusiastic about the dishes and described them each eloquently (I read one person's review that found this annoying, but I thought it was great!) and helped with recommendations for what to order.\n\nStarter:\n\nPOLENTA with Mushrooms. Oh. My God. To DIE FOR. Seriously.  Wow.  Best dish of the night and that's saying a lot because everything was great.\n\nMains:\n\nDuck and Foie Gras Ravioli - Obviously what I ordered and obviously I loved it.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the portion size. Usually when you order ravioli you get like, 4, and are left being hungry, but not in this case. It was a generous portion.  I would have loved there to be more foie gras but that's just being greedy.\n\nFennel Spiced Black Cod - My mom ordered this and it was probably the least interesting thing that we had, but still delicious.\n\nBlack Tonarelli - My sister ordered this and it was also amazing, al dente, just as it should be.  It took about 10 minutes to come out after the rest of the dishes and they kept apologizing profusely for it and then sent out TWO free desserts to make up for it.\n\n(FREE!) Desserts:\n\nMascarpone Cheesecake - lighter than your average cheesecake, which made me like it more.\n\nAmaedi Chocolate Cake - like a lava cake, but better.. the perfect texture / consistency with hot melted chocolate inside... served with almond ice cream...\n\nThis was one of the best Italian meals I've ever had outside of Italy,  and I've tried all of those overrated high end Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. I was expecting much less, thinking this was a bit of a tourist trap that I was buying into for the evening. It ended up being so much more. I was so pleasantly surprised and happy with the experience. Also, no BS portion sizes.. these are hearty portions and you will leave full.\n\nDefinitely one of my top (if not the top) Italian restaurants outside Italy.  I just may need to go visit the Scarpetta in LA."

One of my girl friends requested that we dine at The Cosmopolitan on our Vegas getaway, so I picked Scarpetta because it was spendy but not quite a splurge like \u00e9 by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s or Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill.\n\nAs far as Italian food goes, Scarpetta was scrumptious, though overpriced like everything on the Strip.  My girl friends and I were seated at a big, chic horseshoe booth--and if it weren't for our next destination (dancing at Tryst and XS), I likely would've drank and ate more here. \n\nFor my appetizer I had the spring pea soup ($16) with gulf shrimp, guanciale (Italian bacon), and reisling gelee.  It was the most delicious pea soup I've ever had in my life! Incredibly balanced, fresh, flavorful, and masterfully presented.  \n\nFor my main I had the duck & foie gras ravioli ($26) with marsala reduction.  I absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but I could barely taste the foie gras, let alone the duck.  I did appreciate, however, that the pasta was homemade.  Crystal L.'s main course, the short rib agnolotti ($25), with brown butter horseradish and toasted breadcrumb was a much better choice for pasta--I was so happy when she literally gave me half!  I knew then and there that this was going to be a wonderful night!\n\nIf you like classic trattoria fare, I wouldn't go to Scarpetta.  But if you don't mind fancy, modern Italian, look no further."

The restauraunt is beautiful and has a great view overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. I started with the wine list. I had read one review on yelp from a reviewer complaining there were hardly any bottles of wine under 100.00, I thought the wine menu was really varied and there were many price points to choose from, types, regions. This is a fine dining restauraunt so what do you expect. I chose a Riesling from France that was perfect with our food. \n\nThe bread, holy Jesus the bread. They have about four different kinds they bring out (and keep bringing). There is a roll with salami inside that is literally to die for. The bread is accompanied by mascarpone butter, citrus infused olive oil, and some sun dried tomatoe compote. All wonderful. We started with oysters that were fresh and perfect. \n\nI ordered the Black fettuccine with seafood (crab, shrimp, squid) and it was incredible. This is a dish with few ingredients for a reason, fresh seafood and house made pasta really don't need many other players. I forced my boyfriend to order the special, a lamb ragu over fettuccine after we argued for five minutes (I won). This was the best ragu I have ever eaten, hands down. Incredible, we inhaled it. The portions are really good, it looks small when they present your plate but there is a lot of pasta I could hardly finish mine. \n\nFor desert, you have to try the strawberry soufle, it literally melts in your mouth. We also had these little light donuts filled with with banan creme and Nutella. Enough said. \n\nThe waitstaff was wonderful, very warm and attentive. Our waiter was fantastic, everyone was. \n\nYou have to make a reservation ahead for this place, we landed in Vegas on a Wednesday and the cosmopolitan concierge had to squeeze is in."

I was heading to Vegas in a few days and realized that Scarpetta was also in the Cosmopolitan, so I decided to make reservations for the group of 8 that I was with. (Walking through the Cosmo later that day I noticed Chef Scott Conant who is the owner walking into the restaurant which is nice to see the care for his restaurant)  So after arriving a few minutes earlier than the rest of my party, I decided to check in with the host. After talking for a minute he mentioned to me that they had the Chef's table available if interested, to which I responded YES! As we walked through the dining room passing many full table we entered a private room with floor to ceiling glass with a few of the kitchen and the other wall was the same but with a few of the Bellagio fountains which was beautiful.  Soon after the waiter and sommelier (Noel) entered to find out which wine that we would like for the evening. I didn't deal the \"wine man\" but did enjoy a nice Cabernet with my dinner. Good choice sir. Waiter placed some delicious bread (even from being from NY) along with a mascarpone butter, citrus infused olive oil, and eggplant caponata. All were excellent. On to the primi piatti, we ordered a few for the table including the tuna susci, Mediterranean octopus, braised short ribs, and polenta. All were fixed to perfection, the octopus stood out to me because it's a very delicate item and easily under or over cooked. The short ribs had a hard time staying on the bone. Tuna was cubed and paired with avocado, close to a perfect bite. I will only speak for myself when it comes to my entree which was the famous Spaghetti with tomato and basil (unfair to call it a sauce when it's so much better than just a sauce.) Living in nyc all my life where pasta is \"supposed\" to be the best I'm very picky because most Italian restaurants don't put any care into the dish. QUITE the OPPOSITE, on the record going to say probably best pasta dish I've ever had. Seasoned fantastically, silky/savoy tomato/basil, pasta was cooked perfectly. $24 dollars seems like a lot but if you taste how good it is...you'll probably think it's one of the best deals in Vegas next to the $9.99 lobsters. Everyone else at my table seemed to enjoy their various pasta dishes( orecchiette, tagliatelle, pici). Only 2 problems. ONE the waiter was hard to get a hold off and didn't stop in frequently enough, probably due to being secluded in the chef's table room. TWO my girlfriend order a souffl\u00e9 for dessert and it was slightly raw, which was taken back. Besides those slight setbacks I've really it was an excellent experience. Definitely would go back especially after missing out on the foie grad ravioli. Soils 4 stars!!! Good job Mr.Conant!"

This place is my favorite restaurant in Vegas.  Spaghetti is worth it.  Polenta is so good although overpriced. Duck ravioli is good. Almost everything on the menu is good. Service is good and its a very nice setting.  Would come back....many times!"

Scott Conant runs a tight ship- he's my favorite Chopped judge.\n\nHighlights include the spaghetti (yes, it's pricey but worth it imho) and the agnolotti with truffles (doesn't seem to be on the menu at the moment).  On my last visit, I had a special tarragon pasta dish that was out of this world.  The stromboli bread from the bread basket is pretty fantastic too.  Have not been to the other outposts so can't compare consistency."

We were able to get a booth in the designated bar area that was a bit more casual than the beautiful main dinning room.  Oh \"Little Shoe\", how pretty you are.  Ambiance:  4 stars.  \n\nWe started with a few appetizers:  The Beet Salad (2.5 stars) that my friend said was just okay and average at best; The Chestnut Soup (4 stars) was actually quiet nice and sort of like a bisque with nice chunks of pickled brussel sprouts that I usually never have, but really enjoyed; and The Braised Beef (3.5 stars) with fall root vegetables and faro risotto.\n\nOne dinner entree was the Tagliatelle pasta (3.75 stars) with fall root vegetables, truffle zabaglione and guanciale (Italian bacon).  This was the lighter of our three dishes and came in 3rd place.  The runner up dish was the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli in a marsala reduction (5 stars!)  Wonderfully rich and decadent, like buttah!!!  We thought the best dish was the Short Rib Agnolotti (5 stars!) of brown butter horseradish.  A stellar dish that had such an intriguing zing of fresh horseradish.  Giddy up little doggie, giddy up!!\n\nService was okay, a bit non existent initially and it took awhile to get two additional settings for our party of three; then ask for a missing bread dish.  Other than that, the waiter made his Italian wine recommendations that turned out to be not bad.  Service:  4 stars.\n\nTally:  \nAmbiance:  4 stars  (\"New Romantic\" 80's music, a tad bit loud)\nBeet Salad:  2.5 stars\nChestnut Soup:  4 stars\nBraised Beef:  3.5 stars\nTagliatelle pasta:  3.75 stars\nDuck & Foie Gras ravioli:  5 stars!\nShort Rib Agnolotti:  5 stars!\nService:  4 stars\n4+2.5+4+3.5+3.75+5+5+4= 31.75/8= 3.97 stars."

It might not be fair as this place isn't equal to some of my 2 star reviews (it's probably better than most), but for the high price-tag....I think it's justified. The best part of my experience was my $20-a-glass wine. The $$ amount is to be expected in any nice place in Vegas, and I was happy that the wine was at least very good for the price (as they aren't always). Service was so slow, it took almost twenty minutes between being greeted and for the waiter to come back for drinks, and then the same wait from drinks to food and food to the check. We were on a tight schedule being on a work trip, so this was a little inconvenient. It wasn't even busy yet, either. For my food I split the Tagliatelle which I felt lacked in truffle flavor and their signature spaghetti dish which I felt lacked in overall flavor and should not be their signature dish. In general the food was not bad in any way, I just thought it was very expensive for what it was and for the lack of great service. Generally not a bad experience and I might be willing to give it another shot when back in town."

A fantastic choice. It was served some clover, chick peas, and a slice of octopus that was so tender, I couldn't believe it! The squid was rolled up plated with some greens as well. It was delish!\n\nThe pasta we chose was the house speciality - tomato and basil. It was so fresh and so basil-y! There was just something about it - almost creamy, but not creamy. The texture was all to do with the tossing of the pasta and sauce with a little EVOO as a second step. Yeah, I asked. \n\nFor dinner I chose the veal chop, and I'm so glad that I did. It was cooked perfectly and was just the right size portion. My husband had the fennel crusted cod. It is prepared with the skin on, and was very nice (so he says, because I didn't get a taste!). \n\nThen dessert was a spectacle to behold. The anniversary trio was complete with chocolate-filled doughnuts, strawberry milkshakes, chocolate toffee brittle, and ice cream, too. It was unbelievable. \n\nWe will definitely make this a regular stop in the LV book!"

Which is strange because I never order Spaghetti when dining out, this ones special though. Black Tagliolini was delicious and some pasta filled with short ribs, I forget the name of it but it's different and probably isn't like anything you've had before. Order and share the Dry Aged Sirloin to accompany your pasta. It's a perfect fit, especially with the Spaghetti.\n\nDessert? Skip it. Had em all and not one I would order again, and by this point you'll have spent enough money.  Thought about giving Scarpetta 3 stars, not because of food but because of price, e.g. \"the handmade in house pasta\" spaghetti is $24. But I had to take into consideration of the convenience of being located on the strip and that location with it's great fountain views cost money."

BUT I have to give it to Scarpetta for changing my mind.\n\nWe came here in a group of six on a Sunday night. We made reservations like two hours prior, but we showed up about an hour early and were seated immediately. \n\nRight away, we were impressed by the variety of the bread basket and the dips. I can't remember exactly but there were about six different types of bread. What really got our attention though was the eggplant dipping sauce! It was so yummy that we kept shamelessly asking for more. I think we got at least three refills of it (but hey, we had six hungry girls!).\n\nOn to the real food... My friend and I shared the Lobster Pici and the Short Rib and bone marrow agnolotti. The pici is dressed with a chili pesto sauce, and since my friend can't eat spicy foods, they split the portion for us and served it on two separate plates. I got extra chili pesto on the side in case I wanted to add more. I loved that we didn't have to try and split our dish in half ourselves. So much more convenient and I can get straight down to eating! However, it turns out that the chili pesto sauce isn't even spicy at all. If anything, it's just salty, like REALLY salty. The pieces of lobster meat still tasted good and wasn't that salty, but the pasta sat directly in the pesto and it definitely could've used less sauce/salt.\n\nNow on to the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti... it was the last entree to come out! All the food came out already and the agnolotti was nowhere to be seen. We got sidetracked by the lobster pici and kind of forgot about our 2nd entree to share. When we realized, we asked the server where it was and if the kitchen had forgotten about it, but he assured us it will be coming out shortly. By the time it came out, everyone was done with their food. I'd say it came out 10-15 mins later than the other entrees. It wasn't so bad considering we were sharing another entree, but had we not shared, one of us would've sat there without food. Considering this is a fine dining restaurant, that is unacceptable. \n\nBut you know what, it was so delicious that I didn't care it was late. I think this has become my favorite pasta dish of all time. The flavor was very rich and smooth, with a little crunchy texture from the garlic chips. I personally liked it better than the duck and foie gras ravioli that I tried from my friend's plate. I would order this again and again. Luckily for me, there's also a Scarpetta in NY! Guess where I'll be going to dinner soon!"

Tender pasta, the sauce was perfect, and the duck and foie gras was in a perfect balance. \nFor our main course we had 2 orders of veal loins wrapped in pancetta and served with sweetbreads and roasted vegetables.

It was very well seasoned and tasted delicious, especially since it was my first time having veal. I got the Stracci, which was pasta with lobster, crab, and shrimp on top. If you're a seafood lover, then you'll love this."

I've been itching to try out Scarpetta for a while and made it a priority during my Vegas trip!!\n\nOMG!  Everything was bad.  I mean bad!!! The service was bad and lacking and the food didn't save the day either.  Let's just say I'd expected much more from you and maybe a meal at Olive Garden would've been a better choice. There was absolutely no seasoning in all of the dishes and the focaccia bread was drowned in oil.  The saving grace is probably your specialty bread.  \n\nWe ordered the short rib agnolotti and fritto misto as appetizers and both were mediocre at best.  For entrees I ordered the duck and fois gras ravioli and omg, I couldn't eat more than 4 pieces of it and I'm known to polish my plates.  My hubby had the octopus and it was ok but lacked seasoning again.  My daughter had your world famous tomato sauce pasta and the pasta was tough and needed salt!  Is it a bad day or is it normally like this?\n\nHands down the worst meal in Vegas.  HUGE disappointment!!!"

The wooden floors, leather chairs, and leather placemats gave an instant upscale but hip vibe. We ordered an appetizer, two pastas, a meat dish, a side, and a dessert. All handmade pastas, the chef was so kind and split all our dishes (even when we said it wasn't a big deal for us to eat family style), and the spaghetti was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. The spaghetti with tomato and basil was so good we got an extra order to eat later. Luis, our server, was incredibly accommodating and made sure our dining experience was unforgettable. He joked with us, told us each item we were about to eat, and sent us home happy customers."

If a restaurant can hit on all three of these, and do so at a reasonable price, they deserve a fifth star. Scarpetta doesn't even belong in the same sentence as some of the amazing Vegas hotspots. Lets start with the good- Scarpetta has a nice location with a good view of the strip and prides itself on a swanky and sleek atmosphere. Its dark, the jazzy music is loud, and the table settings a slick. The other \"views\" are good too- as the younger crowd will probably afford you a few peaks at some match.com dates happening around you. Your jaw will even drop as soon as you see the cans on the hostess, but its all downhill after that at Scarpetta.\n\nTo start, the restaurant was a hot box, so bring a wet towel to cool off. The service was atrociously impersonal and inattentive. Great restaurants have teams of servers constantly working your table, making suggestions, and guiding you through the experience. We had no sommelier to talk about wines with. Our waiter was a smug and unsmiling grump who detracted even more from the average food. The pasta dishes we ordered were step above Barilla pasta with some canned Ragu sauce. The beef tar tar was tasteless. How could some many be so wrong about this place? OVER-RATED! Clap, clap. Clap, Clap, Clap. If you want overpriced, average food with a forgettable personal touch slathered all over your plate- hit Scarpetta. If you want to enjoy a meal- look elsewhere."

We ordered wine which did not come until AFTER our first course. Finally our spagetti comes....oh, so SALTY...it tasted nothing like the last time. Our server must have known something was amiss as he never once asked how we were enjoying our meal. We also waited a good 45 minutes to be offered dessert---or the check by this time. We finally had to wave someone down to get the bill since we were DONE with this place.\n\nSuch a shame. We have had many great food adventures in Vegas, this evening was not one of them. If you really want to have some spagetti that will change your life then come out out to California and enjoy the Scarpetta at the Montage."

Let's not gloss over the bread basket like you would at most of your standard restaurants, this bread basket is special. Maybe one of my favorite parts of the meal was the stromboli bread, dipped in some olive oil and topped with the sun dried tomatoes, I could eat that all day.  \nAnother highlight of this meal was the braised short rib risotto primi piatti, this was a flawless dish. My best description of this dish would be, homey and earthy. The risotto had perfect texture and the short ribs were melt in your mouth braised.\nNext we had the spaghetti tomato basil and the duck & foie gras ravioli. Both amazing pasta dishes in their own right. \nThe spaghetti tomato basil did not disappoint, the homemade pasta had just enough bite to it and the sauce was simple but deep in flavors. The tomato sauce had a buttery richness to it, with a hint of spice from the red pepper flakes, and some freshness from the basil. It's truly a perfect spaghetti.  \nDuck & foie gras ravioli is very eloquent and rich. Very deep in flavors and a smooth velvety texture to the foie gras filling. The marsala reduction rich and buttery smooth in it's own right and when combined with the raviolli gives a Mike Tyson KO punch of flavor. \nI highly recommend Scarpetta. The prices are also reasonable when you consider the delicious free bread basket, which can be a meal in itself. A very delicious meal and romantic place take your significant other, what more could you ask for. Absolutely a 5 star restaurant.\n\nAs great as this meal was the one thing that stands out to me is the stromboli bread with the complimentary bread basket with olive oils and sun dried tomatoes."

You know, like how it inspired me to open a Yelp account just so I could tell everyone what a terrible experience I had. I've skimmed over a lot of positive reviews on here, so I'm kind of shocked by how crappy our experience was.\n\nIt earns one star for the solid cocktails (I had a Moscow Mule) and the delicious bread basket. \n\nThe service started out mediocre. We (me and two of my girlfriends) had an 8:30 p.m. reservation and arrived on time, but were still told to wait in the bar for 15 minutes despite seeing open tables. No biggie, we order drinks and hang out. \n\nWe're seated at 8:45 p.m., the waiter greets us, he's surly and disinterested. Who cares, the bread basket has just arrived and is delicious. The bus boy seems friendly and smiles. Everything is cool. Waiter asks if we want sparkling or still water. I say still instead of saying tap, and we get the $8 bottle. Ok, so it was a little sneaky but it's my mistake for not knowing to say tap. But no big deal, still eating the bread.\n\n8:55 - We order 12 oysters, wine, and our main dishes because we've already decided. One of the girls mispronounces her dish, and he gives her a look like she just asked which side Italy was on in WWII. He corrects her, she politely apologizes, and he tells her \"it's OK,\" even though clearly it is not.\n\n9:00 p.m. - The oysters arrive. There are 6 instead of 12 and a bus boy brings them out. We get no description and none was offered on the menu. We plan to inform the waiter about our missing oysters when he comes by again, but I guess he's done with us because he's vanished and does not reappear until we are well into the main course (which is really only 10 minutes later). No matter, we will not be needing any additional oysters as the first 6 were disgusting. Half are covered in red wine vinegar, it's unclear if there is actually an oyster in the shell as I can't taste it. The remaining three have three large chunks of ice carefully placed on top of each oyster, indicating the ice is part of the dish. The problem with having a huge chunk of ice in an oyster is that it makes you chew your oyster multiple times until you realize you are chewing an oyster.\n\n9:05ish p.m. - The main dishes come out. I ordered the short rib agnolotti and my friend had the duck & foie gras ravioli. The descriptions sounded better than the food tasted. The ravioli was overcooked. I can't remember what my other friend ordered as I didn't try it when she said it was also mediocre.\n\n9:15 p.m. - Our waiter materializes temporarily to clear our dishes and to fail to comment on the fact that we've left a substantial portion of our food uneaten. I receive the glass of wine I ordered with the appetizers.\n\n9:20 p.m. - Waiter asks if we want dessert, no thanks, and he drops off the bill immediately. Now he's all smiles.\n\n9:25 p.m. - They take a chair from our table to put together a table for an incoming party of 10, even though there are many empty tables with chairs surrounding us. We take that as our cue, throw back our wine and leave.\n\nThe result - we ended up paying over $200 for 45 minutes of so-so food and bad service. I've had worse service before, but never at a place that had the audacity to charge me this much. We also stayed in the Cosmo during our stay and the service at the hotel was pretty lackluster."

Might be better off with Carbone if that's what you had in mind. \n\nAfter our most recent Vegas trip, I've come to realize that a lot of what you pay for the many $$$ restaurants along the strip is the ambiance and the convenience of being on the strip.  The food itself is okay but not mind blowing, or at least not enough to justify the cost.  For that, I feel like you would have to go to one of the many famous $$$$ restaurants.  But who cares! It's Vegas. Scarpetta is really nice because of the view, but the food wasn't necessarily mind blowing.  The break-down:\n\nFritto misto: My girlfriend and I weren't really a fan of this. Seemed like a bunch of fried shoestrings served on a plate for $18 and not impressive. \nDuck breast: This dish was tasty, but nothing too special that struck out. \nPici: Yes! My favorite dish of the night.  Very flavorful pasta with an olive oil base and chunks of lobster on top.

After a rather disappointing dining experience at Mastro's steakhouse the night before, I needed some Italian comfort food! From the moment we walked in I was in love.

Instead we were lead into the main dining room which has a perfect view of the Bellagio and Bellagio fountains! We not only had an amazing dinner but also enjoyed the fountain show every 1/2 hour. \n\nNow on to the actual meal. First of all, the bread selection in the basket are delicious! There was a prosciutto and mozzarella roll that was just to die for! For an appetizer we went with the heirloom tomato salad. Yummy! Next up we shared one of the pasta dishes that was on special. I can't remember what it was called, which is unfortunate because it was outstanding. Next we shared the roasted chicken, also very good! We shared a side of the carrots which were great. The combination of honey and the crunch of the nuts made the cooked carrots really stand out. \n\nBesides the meal itself, the service was outstanding. Since we shared each plate our server made sure that the items were split onto two plates so that we didn't have to reach across the table to get bites of food. Our water glasses never went below half full and our server was very attentive. \n\nI will definitely visit Scarpetta on my future visits to Vegas."

Everyone we talked to before coming here said the spaghetti was awesome! 2 friends got that and it was okay, noodles slightly too undercooked and I like it aldenti, and two people got a lobster tagalini and their stomachs were upset after,  I got the roasted chicken and when I cut into the wing part it was bloody and I discreetly let the server know and he left the breast half with me and took back only the wing, he was gone for about 15 min, nowhere to be found, when he returned I explained that I wasn't eating the breast part and he explained that is the way they cook it, with his hand in my face I had to back my chair up, that was rude and not true, my Aunt got the same dish and hers was cooked through... I would not return after this experience."

            "review": "Simply Amazing.\n\n\nThere is a very tough choice when dining at the Cosmo because they have amazing offerings.  Scarpetta is one of those choices that I believe is a must.\n\nThe ambiance is very nice, and if you get there at a good time, you can request a table by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains for some dinner entertainment.\n\nThere were 7 of us in my party, so I got to try quite a few things.  Service was on par with any high end restaurant which is good.\n\nBread - They give you four variations of bread, all good.  The standout is the Stromboli.  The bread comes with three dips which are Eggplant, Olive Oil with Lime and Marscapone Butter.  The eggplant dip was amazing.\n\nSteak Tartar - This dish was fabulous and is my main recommendation for appetizer.  It is perfectly seasoned and finished off with a tiny quail egg on top. The toast points are also seasoned, buttered and toasted to add that buttery nutty flavor to the bite.\n\nFried Lemon Grass and Char - This dish was unique.  It was little strands tempura-like fried bits of lemon grass and fish mixed together.  I said Char because I believe that is what it was, but I cannot be for certain.  It was very simple and very good but I could take it or leave it for the price.\n\nScallops - Careful with this dish as you only get two.  I understand they are a luxury type item but for 21$ or how much ever it was, two scallops did not go a long way.  They were your average good scallop.\n\nFoie Gras & Duck Ravioli - The star of the night.  This dish was simply perfect.  From flavor balance, quantity of food, to execution...it was a hit.  If you come here and don't at least try it, you are missing out.\n\nFilet - The filet was cook medium rare (which is the way I like it) and was very soft as it should be.  That being said, it was a filet.  A normal good filet that you can get from any great steakhouse.  The star of that dish was actually the accompanying potatoes.  Mashed with garlic, sauteed spinach, sun dried tomatoes and a cheese that I could not recognize.\n\nChicken - OK yes, someone ordered chicken.   The one dish everyone always passes over at restaurants because...well, its chicken.  That being said, I was given about a fourth of the chicken because they were full and I must admit.  It was tasty as hell.  The skin is cooked on it to make it very crispy with seasonings that go a long way.  The bird itself was moist so that you had to use hardly any effort for it to shred apart in your mouth.  If I ever ordered chicken in a restaurant, this would be the one.  Its also a HUGE portion in terms of high end restaurant portions.\n\nI would go back here in a heart beat."

The pepperoni stromboli bread could've been a meal alone.\n\nFor appetizers we had the Braised Short Ribs, Raw Yellowtail, and Beet Salad. The short ribs were tender, flavorful, cooked perfectly, and had a good portion size. The yellowtail was fresh and so tasty with the pickeled red onion, LOVED IT! As for the beet salad, the best I have ever eaten. (Period).\n\nEntrees included the signature spaghetti (I will perfect this at home!), Duck & Foie Gras ravioli, and the 24 oz Ribey. The spaghetti was perfect, amazing, simple, delicious, and awesome. Our ribeye was cooked and seasoned so well, I was glad to get the last piece! The Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli...heaven in your mouth with blessings from on high...I have never been so pleased and I spent the longest time enjoying this dish.\n\nFor Dessert, we had the Crispy Sweet Risotto Crepes. These were surprisingly good and the sorbet was AWESOME! Perfect way to end the meal.\n\nI have been thinking about the Duck Foie Gras ravioli DAILY for the past 4 weeks, you have to try them."

We were seated near the entrance but still had a good view of the Bellagio fountains which became more spectacular as it grew darker outside. They had a nice assortment of bread to start along with a healthy list of specials that included diver scallops and foie gras, which my husband ordered. I started with the white corn soup with Dungeness crab which was sweet, buttery and one of the best soups I've ever tasted. For my main course, I ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli. My dish might have been better if I didn't try my husband's dish which had actual pieces of seared foie gras. Holy duck liver, Batman! With my dish, I thought that combining the duck and the liver in the ravioli just muddied the flavors of both food items that I found so enjoyable. We finished the meal off with coffee and shared a delightfully light mascarpone cheesecake.\n\nThe prices are a bit high, as expected from a fine dining establishment on the Strip, yet not prohibitive. The service was spot on, warm and unobtrusive. Let the waitstaff know if you are vegetarian or on a gluten-free diet and they will provide you a separate menu."

I couldn't really taste the duck. My least favorite of the night had to be the veal dish. The meat was dry and very lackluster.\n\nThe most amazing thing was the bread basket. It comes with a variety of dips and breads. There is one warm bread with salami embedded in the inside.

I started with a salad with burrata, mixed greens, beets and hazelnuts - well designed and delicious.  For my main course I had the babay goat (I think it's called capreto) - also excellent.  My table companions had the branzino (delicious) and the out of this world, must have lobster with black macaroni.  The desert was a chocolate cake, but the star of the dish was actually the accompanying gelato, served on some sort of chocolate crubms - yum\n\nthe bread here deserves a paragraph by itself.  Between the three of us we ate four baskets.  There was a big piece that they put on top that was good.  Inside there was bread with some kind of meat in it, delicious rolls, and then some sort of bread that they had toasted so that it was crispy - it came out crunchy and airy and was perfect with the marscapone butter.\n\nMy only complaint is that the wait staff hover around you and the second you finish something they come in an snatched the plate away.  It was very noticable - do they think that this constitutes good service?  But our waiter was excellent.  They have a good wine list, and the prices are good for this quality of food\n\nSo definitely go go go!"

The entrance is super secluded, and as the hostess led us down an empty hallway it seemed like the place was abandoned, but the hallway opened up into a large dining room.  We were seated by the windows and could see the Bellagio fountains which was nice. \n    I got the Berry Smash to drink which was very average, a little too strong for my taste.  The bread basket they brought out was great, focacia, french bread and one more were average.  The best bread had salami and basil and maybe even cheese baked into it- SO GOOD.  There was a citrus olive oil to dip in, as well as butter, and an eggplant tomato spread.  Definitely helped to liven up the more basic bread.  \n     The duck and foie gras ravioli were great.  First time having foie gras and we were not disappointed.  Rich and delicious.  The spaghetti was unreal good- I did not think spaghetti could be that great.  Finally, the veal chop looked great, and was very rich and tender.  The chocolate cake for dessert was probably the low point- it reminded us of an Applebee's dessert, although the presentation was slightly better than that.  \n     The only other con was our server- he was very awkward and seemed to appear at all the wrong times to talk to us about the menu.  He rambled on about dishes just a little too much.  \n     Would definitely have given a 5 with a different server and had we picked a different and hopefully better dessert."

Our reservation was at 9 PM and we were disappointed to find out that the chef was no longer offering the tasting menu that evening. Our waiter, however, said we could create our own tasting - excellent!  \n\nWe started with the polenta with mushrooms - delicious, but it maybe could have used a bit more salt. Next up was the infamous $24 spaghetti. Well worth it - this is the best pasta I ever ate. Since we were indulging, the next course was more pasta. The duck and foie gras ravioli. It was good, but very rich and not even close to as good as the beef cheek ravioli from Carnevino. I am not sure why people would compare the two. On carb overload we then had the lamb which was fantastic. For some reason they also sent out a duck entree which we had not ordered. Not a fan of the spices - cardamom and clove. Nor was I a fan of the waiter attempting to charge us for it. \nDessert was the chocolate salted caramel cake. Good, but nothing to rave about. \n\nWine prices are high but on par with everything else on the strip. \n\nOh, I almost forgot the bread basket and dipping sauces.

I didn't have a chance to check out Scarpetta when I was last here in November, so this seemed like a perfect time.  \n\nThe room is absolutely beautiful, and we were lucky enough to get seated near a window, so we could also watch the Bellagio Fountain show at the same time.  I was thinking, this night is going to be perfect right......maybe not.  So the server comes to take our drink order.  I'm a simple guy, so I just ordered a Miller Lite.......he kind of looks at me and is like \" Bud \".  I'm like ok, nevermind.  Can I get a Stella instead?  He's like Yup.  I'm like.... ok.  Then he leaves and the busser brings over the bread basket full of win~!  The bread was a salami roll, as well as some Focaccia, and what looked like some french baguette.  The busser really explained the different condiments they had for the bread well.  He had a thick accent, so it was a little difficult to understand, but he did a nice job explaining it.  He left and our server came back with the beer....a Bud.  I'm like...seriously, I just told you  Stella?  Then my wife's cousin asks him a bit about the condiments (mascarpone, some eggplant tapenade, and some olive oil) and if there is a certain one that is recommended for the different breads.   He's like I don't know, they're all good.  I'm like....seriously?  Then we get around to ordering our Apps and entrees.  We started with the braised shortribs and the fritto misto.....both were great.  The shortribs were very tender and flavorful.  The fritto misto,was crunchy and not oily either.  We then ordered our entrees. My wife and her cousin ordered the Short rib agnolotti, the cousins GF ordered the Lamb loin.  Haha, we could already tell how our waiter was, so for fun, she asked him how the Lamb was.  You would think at a nicer upscale restaurant like this, he would boast about the preparation, or the sauce, or how tender the meat was......nope.  When she asked how it was, he said \"good.\"  Really?  I thought restaurants made money by putting crap on the menu?  Anyways, back to lucky old me.  I asked the waiter about the Spaghetti with Basil (which is what lots of people rave about) or the Stracci.  He was like it's ok, but it's kind of plain.  Not sure if he was trying to upsell me, but I don't know if Scott Conant would appreciate one of his servers calling his food plain.  Anyways, I took his advice and order the Stracci.  Or did I?  Because even if I ordered the Stracci, that's not what was placed in front of me when the rest of the order came around.  I looked at the guy and was like \"didn't I tell you Stracci?\"  Oh, I'm not sure, let me check.  Seriously?  What the hell, can this really be happening.  Anyways, I waited patiently like a fool, while everybody else ate.  To Scarpetta's defense, all the entrees were really good and flavorful, just the guy serving us needed a clue.  We moved on to dessert and ordered the chocolate cake (a bit too heavy for me), the coconut panna cotta (awesome!), and the cheesecake (light, airy, completely delicious).  The waiter comped us an order of Zeppole's for his lack of service, and it too was great.  \n\nOverall, I was just disappointed that the service was so poor.  I was REALLY looking forward to having a wonderful night with family and friends, but it ended up just being ok.  Too bad"

Scarpetta does it justice. The \"black fettuccine\" is cooked to perfection and topped with king crab, squid, shrimp, and lobster corral breadcrumbs... ho l'acquolina in bocca. \n\nScarpetta also has the best Italian dessert I have tasted in years.

The prices are high for the quality of the food and the wine prices are exceptionally high.  In fairness, I have been generally disappointed with the restaurants in LV.  Getting close to NYC prices but unfortunately not close enough to NYC quality."

Nothing was amiss in terms of service and cordiality.  Was very tempted to try the famous $24 spaghetti again but decided to expand my horizons and try something new.  (Yet we still had the creamy polenta.. orgasmic). Boyfriend had the Sheep cheese ricotta ravioli with truffle shavings and I had the Prime Filet of Beef - Med. Rare w/ potato puree... fricken delicious! I was naseous for most the day.. even at the beginning of our meal but I scarfed down the steak and finished off most of my plate.  Didn't care so much for the rainbow chard as I found it a bit salty.  Boyfriend agreed.  We completed our meal by sharing the Coconut Panna Cotta w/ Guava Soup - so good and regreshing!  Would come back just for that on a hot day if I could.\n\nOur server was this tall guy w/ a beautiful Trinidad accent who had a very kind demeanor about him.  Forgot his name but make sure you get seated in his area. ^_^"

We are both big fans of eating out so we were very excited to come here. Our waiter was very attentive and we did not feel like we had to get his attention to order or get our check. One of the things I love about dining here is that they have one of the most extensive and delicious bread baskets ever (4 types of bread and 3 spread/dips). \n\nAs for the food and drinks, we ordered a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc which was reasonably priced compared to their cocktail prices. We shared the polenta to start, which the restaurant kindly split between 2 bowls for us, which was a very nice gesture. For our entr\u00e9es we shared the short rib agnolotti and the black fettuccini. Both dishes were delicious. However, the short rib agnolotti was clearly the stand out and probably my favorite dish here. On a past visit, I have also ordered their spaghetti which sounds plain but is super flavorful. \n\nWe were pretty full and did not order dessert, but based on a prior visit, I highly recommend the bomboloni."

It's in the Cosmopolitan. \n\nFOOD:\nComplimentary bread: Good variety, soft, addicting. \n\nTruffle Polenta (5): OMG can I have you every day. I could have left after just eating this and been so happy. So creamy and flavorful. Truffle flavor came out so well, and the extra crunch you get from the mushrooms made it perfect. Gorgeous dish also. \n\nSpecial-Cheese ravioli with black truffles (5 stars): Had to get the special since I love black truffles. They shave on a good amount too. The ravioli was really good and the black truffles and foam made it amazing. Very filling. \n\nChicken Entree (5 stars): So moist and flavorful. Seasoned almost like Mediterranean/Indian chicken. Really liked it.\n\nVIEW/ATMOSPHERE (5 stars)\nSat right against the window and saw the beautiful Bellagio fountains go up every 15 minutes. Gorgeous. Definitely request the window seats if you can. The place itself is nice and quiet. Great for a date night. \n\nSERVICE (5 stars)\nGirls who work at the front are both beautiful and nice! I was in heels and she warned me as I was walking that the back area was slippery, which it was! So if she didn't warn me I probably would have ate it.

He was knowledgeable, friendly, and humble.  I have seen far too many waiters in Vegas who don't care, or are extremely snooty because my husband and I look young even though we're not.  \n\nAs for the food, we order the scallops as the appetizer, and the duck and foie gras ravioli and the spaghetti as our entree.  For the scallops-I feel that it was good-but I have had better.  The duck and foie gras ravioli is their stand out dish!!  The wine reduction and marsala sauce on top of the ravioli made it so delicious.  The actual ravioli themselves are shaped like triangles.  I can tell there that is this delicacy to the outside when they were making it.  The duck and foie gras inside is very unique, and not like anything my husband and I have tasted before.  This dish deserves a 5 star.  Finally, for the spaghetti.  I was extremely excited to try this dish because I read all these reviews on yelp explaining that it was amazing.  However, we were a little disappointed maybe because we were expecting so much.  Don't get me wrong-the pasta is still good.  However, it's not the amazing that it was made out to be.\n\nOverall, if I could give Scarpetta a 4 1/2 stars, I would.  My husband and I will definitely be back if when we go back to Vegas."

My husband and I both had the Pici and it was the best pasta I have ever had in my life. Homemade pasta, cooked perfectly and while it was spicy, the spice didn't take over the dish and take away from the flavor. It had huge chunks of lobster in it and was well worth the money.  Bread was delicious as well, along with the eggplant spread."

But it was very good, al dente handmade noodles with the right balance of sweet and acidity of the tomato & basil sauce. \n\nAlso the field greens was rather good even though it wasn't listed on the menu.

            "review": "What a giant disappointment. We saved Scarpetta for our final night in Vegas because it was my first choice of a new place to try. We won't ever return.\n\nWe had reservations at 6:30. We arrived at 6:24. I know this because the hostess pointed to the clock and noted that she would seat us in 6 minutes, since our reservation was for 6:30 pm. They were not busy -- no one else was waiting to be seated and only two people were sitting at the bar. We had to ask twice to check a coat, even though they have a clearly marked coat check.\n\nAt this point, we just figured the hostess was inexperienced or having a rough day. Once we were seated, we were promptly greeted and placed our cocktail orders. Our drinks took almost 20 minutes to arrive -- although we could see there were fewer than 20 people in the entire restaurant and there were at least 5 servers standing around chatting. The rest of the night, the service remained scattered, at best. We were rushed through our first course, but had to flag down the server to order dessert. \n\nOn top of this, the server was constantly pushing us to \"upgrade,\" after telling us that most of the plates, as is, are pretty minimal and that most people end up having to add to them with a second round of orders. For example, I ordered the fritto misto salad, which runs $18. The server warned me I should order a second primi, as well. He wasn't kidding -- I got two bites of greens with a dusting of lemon and seasoning. In short, the portions are small even for an upscale, trendy restaurant.\n\nThis place has one saving grace: the tomato and basil spaghetti. I admit I'm pretty picky about Italian food after I lived in Italy for a summer. I understand that it's rarely as good in the States. Although it's not as good as you'd get in Italy, the tomato and basil spaghetti is done well here. It has a nice light sauce (it's not arrabbiata -- it's a pureed sauce), and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.\n\nI had the strawberry souffle for dessert. It was adequate, although it was fairly cool by the time they got it to the table. The coffee was fine, but the server forgot the extra shot of Frangelico I requested.\n\nOn the plus side, it's really beautiful. If you can get a seat in the windows, they overlook the Bellagio fountains (unfortunately, the window seats also overlook the Bellagio gardening sheds and dumpsters...so don't look down!). Overall, the decor fits in well with the contemporary vibe at the Cosmo. It's urban, beautifully designed, and hip. It's fresh, upscale, and open without being fussy or stuffy.\n\nAs beautiful as it is and as great as that pasta plate was -- I won't be back."

We were able to get a good reservation on a short notice, and were seated near the window overlooking the Bellagio fountain so that was a nice touch.\n\nServer was extremely knowlegable and even shared some additional knowledge he had about the Sommelier. Turns out he is one of four master sommelier's in Las Vegas, and has his own vineyard. Nice guy to chat with.\n\nNow the food... We started with the Yellowtail, moved on to the Black Farfalle, and ended with the Aged Sirloin. Yellowtail was awesome, though could have been sliced a little thicker. If you have never had Black Farfalle, I suggest getting it here. The server mentioned it would have a shelfish taste, but I didn't find it to be overwhelming, instead a nice balance. The Aged Sirloin came with perfectly prepared Gnocchi, which is a hard task seemingly for many chefs to pull off. But they did tonight! The Barolo Ragu was a perfect addition to bring the dish altogether.\n\nThe only thing I would say is the wine list was a tad overpriced in comparison to what I would expect from retail / dining out. So that is what made the 4th star come out. \n\nDefinitely a great dining experience."

It overlooks the Bellagio fountains which is pretty cool. \nThe service is extremely well-trained and professional. \nWe started off not ordering drinks but felt kind of funny, almost like it was *expected* we order a cocktail. If you're concerned about the cost, just don't go here. We sucked it up and ordered 2 drinks (cocktail was $18, wine was $15). \nWe started with the raw tuna appetizer with caviar, granny smith apples and truffle crema. It was delicious. It comes with 4 pieces and because we split it, they put 2 each on separate plates which was a nice touch. \nAlso, to note, the bread basket is insanely good. They bring a few different types and serve it with citrus olive oil, whipped mascarpone with sea salt and a tapenade. \nI had the duck and foie gras ravioli. I did enjoy them but they were a little one note. Perhaps they could have been a little heavier handed with the balsamic drizzle for a more complex flavor? I also was pretty full at that point after eating half the bread basket. I did wrap the rest to go and they tasted really great heated the next day. \nMy bf had the $55 steak which he really enjoyed but didn't understand why it was worth $55.\nWe finished the meal with the chocolate parfait since it was the only gluten free dessert option. It was fine. Pretty light and refreshing. \nOverall we enjoyed our experience once we got over the $$ aspect. It cost $200 for 2 people. Definitely check this place out if you are gluten free since they have many GF options. Just ask your waiter for the GF menu when you're seated. They are very accommodating."

Great service, ambiance and delicious food.\n\nI was originally a bit turned off by the poor service of the hostess taking our reservation over the phone, but once we arrived the staff (especially our waiter, Mike) was very friendly and accommodating. We loved the ambiance: dim lighting, candles on the tables and stylish decor. We requested a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains. It was really nice being able to look out from time to time even though there's a big bar on the window right at eye-level that makes it difficult to watch the fountain show without needing it lean over awkwardly.\n\nFood: Overall, we really enjoyed our meal! Though there were a couple items I'd recommend against, we loved most of the dishes we tried. Here's a quick review of each item we ordered:\n\nAPPETIZERS\n\n- Beet Salad: I enjoyed this, but it was my least favorite of the apps we ordered and could have used more beets.\n\n- Roasted Sea Scallops: If you like seafood, this dish is a must! SO GOOD. It was my favorite item we ordered, and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\n- Creamy Polenta: Another amazing dish! Creamy, buttery perfection.\n\nENTREES\n\n- Spaghetti: My boyfriend loved this! He said it was the best spaghetti he's had here in the states. The noodles and sauce reminded him of spaghetti in Venice, Italy. :-)\n\n- Mediterranean Branzino: I was disappointed in this dish. The fish was bland and the overall flavor was nothing special.\n\nDESSERTS\n\n- Amedei Chocolate Cake: Loved this!! The only thing that would have made it better is more gelato. It only comes with a tiny scoop and goes quickly with how chocolaty the cake is. Simple solution: request extra gelato while ordering.\n\n- Zeppole (with nutella center and vanilla sauce): We debated over getting this and splitting the two different desserts or just getting two chocolate cakes (which we knew we'd love). I'm so glad decided to give it a try as it ended up being our favorite!! I'd definitely recommend it to others dining here."

The wife and I only planned on going out only once for Restaurant Week, but after perusing all the menus we were persuaded to try one more place -- Scarpetta at the Cosmopolitan. We were seated at a two-top by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. One of the better views in town, it makes for a great spot for a romantic night out. The clean lines and modern motif of the restaurant interior add to the upscale and elegant atmosphere.\n\nScarpetta might have one of the best bread baskets around, but that can solely be attributed to the stromboli found within. Warm, chewy and delicious, it's almost a meal itself. The focaccia isn't bad either.\n\nThe first two dishes were yellowtail and polenta. The raw yellowtail consisted of four slices of fish topped with olio di zenzero, pickled red onions and microgreens. a couple slices were bland and under seasoned, while others were perfect. The other app ordered came on the recommendation of our waiter. And, I'm glad I listened to him. The creamy polenta came in a decent sized bowl along with a pot with truffled mushrooms fricassee, which the server promptly spooned into the polenta. The rich and savory dish was unlike any polenta I've had before. \n\nThe aged sirloin beef entree came sliced, cooked medium rare as ordered and was accompanied by a few light and fluffy potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, barolo ragu, and topped with paper thin slices of parmigiano. The sirloin was good, but not nearly as good as the other entree.\n\nThe short rib agnolotti didn't look like much when it was placed on the table -- a shallow bowl filled with a modest amount of small stuffed pasta. But, the flavor from each bite was amazing. Each piece was a thin, delicate piece of pasta stuffed with tender short rib, with an intensely rich sauce. I loved the added texture that the bread crumbs added. It was a great dish on every level.\n\nDesserts were tasty, as well. Amadei chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was dense and moist. The coconut panna cotta with coconut sorbetto, guava soup and pineapple was surprisingly light, creamy, and not too filling. It was a beautiful presentation with the guava soup covering and contrasting the panna cotta below.\n\nOur service was a perfect compliment to our meal. Luis timed everything perfectly and provided the kind of personalized, friendly service that every top-notch restaurant should have.\n\nI've had plenty of underwhelming experiences over the years for restaurant week, but this was definitely one of the best. I'm already thinking about when I'll be able to come back and hopefully enjoy more great food and service."

How can you screw up short ribs?\n\nThe OUT OF THIS WORLD: The panna cotta with guava soup and coconut ice cream. Very few desserts I eat are memorable. This one is VERY memorable. For a panna cotta, this dessert was extremely light and had just a hint of sweetness (I thought the guava was going to make it super sweet, but it didn't). I would come back and eat here just for this dessert. No joke!\n\nOur service was great. Request a table near one of the windows so you can see the fountain show at Bellagio."

However the yellowtail smelled and tasted funky and the tuna was ruined with truffle oil. The flavorless dishes kept rolling and the service was equally terrible. \n\nWe walked away feeling completely ripped off by a restaurant with an identity crisis. When i spend upwards of 300 on a meal, i expect good attentive service and good food. If a full plate goes back, i expect someone to notice and speak to us but no one cared at all. \n\nFor a guy like scott who is so critical on these cooking shows, you really should revisit your own house. There are just too many places in vegas for places like this to survive."

We had half a dozen oysters to start with, duck foie gras ravioli, and truffled pasta.  The first bite was very good but after that everything was very one-noted and boring.  Taste buds were not enthused by the end of dinner.  While the staff was VERY good the service can get slow.  We almost missed our 10:30pm show as we were at dinner for over 2 hours.

I think it needed a pinch of salt but this was our 2nd fave of the night.\nSpaghetti with tomato and basil ($24) - was not mind blowing but it's the best dish of the night and I can see why people are crazy about it.\nPici ($36) - tasted fine but the spaghetti tasted better.\nBlack cod ($33) - was good but not memorable.\nChocolate souffle ($15) - typical souffle but it was properly made which I appreciated. It was big, enough for the two of us.\n\nService was fantastic, we shared everything and our server had most of the dishes come already split. We never felt abandoned. Someone would always be around to make sure our glasses are full. Portion size is on the larger size which is great to see nowadays.

Maybe they just weren't in the working flow of things yet or maybe it just was an off night I don't know.\n\nThe door was wide open at 5:25 so we walked in and the hostess told us to make a reservation for 5:30 and to leave and come back in a few minutes . We thought that seemed odd but thought it was just because she was very young and figured that was all it was and came back a few minutes latter .\n\nToo start with I received a white lint filled napkin on top of my black pants , but I did notice they have black linen napkins they use for the wine bottles. \n\nWe felt uncomfortable the whole time dining because most of the time I saw up to eleven members of staff were standing across from us with their backs against the wall just looking out into our direction . I glared at them a few times but they didn't budge .\n\nWe started with the tuna susci -described as marinated vegetables with preserved truffles , everything was raw and everything had little taste.\n\nWe shared the short rib agnolotti , that were like mini raviolis filled with short rib that had a baby food texture inside the well made pasta. Maybe ten percent of the  agnolottis we topped with a scant amount of toasted  crumbs slightly laced with horseradish for flavor that were resting in some browned butter.\n\nThe black cod although cooked nicely would have been forgettable but was not , only because of the concentrated tomato that I found interesting .  this dish was extremely mild and under seasoned with a few pieces of fennel that were nicely caramelized .\n\nMy husband had the duck breast and he said it was his least favorite one he ever had since the skin wasn't crispy and also lacked flavor , he thought it wasn't seasoned at all .\n\nWe had a little time to kill before the show so we thought maybe dessert might be good . We ordered the zeppole I don't mean to be mean or disrespectful but honest to God they tasted just like the chocolate muffins of the Sweet Tomatoes salad bar buffet , the zeppole were bread like , not sweet , almost not chocolate flavored and only a few zeppole not all had essence of nutella in them . \n\nAt this price range they don't have this much room for error."

Their desserts are to die for. Their strawberry souffle is out of this world. It was light and fluffy as souffles should be but not too sweet. Melts in your mouth the second it touches your tongue. Light and slightly sweet...thinking about brings me joy. The vanilla ice cream adds to how amazing devouring this warm delicious souffle was. \n\nWe also had the coconut panacotta with guava...silky smooth and just so so good !!\nThe Amaedi Chocolate Cake is what every chocolate lover craves when they think of dessert. Warm melted chocolate in every bite with ice cream on the side *-* \n\nPlease prepare yourself and do not over eat during dinner. You do not want to skip dessert!!"

The bar is gorgeous and the bartender was very friendly. \nAfter we were seated and ordered drinks they brought us a really nice bread tray. I recommend the salami and cheese bread as the best of the bunch but everything in there was superb. The marscapone butter was a nice touch. \nI ordered the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms for an app. Super dish, and creamy really does describe it. I could make a meal out of it. \nFor my main course I had the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti which are like mini ravioli's. It was very rich and savory. The bread crumb crust on top was crispy and added some texture. Don't let the term bone marrow scare you it merely adds a depth of flavor. \nFor dessert my wife had the flourless chocolate cake with homemade gelato. There was nothing wrong with my coconut panna cotta, a custard like dessert but after tasting her cake i wish I has ordered that as well. \nAll in all a great meal at a reasonable price.

Thousands of people were descending on Cosmo's P3 restaurant zone all at once, and I had to select a dinner spot as quickly as possible, or else no open seats would be left.  Scarpetta was the ideal choice, since I could squeeze in at the bar.\n\nThe place was a madhouse, but I didn't mind.  Service at the bar was just as spot-on as in the dining room.  I was also luckily enough to be seated next to some very friendly and sociable solo diners who *love* talking about food.\n\nI started off with a glass of Riesling, which I sipped while nibbling on some freshly baked bread.  Scarpetta serves one of the finest breadbaskets in Vegas, with abundant olive oil, eggplant tapanade, and whipped mascarpone cheese for spreading.\n\nFor my app, I tried the braised beef short rib with farro risotto and a slice of lardo.  Ladies and gentlemen -- you will never taste short rib as tender and delicate as this.  Absolutely perfect.\n\nFor my entree, I tried the spaghetti, which is apparently a specialty of the house -- and I can totally see why.  Thick, plump noodles with a smooth and flavorful sauce will totally upend any preconceived notions of what spaghetti should taste like.  You think spaghetti is simple or boring?  Not after Scott Conant has his way with it.  \n\nThere are so many fabulous restaurants in the Cosmo that picking a single favorite is close to impossible...but Scarpetta is definitely high on the list!"

The server did stop once to go over the menu, but all he did was say \"these are the apps, these are the pastas, these are the main courses\" etc. etc. They must get a lot of people who never viewed a menu before. \n\nWe ordered the Misto fritto, Farmers salad, Fennel Black Cod, and wrapped Veal loin. (I did not take any pictures this time, I did not want my review to be a distraction of the occasion) \n\nFOOD\n\nMy wife loved the complimentary bread which included dippers of olive oil, roasted eggplant and tomatoes, and truffle butter. The bread was varieties of an Italian Sourdough, foccacia, stromboli, and a vegetable stromboli. \n\nThey automatically split our app & salad which I appreciated. \n\nMISTO FRITTO\n\nThe menu description was very vague, but I figured it had to be a spin off of fried calamari. Tempura battered squid, white anchovies, cauliflower, and the stems of chives. There were no anchovies in my plate, and happened to be my wife's first bite on her's which she did not like at all. I would not have known about the anchovies (which I love) if I did not finish her plate. The fry was perfect, and I really liked the seasoning which included rosemary. \n\nFARMERS SALAD\n\nThe presentation was beautiful. Some of the vegetables (green & yellow squash) were almost shaved. It was a nice salad, but not much flavor. There were only 2 choices of salad on the menu and I chose this one. My wife ate only half of hers. \n\nVEAL LOIN\n\nThere is a picture of this dish in the archives. 3 (2oz?) wrapped pieces of veal perfectly cooked. A few pieces of carrots and another vegetable. I tasted some sort of mustard on this dish with another sauce. The menu (again) was VERY vague. As I ate, I was wondering what the expense was in making this dish that carried a $38 price. \n\n\nBLACK COD\n\nPresentation was standard, Looked to be about a 5oz filet. My wife was half way through her dish without a sound. Knowing my wife, this means she did not want to disappoint me in saying she did not care for it. I tried a bite and thought it was weird for Cod to be so mushy. It was not pleasant at all. Maybe even undercooked. \nMy wife at all the vegetables and there was half of the filet sitting alone on the plate when the busser took it away. Sad that no one noticed that half of what was supposed to be the hero of this dish was being tossed out like a used tissue. \n\nWe passed on dessert because to me, dessert should be the perfect finish to a perfect meal which this whole experience was not. My wife liked the complimentary bread the best and I liked the Fritto Misto the best. There was some woman in a very loud group making noises that reminded me of farm animals in heat. \n\nIt shouldn't be this way in a restaurant of this price point.   \n\nI asked for the check (1app, 1 salad, 2 entrees) $116.00 \n\nAs we were getting up to leave, a person came by with a dish that said happy birthday and had 2 biscotti\"s , a cookie, a salted chocolate thingy and a lit candle.\n\nWould have went better with a cappuccino but the check was already paid. \n\nThis was a disappointing experience, even more so because I wanted it to be special for my wife's 40th. She liked the complimentary bread.....\n\nIf I can say something positive and relative, I would recommend going to D.O.C G. instead. Same Chef, different menu. Been there 5 times and loved it."

Maybe it picked up after I left?\n\nThe bread was excellent and I usually don't like bread at Italian restaurants.  They had a focaccia, ciabiata, standard loaf, and crazy one with meat in it.  As a vegetarian I had the first 3.  In addition there were 3 dips - an amazing butter, a eggplant option, and citrus infused EVOO.\n\nI began with the white artichoke soup.  Great presentation.  Mushrooms and croutons with a nice foam and greens, then came the creamy artichoke soup.  Cleaned the bowl.\n\nThen the famed spaghetti.  The $24 spaghetti that apparently is amazing.  I had to find out for myself.  I hadn't ordered spaghetti from an Italian restaurant in a decade (in high school I'd order it on dates to save money).  It was honestly - ok.  I found mine to be too al dente, but perhaps this is personal taste and preference.  Still good pasta - but don't feel like you have to get the spaghetti.\n\nThe service was great.  The waiter was quick, knowledgable, and professional.  The manager came over and chatted with me for 15 minutes which was great.\n\nThey sat me at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains - can't complain about that.\n\nGo here.  So you can say you ate at Scott's place and because it's delicious."

The scallop was pretty good, the foie gras ravioli was ok, we had a steak dish that I can't remember because it was that forgetful. finished it off with gelato, which I could have cared less about. The service was great, the decor was nice but boring. In general I was extremely underwhelmed. If my bill would have been about 50 dollars cheaper I would say this is a good place to take a friend or business partner, but not a date or someone who you'd want to share a meaningful or memorable evening with. However, since Scarpetta was not 50 dollars cheaper, my conclusion is... go somewhere else. There are much better places."

We also had the roasted chicken which was good, but had that same sauce that made it taste funny. We ordered the spaghetti just to try it, and it was very plain, no meatballs, and the noodles were a little harder than what they shouldve been. for dessert, we had the coconut panna cotta that had caramelized pineapples and a guava soup with ice cream which was so good!"

I'm a bit of a pain and he was patient and helpful and very professional. He had great advice, and was very understanding of my gluten allergy (and I was thrilled that they had a separate gluten free menu). Every dish ordered was an 'oh wow you gotta taste this\" moment. My friends said the stromboli bread basket with the choice of marscapone butter, lemon olive oil and eggplant caponata kicked off the night. Other standouts included the short rib agnolotti, polenta with mushroom ragout and the chocolate cake with almond gelato and salted caramel. Even the music was great. I had been hating being in Vegas- the riff-raff, over-designed spaces,  overpriced fussy but mediocre food, but this restaurant redeemed the trip. Note to the management- if you already have a gluten free menu why not put it on the website with the other menus?? I wish we had known about this place earlier."

We had the following:\n\nCorn soup with King crab fritters $19\n\nShort Rib Agnolotti $26\n\nAlaskan Halibut $40\n\nCoconut Souffle $15\n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant, we waited about 20 minutes on a Thursday with reservation. We could see it was extremely busy which made me really excited to try Scott Conant's food. When we were seated, we were surprised to see what an awesome view of the Strip the resto had. As far as the food, it was pretty good. My wife said she loved the corn soup as it was not too sweet and they actually left some kernels in the soup to give it a texture contrast. The agnolotti was good. It was quite a rick tasting dish so maybe next time I'll ask for a lemon to squeeze on it or something. The halibut was a good dish after the pasta as it tasted very healthy with the vegetable broth surrounding the fish. The coconut souffle was awesome! It goes on my top 5 dessert list in vegas for sure. The service was great. We were seen by our waiter numerous times and our water was always filled. The only thing I would say negative was that the pasta was a little saturated in butter too much for my liking. Overall, I would scarpetta is a good romantic resto if you're looking for upscale italian food."

            "review": "I had HIGH expectations coming to this place. EXTREMELY high expectations. For all the attention to detail and harsh criticisms that Scott has on Chopped, I anticipated a true culinary masterpiece. \n\nMy girlfriend and I weren't that hungry, because we had already had an early dinner, but decided to give this place a shot because it was the only day that would have worked with our trip to Las Vegas. We thought the best thing to do would be to just order an appetizer and only one course each, as opposed to the traditional multiple courses with a true Italian meal. We ordered the short ribs as an appetizer, I ordered the spaghetti and my girlfriend ordered the roasted chicken.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the bread. You heard me. The BEST part of the meal was the bread. I must say, I had high hopes going in, higher hopes after the bread, because that was good bread. The focaccia was tasty, with the right amount of rosemary and well developed. It tasted fresh and airy. The other breads were also very good. \n\nWe got our appetizer, and it was very small - which is usual for a good Italian place, since it's expected that you order multiple courses. This wasn't an appetizer though, it was basically an amuse-bouche. The ribs had good flavor, and the risotto was good as well, it good texture, but I would have liked it to be cooked a little longer - it wasn't crunchy, but it was still slightly underdone. \n\nOut come our main courses. \n\nMy pasta is placed on the table, and the server removes the cloche. My first impression? \"This is a main course?\" I counted how many bites it took me to finish that pasta, and it was nine. Literally nine. It was such a small meal that I was still slightly hungry afterwards - even though I wasn't all that hungry coming in. And as for the flavor? I think Barilla pasta and Prego sauce tastes about the same, as long as you add some fresh basil, which was the only saving grace. But for $24, this was ludicrous. The pasta was just about al dente as well, so there was good texture. And as for the chicken? Horrible. Absolutely horrible. And small. I asked the server about the preparation, and he noted that it is brined with anise and some other flavors, which were conspicuously missing from the flavor of the dish. I ended up spending around $80 on just these three items, and definitely was left wondering why. Scarpetta gets the award for most over-promised, under-delivered food experience I've had so far. It was so bad that any time I see Scott on Chopped or any other show, I feel like he has no idea what he is talking about. Avoid this place, and go to Secret Pizza just down the hall instead - you'll save money, eat tastier food, and leave with a better experience."

            "review": "Damn this was such a good meal!  My friends and I dined here for Restaurant Week 2013 and all of us, but one, ordered off the Restaurant week menu.  It all began when I made reservations on Open Table, courtesy of the Yelp App on my iPhone.  I didnt have any preference of where we sat, but where the hostess sat us was remarkable!  We got a window seat facing the Bellagio, so not only did we enjoy a delicious meal, we also got to enjoy a fantastic view of the strip, the Bellagio, and also the Bellagio Fountain show all at once!  Now this was a meal to remember!  Service was top notch, there were no disappointments there; the waiter we had was very attentive and helpful in helping us make our selection from the menu.  \n\nCourse 1: Braised beef short rib - very tender pieces of sliced beef on top of what they called a risotto (not the traditional type of risotto) but it was still delicious!  The \"Risotto\" was basically diced pieces of vegetables which supported the 3-4 pieces of beef on top.  Very good combination of flavors and textures.  Very impressed.  \n\nBefore the second course came, we were all scarfing down their stromboli bread which is complimentary with our meal!  It came with other bread, which were not that memorable.  The bread was also served with three types of spreads, an eggplant marinara spread, olive oil, and something else I cannot remember. On a side note, one of my friends even asked the waiter to bring an entire basket filled with the bread, which he did!  That made her evening! haha.  \n\nCourse 2: Jidori Chicken - Now I didn't know what a Jidori chicken was, so I asked the waiter.  This whole time, I thought it was the way the chicken was cooked!  But instead, it is the type of chicken used to make the chicken, like using kurabuta pork.  I can definitely tell the difference with kurabuta pork and regular pork, but this jidori chicken was a bit more difficult to tell the difference from regular chicken, besides the fact that this chicken was MOIST throughout!  Maybe that's what makes Jidori chicken so good?  Well, next time I will know! =D  \n\nNot only did I have the second course as my main meal, I HAD to try their handmade spaghetti everyone RAVES about!  So I ordered a dish for everyone to share!  In conclusion, it was pretty damn good.  What makes it good is the noodles!  The texture is not too over or undercooked, but just right!  I guess the handmade pasta really makes a difference in a pasta dish!  \n\nCourse 3: Chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream - Now how can you end a meal without dessert!?  My stomach was SO distended PRIOR to the second course, but I had to taste everything!  By the time dessert came, I swear I have a second stomach!  I devoured not ONLY MY dessert, but my friends dessert too!  She ordered the stuffed donuts with nutella....what?! NUTELLA in fried dough?  Yes!  Nuff said. ;-)  \n\nI'd definitely come back to Scarpetta again!  Quite pricey for a student like myself, so probably come again with my family, during restaurant week, or when I start making the big bucks!"

Don't really know what that green sauce was but it was a little weird for my taste. My boyfriend and I just had an AYCE meal before this, so we decided to split the scallops and the spaghetti. Our server had both plated separately so that's always a pleasant surprise! Eating the scallops was the first time I had ever eaten brussels sprouts and I'm not sure if that was a good idea, 'cause given their bad rep, what if I get them somewhere else expecting them to taste like these ones and they just don't match up?! I'll just have to deal I guess. But yeah the scallops were delicious, and the spaghetti was confusing. How does something so simple taste so good??

Not sure if that's his real life persona or his made for TV Simon Cowell-like persona that makes for good ratings. I broke down and went to Scarpetta, totally prepared to hate the place. As much as I wanted to hate it, I loved it. It's always interesting to read the reviews and see the swings, with one reviewer hating it and the next loving it. It's usually the total experience that somehow helps make the food more or less memorable. It was totally memorable for me, from being with my wife to the Bellagio fountains to attentive service to the food being timely served, perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. The bread basket was all artisan selections, a meal in itself. The creamy polenta and truffled mushrooms were heavenly. The spaghetti was as good as spaghetti gets....there's only so much you can do with it and I thought the sauce was outstanding. The black cod melted in your mouth and was a work of art.

(No joke...I went to the restroom by the entrance and some girl had tossed her cookies alllll over the floor.) I mention this because I felt like the Cosmopolitan was starting to lose its appeal for me. It's definitely a different crowd from what it opened to a couple of years ago.  But Scarpetta has really turned it around for me.\n\nI'd been wanting to go to Scarpetta in LA for awhile so I was SUPER excited when we came upon this location after finding a long wait at Jaleo. Since it was a Saturday night, we decided to push our luck and ended up with a booth tucked away in the lounge/bar. Perfect. \n\nThe service was amazing from the get-go. Started off with the delicious Gallardo with Hendricks for me, and a proper margarita for my man. We were starving so we inhaled our bread basket of rosemary foccacia and stromboli with marscapone butter and eggplant cabonata. That right there? Best bread basket EVER. Moved on to the most amazing, melts in your mouth short ribs over a bed of farro and veggies. Originally, the farro was for me and the short ribs for my bf but I had to take a bite when I saw his eyes roll over. Then onto our entrees of spaghetti and Colorado lamb. I have to admit, that spaghetti was super overhyped for me. I really liked it, but I expected too much for a simple plate of well executed pasta with tomato sauce. Don't get me wrong...it was delicious, but I'd choose differently next time. The lamb was, however, declared the best lamb he'd ever had.\n\nWe were stuffed by then but we couldn't resist dessert. I chose the browned butter cake with figs and poached pears because I just wanted the pears, heh. Our awesome server brought me a taste of aperol to pair with it - what a perfect way to end our meal.\n\nWhen we were discussing our fave meals from the weekend, we both agreed this was by far the best. In fact, I'll go as far as saying it was one of my best meals in Vegas ever. Thanks for an amazing time, Scarpetta."

            "review": "As soon as I had my flight and hotel booked for Vegas I also made my dinner reservation at Scarpetta. Even though we had made our reservation made for 8 on a Saturday night we still waited about 15 minutes or so for our table. Upon getting seated in the dining room I was incredibly impressed. The room was dimly lit, beautifully decorated and facing the fountains of the Bellagio. \n\nOur waiter quickly approached with our wine and cocktail lists and allowed us to look over them for a while. When he approached again we were still indecisive. We told him what we were thinking about ordering and he made a great suggestion. Now that drinks were ordered, it was time to dig into the bread basket. We loved the stromboli as well as the sourdough and focaccia bread. The eggplant caponata was also delicious. If I wasn't to embarrassed to order another bread basket I would have done so.\n\nAfter we had ordered we were anxious to receive our food. We started with the shortribs over farro pasta. The shortribs fell apart and were incredibly rich. The farro was the perfect companion to this well made dish. Our polenta was next. It was creamy and topped with mushrooms. Wow. We finished with the home made tagilatelle with vegetables and fava beans as well as guanciale. Being the pasta snob Scott Conant is on \"Chopped\" I knew this had to be good. I was right. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was light and flavorful. Seeing as we weren't completely full we ordered dessert.\n\nAnd what a dessert it was. The bombolini were basically dougnut holes filled with nutella and a vanilla custard. They were accompanied by a nutella powder and bruleed bananas. It was the perfect combination of textures: The soft doughnuts, the creamy nutella and vanilla custard, the crunchy bruleed bananas and the light nutella powder were out of control good.\n\nScarpetta is a must for Italian food lovers in Vegas. It's the perfect place for a date night."

It was the perfect combination of feminine & masculine which happens to be my favorite combo for any space! Lots of wood, very warm color palette yet there were sexy curves everywhere like the furniture, lighting & seating arrangements. Everything about the space was very beautiful. It felt like a man & woman got together to create it. \n\nThe view of the Bellagio Fountains is always stunning as it never gets old for me and the service was on point. Thank you to our waiter for the complimentary champagne & dessert which was banana souffl\u00e9 (AMAZING)!\n\nNow for the carb overload ~ the classic spaghetti is popular as it should be because it was perfect. Fresh noodles, sweet sauce with a hint of basil & garlic. The famous polenta! WOW! Creamy heaven! The duck & foie gras ravioli was beyond decadent and then the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti (climax) I wanted to lick my plate! I was so full but I savored every single little bite as it's possibly one of the top dishes EVER! I still think about it...\n\nHad a few cocktails as well & just sat back & enjoyed ourselves while watching the fountains. It was a beautiful evening & I cannot wait to go back! It's very rare to enjoy everything but I really did."

We started out with cocktails & enjoyed the variety of complimentary bread served with citrus olive oil, eggplant caponata & mascarpone butter. We chose the lardo wrapped prawns as our appetizer which were served with rosemary lentils & it was very flavorful. I had the black tagliolini pasta for my entree which was lightly dressed with a cream sauce & topped with dungeness crab, uni & tobiko. I told the server's assistant who removed my empty dish that, had I been alone, I would have licked the plate...it was that good. I lived in Italy for several months & had some great pasta, but never anything that spectacular. My date had the lamb trio which was filet, sausage & chop over ceci beans & baby carrots topped with hazelnut. He requested the chop cooked medium rare but it was served rare. The server quickly took it back for a re-fire & it was perfectly cooked upon its return. We enjoyed the nutella & vanilla bomboloni for dessert which was served with chocolate shortbread crumble & banana gelato. The only issue I had was that our server was a little aloof & cold, but it was late & I believe we were his last table so I understand. It really did nothing to detract from my fantastic experience at Scarpetta & his assistant, guy with a beard & long hair (cute!), made up for it with his kind conversation. Can't wait to return for another meal here!"

After eating at a lot of great places on the strip, I had high expectations. My friend got the food right but our overall experience was greatly lacking.\n\nAfter explaining to our server that we had no other places to be, I expected a slow, thoughtful dinner where we could savor each course. Rather it felt like the staff was trying to flip the table. Everyone in our party of four felt like the food was being served without passion. A full course meal for four was served and eaten in about an hour. I was hoping for at least a relaxing two-hour dinner. \n\nThe food itself was quite good--not the best we've had on our trip to Vegas--but delightful. The price we paid seemed a bit on the high side for the quality of food but for the most part seemed appropriate. The foie gras ravioli is a must do.\n\nOur server was polite but inattentive. One drink we ordered (mine) failed to make it to the table--an honest enough mistake as these oversights can happen now and then. However the server failed to notice and not once throughout the entire meal checked on drinks. I completed my meal without ever getting a beverage. When I was charged for the drink and the error was called out, the server made no effort to make it right.\n\nThe support staff was overly attentive. Empty plates were cleared promptly. However my unfinished main dish was almost taken twice before I was finished. I had to stop the food from being cleared before I was done enjoying it. Again, it seemed like they were trying to flip the table. One of the support staff also topped my unfinished sparkling water with tap.\n\nPlate prices are on the high side and the many missteps were inconsistent with the quality I expected. There are myriad great places to eat in Vegas and service is a key differentiator. You can find better, more unique food to enliven your palate and, based on our time there, more invested humans to help you experience it."

I made 5:30 reservations on Opentable.\n\nWe were the first diners of the evening, we were seated at a table for two overlooking the Bellagio fountains. However, when the fountain show actually began the we realized the view was quite obstructed from the tall trees surrounding the lake. It was no bother, we didn't come for the view, we were there for the food. \n \nWe started with a delicious bread basket, it had a variety of Italian breads and the real treat was stromboli with prosciutto and smoked mozzarella. Citrus olive oil, butter with marscapone and eggplant & tomatoes accompanied the bread. I could've easily made a meal from this, but I ordered the creamy polenta to whet our appetite.\n\nI've heard nothing but praises for this polenta. It was a beautiful dish. Luscious and full of truffle flavor, but it didn't leave me wanting more. \n\nNext, we opted to skip the entrees and order selections from the secondini portion of the meal. Frank went with the Signature spaghetti. It's been featured on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" so it's hard to pass it up. I went with the duck and foie gras ravioli. It was the dish that made me lust over the restaurant for the past year. \n\nThe ravioli did not disappoint. It was the second best ravioli I've had to date. Mama Egi's ravioli over at Circo takes the cake. But this was very, very good. Well balanced and the raviolis seemed to melt on your tongue. The spaghetti was good, but hardly a best thing I ever ate. I enjoyed the simplicity of it, the al dente noodle, but $26 spaghetti should knock my socks off, it did not. \n\nWe weren't overly stuffed so we took a gander at the dessert menu and quickly chose zeppole for dessert.\n\nNow, this was special! I'm not fond of dessert oozing with sweetness. This bordered on savory and I love it. These little pillowy bites were filled with nutella and topped with candied hazelnuts. There was a creme anglaise for dipping. It was a perfect end to the meal. \n\nService was very good throughout. Our server, Luis, was helpful and he made certain we did not go thirsty. Fresh iced teas were plentiful. The meal set us back $92. Pretty good considering one could easily spend an arm and leg here."

The portion sizes are very small and the prices are ridiculous.\n\nI started my meal off with the roasted diver scallops. These are served with sunchokes, pinenuts, gremolata and mushrooms. Awesome appetizer...fresh and delicious.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered perigord black truffle tagliatelle. This truffle was definitely amazing, I was just disappointed in the quantity. They put literally three small shavings in my dish of plain pasta (no vegetables...nothing) and this cost $65. I understand that 1 oz of these truffles is $60-100, but at the same time they could have at least put 5 or 6 shavings. I thought this was a total rip-off. I mean this is black truffle, NOT even white truffle! I have been to other high-end restaurants where I pay the same price and they will literally shave a whole truffle into my pasta. Next time, I will boil my own plain pasta at home and order these truffles online. The cost will be the same but at least I will be getting what I pay for...VALUE!!\n\nFor dessert, I ended my meal with the amedei chocolate cake served with gelato and salted caramel sauce. Rich and luscious dessert to finish off the night.        \n                      \nI recommend checking out Scarpetta for dinner, just avoid ordering the black and white truffles and be sure to bring a full wallet!"

I tried to make reservations for 10 online through their website, but I was told that there were no reservations available within 2.5 hours of our reservation time (830pm on a Sunday) for 8 weeks. I called instead, and they were able to accommodate us. \n\nWhen we got there, we had to wait for a little while for them to get our table together, but the cocktail menu was beautiful. I indulged in the Gallardo, Hendrick's apple, lime, and basil. It was fresh and clean, really light and flavorful. It also came with a basil leaf floating in it, and was gorgeous. \n\nWhen they seated us, they'd given us a private dining room for our large group, and we had an amazing server who was knowledgeable, friendly, and willing to make suggestions. \n\nThe meal started with fresh baked rosemary bread served with a trip of condiments. There was soft, whipped marscapone butter, a rich eggplant tapenade, and simple quality olive oil. I order the spring pea soup with dungeness crab, almonds, and pea tendrils as a starter. It was so delicate, fresh, and really lovely. It tasted like spring. The crunch and nutty flavor from the almonds and the sweet meaty taste of the shredded crab was such a nice balance of the pea flavor. It was spring green, and melted in my mouth. I'm not even a huge fan of peas, but this is such a good example of how fresh, high-quality ingredients can elevate something simple to culinary art. \n\nFor dinner, I had the Pici with lobster that the server suggested. This is the best pasta I've ever eaten. And I've eaten a lot of pasta. It's house made and fresh, and this is how al dente is supposed to be. It's firm and chewy, but still delicate and flavorful. It was made with tarragon, so it was green and herby. The pesto was made of almonds and chili, so it had a little spice to it. I could've handled more spice, though. There was almost no heat, but it's OK because the other flavors were so perfect. This is also the best cooked lobster I've ever had. I'm used to lobster in butter, or pieces so small thrown into dishes to give them an upscale feel, but these were beautiful, pink large pieces of lobster. They still benefited from the fat in the olive oil pesto, and it brought out lobster flavors I hadn't tasted before. They were tender and meaty, and balanced well with the pasta and pesto. It was simply one of the best pasta meals I've ever had in my life.\n\nOne of the house specialties is spaghetti with tomato and basil. Sounds easy, right? Once again, one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had in my life. The ingredients and technique are so high-quality that they elevate even the simplest meals into a once-in-a-lifetime experience. \n\nThe filet was tender and flavorful, although my companion felt is was little more medium-well than the medium he ordered. The potato puree it rested on absorbed the steak juices and every bite tasted luxurious. \n\nThe honey glazed carrots with toasted pistachios were roasted to perfection. They were soft, but not limp or mushy, and the pistachios added a pleasant nutty crunch. They were sweet, but not cloying, and well balanced. Again, I'm not a huge carrot fan, but these made me a believer. \n\nMy one 21st-century complaint is the lights are so low, I wasn't able to get great pictures, but really, that's probably a plus. It was intimate and romantic. \n\nIndulge at Scarpetta and you won't regret it. Take your time and savor the flavors at this masterful restaurant. There's a lot of work and knowledge going into these meals, and if you're privileged enough to eat here, relish every bite."

The adult beverages were VERY good, and wait staff was excellent and well-informed about the menu.  One of our party was newly enamored of a drink she had previously had at the Chandelier bar at this same hotel--they did not have this drink at Scarpetta--but our waiter discussed it with the bartender and they came up with an excellent version of the cocktail--which may have surpassed the original!\n\nI agree with the prior comments about the bread basket--the bread with the salami was the best thing we ate all night.\n\nWe ordered many things off of the menu--from the basic spaghetti to the seafood pasta--all of it was served very quickly and at proper temperature, etc, and presentation was great.   The pasta portion of the seafood pasta was overdone, but the rest of the meals were very good (though nothing I would say we had to go back for, except that bread!).\n\nDesert was basic and boring--nothing exciting.\n\nOverall the ambience was great--excellent place for date night, drinks, and decent food."

The short rib agnolotti was absolutely fantastic.  The duck and foie gras ravioli (which is what I had before) was ok, but there's not much foie flavor and this time the sauce had a spicy kick to it that I did not care for.  Though the waiter warned us that the pasta portions were light (in between appetizer and entree size, he said), I actually found them quite filling.

The squash soup is some of the best I've ever had. The tuna was good but I wouldn't get it again. The braised short ribs were perfect and while I have no idea what was in that sauce, it was heavenly. Probably will get the braised short ribs the next few times I go.\n\nAs for entrees, they are famous for their duck and foie gras ravioli and believe me, it lives up to the loftiest of expectations. It's such a unique dish and the duck and foie gras compliment each other perfectly. It doesn't feel too heavy, goes down sooooo smoothly and has this great sauce on top with just the perfect amount of cheese. Ive had it multiple times and plan on getting it again in the future. \nI've also had the short rib agnolottie which is almost as superb. The short rib is great and you get this really tasty hint of horseradish in the sauce. It's far from overwhelming, just a hint of it, but after a full plate of the agnolotti, you can certainly tell its there. But it doesn't take away from the dish, the short rib and pasta are both great.\nWhile I've not tried the black cod or the steak, my companions have and they have reported being very happy with their choices.\n\nOddly enough, I've not had dessert at Scarpetta. Maybe in the future I will, I'm sure it will be tasty.\n\nA few other things to note: the view is superb, definitely ask for a window seat and you'll get a side view of the bellagio fountains. It's just a matter of luck and if they have a table available, ask when you make the reservation. The portions are great. So often Vegas portions (especially at nice restaurants) are so small, but these are adequate and leaves you filling full but not overly full (as often dishes are so heavy with fat and cream and such). The price is very appropriate. Nothing is exorbitantly pricy, nothing is cheap, the price is correct."

We also shared a side of mixed mushrooms, but could hardly make a dent in them although they were delicious! In true Vegas style, the portions are quite generous.

I don't remember the exact amounts. \n \nIf you drink wine, add the wine for each sampler. You will be very happy with their wine selection for EACH of the sampler. \n\nTheir signature spaghetti is the best I have ever had.

Lobster and spaghetti in a sauce with a spicy finish.  The ladies had the short rib agnolotti which was also very delicious.  We decided that the Pici was the best of the two just because of the wonderful spiciness. All of the pastas were cooked perfectly.

            "review": "I thought Scarpetta was supposed to be a step up from DOCG, but unfortunately found it to be the opposite. Have had several great experiences at DOCG, but rather than topping it, Scarpetta didn't even compare.\n\nSTARTERS\nBREAD BASKET: Five types of bread (the olive-studded one and the rolled spinach and cheese were favorites) and three dipping sauces (really liked the tomato tapenade, lemon olive oil was aromatic).\nRAW YELLOWTAIL ($18): Four thin slices of yellowtail sashimi, accented with ginger oil and red onion, and what seemed to be sea salt? Liked it but not worth the price.\nENGLISH PEA SOUP ($19): Much better than the version at Giada's. I liked the mint accents and flavorful rock shrimp, though there could have been more of it. Note that this is a hot soup, not chilled.\nMEDITERRANEAN OCTOPUS: Not the best version I've had but good, I liked that it was a pretty plate formed using one whole octopus tentacle rather than pieces as elsewhere. This is plated with ceci beans and what seemed to be hummus. \n\nPASTAS\nSPAGHETTI: BF's pick, and his favorite for the night. Classic but well-made spaghetti with tomato and basil. I agree with another reviewer who said this dish tasted like the pasta version of a margherita pizza.\nORECCHIETTI: \"Little ears\" pasta with broccoli rabe and a house-made sausage. Neither of us really cared for this and wished we had opted to split one of the fish entrees instead. Note that this was on the night's menu in place of the gnocchetti sardi on the online menu.\nAGNOLOTTI: Short rib, brown butter, and horseradish bread crumbs. Ordered this dish because it was one most recommended in reviews. It was rich and I enjoyed the actual pasta, but the combination of flavors didn't especially work for me. \n\nDESSERTS\nCAPPUCCINO: Very well made, no bitterness or acidity or burned taste at all, just pure, strong coffee, and a ton of foam. \nSTRAWBERRY SOUFFLE: Another dish that was significantly better than one I had at Giada's (hers was lemon flavored). This was like eating a cloud, it was so perfectly executed. The strawberry gelato was among the most flavorful versions I've had, and the fresh strawberry accents were so ripe that this dish didn't need the accompanying creme fraiche. \nAMEDEI CHOCOLATE CAKE: For the chocolate-lover. This was extremely rich and dense, more like a brownie than a cake. The almond gelato had almonds on top for texture, which we liked, but the flavor of the salted caramel sauce was minimal and the cake itself was a bit overcooked and hard.\n\nThe appetizers were okay, the pastas were okay, and the desserts were okay. As I left, I wished I'd just gone next door to get the incredible salted caramel bundino at DOCG, which blows both of the desserts we had here out of the water.\n\nService was attentive, and I appreciate that we were able to get a seat in the second row from the windows even with a last-minute reservation. Location is dark and romantic, making photos nearly impossible (and largely inappropriate). Overall quality of food was less than expected. I'll be returning to DOCG instead, even though it is more casual... they have a better wine list, too."

            "review": "AMAZING PASTA.  My mom says it's not as good as Italy but it is pretty dang close, and that's good enough for me.\n\nPARKING: It's located in the Cosmo, third floor I believe at the corner near the restrooms, it's kind of small random entrance.  Free parking at all LV hotels and a quick walk from any of the hotels on the strip.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Dark, with a great view of the Bellagio water fountains.  Ask for a window seat if you're with a group of 2, if you have a bigger group you can still get pretty close but not right up to the window.  There were actually a lot of big groups that we saw and they have several private rooms for big parties like birthdays or celebrations, which I thought was cool.\n\nFOOD: Had to get the spaghetti with tomato and basil.  It doesn't look like a lot in the pictures but when you  unravel the pasta, it's plenty for one person especially if you're going to be getting any appetizers or dessert.\n\nBREAD BASKET - They give you all kinds of bread, sourdough, focaccia, stromboli (i think thats what its called with salami and cheese) and for those allergic to dairy, the foccacia is dairy free!!\n\nCREAMY POLENTA - Sooo good, and I don't even like polenta!! It's creamy like mashed potatoes and so flavorful (prob a lot of butter) with the mushrooms it was perfect.\n\nTUNA 'SUSCI' - Also VERY good, and very fresh! A tun roll but the tuna was wrapped around the outside, I dont remember what was inside but it was tasty.  \n\nSPAGHETTI - So amazing.  They hand make it everyday and you can tell.  It was al dente and CHEWY, fresh!! And the sauce was delicious, light but flavorful and something that seemed so simple but blew me away.  Also for those allergic to dairy they can make it without butter and milk and my sister said it tasted just as good.  I tried a piece and it was good, but definitely not as flavorful as mine.  \n\nAMEDEI CHOCOLATE CAKE - Your basic rich, chocolate cake with a slight runny inside.  It was a great way to end the night but by the end of it I was  completely stuffed.\n\nOverall, a great place to try if you're looking for a fancy place in Vegas.  The pasta is like $26 and the atmosphere, although not the best I've ever had, is good and romantic for a date or a fancy dinner with the family.  Just make sure you get a good window seat!"

We had a 9:30pm reservation and was seated on time. The place was about 50% full. The service at the start was incredible but tapered off towards the end of the evening when they swapped out waiters on us. Wait staff however all very knowledgeable about the wine and the food. I started with Octopus which was delicious followed by the lobster pici. The pici was very nice indeed, tasty and pretty rich. The pasta itself was very dense and cooked al dente which took a little more effort to eat than perhaps it should have. It was a good size portion. I had a cheesecake for desert but at that point was too full to really appreciate it's intricate flavors. My wife started with the lobster salad which was also excellent followed by the Branzino, again delicious. Modern d\u00e9cor with a chilled yet sophisticated ambience. I wore a jacket but pretty sure you could dine here in a t-shirt if you wanted to. We dropped just over $300 for the evening including a modestly priced bottle of white wine. If this wasn't Vegas I would say it was not worth that kind of outlay. Seemed a little overpriced. But who knows."

The taste was wonderful but the pasta wasn't cooked right (Ironic I know since he dings people on this very issue). \n\nWe told the server our pasta was a lil too al dente and he quickly corrected me that fresh pasta can't be al dente. I continued to clarify that its a big tough in the center and doesn't taste like its cooked all the way through. I completely understand that pasta should still have a touch bite to it but this was practically raw on the inside. Like I said before I REALLY wanted to love this dish and the server made me feel really stupid for not \"getting\" how pasta should be cooked. The restaurant took the spaghetti off our bill which was really nice but I wish they'd offer us a redo of the dish. \n\nRegardless, I haven't given up hope just yet.

The dining room doesn't feel crowded, and while it's quiet enough that you'll sometimes hear other conversations, the noise isn't intrusive.\n\nIn addition to wine, I ordered a Pisco Flower off of their cocktail menu. It was well made, but nothing to write home about.\n\nThe complimentary bread was outstanding, as were the accompaniments. They brought us olive oil, an olive tapenade, and a creamy mascarpone spread.\n\nWe ordered the brussell sprouts, broccoli rabe, and burata as appetizers. The burata was good, as were the pickled beets that came with it. The brussell sprouts cam with apple slices and a cream sauce. It was fine, but would have benefited from more caramelization on the sprouts. The broccoli rabe was just disappointing. Indistinguishable from the version you might get  at a diner or buffet on the side of the highway.\n\nI ordered the fettuccine as my entree. It was delicious, one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. Someone pointed out that it tasted like pizza. This brought it down a bit after seeing that it was true. It tasted like a sausage and roasted pepper pizza, but this wasn't a bad thing. My friend had the famed duck foie gras ravioli, and it fell short. The foie gras filling was rich, but airy and light. It felt incomplete without a heavier component to pair with it. Perhaps my bite missed one of the small dabs of sauce that was strewn about. I didn't try the agnolotti or the spaghetti that were also ordered, but they looked very good.\n\nOur server brought our friend a nice little dessert sampler for his birthday at the end. Service was great throughout, but it felt a bit odd when they began clearing plates before everyone was finished eating.\n\nOverall, had a great time here and would come back."

Even though we came earlier than our actual reservations, the hostess was still able to seat us immediately and we also got to sit close to the window to see the Bellagio water show.  Our server was friendly and very helpful.  We ladies weren't sure what wines to drink with our dinner so our server was nice enough to let us try a few of their wines so we can decide on our choice.  \n\nMy DH had the beet salad and the duck ravioli.  He was in heaven.  Every time he put a ravioli in his mouth, he was saying, \"Oh my god, Oh my god this is so good.\"\n\nWe also had the creamy polenta for appetizer, that was also a big hit.  I had the spaghetti.  It sounds plain, but was the best I've ever eaten.  Seriously.   I wanted to hate this restaurant so much because Scott Connant is such a stickler for his pasta on \"Chopped\".  I was ready to pounce out a bad review because the pasta was not right, or the seasoning was off.  But I have to say I had nothing to complain about, it was utterly a fantastic experience and the pasta was awesome! Even the stromboli bread that they brought out left me speechless.  Ok, so not speechless where I couldn't ask for more, but you get the picture.  Scott, well done!!!"

            "review": "Prime location, delicious food, and great service...our meal at Scarpetta was definitely one of the highlights of our Vegas trip. There were a few missteps on our food adventure, but not nearly discouraging enough to detract from the overall experience. \n\nWe made reservations for 6:30 on Thursday night, which seemed to be the latest time to arrive and get one of the tables overlooking the Bellagio fountains. We got the last one available. The only issue with the view is that there is a giant metal bar running exactly eye level across the window, so you have to pop your head up like a little meercat just to get a glimpse of the fountains. Oh well.\n\nWe ordered the tasting menu and told the waiter that we'd like a bottle of white wine, somewhere in the semi-sweet to semi dry range, full-to-medium bodied, in the $50-60 range. The waiter brought us two options to taste, and we went with a delicious riesling. The bread course came with a lovely tray of marscapone cheese whipped butter, lemon infused olive oil, and a delicious fresh tomato spread. We didn't eat too much, because we knew we had seven courses of awesome heading our way:\n\n1) The first course was yellowtail and tuna sushi. The yellowtail was served with thin pink rock salt wafers that complemented the fish perfectly. The tuna was rolled around marinated vegetables and served with preserved mushrooms. Everything was light, fresh, and flavorful. An excellent way to start a meal. A crispy fritto misto came on the side - the tempura fried herbs and lemon were a delicious addition to the standard tempura fare - shrimp...veggies...etc.\n\n2) The second course was a sea scallop served on top of cauliflower, with a cauliflower puree, chili oil, and a salad with capers on top. - The capers were a bit salty for my liking, so I pulled them off, and the cauliflower with the cauliflower puree was a little redundant, but oh. my. goodness. That scallop was the best I've ever had. The crust was perfectly carmelized, and the scallop inside was tender and melted in your mouth. The small trace of heat from the chili oil added an unexpected twist to the dish and really took it to another level. \n\n3) The chef added in course number three - creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms. My biggest complaint here is that I can never eat anyone else's polenta again. Amazing doesn't even begin to describe it. My friend and I dove into this lake of creamy, buttery, savory goodness with reckless abandon, knowing full well that we were completely spoiling our appetite for the four remaining courses. If nobody had been watching, I would have licked the bowl. We took a little break before moving on in the meal.\n\n4) The pasta course was both a super high and super low note in the meal. After seeing Scott Conant revered as the King of Spaghetti on television time after time, we finally got to see what all the fuss was about. The simple spaghetti dish was amazing. I have never had pasta so perfectly al dente. There was a bite to it that other pastas lack, almost to the point where you feel like it will stick in your teeth, but it doesn't. It was served with a fresh tomato basil sauce that was so perfect, it didn't need any fancy infused oils or architechtural garnishes. It was just pasta perfection. \nHOWEVER, the short ribs angnolotti with brown butter horseradish sauce was just awful. The horseradish sauce blew away every other flavor on the plate, and it wound up tasting like a big plate of mustard. This is the awkward thing about not liking a dish in a tasting course - we were only halfway through the meal and we'd had such good courses previously, that we felt a little awkward sending it back...so we just moved forward with the meal.\n\n5) The next course was a black cod with concentrated tomato sauce and carmelized fennel. Perfect crispy skin, rich, flavorful sauce, and crunchy fresh veggies - definitely a hit.\n\n6) Spiced duck breast with endive, cippolini onions, and a preserved orange - this dish was ingenious. The duck, endive, and onion were perfectly cooked, but it was the addition of the super thin slice of sweet preserved orange that really made the dish. \n\n7) Dessert - simply outstanding - a chocolate lava cake on a streak of carmel sauce with toasted almond gelato on a bed of chocolate cookie crumbs, with a delicate twirl of chocolate as a garnish. \n\nThe only problem with this meal is that it was so delicious, there was no way you could leave anything on your plate. My friend and I polished off every dish - which left us feeling so full that we barely made it out of the restaurant.\n\nIf you decide to attempt this delicious seven course food adventure - open your wallets wide - food, drinks, and tip set us back $350...but it was well worth it."

How silly of me to forget that EVERYTHING IS BETTER IN VEGAS. Here we go...\n\n\nI had the MOST delicious pasta course I've ever had in my entire life. It was short rib ravioli with a balsamic reduction. I try, TRY! not eat bread except when I'm at a restaurant like Scarpetta. Then I will destroy the bread basket and order a refill. I'm gross but if I finally get carbs, I'm going hog wild. Oink.\n\nOnto the entrees and wine. Pete had the Osso Buco and thought it was good. I had the branzino. I don't remember the sides, not to say they were forgettable, we were just so obsessed with the ravioli appetizer. The wine was great, as was the service. Expensive AF and make sure you make a reservation."

You walk up to the bar area which is a skinny hallway that eventually opens up into a beautiful large room. We lucked out and got a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains. It was a really great view and so fun to watch. Our server greeted us right away and he had great suggestions and a good sense of humor, always a plus.  \n\nWe started with the complimentary bread basket and it was super fantastic, possibly my favorite bread basket on the strip! There is a delicious stromboli bread filled with warm meat and cheese. There is also an herb bread, a nice piece of crusty bread, and a little cloud like square pillow of bread. There are also 3 spreads, an eggplant, a mascarpone buttery spread, and a citrus olive oil. I am not a fan of eggplant in general so I didn't try that one but I couldn't decide which of the other 2 I liked more. So yummy!\n\nI started with the Heirloom beet salad. There was an array of different colored beets, 2 little wedges of la tur cheese, a few micro-greens, and some hazelnuts sprinkled throughout the plate. Everyone together was great, I just wish there was a bit more acid to break up the savoriness of the dish. I could only stomach half of it before it just became too rich, luckily my husband was happy to eat the other half. \n\nI moved on to my entree, the short rib agnolotti. The pasta was so delicate and light. The horseradish brown butter had a little kick to it and overpowered the dish just a little. Again, I found this dish very savory and wasn't able to eat the entire plate. Again, my husband saved the day. \n\nMy husband ordered the turbot, it was delicate and so delicious with a light and airy crust. The little parsnips hidden under the fish were my favorite part of the dish, so well done. We also got a side of the broccoli Rabe, which was good but nothing special. \n\nOur waiter talked us into dessert and we were so happy he did. We ordered the Nutella and vanilla creme Bombolini and can't recommend it enough. We received six little fried donuts filled with Nutella or vanilla creme with a yummy caramelized banana on the side. Everything worked so well together. It wasn't overly sweet, just a nice end to the meal. \n\nOverall, we had a great meal with a great view! I would definitely go back, if only for the bread basket."

I say suprisingly because we came here on a whim after the group decided we wanted Italian for dinner. Based on the yelp reviews, and the fact that they are in the posh Cosmo, we were able to make a last minute reservations. \n    The uber contemporary interior was very inviting while giving some great views of the strip and the bellagio fountains. The star of this dinner was by far the spaghetti. The absolute best cooked pasta I have ever had.  The best. House made pasta cooked to a perfect al dente. It actually had that slight \"crunch\" a perfect pasta should have, but raaaaarely does. All the other pastas were fantastic as well.  Scarpetta is a perfect combination of style and execution. I would say a must try."

We were wowed by the wine selection, albeit pricey, and the initial offering of bread and accoutrements laid the groundwork for an amazing dinner. First course consisted of the braised short rib risotto which was so incredibly tender and rich. I also ordered the beef tartare and quail egg which was top notch but came with no surprises. My wife went with the famous spaghetti for her entree and let me tell you, it blows the doors off Gordon Ramsey's beef Wellington (and it's only a few simple ingredients and fresh pasta!). I ordered the lamb with grain mustard and kale which was expertly cooked and delicious. For dessert we had the chocolate cake and the watermelon parfait. I'm not a fruit dessert kind of guy so the parfait didn't appeal to me much but my wife loved it. It did seem rather refreshing. My chocolate cake was insanely rich and delicious but made me wish I had a glass of milk to go with it, haha. All things considered it was my favorite dinner during our trip to Vegas (among visits to Gordon Ramsey's 'Steak', Wolfgang Puck's 'Spago' and a handful of buffets). We will absolutely be going back. Love you Scott Conant!"

I often tend to judge a meal as soon as the bread (or chips... etc) arrives to the table. First impressions are crucial! If you ever dine at Scarpetta, dig for the warm stromboli loaf in your bread basket first! It pairs really wonderfully with the caponata, but also stands strong on its own. You definitely want to eat this bread while its hot- because its stuffed with layers of salami & mozzarella. YUM!\n\nMy first course was Braised Short Ribs of Beef over a farro risotto. The beef was immensely tender & alive with flavor. It had a very thin slice of parmesan resting on top of it, just barely melted. Nice touch! I loved how hearty the risotto was- this is nothing my Mom would have ever prepared for me...but somehow the risotto tasted home-y. I didn't even have time to identify all the vegetables that were in this dish, because I was far too busy stuffing my face. Between bites of the short ribs, I had a few pieces of raw yellowtail. Incredibly fresh, with such great flavor. Unknown to me at the time, it was adorn with almost microscopic red onions (GROSS)...but I ate each piece very willingly- despite my hatred for onions.\n\nFor my main course I had the Aged Sirloin of Beef. It was served with wild mushrooms, potato gnocchi & barolo ragu. Everything on the plate was exceedingly juicy & robust, without being overwhelming. The gnocchi was a great equalizer to the sirloin and the ragu. This dish was really unforgettable, hats off to Scott Conant.\n\nDessert was very simple! Coconut Panna Cotta served with coconut sorbetto, pineapples & guava soup, ofcourse this is my pick- being a true Hawaiian & all. I could have done without the crushed pineapples, I felt like they interfered with the guava coconut vibe I had going. I had mentally prepared myself for the guava soup to be too sweet, but fortunately, I was incorrect. In addition to that, I was thrilled with how smooth the panna cotta was. Each bite was like silk!\n\nIn short, I LOVED Scarpetta. 4 stars!"

The restaurant is located on the third floor at Cosmopolitan Hotel and it is an easy find once you reach there.  It's a nice high end restaurant and you can pick the window seat so you get to overlook the Bellagio fountain.\n\nWe are a huge party so I get to try couple different appetizers and main dish.  I have to say, it is a total disappointment.  Not to bash on their food because the food actually  taste from ok to good, but the food does not taste like the level when you are spending 50 dollars a person.  It lacks that \"wow\" factor.  \n\nTo further breakdown the night, there are two things that wowed me.  First, is their salami bread, it is really tasty and you rarely see it from any other restaurant. Second, is their creamy polenta, you need to eat it while its hot and it is delicious.\n\nHowever, all the other dishes are mediocre at best.  I ordered the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli, and it is SO SALTY.  I love salty food and always add extra pepper and salt on my french fries, and even I have a hard time taking on the saltiness of its Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli.  Also, their tomato & basil spaghetti is very plain.  Taste good if it is $15, but not at $24.  \n\nOne worst part is their restroom.  They have 1 female and 1 male restroom, and you can only use it one person at a time.  So, during the night, people kept waiting in line for restroom.  I understand the fact that you can exit the restaurant and there is another Cosmopolitan restroom outside, but isn't it a little absurd when you have only one bathroom stall in the restaurant.  \n\nOverall, it is not my best Vegas restaurant experience, I would rate it somewhere between 2.5 stars to 3 stars."

The creamy polenta-to die for. You must order it if you only order one starter. The scallops were also so tasty & yummy. I tried most of the pasta dishes. The short rib agniolotti (sp?) very good with these delicious little horseradish crispies on top. The duck foie gras ravioli were also so good (definitely on the rich side). The spaghetti was great too but not my favorite i've ever had. The seafood pasta also was great. Now onto the desserts. You must you must you must order the caramel creme brulee. Amaaaazing. And the nutella little donuts were great too. I am definitely headed soon to the Scarpetta here!"

But who cares; it's the best Italian food in Vegas.\n\nBut the music is WAY too loud for fine dining.  Do I want a hard rock band screaming at me at obscene decibels when I bite into 4 paper-thin pieces of the best Yellow Tail I've put into my mouth, ever?  No, not for $16.  That's 4 bucks a bite, and the hard core, fingernails on a chalkboard in a megaphone screaming is free.\n\nThe wine list is awesome.  Splurge and you'll never regret it.\n\nTheir famous spaghetti is famous for a reason.  $26 for pasta and some sauce.  That's it?  Yes.  And it's worth every penny.\n\nThe veal is stellar on every level, with the chanterelles, mini-me artichokes, fruit reduction, a hint of cumin, and sweet breads (my sweet breads were a little dry, though).  The veal itself is all the crispy outside, tender/moist inside, and intensity of flavors you're hoping for.\n\nThe coconut/guava ice cream desert was very, very good and light.  5 stars.\n\nThe cheese course was only okay.  Three small pieces of cheese the size of my thumb underwhelmed me.  I would pass on this next time.  We were spoiled by Providence's cheese course, though.\n\nAwesome capuccino."

From the delicious variety of bread to the spaghetti, as well as the steak were to die for. \n\nWhat most impressed me, were their portions. It seems as if they know exactly how much a person requires to eat to feel satisfied. For a pasta dish like the spaghetti, you think you are getting a small amount, but take that fork and start eating, and you'll realize that there are endless amount of noodles within that little bowl.\n\nNow, I know that there is a Scarpetta here in LA, but on this lucky night we actually got to eat food prepared by the famous chef Scott Conant himself. I don't know if that makes a big difference or not but after finding out he was our chef, it definitely justified the perfection of our meals."

Secret Pizza, on the other hand, I highly recommend."

I could have eaten a plate of those for dinner.\nThey have a very extensive wine list, but it is all pretty pricey for a bottle. A bottle of Oyster Bay Pinot Noir was $84. I don't mind paying for a good wine but Oyster Bay is far from worth $84. However, we did find a nice bottle for $115. But their wine list ranged from $84 to about $8000.

This may be changing, and Scarpetta is *certainly* one of the biggest reasons why.  \n\nLynn and I followed up our \"good\" dinner Wednesday night at Comme \u00c7a (also Yelped) with dinner at Scarpetta the next night (followed Friday night by LoS, but that's been written up way to many times).  \n\nBeing a Celebrity Chef is a double-edged sword . . . it certainly gets your name out there, but then you (typically) aren't there to defend it -- someone ELSE is in the kitchen is, but if it sucks, you get the blame.  A potentially dicey proposition at best.\n\nScott Conant need not worry; his Vegas outpost is in excellent hands.\n\nThe six of us began with a bottle of n.v. Champagne from Chartogne-Taillet (Cuv\u00e9e Ste.-Anne), and ordered a round of appetizers \"for the table.\"  (The table, too, apparently was hungry -- not just the six of us!)  \n\nFinishing the Champagne just as the appetizers arrived, we moved into a 2008 Bruno Giacosa Arneis.  We enjoyed the yellowtail crudo, the creamy polenta with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms (the winner of this round, IMHO), and the roasted sea scallops with porcini and sunchokes . . . all were delightful!\n\nVEGETARIAN ALERT:  this place is *very* cool, and vegetarian-friendly.  They have a totally separate vegetarian and vegan menu available for the asking (as one in our party did).\n\nMoving into the pasta course, we had the spaghetti with tomato and basil (so simple to say, so profound to eat -- nothing can describe the layers of flavor that you get here; magnificent!), the duck & foie gras ravioli with marsala reduction (OK, this is to die for!), and the short rib agnolotti with with brown butter horseradish.  Of course, we also moved into a stunning Piedmontese red, the 1999 Barbaesco Riserva Vigneti in Ovello from the  Produttori del Barbaresco.  Just gorgeous!\n\nOur entr\u00e9es included black cod with caramelized fennel & concentrated tomato, sirloin with potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, parmigiano & barolo ragu, a veal chop the size of Baltimore (and much more tasty), and the aforementioned spaghetti with tomato and basil (as an entr\u00e9e portion).  \n\nA little dessert, a little Porto and coffee, and the world is a perfect place!\n\nP.S. In case you haven't figured it out yet, their wine list is not only incredible, but there are some true gems on this list that remain real bargains (if you know how/where to look)."

On the show he comes off as a cocky chef who is cocky because he can cook damn well.\n\nWell, all the dishes I sampled were incredibly disappointing. The bread basket was stale. The garden salad that I ordered was soooo overdressed that it was unpalatable. I couldn't taste the sliced beets or even the spicy arugula. It was too vinegary. Maybe a better ratio of oil to vinegar would have improved the flavor. Or no dressing .. .the Caesar salad was similarly overdressed. \n\nFor entrees, my Sig other ordered the marinara pasta with broccoli rabe, I ordered the mezzaluna with basil and ricotta salata. My sig's pasta was a bit too al dente, but it was tasty but not special. The broccoli rabe was absolutely disgusting: it was so over salted that we sent it back. We got another order which was only slightly improved. It also had an aggressive char flavor that was not pleasant. My ravioli was nothing to write home about. It tasted no better than what you could buy at trader Joe's. \n\nI usually love ordering dessert, but I didn't bother with this restaurant. Scott Conant needs a reality check--ironic that he harshly critiques the dishes of others while his need some serious work.\n\nBTW, the restaurant was way too dark. I love mood lighting but this was ridiculous. Don't waste your money here. Go to beauty and Essex for the soup dumplings or Holsteins, if you are staying at the cosmopolitan."

Certain guys clearly have the cred to back it up, but there are others I'm not as familiar with.  Chopped's Scott Conant was one of the latter, but I can now say, without a hint of doubt, that...\n\nSCOTT CONANT IS BAD ASS.\n\nAlthough it may not have been the original Scarpetta in NY, my meal at this location was still pretty fantastic.  I'd even say they rank as one of my all around favorite restaurants, along with The Spence in Atlanta and State Bird Provisions in San Francisco.  Honestly, everything we had was terrific.  It's also easy now to see why Scott Conant is so tough on contestants who dare to cook pasta on the show - Scarpetta's ranks as the best I've had thus far!\n\n-- BREAD BASKET...Complimentary\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#hYFt6DlCGHA332ECJChzLQ)\nNot normally something I would bother mentioning because bread is bread.  That is, unless it's got salami baked into it.  Well played Scott Conant, well played.\n\n-- ROASTED DIVER SCALLOPS with Morels, Sugar Snap, Watermelon Radish and Pea Froth...$23\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#V_vEStj9d5Uur3sAloUvZA)\nMy friend and I split an order and our server was kind enough to have it plated separately for us.  The scallop had a near perfect sear (could have been harder) and the center couldn't have been cooked any better - soft and tender.  The pea froth complemented the scallop's sweetness quite well.\n\n-- DUCK FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI with a Marsala Reduction...$27\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#rJ2lg-UKLTLOss3CPgcrYQ)\nSimply fantastic.  I was already dead set on ordering this, but it was nice to find out it was one of their signature dishes.  The ravioli was amazing - silky and tender with just the right bite.  Although the foie gras filling was awesome on its own, the marsala reduction made it that much better!\n\n-- SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI with Brown Butter, Horseradish, and Toasted Breadcrumbs...$26\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#x9WaFDf-qarVghjn7g-iYA)\nMy friend ordered this one and it gave the ravioli a serious run for its money.  The pasta was just as good in this dish and the short rib added a nice bit of savoriness.  The breadcrumbs didn't do a ton for me, but it still tasted great.\n\n-- STRAWBERRY SOUFFL\u00c9 with a Rhubarb Compote and Vanilla Gelato...$11\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#UUgJpj3_-6a9_rBmpTbrSA)\nNot to gush like a little girl, but damn this was good!  I thought the compote and gelato would be too much sweetness, but the dish had just the right amount of sweetness and the souffl\u00e9 had a perfect consistency.  I honestly don't know what else to say other than that YOU MUST GET THIS.\n\nWhile the meal itself was amazing, I thought some of the hostesses could really use an attitude check.  For some reason, they seem to think they're better than everyone else and do very little to hide it.  It seems other Yelpers have left with the same impression, but at least our waiter Christian and the rest of the wait staff more than made up for it.\n\nBeyond the food and service though, Scarpetta might be worth a trip just to take in the view!  The dining room area (not the bar section) has giant bay windows that face the Bellagio fountains and the strip (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#3OL0vvlkTy4YgBuGuBi7cw).  Unfortunate I was only there with a friend instead of a girlfriend though (sorry bud).  Scarpetta, I'll definitely be seeing you again during my next trip to Vegas.  And considering how often I seem to be there, it'll probably be a lot sooner than later!"

We then got the endive and apple salad and polenta. The salad was fresh and delicious but the polenta was heaven!! Even the mushrooms (I only tried the juice from them) was great. I could eat that polenta everyday. As for dinner, we tried various things but most of us tried the spaghetti. It was funny because my friends recommended it and I almost laughed with them recommending the most basic dish on the amazing menu but I listen. Glad I did- I now have dreams about the spaghetti. I actually asked to go back the next day and get it again but we didn't have time. I have now scoured the internet to get the recipe. Very very highly recommended. We also tried the Pici and Agnolotti. Both were to die for. The agnolotti was actually a huge hit at our table.

Service was great.  Their wine is is fair.  They had a couple of choices for 1/2 bottle pinot noir at a decent price.\nOysters- The kumamotos (sp?) were pretty good.  They came with a vinaigrette added already\nCreamy Polenta- Very good.  \nShort ribs Agnolotti- The best dish of the night.  Loved the hint of horseradish amid the butter sauce\nSpagetti-  A tad on the bland side.  But liked the home made pasta.\nCreme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e-    Not your typical creme brulee.  This was a deconstructed version and was \"interesting\".  Probably wouldn't get it again.  \n\nAll in all, a good meal."

As we had planned poorly and did not make reservations, it was excellent that this restaurant had a high table available in the bar area for immediate seating.\n\nDrinks - most of us went with Old Fashioned (various bourbons) and service was prompt and correct every time.\n\nFood - most of us ate pretty light as it was our first night in Vegas, but there were a few notable items:\n1.  The bread selection was amazing!  The different selections and butter/oil to pair was great.\n2.  The duck fois gras was amazing!  Great taste while not overpowering everything else.   \n\nOur experience was great, but the billing (covering for my brother on his birthday) caused quite the confusion when billing everything out.  The receipts almost needed an accounting expert to discern, but everything ended up correct in the end.  Overall 4 stars with a NEAR higher rating.  I had seen that some were able to get a tour of the kitchen, but it did not appear this was in the cards for us tonight!  Maybe next time."

OpenTable didn't have a reservation available for that day and I thought I was out of luck. We happen to be at the Cosmopolitan anyways and went upstairs to do a drop in... luckily they had a table for two with a Fountain view and all!\n\nI can't say enough good things about the breadbasket it was amazing. The caponata I could've eaten 10 bowls. \n\nBut I wisely left some room for apps and the main. I had the beet and burrata salad. The dressing on the beets was tangy and the burrata very rich and smooth. It was also beautifully composed. My companion had the polenta. Which was just as sinfully creamy as they said it would be.\n\nFor main I had the bone marrow agnolotti. Rich little pillows of beefy heaven. And the breadcrumb crunch on top...perfect. And of course we had to try the famous spaghetti. There's a reason they're famous for it. Sauce clings to the noodles and transports you to Italy...get it."

Quiet with smooth hits from the 80s playing in the backround. \n\nThe service was great and our server was very knowledgeable about the food and wine.  He recommended a great wine based on our specifications.\n\nI tend to judge a restaurant by their breadbasket and Scarpetta gets an A+++. Skip the Italian bread they put on top of the basket and get to the cheese and pepperoni Stromboli.  I could have left happy after that.. it was amazing! The bread comes with olive oil, whipped marscapone and a tomato type sauce. \n\nWe started with the Scallops and beet salad.  Both were excellent.  The Scallops ( 2 good sized scallops) were cooked perfectly.  The beet salad was nothing super fancy but I knew that when I ordered it.\n\nMy parents both opted for meatier entrees- Dad the veal chop and mom the NY strip.  My moms meat was slightly undercooked but she opted not to send it back to be cooked more.. Both were excellent.  I had heard so much about the Spaghetti that I decided to try that.  It was the best spaghetti I had ever had so it is definitely worth trying if you want a pasta dish.\n\nFor dessert we go the chocolate molten cake and it was the best Id ever had! The salted caramel sauce was a nice touch.  \n\nI'd definitely go back to Scarpetta.  I liked it better than the other Italian options I've tried in Vegas (B&B, Carnevino)."

            "review": "While looking for a place to have dinner, I only needed to read 5 words to convince me to try this place out.  Those five magical words were \"duck and fois gras ravioli.\"  Umm...yes please!  So with little hesitation we called in for a reservation and I excitedly awaited dinner time.\n\nOnce we arrived at Scarpetta, we noticed that the decor was nice but not stuffy.  The people in the dining area seemed to be enjoying themselves and the view overlooking the Bellagio fountain just added to the overall ambiance of the restaurant.  The ambiance and decor definitely work well to add to the dining experience at this restaurant.\n\nThe service was also another thing that was nice and attentive but not overly intrusive.  They were very quick to take our drink orders and were quick to come back once they noticed we were ready to order.  They also did a great job of explaining all the complimentary breads and butters as well as fielding any other question we had.  \n\nNow for the important part, the food.  Here's a quick break down of what we had:\n\nComplimentary Bread:\n\nOrdinarily I wouldn't even mention this.  I mean, there are some restaurants that give you some phenomenally good bread but here is the thing that puts Scarpetta above and beyond those other places.  The stromboli!  Holy moly this thing is good.  Bread baked around cheese and pepperoni (I think it was pepperoni) was just so good.  I honestly could have had this for dinner and I would've have been completely happy.\n\nAppetizers:\n\nTuna Susci -   Assorted marinated veggies and preserved truffles wrapped in tuna.  I suppose this was the chef's interpretation of a sushi roll but I have to say that it just fell flat.  I mean with truffle and tuna in the mix I am still scratching my head as to how this couldn't be good, but it just wasn't.  It was bland and under-seasoned.  My recommendation, don't get it.\n\nBeet Salad - Pretty much what you expect of a beet salad.  A great assortment of different beets with pumpkin seeds and stracciatella cheese with a balsamic dressing, it was refreshing and delicious.\n\nBraised Short Ribs of Beef - This was by far my favorite appetizer.  The short rib was succulent and delicious.  Bedded on root veggies and risotto, this in a larger portion would make an amazing entree, let alone an outstanding appetizer.\n\nEntree:\n\nIndulge me for just a second while I draw a perverted metaphor.  If dinner were a porno, the bread was the nasty making out, the appetizers the foreplay, then the duck and fois gras ravioli would be the money shot.  Goodness sakes alive this is one delicious pasta.  A nice big plate of perfectly cooked ravioli with a drizzle of marsala reduction; these decadent little bites were heaven in tiny little pockets of pasta.  If you like duck and fois gras, this is a must!\n\nOverall, I had a great meal here.  I thought the prices were reasonable for Vegas fine dining, the ambiance great, the service spot on, and the food was just phenomenal.  Honestly, if I hadn't gotten the tuna susci appetizer, this would have been just about the perfect meal, but even the susci couldn't dissuade me from giving Scarpetta a well deserved 5 stars.  Bravo!"

It was heaven. I could eat that every day. Due to our state of being at the time, dessert was not an option but next time I will be definitely be indulging. Can't wait to return!"

Yes, it is indeed pricey, but that should be expected with any fine dining experience no matter where you are.\n\nI can only comment on the dishes I tried, so here they are:\n+ Complimentary bread & spread - All of the bread was great. For our spread, we had olive oil, egg plant, and marscapone cheese. I've always preferred butter instead of olive oil, but this one was quite tasty. The olive oil had an almost herbal/spice taste to it. The egg plant is prepared with a tomato sauce or something, so it paired really well with the stromboli bread.\n+ Roasted Sea Scallop appetizer - Delicious, practically melts in your mouth. The portion is rather small as you only get two.\n+ Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli - Very rich to the point where it was almost a struggle to finish the plate, but it was so scrumptious, I couldn't stop eating.\n+ Spaghetti - Probably one of the best I've ever had. Pasta perfectly al dente with just tomato and basil, but the sauce had a creaminess to it that made it divine.\n+ Black Cod - Another great dish, but overshadowed by all of the other fantastic plates. It was seasoned well. The accompanying cherry tomatoes tasted so bright. If I ever go to Scarpetta again, though, I'd probably forego this dish and try something else.\n\nLastly, to expand on the service aspect, our waiter was very personable, cracking a few jokes throughout the night. He was helpful with making suggestions on the menu and explaining everything. Our water glasses never really went low. Oh, and the view of the Bellagio fountain was gorgeous. Only downside is the window divider thing was right at eye level, so we had to look above or below it to see. Definitely a wonderful restaurant for a date night, though."

Outstanding cocktails.\n\nWe were lucky enough to get a seat right by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. If you're looking for a relaxed dinner with a semi - formal atmosphere, this is your place. I loved the formality yet relaxed environment, and appreciated how friendly the staff was! \n\nThe short rib agnolotti is like nothing else I've tried. Light yet hearty with a bit of crunch and the portion was just right. It's one of those dishes that can get monotone after a while, but this portion is just right to where it doesn't allow that to happen. \n\nI had the Orecchiette which was also phenomenal. The homemade sausage brought it to another level, although a bit bitter from the broccoli rabe. \n\nWe finished off with the chocolate cake and the strawberry souffl\u00e9. They were both very delicious, but I don't think it was anything that blew me out of the water when it came to dessert. Definitely worth trying though! I'm just particular about my desserts.\n\nAll in all, phenomenal dinner. We will be back!"

And, this treat was truly the highlight of my meal. If it weren't for that and the beautiful surrounds, the meal would have been a tad disappointing. \n\nSince inhaling about 10 of their yellow tail tuna at Taste of the Nation, I have been eagerly awaiting a trip. Of course, we had an order of yellow tail, and I must say the preparation was better at Taste of the Nation. Not sure how serving it up poolside away from their kitchen could produce a superior product, but the seasoning wasn't singing quite the same tune. Nonetheless, it is still a good dish. \n\nWe decided to order the spaghetti because we were told it was featured on Best Thing I Ever Ate. The dish was good, but the tomato basil sauce wasn't unexpected. The flavors were delicious, but in a middle of the road way, not a fine dining way. I have had similar sauces at much lesser restaurants that delivered the same gustatory satisfaction for a much lower price point.\n\nIf you are going to dine here, I personally think you should skip the spaghetti despite its hype. For my visit, the food overall hovered around a 3, but the space is absolutely gorgeous especially if you get a seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Make that happen, and you've got a very promising spot for a date."

Though, you'd get a much better view if you were a party of 2 seated right by the window, of course! \n\nService was great! Our server gave great recommendations and the other wait staff were fantastic! They kept bringing basket after delicious basket of bread with that citrus-infused olive oil and refilled our drinks constantly!\n\nWe ordered the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms to share, duck and foie gras ravioli, pan-seared escolar with sun chokes, American Wagyu rib cap and a lobster pasta  that was the daily special. The polenta was AMAZING!! We shared it but I was ready to order another for myself. The polenta itself was so fine that it added to its creaminess and then topped with the truffled mushroom sauce added to its heavenliness! All our entrees were delicious (as evidenced by the fact that nothing was left behind), except the  lobster pasta. While I enjoyed the fresh and sweet lobster and LOVE the freshly made chewiness of the pasta (think udon in terms of thickness), the combination together with the sauce was not incredibly tasty. It almost resembled a lobster bisque type sauce and I think it made the dish too \"seafood-y.\" Hands down our table's favorite was the American Wagyu rib cap - WOW!!! The meat itself was incredibly tender and so divine that it just melted in your mouth. Even without the sauce reduction that accompanied it, the beef was naturally flavorful and worth its price tag. You don't get much but, you definitely get a phenomenal piece of meat! As for the ravioli, like others have mentioned, it was a bit on the salty side and even before our order, I mentioned it to our server and he gladly told us that the dish can be altered to fit our tastes. The escolar, not on the menu, was perfectly cooked and just as juicy and flaky as fish should be - delicious! \n\nOverall, the order came out to be a bit over $200 with 2 iced teas, 1 appetizer and 4 entrees. It was well worth the deliciousness that filled our bellies, the unique experience of being in such a gorgeous atmosphere and great service! I would visit again in a heart beat and save my $$$ for the next special occasion."

It was a blast!)\n\nIn any event, we made a reservation for 10 of us. That managed to land us in one of their private rooms (which I didn't request, mind you) overlooking the Bellagio fountains. That right there was enough to make us all feel like rock stars. And, as an added bonus, we got to control the lighting and music volume in the room (I really don't like the music they play there, but it's easy enough to tune out.)\n\nThe service we received was absolutely impeccable. The waiter came along and explained the entire menu to us, calling out the highlights. We did an appetizer course of our own mix and match - just ordering a bunch of stuff off the menu, including the above mentioned duck foie gras ravioli so everyone could have a taste. For my entr\u00e9e I wound up going with the lamb, which was out of this world spectacular - probably one of the top lamb dishes I've ever had.\n\nThe couple of little gripes I have - the wine menu is very expensive.

First of all, i made the reservations over a week in advance, After reading all of the reviews here, I requested to be sat next to the windows to see the fountains. Upon arriving there, they sat us in the 2nd row from the window. I asked about it and they said it was 'first come first serve', even though i had requested it in my reservations. Luckily, the couple next to us heard and switched us seats because they had already eaten there before and seen the view. It was really sweet of the couple. We actually had to wait for our menu, even though we had already sat down, which was really weird. It took maybe 10 minutes or so for them to give us menus. \n\nWe ordered the yellowtail appetizer. For entrees, I ended up ordering the short rib agnolotti and my boyfriend ordered the chicken with a side of brussel sprouts.  The yellowtail was so so, the fish was fresh but it didn't really have enough umph. The bread course was AMAZING. They had mascarpone butter, citrus oil and an olive tapenade that was to die for. i wasn't crazy about the agnolotti...I was actually pretty disappointed. There no actual sauce to the pasta, which for me was a misstep. Short rib and marrow are in nature very rich and oily but when i had it for leftovers, the oil was excessive to the point of it being disgusting. The brussel sprouts were the star of the night for me. Side dishes aren't usually that special but i could eat an entire bucket of these things if someone let me. I liked the chicken my boyfriend had but he didn't care for it. We ended the night with the nutella and vanilla bombolis and those were super delicious.\n\nAll in all, i think i would go again, but i would definitely order different things. I know he's known for his spaghetti and i totally regret to getting that."

Scarpetta LV is light years ahead of its namesake in Manhattan's Meatpacking district. \nThe service is, without a question, much better here than in NYC and so was the food. Scarpetta NYC, on the other hand, has a quirkier, much more interesting wine list featuring Italian wines exclusively. \nSo, I guess you'd have to visit both locations and decide for yourself."

            "review": "Before I went there I had read a few yelp reviews and I have to say that I expected something more. Not that it's a bad place, just nothing to write home about.\n\nThe interior is very classy and elegant - dark wood, candles and comfortable white couches. The light is soft and dimmed, so it's a perfect spot for romantic, candlelit dinners. As in the majority of such sophisticated Italian restaurants the menu is very short and well-considered. There is no banality there, the flavors are mixed in surprising, interesting ways - you can see that the chef wanted to do something different. They also have a lot of vegetarian and gluten free dishes, which is not so common. The waiter was very professional and knew exactly when the food should be served or taken from the table. He also recommended great drinks and desserts.\n\nThe bread they serve as a apetizer is fresh, soft and savoury - delicious. For a main course I decided to try short rib agnolotti with brown butter, horseradish & toasted breadcrumbs. It tasted good, but was a bit on a small side and left me still hungry. My friends' portions were a bit bigger and they were satisfied with the flavors. The really good part were the desserts, we ordered mascarpone cheescake and banana souffle. They were perfect, not as heavy or as sweet as I though. The Berry Smash was also great! I had a few and I have to say there is waaaaaay more alcohol there than in Poland, where I live. It's easy to get tipsy.\n\nSo why only an \"ok\" grade? The prices are pretty high and the food is just ok. The concept itself may be interesting but the result is no so great as to overpay. There is probably a lot of Italian restaurants which are just as good or maybe even better."

            "review": "Hidden on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan, Scarpetta is the place to visit to learn what really good pasta can be like.\n\nAs a pasta fiend, I am very picky when it comes to pasta.  Scarpetta has shown me another dimension to pasta that I must learn.  The minimalist approach where pasta is the star, and the sauce or other items are addendums.\n\nAllow me to expound:\n\nSignature Spaghetti: Normally a staple of the American diet, lifted from Italy, it is most commonly served with tomato, carbonara, or meat sauce. Since I make spaghetti at home, I always believed in what I thought I liked.  This dish showed me that a very simple, light sauce can accompany the pasta and \"show it off\" in a way that the pasta shines above the sauce.  A large portion is not required as the fresh pasta is rich and heavy.  The sauce is light, and delicately flavorful, allowing the pasta flavor to come out instead of being more of a \"texture\" experience.  When presented with this dish, one might think \"Where is the sauce?\", but when finished the response will be: \"I didn't miss it\"\n\nDuck & Foie Gras Ravioli:  Again, simple in presentation and execution, the difference is in the details.  I normally don't like duck, and find foie gras to be overly rich and intense when served alone.  The blended filling, in just the right proportion to pasta was a grand pleasure and I will be looking or ANY excuse to have this dish again.  Again, the sauce is minimal at best and the dish relies on the pasta and filling almost entirely to achieve its goal.\n\nLesson Learned: Extravagant sauces are used to cover up mediocre pasta offerings\n\nAppetizer Bonus: Creamy Polenta with Fricassee of Mushroom: This dish, served in a moderately small portion was a flavor and texture experience that reinforces the axiom that quality is small amounts is the most flavorful, and healthy for you experience.  Having watched its manufacture on the Food Channel, the secret is in the long prep.  Like tamahagane, it must be nurtured for hours (3) to achieve the complete assimilation of the polenta kernel into the dish, resulting in a creaminess of exceptional quality.\n\nAll in all, I learned the perception of the Minimalist, the discipline of the Stalwart, and the reminder that food is art in the presentation.\n\nMy most basic position:  I will look for ANY excuse to visit Scarpetta in the future.\n\nSundries:  As with any restaurant of this caliber, service was impeccable.  Even though I dined alone on several occasions, several people inquired as to my satisfaction each visit.  I cannot say enough.  As a lone diner, I felt as attended to as any other party and normally I can't stand eating alone as one tends to get treated like a pariah.  Not the case here!"

But seriously, they MUST have Italian grandmas cranking out homemade pasta by the pound. Easily the best Italian food I've had. Definitely an upscale place. I've had several food items (spaghetti, foie gras and duck ravioli, ribeye, multiple glasses of wine, raw yellowtail, pici, short ribs, and the dessert doughnuts) and every single thing is delicious. Service is perfect, I was never in want of anything. Servers are knowledgeable and passionate about what they're serving. Also wonderful wine recommendations. Something that I din't expect is getting the best steak I've had in this city here. Their ribeye is without a doubt the finest piece of red meat I've had in my life. If STK is too busy (it is), but you still want a great steak, come on over to Scarpetta. You will not be disappointed. Another great thing to mention is the view. Wanna wow your lady with a great view of the Bellagio fountains? Make a reservation and request it."

(and if there was anything below 0, that would be it!) \n\nI saw the famous Scarpetta spaghetti on Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" and since that episode, I have been obsessed with going to Scarpetta. So excited that one opened up in Beverly Hills last October! However, I've been too busy to make the drive out there. \n\nI was in Vegas for 1 night on April 1st and while wandering around The Cosmpolitan Hotel, saw Scarpetta! Super excited! Made reservations for 8PM. Arrived on time and was seated promptly. Then waited, waited and waited! Really, 10 minutes before our waitress even came by our table (and empty seats all around us at this time)! Mind you, we had a 10PM show so I kept looking at the time... She took our drink order then returned 15 minutes later with our drinks!!! So almost 8:30 and have not even placed our order. She says she'll be \"right back\" and another 10 minutes.... Ahh, if it weren't for that spaghetti, we would have walked out! So 35 minutes after we arrived, she takes our order. \n\nSpaghetti for me and braised short ribs of beef for my husband. OMG.. our food arrived at out table at 9:30! Ate fast (because we had tickets to a show at 10). BTW, the food was amazing!!!! \n\nHad to ask another waiter to find our waitress so we can get the check. She came back to our table at 9:50 (without the check of course) and I explained again we had a 10PM show (which we ended up being late for) and needed to get out of there! \n\nSo the food was as good as I thought it woud be but the service (or lack of) ruined my first Scarpetta experience :("

The bar scene was non existent on the Saturday night i was there, but the dining room had a great pulse. I recommend a pre dinner drink at the many cool spots of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and then come enjoy a fantastic meal at Scarpetta."

You would have to absolutely LOVE horseradish to even enjoy this dish. \n\nMy date ordered The Risotto with vegetables from the Vegetarian menu which was just mixed diced vegetables.

It is a small list of places I would go every visit, and even though I like to try new places, my special list always beckons...\n\nThe time has come to add a new place to this Elite list...welcome Scarpetta.\n\nReservation made for Christmas dinner 2015 (made it 3 days in advance), located on level 3 of the Cosmopolitan and we requested a window seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Upon being greeted by the lovely set of hostesses (who were very classy mind you), our request was honored, and our table was AMAZING.\n\nWe had some awesome servers helping us, our main waiter was Garvin (I hope I spelled it right). He was extremely nice, great attitude, plenty of \"just right\" conversation, funny, personable, and I could not have enough praise for his knowledge of the menu, Las Vegas cuisine, and his general awareness of what it means to be a good host for a restaurant. He gets 5 stars alone!\n\nThe ambiance is dark, seductive, and enchanting. The place is mostly \"quiet\" and intimate, with dim lighting, gorgeous wood flooring and well-appointed d\u00e9cor. \n\nWe ordered a couple drinks. I had a variation of the Moscow Mule  and it was superb. My gf (who always takes forever to pick a wine) had two she was interested in, and our waiter brought both for her tasting. She finally chose a Pinot Noir, and really enjoyed it. \n\nOur appetizers were:\n\n- Warm Beet Salad...AMAZING IN EVERY WAY! The temp was perfect. The beets were soft and tasty, the shaved parsnip was bitter and palate pleasing.\n\n- Tuna and Avocado. This was divine. Tuna, Avo, micro greens...just perfect.\n\nThe bread basket (free):\n\n- Yes, I will rave about the free bread. I don't normally even eat bread but it was Xmas Dinner so sue me! Haha...the stuffed \"Stromboli Bread\" oh my god. good. The sourdough, the ciabatta, the olive oil and rosemary squares...holy hell on a stick Batman...!! The bread was delicious and it came with an eggplant tapenade, marscapone butter, and a light olive oil...oh man...wow.\n\nThe Pasta:\n\n- I got the Short Rib Agnolotti.  The flavor depth of the wagyu short rib, the bone marrow broth, the dark rich sauce and the fresh mini-ravioli pasta...was amazing. It didn't look like a huge portion, but looks were deceiving...it was a lot of food. This is now a TOP 5 dish favorite in Las Vegas. \n\n- My lady got a Gluten-Free variation on the Spaghetti & Sauce. It was the same tomato and basil fresh sauce, with gf noodles and they added just enough garlic, olive oil and shaved cheese to it. This was simply an amazing spaghetti and sauce. I mean...wow again.  Simple, flavorful, and filling. \n\nOn the side:\n\n- We added Brussels sprouts to our mains and they were great. Toasted macrona almonds with just a bit of smokiness. Lemon oil, garlic, oh man these sprouts were luscious. I am going to try to make these at home. This side alone was so worth it (seriously). Try them.\n\n***  ***  ***  ***\n\nAll of the food came out in good order to not clutter the table. The servers and staff always knew when to clear a plate or fill something. They were ever-present but not annoying. Honestly, the service was perfect. This was a great Christmas dinner, and one to remember for so many reasons...they even brought out a light dessert course for us since it was my birthday the week prior (with a lemon bar, a berry jelly candy, a chocolate, and little cookie).\n\nIf ever I write 1,000 words for a Yelp! review let it be Scarpetta. People, you cannot go wrong here. With drinks, appetizer, salad, and two entrees, we were around $150, throw in a well deserved great tip, and it was a delightful dinner, perfectly executed for under $200 in an amazing seat to see the Bellagio show and enjoy a quiet and intimate atmosphere. \n\nI'm coming back soon, I promise!"

Basically perfect. One down side - they were not offering the tasting menu the evening I was there. As a fan of tasting menus (especially with wine pairings!) this was disappointing. Anyway, as others have mentioned, the bread is great. We also started with the short rib risotto appetizer as well as the fritto misto. Both were delightful. As far as the entrees - myself and my 3 dining partners all got pasta. The spaghetti (again, as many other reviewers have commented on) was wonderful. I don't think I've EVER ordered spaghetti at a restaurant and probably wouldn't had I not read the rave reviews on yelp (though the waiter did highly recommend it). It was simple yet extremely tasty. The only gripe I have is it seemed a little overpriced given the minimalistic dish (~$24) but was fair given the prices of other dishes on the menu. We also tried the duck and foie gras ravioli which was rich and delicious. The beef short rib pasta was also very good, though a little too horseradishy for my taste. \n\nThe food would've earned the restaurant 5 stars in my book regardless, but the service made the experience one of a kind. Maybe the waiter has the same \"routine\" for everyone, but who cares? He was attentive, friendly, professional but not at all annoying. \n\nThe only bad part about the night is I didn't get to try dessert (too full)!"

Recommended a few good dishes. Since we were a party of 16, I understand we probably took a little longer to order as we were all deciding on what to order, but the server did not rush us at all. Everything came out in a timely manner.\n\nThey had 3 different types of bread with three different spreads, butter, some eggplant tomato-y dip, and citrus herb olive oil (definitely the best one). Just that alone was yummy. Most of us skipped an appetizer as we weren't too hungry. One guest, however, did order their yellowtail. The few bites I was able to sneak were tasty! It had a citrus flavor to it, and if you know me, then you know I drown everything in lemon.\nFor the entrees, I ordered their lobster pasta dish. It was very pleasant. With higher end restaurants, dishes tend to be more salty or over seasoned, which I cannot stand, but it wasn't at all. The pasta was thick and cooked perfectly. I was also able to taste the foie gras. I've never had it before and did not like that at all. The guest who ordered it, however, usually loves foie gras and didn't like it either. She said it tasted too bland. She wanted to speak to someone about it, but the waiter hardly checked on us. I also tried the short rib and bone marrow pasta dish. It was delicious. I loved the fried garlic to give it more of a crunch.\n\nFor dessert, most of us ordered their Nutella dessert, which by the way, is superb! I grew up on Nutella, and it brought me back to my childhood. It was pretty much sugar donuts filled with warm Nutella with a side of banana ice cream. Yummmmmy. Another couple at the table shared their guava dessert. It was the perfect mixture of fruits, not too sweet either!\n\nNow for the bill splitting. We all individually calculated how much was going on each card, which was extremely time consuming and inconvenient that we had to do it ourselves, since he \"couldnt do it\".  The bill altogether wasn't too bad, and they didn't charge gratuity for that large of a party, but for this nice of a restaurant, I'd expect atleast a little happy birthday for my brother in law, but oh well.

And I don't say that lightly.\n\nI would've been happy with either the fluffy dinner rolls, the buttery, toasted focaccia, or the simple, crusty Italian bread on their own. And any one of the citrus-infused olive oil, the eggplant caponata or the marscopone butter accompaniments would have been not only generous, but irresistibly delicious.\n\nSurprisingly, Scarpetta lays every one of these items in front of you in a sumptuous, complimentary carby feast, along with the absolute kicker: STROMBOLI. That's meaty, cheesey bread, people; it's a meal in itself, and a damn good one. \n\nI knew I shouldn't, but I couldn't help but stuff my face with the free delights. And although I was already full when they arrived, I forced myself to choke down the simple, perfect spaghetti, as well as a beautifully rare aged sirloin in a Barolo reduction.\n\nI might not have any friends and/or social skills, and later that evening, I may or may not have lost my pants* downstairs playing craps...but eating this flawless meal means I'm a winner anyway.\n__________\n\n*I think The Bellagio is now in possession of my shirt.

            "review": "Let me first say that I went to Scarpetta just to try their dessert.  My friend and I had eaten dinner at a nearby restaurant in Cosmopolitan and wanted to try another place for dessert.  We first checked out the menu posted right outside the door of the restaurant and figured that the desserts sounded tasty so we should give it a shot.  When we first went in, they asked for our reservation.  We did not have any, so we elected to sit in one of the booths near the bar.  For dessert, I ordered the Peach Crostata since I really like peaches.  The dessert was described as moscato peaches, almonds, cinnamon and cardemom gelato.  It came in a clear glass.  I was expecting the dessert to be very sweet and savory, but it wasn't really any of those.  It wasn't anything extraordinary.  It just tasted like a regular dessert.  I understand that most customers do not come here just for dessert, but I figured with the great reviews and pricing that it would be something worth trying.  I guess I was wrong.  Maybe their food is better than their desserts, but there wasn't anything special on this end."

Polenta was super creamy, and the food runner said  he was topping with truffles, while menu said mushroom fricassee. Either way it was soupy. We had asked about a greens type salad and the server said that a Caesar was an option. Dressing was great, but there was too much. Croutons were at least a week old, stale and gross. The pasta which we were most excited about was not al dente, as promised. The ragu was good, but the dish was just a bowl of noodle mush. Brussels sprouts cooked well, but were missing the promised sage pesto and the walnuts. Also I don't believe they seasoned them. We left them uneaten. Gelato-lemongrass was fine but bland, almond was icy as f. Seems like these acclaimed chefs can't control quality like they do at their flagship locations. Vegas is like the red headed step child. Scott Contant can give brutal critiques on chopped, but he may need to take some of his own advice."

We choose to wait at the bar for a table in the restaurant, where it seemed to be more quiet. They told us the wait could be up to an hour, but we didn't really care.\n\nWe allready had a few cocktails before we came in, so I started to drink lots of water. We had to share our snack basket (patato chips, nice!) with the people sitting next to us. They shove it to their side of the bar, we didn't steal it back, so far the enjoyment of snacks. \n\nAfter about 30 minutes it seemed like more and more people came in without reservation, but they were all given a table in the restaurant. We were still enjoying the bottled water, but after an hour waiting, my boyfriend walked up to the reception and they made our table ready, thanking us for the long wait. When we were seated, we noticed that the restaurant wasn't that full anymore. We were seated at a table apart from the other guest, in the corner of an almost empty room, where it wasn't that warm. They gave us some really nice bread and I didn't want to be snobby, but I did ask for another table. They were very nice and gave us a table by the window, overlooking the B fountains. Not that we especially wanted that, but we did like to sit closer to other people. Experiencing a restaurant isn't just about the food, it's also he temperature, the views, looking at other guest and the over all service.\n\nAnyway, after this, everything was great. My boyfriend and I shared 4 courses, which were all perfectly made: the tartare, the foie gras ravioli, the organic chicken and the goat cheese cake. I was really stuffed (I also had 3 bottles of water) and happy. Service was great, although we were asked a little to much if everything was okay. In Holland we are not used to all that attentiveness.\n\n6 stars for the food, 4 for the somewhat weird start = 5 stars."

We ended up getting there at 10:30 pm, and the hostesses were still so sweet despite our late arrival! We even got awesome seating with a view of the Bellagio water fountains, per Hubby's request of course. It's overall such a romantic venue with dim lights and soft lounge music.\n\nYou start off with complimentary bread, and it's honestly the best bread I've ever had. The basket has an assortment of different breads and condiments. The winner was the Stromboli- soft Italian bread filled with delicious cheese and salami. Ugh, orgasmic!\n\nWe also began with Raw Yellowtail which was topped with a ginger oil and pickled red onion. For a steep $18, it was rather disappointing. We each only got 2 bite-sized pieces of fish. Very tasteful fish, but still a let down.\n\nMy entr\u00e9e made up for our appetizer. I ordered the Short Rib Agnolotti- fresh pasta filled with tender beef. It was a mouth-watering combination of sweet brown butter and toasted breadcrumbs. So delicious!\n\nHubby ordered the waiter's recommended Pici, a pasta colored green by chili pesto. He thought it was a bit salty, and our sides were on the salty side as well. We shared an order of mushrooms & corn, which were both bursting with flavor. It was so much food, we left with some to-go boxes.\n\nSince you can never be too full for dessert, we ordered the Strawberry Souffl\u00e9 with berries and vanilla gelato. We almost ordered a second one, a strong indication of how yummy it was. It tasted exactly how I'd imagine clouds would- Sweet, light, & fluffy. What was even sweeter was the \"Happy Birthday\" message written on the plate next to a candle. You just can't beat thoughtful service like this. :')"

They were hospitable and made sure everything was set in order for you. Their selection looked great. The dish I chose was $45 (Prime Beef whatever lol I'm not sure what the dish was called). It was tasty but small. I will admit, I like to enjoy my food but I do want some quantity in it as well. For that $45, I would be able to get a bigger piece of beef elsewhere, however, it wouldn't have been cooked by the famous chef and that restaurant. Sadly, I do not ever no who that is. HAHA! Nonetheless, the beef was amazing and tasted great. The side potatoes and mushrooms added flavor to the beef and mixed well.\n\nWhen it comes to the drinks, I advise you just get it elsewhere. Small martinis or little drinks were $15+ and when it came to wine, just be careful with your wallet! Some bottles are worth over $1500! And that's wine that was bottled in 2002-2005! Just go to the nearest store and enjoy that Stella Rosa!"

The manager on the phone immediately became defensive instead of apologetic and told me that food poisoning does not kick in until 8 hours later and that it was probably something else we had eaten during the day.  Mind you... this was the only meal and time that my boyfriend had spent together all day.   I had also called only 30 minutes after they had opened for the evening and she told me that it couldn't have been the food because they didn't receive any other calls regarding any episodes of food poisoning and we ordered popular items on the menu.  (Braised short rib, chicken, and a pasta dish). I still can't believe that I had to justify our ill feelings with someone who showed no compassion and was challenging me on the authenticity of my statement.\n\nShe eventually transferred me to security to fill out a report.

It was a sad moment when I took my last bite of amazingness and realized I was already having separation anxiety with my Duck and foie gras ravioli. Not to mention the mouth orgasm I had after over indulging in the Bombolini dessert with nutella dust. (Went back the following night for an encore performance ). I am not going to sit here all day and rave about how perfect the beef tartare was or how life altering the short rib angolottis were, but what i will do is tell anyone who has anything bad to say about Scarpetta, you honestly don't have a clue what good food is all about. I just read 30 reviews and one person had said \"The duck ravioli flat out sucked\" Dude STFU and have some respect. I guarantee you are the type of DB that enjoys the food at Olive garden. Get a grip. Here is my run down from a foodie who has traveled the world in search of great cuisine and spend 10 years running kitchens:\n\nService-\nFrom the hostess to the table service, everything surpassed my high expectations. Very attentive without being over bearing. Luis was very sociable and you could tell he wasn't trying to up-sell anything and he gave his honest opinion when needed. Very knowledgeable about the menu and was honestly fantastic.\n\nAmbiance-\nVery comfortable, modern atmosphere complimented by great music and bellaggio fountains.\n\nFood Quality-\nFRESH PASTA! Come on how can you complain about fresh pasta  I guess if you like rubber olive garden garbage pasta and you didn't enjoy the king of pasta's execution then your review is null.\n\nOverall Food Experience-\nThere is only one way to sum up Scarpetta so the common man can understand how great this experience is: \n\nIf you like the fake bread sticks and man made olive oil at Olive garden then you aren't going to like the FRESH baked bread and stromboli complimented by lemon olive oil, eggplant capanata, or marscapone butter.\n\nIf you like frozen pasta that been frost bitten for 2 years, then your aren't going to enjoy fresh made pasta stuffed with delicate meats such as duck or short rib.\n\nIf you go to the outback and are really wowed by the meat quality then you aren't going to understand the complexity of meat that they use here. \n\nSo for you complaining feeble minded yelpers, stay away from Scarpetta, you do not deserve to enjoy and embrace what this amazing restaurant has to offer. To the foodies who share my same enthusiasm for this amazing restaurant, you know how excited I am to go back."

Two of us ordered the famous Spaghetti, Mr, Buxton ordered the Foie Gras Ravioli, and Mr. Bloewen ordered the Linguini.  \n\nThe Spaghetti had a lot of hype, but I can clearly say it was the best Spaghetti that I have ever had.

As Mr. Buxton was eating it, he just kept saying, \"Wow.

Great flavors and cooked to perfection.  The only problem was the Mr. Bloewen had a bit too much to drink prior to dinner, and was not able to finish the meal (basically committing a crime). The rest of us got too full to help him out, but it should be no knock to the dish.\n\nWe also enjoyed a couple $16 dirty martinis (clearly overpriced), and had an overall great dinner.\n\nWhy 4 stars and not 5, you ask?\nWell, I felt as though service was a bit snooty, and the spaghetti was good, but clearly overpriced.  I was not sure why our waiter was looking down at us, and not very friendly.  If it was not for that, Scarpetta would have clearly gotten 5 stars, as it did meet my high expectations.

The original plan for Thanksgiving dinner was to go to Caesars' Bacchanal Buffet, but since we were staying at the Cosmopolitan, the logistics of getting the family together there scrapped that Plan A.  Plan B was to go to the Cosmo's Wicked Spoon Buffet, but the three-hour plus wait resulted in us scrapping that one, too.  As a result, we made our way to Scarpetta since everyone likes Italian (right?) and they could accommodate our party of eight without reservations at 6:30 pm on Thanksgiving Day for dinner.  By this point, we were just happy that we found someplace...anyplace...for dinner.  \n\nWe were seated in a nice, small, private room looking out over the Bellagio's fountains to the north.  Matthew, our server, was exceedingly professional and knowledgeable about the menu, offering spot on food and drink recommendations.  We started off with drinks while we looked over the menu.  I had the Billionaire ($16) made with Elijah Craig, pomegranate syrup, Pernod Absinthe, and lemon juice.  Frankly, the cocktail was well made and pleasing, however, for the price, I wasn't impressed with the choice of Elijah Craig as the base spirit unless it was for their 18 or 20 year old stuff.  Of course, since they didn't specify, I assumed it was for the standard 12 year old bourbon.  For starters, the table shared an order of Crispy Fritto Misto consisting of seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon ($18) and an order of Creamy Polenta topped with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms ($17).  All elements of the fritto misto were fried to perfection, crispy, without a hint of sogginess, leaving the mix of shrimp, calamari and octopus tender.  I like polenta.  The polenta was creamy as advertised and as good a polenta as I've ever had.  That said, it was $17 for polenta...a bit pricey.  Chef Scott Conant and his Scarpetta are known for its fresh made pastas, so for my main course, I had the Pici, a thick, spaghetti-like pasta, with lobster, preserved tangerine & bottarga ($36). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=EmJ-zvY2Ihq8gwDluU6IPQ#qPDstnGpczl7IsR5MB4p5g  I'd never had pici before and it was a hearty, filling pasta.  It was tossed with restraint with what I'm assuming was only olive oil, the preserved tangerine, bottarga (a dried, pressed fish roe), and tender chunks of lobster claw meat.  The pasta dish was outstanding as the flavor profile and aromatics of each ingredient were present and in perfect balance.  While it was one seriously pricey bowl of pasta, it tasted like it was worth every bite as it hit my tongue.  The gf and I split a side of roasted mushrooms consisting of trumpet royale, beech, and shitake mushrooms, topped with pecorino and trucioleto vinegar ($11) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=EmJ-zvY2Ihq8gwDluU6IPQ#EmJ-zvY2Ihq8gwDluU6IPQ  It was a nice plate of fungus and excellent complement to my pasta. \n\nScarpetta may not have been our first choice for Thanksgiving dinner, but it was definitely a good choice.  The food was well-executed and delivered amazing flavor.  Service was attentive without any hint of intrusiveness.  The only downside was that it was quite expensive and some items seemed overpriced for what was received.  Still, Scarpetta is a fine restaurant and perfect for a special occasion...even Thanksgiving dinner."

I loved the lighting and the overall layout was quite lovely. Sitting next to the windows give you an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nWe started out with the steak tartar which was served with some parmesean chips. Delicious app that i woukd order again. Also tried that short rib on top of risotto. Really enjoyed this as well, but 180 degrees on flavor profile from tartar. So it depends what you want you want! \n\nThe duck foie gras raviloi was 100% what you would expect. Delicate ravioli, generous filling, and a whole plate. I would eat this over and over. Also ordered the Uni pasta. This was such an interesting meal. If you enjoy seafood like i do, this will leave you wanting more. Essentially tasted like ocean. And i loved it. \n\nCoconut soufle was amazing. Pour over sauce and side of toasted coconut. \n\nI suppose my only real complaint was the wine. Typical vegas fashion the wine list was okay. And i found some bottles to be so over priced. $42 for a pour of 85' dows... Thats silly.  $98 dollars for a 15-25 bottle of poggio tesoro. I am a firm believer of bringing your own wine and just paying corkage in Vegas. Wine lists in vegas casinos are so awful nowadays. \n\nId eat here again and just always bring my own wine. 2 bottle max, $35 corkage. Bubbles, extra bottle and youre set."

They have an extensive wine menu.\n\nTheir bread and their dipping sauces for it were delicious. \n\nRaw yellowtail was delicious!\n\nAlso ordered the\nTuna susci not bad but I would have ordered another raw yellow tail instead of this\nTaglitelle \nspaghetti\nStracci \n\nIf I could order one of those 3 pastas again I would pick the simple and very impressive spaghetti.  it's not just your ordinary tomato with basil spaghetti. \n\n\nThe guava sobert type of dessert was amazingly delicious!  A great surprise for the end."

The citrus olive oil was amazing paired with the Stromboli!\n\nBerry smash - this drink was very good\n\nYellowtail sashimi - 4 stars. rock salt used was unique and yellowtail was tender.  \n\nSignature Spaghetti dish -  5 stars. This dish was really incredible.  Delicious in it's simplicity.   The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce light yet flavorful.  I have not had anything like it before and I will be trying to recreate it at home.\n\nShort rib agnolotti -  5 stars. This was excellent!  It has a very strong horse radish taste so you have got to really like horse radish!  \n\nPici - 4 stars. This dish was very good.  The noodles are cooked al dente. A little too mu/ch so for my taste.  There was tons of lobster.  I enjoyed the lobster paired with the tarragon.  I do not normally like pesto but I really liked the chili pesto in this dish.  \n\nThe restaurant is very nice however we were a party of 5 and were seated right by the exit sign and bus area.  It seems this restaurant is more suited for parties of 4 our less. as there is not a lot of seating for a larger party."
