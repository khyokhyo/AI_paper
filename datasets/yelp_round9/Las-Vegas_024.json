Culinary Dropout contributes $4 to a local charity.  \n- I had: 1) Yesterday's Soup - seems similar to minestrone and I liked it since it was light. 2) Pub Burger - awesome. 3) Salted Caramel Custard - I'm not in to desert so I didn't care for the sweetness.\n- 2 of my friends enjoyed their meals (the also opted for the $20.14 special).  The 3rd friend only ordered a chicken salad and though he enjoyed it, he said the price/portion size was more akin to a side salad than a large salad entree."

Good Bar environment but for a restaurant it is super loud, service needs to improve, pricey for what you are getting...\n\nI did enjoy the Turkey Pastrami and would recommend that if you go.\n\nI will give it one more try before its either on or off the list of repeat dining recommendations.  There are so many options in Vegas."

            "review": "I would say this place is solid but not outstanding. We made a reservation however when we arrived (about 1pm on a Friday) this place was empty. We were seated promptly and were quickly greeted by our server. We started off with the pretzel and cheese fondue (thanks yelpers!) which was the best part of the meal. I had fish and chips - they were soggy but had a decent taste. My husband had a club sandwich which was meaty, a large potion but just average in taste. Our server was pretty good just a tad slow at times. \n\nThe vibe there was geared towards 20 something's which left us feeling a bit out of place. I felt I was too clean cut and clean to be here!!\n\nWe would probably not come out of our way to eat here again. Any of this food I could easily find on the strip. Then again, that pretzel shiz was pretty darn good!"

My dad did their brown bag special, which was a can of beer in a brown bag so you don't know what it is. It was something cheap, which made him laugh. He's no snob so he still drank it. I had their Riesling and my partner had the moscato, both were good. Did the pretzel bites with fondue and home made chips with french onion dip. Chips and dip were good, pretzels and fondue were amazing. I was surprised that they did provolone but it was excellent. Saw mussels, fried chicken and a few other things go out. All looked good. Ambiance is cool. Love Hard Rock, like this place too."

They were good but I would have preferred a smaller bite (hard not to double dip being that large) and not sure I fancy provolone. We asked for mustard.\nWe shared the fried chicken and the Beef Stroganoff.  The coleslaw on the chicken plate was surprisingly scrumptious. \nWe had a amazing peanut Butter & Chocolate tar with fresh cream\nOh and their Coffee (passport organic we were told) was very yummy.\n\nCool vibe, great music, great d\u00e9cor, great staff and fun place. Not sure if the food tickled my taste buds enough to return but if I had a lot of younger friends to entertain I might consider taking them there."

The build-your-own meat and cheese plate is amazing, and everything that comes out of the kitchen looks phenomenal.  The furniture inside is gorgeous and the exterior has a great campfire feeling to it.  Staff was awesome as well as amazingly helpful in recommending a good place for us to go that night to party.  I will most definitely be coming back here my next time in Vegas!"

I could drink this out of a camelback on a hike! Next, and this is over the course of my week here, I had the grapefruit vodka, fresh squeezed!  Amazing with salty rim. \n\nOkay now food here is amazing. Real food! Simple yet delectable spices. I had the \"cheap salad\" with homemade buttermilk ranch, it was refreshing and the dressing was so good I ordered mas. I got the Brussels sprouts- they were served cold and I requested hot. They came out lukewarm but flavor was like grilled heaven. Next day I got the antipasto on happy hour. Best six bucks I've ever spent. The BBQ nuts were more addictive than the slots. The mini platter also came with manchego cheese, olives, shaved ham, and more Brussels sprouts!  \n\nOkay, now for the service... Every single person I've encountered at Culinary Dropout had been awsome! They treat customers like friends and seem genuinely happy. \n\nI've got a new favorite in Vegas."

            "review": "Love, love this place! Very laid back environment. You can tell because even the employees don't have a dress code and they can wear whatever they want. The seating is comfortable with a view of the pool. We didn't get a chance to sit outside as it was 105 degrees. We were a group of three girls so it may seem like a lot of food but it was so good not to finish lol only a few Pretzel bites were spared. \nFood - Pretzel bites with cheese fondue: the first time around they didn't bring out enough cheese so we had to ask for another pot of cheese fondue. \nBBQ Pork belly nachos: De-li-ciousss! I just wish they would shred the pork instead of bigger chunks as its hard sharing with a group. \nGrilled cheese sliders - It only comes with three. Toasted, cheesy, warm, what more can u ask for? It also came with fries. \nTruffle potato chips- OMG. These are a must have every time! Try dipping them in the fondue cheese. Ah-mazing! \nDessert - We had the Bourbon Black Bottom Pie & Caramel Salted Custard. Both delicious but the custard takes the lead."

There was live music which is a nice touch and she was unique to say the least. The waitress was really nice, on point and was always around. The only con about the employees is you'll have no idea who they are since they are all dressed in street clothes. Someone  ordered the pretzel bites with fondue and everyone enjoyed them. I ordered the grilled cheese sliders (made with American cheese) and they were good if you're under 12 lol. Not what I expected for $12 but maybe I had my expectations set too high for this place. A couple of friends ordered the chicken club and it was huge, they liked it. I'll probably try this place again and order something different :)"

The copperless mules on the drink menu are a must. The chips and dip on the appetizers are a can't miss! Everything was good, even down to the perfectly roasted brussel sprouts. It's a bit on the loud side on the inside but if it's a nice day, be sure to head out to the large patio to relax with a cocktail. Good option for gluten-free diets as well."

Vegas is so full of what I call \"Las Vegas Templates\" that this was a breath of fresh air. Even though it's a cab ride off the strip, I've always found the Hard Rock Casino to be cleaner and less smokey and an awesome experience. Seeing Pete Townshend's guitar, Jimi Hendrix's coat, Paul McCartney's lyrics make hanging out a lot of fun. This restaurant had it all...a great menu where it's hard to choose, excellent beer and liquor selection and friendly & knowledgable staff. We were immediately steered towards the pretzel bites and fondue appetizer which was insanely good. I had the Korean Style Ribeye Cap that was 5 stars. Was also sold on the \"Smashed Irishman\" cocktail; Jameson Irish Whiskey, Guiness redux and mint which was phenomenal and had me ready to head to the blackjack tables, at which point, common sense luckily prevailed. I'm done giving the city of Las Vegas any more of my money, but can't say I feel the same way about Culinary Dropout. Can't wait to come back."

Well, that all changed today at Culinary Dropout inside the Hard Rock Las Vegas. \n\nFor those who have never been, don't let the name fool you. Whatever culinary school you dropped out of was probably not advanced enough to keep up with your creativity. The Korean Ribeye Steak suggested by our server Jenny was flawless. Perfectly seasoned and brilliantly executed, it left you wanting nothing. Would've posted a pic, but one bite became two, and the rest is history. \n\nFish and chips were probably some of the bat I've ever had. Extremely light batter, perfectly prepared as I've come to suspect is the norm here. Crazy good. \n\nAnd let's not for Jenny, our server for the evening. Super charming and extremely attentive, she was spot on. From the complicated beer order of my friend to the small requests of salt and pepper, she was always there a smile. The perfect server for the perfect restaurant. \n\nOne word to sum it all up, WOW."

They also have something called a paper bag special where you get a canned beer in a bag for like $2.50 and you just don't know what it is (unless you take it out of the bag, but that's spoiling it!).\n\nThe coup de grace here is the pretzels and fondue. It was absolutely amazing and I think I could eat it every day. Perfect bites of pretzels along with blazing hot cheese fondue. There is just nothing wrong to say about it.\n\nI also got a burger one of the times we were there. It was okay, altho not spectacular. I honestly barely remember it a few days later. I just keep thinking about those pretzels..."

            "review": "Is this becoming a nationwide trend? It's apparently the age of the chain gastropub. And I gotta say, I like it.\n\nCulinary Dropout is part of the Fox Restaurant Concepts conglomerate of restaurants; the original Culinary Dropout is in Fox's homebase of Scottsdale. I can haz franchising rights in Texas?\n\nI'd heard good things about Hard Rock's atmosphere, and while that mostly disappointed, Culinary Dropout was a fine time. We made reservations for 9 people on a Saturday night, which were completely unnecessary. The restaurant was about half-full, though part of the reason is it's huge with a great, casual patio.\n\nWe immediately got a free serving of Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue--delicious--a result of a duplicate order. Great start. I was mostly drawn to the impressively diverse, if pricey, beer menu. Woe is me; instead of embracing diversity, I ended up sticking to the very delicious Joseph James lager all night. There's some good stuff on there, and if you've lost all your money gambling on the tables there's also a \"paper bag special\" for $3. Our waitress described it as Bud Select or something of that ilk; we stayed away but I found it cheekily fun.\n\nMenu prices are quite reasonable after getting eye-gouged by the Vegas exchange rate. The Meatloaf--my choice, was exceptionally large and quite filling. Ends were more than a little burnt, but I enjoyed the \"meaty\" part and enjoyed the sides. The Shaved Prime Rib Dip got huge raves from our waitress, who was excellent all night, as well as my fellow diners who ordered it. The Fish & Chips and 36-Hour Pork Ribs were called as decidedly average.\n\nIt's a really great ambiance, and if the Hard Rock had more of the \"zoo\" atmosphere that I was promised, I think the night would've been even better. As it is, it's a short cab ride from the strip and was still a great time regardless."

The smoky flavor was present, but not overwhelming.  I could have had 3, except for the fact that it was pretty darn strong.  For $10 a pop, I enjoyed that it had a little kick to it.  \n\nI ordered a chicken sandwich because our waiter told us that all the bread was house made and raved about the sandwiches.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.  My two brunch partners got salad, which they said were very tasty.  \n\nIf you're staying at the Hard Rock, I'd definitely give this place a try.  It offers something a little different from the steakhouses and sushi bars."

Atmosphere is really slick. Feels like fine dining but without all the pretense that can get old after being in Vegas for a week. \n\nI would recommend sitting inside. If it's available, the tables that have the leather sofa on one side and a living-room-style padded arm chair on the other side are awesome. You can watch the guys on the line and the wait staff at the pass. Love that they're all in plain clothes and while being very professional, also, being very approachable. \n\nSo for the food...\nWe started with the Warm Pretzel fondue appetizer. HIGHLY recommend. Especially if you're going to get a burger, because you can use the leftover cheese for your fries! I ordered the Pub Burger which had bacon, havarti & BBQ sauce. SO good. Bun was so fresh and had a great crust on it. Almost like a pretzel as well, but not too hard. Cooked to a PERFECT medium. Was very pleased. Fries weren't much to get excited about, but when using that Cheese fondue, they became amazing. \nMy wife had the Beef Stroganoff. It was A+. Beef was so lean and mushrooms were delicious. I love that on the menu they straight-up say \"Frozen Peas\". HA! Again, NO pretense. \n\nFor drinks, I had a Batch 19 Pre Prohibition style lager & my wife had a Smashed Irishman cocktail that she thoroughly enjoyed. I loved that their cocktail menu had silhouette pictures of the style of cup it would come in. They are also sorted into themed pages where each offering on the page is the same price. Very handy.\n\nDidn't save room or time for desert, but the Peanut Butter Chocolate something or other will be on the menu when we make it back next vist to Las Vegas."

            "review": "I am so upset at my recent visit to your culinary dropout location here in Vegas!\nI had called around 530 to make a reservation because I had heard so many good things about your restaurant and read that you had great unique dishes! So I called and had my friend from out of town make a reservation for a party of 2 at 10 pm. I hadn't seen my friend in a while so I was really enthused to show him this amazing location inside of the Hard Rock. When we got there we were seated by someone that wasn't a host. I didn't get his name but I do remember that he walked us to our table. Before we were sat we made small talk with this gentleman and asked him if it was busy, he said that it was a slow day and then grabbed menus and walked further inside the restaurant. Halfway into the restaurant he asked us if we had preferred to sit outside and seemed very indecisive on where he was going to seat us even though there was plenty of tables with servers in their section to accommodate a measly party of 2. So he instead walked us outside where there were no tables and sat us near a fire pit. Since the outside tables weren't set up he moved a table and two chairs over from a different sections and sat us down. About 5 minutes later a server by the name of candy walked out and introduced herself. I had never been to this location so was interested in the menu, the ingredients and the favorite and best selling dishes. She said \"everything on this menu is surprisingly good\" that didn't sell me on anything so I told her that we would start off with two beers first and we would look over the appetizers. She smiled and walked into the restaurants. My friend and I started catching up and talking and within that time we noticed that she started going to other tables and putting dishes away and closing out people's tabs and completely ditching our table! Twenty minutes had gone by and I didn't get a drink and she didn't come back outside to check on our table. I was infuriated so I walked inside and looked everywhere for a manager! Everywhere I went and everyone I asked didn't seem to know where he was! So I patiently waited by the bar when suddenly candy made her way to me and said I am finally here do you want to be sat at the bar now? What can I get you? I was so mad that she hadn't even apologized or taken the amount of wasted time in to consideration. She had simply dismissed the idea that she had neglected our table and was polishing and putting things away because she wanted to close. Another 5 minutes later the general manager approached the bar and didn't introduce himself and all he said was I'm sorry that she dropped the ball I'll buy you guys drinks. His name was Danny I believe and he also didn't try to asses the situation or make it any better. 5 minutes later he had asked the bartender to give us a round of beers on the house and upon giving me my beer the server spilled the beer all over me and my belongings. So, not only did I waste my time by going to a place I thought was legit and amazing but I was sat outside at a dirty table neglected by a uninterested server and then I got a beer spilled all over me. The manager was the worst experience for me because he did ABSOLUTELY nothing to try to make the situation better. When he was talking to us he was distracted and uninterested in making things right. I am disappointed in the level of service and professionalism that this place offered and I will be telling everyone not to go there! Your company has been known to provide good services, and such events tarnish the company name, so please address this issue soon."

My brother frequents this place in Arizona, so we had some ideas about what to order. We started out with the pretzel bites with provolone cheese fondue. I highly recommend this appetizer, the only downside is that I filled up and could not finish my pub burger. The burger was exactly what I was looking for, gastropub style with lots of flavor. I was sad that I could not finish it. My GF got the breakfast burrito, which was fantastic. For drinks I had The After School Special. Thumbs up in my book. The girlfriend had the bottomless mimosas, can't go wrong there. We had our service dog with us, the staff was more than friendly with him being with us ( I know it's a law that an establishment can't discriminate, but trust me, it happens) We sat on the patio and had our drinks while watching the staff shave their Mo-vember mustaches off. Great people watching. Our waiter Shaun, was not only a great server, but a great human being. He talked with us for a long time and made us feel right at home. I really liked this place and will be back. Next time you are at Hard Rock, skip the gross restaurant Pink Taco, and head into Culinary Dropout. Look for the tattooed server named Shaun, you won't be disappointed."

Apparently, several in the group hadn't heard of CD and were putting me under the gun for my recommendation...in the end everyone gave me props.\n\nWe started with some antipasti which was all very good and if that's your thing I would recommend giving a meat, a cheese, olives, and tomatoes a whirl.  But at the very least, get yourself some of the 'crusty bread and good olive oil'  The bread was awesome and the olive oil was even better, I'd get it every time.\n\nSo many of the items on the menu sound good it was tough to decide.  The overwhelming favorite order was the Turkey Pastrami...how can you go wrong with a pretzel bun?  I was fortunate enough to convince a friend to go halfsies on the Turkey Pastrami and the Shaved Prime Rib dip.  We both agree the dip was phenom and the better of the two choice.\n\nThey have a pretty solid selection of beers and actually offer a cool deal where for $2.95 you can get a cheap as hell beer in a brown bag.  The beer was sort of a mystery and I think it changes every so often...it would even be better if it changed order to order.  This go around it was a 'Buck Range Light'.  I had never heard of it but someone at the table had.\n\nThe waiter mentioned they have some nice specials certain nights.  I think on some Sunday's they do $3 Jameson drinks and $1 oysters if you're into that.\n\nThe only thing keeping Culinary Dropout from a 5 star rating (in my opinion...obviously) are the portions.  For the prices we paid for a sandwich, I thought they could have been a little bigger.  The shave prime rib dip was amazing, but the given the size i could have had 1.5-2 easily.  For an $18 sandwich I'd hope to at least have to put up a fight to finish or feel full afterwards.  That's my only warning, otherwise, it's a pretty cool and delicious place to grab a meal.  They even feature outdoor seating for days when it isn't 115 degrees."

However the pretzels and provolone fondue will be recommended by me if ever I hear of anyone going here or if I ever come here again. My table had mixed reviews on the food. Everyone agreed on the pretzels and the burrata. The salads were only ok and the Brussels sprouts were good but not great. My friend did not like her chicken meatballs although I thought they were ok. I had the fried chicken and I was the envy of the table. It was crispy and very hot when it arrived. I thought it was good but very oily. Back to yardbird for me for fried chicken.  I would come here again and try something else.... And the pretzels."

They had fire pits on so we asked if they can turn them off and they did. They were very accommodating and friendly. We looked over the menu and placed our drink orders. There drinks are a must try. We had the el matador that was made with tequila and my wife had the original drop out. They were both under the mule section but didn't come in copper mugs. Both very tasty and refreshing. \n\nPretzel bites w/ fondue - these were very tasty. You get pretzel balls with a side of cheese fondu. Dip the pretzel in that cheese and such a great combination. Just an FYI it's a lot of pretzel so if your a party of 3-4 then this is just right. Any less then 3 it's a lot of food. \n\nFried Chicken - the fried chicken looked amazing but something about the seasoning they use on the chicken I was not a fan of. It had like a sweet element to it that I really didn't enjoy. The chicken itself once past the sling was good and juicy. The buttermilk biscuit was ok and there was a side of mash potatoes that were a little to salty and some slaw that was just ok. My wife enjoyed it so give it a try you might too. \n\nBBQ pork belly nachos - black beans, guacamole, sour cream and Pico de Gallo. On top of some crispy tortilla chips with chunks of pork belly. These were good and tasty and piel belly was very tender and good. Covered with some type of queso that tied everything together. I preferred these over the friend chicken. \n\nIf in the hard rock and looking for something to eat and grab a drink give this place a try."

I always have to get the antipasta plate.  Usually pretty consistently the same, but they switch the cheeses out or the nuts out for a different flavor.  This is my favorite meal anyway, so very happy to get it for such a great deal.\n\nAnd you'd think that since we go in for the cheap happy hour deals that the staff would be snooty...never once.\n\nOh and I forgot the fries...so good.  Actually much of their menu looks worth trying, but this stuff is so good that we don't want to try anything else.\n\nSo I am sharing my secret because they are usually a little slow...yes, we are there at their slow time, so I hope that they get enough party business to stay open....they are really good and really the menu prices are pretty decent for the location.  \n\nSo now that I wrote a review about your awesome happy hour, please do not change it :)\n\nUpdate....this is still my favorite happy hour, but we did try the fried chicken, however I am a connoisseur of fried chicken and it didn't change my world....however I wanted to tell the manager to please be sure to take off the horrible instant mashed potatoes...if they don't want to make them, serving fries is perfectly acceptable w fried chicken.  Have also tried the chicken club sandwich now and while good, it is not as good as the meatloaf sandwich.  \n\nServers are always so super nice and attentive."

I'd prefer a smaller portion with higher quality fondue.  The salmon bruschetta was akin to tuna fish smear on overly thick bread coupled with a pale out of season tomato, some capers and marinated red onion.  Poor balance on flavors to say the least.

She then provided us on options of where would we like to be seated, the bar, a table or sitting down at a table outside facing this awesome jungle style pool. I decided NOT to get my George of the jungle ON and we said by the bar. Being the cool person I am me and the lady posted up by the tvs like we had the remote control . Lol\n\nThe menu is pretty basic but offered the right options we needed to satisfy the beast. I order the Fried shrimp Caesar salad, and the breakfast burrito since it was only 11:30 AM. Boy did they both live up to my expectations! The breakfast Bburrito display much flavor and is a good size. You literally can split this with a partner or friend. The breakfast Brito also came with some crispy delicious potatoes. On the side came this delicious salsa to get my toes twinkling. The salad was very fresh and the fried shrimp was very crispy.\n\nI also tried a new IPA call Big Dog that was referred by the cool bartender with the awesome tattoos. Word-of-mouth is that Dig Dog IPA is on the rise. \n\nOur food came out extremely fast and the service promptly took care of us. Thank you for a good experience. \n\n\n If any readers try Dig Dog IPA or had tried it, please let me know what you think about it."

Culinary Dropout fits in nicely between the ultra casual Lucky's 24/7 Diner and the much higher end NOBU and 35 Steaks and Martini on the HR property. Culinary Dropout is more what I would describe as comfort food, they have a pretty decent menu that should suit most. Some freinds and I dropped in for a bite and ate outside poolside for lunch one afternoon. I went with an order of the hot pretzels with fondue dips and a turkey reuben, both were delish. Service was good too, I have no real complaints and would recommend this place to fellow Yelpers and freinds in a heart beat."

There was some initial confusion because both our drink menu and our charcuterie options were outdated, but the server handled it well and I was happy with the tasty soppresseta and cheese.  I think it is a little much to charge for bread when I am paying for both meat and cheese separately, but with a few accompaniments, we could have easily made this our meal.\nI thought the fried chicken wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either.  It came with a large biscuit, but no butter and the cole slaw was incredibly bland.  The drumstick and thigh were both juicy, but the breast was quite tough.\nWe finished with the baked-to-order apple monkey bread, which was meh.\nAll in all, this wouldn't be worth a trip to the Hard Rock, but if you were there already and hungry, you could find some decent food."

I made a reservation for 10a via Opentable. Moseyed in right as they were opening & selected a table on the cusp of inside & outside. Perfect choice! From the hostess to the random employee passing by, everyone was super friendly & chill... my brunchmate seemed memorized by them. Not really knowing what portion sizes to expect, the two of us ordered 3 items to share: Cap'n Crunch french toast, grilled cheese sliders (with fries) & (a special item) asparagus toast. As for the portions- they are more along normal sized (to some they may seem on the small side), so the 3 items for us to share were perfect. The CC french toast was cool!... I'd totally get it again & highly recommend. The grilled cheese sliders & fries were tasty & had great texture... another one I recommend! The asparagus toast should be a regular item... perhaps swapping out the asparagus with whatever is in season? To be honest, I forgot what all was on it... I saw asparagus & was sold. There was perfectly grilled asparagus, truffle oil?, these amazing crackly potatoes & two sunny side up eggs. From the sweet, salty & texture perspectives, we were thoroughly satisfied! By the time we left, the place was full... reservations are definitely the way to go. I'm looking forward to going back again for brunch, but also checking it out for dinner!"

The bartender was really nice and friendly. The happy hour deals are great. $3 for draft beer. And an assortment of half-off menu items - chips and dip, fries, grilled cheese sliders, etc. I went with the chips and onion dip. The portion was plentiful. The chips were large and just the right level of thickness and crispness. The dip was creamy and tasty and not overly onion-y. Based on my limited experience here, I would most definitely return."

The chairs and  tables have almost a rustic / disheveled look to them. each table has their own set of seat backs and seats that don't match the others. There are large glass chandeliers hanging above the larger tables, and I counted 3 small fire pits on the patio. There is also a full service bar to the right of the dining room.\n\nI was offered a seat at the bar, but requested a table in the dining area. After being seated a waitress by the name of Rae (I hope I remember correctly) approached, greeted, and sat down at the table to discuss the menu (since it was my first visit.)\n\nThis is the type of hospitality and customer service that I really look for in a restaurant. After explaining what she liked and helping me through some of the things I fancied, we both decided that she would just bring some food and I would eat. When the food arrived it was just simple food on a plate. no pretentious arrangements, no rediculous garnish, that's not intended to be eaten, just good food prepared well.\n\nHer attentiveness is really what made the experience for me. Super down to earth/chill people, showing that you actually care for guests is what sets this place apart.\n\nAfter paying the bill I was even give a to-go beverage, when again, I didn't ask for or expect, but it was the thought that counted.\n\nI would highly recommend this place, especially during happy hour."

Yes folks, you read that right - a turkey pastrami sandwich and it's to die for.  You know how all the buzz in the sandwich world right now is the pretzel bun?  And it seems like an awesome concept until you find yourself gnawing on a dry, dense piece of dull bread with a shiny pretzel finish?  Well, Culinary Dropout actually succeeds with the pretzel bun.  I love that bun so much I just might marry it.  I'm sick of being single anyway.  \n\nThere's also a lovely slaw that drips from the sandwich that I found so tasty, I began scooping up the drippings with my fries.  \n\nI also tried their roasted beets (SO GOOD) and their deviled eggs.  Culinary Dropout has managed the impossible - they've made deviled eggs sexy.  \n\nTheir only downfall is their location - ugh, the Hard Rock.  So many drunk twentysomethings in bedazzled t-shirts!

Okay we ordered. Half way through eating she comes back to ask about our dessert order. Uh, yeah we are still working on our dinner- we state we have not looked yet. The restaurant was not full and they were not busy. Comes back again while we are still eating to ask again about dessert, we say no thanks. She the brings the check while we are still eating dinner. WTF. I ask for more water and she asks \"Sure, do you want it in a to go cup?\" Are you kidding me. I can almost understand if they were packed and people were waiting to get in.

            "review": "so, we were here about a month ago and had probably one of the worst experiences at any restaurant. However, we came back and had a much better experience. \n\nFirst of all, we like to thank Mike for inviting us back so we can give this new place a second chance. Secondly, thank you to Alyssa and Erica for making our experience that much better than the first.\n\nAlyssa really knew her food knowledge and was really great at checking up on us. Erica came back several times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and even the food runners knew where to drop off food, which was a challenge for them the last time we were here. Overall, we had a great time and are definitely making this place a go to spot.\n\nNow, on to more important business, the food. Here's the break down:\n\n1st course: Pretzel and cheese fondue and burrata. You can't go wrong with cheese and pretzels, especially when its fondue. Warm pretzel and cheese, definitely a plus. This app is also great for sharing if you're here with a big group. Burrata, OMG! We've had burrata served all sorts of way but it's definitely the best here. Served with toasty bread and chimichurri, what a combination. It's a little sweet and salty and the burrata adds this creamy and cool element, you have to try this when you're here. This is the perfect deconstruction of a caprese salad.\n\n2nd course: Rainbow trout and the Ribeye cap. Rainbow trouts don't  get enough credits if you ask me. This mild white fish is perfect for grilling and pairing with some intense flavors. Here, it is served with some green beans and toasted almonds. The flavor of the fish gets a chance to be the star because the other elements are soft and enhances the flavor instead of overpowering it. But, the star of this course is the Ribeye cap. It was so tendered and all the flavors were wonderful. Asian inspired so you get a little spicy, a little sweet and a little salty. They're already sliced so consuming them was that much easier. If you're a cilantro (coriander), ask for extra. The flavor adds a little bitterness that goes really well with it.\n\n3rd course: Monkey Bread. You all know that I love a good dessert. And this time, we didn't run out of time. It's baked to order so give it a little time to get to your table. It's piping hot when it arrives and you have to eat this with your hands. You pull apart these tiny brioche that is soaked in cinnamon and sugar. It was good. Its a good pull a part version of a cinnamon bun. It was a little too sweet for me so luckily I had some pretty strong coffee to sip on.\n\nCiao and until next time, happy eating everyone :)"

This place definitely has a rustic chicness with a slight rebellious energy. I love the chandeliers and the green vintage couches. A drop-down garage door opens up to the outdoor patio and the iconic Hard Rock pool. There's also a 12-seat raw bar and a full antipasti bar if you're feeling the urge. \n\nI went with the wildly popular soft pretzels with provolone fondue.  So delicious! The soft pretzels come with sea salt and are so warm and pillowy. The fondue sauce was wonderful with a nice sharp bite and a creamy irresistible texture. Nothing like dunkin' fresh-baked pretzel bites into a pot of creamy fondue. Real crowd pleaser! \n\nReconnect with your inner child and go with the Cap'n Crunch French Toast. Dusted with powdered sugar and fresh raspberries and drizzled with a lovely custard sauce. The flavors meld together so well. This French toast has it all! \n\nThe menu offers up such a variety with fried chicken, king crab legs, salmon, oysters, grilled cheese sliders, jambalaya, 36-hour pork ribs, pork belly cubano, cheese plates, Korean rib eye cab and monkey bread...just to name a few.\n\nCulinary Dropout is proving to be a heavyweight in the Hard Rock world, joining the likes of Nobu, Pink Taco and 35 Steaks & Martinis. This place is a great hangout spot with screens, libations, fun appetizers and dishes and a prime pool-side locale. \n\nHighly recommend!"

Dare I say that CD does not match any preconceived connotations, but instead take it to a new level. \n\nI had ordered the Fish 'n Chips ($19) and it was worth the casino price. With two other English Pubs nearby, I prefer this version. The cod has a lighter batter which is spiked with heat. Although the setting is dark, the crispy exterior looked to be tinted in red. A taste of Tabasco laces the shell and lends an enjoyable characteristic profile. The side of coleslaw was also unique with a hint of citrus. I finished that first. \n\nAs for desserts, it should not be passed upon. The peanut butter chocolate pie is better than the traditional banoffee pie. This declaration is not meant to undermine the deliciousness of the latter. I could devour a whole pie of either, but the chocolate version will always be first choice. \n\nThe casual nature of the establishment makes me like it more. The dark tones and rich decor had me lounging in the banquette. I am also rather jealous of the staff. They are able to dress in their own attire. Although a neat concept, it makes distinguishing them rather difficult."

No taste complaints, but the 'buttermilk ranch' was not really evident.\n\nDrinks: Between You & Me: Belvedere, grapefruit, cranberry, and lemon.  Very refreshing and a little tarte.  Enjoyed.

I didn't care about this too much because it was always covered by the comp, but when I compare the value and quality of what I can get here with what I can get elsewhere, it just doesn't make sense.\n\nAs to the actual quality of the food, some of it is OK.  The grizzini (breadsticks) are pretty good, and I recall the ribs being decent.  Every steak I've had here has been awful though.  I've gotten both the korean rib cap and the steak with the dolce gorgonzola.  Both are pre-cut, usually fatty or gristly, and very small portions.  Maybe 6-8 ounces or something like that.  Service here has always been a bit slow, even though they are never busy when I go by (usually around noon on a weekday).  If you sit at the bar at least your drink service will be a bit better, but food still takes a while to come out.\n\nOn my most recent visit I went with my girlfriend and we were seated quickly near the only other two occupied tables in the restaurant.  Several servers/waiters came by but never stopped to even ask for our drink orders.  One server walked past us briskly without stopping and greeted us, but that was all!  And it's not like I have a bad rep here -- I order simply and always tip.  The girl at the front even knows I usually choose to sit at the bar.  After at least 5 minutes we got up and left, giving our menus to the girl at the front and told her what happened.  She went off to yell at the waiters and we went next door to Mr .Lucky's.\n\nLet me tell you, Mr. Lucky's is amazing compared to this place.  Most casino's 24 hour cafe style restaurants are pretty normal but they really do have great food here.  The prices look a tad steep, but the quality/portions are great.  One of the best casino cafe burgers, definitely the best casino cafe chicken fingers, the short stack of pancakes is great, and the steak & eggs is the best I've ever had (yes even better than the vaunted Ellis Island's).\n\nSo, long story short, screw you Culinary Dropout.  Your food ranges from average to plain awful, and your service is the pits."

Unfortunately we were still full from lunch, so we didn't get to eat as much as we would have liked, so I'll review based on what we did have...\nOur server was great. She was super helpful, and helped us decide on cocktails, which were awesome. My husband had the Bells n Whistles, a spicy whiskey cocktail (don't order if you don't like spicy!) and I ordered a sparkling strawberry gin martini (can't remember the name but it was delicious!) We ordered the pretzel bites with fondue and the burrata (yeah, we like cheese, what about it?). The pretzel bites were...ok. A little less than warm for my liking. The cheese sauce (more sauce than fondue) was yummy. The burrata was OMG. I would definitely get it again. It was served with compressed pears, bacon syrup, walnuts, and greens, and the flavors and textures were all perfect together. \nLike I said, by this point we were already full so we called it a night, but we definitely plan on coming back again and again until we have tried all the yummy things on the menu!"

The $12 pretzel bread with provolone fondue was heavenly (I would have preferred cinnamon sugar as a dip, or maybe in addition to the fondu, but that's being too critical maybe). For entree, I ordered the vegetable chopped salad. It came out looking delicious, but it was totally bland (maybe a different dressing would have helped?). The pretzel bread was this place's saving grace. The bill was $50 for waters, two entrees (burger and salad) and the pretzel bread. Waaaay overpriced for a pub. I will not be going back."

Oh Culinary Dropout you are bad, very very bad!!! I was staying at the HRH on business and happened to stumble on this place and I'm so glad I did. I don't know if it was one too many vodka whatevers but everything tasted so good. Culinary Dropout you had me at provolone fondu! We started with pretzel and the very good cheese fondu and went to appetizer heaven from there. Next was fries and the homemade chips. Fried were perfectly crisp and the dip for the crunchy potato chips was definitely craveable. Next king crab legs, dozen oysters and huge monster shrimp. The oysters were beyond fresh, I mean it was like someone just dove into the ocean shucked them and brought them to us. Not to big but perfect to enjoy. The crab legs were obese with meat and equally fresh and good. The shrimp were so big that one was equivalent to other restaurants cocktail. Again equally fresh and so yummy. Next not the table was fresh French fries. I know what your thinking, Felicia, you already mentioned you had fries. Well guess what we ordered more!! Pigs, we were pigs!! Lastly, the monkey bread and vanilla bean ice cream. Words cannot do justice to this gooey, cinnamony, pillowy soft pull apart desert demon!! The ice cream was just icing. We didn't even get to any of the main courses so I will definitely be back but it will be so very hard not to order the exact same things. Service was awesome but to be honest the server could have slapped me and I would not have noticed with all of the goods!! You make me proud Culinary Dropout. Oh just in case you were wondering this place is way casual so don't worry about dressing up too much. Enjoy!"

Boy was I disappointed! \n\nFirst of all, the meats/cheese board is ridiculously overpriced. We ordered a few different types of  cheese and meat ($7 each, $5 each) and the portions were incredibly tiny. I asked the waiter \"Is this it?\" and come to find out, each portion is only 1.5 oz. You gotta be kidding me !! $5 or $7 dollars for 1.5 oz of meat or cheese is just ridiculous. I get that this is Vegas, but the meat/cheese wasn't special at all.\n\nSecond, the sandwich (Chicken Club) was good, but nothing to write home about. $14 dollars is fairly comparable to what I would pay at home, so I have no complaints about price on that.\n\nThe best thing was the pretzel and cheese dip. I would come back just for that dip plus a drink.\n\nAs far as beer list, 20oz Ninkasi tricerahops was $10! WHAAAA? Most cocktails priced at $12, so go for a cocktail if you come here.\n\nAlso, who decided that it was a good idea to skip adding a bathroom and use the preexisting bathroom  on the casino floor?"

The best way I can describe it is as a classy Cracker Barrel -- but that's way underestimating it's goodness. The cocktails, mostly bourbon based, are homemade and distinct, and I particularly loved the bourbon with papaya juice, jalapeno and bitters. I am a southerner, so I'm a sucker for great fried chicken. I was told that I had to try it here, and I was not disappointed. The buttermilk crust was crunchy, thick and perfectly browned, and the meat very succulent and juicy. The fried chicken entree came with a very hefty 3 pieces, all sprinkled with honey. I would put it in my top 5 fried chicken list. I also enjoyed the French onion soup, though the very large piece crouton...really a slice of bread ... was a bit much for this low carb eater. The service was very friendly and attentive, and we had a great time. For those who prefer other things than fried chicken, the rest of the menu had very attractive comfort food options that ranged from fish, to meatloaf to chicken.

They had a live musician up on stange playing guitar and singing, he was really talented and was taking requests, it was a nice addition to the atmosphere.\n\nWe weren't hungry enough to order a whole meal because we'd eaten at a buffet earlier in the day so we ordered draft beers ($3.50 special) and their specialty - the soft pretzels with provolone fondue ($12). TO DIE FOR!\n\nThe service was good - our waiter was patient and attentive. We can't wait to return."

We had the jambalaya, beef stroganoff, chicken curry, fish and chips & a side of bread. \nOur friend ordered a salad & it came with no croutons....he needed carb crunch in his life. He asked our waitress and they made him fresh croutons. It did take a long minute BUT well worth the wait....THEY WERE YUMMY!!! Yup we all had to try one. We were all happy with our food. The chicken curry came with this magnificent sauce so that's when we ordered a side of bread to dip with.... DELISH!!! \nI would highly recommend the curry chicken I think that was the best plate of the evening & don't forget the bread.\nThere is indoor & outdoor seating and we loved the decor. Our waitress was sweet but a little slow. I do feel the place was a bit pricey for what you get.\nOverall I would give this place a 3.5 but cant figure out how to do 1/2 a star! lol"

We stumbled upon Culinary Dropout.  The place looks really cool, and as we walked in we could hear live jazz music playing.  As we walked into the dimly lit restaurant, we could see that there were plenty of tables, inside and out, and there was a cute little oyster bar on one side.  Although there were a ton of open tables closer to the action (music, bar, etc), we were seated in a back corner by another entrance.  It was dark in there, we couldn't tell who the servers were, and it took a while before anyone approached us for drink orders.  I tried to remain calm, since I was starting to get hangry.  \nFinally a friendly young gentleman approached our table and took our drink orders.  Overall, everything was pretty slow here.  Our drinks took a while to come out, it took a while to give our server the food orders, and it took a long while for our food to finally come out.  It was a little disconcerting, since it wasn't busy in the restaurant at all.  I usually give free passes when the place is swarming with people and the servers are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  \n\nOn to the food, I had the Prime Rib Dip.  It was ok, nothing mind-blowing.  The meat was tender, but tasted slightly over-seasoned, and the au jus was bland.  Weird combination, but I guess it balanced itself out.  My friend had the steamed mussels, and those were actually very good.  The flavor was really good, and the broth was sweet.  It was also a very nice portion.  I also got to try my boyfriend's entr\u00e9e, he had the meatloaf.  It looked like homemade meatloaf covered in ketchup or some kind of red sauce.  It was a bit on the dry side, but the sauce helped.  \n\nOverall, the food wasn't anything memorable and I probably wouldn't go out of my way the next time I'm in Vegas to eat here.  It was convenient, since we were staying in the hotel, but by no means was it a quick meal."

Awesome decor/ambiance, plenty of room for large parties, live music, and Ben (our server) was super nice. \n\nWe were starving and got 2 appetizers that came out very quickly. The Pretzel bites were yummy, but the portion was way too large for 2 people. It's too bad they don't have 2 sizes & prices to choose from. Their profit margin on this item is crazy. Anyway, the Deviled eggs were the highlight of the whole meal since it was made with truffle oil. If you add that to anything, I guess it would be delicious in my opinion. ;)\n\nAnyway, we decided to try the Ribs as an entree since the description was so enticing as well as Ben recommended it. Being from the South, we definitely had very high expectations. Unfortunately, instead of being marinated for 36 hours in a great sauce, it tasted like a it was locked in the Salt Mines for days. I had 1 rib and couldn't eat anymore cause it required a glass of water to cure my thirst after that bite. It was really disappointing. I would have thought that they would have taken it off the bill and the manager came by, but was so awkward and didn't even acknowledge anything. \n\nThe dinner started off so good and ended so strangely. It is a \"hip/trendy\" place and maybe we'll come back, but it could just be for drinks/patio in the future. Let's see. Hopefully, it gets better as the comments come rolling in."

Me and some friend decided to go for dinner and grab some drinks and food. We of coursed started with the pretzels and fondue and some drinks. We each ordered our own drinks and passed around. We order the Moscato, Room Service, and After School Special to start. I was the lucky one to order the Room Service. It has gin, strawberry simple, lemon, and sparkling wine in it and I usually have other liquors, but it was served up and it was delicious. We then ordered our food. I ordered the fried chicken, which came with a biscuit, mashed potatoes, and slaw. It came with 3 pieces which was more than enough but it just wasn't very seasoned. It was just okay. Allyface ordered steak which I thought was a little cold and Niy Niy ordered the shrimp and pork belly ramen. I think his was the best bowl at the table. We also ordered another round of drinks. Next order was another after school special, between you and me, and pinot grigio. I wasn't too thrilled with the between you and me. The belvedere and grapefruit just didn't do it for me. As far as service they were great. We came in and were brought out water before we even started ordering. Our waiter was helpful with the selections as far as drinks and choosing between some menu items. I just wasn't impressed. I mean it was good but it wasn't worth the $150. I still want to go back and try the captain crunch french toast, that may win me over... we shall see."

We first tried the Burrata, a cream infuse mozzarella with persimmon, brussels sprouts, hazelnuts, and grilled croutons. As if fresh mozzarella isn't creamy enough, this just melted in your mouth. The roasted hazelnuts and crispy brussels sprouts leaves brought a delightful texture to the party in my mouth.  Our second appetizer was their infamous  soft pretzels and provolone fondue.  Delicious is an understatement.  The pretzel knobs were soft and airy on the inside, with a soft, chewy, shimmery outside. And the fondue...OH THE FONDUE... The provolone fondue to the pretzel is like a micro fleece blanket and a wood fire to you and I.  Let's just say I'm on a mission to replicate the recipe.  For entree's, we ordered the goulash and jambalaya.  Sounds ordinary, but Culinary Dropout took it to the extraordinary.  The spices were BAM! spot on.  The portions, well worth it.  Who knew leftover jambalaya would be so good for breakfast?!  I do now. We ended the meal sharing the chocolate and peanut brittle tart, a rich chocolate gonosh in a flaky crust sprinkled with peanut brittle.  Delicious.\n\nWe will definitely find ourselves back there to  try other items on the menu and more pretzels and fondue.  Cannot wait."

The 4-star Yelp reviews and clever restaurant name is what sold me. Since I was dining with my imaginary friends, we headed over to the bar area to cause a ruckus. I ordered the Turkey Pastrami sandwich w/ side salad, based on the bartender's recommendation. \n\nAs I was waiting, I people watched the hordes of tatted up, juiceheads and guidos running around half naked .My in-dining entertainment, included a patron who lined up a shot of vodka, the $4 pineapple mind eraser special, a Pabst Blue Ribbon, and a glass of wine and pounded all 4 drinks within a minute. Super classy.\n\nThe food arrived fairly quickly. The sandwich was served with a warm pretzel roll, with generous slices of turkey pastrami, swiss cheese, and smothered with cole slaw.  The sandwich was okay. Pretty messy to eat and it didn't have a wow-factor. The salad was just average too. Chilled romaine lettuce, bits of cucumber, and covered with a watery buttermilk ranch dressing. The menu, including water, came out to be a whoppin' $18 dollars with tip. \n\nThe bartenders were friendly and was very prompted in serving us. I took a look at the drink menu prices, and we took our party elsewhere. \n\nA little about my credentials:\nI first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world."

I'm certainly glad I did!\n\nWhen you check into the hostess stand, you think this place is pretty small.  Don't be fooled by that.  It's HUGE inside.  A lot of seating inside and outside as well.  Huge bar area extending outside as well.  The outside area has a bunch of lounge tables.  Our table was half chairs and half booth.  Accommodated all people of my party.  Our server was nice, seemed a bit flustered as we did have a lot of questions and most of our drink requests were \"out of stock\" which didn't make too much sense.  \n\nTheir menu is not too pricey.  Things go for $15-$30 depending on what you want.  On top of that, they have an AWESOME secret menu given out on concert days.  Since the Prince concert was there, they offered it to us!  Super fast and easy, it's only $25 dollars and comes with 3 main components:  starter salad OR soft pretzel, meatloaf OR fried chicken and a bag beer.  GREAT DEAL, by the way.  I chose the salad which was light a refreshing.  Spring mix with balsamic vinaigrette.  For the main course I got the fried chicken.  You get various dark and white meat pieces.  They gave a ton of that!  It was accompanied with mashed potatoes and gravy, sauteed green beans and a biscuit.  The chicken was super juicy and crispy on the outside!  The gravy really made the mashed potatoes, which were also very creamy.  The beans were sauteed with bacon and had a nice, light salty taste.  The biscuit also was dense and flaky with creamy butter.  SOOOOO GOOD!!  The beer was a low end beer, always different.  I got the Milwaukee's best.  The thing that enhances the experience is the paper bag it comes in.  Super creative for higher end restaurant.  Shows the lighter side of \"Las Vegas strip\" type restaurant.  I REALLY liked that :)\n\nDefinitely will be back for another try.  I would like to try their fish and chips, Korean style ribeye cap and salmon.  So many yummy toppings!  If you're in the Hard Rock hotel, I highly recommend this place before a concert, show, or date night!"

            "review": "This place was a joke.  Talk about trying way to hard to be what some 55 year old guy in Scottsdale thinks is \"cool\" these days...\n\nThis is Urban Outfitters in restaurant form, which might be forgivable if the food was any good or the menu cohesive.  For a \"gastropub\", the beer list was pretty pedestrian and the beer menu was inanely laid out.  The menu was all about clever, pseudo-hipster layout and not at all about conveying information about the beers.  On tap they have Lagunitas, but which Lagunitas?  They make several different brews.\n\nThe food was again trying way too hard to be trendy.  Unfortunately the gastropub trend jumped the shark 5 years ago, as evidenced by this pre-packaged chain restaurant.  In fact I think that this incarnation of a gastropub, cooked up by some restaurant company in that culinary mecca (and launching pad of a dozen chain restaurant monstrosities) of Scottsdale, AZ, may be the ultimate and final indicator of the gastropub shark jump.\n\nThe douchey beats from the pool outside pound through the restaurant and are beyond annoying.  The pretzels were stale and the cheese sauce they came with was grainy with too much flour in the bechamel.  The chicken curry was laughably bland with a couple of strands of dried up chicken breast and no rice (i took this one to go.)\n\nThis place is so derivative and contrived.  Simon Kitchen, First Food, and Society are already doing the comfort-retro food much better and don't need to package their menus in some goofy, obvious appeal to a specific demographic (except for First, which is itself an overly-conceived douchatoreum, but with slightly better food than CD).\n\nThe funny thing is that they are obviously trying to appeal to Brooklyn-hipster types, the exact people who wouldn't be caught dead in the HRH, let alone this charicature of a restaurant.\n\nOne extra star for the cool couches."

            "review": "A few friends came in town last night who were staying at the Hard Rock so I immediately said, let's try Culinary Dropout. I had heard so many things about this place that I thought it would be great. Maybe I had too many expectations but then again, it is the Strip so I should have high expectations. \n\nI got there a little bit before my friends and thought I would stop by the bar and grab a drink. I asked for a Menu and was only given the dinner menu. It was 5:30 and I had thought there was a Happy Hour but of course, that wasn't mentioned AT ALL since we all know the only important thing is to rip off tourists. Nice job there bartender chic. Now that I'm sitting at home, I check your website and find out that yeah, you kinda ripped me off. Nice. To add insult to injury the drink I did order wasn't what was on the menu. Yes she said that they were out of one of the ingredients, but I really question WHY? This is Las Vegas. THIS IS THE STRIP. You shouldn't be \"out\" of anything. \n\nMy friends get there and we are seated outside, which was kinda nice. It was a pretty night in Las Vegas so it was nice to enjoy the weather and chat. Someone comes over and drops off what looks a lot like a sushi menu, but it was for their antipasti and appetizers. No one really said anything about it, because you know, it's normal to get a sheet of paper and a pencil to order your food??? My friend order some asparagus, which btw, never came. Let me point out that we ordered that and drinks then waited a little bit to order food, so how asparagus can't make it to the table is a bit confusing to me. \n\nI must remark on the server. Seriously hipster dude comes over and does the lame, \"Have you been here before.\" Servers need to stop that. Especially at Strip restaurants since well, IT'S A TOURIST SPOT. Unless you are going to conduct a game show to enable food ordering, I'm pretty sure I don't need this lame spiel about your restaurant and menu. I can read English and have never had a major mishap ordering dinner before. I know. Amazing as that sounds. I also don't need this dude to tell me how they were rated a top new restaurant by US Weekly or some such nonsense. If the food and restaurant are great then I'll know that when I leave. Let it stand on its own merits not some pseudo hype that you want to use to \"impress\" us silly tourists. \n\nWe ordered our food and enjoyed conversation. It took a little longer than I would expected for fried food and a salad in a not-at-all full restaurant. My salad was good but it wasn't anything that jumped out in my mind. My girlfriend got the fried chicken. She said it was ok. Seeing that we're from Mississippi, we kinda know our fried chicken. She also commented on how it was WAY too sweet as well as the cornbread was WAY too sweet. Not shocking. This place is like all these other \"trendy\" restaurant popping up that have \"Southern\" food on their menu that they charge way too much for. They have no one in the back who can find the South on a map, let alone know how to cook food properly. They've just watched one too many episodes of Paula Dean and now think they now. Meh\n\nWe got our bill and handed the server my debit card and told him that I had the ONE drink and ONE salad. The rest was to be taken from the Hundred that my friends handed him. SEVERAL SEVERAL SEVERAL minutes later he comes back and asks them if they needed change. WHAT?!?! Just run my card and bring it as well as their change back and let them look it over. My friend replies, \"Well I don't even know how much it was since you needed to run her card.\" He IMMEDIATELY tells (not bring a check or anything) her the total and then just kinda stands there. It was a weird, and unnecessary, few moments. My friend replies, \"No just keep the change but bring her her credit card.\" He quickly runs over and runs my card and brings my receipt.\n\nThat is a tacky and pushy way to get your tip dude. Seriously. I can't believe that a server would ever do that to someone. I've worked in plenty of restaurants and a few here in Las Vegas and the only time I would say anything to that affect is if I had just that second picked up the check, not when  I've walked away and made calculations that amount to me assuming I deserve what's left over. It was a HUGE turn off on top of many turn offs. \n\nAll in all I was very under impressed after all the hype I'd heard. I see absolutely no reason to ever go back there again. I definitely won't be recommending it and I have friends come in town ALL THE TIME. I'd give it one star but the atmosphere was kinda nice and I liked the patio. Though neither of those were great enough to get to go have mediocre food and get ripped off on drinks. I hope everyone else has a better experience than I do. For me I can think of dozens of restaurants in Las Vegas I'd rather go to. Heck, I would have been MUCH happier at Firefly down the road. Sigh...lesson learned"

Two of them did not favor one of the brews offered but respected all dishes in the pairing.\n\nAlthough not a proclaimed \"foodie\" myself, it is noteworthy to report that each pairing was appreciated by all served. One woman and a visiting chef (noted above) found the Apricot Hefeweizen not to their liking while my opinion was that of great balanced and a welcome pairing choice.\n\nNot a favorite, but the Starter (Antipasti paired with the Apricot Hefe) was a good effort and primer for the main dishes. \n\nPoussin paired with Scottish Ale (2nd course) did the trick and was followed up by Double Bock Braised Short Ribs paired with a Devastator Double Bock - wonderful!\n\nThe S'Mores Tart was stellar. Eager to dig in I snapped a picture after already enjoying two bites. The Outer Darkness Imperial Stout made for a wise pairing for this tart.\n\nDespite almost all pairing seats being occupied, service was top-notch. Timing between pairings was relaxed and each dish/brew was served as if you were a VIP.\n\n\nCongrats to Tony, Ben and Chef Mike - I'll be back!"

The servers all look like they were bussed in from Williamsburg.  But, my only focus was the outdoor seating.\n\nIt's glorious, by the way. Comfy banquettes, outdoor bar, poolside, and firepits. Fire!\n\nOh, anyways, the food. \n\nI chose the carrot-ginger soup, fried chicken, and chocolate tart options from the RW menu.   My table also went for the pretzel and cheese fondue appetizer.  \n\nThe pretzel fondue was really great.  The pretzels were soft and chewy and the cheese was delicious, although a little clumpy.  I do wish they served the cheese a little hotter.  Overall, a great appetizer.\n\nMy first course, the carrot-ginger soup, was really flavorful.  I couldn't eat it all so I asked for a box.  Instead of boxing my leftovers, they gave me a whole new soup!  \n\nThe second course, the fried chicken, was pretty good.  There were three huge pieces and each was moist on the inside, crunchy on the outside.  Unfortunately, the chicken was bit too salty for me, but the batter definitely had a great flavor.   The dish also came with a tasty honey biscuit, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  I really enjoyed the coleslaw because it wasn't caked in dressing. \n\nMy favorite part of the meal was probably the toffee chocolate tart.  I've been on a tart kick lately and this one was the best of the batch.  The chocolate was dark and rich but not too sweet.  A great way to end the meal.\n\nOur server, Thanon (sp? Sorry!), was the nicest server I've had in a long time.  He went out of his way to make our meal amazing. He even offered to box up my leftover Sazerac! Who does that?!?! I would go back just for the service, it was that good.\n\nThe food, overall, is probably a 3 star experience, but the service and ambiance deserve extra stars.  I'll go back for sure!"

The food was 4.5-5 star quality. We got the jambalaya split, but really it was enough food for one. And the pretzels which are just enough to split. I highly recommend both choices they were delicious. Our server was great as well. I already am planning my next trip back for drinks and to try the raw bar"

Interesting menu with astonishing variety, quality ingredients and genuinely creative approach. My table shared the mussels and burrata pear thingy for apps, then I had the chicken curry while others had the ribs, the burger and the ribeye. Everything was great, and no pricier than any other gastropub in a Strip hotel. \n\nThe atmosphere is a bit on the douchey side. It's REALLY loud, and opens out onto the epicenter of the douchiverse, the Hard Rock pool. The waitstaff are all waaaay too cool for school; apparently, the shtick is that there are no uniforms; they can wear whatever they want..which means trendy-slutty apres-pool attire for the ladies, and hipster-douche chic for the dudes. The service was OK; it was really busy (right before the Def Leppard show) so I'll cut 'em some slack for the lackluster nature.\n\nI'd come here again, but on a slow night. I like to TALK over my meals, and it was just too freaking loud."

Their bar/beer draft selection is also pretty plentiful with PBR, Fat Tire and more.  I had the meatloaf which was recommended by a couple Yelpers - not a bad choice as it was of a pretty good size but not the best.  Some of my coworkers had the burgers which were fantastic according to them.  The cannelloi was also supposed to be pretty good but be warned, it was pretty small and not filling.  \n\nThere was also a pretty good live musician playing on the front stage - the poor guy was playing to a 1/2-empty restaurant on a Sunday night but hey, still did a good job playing in general.  \n\nThe aesthetic was pretty nice with a full bar and bar seating, some nice tables and some other seats scattered about.  Don't expect for quiet conversation inside as the music is put up pretty loud.  There were also some cool fire pits right outside - wasn't sure if it was part of the restaurant but seemed nice if you wanted to go outside or have a nice moment with your significant other.  \n\nCulinary Dropout wasn't completely wow-worthy but all-around was a strong restaurant in it's food, aesthetics and cool little bonuses.

No, really, you HAVE to start with the pretzels and fondue. If you set foot in here and you don't get the pretzels and fondue, you are messing up. The pretzels are literally the best I've ever eaten - soft, airy and pillow-light.\n\nAnother essential bar bite on the menu is the chips and French onion dip, freshly made and delicious.\n\nAs for the entrees, I've stuck to the sandwiches and burgers for the most part, and I've never been disappointed. The shaved French rib dip on a soft brioche roll is exceptional. The turkey pastrami is zesty, flavorful and balanced (although the pretzel roll, while delicious, may be redundant if you've had the pretzels as a starter.)\n\nBesides the regular menu, Culinary Dropout occasionally features beer tasting dinners. We attended one that paired a five-course menu with beers from local brewer Joseph James, who had representatives dining with us and explaining the brewing process behind each of their varieties. Seeing what Culinary Dropout's chefs can do with a little creative freedom cemented this as one of our favorite restaurants in all of Vegas.\n\nPatio seating, along the Hard Rock pool, is amazing if the weather permits and the pool isn't full of d-bags."

We ordered pretzels with fondue cheese...which to me, was microwaved pretzel bites not cooked fully and some packaged cheese dip thrown over a candle. My wife had fried chicken which somehow got cooked in less than 5 minutes and was terrible, she barely even touched the food. The skin was soggy and gross, the meat was dry and had no flavor...worst of all it cost $22! I had a shaved prime rib dip that had a ton of fat with no flavor. I'm not sure how they justify $18 for this sandwich or the crazy prizes for anything else on their menu. \n\nCulinary Dropout has pretty much everything going for it besides just one thing...good food. If it weren't for our waitress, I probably would have given this place 1 star. There was just nothing good about it. We wanted to try the monkey bread so bad but I really didn't feel like throwing away another $10 here!"

            "review": "Had dinner here last time I stayed at the Hard Rock and had a great time. I really liked the seating area and how it was laid out. Big open area with large tables for groups and small intimate tables on the outer edges for the one on one dates. Bar seating is also available and is pretty lively. I saw a little stage set up for a small band - looked cool.\n\nOk now for the best part - FOOOOD! So many things looked good on the menu. I ultimately went for the nachos. I am a sucker for nachos if they are described as loaded with toppings - yes pork belly was a eye catcher. While in the midst of getting my drank on it was a wise choice. Well they came thru - the nachos were excellent. Loaded with slow BBQ pork, black beans, guac, pico and a pretty interesting cheese sauce. The plate was large too - totally a entree on its own. Very flavorful and evenly mixed toppings, I wasn't left with a pile of chips after. \n\nI was also eyeing the fried chicken, it was touted as a restaurant fav. Luckily it was ordered at our table too and I was able to get a bite. Woah yes this was very good too. Again no shortage on flavor. Seemed pressure cooked with a crunch. Huge sized pieces along with mashed potatoes and gravy and coleslaw. A real BBQ picnic style plate here. A bit greasy but it is fried chicken after all. The meat is really tender and savory. A biscuit was also brought along side and that even was down right good. \n\nOh and a friend ordered the roasted brussels sprouts. Ehh I wasn't looking for this tonight but glad I gave them a try. They would probably make someone who didn't like brussels sprouts actually like them. They were really good.\n\nI was completely stuffed by the end of the meal and as far as I am concerned they nailed it with the nachos and fried chicken. Our waitress was great and took good care of our group. If I stay at the Hard Rock I will definitely eat here again."

We went on a Sunday night in early March, and it wasn't busy, but with warm weather on the way I expect that will change.\n\nThe beer selection is pretty good, featuring local brewery Joseph James even.  We started with a dozen oysters from their Raw Bar, which didn't last long with our group.  I don't know what I expected, but their oysters weren't good, they were great.  I ordered the Chicken Curry with potato, green beans, peanuts, mushrooms, lime & cilantro.  It's quite good, but if you're looking for spicy heat, this isn't that kind of dish."

It wasn't our first choice or a priority, it was a place that came to mind last minute. I'll be honest, I didn't have any expectation. When we entered the restaurant it was pretty empty. I'd expect a little more of a crowd knowing ReHab is just around the corner. What I noticed was the minimal selection on the menu, nothing caught my eye. With no appetite and no prior research of \"what should I order\", I picked something quick and simple off the menu. Our table had fried chicken (heard it was good - didn't taste it), french toast (took a bite, pretty good!), and my order....\n\nTHAI CHILE CHICKEN WINGS - cashew, toasted sesame, cabbage, and lime. First and foremost, presentation was UGLY. Why would you blanket the wings with Asian coleslaw. I had to dig through the messy Asian coleslaw just to see a wing. Digging for chicken wings. The wings aren't the dry wings, they are coated with sauce. The sauce on the wings and on coleslaw are the same and it's that repetitive Asian sauce you see at many American restaurants on Asian dishes. After a bite into the wings, I was presently surprised that I actually enjoyed it. The coating on the wings weren't too thick but it does require napkins and wipes afterwards. \n\nI don't think I'll return because there are far more restaurants in LV to explore next visit. \n\nUntil the next review...."

On my first visit I ordered my go-to, a Rogue Dead Guy, and the Steamed Mussels which were AWESOME. The portion was much bigger than expected, and the broth was flavorful and packed with herbs and chorizo, accompanied with a side of toasted bread for dipping. \n\nI took some friends from out of town here last weekend, thinking we could get some good food in a fun place that wouldn't break the bank. I was nervous in reserving a table for 8 at the last minute, but upon walking in at 9:15pm, I noticed that there was hardly anyone there, much like my first visit. The restaurant is huge, with a large outdoor space, but I don't know why there is never anyone there! Our server was awesome and so friendly and patient with a bunch of hooligans at the table, I regret not being able to remember his name. \n\nMy friend and I shared the pretzel bites and provolone fondue which were fun, and generously sized. The pretzel bites were soft and warm, I think our table ordered 4 orders, they were that popular! We also split the buffalo chicken meatballs which I wasn't a huge fan of, they were slightly tough and dry. The smoked salmon salad was more like cooked salmon that had been infused with a smoky flavor, versus cured, smoked, salmon aka lox. It was still good, and came with some melba toast type crackers for spreading, but wasn't entirely what I envisioned. \n\nGiven the size of the venue, the huge stage available for live music, and the patio, there is so much potential for an awesome dinner/drinks experience. Book bands! Do beer tastings! Pingpong outside?"

But, the rest of the meal was not, so that's how I arrive at 4 stars.\n\nWe had lunch at Culinary Dropout on a weekday around 1.  It was not crowded, a few tables outside and maybe 4 people at the bar.  So, we sat right down.  Our server came right over for our drinks, but after that, service was a little spotty.  I don't know if she was also working tables outside or doing something in the back, but I feel like we went long periods without even seeing her in the restaurant.  So, that was a little annoying.\n\nTo start, we had a charcuterie plate.  This includes a good amount of bread and some jam.  We had a blue, a cheddar, and some Iberico ham.  All of it was fantastic, the ham was, of course, the star.  Soft in texture and almost buttery, it's phenomenal.  \n\nFor lunch, as I noted above, I had the fried chicken.  This includes 3 pieces, potatoes, a honey biscuit and gravy.  They drizzle a little honey over the chicken.  Not so much that it overpowers the dish or affects the crispiness of the skin, but enough so you get a little sweet taste with each bite.  This chicken was excellent.  Crispy skin that adhered to the meat, seasoned meat, and the meat remained juicy (even on the white pieces).  It's a steal at $22.  This dish came with a lot of hype, I had heard from many people how fantastic it was, and it delivered.  The potatoes were fine, both they and the gravy needed seasoning.  The biscuit was not as flaky as I like, and it was lukewarm.  So, those items were a little disappointing compared to the chicken.  But, I would certainly order this again knowing that the other parts of the dish were not as good as the chicken.  It's that good.\n\nThe wife had the grilled cheese and yesterday's soup, which was tomato bisque.  I don't usually care for tomato soups, but I liked this one.  Hearty and had a lot of seasoning.  Good tomato flavored accentuated by the seasoning.  It was of course excellent when you dip the sandwich into the soup.  \n\nI don't frequent the Hard Rock Casino, but I would absolutely return just to eat here again.  I recommend you do the same."

And they are well known for it. \n\nOne thing I do hate about this place and all the eateries in the hard rock is you have to walk into the lobby to use the restroom. It's a pain.\n\nEither way this place is a great little spot and I highly recommend it."

The food was great, I tried brussel sprouts for the first time, and it changed my life. Thanks guys!  I really liked the array of drink choices, and the environment was perfect. Our waitress was a sweetheart. We did wait a while for our food, but we were not in a rush, so that helped. Now- had we been, I would have been wicked irritated to have waited so long.\n\nCasual, trendy and priced right, I plan to go back again for sure!"

We ordered the $22 fried chicken and the $18? French dip sand. They were both very good but my partner was taken aback by how good the gravy on his mashed potatoes were. He even asked me to try them knowing I despise gravy AND mashed potatoes. But I tried anyways and even I thought it was okay. The fried chicken was awesome in my opinion. \n\nI ordered The Room Service cocktail and yum!! I loved it and at the time said it was the best is ever had. Everything I like in one drink. \n\nPlus my server was very friendly and attentive."

From the simple like pretzel and cheese fondue to the more complex flank steak, the place succeeded in matters of taste and presentation.  The decor is impressive and fun.  The wait staff left a bit to be desired, but we were in a large group so it is understandable.  Lastly, the bar (while appearing to be a full bar) had a very limited selection in alcohols.  A really cool place though."

Bacon Bloody Mary was tasty.\n\nDinner for two with appetizer and  two drinks was $90 bucks with tip. They had a pretzel special but waiter said it was only for happy hour but as we left the restaurant the special said NFL Game prices so hubby went back in and they adjusted the check.\n\nGreat service would visit again but just order pretzels, fondue and booze."

I ordered the fried chicken - now, I have to say, I am a Kentucky girl.  I know my fried chicken.  I haven't had awesome fried chicken since I moved out of Kentucky almost a year ago.  Culinary Dropout has ahhhhhmazing fried chicken.  The prices are a bit high, but the food is delicious.  My meal came with three pieces of chicken (a leg, breast & thigh), coleslaw, mashed potatoes & a honey biscuit - for $22.  \n\nThe restaurant, itself is beautifully decorated.  There is an open patio section with cool fire pit tables.  (My description is terrible - go see for yourself!).  I'm a professional photographer & would looove to shoot inside this place.  It's so cool.  The staff was very nice and our waitress held herself together well when some douche grabbed her butt while she was taking his order.  For me, the music was a bit loud.  We could barely hear our friends talking, so it's not great for conversation.  & the only other downside is that it's in the Hard Rock, which is quite possibly the douchiest place in Las Vegas.  We dodged about 10 Bachelor parties and a gaggle of obnoxious drunk girls (at 5:30 in the afternoon - I know this is Vegas, but geez...at least wait until after dark to be so drunk you can't walk.) just getting to the actual restaurant.\n\nGo.  Eat.  Dodge drunk guys.  Be happy."

We ordered off of the Happy Hour Menu, and had a lot of trouble deciding what to order since everything sounded so good.  We wanted to try a few different things to split, and started off with the Hand Cut French Fries, which were good and plentiful enough for us to share.  We also had the Smoked Salmon Bruchetta.  The bread it came with was super hard and I wasn't crazy about the salmon served with it, so I probably wouldn't order it again.  Finally, we shared the Meatloaf Sandwich, which was amazing, flavorful, and perfect for splitting.  Our waiter was extremely congenial and friendly, and even brought out a complimentary dessert, the Bourbon Black Bottom Pie.  That and the Meatloaf Sandwich are worth coming back for!"

I got the captn crunch french toast and it was off the hook! Not as sweet as i was expecting, but very good. \n\nWe split the monkey bread and it was also really good. \n\nOnly complaints were that service was a little slow and someone in my group ordered tabasco sauce when we ordered our meal and didn't come so we had to wait. The server didn't really make any recommendations or have much to say about the menu at all (we asked). \n\nWould certainly return for dinner."

I don't think they have a restaurant that I haven't loved, and Culinary Dropout was no exception. Our server, Elliot was very attentive and it almost seemed like whenever I wanted something he was right there. The atmosphere was very cool. We sat on the patio outside and, despite being surrounded by a huge hotel, the lights and decorations created an intimate atmosphere. \n\nSince this was our first time at the restaurant, we asked Elliot to select some of his favorite items on the menu for us to share. He brought over mini grilled cheese sandwiches, roasted artichokes, soft pretzels with cheese dipping sauce, crispy bread with burrata cheese, pork ribs, and an ahi tuna salad. Everything was fantastic. I had a great time there and will definitely return on my next Vegas visit.\n\nAs you can see by my rating, this is place you should check out."

My friend and I came here for dinner, and while the atmosphere was nice, and the service was good, the food left a lot to be desired.\n\nWe ordered an antipasti plate with a meat, cheese, and the crusty bread and olive oil, which were fine, but what sucked was that they brought it out at the same time as our mains!  It's called an antipasti for goodness sakes, it's supposed to come out Before the main course.\n\nAnother issue was with the mains.  My friend had the Bistro Steak, and he ordered it medium rare, but we're both pretty sure that it came out rare, but it was so covered in sauce that it was hard to tell.  It was also cool when it came out, which was weird.  I had the pork belly cubano sandwich, which was tasty, but super oily.  I'm pretty sure they cooked the bread on the griddle with butter, because while the edges were crunchy, the center was still a little soggy and greasy.  I also wish they had used more of the spicy mustard and pickles, because after the pork belly, those two were my favorite parts of the sandwich.\n\nOverall, 3 stars for service and ambiance, and 2 stars for food."

            "review": "It angers me to be so hyped up about a place and then have to give them such a low grade rating. Overrated, overpriced and under serviced would be the top 3 ways I could describe it. I was so stoked to try the new raw bar, fresh antipasta made in front of you, outdoor seating with firepits restaurant the Hard Rock was offering. Not to mention menu choices like beef stroganoff, ribs, fried chicken, and meatloaf. I for sure thought I would be in heaven. \nNow let me start with the 2 good things about this place.\n1- The ambiance. It was a huge indoor/outdoor 2 bars, view of the pool. AMAZING set up. If you sit indoors, you can watch them make your antipasti platter fresh in front of you which brings me to the the highlight of the meal\n2- THE ANITPASTI! So it was for sure over priced. $8 per cured meat. $5 per cheese. $4 per snack (snacks included olives peppers, bread, etc)\nMy super awesome platter cost $38. Sad that it was the only thing worth it. The meats were perfectly salted and the cheeses were imported. I would actually order this again if I wasn't worried about the cost. \nThats it. All the positives. \nOn to the reason for the 2 star rating. First and foremost the shitty service. Not only was our waiter unattentive and slow. He was careless. He didn't once offer to refill our empty glasses we had to ask. He didn't notice nor care that 1 of the 4 of us barley touched her food due to it being undercooked. (seriously meatloaf pink??) We also noted that our order was put in around 7:30, and we were patiently awaiting our check at 9:20. \nBetween us we had ribs that had jalapeno in the title, yet tasted sweet. 2 orders of undercooked meatloaf. And a steak. \nThe side items were decent, but even the taters that came with the meatloaf lacked consistency. \nMy boyfriend insisted we get dessert since all 4 of us were still hungry and there are not many places in town you can get freshly made monkey bread. Again a dissapointment. Small, and it took more like 20 minutes versus the 10 they claimed it to take. \nOverall the bad food may have been a fluke. I could tell there was a potential for yummy-ness had they cooked the meatloaf another hour, added spice to the ribs, and a little love in their kitchen. On this trip they really lived up the the \"culinary dropout\" name and left a lot to be desired."

They have a large indoor seating area and a fun outdoor patio section with a view of their fancy pool. \n\nHappy hour is Monday-Friday from 3-6pm. All of their draft beers are available in a small mug for $3! They have a good selection ranging from Chainbreaker White IPA, Lagunitas Pilsner, Stella, Apricot Hefeweisen, Coors light, etc. They also serve well drinks and sangria for $4.  \n\nYou can't go wrong with the happy hour snacks. My top two recommendations are the kale salad and pretzels with fondue. The salad is the perfect size to pair with an appetizer and includes unique toppings like beets, cauliflower and goat cheese. The pretzel fondue is really something special! It's a blend of provolone and havarti and is served with soft pretzel rolls. I have begged for the recipe and even tried recreating it myself, but haven't figured it out yet. We have also tried their burgers and bourbon black bottom pie and have been very impressed."

It was amazing. And delicious. And it was probably what put the restaurant over the top when it came to the food. \n\nOur server was attentive and didn't make things awkward. We didn't feel like we were being checked on every 2 minutes. \n\nSomething to note is that the employees here don't have a uniform - they're free to dress in whatever way makes them feel comfortable.

Major props to the manager, Joe for making sure we were taken care of the minute we arrived. The place was pretty crowded because it was during the popular \"Breakfast by the poolside\" hour, so no small tables were available. But instead of making us wait, Joe invited us to sit at one of the largest tables in the restaurant, and there were only two of us! Not only that, but he checked on us frequently to see if we needed anything. \n\nNeedless to say, the food was tasty, the view by the pool is lovely, and it's just a cool laid back place overall to enjoy breakfast. I'd highly recommended swinging by."

We had a reservation, but it didn't matter as the place was half empty. Had a boatload of food and mimosas. Got the pretzels to start and OMG they are delicious as is the fondue that comes with them. I went on to the egg sandwich, which was really solid. The kid had the captain crunch French toast, which was great, but very sweet - almost like dessert. Everyone else loved their dishes as well. The service was friendly and efficient.\n\nSecond visit - Happy Hour with the hubs. Yippee - those 'to die for' pretzels are on the happy hour menu so you know we ordered them. Also got the antipasto plate which had a nice mix of things. Of course, we enjoyed a few cocktails, from the Happy Hour menu as well. And in the end we were, duh, happy. Once again, great service.\n\nI really dig this place and like the d\u00e9cor. Also, like looking out at the pool and cant' wait to go back when the weather is a little cooler and they open the garage doors.  I just hope this place can make it. It wasn't very busy on either of our visits."

'Herb's and Rye' over on Sahara and Valley View,  'Todd English P.U.B.', at the Crystals Shopping with Aria and more recently 'Public House' at The Venetian. All offer a dining experience with lots of great food, great mixed cocktails and most with an extensive beer list. The food offerings are all similar with fresh shellfish at many,  braised and pickled meats, and often rich delicious dessert items. \n\nEnter Culinary Dropout.  Described as a Gastro Pub with 'Amp'd Up Food Fare', the newest addition to the pub scene also includes some pretty amazing classic style cocktails, as well as some more original bar offerings, and a tasty wine list. \n\nAmong my favorite - the \"Smashed Irishmen' a concoction of Guinness, Jameson Irish Whiskey , Honey and Mint.. It's sweet and in my opinion, delicious is  truly an understatement. To go along with that, I had one of the most perfect Old Fashion Cocktails that I have ever experienced, finished with Luxardo Cherries and Fresh Orange.. I know, I know.. mixing liquor can be dangerous.. but seriously fun! \n\nThe food menu is just as varied. An antipasti menu with a superior selection of cheeses, cured meats and vegetables, as well as some very 'comfort-food' style selections. There is a delicious Fried Chicken with Fresh Buttermilk Biscuits,  Pan Seared  Trout with an Almond Butter Sauce, and even a version Panag-Style Chicken Curry with Potatoes. For the slightly more foodie adventurous, Id say to give the Jambalaya shot.. House Made Andouille Sausage, Shrimp and Chicken.. with Pablano Peppers.. sure to set your mouth on fire. \n\nFor dessert.. I'd have to say the Salted Caramel Custard topped with fresh Caramel Popcorn is my absolute favorite, but the Chocolate Peanut Butter Tart comes in close second. \n\nWhatever you end up with, Culinary Dropout has a nice hold on the idea of a place really being fun. Live music, great scenery and quality food and drink. You will find me here often I think. Happy Eating!"

So, when I heard that Fox Restaurants was opening a Culinary Dropout in Vegas, I was very excited.\n\nFun atmosphere, with great natural light as both the bar and restaurant open up to the patio to overlook the pool at the Hard Rock.   Food seems to be right on par from the Scottsdale store - pretzel bread fondue, fried chicken and pork belly cubano, taste just like I remember - great flavor, good portions and good value.  Beer menu and cocktail menu is top ten on the strip (if you want to put Hard Rock on the \"Strip\").  I sat at the bar to watch some Sunday Football, our bartender was very friendly and it was good to see she had her bartending skills honed - technique looked sound and she makes a good crafted cocktail.  Thank god she served us, as another bartender came in later and she seemed to be to wrapped around her nails, her looks and some other bartender rather than serving any of the guests.  \n\nIf only this was a neighborhood restaurant located at the District in Green Valley, I'd be a permanent fixture...  But I look forward to going back soon!  Sam, thanks for bringing Vegas a concept we have been lacking for way too long - next time, bring it to my neighborhood.  :)"

The Menu seemed interesting with a good selection of something for everyone. The layout of the restaurant is REALLY nice! I was shocked when we arrived at 8pm on a Sunday night and nearly the entire restaurant was empty. There were no more than 5 occupied tables. Not a good sign, but based on the high Yelp reviews, we assumed it was just a slow night. \n\nWe started off with the Soft Pretzels with provolone fondue. When it arrived we immediately had to send it back because the cheese was cold. When it came back it was lukewarm and still didn't have too much flavor. For my main entree I had the Pork Belly Ramen which was also disappointing. The Pork belly wasn't tender at ALL (actually rough and hard to chew) and the broth was bland. My friend ordered the fried chicken and it also wasn't good...and it was cold! Our waiter felt bad about the experience and comped his meal, which was a nice gesture. \n\nThe only thing this place has going for itself is strong drinks and a great wait staff. Our servers were super pleasant and accommodating. Not sure if we came on an \"off\" night, but all of our meals were mediocre at best."

I didn't get to see the entire restaurant, but what I did see was really cool.  I sat at the 1st bar when you walk in the place.  The stool was really uncomfortable - there needs to be a footrest ON the stool, not just under the counter.  The server/bartenders who assisted me were very friendly and seemed genuinely excited about the products they were serving.  They have a good beer selection, something that is just now starting to happen more often in Vegas.  The bartender told  me that it is very important to them, the company started in PHX, who has a great beer scene.  The drink prices were a little high, but that is to be expected for the location.  I had the \"cheap house salad\" and the pretzels with fondue.  Both only took a few minutes before they were delivered.  And both were really delicious.  The salad comes standard with ranch dressing, and was tossed perfectly (not too much or too little dressing).  There were tomatoes and onions chopped up in it, along with some other stuff.  Now, the pretzels were AMAZING and totally worth comnig back for.  I don't know how they do it, but the cheese fondue that is served with them is absolutely orgasmic.  The pretzels are great for sharing, and are served in a paper lined dish.  The fondue comes in a small, individual pot with a candle underneath.  They were seriously SO good.\n\nThe menu is really diverse and there are so many different areas of the place, I think that there is something for everyone.  There is also a patio that looks down into the pool, so there is definitely some good people watching to be had here.  :)  I can't wait to go back and try some of their entress (and of course get more pretzels).  Everyone was so friendly and I really like the concept of the place.  Hopefully they are around for awhile, I hear they have quite a following in Phoenix."

My guest and I were seated without a wait. The ambience is cool, yet comfortable. It is difficult to identify servers since they do not have a uniform, but they are very attentive. \n\nOn to the food...like all of the previous posters, you will do yourself a disservice if you don't have the soft pretzels with provolone fondue. If you don't use all of the cheese, save it for your meal. My husband dipped his fries in it and also spread it on his perfectly grilled burger. I had the chicken club sandwich. The chicken breast was grilled, tender, and flavorful. With the turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard, it was a perfect combination of flavors and textures. \n\nI highly recommend saving room for dessert. This was my favorite part of the meals. The monkey bread is baked when you order it, served warm a la mode. Very delicious. However, I think my new favorite is the caramel custard. The very generous portion of the salted caramel custard has a consistency similar to creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It is topped with a thick layer of caramel syrup and their own delicious caramel corn. It is decadent and rich, more than enough to share with one or two people. \n\nThis restaurant may be a good replacement for a fun meal since Johnny Smalls closed."

I have to tell you the atmosphere was so relaxed, we sat outside near the pool at Hard Rock Hotel and lounged on the couches. They even have a Beer Pong table! We ordered the delicious pretzel bites and cheese fondu, which was a hit! But I have to say the Fried Chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy was to die for! This is one of the best meals I have every had on my trips to Vegas - and the prices were so reasonable! I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for good drink prices and some comfort food! What an amazing place! Can't wait to go back to Vegas just to come here :)"

I used to work for Whole Foods as a cheese specialist and I make a killer cheese tray....but their cheese and meat tray is bonkers on point and the fresh cold seafood platter is epic with the BEST cocktail sauce I've ever had in my 35 years. We also ordered steak and pork belly nachos.  I was about to pop the button on my jeans I was so stuffed but we ordered the popcorn and monkey bread to finish off all our dishes and cocktails.   What a great night!  The chef swing by our table and the servers were amazing.  I'm really excited to go back!

Everyone has their own style. The decor is also cool. The chairs and plates are all mismatched but go together. Red, black and white plates are stacked by the kitchen. \n\nNow- the food. \nWe got the pretzels and cheese fondue. Let me just say: to DIE for. Seriously. I could probably just eat that as a meal. Pretzels are big and soft nuggets with just enough salt. The cheese fondue is perfecttttt. \nI got a crispy shrimp Caesar salad. Pretty good, but then again, I've never had any sort of Caesar salad I didn't like.\nMy boyfriend got the prime rib sandwich I think it was? Some sort of steak and cheese. The bread was nice and soft, not all hard and crusty like most rolls I've had/seen. Meat was tender and the cheese was good. I had one fry, wasn't impressed. \n\nAll in all, I loved it all. The service was good. Atmosphere was nice. Good was good. I'll definitely be back, even if only for the pretzels and cheese."

The bites are huge and they give you a huge bowl of the fondue which as a big cheese fan I truly appreciate. Better ratios means extra dipping. \n\nI loved the open concept of this restaurant, a huge open kitchen, tvs for football watching, a cool patio with eclectic decor and funky chairs with a view of the pool and a fun menu with dishes like \"Ma...

Their food is awesome too. For snacks, they make their own potato chips with an onion dip but my favorite thing on their menu are the hot pretzel bites served with a fondue dipping sauce. RIDICULOUS!!!! I ate those 2 nights in a row and could polish off an order all by myself. For happy hour they are half price too!!!  They also have a kick ass kale and corn salad and to-die-for SWEET POTATO CANNELLONI.

I liked that. They had sports on everywhere, friendly staff, and the patrons all seemed to be having a good time. I sat at the bar and looked through thier drink menu.. lots of impressive craft cocktails. I had the spicy tequila one (I forget the name) and it was the best drink I had in Vegas!

Sprawling in size with garage-style doors open to the cool morning breeze of a picturesque patio it was close to the rounded bar with a full view of both stage and kitchen that our trio found itself located mere moments after entry and with coffee kept brimming from seating to finale a six-piece order was crafted, each item arriving individually with smooth pacing and beautiful presentation.  Largely focusing on signatures but equally willing to explore seasonal preps and brunch-only items it was with the restaurant's oft raved pretzel bites that the meal began and with rich fondue gilding golden soft nuggets we all agreed that rare has a pretzel impressed so much, a similar praise heaped on the house burrata with seasonal accoutrements drizzled with aged balsamic.  Moving next to things more substantial it was admittedly with some disappointment that neither the $11 French Toast nor the $21 'worth the wait' fried chicken proved nearly as memorable as their respective milk jam or biscuit plate-mates, but with the former too bready and the later far from crispy there are simply better versions to be found elsewhere, particularly at such a cost.  At this point sated but certainly not full, the kitchen would quickly rally back with a duo of desserts and while the piping hot monkey bread certainly deserves the attention it has garnered it was the caramel-corn studded budino that stole the show for me, a dense pudding both salty and sweet with crunch and cream taken perfectly with another cup of coffee as Chris Cornell crooned overhead."

I decided to go with the chicken sandwich (I believe it was on a focaccia roll). It was relatively good, but not particularly memorable. \n\nAll in all, the meal and the service were ok, but nothing stood out.\n\nGiven the massive amount of dining options in Vegas, I'm unlikely to come back under my own volition, but I wouldn't be opposed if a friend was set on going."

Since we were a party of four, we got to have a few different things around the table starting with the pretzel bites which was more than plenty to share around the table.  I am on a salad kick and therefore ordered the kale and sweet potato salad with the salmon on top, and since I was hungry, yesterday's soup (chicken tortilla that day); the crunchy bits in the salad are pomegranate and overall it was a tasty and filling salad and salmon had a nice, flaky, crusty, finish that seems like the result of sweet glaze that I would love to replicate. My guy got the fried chicken and left nothing but bones on his plate.  I don't recall what the other guy at my table ordered other than his drink which was the \"double blind\" which turned out to be a 12oz can of Schafer Light and 1oz bottle of Smirnoff vodka; we had a great time laughing about it and then he ordered a Corona. The other gal at the table ordered the turkey pastrami, it was huge and she took half of it to go at the end of the meal.\n\nAs important as the food - the service.  I cannot recall the server's name, but he was attentive without being annoying and patient while we waffled over what to order initially.  Drinks were refilled in a timely manner without demand during the meal itself and since it was early and not crowded yet, he was patient without intrusion while we all chatted after the meal.  \n\nQuite possibly my favorite of the dinner venues we visited during the trip."

The menu is fresh and the food is delicious. \n\nWe ordered pork belly toast with chips and dip to start. The pork belly toast is so juicy and flavorful. The combination of pickled items with cilantro, the chili oil, Sriracha aioli, and the tender pork belly on a crispy toast that soaks up all the juice goodness is to die for. I would eat two of these as a meal. I was pretty bummed to share such goodness with my husband. Fortunately, the chips and dip were enough for 3. We took the pork belly toast plate and poured the leftover sauce on the plate all over the chips.  It was fantastic. The French onion dip cooled my tongue down from the slight spice on the pork belly appetizer. The chips were super thin and very crispy. They're perfect. \n\nWhen our food arrived, I ordered some fries since my Korean cap comes solo. It was a lot of meat and tons of vegetables. The Korean flavor was great with some serious spice. I couldn't stop eating. My husband's chicken was hard not to eat, so I grabbed the drumstick and dove in. I love how crunchy and hot the chicken is, and the coating has a ton of flavor. Their chicken is super tender and juicy, and between the homemade biscuit with a but of mash, gravy, and coleslaw-say goodnight! \n\nThe fries were beautiful. They come hot, fluffy, and with the perfect amount of salt. I almost ate the basket solo but I shared at one point. \n\nGood food makes people happy, and this restaurant left me smiling.

Prices were firm for the portion sizes which were not generous-and the Seared Tuna Salad which I ordered was reasonably tasty-but the presentation was lackluster at best=looking like a bowl of lettuce with a few shreds of this or that thrown in and a few chopped up pieces of grey looking tuna which were certainly hard to distinguish from a lettuce leaf-hardly the normal presentation of fresh slices of seared rare tuna one would expect as the featured item in your bowl. Service was mediocre=no refills on ice tea and long lapses with barely a suggestion of dessert on a not full Monday night. Seems like an adequate option if you want drinks and bar food in an interesting vibe-but don't come hungry and expect to fill up unless you order plenty and if eating healthy is the idea-would pass also. Most of the rave food options are fried and heavy on fat loaded dips-maybe the right idea to ward off a hang over.."

Turns out it's turkey made with the pastrami seasoning. It was excellent. In general, things on the menu were a bit out of the ordinary. \n\nThe fries were really good, too. They had a nice seasoning to them and were cooked well, which is something that seems harder for restaurants to do than I'd imagine.\n\nTheir beer selection is a bit meh, with most of the beers being pretty common mega-brews.\n\nThe ambiance seemed a bit \"hip\" or \"cool,\" but we were there when it was pretty empty. Looks like they have live music sometimes, and I'd imagine the place would be pretty loud."

And if so, do we dare host a job interview meal here?  I don't know the origins of the restaurant name - but we did host our job interview meal here last night and had a wonderful dinner!  This is a must see, must eat Vegas restaurant!!  \n\nThere are oh, maybe, 500 restaurants \"to see\" in Las Vegas - this is one of them!  Culinary Dropout blew my mind.  It is beautiful!!   It is Classic Industrial at it's finest!  The furniture is contemporary classic - tufted sofas, wingback chairs, wooden industrial tables.  Simply stunning decor.  Beautifully decorated with a wall of windows overlooking the HRH pool, with a GINORMOUS patio outside that probably seats 100 people easy.  Hands down, best patio dining I have seen in Las Vegas!!   \n\nI'm a terrible Yelper for not taking photos.  I was interviewing a job candidate - not showing off my YELP skillz.  You will have to go see the place for yourself! \n\nThe food?  Oh yeah, the food!  They have an awesome starter menu of Antipasta where each table can individually create their own antipasta plate by filling out a menu card - similar to sushi places where you mark what you want.  We started with a few meats and cheeses - all of which we enjoyed.  They are served with some bread and mini breadsticks that resemble pretzels.  \n\nThe menu contains a little bit of everything.  Really, everything.  From meatloaf, to chicken curry, to fried chicken, to steak, to jambalaya, to a slew of salads and sandwiches.  There is something for everyone here.  \n\nI decided to order the Bistro Steak - served with house fries and a gorgonzola sauce.  I don't consider myself a Steak connoisseur by any means - but this steak was awesome!!  Perfectly tender and juicy and charred - and served off the bone in a strip of mini segments of meat.  The fries are hand-cut and also very good.  My dining partners had the fried chicken and the salmon - both of which were devoured.  \n\nFor dessert we shared the Monkey Bread that other Yelpers recommended.  Served hot with a side of ice cream, it is PERFECT for sharing and was amazingly delicious!!  \n\nPrices are actually reasonable - but if you want to enjoy the place you can expect about $50 per person with drinks for dinner.  Our party of 3 with many drinks, appetizer, entrees, and dessert ran us $177.  \n\nThe service was excellent - their beer selection is \"crafty\" and \"traditional\" and the restaurant ambiance is stellar.  We had a very enjoyable meal - staying for almost 3 hours and enjoying every minute.  I will return here soon with my husband and friends!!"

The hostess did NOT want to seat us at a table and the Bartenders at the bar would not make our drinks because we did not have a table. We were ignored for almost 20mins before someone came to speak with us. \n\nOnce our waiter came, he had a SNOBBY attitude, was very rude and short when answering our questions. We ordered 3 house salads that took almost 1 hour to get to our table. The additional Ceasar salad we ordered was WILTED. The waitress had a problem with taking it back to the chef. No one wants an old salad. All of our appetizers came to the table out of order and to the wrong person. \n\nI will NEVER dine here again and I will make sure I let other people know to not visit this place either. They need to have a serious talk with their wait staff. Customers coming in to spend MONEY shouldn't be treated this way. Before leaving I spoke with the Manager Tony. He appologized, attempted to rectify the situation and was very nice."

            "review": "I am in love with the menu at Culinary Drop Out! Any place with a raw seafood bar is a win in my book. Pretty much everyone front of house is attractive and the place hums with a laid back vibe while maintaining a posh yet edgy atmosphere. So why the two star rating?\n\nEverything sounded better on the menu than it actually was- everything just fell short of expectations. The service here was just terrible. The worst service I've had all year, maybe ever. We waited 20 minutes just to see our server for drinks, we waited even longer for water and the coffee that we ordered never got a refill.. Even though it was requested twice. The courses weren't paced at all so I had soup getting cold while a sandwich got soggy and my oysters got warm. Service is a total bust!\n\nUnfortunately the food didn't make up for the bad service. \nThe cheese fondue which was ordered on the recommendation of our waiter was really a glorified Velveeta. The soft pretzels were good, but really they're just a mode of transportation for the hot melty cheese which arrived at the table with a skin already formed over the top. Really appetizing (sarcasm). Overall, really bland, with no bite.\nThe white shrimp is served with the shell on but cleaned and they were fantastic! Perfectly cooked. Best part of the meal by far! I'd definitely make me way back here for a cocktail and shrimp cocktail if it's not inconvenient.\nThe Kushi oysters which are normally my favorite had a sort of funk, even though it was apparent they were shucked to order.\nThe French Onion Soup was quite possibly the worst I've ever had (and I once unwisely made the mistake of ordering French Onion at Applebees). Bland light colored broth with too much thyme, a round of tough rye bread topped with just a little cheese on top that had been cooked to death. There was no melty stringy cheesy goodness here that you have to wrap around the spoon to maintain a little dignity.. Just a stale crouton witha  crust of hard cheese floating in bland broth.\nThe warm Italian Grinder, also at the recommendation of our server, was nothing special and arrived crisp on the top.. But soggy as all heck on the bottom. This soggy-bottomed sandwich comes with hand cut fries on the side which were the best part of that meal.\n\nEven though the service was so bad and the food so mediocre, I really did fall hard for their menu and will give it another go. I feel like maybe, just maybe, I ordered the wrong items and I got the wrong server, and just went on the wrong day. We couldn't even get our food boxed up and when we did (25 minutes later) it came back with fondue on the side and got my hand all greasy. The worst part of it all was when our waiter finally did come back after his lengthy disappearance and immediately starting clearing away plates, taking away a whole shrimp and oyster. That's $6 worth of deliciousness, man! Always ask before clearing!\n\nTheir specialty cocktail menu had a sleuth of amazingly well thought-out libations and that alone is enough to bring me back. The prices are very reasonable for the strip, and if nothing else- go for a drink, the raw bar, and antipasto. You can't screw up Italian cured meats with a top of the line slicer on hand."

They could have been cleaned a bit better, I had more than a few with some serious grit in them. And I know there's always going to be SOME grit and sand, but this probably could have been remedied with another rinse or two. Good sauce accompanies it, though. Just be conservative with it, the oysters taste delicious on their own. \n\nI had the meatloaf. It didn't taste as good as my mom's (but, really, does it ever, people?) but it was actually better than I was expecting. A solid, well-formed loaf, not too spongy, nice firmness. Seasoning was mild, not too heavy as to take away the taste of the meat. \n\nIt came with green beans, which were extremely underdone. Better than overdone, but I found it odd they'd serve them like that; didn't complement the dish at all. I think it also came with mashed potatoes. The fact I can't remember likely means the other side dish was innocuous enough that it went down good but wasn't worth storing in my mind."

Two of the burgers were not cooked right so we had to send them back to re-cook which was disappointing. The service was great; our waiter was really cool about re-cooking the burgers and was very attentive to our needs. It's a little bit on the pricey side, $15 for a burger is high in my opinion.

It was served with roasted cauliflower and a cauliflower puree and some cut up snap peas. The salmon was moist and cooked perfectly.

Yum.\n\nIt seemed like the consensus was brunch, which surprised the bartender because he said they didn't usually get many people in for breakfast/brunch. No problem, I wasn't planning on breakfast, anyway. I love my carbs, so pretzel bites and cheese fondue it was.\n\nNot sure the Chimayo [beer] was worth the $12, but you can't put a price on experience.\n\nHalfway through, I really had to go to the bathroom (downside of having a small bladder). There's no restroom inside the restaurant. Cool thing is, they let me walk out without having opened a tab with a credit card or paying.\n\nI came back only to watch some middle-aged guy across from me inhale a hamburger and a Sicilian man next to me down two cups of coffee.

            "review": "Made reservations for 6 pm on Saturday before checking out Zac Brown Band. So glad we had reservations as we were walking in, the hostess was telling a party of three, who did not have reservations, the place was completely booked for the night. Maybe it was due to ZBB performing there that night or maybe that's the usual for a Saturday night. I'm not sure. The hostess was super pleasant and our servers were pretty chill and laid back. Not too obtrusive which is just the way I like it.\n\nThe restaurant's decor is fabulous. English Pub meets Vintage Hollywood. Perfect for the Hard Rock. Hip and cool and definitely caters to a younger crowd (or the young at heart). We were seated by the window, which ended up being a quieter table (relatively speaking, of course. The place is loud and unapologetic about it. It is the Hard Rock, after all. Quiet and romantic this place is not.). \n\nThe BF ordered the grilled cheese sliders with fries. I didn't care for either. The bread on the grilled cheese was way too thick, too hard, and dry. Not enough butter, in my opinion. I like my grilled cheese more on the greasy side. The cheese tasted slightly grainy. Maybe the provolone fondue set the bar too high for me that night. The bacon was sparse and a little overdone. The fries were okay. Nothing special about em. The dish looked good but I didn't think it tasted as good as it looked.\n\nI ordered the highly recommended pretzels and provolone fondue based on yelp recommendations. Truth be told, that dish is why I wanted to go to Culinary Dropout. And a little more truth...before I give my opinion on the dish, I need to say I've been going low carb for a while so when I indulge, it needs to be good or I will be a big, terrible, cranky, mean monster. It's true. This was my night to cheat and I was going to do it BIG.\n\nSo, was it worth it? Oh. Yeah. \n\nDid I stuff myself silly?  Yes. Yes, I did. I did share one or two pieces but I wasn't happy about it. \n\nThe pretzels nuggets looked perfect and smelled so good! Deep brown in color and perfectly textured. Crunchy exterior yielding to warm, chewy, and airy interior. Honestly, I could have skipped the fondue entirely. But, I didn't. This was my cheat night, after all! The cheese was excellent. It was a simple meal. But it was a good meal. And I'm still thinking about it..."

We had been to a couple Fox Restaurants in Phoenix, and enjoyed them, so we set Culinary Dropout for our destination.\n \n7pm on a Saturday night, we did not have reservations. The place was not packed, but we were told all the tables were reserved and so we had to sit at a large high-top communal table in the bar area. No big deal. The service was prompt and very friendly. We started with the recommended pretzel bites (they were very good and enough for probably 4 people). Draft beers were $2.95, which I thought was pretty awesome for a Friday evening, and liked even more when I saw the selection. Standard domestics, but also Sierra Nevada, Joseph James, and a Prohibition Lager. Good stuff! For dinner I ordered the fried chicken which was really delicious. The outside is crispy, with a little bit of honey, and the meat inside is nice and juicy - juicy not greasy! It's served with cornbread, cole slaw, and mashed potatoes, which were all excellent. I ate about half of it, and was so excited to have the rest for lunch the next day, but I forgot my to go box on the table! Boo I hate when that happens! My husband had the bistro steak, which was good but not great.\n\nI was very happy when I requested a mocktail and the server asked me about my preferences. We sat and hung out for so long that she actually brought me 3 different mocktails throughout the evening. Awesome!\n\nThe food is a little overpriced, but not for a place in a casino. Our entire tab was ~$100 with tip (included 3 beers, 3 mocktails, 2 entrees, and an app).\n\nBest of all, Jeremy Cornwell was playing from 7-10 and taking requests! If you haven't seen this guy, he's an awesome one-man-band type of show, where he records each beat and then plays it on loop, recording the next beat over it. We talked to him after his set ended, and he'll be at Culinary Dropout every Saturday night, 7-10, and Blue Martini every Tuesday and Friday."

I give the place 3 stars due to the fact that for starters, their bar has no blender and the food was good but not exceptional. I liked the atmosphere which had a nice decor, beers ordered in cans are wrapped in brown paper bags, which is pretty cute. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of different stuff to share. The shrimps were delicious! They were large and juicy cocktail shrimp. My boyfriend doesn't particulary like shrimp, and he enjoyed them and had a few. I really liked the pretzel and cheese appetizer, I actually couldn't get enough of them. \n\nI didn't order a main dish because I wasn't very hungry, but from the looks of my friend's meals, they deliver generous portions and they said it was \"good.\"\n\nI'd come back if I was in the mood for beer.\n\nOne more note, the restuarant has an outdoor area that was closed when my friends and I came. It looks like a nice, cool spot to hang out on a summer night to just hangout with friends. I'd like to come back and hopefully up the rating of this place."

The pictures and reviews made this place sound amazing.  \nUnfortunately, we had a disappointing visit.  First of all, a large group had reserved space near the patio and the patio itself was full, so we were stuck in the front of the restaurant which feels completely removed from the fun.  Next, our server was a victim of a surprise rush and was completely overwhelmed, causing slow service, mistakes in our orders, and constantly being reminded how \"crazy it is in here tonight\".\nThe food itself fell short too.  My wife and I ordered salads that didn't actually get served with the ingredients listed on the menu.  Her Caesar salad was supposed to include kale and my salad was supposed to include avocado (neither made it our our dishes).  One of the most anticipated parts of the meal was the pretzel/provolone app - unfortunately, the pretzels were overdone.\n\nBig time bummer because I think if outside seating would've been available and the place was properly staffed, we could've overlooked the food shortcomings and had a good time."

Great scenery but there were a massive group of drunk guys sitting next to us doing typical drunk dude things. Not their fault and they did a great job of policing the behavior when it got out of hand. \n\nThe server, Ben I believe his name was, was incredibly patient.  He walked us through was great, good, or don't go there items on the menu.  You could tell he really cared about his work and wanted us to have a better than average experience.  He was like this with all his tables, not just us.\n\nWe started with the artichoke appetizer, amazing!  The candied lemon really brought everything tougher.  We enjoyed a stellar bottle of Cabernet from Napa called Newton; well balanced, not too fruity and it went amazing with the steak I had.  My date had the ribs, delightful.  They were a great balance of salty, sweet and spicy; again going wonderfully with the wine.  For desert we had a cross between bread pudding and apple pie, warm with cinnamon and carmel and a side of vanilla ice cream.  My mouth is watering just typing about it.  \n\nIn all, this is a great relaxed date spot or a fun place to meet friends and sit in the sun enjoying good food and drinks.

We used to go to Johnny Small's at the Hard Rock, but took a chance on this restaurant.  We sat at the bar and had the best happy hour food we've had in a long time.  The draft beer was 3 dollars a mug (note, not just domestic... draft), and we got Grilled Cheese Sliders, Smoked Salmon Bruschetta, Kobe Beef on a Stick, Antipasto, and it all came in under 40 bucks!  Amazing wait staff, great bar staff, and this place is now officially on our top eats list when we're visiting in Vegas.\n\nThank you guys for such an excellent culinary experience!"

According to their website, Culinary Dropout is a gastropub created by Fox Restaurant Concepts.  The first time I encountered a Fox restaurant was in Tucson, AZ with Wildflower and it was amazing.  Food was fresh.  Flavors were well-rounded and the decor and staff were very attractive.  =)  Our experience with Culinary Dropout Las Vegas proved to be product of the brains behind Fox.  Though a different type of restaurant all together, all the details similar to my experience at Wildflower came together.  The service was impeccable (waters filled constantly, all staff checking on you, very smartly dressed in hobo chic for girls and vests for guys).  The food was fatty, delicious and well thought out.  The decor was romantic, whimsical and relaxing, so much so that I felt like I was in an episode of The Hills reality show.  Definitely a date night place or nice cozy hang out with your friends.\n\nFoood.\n1.  Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue - Usually not a fan of pretzels, but theses lil' guys were fluffy and perfectly salted and hard to resist once dipped in the warm pot of cheese.\n2.  Grilled Cheese Sliders with bacon and tomato - Baby sliders!  Just as tasty as they were cute.\n3.  Jambalaya - Well rounded, robust and perfectly sauce.  Best jambalaya yet? oooo\n4.  Fried Chicken with honey biscuits, potatoes and gravy - Nothing can beat fried chicken at Ad Hoc in Napa, but this chicken platter had it's own character.  The breading was delicate, light and uniquely seasoned (cumin, my friend Tina says?).  The honey biscuits were slightly sweet and fluffy; I totally commandeered the rest of said friend's biscuits.\n5.  The Pub Burger with havarti, bacon and house bbq sauce - Big burger = Big flavor.  Nice moist burger patty with sweet smokey bbq sauce.\n6.  Monkey Bread - Ooey gooey, warm and comforting\n\nConclusion:  I'm coming back to hang out when I want feel trendy and eat well.\n\np.s.  For the HGTV addicts, we saw Antonio Ballatore and got a picture with him!"

It came out greasy with a biscuit that tasted more like lard and a dash of honey than anything else.  The gravy was not good either.  I ate less than half of the chicken.\n\nMy husband had the jambalaya.  It was basically a bowl of rice.  We were warned it was spicy but that was not the case.  The sausage was flavorless and he had ONLY TWO SHRIMP, both of which were mealy and the size of a quarter.  I've had better quality cocktail shrimp at Du-Par's downtown.  Not worth the price.\n\nI woke up later that night with a racing heart, nausea, and clammy skin.

The first night (a Monday I believe), we were one of two tables eating dinner at around 6:00 p.m. The servers here wear \"regular/hipster\" clothes, and are very helpful with the menu. The very pretty blond server, complete with cutoff shorts, recommended the pretzel and cheese appetizer and fried chicken. Both being Foodies, we inhaled the appetizer. This is their signature dish and it doesn't disappoint. Tom got the fried chicken and I the Italian sandwich. Both were tasty and well prepared. I have the feeling from other Yelpers, that the menu is a can't miss on all dishes.\n       The interior of the DC is modern. They have a square bar, a stage for bands, and an outdoor area with heat lamps. I recommend the bar if you are getting just an app and drinks. On our second visit, we got the pretzel app again an a few beers. They have a great beer selection on tap. We also sampled some Absinthe......wow. So, if near the HRH and hungry, take a chance on the Culinary Dropout. You will be happy you did."

We were hungry, thirsty and needed to start partying after our flight from Orange County. We arrived in Las Vegas at 9 PM, so we were lucky enough to miss the dinner crowd, but I had reservations regardless (which I booked through Opentable.com).\n\nThe restaurant wasn't very crowded, but the people who were there seemed to be enjoying their time drinking and laughing.  Our server was very sweet, accomodating and was on top of our orders.  I wish I could remember her name, I'd like to say thank you for getting our weekend off to a great start with her great service.\n\nThe ambiance is super laid back, casual and teetering on the hipster side.  I can see it working for a party with friends, or a romantic date.  \n\nWe decided to order apps instead of meals so we have a little more room for alcohol (ha!).  We ordered the artichoke hearts, pretzel fondue (that everyone on Yelp is raving about), and a charcuterie of Iberico ham and manchego cheese.\n\nArtichoke hearts:  tender, with a slightly smoke flavor.  It had this cheesy cream that went well with it, topped with baby spinach.  They also drizzled it with an orange marmalade which I personally didn't care for.  I like orange marmalade on toast, but not on my artichoke hearts.  \n\nPretzel fondue:  Everyone was raving about this here on Yelp.  I found it too salty for my liking.  There was almost too much salt on the pretzels and the fondue (served in a cute little pot and tealight warmer) had a slightly gritty texture, and that was salty too, reminded me of Cheez Whiz out of a jar.  Maybe they made it salty on purpose because we were pounding beer after beer to wash it down.\n\nNow for the BEST part of our meal, the Iberico ham: O.M.EFFING.G. Talk about melt in your mouth awesome goodness.  It was like butter, no gaminess, with a slightly sweet note in the back.  It went well with the slightly salty bitterness of the manchego cheese.  They served it with a cherry compote on the side and two pieces of crostini bread and made a fancy little ham and cheese sandwich.  Mind you, they gave us maybe half a cup of thin ham shavings at MP $19.\n\nBottom line, would I come back here?  Probably not.\n\nWith all the various and unique dining experiences Vegas has to offer, I don't think Culinary Dropout is memorable enough for me to take time out of my precious vacation to venture back here.  At least I can say that I gave it a shot, and that I actually finally got to taste Iberico ham."

How could that many yelpers be wrong.?\n\nWell they weren't!  Had the pretzel fondue and yesterday soup for starters and both were great! Soup was very flavorful and came with a slice of toasted seasoned garlic bread. Only critique here might be a little less seasonings on the bread so you can use it to balance the taste of the very flavorful soup to your preference. The fondue was nice and saucy after having a chance to heat up. To make it easier for hungry diners to dig right in, perhaps it could have been melted to saucy consistency right before serving. It was only Luke warm when it got to the table, but warmed up nicely after a few minutes. After that, consistency and taste of cheese and pretzels were great!\n\nFried chicken was the main course and it did not disappoint! Cooked perfectly juicy tasty and tender, you get half a chicken, two sides and a biscuit so be hungry! Or share. \n\nMonkey bread for dessert. Fresh from the oven with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Like a different kind of apple pie a la mode.  If you have room left to enjoy this is the dessert to get! Or jut come in for dessert after a night of party or gaming."

The menu is one page and not complicated to read. The Thai child chicken wings was delicious and tasty for appetiser. I also ordered fried chicken and it was delicious with crispy skin. The biscuit was crumbly and buttery while mash potatoes was moist and buttery too. The waiter was very good on refills and has a friendly attitude. I would come back again."

            "review": "I came here on a Saturday night back in November with my siblings.\n\nThere was a live band playing some good throwback songs, like \"Santeria\". But it was difficult to have a conversation with the person next to me because of how loud it was. It only lasted about the first 20ish minutes that we were there.\n\nOur server's name was Jess or Jessie (I think) and she was great. She made sure we got everything we asked for. She provided us with useful information about the menu items when we asked. She had a very bubbly personality. Just great service from her.\n\nAs an appetizer, we shared pretzel bites with the provolone fondue. The pretzels seemed too salty for my tastes, but once it was dipped in the cheese...it was AMAZING. We considered asking for another order of this once we realized how quickly we devoured them.\n\nI ordered the fried chicken, which came with mashed potatoes, cole slaw, and a biscuit. But I substituted the cole slaw for an extra biscuit. I wasn't expecting the fried chicken to be so damn good! Seriously, it was the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life. It was crispy and I don't know what kind of magical batter they used on the chicken, but it was just perfect. I wasn't a fan of the mashed potatoes. The biscuits were so good. They were soft and the honey on top just made it that much better.\n\nFor dessert, I had the salted caramel custard. And it had caramel popcorn on top. I'm obsessed with salted caramel desserts and this one is HIGH on my list. It wasn't too sweet. And the popcorn on top was probably what made it so delicious. Not only did it taste good, but it gave a nice crunch to this dessert."

I've never been there late to witness if it's noisy or dark as I've read in the reviews was an issue.  \n\nOn the drink menu they had bourbon & vodka mules, like a the 'Classic Dropout Mule' is a Moscow Mule, etc.  I asked if they could make my favorite mule a Dark 'N Stormy, basically like a Moscow Mule, but with rum.  Well, it tasted like a sour margarita and rumless.  My friend got a margarita that tasted like the sour mix mostly.  Instead, I was happy that they had Veuve Clicquot by the glass. And even that was flat.  I didn't complain.  \n\nWe didn't try the most talked about Pretzel Fondue, but I love Pretzel bread!  I always order a 'dijonaise' over cheese when I eat pretzel bread.  I ordered the Turkey Pastrami on pretzel bread with cole slaw and Swiss.  My friend Jeff C. ordered the Grilled Chicken Club.\n\nOverall, not impressive.  I did like the chewy pretzel bread, but it wasn't the best.  We split sandwiches and I'd have to say his Club was better.  Nothing that I would rush back to try again and not even the service.  I am not sure if the menu is different at night or on the weekends.  I don't frequent Hard Rock anymore so wouldn't go out of my way for it."

They're these middling restaurants that cost $50-$75 or $100 for two and they think they're all rad and ... they're not.\n\nI just said to my girlfriend that I would almost drive the 3 hours to Vegas to have the turkey pastrami sandwich they have.  It's fantastic.\n\nWe started with pretzels and provolone cheese sauce.  Again, fantastic!  \n\nThe charcuterie was both generous and the selections were very well-curated.  \n\nI should also mention the service.  In Los Angeles we have actor-waiters.  They suck.  Perhaps not all of them suck but at least 90% of them suck.  We both always tell people to get real service -- and sometimes \"real food\" -- one has to go to Vegas.  This restaurant didn't disappoint.  Anne Marie was amazing.  She knew the menu well and made recommendations that we all enjoyed a lot.  \n\nOh, yeah, the Manhattan cocktail they have is terrific!\n\nWhen we go back to as a couple and not when I'm there for meetings we are DEFINITELY going back here for at least one meal!  \n\nBravo, guys!

We stopped in here before the Rascal Flatts concert at the Joint on Friday and the bartender who served us had the personality of a dead animal.  You could clearly tell that she didn't want to be there.  Part of the experience at a pub or restaurant is the staff and how they interact and she failed miserably.  It's a good thing that I didn't ask her what she thought about any specific wine because I doubt that she would have been able to answer my question but she was able to pour a Grey Goose & Red Bull so she gets a star for that extremely difficult drink(sarcasm groan inserted here).    \n\nI would recommend sitting at the bar here if you don't talk, hate people and want to be left alone.

Culinary dropout fit the bill with nice open seating, patio area to lounge and even live music. I chose the perfect spot. Kudos to me and yelp of course.\n\nWe all arrived on time and were seated immediately. As I said there was live music being performed which was on point. Just as a word of warning I was slightly inebriated for most of the night, but not enough to lose my memory and make an accurate account for this review.\n\nFolks in my party were ordering beers on tap and other alky drinks. They came promptly and the drinkfest continued. Upon reading the reviews of this place beforehand the pretzels with fondue cheese were spoken highly of so the whole table got orders of that and it was bomb. I asked the waiter what he recommended on the menu and he pointed out that the most bang for buck dish was the fried chicken and that sold me. It was good but not mind blowing. There were three pieces; leg, thigh, and breast with a honey glazed biscuit, mashed potatoes and cole slaw. A massive dish indeed. Alky and greasy food go hand in hand.\n\nThe service was fantastic and the vibe and ambiance is well suited for big parties."

After it was all over, I was pleasantly pleased by all I saw and ate.  Amid the fitting sounds of hard rock, the decor of the restaurant is very casual, but seating on a banquette and upholstered chair was comfortable, and servers were very friendly, efficient, and accommodating.  A request for a different salad dressing was immediately granted.\n\nI began with Yesterday's Soup, which changes by the day.  To my relief, this was not like the leftovers of a college cafeteria's previous day's rejected offerings ground up and mixed with broth.  Ginger Soup was on tap on my dining day.  And, this colorful soup literally took my breath away.  I figured out why when I found out from my server that it contained Cilantro Jalapeno Pepper Sauce.  The soup was not very hot but quite spicy, but soon I got used to it and found the distinct taste of ginger to be intriguing.\n\nNext up was a House Salad with many mixed greens and a generous supply of good Sherry Vinaigrette Dressing.\n\nFor my entree, I selected Ma . . . The Meatloaf!?!  Why it is so named I have no idea.  But this was great, very hot meatloaf with a ketchup coating accompanied by really fresh French Style Green Beans and Mashed Potatoes with Brown Gravy.  I also tried the Coleslaw, which was non-creamy and slightly sweet, while Diane enjoyed somewhat odd-looking dark brown but quite tasty and well-made Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Honey Biscuits.\n\nFor dessert we had a Chocolate Toffee Tart and Salted Caramel Custard with homemade Caramel Popcorn on top.  Both were excellent, including the sweet popcorn.\n\nIt was fun to face and watch the chefs at work in the very open kitchen.  When we left, we were very full from the large portions.  Because the menu lists so many intriguing items that I want to try, including oysters and white shrimp by the piece, we will most definitely return fairly soon for additional meals--and will continue to do so if Diane keeps up her winning streak at the Hard Rock's slot machines and draws additional player's coupons for 2 for 1 entrees at Fu!"

Standard greens, nothing creative, this comes with buttermilk ranch. I was praying that this basic salad wasn't foreshadowing what was to come next.\n\nSecond-Course - Turkey Pistrami: This made up for the first-course. Served on a pretzel roll are slices of peppery turkey pistrami and lightly-dressed coleslaw, this sandwich is on the heavy side, but it's delish! \n\nThird-Course - Bourbon Black Bottom Pie: I love this. I can eat this all day long until I barf. This is a rich and chocolaty ganache with salted, crumbled graham crackers that form the bottom of the pie. The light sweetness of the chocolate and the salty crackers pair together perfectly.\n\nService: Good.\n\nOverall: I'm giving Culinary Drop Out an \"A.\" The salad may have been \"blah,\" but everything else was terrific,"

            "review": "I've never been a huge fan of the Hard Rock's dining options in the past.  I don't necessarily dislike any of them, but other than Nobu none of them have ever struck a chord with me and made me want to do several repeat visits or instilled any sort of cravings deep within, and I can't really afford to blow half a paycheck on sushi on a whim so half the time I end up down the street at Firefly before a concert.  \n\nIn planning to see Fiona Apple last night I was excited to try Culinary Dropout from it's positive reviews and creative menu.  Upon arrival I stupidly hadn't thought to make reservations and there was a 45 minute wait.   The hostesses were kind enough to let us know that bar seating was available and we had a seat long these long wooden tables with stools.  I found them comfortable as far as stools go (I typically prefer backs and armrests on chairs #chairsnob), my dining partner that evening found them uncomfortable as the feet rests near the bottom of the stool were set too low for her shorter legs.  The pains of being less than 6 feet tall I guess.  \n\nWe started by ordering some small plates of cured olives and grilled asparagus, as well as some jack and cokes (though some of the custom made cocktails sounded delicious, I'm generally opposed to spending $12 per drink unless it's a last resort or I'm only planning on having 1 or 2, which is pretty much never).   The olives were as expected, and the grilled asparagus which was served chilled with sea salt were very tasty and worth the $4.  Our first order of jack and cokes arrived with what seemed like nearly flat coke.  I'm not one for complaining unless something is egregious so we sucked them up literally and figuratively and let the waitress know for our second order and she very nicely and graciously went to the 2nd bar area for the next round and they were fine (and strong!)  \n\nFor entrees I tried the Pork Cubano sandwich which comes with a side of fries.  My companion ordered the Bistro steak.  Upon arrival I was a little disappointed in the look of both meals.  The steak was quite possibly the smallest steak I'd ever seen on a plate, though to be fair my companion was fine with the size and didn't even finish it (note:  women.  smh) The cuban was on some sort of regular sliced bread and not on a roll of cuban bread as I expected.  That chapter on cubans must have been after the drop date.  The usage of pork belly instead of a typical sliced ham was interesting, and the flavor of the meat itself and the melted swiss was good, but I did expect more out of it upon ordering.   I thought the pickles were too much on the sweet side and I prefer a more sour pickle with a cuban.  The fries were pretty standard, and the sea salt helped those out tremendously (as sea salt tends to do).  Naturally I cleaned my plate despite any flaws, so it wasn't bad, just slightly disappointing.\n\nOn an extremely positive note, our server (Dominique?  That's what the receipt says for Cashier) was fantastic.  Eager to explain the menu, checked on us throughout the meal and was efficient throughout.  \n\nNext time I'd definitely try the Pretzel Bites and a specialty cocktail (or 3), but for now the Hard Rock dining legacy continues for me."

I get the dark ambiance of the Hard Rock and every business within it, but I should at least be able to see my menu without having to whip out my phone for a light source. That being said, nothing on the menu stands out.\n\nThey're really pushing the pretzel fondue, but the table next to us got it and it didn't look appealing. Prosciutto deviled eggs sounded awesome but were in reality a let down- I guess for $4/order, that shouldn't surprise me, but the \"prosciutto\" was more like bacon bits than any other meat I've had. \n\nItalian antipasto salad makes a decent and filling lunch, with ample protein and a tasty dressing. But the \"yesterday's soup\", chicken tortilla, is basic- I mean, at least add some sort of garnish for $7/bowl. Chicken was a bit spicier than expected but overall the dish fell flat.\n\nThe only thing saving this review was friendly service. But I can't eat service... Menu has no direction and the food received did not interest me enough to warrant ordering an entr\u00e9e or returning.\n\nNOTE: HH is from 3-6PM,Mon-Fri. But good luck getting a HH menu, no one seems to want to give them out. Maybe just cancel it if you don't want to honor it?"

It's literally an elevator ride away from our room on the upper floor of the Hardrock Hotel. \n\nLoved the super spacious layout of the interior. Great for groups and it opens out into a patio area near the pool. Great for the lovely summer weather. We came on a Thursdays night around 10pm (they close at 11pm) and the restaurant was fairly empty. Service was attentive and they happily made recommendations. We ordered:\n\n*Pretzels and provolone fondue: Good! I was a little hesitant at first but the whole combination was delicious. Also, the pretzels weren't overly salted but buttery, which was great. Fondue was a great consistency too. \n*Pork belly toast: Good but the open face baguette the pork belly was on was a little soggy. The flavors were fresh and reminded me of a Vietnamese banh mi sandwich. The pork belly was flavored so well, and was cooked so that it was crisp. \n*27 hour pork ribs: Lackluster, except for the fries. The pork ribs were cooked decently, but the molasses sauce was a little too tangy. The coleslaw was really bad. It didn't taste like anything at all. I rather have a side salad raw. The cool thing was that they split it for us because they knew we were sharing. \n*Bourbon black bottom pie: Great! Chocolate ganache and graham cracker crust. Soooo good. The bourbon flavor was actually pretty strong. We got it for free was a birthday treat. Yay! \n\nSIDE NOTE: Culinary Dropout allows their servers to wear anything that they want, this include jewelry and facial piercings. While our server was talking to us, his lip ring fell onto the floor and we never found it. While it wasn't a big deal to us (although I found it hilarious), I'd imagine a worse situation in which it could have fell into a drink or food. Sooo...just keep this in mind. =P"

So, that being said, the food made everything else worth it. \nCons: it was very noisy, but we were at the hard rock hotel, so that's to be expected. My biggest issue was the temperature. It was about 107 outside and for whatever reason they had the wall behind the bar open, which let all the hot air in. I was literally sweating balls the whole time and it was after 9. Uffff.

Others raved it was amazing and worth it. \n\nThe hostess was great and seated us near the bar. We noticed it was incredibly hot in there and asked the staff if the air conditioning was on. Then I noticed the large sliding door behind the bar was open. Why would you have it open in June with it 95+ degrees outside. We were about to leave, but decided it would be worth it to stay.\n\nOur server was the next bad part. He came right away with water but when we told him we were ready to order he told me he is only taking drink orders right now. We settled with just water. He came back 20 minutes later to finally take our food order. Again, we stayed because we knew it had to be worth it.\n\nI ordered the fried chicken of course and my buddy ordered the stroganoff. Luckily it didn't take too long for the food to arrive though it wasn't fast either. I was starving by the time it arrived. I took a bite into the chicken and didn't really expect the honey glaze. It was alright, but just a little surprise. The chicken was cooked amazingly. The breast was very juicy and not dry at all. It did need some more seasoning though. It came with gravy so i guess you're supposed to dip it into it. The gravy was pretty bad. It tasted like it came in a paper pouch that you buy for $.50 at the grocery store.\n\nThe side dishes were not good. The cole slaw was soggy and lacked any flavor. Even with a ton of salt & pepper it didn't taste very good. The mashed potatoes tasted bland. What restaurant just serves mash potatoes with no seasonings or spices in it? Again, the gravy was bad. The biscuit though was really good. The honey crust on top was flavorful.\n\nI wouldn't come back here. Everything on the menu was overly priced and sorry but the chicken was over hyped. Sure it was fried very nicely, but lacked spices."

At first, I had my doubts, because it looked a little too \"hipserty.\" But my doubts were put to rest by our great waitress and the tasty food and drinks she delivered.\n\nWe each had a couple of the $3 mug beers. What a great deal! This wasn't PBR or its ilk; these were actual IPAs and pale ales! And although we split only two small appetizers, they were great values as well -- and one was pretty outstanding. The homemade potato chips and onion dip were a retro take on the classic snack. Fine enough, and well worth the happy hour price ($3). But the smoked salmon bruschetta ($6) was fantastic! Reminded me of the smoked fish dip at Ted Peters in St. Pete's, FL. We could have eaten that all day. It doesn't look like it's on the regular menu, so if you want this little slice of heaven, you'll have to hit happy hour. But why wouldn't you? The regular menu prices seemed a bit high ($22 fried chicken, anyone?), but these really felt like a steal.\n\nWe used to go to the Pink Taco for happy hour on a fairly regular basis, but I think I've found a new favorite.

Not a special custom/mixed ketchup, it was straight out of the bottle (my mom makes a better meatloaf). ......and the mashed potatoes... were not edible. They were cold and bland.

After reading a couple of reviews and checking out their pictures, I liked that it looked like a \"chill\" spot with live music, good drinks and great food.\n\nTo begin, the decor was very intimate and yet somewhat hipster-ish yet industrial at the same time.

All of that is great but isn't the real reason the place marks my top 10 list in Vegas, it's the food. If you go here for no other reason than to eat pretzels, you will still leave satisfied. The pretzels are bite-sized pieces (although tough to get in one bite) with an amazing provolone cheese fondue.  I have tried most dishes on the menu and none of them disappoint. This is also a great first date place where you can get a meat/cheese plate with a glass of wine and not have to worry about what side of the plate to sit your fork. Excellent."

Well it was only just okay, the restaurant itself is really nice it gives off an eclectic vibe. Our waitress (her name is ray) she was awesome, she was extremely attentive, super friendly and did her job well! On to the food... I had the famous fried chicken (well I'm from the south) and this isn't anything to write home about it was dry and tasteless. My husband had the grill chicken sandwich and said it was decent. The drinks (I can't remember the names) but mine was some type of apple with rum and beer it was awful I took two sips and could not finish it. I gave them 3 stars because the server was great the place is nice but the food needs work!"

            "review": "This review is based on their fried chicken meal.\n\nI love fried chicken.  I just love it.  This place has many highly rated online reviews.  I rarely get to eat fried chicken, so when I do, I want to savor the best.  The dish cost $22, which although it's high in price for fried chicken, I understand being in the Hard Rock Hotel carries a premium on everything. The dinner comes with a fresh made buttermilk biscuit, mashed potatoes w/gravy, slaw and half of a chicken cut up and fried.\n\nLet me remind you, I absolutely love fried chicken.  I came during lunch, mid week, with about 4 tables sat in the venue, so it was not busy.  My chicken was either cooked too long and burnt, or the grease was very old.  After years of experience with fried chicken, I'm going to say the oil was old.  The batter they use is very light in flavor and spices. The chicken breast had many small broken bones, which I'm assuming came from where the wing was attached.  You don't get the wing, by the way.  The portion size for the breast, thigh and leg were all very small.  Such a disappointing fried chicken experience. \n\nThe buttermilk biscuit was doughy instead of flaky.  I was unable to enjoy it.  It had too much butter in the middle which made it even more dense.  The mashed potatoes had a very stale gravy flavoring.  Even the lemon in my drink was cut the previous day.  Nothing like getting a drink with a very old and dried lemon wedge to remind you that you're not enjoying fresh food.  When a restaurant cuts back by saving garnishes for the day, they are focused on the wrong thing....customer satisfaction and enjoyment.  A case of lemons in these hotels cost around $25 for approx 200 lemons.  A standard Sunkist 8 wedge fruit cutter will yield appros 1600 lemon slices per case, or $0.015 cents per wedge.  Even if you save just 50 slices a day, you've only saved 78 cents, and at the expense of pissing off 50 customers. \n\nThe server and managers were both very courteous and friendly."

We stayed just long enough to experience food envy and opted for a snack- the fresh oysters were delicious at just $3 each. The star was the hand cut chips with house made French onion dip!

Yea it hard rocks. \n\nOverall the dinner me\u00f1u is not too extreme but the food is still at to above average but the phenomenal drinks, trendy vibes, and super friendly service totally make it worth it. \n\nI actually enjoyed the pretzel cheese fondue but the burrata, that was amazeballs. It's a semi soft slightly sweet cheese with chimichurri and marinated tomatoes. It's like a Spanish version of a bruschetta. Definitely try it. \n\nThe fried chicken is phenom... Hang on to the cheese from the pretzel fondue, it's good for dippin!  I had the pork belly sandwich and it was thick cut, juicy, and tender. \n\nFavorite drinks: honestly I'm more of a red ale, malbec, and straight up martini kind of guy, but this is one place I have ventured a bit... At least so far as trying everyone else's drinks. That counts!\n\nDrunken Irishmen, clown punch, malbec. YUM"

Decided on trying this place , it was a wise choice. First of all the waiter was the bomb, Adorably cute with blue hair and tattoos , huge smiles friendly and attentive. Took the time to explain everything and gave refills or anything we needed in a timely manner. So the service was golden for that it would be five stars.\n He suggested the pretzels with fondue, carbs are my enemy so we said no... which we regretted later as everyone else ordered them and they looked really good. \nordered: ( We mixed it up and shared so we can check it all out)\nSide salad , tasted a little funny to me, it was ok.\nChicken noodle soup, had an Asian flair to it. Very unique and not too salty.\nFried Chicken comes with mashed, Cole slaw, biscuit . Chicken was super tender.\nSteak with brussels sprouts potato and mushrooms. The brussels sprouts were so good we ordered extra~!\n Didn't have room or time for dessert.\nA 4 star because soup and or salad should have been included in the price for dinner... But hey I am cheap...;)\n A good choice if in the Hard Rock Casino."

The fondue that comes with it is just the right amount of cheesy.  Flavorful but not so strong that it kills your taste buds.  \n\nI can't say enough about the Ramen.  It was very delicious.  The pork belly was not chewy and I was sad when I had no more left in the bowl.  It was seasoned well.  I just wanted more!  \n\nIt was a great meal.

When we arrived at 5pm, the place was mostly empty, which was fine. The hostess was Very Friendly and Talkitive. The inside was nice, a little funky and casual. Our waiter arrived shortly after and took drink orders. I was a bit suprised at how laid back he was, i knew from reading reviews that staff wore street clothes, however it took me byu suprise when out waiter pulled up a chat to take take our order. He was friendly and asnwered the million questions i had. We had crusty bread for an app., it was great (i love bread) The drinks we ordered were AMAZING, The service was quick and our food arrived hot. I got the pub burger, which was one of the best burgers I have ever had. My husband got the meatloaf, which was pink on the inside, really pink. He ended up sending it back, the manager came over to our table and explained it was cooked, it looked pink because of the way it was cooked but they were making a new meat loaf for my husband, He was very friendly and professional. Once the meat loaf came out it was done perfect. We decided that we were going to have dessert and otdered the monkey bread, our waiter let us know its made fresh so it will 8-10 mins. Between the time we waited for the meatloaf and when we ordered dessert, they got busy, which put them a bit behind. So after 15 mins of waiting for our dessert (whioch it didnt seems that long, we were having a nice time talking and having a drink) the manager comes over to the table, and lets us know he has good news and bad news, the bad news is our monkeybread is going to take another 8 mins but in the mean time they are going to comp us andother dessert for free and sets down the salted carmel pudding with house made carmel corn. It was wonderful, the best pudding i have ever had. Once out monkey bread arrives our waiter lets us know that is on the house as well, i treid telling it was fine we were more than happy to pay for it but he wouldnt add it to the bill. My husband loved the monkey bread. i did not have any becuase i was beyond full. We had a wonderful experince, the staff and manager were all great. I can not wait to go back!"

The service was outstanding and the food was all good... wife had the fried chicken, which she loved.  Our entire party shared food with each other and we all agreed all were a hit. Perhaps the only drawback for some in our party was that the Hard Rock pool is adjacent and the pounding house/trance music was an irritant.  I, myself, actually enjoyed it, though. Nothing like bouncing in your seat while drinking a good drink, eating some tasty food, and watching the pool patrons do their thing."

I came a little later than 8:30pm on a Sunday; and it wasn't too busy to handle our 12 person party. \n\nAlready when I sat, I was greeted with my friends telling me not to order Hennessy and/or the oysters because \"they were out of it.\" Hmmm, ohhkaaay ---- I guess that ruled out those options.\n\nI ordered a Moscow Mule and was saddened when it came in a regular glass cup. Sure, I would get a dollar off for bringing my own copper mug (as stated on their menu) but, who really carries around a copper mug. And if this place is gonna have 3+ assortments of \"mules\" then they need to have \"The Mug!\"\n\nAs we chit chatted, the waiter comes back to tell my roomie that the olives he ordered for his anti-pasti \"wasn't ready yet\" because \"it wasn't cured.\" --- what does that even mean --- My sassy 'tude was like, \"is it sick?\" My roomie said to just bring out the bread, sundried tomatoes, and balsamic. It was decent. Balsamic was sweeter than most I've had. In the end, it wasn't anything special.\n\nMy friend, who was sitting next to me, got the salmon entr\u00e9e. And lemme tell you that his first reaction to the dish was priceless; almost jaw dropping awe lol \nHis first words were: \"THIS was $25!\" (((Hence the picture/meme I have to go with this review))) The salmon was smaller than most salmon I've bought at the grocery store. It laid on less than handful of brown rice and veggies. My friend said: \"this would be the perfect dinner for someone on a diet -- too bad that aint me.\" Funny thing is this is what the waiter recommended as \"the best thing on the menu.\" \nMy friend had to share his girlfriend's burger and fries to get even some fulfillment. **SHRUGS**\n\nI shared the jambalaya with my roomie and that was spicy enough to my liking and even though the chicken, shrimp, and sausage jambalaya was mixed in with rice; our Asian asses still ordered a side of rice with it.\nOther friends got the steak, meatloaf, curry, and prime rib dip sandwich. Everyone was pleased with their food but, in the end, it was nothing that stood out.\n\nAll the while we're eating, we were never filled with our water nor ordered more alcohol. It was just a less blah. \n\nEven their monkey bread dessert, which we were told could serve 4 ppl, COULD NOT serve 4 ppl. It was like bite sized cinnabon donut holes if they had that.\n\n\nOur waiter was funny tho and did the best he could with what he had, I'm sure. \nAnother thing I'm sure about is that I won't be back."

From the hostess to the janitor, everyone in this joint was freaking beautiful. What does this have to do with quality food or service? NOTHING. But its just a fact everyone should know. Boom!\n\nI actually ordered a couple things: Fish N Chips, Grilled Cheese, and The Turkey Pastrami. Without going into details, the Fish N Chips were ridiculously small and the Grilled Cheese was elementary. However, the Turkey Pastrami was incredible. It wasn't as greasy as the usual pastrami and tasty as hell! \n\nDid I mention the employees? No, besides the fact that they were goddesses, the service was fantastic. I like to ask a waitress how something [that sounds gross] tastes. I wanna test their integrity. I love it when they say, \"Don't order that.\" And that they did! I like honesty.

We sat at the bar until we noticed the fire pits and big comfy chairs. \nWe moved over outside and our bartender, Dylan was accommodating enough to continue taking care of us while we went out. Must say, he's a great bartender! Accommodating, fun, and most of all makes delicious drinks. \nCocktails I had: Deviant behavior - comes with a side of Belgian white beer. Not my favorite, I'm not a fan of cocktails with beer I guess; Monkey See, Monkey Do - delicious! It has rum and pineapple, among other things, really good! Pomegranate Yuzu Mule - my favorite drink, so freaking good! I subbed vodka for gin (he is not my friend), it comes with yuzu sour, pomegranate juice, and fresh pomegranates on top. \nWe also tried their potatoes chips which were pretty good. My friends loved them.\nI really enjoyed our time here, next time I come I will make sure I'm hungry so I can try some of the food. The food menu looks very promising."

            "review": "It was just after 11 AM and the fianc\u00e9e and I were waiting for our room at the Hard Rock to be readied.  We decided to grab lunch while we waited and made the call to try Culinary Dropout.  Culinary Dropout is a part of a chain of restaurants from Fox Restaurant Concepts primarily in Arizona but across the West.  Culinary Dropout describes itself as a gastropub with \"creative cocktails\" and an \"inked-up\" staff.  It lived up to the description and it was good fit within the Hard Rock.\n\nWhile we were looking over the menu, we started off with drinks.  I had the Maria Pepino ($10) made with Espolon Blanco tequila, spiced tomato juice, pickled pepper juice and garnished with an olive, pepper, and lime.  It was nicely balanced and spicy.  The pickled pepper juice made for a great accompaniment to the light tequila.  To accompany our food, I ordered the Last Man Standing ($10) made with Old Overholt rye and spiced tomato juice, served with a salt & pepper rim and a dill pickle spear.  Being a big fan of rye whiskey, it was even more satisfying than my first round.  For our meal, we split a pair of appetizers, the Black Mussels ($13) and Grilled Artichokes ($13), and the Korean Style Ribeye Cap entr\u00e9e ($32).  We received maybe a pound of mussels that were fresh and properly cooked.  They were bathed in a flavorful broth made with spicy sausage of an undetermined type (I assumed chorizo), amber ale, and accompanied by a couple of slices of grilled bread.  It was a satisfying dish.  The grilled artichokes were less successful.  We received a single, small-sized artichoke cut in half, brushed with oil, grilled, seasoned with sea salt and served with lemon aioli.  While the artichoke really had a great grilled flavor, picking up a nice smokiness, from what I'm assuming was from a wood-fired grill, the small size of the head did not withstand the cooking well, drying it out, reducing the already small amount of \"meat\" to be found.  It was overpriced and a disappointment.  Our Korean Style Ribeye Cap (maybe a 6 oz. cut) was cooked perfectly to our requested medium rare and and seemingly topped with a red chili pepper, kimchi-style sauce and pickled vegetables and cilantro.  It was immensely flavorful.  Therein lies the conceptual problem with the dish.  The ribeye cap is nicknamed \"Butcher's Butter\" and is touted to be the tastiest cut of beef.  Sadly, the bold sauce covered up the meaty goodness of a cut that probably should've been left unadorned.  I liken the use of ribeye cap in this dish to that of making hamburgers with A5 kobe beef...a waste of a great piece of meat.  A different, less expensive, cut of meat should've been used for this otherwise tasty dish, which could've dropped the price by $7-10.\n\nIn the end, Culinary Dropout got its GED (Good Enough Dining).  Service was a strength as it was friendly, attentive, and really made us feel like welcomed guests.  Its cocktails were well conceived, well made, and a solid value.  The food, however, while flavorful, suffered from questionable decision making on how dishes were prepared and from pricing that did not offer a lot of bang for the buck."

The fried chicken smelled good, however after cutting into it we noticed it was pink and still bleeding. We did inform the manager, however we were told that is normal. I'm pretty sure you can get sick from eating raw/under cooked chicken. \n\nOur server Billy was ok, sometimes you catch people on a bad day.

Pretty yum with a sparkling sweetness!\n\n[[ Pork Belly Toast ]]-- recommended by the server and it tasted surprisingly asian. Pork belly wasn't super crisp but rather fatty and thick. Served on a single baguette slice, cut in 3. The sauce was sweet and tangy with maybe bit of soy sauce? Delish!\n\n[[ Shaved Prime Rib Dip ]]-- mmmm!! Super soft bread with a very FULL serving of tender (not dry!) shaved prime rib. It made the sandwich super easy to eat but also fed the appetite all night. I suggest getting the coleslaw with it.\n\n[[ Grilled Cheese Sliders ]]-- How adorbs are these tiny sliced bread as my sliders! Haha comes with 3 sliders. Cheesey cheese and bacony bacon! There's a slice of tomato in each but it didn't do anything for me. \n\nAmbiance was casual cool and I appreciated that it was not the bit pretentious.
