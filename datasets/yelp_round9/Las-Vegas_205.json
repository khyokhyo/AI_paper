When we arrived, there was a line but not too unbearably long. The line however, took a deceptively long time. Once we finally got our crepes they were pretty good. My friend ordered the bananas foster crepe and I got the tomato and cheese crepe. Both of these crepes were very good."

So you can sit and eat it in the neighboring sit down area, or walk and eat. \n\nThe crepes are all made fresh to order. This particular crepe was slathered in Nutella, dolloped with a generous amount of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, and made me a happy girl. \n\nThere's no room for disappointment here!"

I just use Sofie as it was as easy name to use.  The person making the crepe was even worst.  She seem to throw thing every where & the crepe look very sloppy but it look nice once she add the wipe cream & chocolate syrup (I think that was the only good thing that came out of it).  When I eat it, it was not good at all.  It did not taste sweet at all & the strawberry was ver sour. I don't think I would come here again. Just hope that they would train service better."

(I REALLY wanted one of those delicious-looking dessert ones, but I had a busy day and didn't want to be in the bathroom all day later)\n\nI think I paid around 8:40 (and there were only like 5 people ahead of me in line, too) and FINALLY got my crepe around 9am. \n\nThat being said, the reason that it takes so long is that they make them fresh, so they are delicious. I will say I asked for no asparagus, though, and was told they couldn't do that, because they use a mix or something strange like that ... but it tasted fresh.\n\nThe roasted chicken one had chicken, asparagus, sundried tomatoes, I think onions, and a pesto sauce, and was pretty good. Price range from $9-11 or $12. \n\nI will say that my parents have been to Paris's \"Le Village Buffet\" before, though, and you can have made-to-order crepes there, so if you think you'll want more than just a crepe, you should check that out - they have both crepes and omelettes.\n\nI'll come back here next time I'm in Vegas, I want to try either the caprese crepe (savory) or one of the dessert ones, which looked amazing."

            "review": "I'm a huge breakfast lover. I can have French toast, crepes, or omelets at all hours of the day or night. When I was told that the Paris had an amazing crepe place I practically started running toward it. But when I finally saw the restaurant I got kind of bummed. I was expecting an actual restaurant and not a walk-up stand. But after realizing that it's supposed to resemble the walk-up creperies in Paris, France I was okay with the idea.\n\nThe line didn't take too long (maybe fifteen minutes or so) but when we're all about to eat our left hands out of hunger, fifteen minutes feels like an eternity. Finally we got to the front of the line. The menu has several savory crepes with meats and cheese as well as dessert crepes with berries, whipped cream, and other sugary additions.\n\nI pretty much only like dessert crepes so my eyes lit up when I saw their abundance of fruits and sauces. I went with the Favorite crepe (with fresh berries, whipped cream, and topped with raspberry coulis). It was served to me at the pick-up counter on a cafeteria trey and a plastic plate. Lame. I then had to turn the corner and grab a plastic knife and plastic fork. Lame. Then came the really fun part; watching over people like hawks until a table opens up. The small seating area is just next door to La Creperie but it's open to anybody that wishes to sit there (surrounding snack stands, or people just giving their bunions a break).\n\nAfter a couple minutes, we snagged a table and began digging in to our lovely crepes. They were almost impossible to cut into. The plastic utensils, plastic plates, and plastic treys made the crepes slide about relentlessly. After finally wrangling the thing down and cutting it up I got to taste it. Sheesh. I now understand why people were telling us to go here. The crepes were fantastic. However, I was somewhat distracted while we were eating. Several Miss America pageant girls came in and sat at the table next to us, fully equipped with tiaras and sashes. Awesome.\n\nA tip after eating at La Creperie, go just across the walkway and pick up one of the humongous Eiffel Tower margaritas. You won't be disappointed!"

But either it had too much sauce or it was too salty.  One tasted like lasagna, the other was just salty with ham or something.\n\nNot eating here again."

I know that's not saying much to you because you don't know me but to me that's saying enough :P\n\nWe almost always stay in Paris or Ballys because of free rooms, and this always leads us to spend our hangover down in Paris.  Walla.  Crepes.  The line is always long but you can get some red beer or a bloody mary across the way to help you with your hangover.  They have breakfast crepes that have like eggs and bacon etc. in them (numerous varieties) or they have sweet crepes that are filled with fruit concoctions.  I hate deciding because I love sweet things more but know that the other stuff is better for me. They have scallop crepes and vegetarian crepes, you name it.\n\nThe crepes are huge, filled well and I've never been with anyone in our party who was disappointed.  Good stuff."

A little tucked away but so cute and fits well into the Paris theme. \n\nSo this place serves some of the best crepes I have ever tried! I had the roasted chicken crepe (ask for extra pesto ) and my friend got the breakfast crepe. Mine was cooked perfectly! There were so many different flavor a going on and the pesto added the perfect touch to this already rich crepe. My friends crepe was OK (why she kept stealing mine hehe) \n\nI would've given this place five stars except service was not good. The lady at the register seemed irritated and was not polite.

I actually yelped a crepe restaurant while we were on the strip and we purposely went to Paris only to go to La Creperie. You would think a crepe shop inside Paris hotel would be really pressured to perform up to a certain standard. All I can say was it was DEFINITELY not worth the price. \n\nThe crepes itself didn't stand out. Mine looked like it was literally thrown together. The whipped cream was sliding off the crepe and pretty much off the crepe and on the side by the time we sat down. The nutella was plopped on the crepe like as a splatter. The presentation was simply just ugly. \n\nAs for the service, I was appalled by how rude the lady was. I had asked if they had a crepe with strawberries and bananas, she said they could do the fresh berries with bananas. She then proceeded to tell me they charge for extra banana, which I was ok with. After getting my order however there were no banana. I asked her and she replied with \"oh you didn't order banana, you asked for nutella.\" I replied with an assuredness that I DID ask for banana and she continued to be rude saying I didn't. I couldn't believe it. So I walked away an unsatisfied customer. \n\nOverall, never going back there."

WTF ? I didn't ask for bottled water. Just a couple of glasses to drink your tap water. Sorry sir - glass you pay for but water is free.\n\nThe END : I was carrying an empty tall glass which was once filled with Margarita. I went to the soda machine - stuffed my glass in there & drank a tall glass of FREE WATER.\n\nIf you own this place & are reading my review - STOP being cheapskates. You are virtually violating us with the prices - atleast give us a glass for water."

Unfortunately they changed their menu within the last year or two. (Last time I was here was 05/2013) They no longer have the Fruits de Mer (savoury seafood,mozzarella/ mushroom crepe w/ bechamel sauce). It has been replaced with a subpar shrimp scampi crepe. They also replaced their pear/walnut/almond/Chantilly cream crepe with a pear/hazlenut/maple syrup/golden raisin crepe. Also subpar....the flavors just don't go together as well as the former. The raisins are very overpowering. Not to mention the size of the crepes has shrank significantly as well, while the price has increased. :( I guess the consolation is that it is still entertaining to watch the crepe being made. :/\n\nThere used to always be a super long line, no matter what time of day. Last couple times I came during lunch (11-2ish), and there was only me and one or two other people. I sadly will probably never come back....unless they bring back the Fruits de Mer! That was the best crepe I have ever eaten! ^__^\n\nAlways the optimist, I will pass by next time and glance at the menu, fingers crossed hoping that they bring back the old menu..."

I love crepes and this place satisfies my cravings. \n\nWhen in need for good food quick, come here (only during the non rush hours and non-holidays week).  They don't have an actual restaurant.  La Creperie is a food stand that has a large kitchen.   It is located in Paris.  You order the food at the cashier and just wait for your number to be called.  \n\nMy favorite crepes:  St. Louis ( prosciutto, cheese, basil with bechamel sauce) and the Napoleon (Lemon Custard with Raspberries, Blueberries, and Strawberries).  We also ordered one that had salsa on top, but I can't remember the name.  It was also really good.\n\nGood crepe:  Toulouse.  It taste like a Calazone. \n\nAll the crepes cost about $8-10.  The portions are HUGE.  My 3 sisters and I shared 3 crepes.  It was very very filling! \n\nCons:  When you go during a holiday week, expect the wait to be LONG.  We went during Christmas week and it literally took us about 40 mins just to order and get the food.   However, when I ate here during a non-holiday week, I got the food instantly (10 mins).  Also, there is a seating area right next to the stand, but finding a table and chairs is INSANE!! Honestly, it's like a whole new world... you see the ugliest side of a person.  There's so much tension and hostility when people are looking for a table and chair.  My family was lucky enough to find a table but just trying to get one more chair took 20 minutes.  Also, while you're eating, you can feel and see people lurking at your table and ready to grab your table once you are done.  It's like a jungle.  *Survival of the Fittest!*  However, please remember that I went here during Christmas week.\n\nOverall, I totally recommend this place!"

It's a special place for me, because on our first trip to Vegas very early on in our dating times, my now-fianc\u00e9 and I must have eaten like 6 crepes from here.  I think I've tried nearly everything on the menu that isn't meat-y.\n\nThe crepes are $9.99 and come in sweet and savory varieties -- we mostly go with the sweet -- my favorite is the peanut one, but strangely I don't order it much due to its richness.  My second favorite is the D'anjou pear one with walnuts.  The apple one is the most basic, and they all come with this yummy whipped cream on top that melts into the crepe -- we get it on the side to save my stomach from lactose issues.\n\nThe one savory one I've tried is the one with ratatoulle and egg... very tasty and fresh.  I love that all the crepes are made-to-order and generous.\n\nThe only downside is the seating.  Except for the one time we showed up shortly before it closed,  we literally have to circle the eating area to the left of this place to be able to sit our butts down the second someone leaves.  Otherwise, you'll have nowhere to sit and enjoy your yummy crepe.  Overall, a cheap snack or meal."

Everyone was patiently waiting which was a good omen as any foody knows. The prices ranged between $8.95 and $11.95. The creperie is a tiny operation with a front person taking orders and two cooks. It is attached to much bigger bakery, the Boulangery. They  make fresh French bread , croissants, and tons of hot croissant-based sandwiches.

Actually, we stopped that time cause our niece and nephew wanted crepes, and there were no lines on that occasion.\n\nThey've got the usual crepe choices.  Both savory crepes and dessert crepes.  I always prefer the dessert crepes cause I am such a sweet tooth.  The prices are expensive compared to most crepes that I've had elsewhere.  Although, if you are a Total Rewards member, then you get a discounted price of 50 cents off.  Still expensive though.\n\nOur niece and nephew both enjoyed their choices while my wife and I thought our orders were just average.  Both my niece and I ordered the Nutella crepe which contained nutella, bananas, candied hazelnuts, cream, and caramel sauce.   She said she would give it 8 out of 10.  I thought that for the price, it was just average.  It tasted fine, but it should be priced 2 to 3 dollars lower.  Same for the other crepes that we ordered which were the mixed berries crepe and the ham & cheese crepe.  \n\nOverall, just 3 stars because the crepes are overpriced.  I know that we're on the Las Vegas Strip, but come on!  Well, obviously the prices do not hurt business cause they usually have people waiting to order at the window when we walk by.  Good for them."

The fruits de mer has succulunt shrimp and bay scallops covered in a \"lightish\" bechamel sauce (as light as bechamel can be).

Sadly, we were met by a long line which did not seem to shorten at all, thanks to only one working cook and two crepe grills. Assuming that every customer orders 1-2 crepes each, it is not surprising that the service was very slow. I ended up waiting for 15 minutes to get one crepe. \n\nThe portion is pretty general, though. One crepe is definitely split-able between 2 people. \n\nMoreover, I think they lack some serious variety of crepes. There are only about 6 kinds for each of the sweet and savory crepe categories. And none of them specifically sounded appetizing to me. I ended up ordering one sweet and one savory crepes.\n\nGranted that it is very hard to screw things up with chocolate, this place has miraculously produced crepes that were too sweet and creamy for my taste. I felt a bit queasy afterwards. \n\nNothing was absolutely terrible, but the service could have definitely been faster. But would I pay $10 to eat at this place again? Probably not."

It's fairly quiet at this hour with the faux-Paris hallway with only a smattering of drunken tourists. The main dining room is closed, so you just walk up to the kiosk and order. Jamie and I split a $8.99 \"Favorite\" which was all sort of berries hidden under a large folded crepe. Lot of whipped cream, powdered sugar and berry puree oozing all over it (see my photo). In other words, it hit the spot. We sat in the dining area adjacent to the place and were perfectly content to discuss whether Cher has ever ordered one of these. \n\nCREPE - 3.5 stars...no great culinary art but it does satisfy a late-night sweet tooth \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...well, it's Paris...sorta \nSERVICE - 3 stars...they're pretty much on autopilot at this hour so don't expect frills \nTOTAL - 3 stars...so I was hungry at 11PM...so what?"

It was a hard decision between the wild mushroom and the shrimp scampi but I ended up choosing the shrimp scampi. It was amazing! The portion is reasonable but could've been bigger.

We didn't know where it was, so we asked the gentleman working behind the Players Club Desk \"where are the crepes?\"  Not only did he give us directions to the location, he gave us an \"Insider Tip\" card - personal handwritten coupon for us (buy a crepe, get a free coffee or drink).  Sure you think, free drink, no big deal.  Well, at $2.99 a drink, we were appreciative of the insider tip card!\n\nI have had crepes before - the best being in Vancouver, BC.  But here, in the end, the crepes were ok.  We got one of the salty ones -  the size was enough for 2 people.  I think they were unable to keep up with the volume of orders b/c the veggie filling inside was cold.  Don't expect mindblowing crepes, but do go for the ambiance of \"Paris\" or as a buffet alternative."

Right beside the bakery. And just outside the hotel elevators from your room. It is attached to the bakery and theres plenty of self serve seating.\n\nCrepes are made to order after lining up like any fast food joint. Except this place uses fresh ingredients and makes the crepes right after ordering. And you wait for crepe when your name is called.\n\nI had the monte cristo crepe. Its the priciest one but it caught our eye bc it was both savoury and sweet. It sounded odd at first but it actually was pretty good. The portions of ham and turkey were generous and the strawberry sauce was not overwhelming. It was actually pretty tasty and my son quite enjoyed it despite not being a fan of crepes. The toppings were generous and enough to satisfy you and not overly destroy the crepe. It was easy to eat and did not fall apart because it was stuffed full. The ingredients were all fresh and tasty.\n\nThe line moves quick and its very conveinent to have a fast food type option in this hotel. You can take your food to the little sitting area beside it or in the bakery.\n\nPrices are decent for the strip and I found the crepes large enough to feed 2. But Im not a huge overeater. Quality is much better than quantity. Made to order is the best part of this place. Made to order for less than $20 and it takes less than 15 minutes for your food. That is just right in my books and It will keep me coming back when Im in a rush or need a cheap bite in the paris hotel"

Even though it's early Sunday morning it's crazy here.  It's not a big surprise that the lines a pretty long although here they are not to crazy.  They have a good selection of savory and sweet crepes along with coffe and hot chocolate.  Since it's morning I decided to have a ham and cheese because who doesn't like ham and cheese. Along with water it's a pretty healthy meal.  The size of my Crepe was not huge but it was fairly big and full of ham.   \nAs we waited for our crepes I will admit it was a fairly long wait but hey its Vegas what do you expect.  After finally getting our crepes we looked for a place to sit.  About the only downfall to this place is the fact that that there are definitely  not enough places to sit.  We walked all around the area without a seat to be found. So we saw a tall table and decided what the heck let's just stand and eat.  I will say standing and eating can actually be good because I didn't feel as stuffed.\nAll in all this place for me was worth the wait. The Crepe was perfectly cooked with the right amount of food to get you going. I will be coming back\nAnd word of advice nothing in Vegas is quick so be prepared to encounter long lines and wait times. Also if you can have someone in party secure seating for you because not everyone likes to stand and eat.p"

On top of that, these crepes are delish!    \n\nWhat my hubby and I have done is order one salty and one sweet crepe and split them.  I believe they refer to them as meal or dessert crepes...just get one of each.  They are huge but you need to try more than one of these fairly inventive recipes.  I have not made it here on my last two trips to Vegas but Yelp just reminded me to go back and grub."

I just now saw that their website suggests you add ice cream or other add-ins/mix-ups, but these items/options are not listed anywhere around the venue.  \nC-they used processed meats in some of these...my ham and cheese crepe had sliced lunch meat in it--for their prices, and for a place that calls itself \"French inspired\" I feel that actual ham should be used. \nD-they really use brand name Nutella. There was a massive jar of it behind the counter. That disappoints me. Nutella is \"just ok\" to me..it is pure sugar. Why not try something like Justin's brand of hazelnut spread? It's different because of the lower sugar content. My grandma would say it's because we Americans are used to a crap ton of sugar."

There are some ups and downs to the crepes though. I haven't tried all of it, but if you like something that tastes like potpourri, then get \"The Favorite\" which is I think #1 on the menu. It's a combination of random fruits which over powers the crepe itself. I honestly don't like it :( If you want something as a dessert, I suggest you get either the Nutella, Chocolate or Suzette. I know for sure that those are yummy, but I have yet to try the others, so if you want to be adventurous and try something else, then hell, go for it! :) My last comment for the evening is.. the Fruits De Mer, also shortly and casually known as \"Seafood Crepe\" -___-.

However, there was no consistency on how they were spread out in the crepe. Half the crepe had a lot of Nutella and half didn't. I also thought the taste of the crepe itself was nothing special (it's something that I could make by myself at home). They also add these caramelized clusters of nuts, which was weird and hard to chew on. There's typically a lot of people so the wait can be a little long.\n\nI say if you're really craving crepes in Vegas then this place could be worth it but there are definitely better crepes out there."

They are consistently good. When in Vegas I have a crepe for breakfast, and another for a midnight snack.\n\nTips from a regular.....\n\n - They stop taking orders about 15 minutes before they close. So if when they close at 11 pm, you need to be in line by 10:45 pm.\n\n -  Order the combo. No matter the crepe's price, if you order a combo, you get the crepe and drink for 10.99. Depending on the time of year, the combo might be 9.99. The combo is a better deal than the rewards price. \n\n - If you get a soft drink or coffee, just ask for your drink cup, then go next door to JJ's Boulangerie, for your drink. The crepe window is part of JJ's, and inside JJ's they have a larger selection of soft drinks and teas."

But i can pick out some faults...\n\nThe boyfriend and I came here this past weekend, and were delightfully satisfied.\n\nI ordered the D'Anjou. Which is a sweet crepe, with Almond Paste, Pears, and walnuts, topped with caramel sauce. Now, when they say \"topped with a caramel sauce\" they actually mean: \"3 skinny lines of caramel, carelessly scattered across your plate and crepe\"\n\nIt was delicious though. The pears were canned, which at first, i was against, but then as i was eating it, i came the the conclusion that they were perfect because fresh pears would've been too hard. these still had a nice bite to them though, they weren't soggy. The almond paste gave a sweet, smooth, nutty blanket in the background.. it wasn't over powering with almond flavor.\n\nThe boyfriend ordered The Favorite. which was also a sweet crepe, stuffed with all types of berries (blueberries and strawberries come to mind, but i know there were more) topped with a berry sauce. It was very tangy, which complimented the sweet crepe perfectly.\n\nThe down side to this place, is the line. You order, and then spend 15-20 mins (depending on how big the line is.. more or less.) standing off to the side, waiting for your number to be called. Oh, and bottled water is $4 (for the small bottle) and $5 (for the bigger bottle.) \n\nThe crepes are about $9... so for both our crepes, and 2 waters, the total came to $30. Was it worth $30? No. Not at all. But that's Vegas... you're mostly paying for where you're eating, secondary is WHAT you're eating."

My wandering eyes betrayed the nutella and settled on \"banana\" and \"peanut butter\" and saw no alternative.\n\nThank you, wandering eyes.  If you could distill Beethoven's fifth symphony into a dessert, this crepe is what you'd get.  Ripe bananas bursting with sugar.

It is usually not clean, and most of the chairs are broken - many are mismatched extra banquet chairs.\n\nBoth times I have dined here recently, they have gotten my order wrong.  One time, they forgot one of the crepes, and were rather rude when we brought this to their attention.  The next time, they tried to charge us for two crepes even though we only ordered one.  Not sure why the staff here has such a difficult time taking orders properly.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that they charge for water.  I find it to be unacceptable service when I pay for food and tap water is not available free of charge.  Furthermore, if you are going to charge me for a cup, it would have been nice to give me a full size cup, rather than a very small one, which I had to refill multiple times.  I asked if I could have the larger cup instead, and the answer was a firm no.  I understand that they want it to be plastic, so that it is see-through, and more difficult to steal a drink other than water, but make it a bigger size.  This kind of nickel and diming is no way to treat paying customers and says a lot about why Caesars, which owns the Paris, is $25B in debt and nearing bankruptcy."

I had looked at the menu the night before and knew that I had to decide between a savory ham & cheese crepe and a more sweet blueberry lemon crepe.  That morning I was feeling savory and so I went over to find a seat in the seating area while my girlfriend did the ordering.  Due to that I don't really have much to say about the place itself since I did not see much of it.  My ham and cheese crepe came out to me looking nice and covered in a b\u00e9chamel sauce which I mistook as cheese.  The crepe was pretty tasty as ham was good and salty which paired nicely with the Gruyere and it quickly disappeared from my plate.  Whenever my girlfriend had also finished her crepe we started talking about ordering a sweeter crepe for a dessert of sorts.  My girlfriend decided to spoil me and let me have both of the crepes that I had thought looked good the night before by deciding to split the blueberry lemon crepe with me.  She once again went over and ordered and came back with an amazing looking plate.  The crepe was in the center covered in a berry sauce, blueberries and powdered sugar with a Chantilly cream on the side.  In the middle of the crepe was some lemon curd which gave the dish some sourness that worked really well with everything else that was sweet on the plate to keep it from being too sweet.  In the end there was nothing left as we both had enjoyed our meal.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  While I believe that it is a bit overpriced to enjoy on a regular basis, the food is great and it could easily be a nice little treat every now and again."

Its open all day so you can go anytime of the day to get crepes and I like that it has both dessert and savory crepe options.

The ingredients are very fresh and I like that they don't make the crepe until you order so you know the crepe is also made fresh. The service is very fast and it is a very large crepe. They also have juices and coffee, everything you need for a quick brunch or bite to start off your day. Its not a formal restaurant so the only tricky thing is that it doesn't have formal seating. It shares the seating area with other eating places around the area so once in awhile it might be hard to find a seat but the few times I've been there I've never had a problem.

We planned on walking the strip for a bit so asked what time they would be closing. She ignored us, did a couple tasks, then sharply responded with \"midnight.\" No smile, no other words, not even eye contact. Then, when we went back, it didn't get any better. She didn't say anything upon approaching the counter; just waited for us to order. We wanted a couple ingredients taken off of a crepe and she snapped back with it being the same price. We stated that we were aware of this and she instantly cut us off mid-sentence. I'm not expecting Disney World-esque customer service, but at least pretend you enjoy your job. I would say maybe she's had a bad day, but this is not the first negative encounter we've had with her and upon reading other reviews, other people have had negative customer service experiences as well. \n\nThe only other negative would be price. I'm not too concerned with this as we expect nothing less being on the Las Vegas strip, in a tourist trap. They running at about a 21% food cost which is equitable to a bar, not a cafe. Elsewhere, the exact same product would be closer to $7, we spent $10.50 per crepe. \n\nAgain, I would recommend trying their crepes. Just go into it expecting to spend a pretty penny and expecting a rude encounter."

I got the Soliel and asked them to add ham. Yes, it was $9, but it was too much for one person to eat in one sitting (in my opinion). So, given that you can get two meals for the price of one, I think it's totally worth it."

We ordered two Roasted Chicken ($11.00) which consisted of rotisserie chicken, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus, basil pesto & shaved grana padano. \n\nOverall verdict: pretty good. \n\nThe crepe batter itself was a little sweeter than I would've liked it, the tomatoes had a weird texture to them and the basil pesto could have used a little more \"umph\", but overall, not bad for a snack. \n\nIt was a definite plus that there were plenty of seating arrangements around and that water cups were free of charge.

The first one I got was great and the line moved quickly.  They had put creme on it which was delicious, even though at first I thought I wouldn't want it.  When I came back the next day they were understaffed and the guy making the crepes was moving ridiculously slowly, almost everyone was whining about it.  When I finally got my crepe I figured who cares about the 15 minute standing wait because it's worth it... It came out without the creme and I asked the cashier if they could put it on because they did earlier and she said no because it wasn't on the menu, which it wasn't.  So I don't know.  The first crepe was much better, the second one just had all the raw sugar and butter in one spot and it was too crispy in that area, honestly I didn't even enjoy eating that section but I was hungry."

La Creperie definitely meets the grade - in fact, these are the best crepes I've tasted since France.\n\nThe pancake part of the crepe has a wonderful thickness, it's substantial, not thin and skinny.  All the crepes I had: ham and cheese, three cheese, and the pear crepe - were fantastic.  My only regret is that I didn't have more opportunity to try some of their other crepes, before coming home to a comparatively crepe-challenged area!"

Our order was up in about 10 minutes and lucked out by grabbing a tiny table to eat at. Between the three of us (2 adults and a kid) 2 crepes were plenty filling.\n\nSt. Louis ($9.99) - imported ham and mozzarella and fresh basil with bechamel. The description mentioned imported ham. Maybe they meant imported from the local grocery store, because the ham didn't taste any better than what I get at Albertson's. The bechamel sauce was too thin and runny for my liking.\n\nToulouse ($9.99) - ground sausage, pepperoni, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, mozzarella, basil, topped with marinara. This was the better of the two that we ordered. Tasted just like a pizza. The marinara lacked the depth in flavor that would make it special, but was good enough to satisfy.\n\nThis might be a good place for a quick bite, but definitely not some place that I would seek out or ever crave.

So don't expect mind blowing crepes here. But if you think of it as fast food rather than fancy French pastries, you should be fairly content.\n\nThe prosciutto, gruyere, & b\u00e9chamel crepe was the clear winner for me. I love bechamel sauce when it's done right. This was not perfect, but for a fast food stand I thought it was better than I expected, and it paired great with the prosciutto and gruyere.\n\nThe spinach and artichoke with bacon and cheese was also really good. I generally have more of a salt tooth than a sweet tooth, so I wasn't surprised that I preferred the savory crepes over the dessert ones. \n\nIt's hard to screw up strawberry and chocolate crepes, and these were pretty good as well. But it's not real chocolate, it's Nutella. (I like Nutella, so this wasn't a bad thing, just not what I expected) But the strawberries were either over ripe or over cooked. Great strawberry crepes (in my opinion) have crisp strawberries laid in the crepes right before pulling it off the burner, so they are just starting to get warm, but not cooked.\n\nSame thing with the chocolate banana. It had overly ripe or over cooked bananas with Nutella. \n\nSo in my opinion, it's a good fast food option for the favors crepes, but if you want dessert, look elsewhere."

We ordered Bayonne and Napoleon Dessert Crepes. \nPortion is good to share with one person. Personally I rather have ice cream Crepes than just fruit Crepes. I don't like savory Crepes because it tastes weird. It's like eating something hot fruits. Well the reason why I don't like the Bayonne is because the pork tasted funny and it was full of cheese. A little too much cheese for me. For $8.99, I'd rather just get something else like a slice of cheese pizza. \n\nThe person who took our order was kinda rude. (not to us, but to the people in front of us) The family in front of us doesn't speak English, so they didn't know how to order. They had a difficult time pronouncing the name of the dish and the cashier was rolling his eyes and rushing them. How rude...\n\nI wouldn't come back."

Num!\n\nSince we were staying in Paris, I brought it up to the room, but forgot to get it 'to go'.  So I just carried the plate up.  While leaving La Creparie, a lady saw my dish and, with a thick French accent, asked \"Excuse me, what kind of crepe is that?\"  I told her \"the D'Anjou crepe\" in what I thought was my best French accent.  She didn't understand me (what can I say?...I took Spanish in high school  :P), so I translated for her and told her it was \"the pear one\".  Then in the elevator on the way up to the room, a French family was going up to their room.  They were all eyeing my crepe and talking about it in French, then asked where I got it from.  I let them know it was just downstairs.  Thankfully, they didn't ask me what kind of crepe it was because I didn't want to have to say the name again.  Who knew there were so many French people who fly half way around the world to stay at the Paris Hotel and eat crepes?!?  But I did a lot of free advertising for La Creperie with that D'Anjou!\n\nDownsides:\nLong wait?  Yes.  There's usually a line.  \nOverpriced?  Yes.  It's $10/crepe.  Pricey, I know.\n\nBut, it's Vegas.  Your paying for the atmosphere of enjoying a yummy Parisian snack along a sidewalk in Paris without having to pay for a plane ticket to Europe.  :)"

First of all, the concept of this place is perfect. It is located in Paris near the buffet. You can actually watch them make the crepes. In some sort of a way, it is almost like art. The lady with the long pony tail did not make it like art. I know there were a lot of people and she was rushing, but she was kind of sloppy and throwing them all together really quick. I think if she took her time a little more and put a little more love in making them, that they would actually be better. The best part about the crepes is the menu. You have sweet and savory options. I had the monte cristo.I would of liked more cheese that was melted, less turkey and ham, and a more flavorful bechemel sauce. I would of liked more powdered sugar and more micro basil. But, it was decent."

There wasn't much special about it and the berries weren't very sweet or fresh. And the service took a LONG time for just a simple berry crepe. They also mounded half of my plate with really heavy whipped cream, and although I'm biased because I only like whipped cream from starbucks, it was just bad whipped cream in general. The only good thing about this creperie is that for about $10, the huge crepe will fill you up, whether you get the dessert or savory crepe because they're both the same price there."

The sweet was the Napolean which had raspberries, blueberries and strawberries w/ some lemon custard and a delicious raspberry sauce drizzled all over.  Both were amazing and hella tasty.  \n\nIf you want a get away from the endless buffets in Vegas, you have to try this place.  The only critique I have is that service was very slow, it took them 20+ minutes to get my crepes out.  But regardless, it's worth the wait and just mouthwatering!"

The Fresh basil on top was a nice touch  The mariana sauce was cold when they put it on top of the crepe so it ruined the entire dish. :( This also made the cheese clump together faster, making it more dissatisfying by the bite. It had so much potential!!! I'm disappointed."

You'll get a decent sized crepe and can sit in a fake Paris ambiance. It's weird that you have to go to the restaurant next door to get water/utensils."

We went for lunch and had a wonderful meal - and one that was honestly too much food for 2 people. We got 1 savory and 1 sweet crepe and we could barely finish the sweet one (though we did it was so good).\n\n~ Caramelized Pear $10.25 caramelized pears, raisins, maple syrup, candied hazelnuts & chantilly cream. This was wonderful- sweet, warm, and the combination of soft pears and crunchy nuts was wonderful. One needs a tea or water to cut the sweetness after a while though. I think it would have been even better with peaches- which I seem to recall they used to have (I've been here before) but I'm not 100% sure on that.\n~ Ham & Cheese $11.45 parisian ham, gruyere & b\u00e9chamel sauce. WOWOWOWOW!! This was AMAZING! If you only have room for 1 crepe get this one. The meat  has a wonderfully smoky flavor and the gruyere is the perfect addition to the dish. The creamy and salty flavors mix well and leave you very full. \n\nFor roughly $20 you can be stuffed and spend the rest of your time walking it off in either the casino or the strip!"

            "review": "We went to Paris to hit up the Le Buffet for the crepes but the line was about a mile long. Luckily there was La Creperie located exactly across from the buffet. The price of $10 per crepe will at first shock you, but then you have to realize 3 things ... 1. this is Vegas; 2. the crepes are HUGE; and, 3. the crepes are delicious!!! My hubby and I ordered one savory and one sweet crepe and decided to split them. For the savory we got the (forge the formal name of it) cheese and prosciutto crepe. I had never had a savory crepe before, just sweet ones in the real Paris. The crepes are a bit thicker than the real things but they are very very flavorful. After taking my first bite of the savory crepe, I couldn't believe I went this long in life without having one before. All I can say is .... OMG Yum!!!! This is not a crepe I would recommend trying to eat on your own. It is to be shared. It is huge and very very filling. The next was the sweet crepe. We were already full but there was no way I was going to let this go to waste. We ordered the crepe with cinnamon apple filling, topped with caramel and creme. And, when I say creme I mean to say C-R-E-M-E. It's a wallop of real whipped cream; maybe a bit too much. It also melts quickly so be sure to not order it at the same time as the savory crepe. Next time we'll get up and order it separately. Anyway, back to the crepe. Again, yummy goodness! I had never had a crepe with apples before. It was like apple pie hooked up with a Frenchman. Perfection! Even though we were stuffed, we licked our plate clean. This is a definite must-visit when stopping at Paris Las Vegas. I look forward to it in the future.\n\nAdd'l notes .... seating is a problem. This is not a restaurant. Seating is available next door to the crepe stand but on a busy day, it can be tough to find seating. Have one person stalk out a table while the other is in line getting the crepes. While the crepes run $10 a pop, soda is about $4 and it's for a small ... very small ... 16oz cup. The drink prices are not posted on the menu so it's a bit of a shock when they ring it up and you'll be too stunned to say anything. There is no kids menu so when a child orders a crepe, they'll be getting the same size as an adult. Be sure to share!"

I had a savory crepe with prosciutto, basil, and that white sauce. the prosciutto was on the salty side but overall it was very yummy. The dough was a nice chewy texture. Also had the Napoleon which had berries, custard and whipped cream. Mmmmm custard in a sweet crepe is a must!\n\nI came here because I remembered in from five years ago and wanted to see if it was still there. Lo and behold, it was in the exact same spot. Warning: long lines in the morning--don't even bother with trying to find good coffee. Also, people are animals about tables...I went to touch a coffee to see if it was still hot --meaning the person was claiming the table...and she came pouncing with a squeaky 'excuse me but thats mine'....well well well....i was just checking, don't freak out or anything! anyways, i was the table holder and set myself down as soon as a party of 8 left. it was a big family. =P\n\nPrices were good for vegas we paid around $45 for 4 crepes. the sign says $8.99 per."

            "review": "When in Paris, do as Parisians do.  When in Paris Las Vegas, stop by La Creperie.  \n\nI come here a few times a year for a quick, casual breakfast.  Notice I didn't say \"cheap,\" because that's one thing it is NOT.  $8.99 a crepe is a lot of money.  I guess they have to pay for their charming location on Le Boulevard inside Le Casino.\n\nLa Creperie only offers food for takeout, although there's a charming seating area to the left of the stand.  Go with a friend and have him or her save you a seat.  The seating area is pretty small, and you might have to get creative about getting a table.  The crepes are made to order, so get ready to wait 4-5 minutes for your order.\n\nSince I have to order two of everything, I opted for two crepes: one breakfast crepe and one dessert crepe  They offer 6 breakfast crepe choices and 6 dessert crepe choices.  I went with a St. Louis crepe (pronounced \"sen-loo-WEE,\" like the Tampa Bay Lightning player, not like the city in Missouri) and a Peanut crepe (no pronunciation tips necessary).  \n\nThe St. Louis had prosciutto, cheese, basil and was drenched in bechamel sauce.  The sauce was thick, but a bit mealy.  Actually, now that I think about it, it looked pretty disgusting, kind of like milky cream of wheat.  The crepe was very tasty and filling, though.  The second crepe, the Peanut was chock full of chunky peanut butter and bananas.  I would have called it The Elvis (in loving memory).  The Peanut was very sweet, but it still made for a pretty good dessert.  It's not the best dessert crepe out there, though.  Berry and fruit crepes are much better.\n\nPiece of advice: skip the coffee.  It's too weak and taste-less.  I saw people walking around with Starbucks cups.  If I hadn't been so lazy, I would have stopped by a Starbucks before ordering my crepes.  Starbucks is not very Paris like, but . . . you know how they say that Seattle is the Paris of the Pacific Northwest?  Well, they don't really say it, but they could."
