But some have tried and called them to salty which i can understand.  to each their own. ( and more orgasmic fries for me)  \n\nUsually when i go i get the indian curry cause i'm an addict for spicy food. and man is it good but stupidly filling.  I walk out in a firy ball of food coma everytime i eat it."

The next time I go there she will be my server . I really noticed she did an excellent job at all her tables. Our server guy older gentleman salt and pepper hair. Not a good server. We ordered appetizers when we were serve them we did not have any plates to serve ourselves.  My friend had to get them . About 5-7 mins later he came with plates he turn right around he saw we didn't need them. He pretty much ignored us toward the end of the meal then he was trying to be as nice if he can be."

I think it is the open doorways between the restaurant, breezeway, and lounge. Smoke does come in, even though it is mitigated. Even my very healthy husband was coughing by the end.\n\nOtherwise the food is average quality. The hummus is a tad bitter. And they've switched from a good pita to one that is far lower quality. \n\nPositives would be the high number of vegan and gluten free options. Prices are also moderate/reasonable."

            "review": "This is one of my favorite places to eat Greek and Mediterranean food and I've been coming here since college (10 years!). I love that it's low-key, casual, but still a nice dining vibe with your significant other, friends, or family. \n\nHere are my go-to dishes:\n\nCombination Platter ($13.95): Hummus, Tabuli, Stuffed Grape Leaves, Falafel, Tzatziki, Baba Ganoush, and Athens Fries. It also comes with warm and toasted pita bread. This is a generous platter (as is all their dishes) of Mediterranean favorites. I love the variety and it has all my favorite things, so I don't have to choose or order too many dishes. I love their Falafel and the Athens Fries are one of the tastiest fries in town. Also, the dipping sauce that accompanies their fries is equally delicious.\n\nMoussaka ($13.95): Layered casserole of sliced eggplant, onions, potato, ground chuck, fresh herbs and spices, topped with B\u00e9chamel sauce and baked. Served with Basmati rice and house salad. We absolutely love the flavors of Moussaka. The herbs and spices with the wonderful meat, potato, vegetables, and the not-too-rich B\u00e9chamel.\n\nBroiled Kabob Trio ($20.95): Marinated Chicken (boneless chicken breast marinated and rotisserie broiled over an open flame), Lamb (top sirloin domestic lamb marinated with Moroccan seasonings and rotisserie broiled), and Koobideh (Ground beef chuck marinated with onions and spices; rotisserie broiled). Served with Basmati rice, Vermicelli pilaf, house salad, and fire-roasted tomato and red pepper. This is a HUGE plate with their most popular kabobs, so if you're like me and can't decide what you want, get a little of everything. All the meats are delicious and juicy. I also love they all have different types of seasoning. I prefer their Basmati rice (which is delicious), but their Pilaf is also good and I love that they're both offered on this dish.\n\nGyros Pita ($8.75) OR Gyros Salad ($9.75) OR Gyros Platter ($10.95): It's no secret that I love gyro meat, so anyway I can eat, I'll get it. All of these options are essentially the same - Gyros, vegetables, rice/pita - and it just depends on my mood. A sandwich (I love the fresh vegetables and Tzatziki sauce here), a salad (lose the pita for a low-carb option and you get a mountain of fresh vegetables) or a plate (rice and salad).\n\nService is always nice and we've never had any trouble with our food or bill. It's a bit away from us and their other location is a slightly closer, so we'll visit when in the area.\n\nThey sell their spice blends including the Athens Fries mix on location.\n\nAlso, Wednesdays 5-9PM is Customer Appreciation Night and it's 25% off your bill (dine-in cafe only)."

They have great music playing and everything I have ever ordered has been really good.\n\nLast time I ordered the GRILLED SALMON which was cooked to perfection and served with Mediterranean vegetables and Vermicelli Pilaf. (the Pilaf was delicious but the veggies were kinda weird... I would trade it with something else like the tabouli).\n\n-remember to ask for the mango chutney - it goes great with the salmon."

Judy sold us on those items. French fries were very flavorful. You have to love garlic to like these fries. The ice tea was tropical. I can't put my finger on it but it was refreshing on a hot october day. The first time I was there got the gyro. That was tasty and a huge portion. They're whole  menu portion is huge. This last time I went I had the ground beef kabob (Koobideh). It was really good. I ended up taking that back to the hotel. It saved me later that night when I drank a little too much. Over all really tasty. Judy was wonderful."

I even got several of my friends hooked on it!\n\nGenerally, I just order the dip as my meal but have also ventured onto their entree menu. I've tried their Broiled Kabob Trio, Chicken Parmesan and Chicken Pita sandwich. All entrees were pretty good. The meat is always pretty tender and seasoned well. Still not as delicious as the dip, though. Their Athen's fries and dipping sauce are quite tasty as well! Decent Hummus and Pesto Hummus. Their Saganaki was good, but sadly the serving was pretty small for a cheese lover such as myself. Extra points for the sizzling skillet it's served on though!\n\nService has always been great at Paymon's. As long as they keep that up and my delicious dip is available, I will be a loyal patron."

If you want, you can add hot sauce and spices made by Paymon's to your food. The your in the mood for Mediterranean food, this is the only place in Vegas that will deliver. If I wasn't on a health kick, the Athens fries would have been destroyed!!\n\nI've also been here a few times to smoke Hookah in the lounge side and have some drinks. Again, great hookah and service."

            "review": "Food is good, service is great sometimes but this is mostly about the hookah. Apparently there is a \"20 minute guarantee\" on smoking time according to one of the waitresses. Hookah for me at home or anywhere else lasts more than 20 minutes. The hookah I prepare or smoke at places like the Olive can last 1-2 hours. A refill to  Paymon's is when your charcoal runs out, NOT your shisha. So, if your coals are burning out, they will charge you for an entire refill even though your shisha is still burning fresh. This is the only hookah place that I know that charges you for a refill just because your coals run out. I've experienced this everytime I come here. Two of those times, the hookahs weren't prepared properly and were at fault to the person that prepared them and the waitress still insisted on charging me for a refill. Um, no thanks. A refill should be if your shisha burns out NOT your coals. Bottom line. What a way to price gouge you."

Inside decore was ghetto. Wobbly tables. Ordered the athens fries. Very good. The restaurant also has its own cayenne hot sauce, which was surprisingly good. The food came out and the portions are huge. I got the veggie platter that came stuffed grape leaves, falafel, hummus and baba ganoush. Everything was one note. Nothing stood out. Wife got the chicken kebab. The chicken was okay. The rice that they served with it was not okay. Tasted and looked old. Weird notes of cinnamon. The area surrounding was ghetto. Wont be coming back."

Was recommended to have Samir make the turkish coffee for us, but he was off today. Our waiter Anthony made ours and it was the best coffee I've ever had!!

I had the salmon kebab, which wasn't on the menu and the waitress was surprised because she said they definitely have it. When I got it, it wasn't on a skewer, so it wasn't really a kabob. It was just put on the plate in chunks and had a weird dark artificial-looking pink color. It was just OK, but not worth the whopping $17 something. The rice was good and I liked the cold cucumber soup. I won't be back though and won't be going by my friend's recommendations any more because we definitely have different taste buds."

I did take some bites of the kabob plate and the meat was tender and flavorful. \n\nThe waitresses know my friend since he comes all the time so they were good to us. We never had to flag them down to get drinks and they were over to the table ready to get a drink for any new person that happened to join us.

At our friend's suggestion, we ordered saganaki to start. Our server, Anna, was very attentive and very patient. She explained to us novices that saganaki is keflotori cheese. Wikipedia told me that is deep fried and then set on fire. Apparently, they used to set it on fire at the table but the fire department had some silly objection to that practice. So now it is set on fire in the kitchen. Even without the drama of the fire, the dish, served with really good pita bread, was delish!! Based on some Yelp reviews, we also ordered a side of the Athens fries as a side dish. OUTSTANDING!! They come with a mustard based dipping sauce, also excellent but not needed since the fries themselves were so tasty. For a main course I ordered the chicken kabob. It came with a special rice (very yummy!!) and a Greek salad on the side. The chicken consisted of large chunks of white meat (usually not my favorite) that must have been marinated in something that made them juicy and flavorful. The grilled veggies on the plate were also great. The portions were huge. The next time I come here (and it will be soon), I will share an appetizer and a main course."

All of the dishes were very good, fresh and in large portions. \n\nThe only reasons for not giving this place a 5 star review would be the amount of options on the happy hour menu and the minimal amount of seating available in the hookah lounge area which is where you need to sit in order to get the happy hour specials. I just wish their was an option for a small size gyro or meat dish too. That would just make everything perfect.\n\nOther than those minor set backs I'm very impressed and will definitely be retuning again soon!"

The pita bread tasted like as it was hand made the second we got there, the humas was delightfully tasty, the falafels we're cooked to perfection, the fries were extremely crisp and well seasoned... just everything on the plate was a good buy.  \n\nNo doubt will this place be part of my Vegas routine when I stop by in town again.

They also have great fries, gyros, pasta, etc. I wasn't much of a fan when I first came here a few years ago. But I've definitely grown to enjoy it. I actually opted for take out on my last visit. It was a large order, but it was prepared quickly and packaged perfectly. I think I've found my go-to mediterranean place."

The place is sketch as hell in some random little plaza across from another sketch ass plaza. However, this place does not disappoint. I ordered the athens fries and was not disappointed. Honestly, they were the best fries I've ever had (plain fries) they are drizzled with rosemary and seasoning salt and come with some kind of dip for the best combination since peanut butter and jelly. The athens fries are a must have. I also got the steak kabob plate (medium) with a side of gyro meat. I didn't eat all of these things, but I will say the gyro meat was excellent, the steak kabob was a little bit plain compared to the gyro but still good. The grilled veggies that came with the kabob plate were quite the surprise. Overall I would definitely recommend this place for mediterranean food when in the Las Vegas area."

I enjoy eating near the water fountain area because I feel the tables are too close together in the dining area where it's hard to hold your own conversation because you hear everyone elses. Try sitting near the wall.  \n\nLet's move on to food... using a 5-point rating:\n\n3/5 Shrimp artichoke dip with pitas. Pita had mold on it so look carefully. But the dip is flavorful.\n\n4/5 Chicken pita.  They have been inconsistant with the chicken portion and sometimes it comes out dry.  But the overall flavor is good and it's a good size...sometimes.\n\n5/5 Athen's Fries are great (seasoned with paprika, garlic and italian seasoning). It comes with with \"fat\" sauce, which the main ingredients are mayo, ketchup, paprika, italian seasoning, garlic powder etc.\n\n5/5 Baklava was good but a bit on the small size. \n\n4/5 Hummus was a nice consistancy and flavor, again, watch out for moldy pita bread. \n\nTip: Wednesdays are packed because you get a 25% off your bill."

I love to eat in the courtyard, but I had an awful experience with the late shift. I will let it rest with a simple statement about the inattentive and down right neglectful server. \n\nThe food is also better during the shifts I listed because you get the full menu instead of the late hour one which is limited. The biggest difference is that you cannot get rice with your entrees and they substitute it with hummus. Their hummus is not bad, but it is better if you ask for pesto to be put on it.\n\nMy group does not come here as often as we used to, with the exception of one, who makes it a ritual every week. Still, if you ask anyone what is a staple for every visit they will scream, \"CRACK FRIES!\". Listed as Athen's fries, but we call them crack fries, because the seasoning is as addictive as the drug. Not only do they generously coat it in this stuff, but they mix it into their mayo dipping sauce, and then place a bottle at your table. Watch out because you might overdo it on the sodium, if you are not careful. \n\nAnother dish that is worth trying is the tandoori chicken. It is cooked perfectly, although the seasoning is lacking. If you pair it up with the mango chutney, it is delightful. I personally prefer the lamb kebabs, they are juicy, and perfect, when cooked to a medium rare. I still ask for a side of mango chutney, but that is not due to a lack of flavor. It is just my obsession with mango anything."

Go back to doing simple, tasty Greek food and leave the Denny's menu alone.\nAs a side note the service I've gotten at the Maryland Parkway restaurant, the original, has always been better than the Summerlin location."

Paymon's was fairly close so my friend and I went in for a quick bite.\n\nWhen I dine with my gluten-free friend, the first thing we do is ask if they have GF menu items. The hostess said they in fact do! We settled down into a cozy table in a dimly lit dining room. Tealight candles illuminated the tables. The hostess gave us a laminated sheet that had a list of their gluten-free items. My friend noticed that the fries were on the list, but there would be a high chance of cross-contamination.\n\nAs we were just looking for a quick bite, we decided to order some hummus (served with cucumber slices) and veggie stuffed grape leaves (dolmas). I ordered the broiled chicken kabob to take home. The hummus was quite smooth and creamy, though I wish we had something else to dip with than the cucumber slices (carrots? celery?). The stuffed grape leaves were okay, I would have liked a bit more seasoning.\n\nThe server was friendly and checked on us often. I got my chicken kabob just as we were ready to leave. I didn't check the chicken kabob until I got home, which was unfortunate because I saw that it included the vermicelli pilaf. The server saw that we were ordering from the GF menu (it was just a list of menu items, no description). I would have liked for it come with just plain basmati rice, as I wasn't entirely certain if the pilaf was gluten-free.

Anyway, on to the food. Right now they are running an AYCE make your own pasta dish for $8.95. Now that is a sweet deal! I wasn't paying for my lunch, but I also didn't want to break the bank. I had the bow tie with garlic butter, and couldn't finish the entire portion (yes, I am weak, but hey it was a work meeting). The noodles were cooked well, and the sauce was good.

Paymon's is located a couple of miles off the strip so it was nice to get away from all the lights and hustle bustle for a change. At the peak dinner time the restaurant was empty with only two other patrons inside. It also felt very small like only a small section of the restaurant was open for dinner service (I'm not sure but I'm guessing there was a hookah section to the left which ate up some of the space of the restaurant making the open section look tiny). The lighting was also very dim which made for an intimate setting not a family eating environment.\n\nThe server who took care of us was very friendly and made the dining experience more enjoyable that what it was. Most people in our group got standard Mediterranean dishes like the Gyro Platter ($11.95) and the Chicken Kabab ($15.95) along with a side of fries ($2.95) and some kids pasta ($3.75). I decided to be a little more enterprising and got the Fesenjan ($13.95) on the recommendation of the server (he did mention that it was a sweet so in case I did not like sweet I should get something else). The wait for the food was very long. After 20 minutes we were just about to cancel our orders and leave when the first plate was delivered which was slowly followed by other orders.\n\nTaste-wise it was hit and miss with more misses than hits. Let's start with the good stuff. The Chicken Kabab was hands down the best dish served. The kabab was completely cooked through yet nice and juice. The rice and other stuff on the plate was also good. The gyro was hard and rubbery like it had been chopped up earlier and refrigerated and then was microwaved before being sent to the table or alternatively it could be that it was grilled for so long that it had become completely dehydrated and fit for the dustbin. The Fesenjan which is basically Iranian chicken stew made from pomegranate molasses and ground walnuts that give the stew a sweet and tart flavor, was by itself very good but the white rice in the center was almost raw like it had been hurriedly steamed and added to the plate. Maybe steaming the white rice was the reason for the extremely long wait but that's what my gut feel is as the rice that came with the Chicken kabab and the gyro platter was the flavored rice which was cooked right. Anyway it made eating that dish almost impossible and even tough I was hungry I could not eat more that half of the Fesenjan which was a shame as it was pretty good.\n\nOverall I was not completely satisfied with Paymon's. If it would have not been for the friendliness of our server I would have rated this place only 2 stars. I'm not sure if I will return."

I really wanted dessert but there was no way. I was too full. From hostess, waitress and busser. It was all around friendly service and deliciously huge portions of food."

I couldn't even tell what  cuisine they really serve! The menu had Italian, Greek,  Persian and Lebanese  items on it so I wasn't sure what meal was gonna work best. I ordered the \"koobideh\" since they named it the Persian way and expected it to be a Persian kabob plate. What I received was a \"non cooked at all\" Arabic kabob. I wish it looked as good as some Arabic kabobs! It clearly had no resemblance to Persian kabobs and was so pink I got sick looking at it.  As I'm pregnant I had to send the food back to cook my kabobs longer. Our server could not be found for 10 minutes so my husband went to their kitchen to find someone and we were told they will remake mine and send it back. I waited for 25 minutes while our family ate their mediocre food. We received the bill and I asked the server to either cancel my food or pack it to go. She had no idea where my food was or anything. She brought a food back with her and gave it to me with no bag or silverware. We asked them to call a cab for us and she said: please wait outside for your cab. This is in Las Vegas! In the heat! Not welcoming at all. Don't go there if you want good food and a knowledgable server that can explain your options to you."

Pretty simple and awesome concept, considering flavor choices at other hookah places can be hit or miss. It was $7.50 for a hookah, but we opted for the $10 \"frozen\" hookah, containing a gel much like the stuff found in those frozen cups that keep your beer cold. \n\nThe atmosphere is lush and exotic feeling, and they played great classic rock.

It had a good 30-40 minutes left in it!I knew the price was too good to be true. That's my only gripe about the place.

There are two locations and, although the Sahara site is \"fancier\" I actually prefer the South Maryland Parkway location.  It's in this strip mall by UNLV Medical Center (that's how I found it but that's  a story in itself...)  It looks very unimpressive from the outside and, frankly, I would NEVER have gone there in the first place had I not been scouring the path from UNLV to my hotel after 10 PM at night--STARVING! My sister and I entered the building desperately hoping to find SOMETHING-----ANYTHING!  \n\nWhen you enter the building, it looks like a very basic diner of sorts--not fancy...but look to the far right and you will see a wall you will need to dodge in the event of an earthquake!  It is LOADED with plaques, articles and other kudos.  Zagat rated, this little hidden gem is an unexpected  surprise if you are not a local \"in the know!\"\n\nPaymon's caters to may tastes...Vegetarian...non-vegetarian...picky eaters...there's something for everyone!  Their specialty is Mediterranean food--and it's awesome!  I love the appetizer plate with all vegetarian selections.    Not caring for grape leaves or spanikopita, I used to request more falafel and/or hummus as substitution but they did not flex at my last visit.  The flexibility for substitutions has changed over time so I can't tell you if this is set in stone but  I suggest you complain if they don't allow \"tradesies\"--maybe Paymon will change his mind!!!\n\nThe lentil soup is a great start.  And if you pair the appetizer plate with their vermicelli rice, the combo may just be enough to feed two people!  If you or someone in your party does not care for Mediterranean food (yes, it really DOES happen, however hard to imagine!) then there is always...pasta.  I'm not kidding.  And their pasta is, remarkably, very, very good.  It took me five years before I ever tried their pasta because I adore the Mediterranean selections.  However, someone in my dinner party opted to try the pasta and everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed their \"just a taste.\"  \n\nAfter dinner, you should check out their cappuccino...a world traveling friend of mine remarked with astonishment that it was THE BEST cappuccino she had EVER had!  Quite a compliment indeed!\n\nIf you step through the restaurant past the restrooms and into an enclosed courtyard, you will see a door to a \"Hookah Lounge.\"  While I can't critique the H Lounge because it's not my thing, I can tell you that the decor is cool and the place is hopping as the night progresses.\n\nI must say the service is very good.  I met with Paymon over lunch many years ago and we talked about his business model.  He seems to attract and retain top talent because the wait team really is very good.  At the time, his compensation package was above industry standard and included profit sharing and this translated into a team that takes ownership.\n\nLast, but not least...price!  The food is reasonably priced for the quality...and if you go on a Wednesday between certain hours (look it up), you will enjoy \"Customer Appreciation Night\" which is a whopping 25% off your whole ticket! \n\nBut I must WARN YOU of ONE THING...just ONE VISIT to Paymon's and you'll probably find yourself in a COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP of food, service and affordability,  We've been seeing one another for nine years strong now but hey--at least there'll be no paternity suit!"

I do have a few good things to say so let's start with that. \n\nThe food was great. We had the Athens Fries, and Dolma appetizers. My friends also had the mozz sticks and said they were good. I was totally impressed by the Dolma dish. Tender grape leaves stuffed with angus ground beef, tomatoes and rice in a tangy tomato sauce. I've been craving them ever since! The fries are delicious too. Coated in some kind of seasoning with a side of this creamy aoli sauce. That sauce you could put on tree bark and I would be good. Great happy hour deals 50% off all appetizers and signature drinks. The Lychee Martini was pretty good as well.\nThe hookah flavors were great as well. We tried Blueberry Vanilla with a touch of cinnamon... Tastes like French toast so amazing! Ill be coming back specifically for that. \nNow into the bad... Unfortunately this completely out weighed the good. First, I say down I'm the hookah lounge part for about 25 minutes with no menu, and no recognition at all. I finally went up to the bar where the waitress was and asked if she could stop by. She held up her finger and said one minute in a very snappy tone. Mind you the lounge was not that busy at this time. I sat back down and about 15 minutes she came over after I waved my hand at her. I ordered a glass of wine & asked if it was on happy hour, she said yes. The rest of my party arrived a few minutes later & we all sat there for about 30 minutes with no service. And still no wine for me. One of my friends approached the bartender to order the rest of our drinks and he said they would be brought out to us. After waiting 20 minutes and seeing our drinks just sitting there on the bar I got up and brought them over. When I was at the bar retrieving them I told our waitress we would like to order. She got out a pen & paper and said what would you like? I was t sure of the exact order everyone wanted so she told me to go ask them and she would be at the computer when I was prepared to order. Now in all the years of experience of dining out or working in restaurants in general I was blown away by this. She actually wanted me to go get the order of our table and walk back to the bar to order. While taking my drinks as well. Wow, not cool bro.\nThe hookah chic was no help either. She kept forgetting the flavors and had to ask us several time what we ordered. And to top it off I had 6 glasses of wine over the period of our 4 hour dinner and when we got the bill not one glass was offered at happy hour. When I asked about this, this was her response \"oh I didn't ring up any of your wine until the end and it's 10pm now.\" \n Such a disastrous experience. If the food  wasn't so amazing I'd never return but since it is ill give Paymons one more shot. But if I receive service like this again my next review won't be as nice. Get it together people!"

Maryland Pkwy.\n\nMy favorite is their fries! I love just coming and hanging out with friends after a long day for some fries and beers. It's seasoned perfectly and delicious and definitely something I get every time I go to either Paymon's locations.\n\nAnother item I got was their fried calamari, which was surprisingly pretty good as well. It was seasoned perfectly the couple of times I got them, but it's just your average calamari.\n\nThe broiled ground beef kabob is delicious, it just left my mouth watering for more and I would always try to eat it all in one sitting, but end up taking some of it home for a snack later which still tastes amazing! It's never overly cooked and always seasoned well and has a savory taste to it. \n\nA safe choice always is their gyro platter or sandwich, it's just a typical gyro and isn't too special, but if you're unsure what you want it's always a good back up plan!\n\nWhen they have the all you can eat pasta, it's a always a great deal especially when you're with friends and are unsure what to eat for dinner that night. You might as well! \n\nOverall it's one of my favorite places for mediterranean and one of the top contenders for best in town. I haven't been to another place that's as good as they are yet, but I'm looking!"

We were pleasantly surprised to find they were open and serving food.  \n\nWe were seated in a quiet location within view of the hookah lounge.  The staff was attentive and helpful with explaining the menu.  The restaurant had a Persian flair and a romantic feel.  My husband and I felt like we were on a date.  It was nice.\n\nThe menu had various Mediterranean flavors - Greek, Persian, Italian, there was even Indian food on the menu!   Being familiar with Persian food and seeing this was probably their strength, I ordered the Koubideh plate.  My husband ordered the gyro.  The portions were huge and the food was delicious.  My husband liked the food I ordered more than his own.\n\nWe loved this place so much that we will be back to try more of the menu. I can't wait to visit Paymon's!"

This may sound odd, but I was put off by Stephano's down the street who was closed on a Saturday when I attempted to try them for the first time. Luckily Paymon's was located right down the street.\n\nI put in a to-go order with the very congenial hostess when I arrived. They had just opened, but as I waited for my order, what seemed like regulars streamed in at a decent pace.\n\nFor my husband and I -\n\nAn order of Athens fries - a HUGE portion with oregano and other flavorings peppered all over, and it also came with their very distinct fry dipping sauce which I loved.\n\nTwo gyros - these were amazingly large and actually served for our lunch on Saturday and our lunch on Sunday as well. I was so pleased with how big these were and the amount of meat allotted to each. The meat was also succulent and delicately flavored. Of course I had mine with tzatziki sauce which was heavenly. My husband opted for his on the side and actually ended up dipping his portion of the fries into his. \n\nI would definitely recommend Paymon's. Their food was beautifully done, full portioned, and the wait for my take out order was mere minutes."

I understand that the primary business of this place is a restaurant so again, I must reiterate, this review is for the hookah lounge of Paymon's cafe only.\n\nThe service is ok. My friend and I were greeted at the front desk. However we were directed to go towards to two other doors before we can even reach the hookah lounge. It would have been fine if we were escorted, but we had to find our way to the other side of the restaurant to reach the actual hookah bar. Once we actually got to sit, we were greeted by a woman who carried flavors of hookah and asked us what we wanted. I notice that the tobacco that they used are not of the best quality. Most of it are dried and some of it were mislabeled. As someone who has been smoking hookah for several years and have been to several Nargile bars all over the Middle East, I know what to look for. Our server was very attentive and we got our drinks and appetizers right away.\n\nOur hookah came minutes later. First of all, I am not sure if their staff knows how a hookah works. The rubber seal on our pipe was so loose that air was escaping, thus not getting the air necessary to get a full smoke out of the pipe. I knew this, but I am not sure if their hookah preparer knew this. He kept messing with our hookah till I finally told him why it wasn't working. I told him very tactfully what needed to be done and he was able replace our hookah eventually. I also notice that they use the cheap Chinese made ones, not the good kind (Egyptian, Syrian, Persian, etc) but I am sure its for cost efficiency. The worst part of this place and thus why I am only giving it 2 Stars is the simple fact that THEY DON'T REFILL CHARCOALS. Charcoal service should be standard in all hookah bars. If I've had my charcoal changed every 15 minutes at a Hookah bar in downtown Bagdhad, why not in Las Vegas? Are they too cheap to have this service? All the hookah guy can do is adjust the air valve, which btw does not do anything to the charcoal. The charcoal will keep burning till its completely turned to ashes. \n\nIf you're in Vegas visiting or a local, I DO NOT recommend this place at all. I gave it two stars because of the service and that is it."

I was given a gift certificate and enjoyed the opportunity to try out a new place for free. \n\nMy friend and I had a veritable feast, sharing a beef/lamb sausage entree with rice, pita and three different dips, Athens fries, and finished the meal up with baklava. We were so stuffed that we had a meal and a snack out of the leftovers later. \n\nThe tzatziki was amazing.  I love any kind of dip, so the hummus and the baba ganoush were welcomed. The baba ganoush was smokey, unlike any I had ever had. I stuffed my face with what seems like several pounds of deliciousness over the next few days. I loved trying different bites of different things--fries, pita, sausage--in the different dips. Definitely worth the five stars alone!\n\nIt did get a little spotty with service, however. We arrived at 7pm with nobody else in the joint, and then it all the sudden got slammed, and our table was in the crossfire of forgetfulness. It was no matter, though, because we were so hungry and filling our bellies with the deliciousness of Paymon's that we didn't care!"

Typical order is yogurt cucumber dip for the app, which I could eat for my meal. Another standard meal is the gyro salad, the gyro meat is perfect, not tough or greasy and the salad dressing is so flavorful. Or if you feel like fish, try the Greek salad and add a salmon filet, omg so good. Not sure what secret spices they use on their salmon but man I love it. A great Persian dish is the fesenjan, it's an acquired taste, and not esthetically pleasing to the eye, but it's rich with pomegranate flavor and other spices, and the rice is cooked to perfection (the rice here is probably one of my favorites in town). I stepped out of my Mediterranean box tonight and had the falafel pita and I was very disappointed, very dry, not tasty at all.  And to finish dinner, try the rice pudding-so good. I'm not a huge fan of baklava, but I have to say it's pretty good here as well. Oh and the iced tea! How can I forget the iced tea! I usually drink a gallon when I'm there."

Its only ever kinda good, or good for the price, or the atmosphere but never have I heard, or said, \"Outstanding.\"\n\nOutstanding is barely appropriate for my first experience here. Interestingly enough, I searched \"Delivery\" on Yelp, and this Paymons came up high on the list... Strange, because they don't deliver. Which is fine, i like living in Las Vegas and being able to drive around our beautiful city; driving down Maryland Pkwy at 30mph is excrutiating, but worth it when you get here. Its neatly kept in a non descript mini mall across from Target and Buffalo Exchange.\n\nThe food was beyond excellent. There was an interesting sauce that came as default chicken sauce that just made me... I dunno, not my cup of hummus. But the white tzaziki is incredible. Great consistency and not watery or over cucumbery. The chicken is tender and marinated all the way through. The kabob (kubideh) is meaty and well seasoned. My only gripe is if you get it in pocketed form, its all meat on top and salad underneath. Im going to try wrap form next time.\n\nThe Athens Fries are beyond phenomenal. The only fries in the entire world that I gladly munched on cold. I was floored and full and satisfied for under 30 bucks and didnt even touch the Greek Salad yet. The best takeout experience I've had in Las Vegas across any genre of food. There is a lot of competition for pita and kabob and hookah, but with this visit and this experience and this food. This is my only choice."

The addition of the \"athens fries\" was surprising but they were delicious too, especially dipped in the hummus or tahini hehe!  Even though it's a bit pricey, I wouldn't hesitate to go back here again."

There's also Moroccan and Lebanese beers available, which is far more exciting than the usual Blue Moon/Newcastle offering. And they're only slightly more expensive than domestic beers. \n\nFood-wise, I've only ever had their chicken dishes (kabobs and the like) and I thought the meat was well seasoned, moist and tender. The rice is always a little bland; I find myself making vigorous use of the salt and pepper shakers. \n\nFor night owls, the hookah lounge next door has a great late-night happy hour, perfect for that 2am mixed drink to top off your night (or your sobriety)."

However, he eventually got us seated, and our server, Anthony, made sure to make up for any misgivings I had. My wife ordered the combination platter, and I ordered the Gyros platter. The portions were HUGE - I normally don't have leftovers to take home. I liked it at first, but, the more I ate, the more the salt content got to me. By about halfway through the meal, I got an idea of the sodium intake of your average bukkake star. My wife assures me that it was perfectly normal for Greek food, so I'll chalk that up to my inexperience with going Greek. The vegetables served alongside, though, were magical. I greatly enjoyed those - giving me half the rice and twice the veggies would not have been a bad idea. \n\nShe liked almost everything on her plate except the dolmas - they were extremely bitter (even for grape leaves), and the consistency was like pudding, rather than rice. Other than that, though, she loved it, and was very happy with it.  She also truly enjoyed the lentil soup she ordered.\n\nWe'll be going back."

            "review": "This is a two part review. \n\nThe cafe portion of Paymon's is actually quite nice, and is the only reason one should patronize this business. The food overall is delicious, with a variety of Mediterranean with some American fusion and South Asian cuisine rounding out the menu. The Athens Fries are without the best French fries I've had at ANY establishment, so they are a must get when going. Otherwise, the rest of the menu is fairly consistent in quality (not necessarily authenticity) and should be experimented with. The gyros, pastas, kabobs and curries have all been worthwhile dishes to try in my opinion. Lastly, the cafe has some great ambiance, especially during lunch time, with plenty of natural lighting and well-done decor.\n\nPaymon's would be worthy of a 4 or a 5 star review if only the cafe were being reviewed. Unfortunately the attached hookah lounge prevents that. Simply put, Paymon's serves some of the worst and most overpriced hookah in the city. It's actually appalling how bad it is, given the quality of nearly everything else about the establishment. First, Paymon's uses molasses, an extremely inferior alternative to sheesh a tobacco. Flavors are weaker, and the amount of smoke produced is pathetic. This goes hand in hand with absolutely mind-boggling decision to use instant lighting charcoals. The charcoals are of very, very low quality and burn out easy, which is why Paymon's uses a metal cover to insulate the heat of the coal, a practice that typically results in burning the bowl. The ultimate kick in the groin is that despite using coals that are low quality and burn out quickly, additional coals are NOT free, when practically every other hookah lounge will give you at least 2-3 coal refills, if not more on request. Overall, despite the ambiance and food menu, the lounge is definitely not worth it if you were expecting a good hookah experience. Stick to the cafe."

Let me get out of the way that you are coming here for the food and the food alone.  The actual restaurant isn't fancy or in the best part of town. I've been here several times and they always take forever to greet you when you walk in. Move on because the food is worth it. \n\nMy favorite starters are the pesto hummus and the Athens fries. My mouth is watering as I type this. Their hummus is perfection to begin with, but the pesto topping just takes it to the next level. The Athens fries are loaded with a savory seasoning and served with an addictive sauce on the side. \n\nI order the same entree every visit. That is the gyros platter. This is definitely enough food for at least two people. The lamb is thinly shaved and full of flavorful. The rice is my favorite because it contains pine nuts which is a nice addition and really adds to the flavor. The house salad is yummy and covered in plenty of traditional Greek dressing. When I came here for a work dinner we all had different items and everybody was happy with their dishes."

We walked in and Ahmed felt that he should school us on the signage about the right place to stand to be seated,... Scolding us both as he seated us. Properly chastized, we were greeted by Anthony our server. We ordered the combination platter (which I have ordered just this month, 3 times) to be told that a mannequin sized serving of taboulis is normal, and if I want more I will be charged. Then he proceeds to argue with me, in front of the tables of strangers around us watching. I then asked another server for a manager, and was told they didnt have one....Excellent customer service! After I have almost finished my meal, Anthony brings me a tiny plastic sauce cup of taboulis, and says, if I bring more I'll have to charge you. It seemed to have a \"creamy mystery sauce \" floating on top. I didn't touch it. HORRENDOUS customer service! BAD manners, and self importance are not good skills for a server, which was reflected in his tip. We are typical 20% and uppers, but not this time. We will never come back. Horrible experience! Don't eat here if you want to enjoy yourself. There are tons of restaurants that have great food, and excellent customer service...Let's support those establishments."

Probably not the best place to go with such a big group of people (we had about 12) since the table space can get very cluttered and passing the hookah pipe over can be a game of twister.\n\nHuge (I'm talking like 50 flavors no joke) selections of hookah flavors can be a bit overwhelming, but I love the fact that we can mix and match them however we want.  I thought choosing a hookah flavor was tough, try the tea menu!  They also have a pretty decent selections of wine plus beer, a full bar, they have it all!\n\nI had a plate of combination appetizer which was delicious, but I wish they gave us some pita bread so that I could've cleaned the hummus, baba ganoush and other flavorful things that were on that plate.

The food is all pretty decent, but none of it seems to be particularly well-executed. And then the bill comes. Now, it's not like this place is super-expensive or anything like that. But it's not cheap, and in the end, I'm never happy with what I've paid for.\n\nNow, the hookah lounge is a bit of a different story. It's marginally comfortable (at best), the service is usually super-friendly, and the hookahs vary wildly in quality. Hookahs only last an hour, and that's if you're lucky, since they don't replace coals. And the cost is about $15. Most other establishments will get you about 2x as much smoking time for the same money. The big redemption is daily happy-hour. 5-7pm, including weekends, gets you half-priced hookahs and a bunch of appetizer and drink specials too.  At half-price, everything is instantly reasonable and worthwhile. Drinks, appetizers, hookahs, etc. Also, while it's not a very comfortable place to lounge and smoke, the decor and atmosphere is usually pretty decent.\n\nI rarely come here to eat anymore, and hardly ever show up outside of happy hour. Everything, from the decor to the food, is just \"pretty good,\" which to me is not enough for what they charge. But happy hour in the hookah lounge definitely makes the place worthwhile. \n\nPRO-TIP: No hats allowed in the hookah lounge. Take yours off first so you won't look like an idiot."

It's probably not the best Mediterranean restaurant in Vegas. But somehow, everything I've had has just been extremely satisfying.\n\nOn this visit, I shared a few dishes with a friend. We had their Baba Ghanoush, a bowl of Cold Cucumber Soup, and a plate of their Chicken Curry. I've been thinking of cold soups lately. Cucumber Soup isn't quite what I had in mind - I was thinking something more along the lines of Vichyssoise - but it was pretty enjoyable and I couldn't stop eating it for some reason. The Baba Ghanoush was excellent. Not that I'm an expert. I didn't even realize it was made of eggplant at first. And then there's the curry. I'm a sucker for good, heart-warming curry. That's probably a strange way to describe curry, but theirs just has a \"comfort food\" effect on me. It's probably nothing special as far as curries go, but I love it nonetheless. And as always, I washed my food down with their delicious Passion Fruit Iced Tea.\n\nOverall, I'd have to say that good food, nice ambience, and great company combined to make this a five-star experience.\n\np.s. Customer Appreciation Night on Wednesdays 5-9pm - 25% off your entire bill! I appreciate being appreciated."

Apparently food from the cafe is available, but you'd have to be seriously stoned to want to eat here. And since the staff simply will not load the hookahs with hash, that is unlikely to happen.\n\nThis is primarily a locals hangout, as it's somewhat off the beaten path. The Lounge is a long, narrow room, swathed in red fabric. An upholstered banquette runs along each wall, giving the impression that you are at a hookah smoke-off. The hookahs are attached to the tables, in order to prevent some sort of misadventure, I suppose. This also allows the placement of colored LEDs beneath each hookah, so the color changes as you smoke. Trippy, dude. The tables are surrounded by tuffets. Yes, just like that used by Miss Muffet. The seating places you close enough to the ground for intimacy, but not so near as to cause leg cramps. The decor is something out of an absinthe-fueled fever dream. In addition to the swags and gold cords and velvet tuffets, there is every painting of a harem or odalisque known to man. It is as if an art historian specializing in 19th century Romanticism went on a shopping spree.\n\nThe Hookah Lounge is primarily about two things: tobacco and alcohol. Call it what you may, flavor it with apple, cherry or chocolate, it is still tobacco. The drinks match the tobacco, in that they are sweet and colorful. I had a Tanqueray and tonic, because I'm mean."

Their fare is solid, though not spectacular. They have a variety that can appease even the most finnicky or allow one to feel adventurous. They are open late and they have a decent turkish coffee, which for some is a substitute for sleep. \n\nService is hot and cold, normally good, but one or two of the waitstaff could stand a stint in rehab.

I got the bowl of lentil soup sans cheese and a falafel pita with hummus and fries. Matt got the unlimited pasta bowl, and his first round was bowtie pesto. \n\nService was alright although our waitress was a total ninja and disappeared a lot so if we actually did need things it would have been very difficult to find her. \n\nMy food was very good, although I think that the soup is a bit overpriced but still very yummy. I'm not a fan of their hummus at all but when it's wrapped inside the pita it's good, and the fries are always bits of pure heaven. Matt however, wasn't a fan of his pasta and had half of the big bowl left. He still wanted a second bowl of something different, and asked if I could take the rest of the pesto home as leftovers since he didn't like it. The waitress said due to policy they can't box up the first round of pasta. \n\nOkay, I would understand if Matt didn't completely finish his second bowl and kept asking for to-go boxes, but come on. I can't believe that they just wasted all of that food that I would have gladly ate for lunch the next day. They need to change the policy that you can only take home one portion or something. That policy just totally puts me off from coming back as soon as I usually do. \n\nOverall the experience was alright but wasting that food is upsetting. I guess from now on we won't be so adventurous with our first bowl. The food is always good usually though and the service is alright (although I can tell you a funny story about a waitress who kept blindly spilling water on my friend throughout the night - too hilarious) but I don't think I'll be back for awhile."

And when it's time to leave, I get a fresh to-go cup.  I have been coming here for years (16 to be exact) and my bladder never fails to get maxed out.  Paymon's is one of the few places I can think of that still brews this brand of passion fruit flavored iced tea.\n\nBut the pee tea isn't the only reason I come here.  It's also the Athen's fries.  Yup.  I eat fries at a Mediterranean restaurant.  But these ain't your run of the mill fries.  They have a crazy tasty seasoning and a dipping sauce I could pour over everything.  I have tried a lot of the menu items with some hits and misses.  However, I always fall back on my reliable favorites: gyros salad, lebni, hummus and baba ganosh.  And I used to love stealing some of the buttered noodles from the kids...until they stopped leaving leftovers.  \n\nBesides the food (and tea), they open up the hookah lounge at night and are open till late.  I've only been to the lounge about three times, but it's a decent spot.  Reasonably priced drinks along with access to the entire menu can make for a looooong night.  The only downside IMHO is that they use a cheaper hookah tobacco that doesn't last as long, burn as evenly and isn't as strong as the higher-end stuff (Starbuzz, anyone?).  An apple bowl would be a nice option, but they don't even offer it.  And they could be more attentive to the coals, though I guess that's irrelevant since the tobacco doesn't last very long anyway.  Regardless, like I said, it's decent.  And I don't come for the hookah.  I come for the tea.  And I run for the urinal."

I expressed it was my first time at Paymon's, & he did an excellent job to explain & guide me through the menu.\n\nPurchasing the felafel pita, it was the only item I was going for until my server offered me to test out their famous Athen's fries. While french fries are often redundant & boring to myself, I have to say Athen's fries are quite possibly the greatest fries I've EVER had! The seasoning with the side-sauce for dipping compliments each other so finely I had to hold myself back from scarfing the fries down before the pita. The felafel pita itself was delicious as well.\n\nI'm interested in returning here again to try out more of their dishes, since the atmosphere & the flavors of seasoning they use in their food truly won me over (as well as the attentive service I got!)

If your going to take someone's order that has a few particular requests (i.e. crispy athens fries, xtra sauce, etc.) and not write it down, no problem, your awesome, but when the food does come, and wasnt to order, and it was like talking to wall, then yea, im a little peev'd. \n\nThe grapeleaves have been and will always continue to be, a store bought product (I believe wild oats store bran from a jar) and are the worst you could ever want to eat, I mean, if you like mush and all. The rest of the combination platter lacked lemon!!!!! Come on Paymon's, your serving mediterranean food, put some damn lemon on the food, had to ask for a side of lemon, then it was just edible.\n\nAsked for the Lamb cooked medium, came to us \"well done\" No self-respecting person would ever eat Well-Done lamb. Oh by the way, I even question whether it was even lamb or beef, I honestly could not tell, and you lamb lovers know what a distinct taste lamb has, it was very difficult to tell if we were eating lamb or beef, but either way, it was tough as hell, so who cares at that point.\n\nSo out of the three or so food servers who were serving us, Not One of them EVER asked us how anything was, not Once, ever, nor did we recieve a thank you for coming in from our server Tammy.\n\nHere's a tip (because you know this was the only one you recieved from me) if your going to work in customer service, you better have a clue (or get one fast) what it is you are doing, it does go a long way.\n\nI know I couldnt do this type of service, too many a$$holes to deal with, but some people can do it, and they love it, I applaud you, otherwise, please, find another occupation.\n\nI did bring our experience this trip up with the manager very politely, there is no need to be rude or mean, just pointed out all the shortcomings of this trip, and stated that there are too many other business competing for business, and customer service (you know, the good kind) goes along way in my book.\n\nNeedless to say, wont be going back to Paymon's Las vegas anytime soon, will seek out other mediterranean establishments till we find a good one again\n\nFOOD: 5/10\nSERVICE: 2/10\nPRICE/VALUE: 5/10"

Chicken Fesenjan - WOW!!! and I don't even like chicken. \nBaklava: Walnut and Pistachio filling - very authentic ingredients. However, it was soggy, and not enough honey.

I didn't know that, just went on the day by chance! \n\nThe fiance and I shared several things. \n\nCold cucumber yogurt soup - the serving was good and it was nice and cooling. It wasn't very cucumber-y though still decent. I liked the crushed nuts and raisins in it. \n\nKoobideh plate- it was a bit dry, but the seasoning was pleasant on it. If only it wasnt overcooked it would have been tasty town. Rice, grilled tomato pepper and salad were standard, but good. \n\nCombination platter - the hummus I liked a lot, tsatziki and tabouli was good, the babaganoush was a bit too smokey, stuffed grape leaves were standard, their falafel was really crispy if you like it that way and their fries had a pretty yummy seasoning on them and were crisp yet soft inside still.\n\nThe portions were really generous. The koobideh came with twice was much meat as most places. Overall I enjoyed the food here even though there were a few execution misses, but I would eat here again. I used to go to the Sahara location quite a bit when I first moved to Vegas, but it's been a minute.\n\nThe thing that made the experience a bit less was the service. I'm a pretty forgiving judge on servers, but we didn't get drink refills and our server was often not in the dining room to flag down. I got a to-go box from a busser. When we asked for the check, she went to check out on other tables, took a table behind us order and then realized she didn't bring it and went to get it. We were gonna pay with card, but realized she wasn't anywhere again so we just paid with cash between us so we can go. I can wait for food, but when I'm trying to leave is the only time I get a bit impatient with being held hostage. \n\nThe experience is exactly 3 stars, pretty middle of the road. I may try it again though at the Sahara location as I'm rarely ever down here."

            "review": "What we ordered (ranked from best to worst):\n\nAthens fries - These were really tasty.  They come with the Paymon's special seasoning (more about that in a second) and a dipping sauce that tastes a little bit like thousand island but not as relish-y.  I usually only really like shoestring fries, but even though these were medium cut, they were so crispy that I still gobbled them down.  The seasoning is SO GOOD - it has like ten thousand ingredients and tastes a little bit like old bay but without the background shrimp-y flavor.  If for no other reason, you should try this place just to try that seasoning.  You can buy it there and bring it home with you too, to sprinkle into your mouth at your leisure.\n\nHummus and baba ganoush (sp?) - they have a comp dip plate for 6 bucks, and we chose the hummus and the baba. It comes with a side of pita.  The hummus was okay (not bad but nothing special), but the baba was really good.  \n\nGrilled salmon mediterannean platter - I'm not sure if this is what it was called, but this was pretty much just grilled salmon (really tender and not overcooked), with this \"vermicelli pilaf\" thing which was pretty much seasoned yellow rice, and a side salad.  The salad had lots of cheese on it, so if you don't like cheese be careful.  \n\nCombo kabob platter - 3 kabobs - lamb, beef, and chicken, + the vermicelli pilaf (see above), and some sort of rice pilaf + side salad.  The rice pilaf was really good - it's a mix between white and yellow basmati rice.  The lamb kabob was SO GOOD - the lamb tasted like the gyro lamb meat that you get at the good halal carts in new york.  The beef was okay, though a bit chewy, and chicken was pretty tender.  \n\nTiramisu - We actually didn't order this, but the waitress gave it to us for free since she felt bad about having us wait so long for the check.  The tiramisu is homemade, and has a bit more rum flavor than most of your average tiramisus, and is pretty good.  I think the baklava is also supposed to be really good, although we didn't try it.\n\nThe main thing about this place (besides the magical spice seasoning) is that the portions are GIGANTIC.  I think one of those platters could easily feed two people with big appetites, no joke.  Given the portion sizes, I think the prices are pretty decent.  Also, they have one of those cool dessert trays (like the ones you see at steak houses) that they bring around so you can see all the desserts on offer.  And our waitress was really nice.  And that spice....mmm."

If you don't smoke hookah, the happy hour is ridiculously amazing and the food is SOOO yummy. I love the Pesto Pizza and Athens fries! Good quality for a Good price. The drink menu is pretty great too! HOWEVER, this one time I went to Paymons (April 2012) I was with 6 other people and all but 1 of us were over 21. We wanted to smoke but the 1 guy who was under 21 was not allowed in the lounge area where you can smoke. We asked to speak to the manager and no exception was allowed since the bar is in the lounge area. Pretty lame since he was NOT going to drink or smoke, just came to eat in the lounge and watch us smoke. In anycase, just be aware its 21 & OVER for happy hour inside the lounge/smoking inside the lounge/drinking inside the lounge. Oh and happy hr is ONLY given inside the lounge : )"

I had forgotten how late they stayed open and felt like I was keeping the servers, but when I asked them they laughed and told me they didn't close until 1am (this was a Thurs.) and to take as long as we wanted. Very nice and they checked in appropriately. We all split the vegetarian sampler of baba ghanoush, hummus, tabbouleh, dolmas, really great falafel, lots of olives, and fresh slices of tomato ( I may be forgetting a few items). It was all drizzled with olive oil and served with warm fluffy pita bread. Oh I forgot to mention the best part...Athens fries! Served with various dipping choices. It was great for the 3 of us, perfect for sharing. Next we decided to share the moussaka meal and the spanikopita meal. The spanikopita meal came with a yummy sort of vegetable stew and a really good salad of romaine, tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese with a tasty dressing. The moussaka meal came with the same salad and a big mound of rice. They were both soo good we had forgotten how full we were from the sampler and over stuffed ourselves! We've been coming here for what seems like forever, I don't know exactly how long they've been open maybe since the late 80's as I remember my mom taking me when I was young. Either way it's delicious and just writing about it makes my mouth water :)"

On top of it all, the server looked like she didn't know how to set up the hookah. We addressed the issue to  Christin (server) but she said we'll have to buy another bowl. We just asked to change the charcoal since it's not even producing smoke. We looked around and none of the hookahs were working. Food seems to be ok but honestly, it was my first time trying this place and will never go back again. I came in looking for good quality hookah but all I got was disappointment.

In fact, I have been there multiple times since. I prefer this location to their other location in W. Las Vegas. It is more authentic, in my experience.\n\nThe highlight of Paymon's is definitely their deserts. Their kataif and baklava are out of this world. I like their salads as well. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is great--I like the dim lit place with Mediterranean paint on walls. The staff is always friendly and although this restaurant is usually packed--the staff remains engaged and not overly stressed.\n\nThe only draw back--I am not very fond of their Greek dishes here. Some of the hot dishes are not necessarily bad, just bland and average. But, I usually try to go for the usual--baba ghanoush, humus, pita as appetizers and salads as entrees, and am very satisfied.\n\nAfter hours dining happens at the adjacent huka lounge, which has a very ethnic atmosphere without much smoke permeating the air. It is not overcrowded either, unless you come on a Saturday night.\n\nI recommend this place for affordable Mediterranean place. Don't forget to try the deserts and the Fatoush salad!\n\nP.S. The adjacent Mediterranean market is awesome! I love all the ethnic foods I can pick up there for very affordable prices!"

We didn't quite know what they meant by \"atrium\", but we're adventurous, so that's what we chose. It's a dining area that looks like it was between 2 buildings and they enclosed it overhead with glass. There was a door to the kitchen and a door to the hookah lounge which was the building \"next door\". The decor is kind of dated looking, but what pleased me so much was I got to enjoy the feeling of dining al fresco without melting in the heat!\n\nWe ordered the flaming saganaki, a very salty super oily delish cheese that is lit on fire to crust the top. It was very good and I felt like there was enough of the warm pita slices served with it. Sometimes I feel places skimp. We also ordered Athens fries. They were super seasoned and I wish I had more room in my tummy to stuff them all in! Loved them! My husband and I both ordered the gyros. The meat was perfectly seasoned, the tomato and onion were very fresh and crisp, and I thought the tzatziki was perfectly tangy and plentiful. They make their pitas every day. The gyro was HUGE! And I stuffed myself. I'm talking sauce all over my face and contented noises coming out of me!\n\nThe kicker for me was we told the server where we were from and compared our fav Greek place in Denver to Paymon's, which proved to be much better. After a pleasant quick conversation he went for our check and came out with 2 slices of baklava, packaged to go (no styrofoam!), on the house. While my husband doesn't like baklava, both of us were charmed. I love places that know how to create loyal patrons who spread the word!!!!  We will definitely return!"

It is the basic stuff, no shorts, sandals, tank tops, hats, etc. Well two of our group had hats on and we were told immediately we had to remove them, no problem.\n\nUpon sitting us down and taking our order we noticed not one but two people wearing baseball hats similar to ours. When we asked why we were told because they are girls and the rule is for guys only. After a quick trip to the bathroom I noticed that in fact the sign says only \"no hats\" \n\nSo being a bit of a jerk I asked again why the double standard. I was told the rule is for guys and if we don't like it we can leave. I asked to speak with a manager and they sent over this lovely british or aussie lady that was unnecessarily rude stating that they have had gang problems so no hats for guys. Apparently there are no hookah loving female gang members...\n\nWhen I pointed out that her sign didn't say only guys can't wear hats she became irate and asked the two hat wearing non-gang member ladies to remove their hats. She then returned and said \"there, now no one is wearing a hat, are you happy?\" I told her I would have been happier if she acted in a professional manner and not like a child. \n\nOur actual waitress tried her best but the experience was ruined and we will not be back.\n\nI wouldn't expect people to stop going here based on my experience over the silly hat rule, however you may want to skip the hookah bar with an admitted gang problem, something tells me their sexist no hat policy won't keep them out lol."

The kitchen staff whistle as they cook, and since the kitchen is visible (and audible) from the dining room it made me want to not come back. I would definitely order take out, but dining in whilst being tortured the whistles of cooks, no thanks. \n\nFinally, the interior lighting is a bit odd. Overall the 'cafe' (indoor seating) is super dim, but there are random spot lights distributed throughout so there are super intense bright places and super dark places on each table.

This dish was very fresh tasting and the ingredients were good quality.  My better half had the Falamus pita which has always been my favorite.  This is a falafel pita with hummus, lettuce and tomatoes.  You must get the Athenian fries for any meal.  They are seasoned so delicious and also come with this amazing dipping sauce that will have you licking your fingers for more.  \n\nI was surprised to see they offered Italian, Greek, and Middle Eastern dishes. They are also connected to the Hookah Lounge which can be a nice and relaxing place to enjoy a few beverages."

I had to go back in the restaurant to ask the hostess to bring our check after standing up outside for a few minutes waiting.  \n\nStill, the food was great, and the taste was there...so we will be back to try their famous french fries :)"

Following the directions we make a walk that deems us awkward through the restaurant just to get to the host.  We say we want hookah and they point us back to our starting point.  I ask a random worker about hookah and they point us to another room that is actually to the left and said we can just go right in.  (Whats up with the misleading sign?)  \n\nAfter sitting down we wait for 10 - 15 minutes just to get a menu.  another 10 minutes for the order to be taken then after the order was taken, we wait another 10 to 15 minutes for the waitress to come back and asked what we ordered again.  The place wasn't even busy.  \n\nThe Hookah and drinks come out and I was really disappointed by the quality.  Really basic sub par quality that you can DIY at home.  Cheap Egyptian style bowl with the basic lid literally straight from a discount smoke shop.  I was hoping the Hookah wouldve been good since it IS a hookah lounge.  Not to mention probably the worst selection of early 80's music available.  Fans and doors were wide open as well so no chance of blowing o's are doing anything with the little hookah smoke their hookah's produced.  \n\nIf I didn't know about hookah I guess it wouldn't have been super bad just okay and nothing special."

Yes, he has done so well, he has been able to open 2 more locations; this being his first.  \n\nThe food is flavorful and delicious with the perfect balance of seasonings.  The service is fantastic...perhaps it is because the staff are all \"long timers\"...you see, the staff at Paymon's are also part owners, so they WILL take care of you.  Your business, is their business and they love what they do..and it shows.  Just look at the awards that line the walls. Those aren't all of them...they ran out of wall to post all of them.\n\nSeriously, you can't go wrong on whatever you order.  There's a side room that they fill with overflow from the restaurant.  It's called the Hookah Lounge.  If you have a penchant for the Hookah...visit the Lounge portion in the evening."

She made me a Bloody Mary with paymons spices and it was just as savory and spicy the way I ordered it, and consistently delicious. Julia and Brian show their professionalism with regal style and efficiency. I also like the Tabouli with quinoa. It is my favorite salad, but the gyro salad is a close second. The curry they have is also a great take on the dish. I am a curry fan and the unique take on the dish keeps me coming back as I cannot find its equal. I will end with saying thank you to Julia again for that amazing Bloody Mary, her continued efficiency, and her beautiful smile. Of course I will just tell her next time I go in."

It has a beautiful fountain and tons of plants and trees. It's just like your eating outside. If you go into the hookah area of Paymon's it is very dimly lit with lots of plush seating. Since it was happy hour (starts at 5pm) I went to the bar and ordered us a couple of drinks. I choose the Lychee Martini and Joel had a Mai Tai. Both drinks were very tasty and mixed perfectly. Not to mention excellently priced due to happy hour!\n\nAs far as food goes we shared both the Athens Fries and the Baba Ganoush which came with warm pitas. We both loved the sauce that came with the Athens Fries. Don't be afraid to try the Baba Ganoush. Even if you don't like eggplant, you really might like this. It's like hummus, but better! I also asked for some cucumbers to use in the Baba Ganoush. \n\nWe also both ordered the standard gyro with lamb and beef. I loooove the taziki sauce that comes in the gyro. I could totally slather that all over the whole thing!! The meat was garlicky and had great flavor and the pita did not fall all apart when I picked it up. \n\nService was beyond wonderful. They were very attentive and always kept our water glasses filled. The bartender even was nice enough to bring our drinks out to us in the atrium. \n\nWhat a great experience! Great food, wonderful atmosphere, tasty drinks and a supurb staff! When you are craving Mediterranean food make sure you check out Paymon's!"

I seriously feel that this place will close down in the near future. \n\nMy brother and I made the mistake of referring to GPS, rather than Yelp. We had lunch on a Friday afternoon. I liked the aesthetics, but SERVICE was POOR. The food reflected the poor service. I ordered the lamb kabobs for $16 not including t/t. The lamb was dry and rough. The dish had an Italian twist, which really took the authentic flavor out of the food. \n\nService was the worst I have encountered in quite some time. There were about three small parties while I ate there, and about 5 servers. WTF were they doing? Certainly not checking to see whether the meal was ok, nor refilling drinks. I had to walk the bill up to a server that gave me attitude.  Also, there was an annoying teen (possibly owner's daughter) running about. \n\nSuggestions to the owner- Close shop or offer decent prices (happy hour), take the Italian out of the Mediterranean equation, rehire new staff (David K was our server- nice, but just delivered food), eliminate dishes that are not popular, and offer complimentary Hummus and Pita. Btw, I want my money back!"

In this restaurant, I feel absolutely comfortable whether I'm going by myself for a bowl of lentil soup and a book, out to dinner with the guy, or with a group of friends.  \n\nI love sitting in the indoor courtyard between the dining room and hookah lounge.  I spend a good ten minutes everytime I'm there trying to read the script that lines the walls at the ceiling.  I sit back into my comfy sofa and relax --it's usually much quieter than the dining room.  If I'm with a group, the sampler platter is a staple--excellent hummus, loads of the best pitas I've found in Vegas, great olives, the fries with Greek seasoning, baba ganosh, falafel, stuffed grape leaves, and plenty of tzatziki sauce.  The three dip platter is a great option too.  I seriously recommend the hummus, yogurt cucumber dip, and bouranni...also served with all the delicious, fresh pitas you can handle.  \n\nTheir lentil soup is to die for.  Their falafel and tahini sauce are addictive.  Guy loves the gyro pita, which is HUGE (like as big as my head huge).  Now they even give the option to have your pita wrapped instead...but how could you say no to those pitas?  Plus, pita means the paper bag, and you should always \"Protect yourself, keep it wrapped!\"  Sometimes I get the \"falamus\" pita--falafel, lettuce, tomato, and hummus instead of tahini sauce.  Of course, NOTHING is complete until it's properly doused in their super yummo Racy Red Sauce--their house blend of spices, vinegar, and tabasco.\n\nI am terribly sad they closed their market down.  I had just decided to buy a hookah when I went in one day and it was gone.  BUT, no market means expansion which means more tables which means I never have to wait to be seated!\n\nOh yeah, if you really want all your teeth to fall out of your head, you have to try the baklava.

Our server was apparently doubling as a bartender as well, because I saw her behind the bar.  There were several servers who stopped by to check on us and service was freaking fabulous.  Even better, we were that group with a crap ton of credit cards, and our server took care of it without any issues.  \n\nI tried the Athens fries and Calamari.  I had the fries at Bite of Las Vegas which is why I wanted to come here in the first place.  It was NOT just the beer talking at Bite of LV.  These fries are good! Calamari was okay.  I had a bite of my friend's hummus and found it to be pretty bland and a little runny for my taste.  Overall, I loved the vibe of this place.  Will definitely come back!"

Today's service was on the slow side -- maybe the back to school business lunch people surprised the staff?  Anyhow, I ordered a cup of the lentil soup -- wonderful! -- and a side of the Athens fries (French fries with \"Greek\" seasoning).  Fries = comfort food to me and are pretty hard to mess up, so of course I inhaled them.  I like the casual atmosphere, the large number of vegetarian options, and relatively inexpensive prices.  Perhaps not the most \"authentic\" place to get Mediterranean food, but it's cheap-ish and reliable and generous with the portions."

Lets make it clear this is resraurant owned by a Persian guy and yet he does not know how to make his own food, how the hell are you going to maintain the rest of the stuff that are none Persian.\n\nA) I waited 25 minutes for my food with nothing on my table!!! When you eat Persian food as soon as you get in they will need to bring you warm bread with butter with mixed vegtables and onion this is a must at the table. After getting deinks Then the server needs to ask you if you would need any salad, yougurt mix (cucumber or shallot) and then get your order. Kind of like how they bring you tortilla chips at Mexican food before you wait for your food.\n\nAfter a long wait and my moms complain to Anthony the food came, I dont know what word to use but it was garbage and I mean litterly garbage. Tasteless, spiceless crab with premium pricing.My sister only ate the salad from her koobideb friends order was supposet to have white rice but it came with a garbage brownish mixed rice so they brought him another plate of white rice also servers learn your job chicken is always served with lemon on the plateand make sure it is not burned. My trio had dried, seasonless koobideh with burned chicken along with half cooked koobideh.\n\nAnd the combination plate was another disaster, flavorless tastless stuff. We didnt eat a good portion of the food my mom said its not nice to be wastefull so she brought the food back for our little dog coco and guess what even coco did not eat the food she only ate the meats lol.\n\nI found this place by doing a google search and they had two locations so I figured it must be good, oh boy I was mistaken. A note to everyone going here, if you are eating here you do not know what kabob should taste like and keep in my you are eating the worst kind possible. So do your self and your body a favor and go elsewhere"

My friends and I are regular patrons of the place, for good reason, they have good hookah. But this location certainly misses the mark in it's customer service. \n\nOur server Cynthia, (we actually had 3 different people tending to us, but this one in particular was the one servicing our hookah) addressed our table as normal and began conversation by telling us she hopes she gets over this sickness soon, a throat infection no-less. Fine, that's our prerogative if we wanted to smoke after that. But not wanting to make her feel bad, we chose to do so anyway. \n\nWe came in only for happy hour (5-7) for the prices. We ordered one of our hookahs 45 minutes before the end of happy hour and it did not come out until 5 minutes before happy hour was over. We could have smoked and ordered another bowl in that time. Cynthia apologized and said there was a mix up with one of tables, that was the reason for the delay. So, when we finished that hookah, I asked Cynthia if she could put this next order as happy hour pice being as their in up prevented us from doing so. She said she'd need to run it by her manager. So she did, came back, and said that was fine. \n\nWhen our bill came, it was not at happy hour price... we waited another 20 minutes for someone to come by so I could address this, and no one ever came. I went up to the bar to speak with Cynthia, or anyone really, and when she saw me come up to the bar, she quickly went off to the back. So I ended up speaking with another girl and she said the manager discounted $4 (not happy hour priced) at this point we were just tired and defeated and ended up paying for it. But I'm leaving this review here for others to please be cautious of Cynthia... \n\nAgain, I enjoy Paymon's, but will specifically be requesting her not be our server."

I stopped in for lunch yesterday a little after 1 pm, hoping to beat the lunch rush. The inside dining area was only half occupied. The hostess disappeared to seat a party of 3 and didn't return. Finally, a young man, still chewing food, emerged from the kitchen and showed me to a table right next to the hallway to the restrooms, which was heavily trafficked. The waiter didn't show up for what seemed like an eternity. When I was about to gather my things and leave, he arrived.. After he delivered my order (cup of soup and side of Athens fries), I didn't see him again until I happened to catch his eye over by the counter separating the cooking area from the dining room. He came to the table, dropped the bill and fled. I work nearby and have a limited time for lunch. I usually like to quickly check the bill and hand the waiter the money in one contact event so I can leave. But waiter had vanished. As I was about to take the money to the front, he reappeared. The entire experience took about 45 minutes. As a single diner with no one to converse with (and ordering just 2 small items), that is far too long. Were the wait staff eating their lunches in the back? Had they run down the street to see Lady Gaga? At any rate, if I do return, it will be strictly for take out. The owner was recently quoted saying that if construction on light rail on Maryland Ave. was approved,, it would ruin his lunchtime business. Instead, he should worry about his servers ruining it."

The people are great and the food is wonderful to almost every sense... beautiful, aromatic, and not that expensive!\n\nThey recently added italian food and surprisingly it is very good. Generally, jack of all trades = master of none, but apparently this wasn't far enough a stretch for them. \n\nThe reason they got 4 stars instead of five is for two reasons... one is that they used to have a fantastic \"best in the world\" falafel recipe. It was the best in any city I've visited. Unfortunately, they CHANGED IT. The falafel is now bland and pseudo-tasteless. You eat it for the sake of eating it and not for the sensory experience it was before.\n\nSecond, they have some ridiculous policies... for example, they do not accept take out orders after 8:00pm even though they are open until 1am. I assume this is because they are trying to mitigate \"friendly fraud\" ordering, but if you're a regular customer and you're willing to hand over your credit card, THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.\n\nThird, one night I called and asked what time they closed. They said they were open until 1am. I drove 1/2 way across town to get there only to have some newbie tell me that they don't accept orders after 12:15... (would have been excellent information before I drove over!)\n\nAnyway, with the exception of the falafel they have now, it is a delight! Still one of my favorite places. I only wish I could give it 5 stars.\n\nUPDATE 2.19.2010: I continue to dine here and the food continues to be excellent. Had a wonderful amazing server the other night. I wish I had gotten her name because she deserves mention here. This makes up for this older blonde lady server who works nights and is unattentive and rude to the point you want to punch her in the face. The falafel is still severely lacking compared to the fantastic recipe they used to have. I was wrong before when I said it was now pseudo-tasteless, because it is not pseudo, it is full-on tasteless (LOL). Also, I should mention that their hummus and kabobs are excellent."

I've had the spanakopita (?) and the falafel pita sandwich here before and they were pretty good actually.  I almost caved in and chose the falafel but I noticed that they still have the AYCE pasta going for $8.95 so I went with that instead.  So much for going out of the box right?  They have a good selections of noodle types and pasta sauces so I had myself a few bowls and left happy.\n\nALSO make sure to grub on some appetizers if you're extra hungry.  The athens fries and the spinach-shrimp dip are killer!  They serve their fries with a sweet mustardy spiced dip (not sure what's in it but it makes good lunch convo to try and speculate) and pita bread with their spinach dip, which is a nice touch instead of the usual chip and dip monotany.

Hands down these are some of my favorite fries ever!  But who goes to a Mediterranean Cafe for French Fries???  Me.  Okay, I also enjoy the other food!  \n\nOn this day I ordered the traditional lamb Gyro in a pita (not the pita pocket).  Paymon's gyros offer the best combination of ingredients.  Plenty of veggies, just enough sauce, and just enough meat.  I couldn't eat the whole thing, it was too big!\n\nAs some others have said in their reviews, the Passion Fruit Iced Tea is a big hit for me as well.  I LOVE their Lentil soup - simple but flavorful and served with a side of pita.  \n\nPaymon's does not have \"Lunch Specials\" and a typical lunch here can run about $15.  If you want a cheaper gyro meal, you will have to go elsewhere.  I prefer to pay the few extra bucks for Excellent service, clean and ambient restaurant setting, and for good food!"

The pita was definitely NOT stale, and from what I have tasted of my children's and wife's food, the Italian was admirable.\n\nMy one issue with Paymon's is that on a few occasions, the service wasn't consistently attentive.  Many times we have had exemplary service from the wait staff.  On more than a couple instances however, we were made to wait longer than I would prefer for refills, the check or appetizers.  The few blemishes on otherwise phenomenal service are the only things keeping me from posting a perfect 5 stars.\n\nUltimately, I am indeed a fan and absolutely think that Paymon's deserves a glance for an excellent off the strip dining experience."

I am the former, but I feel confident that I can bring friends or family if they aren't willing to venture too far outside of their comfort zone.\n\nFirst, I always always always get the dip plate: Hummus, Yogurt dip and Baba ganoush. It's so delicious I'm salivating just writing it out. \n\nLunch options, I love getting the greek salad with gyro meat or anything with their delicious french fries. This past time that I went for dinner, our waiter recommended the Fesenjan dish (chicken dish, pomegranate + almond(?) sauce). It was so delicious that I ate every single bit of it and now I want to go back and ask that waiter to marry me.\n\nEven if the customer service was crap, I would still go back for the yummies, but luckily, everything else is on par for them, too. They also have a great selection of spices to buy if you want to try some new flavors in the kitchen."

I cannot wait until they find a replacement and I doubt she will be here much longer. \n\nI love Paymons and I will always come here whenever I am in town, but I cannot wait to order a Maccallan 18 and cheers to when she is fired. \n\nCome on down and have an awesome time!

I think it's just because it's turned into a bit of a comfort food place for the mildly discerning local.\n\nI've tried almost the entire menu here and I've found that the things I like the most are those that are probably tried the least.  For those that forget that Italy is considered a Mediterranean country, don't shy away from their chicken marsala.  It's surprisingly good, even if the penne marinara served with it isn't the most harmonious of pairings.  The chicken fesenjan is tangy and refreshingly different, and the pastitsio (kind of a middle-eastern lasagna) is hearty, filling, and perfect for a rainy day.  Their Athens fries really are tasty and make up for the often disappointing hummus and questionable falafel.\n\nThe ambiance of this place makes up for its culinary shortcomings.  Sit in the courtyard if you can, it's a completely different experience than the dining room.  The fountain, which would seem gaudy in its size other places, fits in well among the couches, pillows, rich fabrics and stained glass windows of the Hookah Lounge.  Move on over to the Hookah when you're done with your meal - it gets even better over there."

My food is usually waiting for me by the time I get there (my office is only like a mile away!)\n\nWhat I don't like: the prices are a bit high for the portion size and quality.  At almost $10 for a sandwich, I should be delighted and/or stuffed afterward.  Also I hate that their Athens fries are ridiculously delicious, forcing me to either order them and eat them all (when I'm trying to eat responsibly) or not order them and want to cry.  They add some magical addictive spice to these perfectly cooked crispy potatoes that makes me love them and, probably like Joan Jett would feel if she were on a diet, hate myself for loving them.  \n\nMy go-to orders are the falamus (falafel and hummus) wrap and the fattosh salad.  Sometimes I'll get the baba ghannoush, I'm a fan of that as well.  Limited vegan options, but decent (not great) enough.\n\nGood happy hour in the hookah lounge, with half off drinks and apps! Downside: other than takeout, service is usually SO SLOW, and lunch takes 1.5 hrs if you eat in with more than one or two people."

My friend picked me up downtown and we had plenty of time for dinner before I caught my flight back to the DMV. He suggested Italian, and took us to a nice local place with the word \"Amore\" in its name. One problem - we forgot it was Valentine's Day. After opening the door to a huge crowd and a room full of heart-shaped balloons, we immediately turned around and discussed plan B. We joked that we were each other's Valentine's date, and then he asked me \"Do you like Greek?\"\n\nOff we went to Paymon's Mediterranean Cafe. The large restaurant is cutely decorated and, like most Greek restaurants I've been to, they pack the tables a bit tightly. The front of the restaurant features an array of spices and blends that are related to the Paymon's franchise and are used in the restaurant. Despite the \"holiday\" crowd, we were able to walk in and grab a seat.\n\nMy friend insisted that we start with an order of their Athens Fries. It's basically just seasoned fries with a sauce - a bit boring I thought, but I trust his judgement. And WOW, I can see why these are called \"award winning\" fries ... their house seasoning makes them the best seasoned fries I've ever had, and the house dipping sauce was a nice accompaniment.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Moussaka. I get it at just about every Greek restaurant I go to, and use it as a \"litmus test\" of their food. This was right up there with the best I have ever had. Beautifully layered, and the b\u00e9chamel sauce was outstanding. My friend ordered the Gyros Platter and it was so massive, and looked so tasty, that I almost had buyer's remorse. Almost.\n\nThe meal was a nice cap to my vacaton, and I'd be happy to make a return trip on any future trip to Las Vegas."

Fair warning - it is a club / lounge atmosphere.  \n\nWe started with hummus and pita bread, at $5.95.  The chicken pesto panini ($9.95) was excellent, and as always the Athens Fries are so good that we get one order per person, because no one wants to share.  \n\nThe Gyro (around $11.95) was also delicious, though it had (in our opinion) way too many onions.  \n\nService was good, not great.

I'm 34 but guess I am getting younger.  The staff are mixed bag.  I always see somebody new in the hookah lounge. All of them look under 25 and seem like they hate their job. This is typical doucebagy Vegas server attitude.  When I called the general manager to complain, he never returned my call. \n\nSo, where is Paymon? I bet he does not eat here. He probably doesnt even know they serve those broiled kabobs. Somebody should call Gordon Ramsay before its too late. This place sucks."

The restaurant was freezing cold and we had to keep our sweaters/coats on when I asked waiter if they could adjust temp I was told no.  We ordered Athens fries appetizer....took about 20 mins to get it but it was very good.  We ordered chicken shizkabob. ..great presentation...but chicken was really dry. For $16 and this many yrs in biz the cook should be able to get it right.  There's a place up on s eastern that has delicious moist kabobs for half the price.  When the waiter asked how it was I told him and he could've cared less.  We ordered wine w our meal but it came almost at the end.  I finally asked another waiter and then our waiter passed by our table and said \"you'll get your wine as soon as the bartender pours it\".  The wines were not very good.   I sent one glass back.  For dessert she had chocolate cake just ok.  Nothing special.  Semi dry.  When the bill came..the only thing delivered w any diligence or expediency...i showed the wait or that we had a free birthday cake email certif. And he grabbed the bill like he was ticked off.  I was truly sorry I brought her there because although she was ok with the food...the service ruined the dinner.  It's no longer a favorite place and with so many other options.. don't need a waiter that doesn't care to ruin our dinner or a cook that needs to learn to cook meats properly."

The problem was the bread was not very fresh, and my suspicions were confirmed when some was sent home with us, and it molded 2 days later even after being kept in a sealed zip lock container.\n\nThe part that really set me off was the service we received. We tipped well, but we were treated poorly for no reason at all. We came here to kill some time before an appointment we had, and at the end when we were all finished I was asked if we needed anything else, and I mentioned just the check. We ended up waiting about 10-15 minutes after that to receive the check, with our waiter no where to be found.\n\nI got up, and walked around looking for the waiter, with no luck. I looked through the window in the door, and had seen one of the waiters doing their nails in the back (with the same color hair and type), but I wasn't exactly sure it was her because I didn't think our waiter would be that rude.\n\nSure enough when our waiter came out about 10 minutes after that, her nails were shiny freshly done, and that's when I knew it was her. I'm not sure why she seemed to be so offended when I asked for the check, but that has never happened to me before.

Colors of turqouise blue amidst magenta and purplish color tones of the upholstered chairs, the curtains and the painted walls. Rather cheerful. But our hostess led me and my Mom to another room where it had low-lighting. Mom commented it to be a little dark for her liking. Tables were adorned with electric candlelight. A flowing fountain decorated with cherubs  was in the center next to the exit door. Tables and padded chairs were set up around the room, as well as a few green plants. Hard to tell if they were real live plants or faux. A cozy atmosphere. A painted wall lends an air of romantic mystique. \n\nWhenever dining in a Meditterranean restaurant like this which serves Persian and Mediterranean cuisine, an order of hot mint tea is my favorite beverage to go along with such cuisine.  Especially that vegetarian food is healthy and favored, for starters the \"Stuffed Grape Leaves\" was delightfully juicy. It's a great vegetarian dish, a version of Greek Dolmas. It's listed on their menu as an Appetizer. Rice and herbs were wrapped in soft grape leaves and served with tzatziki sauce that complements it well. We had the pleasure to dine on the not so obscure \"Chicken and Beef Kabobs\" which was served with rice, and vegetables. The \"Athens Fries\" were delicious in its seasoned rendering which is served with a dipping sauce. Time went by before our meal was served.  The male waitstaff was attentive, friendly and patient.\n\nAdjacent to the room we dined in had a few patrons entering and leaving the \"Hookah Lounge\" room.  It is where \"shisha\" or flavored tobacco from a common nargile (or hookah water pipe) is shared by patrons on a table. We did not enter nor try a \"hookah\". Although it is unlike nicotine smoking, it is one habit I prefer to not even desire to try. \n\nFrom the time we arrived to the time we left, there were a constant set of diners arriving and leaving the restaurant."

My companion, however, felt ill after having the eggplant parmesan.  That might not necessarily be due to the food, it was a late meal after having not eaten the whole day, so it could be from that.\n\nThe service , however, was lacking.  From the moment we walked in, 3 of the staff were standing around, chatting, ignoring us for what seemed like an eternity.  One of the ladies had a drink in her hand, complaining about it, all the while none of them acknowledged us until her diatribe was over.  Once we were seated, we waited to be served for several minutes.  Our server PEPE came over to at least acknowledge us and was gone for a few minutes before coming back for our drink order then took forever to come back for the food order.  When he finally came back he spent some time at the table across from us and practically gushed over them.  He left them and didn't come to us for another few minutes.  Then finally did and got our order.  Food took awhile to come out.  We never had out drinks refilled when he came to check on us the one time.\n\nWhen he brought our check, he seemed in a hurry to get us out.  It was the same for another table across from us - I heard the ladies comment on it.\n\nI may be back sometime when it town again, but won't be in a rush to visit this spot.  Nice to go somewhere off the strip but will explore other options next time."

I had to stop eating. It was a disappointment since I heard it was a pretty good place and I was excited. The food didn't really have any flavor beside being burnt. Maybe I'd ordered the wrong thing. Maybe I should have ordered a gyro, that might be better. I'm not going to drive so far just to try there other dishes though."

Comes with pilaf and a refreshing salad\n+Broiled Chicken Kabob: Similar to the steak kabob, but with chicken.  Chicken was not too dry (although, if you do take it to-go and reheat it, it does get dry). Came with vermicelli pilaf, which was a little salty, but the salad balances it out. \n+Combination Platter: Comes with Hummus, Tabuli, Baba Ganosh, Tatziki sauce, stuffed grape leaves, and athens fries with three dipping sauces. Served with Pita bread. This was a great plate to share, and all the sauces had a lot of flavor. Athens fries were definitely the bomb.\n\nPortions were huge, and service was quick.

I recommend the folded. They are huge! I have also had the Spinach Pie. Wasn't my favorite. I found it overly soggy and lacking in flavor.  \n\n\nI love that after your finished eating.

Perusing the reviews I saw someone else mention they call them that as well.  Now I dont feel so special.  Back then we'd go as this large group and order family style: just picking and choosing from the menu and sharing everything.  Based on those experiences I would have given it 5 stars each and every time.   From the Shrimp, Artichoke and Cheese Dip and Combination Dip plate for appetizers, to the Gyro Salad, Eggplant Parmesan, Penne Pesto Pasta and of course a side of Crack Fries all washed down with their Passion Fruit Iced Tea, it was essentially my favorite lunch spot for a number of years, and basically my introduction to Mediterranean cuisine that had previously been limited to gyro sandwiches at carnivals or mall food courts.   \n\nFast forward some years and a new job that's much further, along with a lot more experience with Mediterranean food than I had before, and a little bit of the luster has worn off.   I've been back sporadically dining in much smaller groups and as a couple and have had a mix of good and bad.  The gyro salad is still always a good choice, and I do still enjoy their pita gyros even though I've certainly had better.  I still love their Combination Dip platter, and if you like hummus you're doing a disservice to yourself in not trying the Hummus with Pesto dip here.  I've had the pita bread and crack fries range from hot and delicious to coming out cold and hardened.  I'm also not a huge fan of their falafel and rank it among some of the worst I've had here in Las Vegas.   The Passion Fruit iced tea remains delicious which is comforting.\n\nIn the end I still count on Paymon's to deliver a solid meal more often than not, though I do long for the days eating there with an impressionable mind and lots of food to try.   Now I'm getting all misty-eyed."

They do have a good selection of flavors and they do a good job of mixing them. \nService: The staff is usually prompt and friendly. They're good about checking back on you.\nCost: The price of their hookahs are pretty much in line with the industry standard. However, the happy hour deals are awesome. Having a beer/drink, as well as awesome appetizers, make the hookah experience much more enjoyable.\nLounge itself: The hookah lounge has a really relaxing darkly-lit, well-decorated environment. Seating is comfortable and can easily accommodate groups of varying size. \n\nCaf\u00e9:\nFood: I have been heard plenty of times, since long-before I discovered Yelp, and I have to say, aside from a few exceptions, I haven't really ever been impressed with their food. They do carry a decent selection focusing on cuisine from Italian, Greek, Persian, Indian and general Mediterranean. Unfortunately, as with many restaurants: over-reaching diversity usually means that quality gets sacrificed (looking at you Cheesecake Factory).  I've tried all type of food there, except Italian since I refuse to eat Italian when out, and haven't found any stand out dishes. It's not horrible, I should be clear, but it's not dynamic. \n\nI will say, however, their appetizers are usually awesome, which is what getting appetizers in the hookah lounge is so enjoyable. This goes double for Athens Fries and, admittedly, I have taken several trips to this restaurant JUST to get these fries. Also, their Arabic and Turkish coffee are pretty good. \n\nService: As with the food, I have never been impressed with their service. I wouldn't say I have encountered anybody rude but service tends to get mechanical: there's a bare minimum of personality/conversation and I haven't really seen any service instance that made me feel like we were building report versus them just providing a service. (Imagine getting served food by the Geek Squad at Best Buy). \n\nCost: They do offer some interesting deals like all-you-can-eat pasta, however, there dishes are slightly pricey for what you actually get. \n\nCafe itself: the cafe is pretty spacious and comfortable. I have yet to see a large party there personally, however, I can imagine they would easily accommodate."

The food has always been awesome - from my meat eating days when I used to order the chicken pita to my more recent vegetarian leaning days.  My current favorite thing on the menu is a big bowl of lentil soup served with a few slices of pita on the side.  Comforting and flavorful - and a perfect size for lunch - which is when I usually end up here.  If you're in the mood for something a bit more substantial, the felafel or felamus (felafel and hummus) pitas and fatosh salad are great veg choices too.  The spiced fries are good - I rarely order my own, but I've been known to poach a few off of my husband's plate every now and then.\n\nCan't comment on the hookah 'cause I don't smoke."

DEAD!\" *giggle*) according to the group of nursing student outside, who also pointed out good spots to de-stress during the midweek. For another time and yet another review. Speaking of the outside, their patio area is clean and relaxed during the fall term, but they don't have those misting things that I've seen at other places, making it murder in the summertime. Then again, the act of breathing is murder in the summertime here in our beautiful artifice where Nicolas Cage goes to die. So make it a point to please don't eat outside if you have a choice. If it's packed during lunch (which it normally is as UNLV kidz metabolize carbs like the Jamaican bobsled team on a moonshine run) come back later for dinnertime or afterhours. Trust me, it's a lot funner inside.  \n\nSeveral great things about Paymon's: A) Hookah lounge is well-maintained (nothing more disconcerting in life than \"residue\"....it's up there with some random asshole waiting in the bank line with you talking candidly about their recent colonic) and often not very full, there's subdued lighting which greatly enhances the mood and ambience. B) Athens Fries. I'm normally not too big on fries, but these properly seasoned and lightly oiled goods are, in proper culinary terms, fucking magnifique. If you're the type who carries around a boxcutter in your pocket so you can enlarge the orifice atop the ketchup bottle for Greater Pour Capability, you're missing the point. Athens Fries must be enjoyed on their own merits, that is, sans Heinz. \n\nFinally, the Chicken Skewers+Hummus+Loaded Meat Pita (+5dp Combo Bonus, +1 Comfort) are by far my favorite standbys whenever I am here. Meats are never too dry, hummus has consistent texture and does not ever have that overly acidic aftertaste that the lesser players bring to the table, and the Pita is sooooo overstuffed it'll fuel whatever adventures you have planned for a lengthy period of time after you leave. Great value for your money. There's a reason why so many other reviewers have enjoyed their time here. And....that's about it, no punchline. Lest things get too predictable. Ya heaard?"

I smoke a mixture they have called \"The Thief,\" which is one of the tastiest flavors I've ever had while smoking hookah, and I have been know to grab a smoke here and there for the last 12 years or so when smoking hookah wasn't \"the cool thing to do\" as it come to be.\n\nOn that note, Paymon's has been one of the first players in Las Vegas to have a hookah lounge. They've been around for 10 years plus I would guess.\n\nTry to go on a night where the Salvadorian guy (forgot his name) is working; he really knows how to take care of people and is great with the hookah. This place is really relaxing, the drinks are tasty, and the quality of music that creates the vibe is hard to come by anywhere else."

We usually get a combination dip with hummus and another dip (bouranni, lebni, or cucumber yogurt) and an entree to share. That's the way to go if you want enough food for two for cheap. People often say the hummus isn't that great here, and I wouldn't be surprised if it really isn't. I'm not a big hummus aficionado though, so I don't mind it. We also got the Athens fries for the first time the last time we went, and they were good...just not as good as they're hyped up to be, I suppose.\n\nWe got the Pastitsio for the entree that time, and it was very good and filling. It's sort of like lasagna, but different. We've gotten the gyro platter before, and I think that's always a good choice. Boyfriend likes the baked kibbe, but there's better things on the menu to me. We finished it off with some rice pudding that was yummy yummay.\n\nThe service is always great and fairly quick. The place is clean with a seating choice between the dining room or the courtyard. There's a mini market and a hookah lounge attached, both to which I've never been, but it just makes the place a little extra special."

I'd visited Vegas many times before we finally made it to this place, because it keeps weird hours, and always seemed to be closed when we wanted to go.  We finally caught it on a night when it was open, and it remains my first and best hookah lounge experience.\n\nWhen you enter, there's an interior \"courtyard\" dividing the Greek cafe on the right, and the hookah lounge on the left.  There are tables set up here for \"sidewalk\" dining, and this is also where they seat the overflow on the hookah lounge's waiting list.  Service isn't great out here, because the servers are usually hurrying back to the kitchen and don't check on you very much, but we did eat out here once.  I had the stuffed grape leaves, which were good but not outstanding, and the Greek fries, which lived up to all the hype.\n\nThe hookah lounge itself has great ambience: red velvety swags of fabric on the walls, sultry-eyed portraits of harem maidens everywhere, plus ornamental hookahs and pretty chandeliers.  The seating consists of low, plush couches with big cushions, perfect for lounging indolently while you smoke.\n\nWhen you sit down, they'll present you with a tray of maybe fifteen different tobacco flavors in little tins.  I've enjoyed the apple, jasmine, and vanilla - banana was interesting, but weird.  Once you choose, they'll fill up your hookah, turn it on, and after a couple of minutes, it's ready to go.  The base lights up in an ever-changing rotation of colors, which is fun to look at, and each person gets an individual disposable plastic mouthpiece for the communal hookah pipe.\n\nOne order of tobacco is good for about 30 minutes of smoke - you'll know your hookah is dead when you have to take a lung-busting inhale to get it to bubble.  If I recall correctly, it was about $15 for one sitting, so definitely take some pals to split the cost.  They're pretty good about not hassling you to leave, especially if you keep the drink orders coming, but they do have a last call (an alien concept for us Nevadans), so keep an eye on your watch.\n\nBetween the crowds of customers and the bellydancing/techno background music, it can get fairly noisy here, and it's not a place to go for quiet conversation with an intimate date.  But as an exotic stop on a boozy night out, or a post-party chill session before heading home, everybody loves the hookah lounge, the hookah hookah hookah hookah lounge..."

Our friend eventually clocked out, and we waited, and waited, and waited. Another couple came in (we were the only 4 people in our section), got their apps, and then their food. We finally got our waitress's attention, and asked, \"what about ours?\" She asked if our server knew we hadn't gotten it yet, so we let her know (again) that she was our server. She was dumbfounded and had completely forgotten about us, even though she passed us several times on her way to the table who got all of their food before us, despite coming in at least 30 minutes after us. We did get our food for free (almost an hour after coming in, so we took it to go), but this shouldn't happen in a busy restaurant, much less an almost empty one. To top it off, the gyros were nowhere near as good as the ones from the Great Greek...very little sauce, very few veggies, basically just a big pile of meat on pita bread. Will not be coming back."

For our meal we got the chicken pita and the falafel pita. They are a good size and we could not finish the whole thing. The restaurant is only a 8-10 min drive from the strip but definitely worth checking out."

Very convenient for students who don't want to lose their prime parking spot & are tired of subway and the menu at the SU.  \n\nYou can dine in their courtyard or inside.  Sitting in the courtyard doesn't actually mean your outside... It is another section of the restaurant where there is a water fountain, some trees, and lots of frames to look at on the wall.  This place has a lot of charm and it feels like you're outside without having to dread the heat (or ummm cold.) \n\nOne thing you must get when you're here is Athens Fries!  Crispy fries with their special seasoning sprinkled on top accompanied with the most addicting dipping sauce.  I could eat just that and be satisfied, its that good! \n\nThe servings here are really big.  After devouring some Athens Fries, I never have enough room to finish my entree.  Got the gyro and had enough left over for the next meal.  I ended up finishing it in the library during my study break and it still tasted just as good and it doesn't get soggy!"

I definitely think two people can share this unless you're super hungry.\n+Combination Platter: A smorgasburg of different appetizers, I think this is something fun to eat and share as a group.  Easily shareable between 3-4 people.\n\n+Service. \n\n+Price.  Definitely quality food with large portions and great service."

But most importantly our food was so good! My husband was stuffed, satisfied & couldn't even finish all his food ... @ 250 lbs, 6 ft tall with muscles - that was unusual. speaks to the really good portions which weren't overpriced & the flavor. He had a combo lamb plate and I had the eggplant parmesan. We shared hummus ... rich & tasty! We really enjoyed this place. No crazy crowds or lines - just good food & good service!"

I usually get the veggie deal, which is good. Downside is that you have to pay extra for the fries, but they're damn good fries! They have seasoned salt, which gives that extra kick.\n\nLike I said, I've gone with groups ranging from four ppl to nine. They are gracious and accommodated us. It's a bit noisy in there, but doable for groups."

They also have a good selection of food, but the fries are a MUST!  They have the best fries EVER\n\nAlso there's a house DJ in the entrance area who plays some pretty good mixes.  Love this place and will be back for sure for the fries, house music, and hookah"

            "review": "I'll start out by saying, this is perhaps one of my favorite places to eat in all of Las Vegas, and is definitely the best sit-down dining near UNLV. \n\nI have always had a wonderful experience whenever I have sat down to eat. The service is friendly, attentive, and fast. I have been both for lunch and dinner and have used their to-go services, and all of them are great. There is indoor, outdoor (with misters), and courtyard seating and all of them are very comfortable and have a wonderful ambience. \n\nThey have an excellent selection of foods ranging from salads, to Greek favorites like moussaka, spanakopita, and gyros, to all-you-can-eat pastas. There is something for almost everyone here,  BUT the true \"staple\" of this restaurant in particular are what most of my friends and I have dubbed \"CRACK\" fries (or Athen's Fries as their menu calls them). They are the most addictive food I have ever had, namely because of a delicious seasoning they smother them in. The sauce added to go with makes it a perfect storm of addictive, delicious, and bad for you.\n\nI have tried several different foods from their menu over the time I have been eating here, and I have never disliked anything on the menu. There are some meals that are obviously better than others, but I can genuinely say that I have not had a bad meal at this restaurant. But, I have fallen into a pattern now, and I get the gyro pita sandwich, wrap, with a side of fries. In the colder months, I love to get a hot tea to go with the sandwich, and they have a great variety in their selection of teas. I recommend the mango ceylon, and any of the green teas. \n\nIt is nice to have a place that has done so well for itself, has great food, great service, and is local to Las Vegas!"

I used to go to the one on Sahara about 2 years back, but this one is a lot more \"personable\" IMO. \nAnd, you guessed it! They have a awesome HAPPY HOUR (if you know me, you KNOW those are the fastest way to my heart :)! \nThe food was delish! I vote for the wings and pita pizzas...during happy hour, you can get a hookah for about 7 dollars and I'm a huge fan of \"chocolate mint\" or mixing \"strawberry and lemon\"....\n\nMost of the staff is super friendly and makes sure you have everything you want/need. We ate good, they had good music, had a good hookah and great times.... All for less than 30.00! An amazing way to wind down at the end of the day. Please, do yourself a favor and try this place at least once. You'll be glad you did. :)"
