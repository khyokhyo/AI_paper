I ordered a Kalua pork bowl with rice, beans, lettuce, cheese, etc. and a delicious charred pineapple salsa. Great portions with very flavorful ingredients. I'll def be trying them again - and hopefully they'll have coconut bark that time."

I was taken aback as she was kind and patient. I ordered the chicken tacos and a chicken burrito bowl. Both were delicious with good portions sizes. I especially loved the crunchy corn shell of the tacos as they were thick but very crunchy. I tried both the traditional brown rice and the seaweed rice. I didnt particularly love the seaweed rice. I feel like the rices in general were okay but everything else was amazing. The worker told me they have a deal on Tuesdays for tacos. Also apparently the bark for dessert is super good so I need to try that next. Will definitely be coming back again."

            "review": "Well I live in Maui so I've had a lot of Island style food.  Most of the time I find it kind of bland so I was interested to find out what this Vegas hawaiian grill would be like.  When we were waiting to order they brought us by some samplers and the Kahlua pork was nice and flavorful but I ended up with the chicken salad.  The down fall is they only had 3 kinds of dressing I believe.  Other than that the grilled chicken had a fantastic flavor.  The nicest part was that the owner was out cleaning tables and thanking customer for coming in.  That means a lot to me and I was impressed.  I would return for sure."

This is fast food burritos. \n\nBUT...Not a fan. \nGuac was good...everything else was bland.\n\nI got the bowl...seaweed rice (I think they gave me regular because it looked tasted/plain), black beans, lettuce, cabbage (they forgot), grilled green and red peppers (oily), spicy (it was not hot) salsa.......all bland.\n\nI'm VERY surprised.\n\nThe chips...first of all there were only about ten and the chips were coated in thick \"rock like\" salt. Larger than Kosher salt! I threw them away.\n\nThe mango/ corn salsa had zero mango or mango flavor in it. Odd, very odd...\n\nThe total was $19, no drinks. We went through the drive thru and it was fast prompt service. We had our own water bottles and ate outside at home because it was such a beautiful night. We threw everything away other than the small side of guac......\n\nI would have thought everything would have had flavor! I used the guac and made my own burrito. \n\nSeriously the black beans there are straight out of a can. Goo water texture and all.\n\nHubby said it was a waste time and money. He said \"never again\" lol. I will give one star because they were nice and one star for decent guac...which is really hard to mess up.........\n\n:("

            "review": "So finally got around too checking out yet another local style action in Vegas. One that has rather unique name but one that truly backs up the \"Aloha\" Spirit!! The first step walked in the whole staff shouts out \"Aloha\". Everyone is extremely helpful comes too the menu. It not your typical plate lunch action local style food. It goes in three different steps so for first timer like me (lot of confusion). The staff takes you through each one going over the options. If your expecting some mac salad, two scoops rice, or spam musubi on the menu not going too get it. =( On the other hand I enjoyed the fact really different approach  first step you can either get it in burrito wrap style, rice bowl style, or one more not remember. The protein grilled fish, kailua pork (one need too get on my next visit), and went for the huli huli chicken. I got it on bowl style with brown rice and not too much on top just black beans, and spicy tomato/maui onion salsa. You could go crazy make it full on chicken salad. I wanted too taste the chicken. I really enjoyed! IIt was nice moist, get nice portion (not just chicken but all the proteins), and had great huli huli chicken flavor you would go pick up for fundraiser action back home at some school. The black beans was ok. The salsa was winnah. It was nice little kick too it. The tomato tasted nice fresh and combine with sweet maui onion nice touch. I got some chips with side of guacamole. The guacamole was ok. The chips were solid. It nice light, crispy, and right amount of salt. Between the guacamole and the salsa. I could have had chips all night be happy braddah. Just kicking back listening too local style music some braddah \"IZ\". \n\nThe owner if awesome. The guy goes around asking if you like everything and next thing know talking stories about the islands. I love the interior can tell they put nice brighter color too it then the prior owner some Greek place never been. All the art work had Hawaii little on the touristy prints but others had more local style vibe. The music. Now if enjoy listening too local Hawaiian music PLUS action cause all they played during my lunch. They even have drive-thru also. \n\nReally could almost say Braddah's Island Style is healthy option minus the mac salad. You can have the option of brown rice, pick your sides all healthier side (seen you can even go protein and rice), and not going too break your bank either. Love the atmosphere and for sure plan on coming back for some kalua pig!! Till next time.."

Made it special. I did get a guacamole, and while it was really tasty, they added huge chunks of onions to it. That's a big no-no and why they lost a star for me. If guac is going to have to onions, they need to be small with added tomatoes and cilantro. But the bites of guac without the nasty onion slices tasted fresh!"

Choose your meat, add the 'filler' like rice, beans, cabbage, etc....\n\nNext add the salas, finally add all the other condiments like guacamole and sour cream. Oh yah, you can top it off with a saald dressing too!\n\nI got a salad, huli huli chicken, (small bite size grilled slightly crispy outside chicken) with bed of romaine lettuce, add the spicy tomato with grilled Maui onion,  ( don't worry, it's not spicy at all, buy savory), I added sour cream, guacamole with hawaiian pink salt, and the roasted sesame gingerette (tasted the sesame but ginger not so much).\n\nIt was really good,  enjoyed it and will difinitly be back to try more! Friendly staff, excellent service and good flavors!"

Their version is as good as any I've tried and better than some.  I'd planned on having that...until I tasted the steak cubes. WOW!  One of the most flavorful meats I've ever eaten.  Portion was huge.  Counter service was fast and friendly.  Tables were clean.  What more can a hungry diner want?

Price is kinda high for what you order cause no sides are included, and is purchased at an additional cost. The guacamole for the chips was refreshing and fresh. Expect to spend about $12 for entree, side, and drink. Check on Yelp for deals to save at Braddah's."

Didn't bid then, but regretted having missed that option so jumped on a chance to buy a Groupon when the opportunity arose. Finally visited the restaurant on Thursday night. Went with a group of 4. Each of us chose a different option--salad, rice bowl, burrito, tacos--and each was thrilled with his/her choice. In addition to the delicious food, we were impressed by the friendly, helpful staff. They offered us samples of the meats and accepted our Groupon without any issue. We will be returning again--and again."

Check!\n\nWe walked in and were immediately greeted by the super nice guy behind the counter. He asked if we were first timers. \"Yes we are!\" He then offered us a sample of the huli huli chicken and the pulled pork. Both were delicious! Think of Chipotle where you can get a burrito, bowl, tacos, or a salad with your choice of meat. I opted for the bowl with the chicken. He then proceeded to ask what I wanted my bowl to consist of. SO MANY OPTIONS. My bowl had the seaweed rice (so good), chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, pineapple salsa, sour cream and jalapenos. Portions are huge so it's a good thing I came hungry. I docked them a star because when he scooped the tomatoes into my bowl, he didn't strain them first. So by the time I was at the bottom of the bowl, there was a puddle of tomato water. Not so appealing when your food is drenched in it. At that point I couldn't eat any more of it. Otherwise, the bowl was pretty tasty. Chicken was bursting with flavor, the seaweed in the rice was an extra treat and the pineapple salsa was outstanding. \n\nI really wanted to try the coconut bark, but I knew it wasn't a good idea after stuffing my face. I'll try it next time for sure, which gives me an excuse to come back!"

The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the clean modern decor. I was very impressed. Very spacious dining room and outside seating. The menu consisted of tacos, burritos, bowls etc. Your typical Chipotle menu, but what made it stand out was the meat selections were all Hawaiian local style preparations such as pulehu steak, kalua pig, huli huli chicken and grilled fish. The girl behind the counter generously offered a sample of the kalua pig which I found to be delicious, tender and juicy. We ordered 3 huli huli chicken burritos, a kalua pig bowl and a kalua pig burrito along with a kids menu cheese quesadilla. The kids meal comes with tortilla chips and a drink. Although we were thoroughly impressed by the food and the service, what really pleased me is that they pay attention to the small details like the cutlery, napkins, and to-go bags. All of these were pretty \"high end\" when it comes to disposables. The napkin was nice and thick, the kind you would get at an actual nice sit down restaurant. The cutlery was sturdy and the to go bag was not some cheap plastic bag, it was a nice, large, sturdy shopping bag with handles. \nI know this place is new, and I really hope they make it. I know I will definitely spread the word and keep coming back especially during my lunch breaks at work because they ingeniously also have a DRIVE THRU! Yay!!!"

That's when I found Braddah's and was even more pleased that they have a drive through window! \n\nThe simplicity of the menu definitely made it easy to order quickly, which is a nice change from most drive-through eateries.\n\nSTEP 1: Burrito (flour or wheat tortilla), Rice Bowl, Salad, or Tacos (3)\nSTEP 2: Huli Huli Chicken ($6.95), Kalua Pig ($6.95), Pulehu Steak ($7.60), Grilled Fish ($7.50), or Grilled Veggies ($6.25)\nSTEP 3: Seaweed Rice, Black Beans, Grilled Veggies (additional $1.25), and/or Guacamole made with Hawaiian pink salt (additional $1.65)\nSTEP 4: Charred Pineapple Verde (Mild), Mango & Roasted Corn (Medium), or Tomato with Grilled Maui Onions (Spicy); Salad Dressing - Papaya Buttermilk Ranch or Roasted Sesame Gingerette\nSTEP 5: Sour cream, cheese, lettuce, jalapeno, cabbage, lime, cliantro, and/or bean sprouts.\n\nSince I was traveling, I opted for a Kalua Pig Burrito with rice (I'm not sure why they call it \"seaweed\" rice, but it's plain ol' sticky white rice), beans, medium salsa, lettuce, cabbage, lime, and cilantro. It's a really good sized burrito and it was very good of them to cut it nicely in half without having to ask. I really enjoyed the flavor from the Kalua Pig and it was done nicely - tender, juicy. Everything else accompanying it was fresh and added crunchy textures with additional flavors.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chipotle, Cafe Rio, or similar \"Mexican\" build-your-own tacos/burritos restaurants, however, I really appreciate the Hawaiian-style meats and fillings. I'm sure the rice bowls are good as well and I'll need to try their other meats. I've heard a lot of raving about the coconut bark, so I will try that next time!"

I had the hardest time deciding between the steak, chicken, and pork and I just decided on getting the chicken and steak, but the pork will have its turn in the future!\n\nThe ordering style is identical to Chipotle. If you haven't been to a Chipotle, what you essentially do is tell the first person what kind of dish you want along with your meat. You'll go along the line and say what items you want and don't want on your dish. At the end of the line, you and the people making your dish have made your masterpiece! Just a reminder, just like Chipotle, if you get a burrito bowl, you can get tortillas on the side, which is a definite plus in my book. It seems like you can't pile it up as high as Chipotle, but the food is still nonetheless delicious. Take a visit if you're craving delicious food!"

I told her it was my first time and she gave me samples of every meat they offer. I went with the steak bowl. It was so good. It is such a big serving that I brang half home to eat for later. They had a seaweed rice which is Amazing and different. I put red cabbage on mine as well. They also have a amazing mango salsa to add to it. There is a lot more selection here than Chipotle in my opinion. I agree the steak is on thr sweeter side so you do have to love the sweet if you want the steak. Just ask for a sample. Makes me not ever want to step foot in Chipotle again. Where has this been all my life? LOL I will be back for sure. The Groupon was a great deal so always check before coming in."

When she found our it was my first time, she immediately offered me a sample of pork and chicken (I also tried the fish). I ended up getting a fish burrito. It's delicious. They give you the option of white or wheat tortilla (why hasn't chipotle figured that out?) which is great. I ended up getting as spicy a burrito as I could. My only issue is that the only hot sauces available are mild and medium. I of course wanted something hotter, but all in all it was a good experience. I wish I'd seen the Yelp deal, but there's usually a Groupon so no worries."

Then your selection of meat, toppings & sauce. The great thing is they let you try the meat before you make a decision. I went with the steak and the pork.  For my first time trying Hawaiian style bbq meat.Boy was it tasty and flavorful!  Since I decided I would make a bowl. I chose seaweed brown rice, corn salsa which I think was med or mild spice. Can't remember  but it was phenomenal.  Your reg toppings  of lettuce,lime,shredded cheese.  They have different  types of sauces they make in house. I went with the pineapple mango habanero.  Sweet with a nice kick from the habanero  sauce. \n\nAs it was my first time ever going here the cashier (I wish I remembered her name. I know she told me she moved from cali.) She was so friendly and we'll mannered. Anyhow she gave us a sample of the coconut bark.  Make sure you buy some of this! It's like a short bread cookie with one side covered in dark chocolate,the other in caramel nd shredded coconut sprinkled on top.I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate  but the combo of the caramel and coconut. Omg! Amazing. Needless to say I brought  1/4 lb after devouring my sample to bring back home to ny.\n\n This is the original location and we met the owner who is looking  to expand! He was nothing short of great! Very enthusiastic and polite at the same time. I hope someday you open a restaurant  in ny! I'll be sure to be first in line. When I return to vegas this will always be one of my go to food spots!"

I had ordered a grilled fish burrito, no beans, brown rice, level 3 sauce, cilantro, and lettuce. I don't understand how I ended up with no fish, black beans, and the rest of the fillings in a burrito. Did I really just pay for a fish burrito without the fish and replaced with black beans that I hate? One of my friends got his order correct. My other friend got a steak burrito without any sauce. If I could rate the food alone, then I would give it a 1 star. Only reason is because I REALLY HATE BEANS. The service was very nice. The offered a little sample of their coconut bark as a thank you for being patient while they prepared the order. I am sure they would have corrected the mistake except for the fact that I went through drive thru and didn't discover the mistake until I got home. I don't live very close so it would have been a tedious trip just to get the correct order. It could have been a bad time to order 3 items through drive thru so, again, I don't mind giving them another try. Let's just hope that if I do go back, then they will give me the order I requested. Crossing my fingers but not holding my breath"

Very cheesy but also really greasy. \n- I recommend the Mango and roasted corn salsa! Excellent!\n- Great creativity.

            "review": "Reading all these reviews, I couldn't help but think \"what's a Hawaiian Chipotle?\".  Well, I finally got to find out for myself.  Yes, when you walk in it's almost like Chipotle.  Your meals are made in an assembly line fashion, it's fast food, and the prices are similar.  \n\nThe process is simple...select your meats (Kalua Pork, Steak, Huli Huli Chicken, Veggies, Fish, or Shrimp).  Then choose whether you want your meats in a bowl with rice, in a salad, a burrito, and even a taco.  Then after this, you select all the extras like sour creams, beans, guac, etc.  For me, my decision was easy.  I wasn't feeling a burrito or taco.  I also wasn't doing a salad or rice bowl. So, I chose just a side of steak and a side of chicken.  I thought both meats were a bit greasy and lacking some flavor.  I know Chipotle isn't any better when it comes to grease, but at least there's a little taste there.  I still managed to down my dish because I don't believe in quitting.  My gf got steak with rice and beans. She also had to get their coconut bark.  Might as well, especially since they're known for it.  I had a piece and thought that it was pretty good.  It's pretty much a toffee tasting, Almond Roca tasting, sweet piece of candy.  That one piece was probably the highlight.  \n\nMy gf had a $20 Groupon for our meals and we were originally sticker shocked that just two bowls, 2 drinks, and coconut bark was over $22.  Something just didn't add up.  When I got home, I realized why.  Instead of Braddah's charging me for a side of chicken and a side of steak, they charged me for a full bowl.  Yeah, we were over-charged about $2.  I'm not going broke because of this, but it's the principle.  \n\nOverall, with a recent 5 Star ROTD for Braddah's and some of the hype I'm seeing, I have to say that I was a little disappointed.  The thought of Hawaiian food mixed with tacos and burritos sounded great.  But when it came down to it...they are just A-OK\n\nPS:  At least the restaurant is clean and there's a drive thru.\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (493/500)"

When I walked up to the entrance around noon on a weekday, I noticed that the line went almost out the door; this is usually a good sign.  There were about 7 or 8 people in line.  Because everything is kind of labor intensive to make, it took about 20 minutes to get to the front of the line; not good for business people on a lunch break.  \n\nI decided on the Huli Huli Chicken Salad with various fixings.  The setup reminded me very much of Chiptole, but with a Hawaiian vibe.  Also, decided to pick up a small box of their coconut bark which was very tasty.\n\nThe seating area was pleasant and clean with a few others eating their meals.  My chicken salad bowl looked delicious, but I was very disappointed that the chicken was somewhat dry and had very minimal seasoning. Boo!  Even with the other toppings this, didn't even rise to the level of a tasty salad.  I had to resort to adding salt and pepper to my salad, which is very rare for me.  \n\nBut before I started to eat my salad, I realized that I'd forgotten to pick up my small box of coconut box from the cashier.  So, I went up to the counter and patiently waited for the worker to recognize me and ask what I needed; I would assume that's normal protocol.  I realize she was busy, but instead of asking what I wanted, I was totally ignored.  After three other customers paid, I finally spoke up and asked for my small box of bark.  Braddah's, your workers need to pay more attention to the customers."

Most of the meats were at the bottom of the container it was in and needed a refill. Were they waiting to serve the very last bit before grilling more meat? Lucky me got the last of the meat. I tried the chicken and it had barely any taste. I never order pulled pork in restaurants but since the chicken was flavorless and the steak was slathered in sauce I went for the pork. They charge extra for avocado which is the same as Chipotle but it is free at Zaba's with a salad. Avocado just does not taste good with these mix of flavors at Braddah's. The woman who got my bowl shaked it off before putting food inside (guess it was wet from dishwashing?) nevertheless thanks for the bowl filled with drops of water. I find the food bland and weird mix of flavors. I honestly liked nothing about this place, especially the food which was not fresh. I think that when meat looks dried out and old it is time to replace it with a new batch, especially during the day on a weekend. I would understand a little more if it were right before closing."

            "review": "My husband and I stopped by Braddah's this past Friday for lunch around 12:30 pm. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted and acknowledged by the 3 employees behind the counter. They asked us if this was our first time here and if we would like to try a sample of their food. So two of the employees started to scoop up each of the meat options (fish, beef, pork, chicken) in a small cardboard container for each of us to try. After that, we decided to order:\n\nHuli Huli Chicken Salad Bowl with Brown Rice and roasted corn ($6.95 prior to tax): I wanted to get a salad but because I am Asian, I wanted to have some brown rice (odd combination, but I really did like the rice in this salad bowl). I did not have any dressing with this salad and thought the flavor of the chicken and roasted corn was enough to flavor up my bowl. The chicken was tender. The portion of this bowl was more than enough for myself for lunch. \n\nKalua Pork Burrito on Whole Wheat Tortilla ($6.95 prior to tax): This burrito is a pretty large size (perfect for 2 meals). You have your choice of ordering this on a flour tortilla as well and additional toppings you desire (it does cost extra for avocado). My husband ordered this with the seaweed rice, corn, Maui onions, diced tomatoes and some lettuce. The burrito was an excellent combination of flavors that was perfect for our lunch. \n\nCoconut Bark (1/4 pound free with Yelp check in): I was pretty happy to see that I could get a 1/4 pound of coconut bark for free with the check in on my app. My husband and I both had a piece of it after we finished our meals. I loved the caramel, chocolate and coconut pieces in each delicious bite and wanted more. I loved the coconut bark so much that I decided to purchase 1/2 pound to take back home. Too bad Braddah's isn't closer to me because I could see myself coming more often just for this dessert to bring for parties (or just to eat by myself). \n\nI wished there was a trash can in the seating area so that I can throw out my own used cardboard dishes and put away my own tray because I saw some tables that still needed to be attended to, although customers may have left a while ago. \n\nBraddah's has some in house spicy sauces and my husband loved the mango, pineapple habanero sauce the best. Unfortunately one small bottle cost $6.95 (prior to tax) that my husband was not willing to purchase to take back home. Since I am not into spicy foods, I didn't try any so I can't comment on the taste. But my husband did mention that he liked the sweet spiciness. \n\nI am definitely a big fan of this restaurant and wouldn't mind coming back here again the next time I am in Vegas. The food was wonderful and and service was nice. I liked the Hawaiian music playing while we ate our lunch. This place reminded me of eating in someone's home because it was very welcoming (truly the aloha Hawaiian spirit). \n\nJust want to mention that there is free wifi here (password protected, long password is posted on the wall in the restaurant) that was pretty fast. The women's restroom was clean. There is also plenty of parking (this place is located in a plaza with other businesses) right outside of this restaurant."

Your choice of meat and side ingredients/toppings served to you in a bowl, as a taco, wrapped burrito style, or as a salad.  If you're not into chicken, pork, steak or fish, you can also get grilled veggies in lieu of the meat.\n\nAfter several visits, it's clear the meat is always cooked well and tender and they always offered samples.  The toppings are fresh and tasty, and there are also additional sauces in the dining room if you want to add some additional flavors or heat.  The staff is courteous and the portions are large.\n\nIf you're in a hurry and don't want the usual fast food options, Bruddah's is a cool addition to the valley's Hawaiian food choices."

This is one of the first times that Yelp has led me astray, and it makes me sad.\n\nFirst, let me say that the staff here are incredibly friendly and helpful.  They go out of their way to make your experience good.  Upon walking in, we were asked if it was our first time, and then were promptly given samples of all the meats.  I immediately noticed how low quality and fatty the meat was.  The chicken and steak, though flavored nicely, were incredibly gristly and fatty.  The kalua pork is cooked well, but a bit on the salty side for me.  I got a steak burrito with the mild salsa, which just ended up being way too sweet because of the sweetness of the steak and the fact that the mild salsa is basically limes and pineapple (my fault, I guess for ordering it).  My wife ordered a chicken bowl, which was decent but not great.  We also got a side of chips and salsa, which I regret immensely.  The chips were stale and tasted like they came from a bag.  The salsa again was too sweet.  Our total bill came to $20 without drinks (a bit pricey, IMO).\n\nThe dining experience in general was basically a Hawaiian themed Chipotle. In case you're wondering, overly sweetened Hawaiian topped with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and sugary salsa is NOT a good combination.  The food just really isn't that good.  Not only have I had much better food in general based on recommendations from Yelp, I've had much better Hawaiian food in Las Vegas.  I honestly don't know how people are rating this anything above 3 stars."

(The dining certificates are always a great way to try out a new place.) Loved it! As first time customers we were given a sample of the meats; which should have made our choice easier, it didn't. After dithering back and forth, my friend settled on the huli huli chicken burrito with the works and the spicy and medium salsas and myself on three soft tacos (two fish and one kalua pig). I had the rice, cabbage, guacamole, one of each salsa, and cheese. Loved the flavor mix. Liked the three different salsas; heat from the tomato with maui onion had just the right kick, the mango corn and grilled pepper was light and refreshing, and the charred pineapple verde went really well with my fish. Actually, everything went well with everything. The meats and fish were very flavorful (as attested to by the others), moist, and tender. Staff was friendly and helpful, oh yeah, don't forget patient. Definitely a return trip is in order."

I'm by no means Hawaiian or do I know much about the culture, but I don't believe I have to just to give a great review. All their food is fresh and it's simple. Sometimes trying out new place I can get a little overwhelmed by all the different options, but they keep it simple. If I were to compare it to some other restaurant I would honestly say its incomparable. You can choose between making a burrito bowl, a regular bowl with seaweed rice or brown rice, a salad, 3 tacos or their nachos. For me I ALWAYS go for the three tacos, I usually get each one different (Huli Huli Chicken, Kahlua Pig, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Fish, or Grilled Veggies).  From there you pick what you want on top of it. The other toppings are great, but in no way, shape or form compare to their homemade sauces! They have Charred Pineapple Verde (mild), Mango & Roasted Corn (medium) and Tomato w/ grilled Maui Onions (hot). Bottom line, if you go to Bruddah's and don't try their sauces and most of all their coconut Bark, you're missing out! Also on top of being amazing, their coconut bark switches up during specific holidays (Thanksgiving- they have pumpkin bark). I could go on forever, but you might as well check it out for yourself."

Portions are large and flavors are ok, wraps were hard and cold, meats were dripping with grease. \n\nPart of the appeal of Hawaiian/local food restaurants like island sushi and island flavor for me is the atmosphere - it feels like home because of the food, music and people. This place was empty, silent, and the girl working the counter seriously didn't give a sh*t. It had a fast food mcdonalds type of vibe and I wasn't feeling that either. I would maybe go back to try the coconut bark, but otherwise - pass. \n\nWith that said, I could easily see this becoming a small national chain. Calling steak pulehu (means grilled) sounds exotic I guess. People seem to like being adventurous without really being adventurous if that makes sense."

As I perused the step by step ordering process, my Chipotle senses started tingling. I took the burrito route-- my soft spot. Half steak, half Kailua pig, seaweed rice, all 3 salsa's (I know it says choose 1), black beans, lettuce, cheese, cilantro, sour cream, tortilla chips, lime (yes I would love it freshly squeezed into my burrito). And then it was time for the woman to roll my burrito-- how is she going to do it? I don't know, and it still puzzles me to this day. Needless to say, perfectly rolled burro. The concoction was as good as it sounds-- and yes you can use my building strategy, I haven't patented it yet. Did I mention the employees were the nicest people ever? Will be returning here every time I come to Vegas."

It was immediately apparent the owner was passionate about his craft when he proudly had us sample his hand crafted recipes for Pork, Beef, and Chicken. They were absolutely amazing. Moist, fresh, and perfectly cooked. The owner talked about his passion for fresh food, and his desire to bring something unique and healthy to Las Vegas, and he delivers. You might think this is another Chipotle, or Zabas but ah you would be wrong. Something about an artisan hand crafting the food he is passionate about that can not be matched by a big chain and employees who have no stake in the business' success. This has the potential to be the next big thing. Unique recipes, huge portion, and humble prices. This is definitely one not to miss, and is sure to be a Vegas favorite. The owner said they are going to be opening a second location at Durango and Centennial very soon! Thanks for an excellent dining experience, you have a few new regulars!"

Lets start with the positives.  Upon entering I was offered a nice Hawaiian style welcoming into the restaurant.  Mahalo to them for that.  I was asked if it was my first visit and I said yes.  With that I was offered a sample of the kalua pig and huli huli chicken.  Both were very good though I don't always care for pork.  This was on the oily side but still had a great initial flavor.  It is the porky after taste I don't care for.  The chicken on the other hand was a stand out with a sort of sweet and salty taste with a hint of grill char.  So I selected the huli huli chicken to fill my burrito.  When I ordered a burrito I was disappointed to see a generic Mission brand flour tortilla pulled out of the bag.  I mean seriously $7 for a burrito in an 8 inch tortilla?  It turns out they ran out of their usual jumbo tortillas.  So alright, I'll let this one slide.  Next came a very carefully measured spoon of seaweed rice (awesome flavor BTW) and an equally measured spoon of chicken.  It was a new guy making my order and he was being very cautious to the point of me feeling like I was getting ripped off.  But with the addition of the black beans, two kinds of salsa (roasted pine apple and corn varieties) and some shredded cheese I realized just how much was packed into this little tortilla.  There was so much in fact that it could not be fully rolled.  One of the burrito veterans came over for the assist and rolled an extra tortilla around the first and got a nice tightly tucked buritto.  When I reached the register I ordered a can of Hawaiian green tea and was asked if I wanted coconut bark.  I declined the bark as I don't even know what it is.  Not that it matters.  I am not a coconut fan any how.  So I paid and found a table in the corner and took my first bite of an Island Style burrito and honeslty I was not blown away.  Beneath the rice, beans and salsa the flavor of the chicken was lost.  I'm not saying it was a bad burrito but all together it lacked something.  The salsa could have been hotter.  I realize that I got the mild and medium salsas but there just wasn't much to them.  Mostly what I could taste in the burrito was the seaweed rice.  I do love the taste of seaweed so that was nice but overall it was nothing special.  My other issue is the limited menu.  They specialize in burritos, tacos, salads and bowls.  They also seem to have chips and guacamole.  What I really wish they had is musubi but I guess that doesn't quite fit their business model.  I think I will give them another try some time.  Perhaps I'll try another protien other than chicken.  It is my understanding they have steak and fish too though neither were offered as a sample.  I would like to give the steak a try though.  Perhaps I will appreciate the steak more than the chicken and bump up Braddah's to the four stars I know I want to give them."

She gave us samples of the meats that were offered. The huli-huli chicken and pulehu steak were okay, it didn't really pack a punch in my opinion, but the kalua pork was flavorful and on point. Most of their sauces were too sweet for my taste. I liked the coconut colada pearl the best, even though it was the spiciest I found that by adding just a splash it enhanced the meat with just enough heat to it. \n\nSo for 3 bowls and a box of holiday bark we ended up paying a little over $36 which I thought was kinda steep. We got in the car, drove off and I just happen to check the receipt and realized they had charged us for the 2 boxes of coconut bark that was supposed to be free with the yelp check in. We went back, they apologized and all was well. While waiting for the hubby to get back I took a bite of the coconut bark, it was pretty tasty but nothing I would kill for.

We used to order the bowls but the container has gotten so small that we now order the burritos. They have even been holding back on how much salsas they put on the burritos! And $2.35 for the canned Hawaiian fruit drinks is downright ridiculous! I'm rating Braddah's four stars on the food but giving them three stars on the service and food portions. Step back up, Braddah's! You used to be so awesome before you started branching out and opening new locations!"

I'm not going to lie, I was not a fan of the food at first. The main one being that the actual temperature of the food wasn't piping hot like I enjoy. I think all of the veggies and cold salsas took away from the warmth of the meat. I had the HuliHuli chicken burrito with seaweed rice, fajita veggies, corn salsa, and guac. The chicken was seasoned well but it was a bit on the cold side for a burrito. In your defense we did come in about 15 minutes before closing and maybe I got the last batch of chicken.\nAfter much debate my boyfriend drug me back into this location (He's a HUGE fan of Braddahs) to give it one more try. I was honest with the young lady working and she asked lots of questions about what I did not like on my first visit and was determined to fix it..... she talked me into something different.\nThis time around I had a three taco plate. 1 Kahluah Pig and 2 steak tacos and  OH MYYYYYY....... AMAZING!!!\nThat Kahluah pig was perfectly seasoned, juicy, and tender, as was the steak. The tacos were very generously portioned out. Perfect!!!\nThank you for making a believer out of me!\nP.S.

As a Hawaiian who's super passionate about food, it's didn't take long to hear about this place. My impression was that this was a Hawaiian joint taking a Mexican fusion approach. I wanted to visit this place to see how accurate that was. \n\nRolling up to Braddah's, I thought it was super cute! Yellow awning type roof, outside seating with bright yellow umbrellas. I knew the inside wouldn't disappoint as well. The color scheme is green and yellow, a very common combo from my hometown on the Big Island. My past schools had the same color scheme and a lot of housing tend to represent the same combo. The walls were beautifully adorned with Hawaii prints, maps and other artwork. Hawaiian music played over the speakers bringing a laid back vibe to the restaurant. The staff was pretty young, but full of the Aloha spirit. Kenny, a long time employee is someone I met through the Hawaiian community here in Vegas and seems to really embody the Hawaiian mentality. It made me feel like I was visiting a place back home in Hawaii! \n\nThe food choice was really creative! I felt like I was visiting the Hawaiian version of Chipotle or Cafe Rio! For step 1, you basically choose a burrito, bowl, salad or 3 tacos and take it from there. On this visit, I chose the bowl, topped with step 2, kalua pig for $6.95 and doubled with huli huli chicken for an extra $2.00. Step 3, I chose seaweed rice (brown rice with nori) and black beans, step 4 I went with the mango and corn salsa, as well as the guacamole for an extra $1.65. My last step, step 5, I chose toppings like cabbage, cilantro and a'a lava chips. As you can see, you're literally building a plate from the ground up. Lots to choose from and the food was awesome. The kalua pig was super smokey and really juicy! The chicken was flavored well and really tender. All toppings and elements brought that Latin flare and a refreshing component. The cabbage and chips helped to represent a crunchy texture. Truly a great dish! For dessert I had to get the small coconut bark for $3.95. It was 1/4 of a pound goodness! Chocolate, caramel, cookie and coconut layered to make a sweet delight. Great way to end this wonderful meal! \n\nSeeing the great deals they offer on Groupon AND Yelp, makes me wonder. Usually Groupon deals to me, means the place is trying to attract more customers. The food they offer, in my opinion, does not need all that hype. When you serve great food at affordable prices, people will just come. This place serves pretty amazing food if I say so myself :-) I live on the opposite side of the valley and after trying this place out, I'm definitely coming back again soon, no matter the distance. It was delicious! So excited they're going to be opening up a Maryland location!!!"

The meat was juicy and really flavorful. It reminds me of beef which is probably why I didn't mind it. The bowl came with rice, lettuce, salsa, and some other stuff. They even gave me a free sample of their dessert, which was not really good. It was a weird blend of chocolate and coconut (don't get me wrong, I  like both of those things!). I would come back again if I was in the area and craving something like Chipotle. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back though.. \n\nOverall, this place is worth trying if you want some \"healthy\" comfort food. The staff members are really nice and patient.. Be sure to ask them any questions and they are more than willing to provide you with some samples to help figure out what you want to eat."

Upon entering we were welcomed by a very friendly staff who asked if we had ever been there before and when we said we had not, they offered us a sampling of some of their meat options - kalua pig and huli huli chicken. After reviewing the menu, you will immediately be able to tell that this place reminds you of other burrito, bowl, and taco places where you can build your own meal, but this definitely comes with the aloha flavor. \n\nStep 1 - Choose your setting - burrito, 3 tacos, bowl, or salad\nStep 2 - Choose your meat - huli huli chicken, kalua pig, pulehu steak, grilled fish or grilled veggies\nStep 3 - Add rice, black beans, grilled veggies (extra charge), guacamole (extra charge)\nStep 4 - Choose your salsa - charred pineapple verde (mild), mango & roasted corn (medium), tomato with grilled maui onions (spicy)\nStep 5 - Add more toppings (included) - sour cream, cheese, lettuce, jalapenos, cabbage, lime, cilantro, bean sprouts\n\nOverall, I was very satisfied with what I got. The meats are flavorful and the portions are good for what you are paying for. They also have a number of other island flavor sauces that you can add as well - their version of hot sauces. Looking forward to the next time I can go back to try some of their other options and I've heard their dessert is very good too."

Service was great and they also handed out samples of their most popular proteins, Kalua Pig and Huli Huli Chicken which were very good.\n\nI went with a Burrito, half Huli-Huli Chicken, Half Pulehu Steak, Seaweed Rice, black beans, lettuce and sour cream, tomato-onion salsa on the steak, and Pineapple Verde on the chicken side. I took a bite, then another one, and another one, half way through, the tortilla starts cracking(not heated long enough to stay pliable). the salsas were okay, but I was also looking for the sweetness of the pineapple which was lost. As I said earlier, the proteins were good, but I think I'll skip the tortilla, beans, and lettuce, and get a bowl instead. Poi and Squid Luau would be awesome sides, too! Just wishful thinking.....\n\nThe Coconut Bark was good though-layers of brittle, sweet dough, and chocolate with a sprinkling of coconut were ADDICTING! I'll give it another go when they set up shop in the former Slidin' thru location. Hopefully it'll be better the next time around.  ALOHA!!!"

It didn't have the typical \"rough around the edges\" family owned business type of feel so I was already impressed. Right upon walking in they offer to give me samples of the different meats, I was initially going to have the pork since it's their signature but after tasting the samples I opted for the chicken instead because I liked the flavor more. Just from that gesture the service was already off to a good start. The chicken was Teriyaki but not so strong of a flavor which is good so you can taste the other elements in your burrito or bowl. I must say since I frequently eat at Chipotle I am accustomed to their portion sizes and Braddah's is slightly smaller, almost to the point I would need to order a side. I was given a free sample of dessert which is what they call \"coconut bark\" and I absolutely loved it. It was like a gram cracker (not really sure) covered with chocolate and coconut flakes. I would actually come here just to have this. While eating I noticed the owner was doing some accounting paperwork at another table, usually owners of new businesses greet diners while eating and I guess he was too consumed into what he was doing? Overall good place, just kinda far from where I live."

Not only is the food fantabulous & the staff welcoming, but the owner came out to greet us & he was also just as fantastic as his place! I really hope everyone continues to patronize this location since he mentioned it's been slow... PLEASE DON'T LET THIS LOCATION DIE!!! Everyone come out & support this great concept!!!"

            "review": "Braddah's Island Style is often referred to as the \"Hawaiian Chipotle\". While agree that the process and ordering is the same, the food here is not comparable to Chipotle, because it is very different. The meats are different because they are marinated in different sauces - in fact, when I order steak and chicken at Chipotle, there's no marination going on. Also, toppings are different, especially their choice of salsas, which are very different from your typical mild, medium, and hot at Chipotle.\n\nI could go on comparing the two, but I should really get on with what is GOOD about Braddah's, and what makes them STAND OUT as a fast food chain, and not necessarily another \"Chipotle\" (also remember there is Zaba's and Qdoba...). \n\nI've had the Huli Huli Chicken and the Pulehu Steak - I prefer the Chicken. The steak, while good, was too much on the sweet side for me. I've had bowls, tacos, and burritos from Braddah's. All of them are very good.\n\nSalsas are the main stars, in my opinion. Giving you options to choose from mild to hot - each of the salsas are good in their own way - charred pineapple verde gives some sweetness because of the pineapple, mango and roasted corn give a hearty flavor with extra oomph from the corn kernels, and tomato with grilled Maui onions is my favorite because it gives you the HEAT.\n\nNot to be left out is the coconut bark - a delicious sweet/salty/crunchy/smooth dessert. It's one of those creations that is on-par with Cheetohs, because Cheetohs are so wonderful - crunchy, cheesy, pleasing - same goes for coconut bark, it gives you so many feels, smells, and tastes you're left wondering how you could have been living without having had it.\n\nService on the night I went to this particular location was SLOW. I felt as though service could have been picked up a bit, but other than that I have no complaints. The food is totally worth the price points. When I crave Chipotle I will go to Chipotle, but if I want something different - I will come here."

I went in with my good friend and we were excited to try a place as similar to Chipotle as we could find. Upon entering we were greeted with the extremely friendly Hawaiian vibe that people travel to Hawaii for. \n\nAs we were reading the menu and continued to ask questions about what to get and what the options were, she offered us samples of EVERYTHING. The fish was my favorite, which I have gotten time and time again. She told us the different flavored salsa's that they had, mango pic de gayo and such. I don't remember the names, but the green is a delightfully sweet and sour blend added to your dish. \n\nI got the bowl, which is twice what they give at chipotle, my friend got the burrito and was not disappointed. Burrito stuffed and bowl overflowing, a food lover hearts dream. The flavors that exploded when we took our first bites made us instant fan-girls of Braddah's. We have been back twice a month since April! And will continue to come back this frequently. \n\nNow to the whole reason we spend so much money at this place. The coconut bark. My life completed it's journey when I took the first bite. Perfect blend of a saltine cracker topped with caramel, chocolate and coconut shavings sprinkled on top. I always get extra's for lunch and desserts for the next few days. \n\nGo try this little pocket of Hawaii in Vegas."

Needless to say I was not impressed especially for all of the 5 star reviews. We came half an hour to closing but this is quick stop and go food so I figured I was fine. I got the steak burrito with seaweed rice, black beans, pineapple salsa, and the regular fixings. The food looked cold but I thought I saw some steam come from somewhere so I'd be alright. I got home and took it out of the bag, thought I felt some remote warmth...took a bite so much for that it was cold. I was too hungry to care, about 1/3 into the burrito I felt sick. The damn steak tasted like friggin rock candy. Shit was about to have me bouncin' off the walls! I also got a bag of their chips to accompany my burrito, I could've bought the same ones at the grocery store. I am close to certain I will not try again unless I have some life altering Notebook moment."

I knew they were doing well based on awesome reviews here but I never had the desire to try it again. \n\nWell, that was a fail on my part because I missed out. Yesterday, I decided to finally come back and ordered the same bowl I got two years ago. This time, they were generous on their meat, the steak is much more flavorful, toppings were on point and the bowl remained warm and not cold from the various toppings. I also had the chance to try the Coconut Bark & although I am not a huge fan of coconut, I thought it was delish, chewy and not too sweet. \n\nI had a cold yesterday and was studying for my final so thanks to Braddah's for a yummy dinner cause it made me feel much better! Glad I tried you again and I will definitely be back. :)"

Dudes spinning their fire pole thingy. Ha ha, that's a nice visual. Anyways, all you did was walk into a Braddah's Island Style restaurant. Ok, you can stop the music now. Actually when you go there they really do play Hawaiian music. \n\nWhen you come here, your options are simple with 5 easy steps. \n\nSTEP 1. You pick whether you want a Burrito (flour or wheat tortilla), Bowl (bed of seaweed rice), Salad (bed of romaine lettuce), 3 Tacos (soft flour or crispy corn). \n\nSTEP 2. Pick your meats. Huli Huli Chicken, Kalua Pig, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Fish, or just Grilled Veggies. \n\nSTEP 3. Pick your toppings. Seaweed Rice, Black Beans, Shredded Cabbage, Romaine Lettuce, and Grilled Veggies (for a charge).\n\nSTEP 4. Pick your salsa. Charred Pineapple Verde (mild), Mango and Roasted Corn (medium), Tomato with grilled Maui Onion (spicy).\n\nSTEP 5. Pick even more toppings. Sour Cream, Cheese, Lettuce, Jalapenos, Cabbage, Lime, and Guacomole (for an extra charge).\n\nOf course you can put any or all of the toppings on to your entr\u00e9e selection. I can also describe how all this tastes, but that just wont do it justice. You need to come here and sample their product, which they will happily give to you.\n\nLast but not least, finish it off with Coconut Bark. A salty and sweet concoction that will make your sweet tooth want to jump out of your mouth and make a residence here. This is their only dessert option but honestly, that's all you need.\n\nChris, the owner who was just behind the counter helping make orders, was also walking around bussing tables and talking to every customer that was there making sure everything was ok. When he came up to me, I had all sorts of questions for him and to my surprise, he answered every one of them sincerely. Things like more promotional menu items like Shrimp and Kalbi Ribs for starters. I was impressed by his honest response to any and all criticism that I had. That's the type of owner I like. One who listens to their customers and takes things to heart. Now if this is how the owner acts, I can only assume all his employees will have the same positive attitude.\n\nSome random info. At the time of this review there is a 20 dollar for 10 Groupon so take full advantage. They have free wifi and the code is on the wall above you when you come in. On Sundays, if you come wearing sandals or flip flops, you get free chips and salsa with your order. They take cards. Their dining room is spacious and equipped with napkins and some kind of good tasting Hawaiin sauce. They have two separate solo bathrooms for men and women.  And lastly, they have a drive thru!\n\nSo a big mahalo to Chris and his staff. You just got yourself a customer for life!"

It takes traditional Hawaiian meats and combines them with Tex Mex's tacos, burritos, and bowls.\n       - Chipotle - I'd describe this place as a Hawaiian Chipotle. The menu and ordering style is the same. The flavor however, is different.\n       - Rice - Rather than the normal cilantro/lime rice at Chipotle, they have rice with sprinkles of seaweed. It's quite delicious.\n       - Taste - If you're not sure which meat to get, I'd recommend asking for a sample, that way you're knowing what you're getting into.\n**Ordered**\n       - Huli Huli Chicken - I can't get over how flavorful and perfectly cooked this chicken is. I went with an actual Hawaiian who told that Hawaii Huli Huli Chicken was one of the pinnacles of Hawaiian food and she said this chicken ranks up there as well.\n       - Kalua Pig - Kalua Pig usually is pretty salty. This one is no exception. It goes well in a bowl, but I wouldn't recommend it in a burrito.\n       - Pulehu Steak - The steak seemed a little under seasoned. It might of been since I had the Kalua Pig first.\n       - Grilled Fish - The grilled fish tacos we had were delicious. The fish was flaky and cooked to perfection.\n       - Coconut Bark - Unfortunately, I didn't like this as much. It's a lot of chocolate and was a bit too rich for me. A couple bites and I was going into a sugar meltdown.\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd recommend this place if you like Hawaiian fusion or Chipotle. It's an interesting change and delicious."

I loved thought the Kalua Pig was seasoned really well and it went well with both salsa.  They offer several toppings to spice up your dish that include sour cream, romaine lettuce, cheese, jalape\u00f1os, cilantro (which I LOVE), cabbage, and guacamole with pink Hawaiian salt (for a little extra).  Yes, I got the guacamole and it was wonderful and I feel like I have to get it next time I go back as well.  \n\nAlso, since we had a little bit extra on our Groupon we also sprang for the Coconut Bark on recommendation from one of the workers.  Now don't get me wrong, I like something sweet every now and then, but this was way past my sweet limit.  I'll be skipping this in the future, but if you REALLY LIKE SWEET than this might be the perfect dessert for you.\n\nI'm excited to go back in the future to try out their other meats and combinations.  I totally recommend this place and really you can't go wrong with Hawaiian Food or Chipotle like bowls/burritos!!\n\n\n*FYI* there are no trash cans so don't wander around trying to find one like I did.  The servers bush everything and even packed my leftovers for me."

It always seemed clean & the people who served us were always so kind. However, one experience had me thoroughly disgusted. It was an empty lobby and we grabbed our food to sit on the booth area which was unoccupied. After I finished eating, I looked to my left and next to me was a roach that just appeared (since it wasn't there when we sat down). So, obviously I felt nauseous because it's not a sight you want to see after you eat. We told the front cashier and his reaction surprised me. He simply said \"Oh ok.\" As if roaches are a typical issue for this restaurant. And as we grabbed our stuff (while I felt like throwing up), he stood there waiting for us to move so he could get it. He didn't apologize or say it doesn't usually happen or that it wouldn't happen again. Good food, nice staff (usually), but never coming back again and warned everyone else I know."

The Hawaiian influence on the flavors took me back to one of my favorite vacations in Maui.  I have never had fish that was so fresh and moist.  The fish at competitors is always dry and bland.  Coconut Bark is a must have. I bought some to bring back to Colorado and ended up eating it before I even left the city. I'm glad I could buy the bottled sauces so I can add the amazing flavor to some of my dishes at home.  I wish there were 10 stars, that's what I would have given Bradduh's."

So far, I've tried the kalua pig (pulled pork) and the huli huli chicken bowls (gotta have the bowls!).  Both have great quality to them- the kalua pig has that perfect texture, it's not too wet but still very juicy and flavorful.  The huli huli was my favorite.  The chicken doesn't have that thick layer of fat lots of places like to keep on there, was all juicy meat.  All the veggies used were fresh, which can make or break dishes like these.  Now their coconut bark, mmm... It's sort of a soft brittle with chocolate and coconut.  Try it!!\nThe staff really have that aloha spirit for ALL of their customers, not just the ones from the islands.  They also let you sample their meats in case you've never had them before!  I totally recommend this place!"

            "review": "The best way I can describe Braddah's is like the end result \"nine months in the making\" of Chipotle, Pieology, and Subway vacationing in Hawaii and getting a bit frisky amongst the tropical oasis?!?\n\nIt has your typical trendy step by step process of selecting your meal like the three restaurants above and in this case there was five which had me a bit taken back at first, but everyone who's dined that way is trained enough by now to take even that like a champ.\n\nFaced with the choice of burrito, bowl, salad, three tacos, or nachos it certainly was a task, but I figured in order to get the full overall experience the taco route was the best way to go. Perhaps I'll do a burrito or nachos next time to further the experience.\n\nI then moved on to the selection of the meat and not wanting to focus on just a single meat I did all (Kalua pig, Huli Huli chicken, and Pulehu steak), but the grilled fish sounds like a crowd pleaser as well yet seems easily forgotten when stacked up against a triple threat like that. I'll invest in a potential fish taco next stop so I can truly say I've tried it all.\n\nI will pause to discuss the highs and lows of each protein as unfortunately it was not as consistent amongst each as my heart anticipated. Hands down my favorite was the Kalua pig, truly a high recommendation here. I found it to be melt in your mouth tender and did make me reminisce of the paradise cove luau in Oahu so how's that for authentic? \n\nI was however left to desire that same experience with both the Huli chicken and Pulehu steak. I was mentioning to my wife that the seasoning was clearly there partnered with the slightest char taste radiating off each bite were impressive, but where things fell flat for me was the fact that both tasted a bit tough and if they had been more moist and tender it'd surely even have made King Kamehameha himself lick his chops over and over again!\n\nThe remaining three steps is the traditional topping overload (rice, beans, veggies, etc.), but the highlight for me here was their charred pineapple verde. There are a few other salsa choices here (mango and roasted corn or tomato w/grilled Maui onion) and maybe for round #2, but this one again was a party pleaser. I don't quite know what exactly it was about it, but the sweetness from the pineapple and light hint of char worked very well with the mixing of all that went in the taco. Another must try here for sure!\n\nAlthough it wasn't consumed until the following day I want to bring honorable mention to the coconut bark as it left both us howling at the moon..the bark itself was soft and flaky, but throw some silky butterscotch layers on top of it and you'll be saying aloha in no time. I'm glad the cashier lead us to this vs. the regular bark as it took the meal to an all time level!\n\nSo all in all, (to play off of the rainbow road location) I can say Braddah's is certainly a pot of gold after it hands down. Even after all this time I can honestly say my lucky charms are salivating at another chance to consume some of this cuisine all over again!"

The meat/vegetarian choices include huli huli chicken, kalua pig, pulehu steak, grilled fish, or veggies.  My personal favorite is the grilled fish, which is packed full of flavor despite the nondescript name.  Now here is where it gets interesting, you get to choose one of their yummy salsas to top your creation.  Their current salsa list includes charred pineapple verde (mild), mango/roasted corn (med), or tomato/grilled maui onions (spicy).  My favorite is the tomato/onions salsa, however I wouldn't call it spicy by a long shot.  All of the other standard toppings are available, such as cheese, sour cream, lettuce, beans, etc.  They also offer jalapenos, which is a nice surprise!\n\nMy only complaint is their rice, it's quite dense and heavy.  I wish they offered a choice of something fluffier.\n\nIf you're not too full, you must grab some of the coconut bark dessert.  Screw it, even if you are full just grab some for later.  Be warned my friends, this stuff is more addictive than crack!\n\nBraddah's often runs Groupon and/or yelp deals, so check both before you go to save a few bucks."

The kalua pig, chicken, and fish were great. Steak was too sweet for me. My main complaint is that it was too cold in the building! Had my peacoat, north face jacket, and sweater on (three layers!) and was still freezing. Other than that, the food and service was great. A must visit if in Vegas!"

They let me try a few of the meats prior to ordering. The steak was juicy and full of flavor. The chicken wasn't anything short of amazing and the Kailua pork nearly melted in my mouth. I couldn't pick just one for my tacos so I got one of each. The staff recommended which condiments went best with each meat and I must admit they were spot on. \n\nNow the reason that sets places apart from the pack, the staff. The staff was extremely welcoming and engaging. They had tons of recommendations for the food as well. The owner was behind the counter and extremely friendly. I am always impressed when the owner is present. He came out and talked to all the customers. You could tell he takes pride in this place. \n\nI will be back often."

Extra star is solely for the coconut bark!\n\nFirst time I heard of this place I thought.. Hawaiian Mexican fusion that's freakin awesome! I was pretty intrigued because I do enjoy both of these ethnic foods. & the pictures made my mouth water. \n\nIt pretty much has a Chipotle feel to it. I got a chicken bowl w/ seaweed rice, mango roasted corn, tomato grilled maui onions and a ton load of lettuce. Although I did enjoy the meal I didn't give it more stars because after the meal I didn't feel like I wanted to come back right away. All i really keep thinking about was how much I want that coconut bark. & not so much the actual food they have. Next time I'm gonna go for the steak. NIeves D. gave me a lil sample and that was way better then the chicken I decided to go with.\n\nThe staff is incredibly nice. The guy in charge defiantly hooked it up. Gave us free drinks & free coconut bark! YES!! \n\nThe side door was wide open due to a crack on the glass so all types of bugs were flying in & I thought that was pretty unsanitary."

Sarah told me this place opened up recently and I was anxious to try some Westside Vegas Hawaiian grub.\n\nOutside the building looks like an old Wienerschnitzel but inside it's clean and full of island flavor. Service was laid back and nice just like the islands. They let us sample some meats and the Kalua Pork won over my taste buds. The owner Chris was a friendly guy!\n\nKalua Pork Bowl - The seaweed rice is a genius idea. I'm glad it's brown rice too! The pork is better than many Hawaiian restaurants I've been to which cost twice as much. The sauces they offer were great. It's an awesome filling bowl packed with great contrasting flavors.\n\nDon't forget some coconut bark. Sure it's cold and firm when it's first taken out of the fridge but once it warms up, it's a Maui honeymoon in your mouth. Chewy gooey goodness.\n\nI like the little touches such as the stickers on the food containers and other odds and ends around the decoration of the place. Sure it's fast food, but it's gourmet island fast food and I'm all over it."

The set-up is taken right out of the Chipotle playbook, & why not, it's a great formula! We made sure to sample the meats that they had available especially since the guys are sensitive to spices. My Huz and oldest son had such a difficult time deciding between the Kahlua pig and the chicken, they went ahead & just got the mix in their burrito! I chose the chicken on a salad base & asked the counter server for suggestions on toppings. She was so friendly and my salad looked amazing & tasted just as well. My 9 year old stuck to a simple chicken burrito with beans & rice.  Like I said, the set-up is much like a beloved franchise, but it had a flare of its own. I felt like I was dining among the locals. And an added bonus, they are part of the eScrip program (you must register your credit card) & by dining here, you help raise a bit of money for the school of your choice (yay for my boys' school!) Thanks for the awesome meal, Bruddah's!

They totally have the same font all over the menu! If that was your guess, great job.\n\nI'm going to go against the grain and highlight what happened at the end of my meal here. After finishing my excellent food, I saw this purple and white ribbon pinned to the menu. I asked the manager (owner?) about it, and he quite proudly shared with me that it was for winning best dessert at the Bite of Las Vegas. He even boasted that they beat out all those fancy chefs who \"went to school\" to learn to make dessert.\n\nLoathe to let a great opportunity slip, I stepped up to the register and ordered the coconut bark. Wow. I'm not normally a coconut fan, but this wasn't overtly coconut-y. There's coconut shavings on a hard chocolate layer, then a middle white layer which was more likely coconut as well, and a salted soft caramel layer at the bottom. It's pretty dang sweet, which is too my liking, and isn't too hard to crunch through. Only problem is that I only bought one box and there's very few pieces of this deliciousness. After eating a chunk just now, I only have one piece left for another day.\n\nBy the way, the non-dessert menu is also worth coming here for. I had three tacos, and following the excellent idea of Christie L., I got to try three meats (huli huli chicken, kalua pork, pulehu steak), plus three different salsas. I'd probably go for pork or steak (just like at the other fresh burritos places) and definitely stick to the mango and corn salsa, but the pineapple verde and tomato with Maui onion options aren't bad. They also have two hot sauces available at bottles at the tables. You know I'm kinda a fan of sweet, and I found myself augmenting my tacos with quite a bit of the raspberry and jalapeno sauce. The unlabeled guava sauce was a little too hot for my delicate taste buds unfortunately.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent 4.5 star concept that the coconut bark certainly bumped up to an unquestionable 5. You will love Braddah's if you enjoy either or both of Hawaiian food and the fresh burrito concept. Hopefully, they'll stick to their goal of opening a Henderson location soon so that I can enjoy their food after a much shorter drive."

I come right at lunch time, and there are so few people working, some just hanging out. The drivethru girl wandered in at 12:30. The awesome bottles of sauce are gone. The past few times the bins of food are empty, right at the lunch rush. And no one to clean the tables off, as there is no place to set your dirty tray to make room. \n\nToo sad as it is quite a staple for lunch."

I have been everywhere and tried over 300 different restaurants in the united states and this is my personal favorite restaurant. The setup is simple and the food is downright fantastic! If i were to invest money in a growing restaurant that would go national it would be this one. The chicken is tender and juicy, the steak is marinated in an amazing sauce that makes the meat melt in your mouth, and the fish is pan fried to a nice caramel brown and flakes amazingly. The shells are nothing like anywhere else I have eaten tacos they too have a awesome flaky crunch about them. also this company makes awesome sauces that you can buy and go great on salads and other food you want to taste good. if you have not gotten over here you haven't tasted the wonder that this place will bring into your life! \n\noh p.s. the coconut bark will make you wish you never bought it, its probably the best bark I have had ever as well."

I got the Pulehu steak, seaweed rice, beans, cabbage, sour cream, tomato onion salsa (supposedly \"hot\"), corn salsa. It wasn't spicy and just needed something for some oompf with spice and needed a little salt as everything was underseasoned. There were 2 bottles on the table, a yellow sauce and one bright red/pink one. The yellow was tangy sweet and the pink was sweet fruity sauce. It wasn't what I was looking for so I kept it plain. The BFs bowl with the Kalua pig was way better as his meat was nicely seasoned and had a nice smokey flavor. \n\nThe second time we came was much better. I got the kalua pig and to get some of the spice I asked for some sliced jalapeno. Everything seemed better seasoned this time around, like the rice the last time was not salted. I hope that this keeps on, it was much more flavorful and was actually pretty tasty. Now, if they can make the \"spicy\" salsa actually have some bite that would be awesome. I wonder if their consistency is a issue, but I hope that this visits quality is more common and would explain all these great reviews.\n\nWe tried the coconut bark salty sweet noms this time too. I want some more! The box came with 4 pieces and I should have bought more. It reminds me of the saltine brittle my sister used to make. It has some chewy almond roca tasting toffee, pretzel, layer of chocolate with some coconut shavings on top.\n\nIt's on the way home, open after work so it will go on our rotation when we don't feel like cooking."

Sweet, salty, crunchy, melty, buttery, heavenly brown bagged morsels. We initially bought one for our family of 4, but had to buy another on our way out because it was just that good. \n\nAs others have said, it's a Hawaiian chipotle. Upon entering, you get an amazing sense of customer service already. They asked us if we have ever been before, and when we responded no, they gave us a sample of all the meats. I loved the flavors of the meat. I got a chicken and steak combo burrito on a WHEAT tortilla with fajita veggies, mango salsa, and the hot tomato pico salsa along with everything else. It was amazing and so big that they had to double wrap it. Usually, I am not a carb person, but it was the weekend so I killed that bad boy and easily ate my entire DV of calories. The steak has 5 slice and hoisin. It's sweeter than Mexican marinated meats but completely delicious. The food was plentiful and a plate of 3 tacos and my burrito fed us all. \n\nMy only complaint is that the food wasn't hotter. The meat in our samples were room temperature and I usually like my food scalding. We had 2 people come by to check on us, and were even given a sample of their holiday bark which was greatly appreciated. Perhaps it was just an off day, but I am so excited to come back and buy bags upon bags of coconut bark. I've already raved to my family about it and I can't let them down. See you soon!"

For a picky eater such as myself, the highlight is choosing what ingredients you want to put in your tacos, burritos, or bowl. I hate getting the \"Sorry, everything is pre-mixed\" or \"I just asked the chef, they can't do that.\"\n\nIt's very hard to find good Kalua Pork here in Vegas. Always either too dry or bland. Sometimes even watery, which is gross. I tried the Kalua Pork in the tacos and the bowl. Soooo delicious!! Tender, flavorful and juicy. This was honestly the best tasting I have had so far in this town! Impressive, knowing that the owner is not from Hawaii.\n\nPortions are huge, so definitely come hungry! I could only finish 2 out of 3 tacos the first time. The second time, I could only eat half of the bowl, and I didn't eat breakfast earlier or dinner the night before. The restaurant is clean and the employees are very friendly. The guy who looks like the manager or owner is always talking to customers and asking how the food is tasting. Nice to know that he cares!\n\nNext on my list to try is the steak or Huli Huli chicken. Hopefully they are just as good! Keep up the good work guys!"

It's not real conveniently located for us, but we were in the neighborhood on another adventure and stopped to see what all the fuss was about. We were greeted by a very friendly staff and were offered samples of the different meats, as this was our first visit. Braddah's has a similar set-up to Chipotle and Qdoba. I opted for a chicken burrito with lots of extras. The burrito itself was good, but didn't live up to the hype. I ordered a side of chips and \"guac\". The guacamole was great, but the chips were served cold, although they were served in a paper bag with the grease coming through, giving the illusion they were going to be hot and greasy. The coconut bark for dessert was pretty tasty and the staff was friendly and attentive. The prices were in line with what you would expect from a fast food restaurant of it's type. I might return in the future, if I'm in the neighborhood. I was a little dissappointed, admitedly due to the enormous hype I was hearing prior to my visit."

Checked my bookmarks for something unique near me.  I saw Braddah's was only .5 miles away - sweet been wanting to try this place for some time.  \n    We walked in and the manager could tell right away it was our first time.  He asked and we admitted yes we had never been to a Braddah's.  He let us taste the pork, beef and chicken along with the coconut bark.  They all tasted great now just had to figure out what we wanted.  Since all the meats tasted so good we got the 3 taco combo with the each of the meats on them.  Added guacamole to our 3 orders which was a very generous amount by the way. We also got the salad with chicken and a pound of that delicious coconut bark.  \n   We were getting this to go as the wife was home waiting.  I did note the inside was really nice and kept clean.  It was near empty inside which was hard to believe.  The staff was excellent and ensured we got exactly what we wanted the way we wanted it.  The manger was really nice and even asked us what brought us in.  I of course said Yelp of which he was curious as to what on Yelp made us want to visit.  I explained that I look at reviews and pay much closer attention to reviews by my friends whom I know to be foodies and trust their opinions.  The daughter said pics are what she mostly looks for in deciding what to eat - millennials they are so funny.  \n   The tacos were all very good.  The meat in each was week spiced, tender  and unique.  The taco shell was homemade and very delicious.  We had beans, rice, lettuce, pineapple verde and guacamole.  I devoured mine as if someone were going to steal them.  I must say they were the unique treat i wanted them to be.  The salad was on the small side and lettuce was very minimal.  It did have lots of the same goodies as the tacos but should have more lettuce.  I added some romaine and it was a much better balanced salad.  \n   The coconut bark is as good as everyone says in their reviews.  I loved it and may have to hide a stash from my girls.  Their prices are very reasonable and when getting the tacos it is a great deal.  If your get the salad you will be left wondering - where is my lettuce.  Hopefully they remedy that soon.  I am looking forward to trying a burrito for my next visit which will be pretty soon."

The phrase \"Chipotle Hawaiian Style\" was mentioned often so I decided to give them a try.\n\nMy first time was a few days after Braddah's opened their doors. I was greeted warmly by a young man and he offered me a taste of all three meats- Huli Huli Chicken, Pulehu Steak and the instantly famous Kalua Pig. All three are incredibly delicious. \n\nI ordered a bowl with Seaweed Rice, lettuce, sour cream, cheese and the PIg. Wonderful!!! But not enough. I ordered the same thing to take home. The young man who greeted me asked how I heard of them and I said that Braddah's follows me on twitter. He then said the magic phrase of \"I'm going to give you a free Coconut Bark for following us back\".\n\nThe Coconut Bark . . . .  can I properly describe it? A thick layer of salty caramel, a crunchy layer of cracker, a layer of chocolate and topped with finely shredded coconut. So incredibly mouth-wateringly scrumptious, it should have a legal limit attached to it. (Thank goodness it doesn't!!)\n\nI've tried the salad, the tacos and the burrito on other visits. My favorite is the flour burrito with Pig and Steak, black beans, lettuce, cheese and sour cream. I like the Charred Pineapple Verde on the side.\n\nThe drive thru is open until 11:00 pm which is great for those of us who want to swing by after work. I've been there half a dozen times already. I just can't get enough.\n\nWelcome to Vegas, Braddah's - please don't ever leave !!!\n\n**edited to add this update**\nThey've been open a little over a month, I've been there 9 times.

Anyways, so there we were just waiting. Honestly, I didn't really mind waiting but it just sucks that no one greeted us all that  time. They gave us slightly old food from the looks of it and then when we got it we found a hair in my tacos. I brushed it off and ate 2 of my tacos.

So far I have tried the chicken, pork and steak... I must admit, I LOVE them ALL! My boyfriend favors the steak with the corn salsa! I also love the chips and guac, but let's not forget the COCONUT BARK... OMG! I also like how friendly everyone there is... I will definitley be a regualr!"

            "review": "Braddah's Island Style puts a unique island twist to fast food. \n\nOrdering is simple: first start with your base of regular brown rice or seaweed rice (brown rice with seaweed), then you have your meats (huli-huli chicken, pulehu steak, kalua pig) to choose from, then finally choose any toppings (black beans, cabbage, bean sprouts, lettuce, and sour cream just to name a few). The guacamole, of course, comes at an extra price if ordered.\nThough their ordering style is similar to Chipotle's, these burritos/burrito bowls pack some serious flavor.\n\nI went with the classic kalua pig. I usually like to have everything mixed in (including both the pineapple and corn salsas) for maximum flavor. Everything balanced out perfectly. The pork was very succulent and juicy and went will with the sweetness of the corn and pineapple salsas. They gave out generous portions here, which I found to be super filling.\n\nThe coconut bark has a weird, yet addicting sweet/salty taste. Worth a try if you have a sweet tooth after your meal. They also have Hawaiian Sun products available for purchase, which are a perfect pairing to any meal had here. What better way to wash down a meal than with a can of Lilikoi Passion by Hawaiian Sun... I'm drooling just thinking about it!\n\nOverall, this place is awesome. Customer service was great, they have their own private parking spots, and they have a drive-thru option if you don't want to step out of your car.\n\nYou won't be disappointed here. The food's so 'ono (delicious)!"

The rice (especially the seaweed rice) was dry and crunchy.  The service was slow and the owner seemed extremely bothered that we wanted something even resembling island-style plate lunch.  Admittedly, we used the yelp mobile app to find it, saw the reviews, and dropped in without researching the menu thoroughly.  But with a name like Braddah's, you'd think it would either have a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere or plate lunch (preferrably both).  It had neither.  The food was bad enough we didn't bother finishing it and the owner's attitude was bad enough we couldn't wait to get out of there."

Yeah their Kalua Pig is that good. I bet if the owner made kind of a spinoff and opened up a full service Hawaiian restaurant that his Kalua Pig would be a big seller. Anyways, carrying on.\n\nService.\nManagement is awesome, they are the ones that greet you as you walk in and the ones who check to make sure that your meal is always on point. Carmella (assistant manager) is one of those people that small businesses need. Just an all around good person who cares about the customer, and just a good person to talk to. Ask for her when you drop in!\n\nFood.\nBasically the style of food you'll find here is Chipotle X L&L Hawaiian bbq but 100x better. Same process as Chipotle, pick how you want your meal taken in as, a buritto, a bowl, taco set, etc. Then your protein, you already know mines (see first line of review), and then the usual vegetables, salsas, and other exotic sauces. \n\nAll in all, this place is awesome. Decent prices, good food, and great service. 5 stars in my book, enjoy!"

I hadn't eaten since 11am so after 8 hours of work I was famished. I eagerly bit into the burrito and almost spit it right back out! The steak was sweet! Definitely not what I was expecting and I didn't care for it at all. I do have to say the burrito had lots of meat and it was filling. I just can't get past the sweet steak.

Basically, it's like a Hawaiian-flavored Chipotle -  choose burrito, bowl, or taco, then your fillings of choice.  The salsas sounded great. I don't know if they were having an off-night, but the salsas were very bland.  The meats are at the core of the flavor here but about half-way through my burrito, I had eaten all the meat and was left with beans, rice, and a bunch of guacamole.  Kalua pig quesadillas were great and tasted better than the trio of tacos and burrito.  We were given some coconut bark to taste, and they were awesome. It actually looked like soda crackers coated with caramel and chocolate topped with coconut.  Very good dessert.\n\nThey are definitely generous with their guacamole, and the staff up front were helpful and gracious.  We did notice that when an order was put in for our grilled fish, one of the grill guys rolled their eyes, which made us feel a little apprehensive about quality issues.\n\nIn the end, the food was okay (nothing to write home about, except for the bark), and some of the service issues can probably be attributed to the restaurant just opening but one of the grill guys needs to check his attitude at the door.\n\nI hope this restaurant does well, but I think it needs to calibrate taste and distribution of ingredients in the food."

            "review": "Came here after buying their groupon. I got the fish tacos, chips and guacamole, and the kalua pig tacos.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and gave great service, they even let me try all of their meats since I had never eaten there before. I asked for some more salsa and sour cream to finish off my chips and they were happy to give some.\n\nLike other people have said, it is a Chipotle style place where you pick your meats, your tacos/bowls/burrito, and you pick what toppings you want. There wasn't anything special about the set up, but everything looked nice and appealing.\n\nThe tacos I got were pretty good, the pork was better than the fish.  My only complaint was that since I got the hard corn tacos, the bottoms were soggy when I started eating them. This happened for both the kaula pig and fish tacos. This was while I ate inside the store, not driving them back home or something.\n\nThe chips and guacamole were just what would be expected from a place like this. The guacamole tasted like it was made recently with big chunks of avocado. The chips seemed to have been fried recently with bits of salt still on them. Both of them paired together was pretty good.\n\nAll in all, while nothing was particularly bad, nothing stood out as particularly memorable. I think if someone made me eat the food with a blindfold on and didn't tell me it was Braddah's, I would have thought I was eating Chipotle.  I think I got my money's worth for it being a groupon deal. While I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here again, I would more inclined to eat here without a groupon as compared to other places that promote a groupon."

My 18 month old daughter's kalua pork taco had so much meat, it was enough for 2 meals!!\nNot to mention extremely friendly staff! We were excited to come back. We figured \"If take out was this good, maybe dining in would be even better!\"\n\nFast forward to today-\n\nWe get inside the restaurant and discover that it's a Chipotle style assembly line kind of deal. No biggie...if the foods delicious, I don't mind!  We order bowls this time instead of burritos.  Big bowls...skimpy portions. Our bowl was BARELY 2/3 full. If that's your portion size...please get an appropriate size bowl!!  My daughter got the same taco from last week but  this time it was a pathetic, anorexic version of the one from last week. Maybe a spoonful of meat. They charge $3 for a kids taco and APPARENTLY $1 more for meat. That's $4 for basically nothing!  Not to mention the menu was confusing as hell in regards to the kids taco. I'm sure we're not the only ones to find it confusing and a bit of a rip off. Now what happened in a week to cause this drastic change? The staff wasn't nearly as nice as before. Although the manager did try to remedy the situation and gave us a refund on the taco.  The food wasn't nearly was good as before. Bland, and not very hot.  I'm especially bummed because this was our \"cheat\" meal after eating healthy all week. Last week I was going to be a regular customer...after today...not so much...\n\nP.S. Hawaiian food is supposed to  be tasty, big portions of deliciousness. The portions today were for the price they charge... Insulting..."

Questionable prices, but good food and decent service.\n\nLong: I want to really like this place, but it's not doing itself any favors.\nI came here since I've been seeing its coupons on several sites, and yelp had a $5 for $10 coupon up, so I snagged it and came here.\nI arrived a bit early, and they were still setting up. In the meantime, they offered me a sample of their meat and I took it up. I haven't had this type of service for a long time. Then they took my order. I got 3 soft tacos with rice and beans, and a drink. \n\nOn my tacos I got Hula Hula Chicken, Kalua Pig, and Palehu Steak. All were very good, but a few problems: 1) If you order a portion of your mean to be the Steak or Fish, you get charged as if your entire order was that--which is extra. 2) The Kalua Pork, while the best meat here, tastes like it's bathing in lard (which is good, kinda). It's just saturated with liquid fat, so do avoid if you're on a diet!\nI only got salsa for topping, and I tried the three different--free--salsas they had. The pineapple and tomato/onion salsa were overpowering and I couldn't taste the meat with them in the tacos. The corn one was good. They would be great on anything else, just not with the meat. Leaves me questioning if I should have left them out.\n\nMy biggest complaint of food is with the sides. I had rice and beans with the side, and they were TERRIBLE. \nThe beans were like straight out of a can. I don't know if they make their own black beans, but they taste like any black beans you can dump from a can.\nThe rice, while you can tell is made in-house, is the worse. It's some kind of white/wild rice with some of the shell still on it, with some \"seaweed\" spice. This would be great if it was boiled or steam loosely, if the rice wasn't made Japanese/sticky-rice style. By making it sticky, the rice turns to just globs of messy, weird rice. With Japanese sticky rice, this is great as the rice tastes clean, and \"pure\" (hard to explain). But with this, the rice tastes dirty and just unappetizing. \nAVOID these. Several other customers after me--more experienced--didn't touch them for this reason.\n\nI do have to give mad props for having apple juice on the fountain drinks. That's something I've never seen before, and I love apple juice!\nThey do have two side sauces, which taste like concentrated artificial juice drinks with some hot sauce in them. While good, just doesn't sit right with me.\n\nThe service, was meh~. You're served from the counter--Subway style--which means the meat and all the sides are sitting out the entire time, pre-cooked and all. Then, the service ends about there. You get your own drinks, and leave your plates on the table. For the price I would have paid--if not for the coupon I had--this would have been pretty bad.\n\nMY BIGGEST COMPLAINT: Price. I can't see spending $10.25 on what I got. Three OK tacos, terrible rice and beans, and a fountain drink, with little to no service, for $10. I just don't see it. I can dine out for that price, and get much better and more food elsewhere--just not \"Hawaiian\" style. With the $5 for $10 coupon I got from Yelp, it made it worth it, and I'm satisfied. I'm just moved enough to pay $10 for everything. \n\nCome here if you've got the groupons or Yelp coupon, or if you really want to try this place. Otherwise, I don't see the value in it."

            "review": "Good island style grubs.  I opted to try out the 3 taco meal on my first go at Braddah's.  For my three choices I picked the veggie, chicken, and fish options and had them put pretty much all the \"fixins\" on it.  I was excited to try out the maui onion they offered and it wasn't quite as good as I wanted it to be as I didn't taste the flavor I've come to know and love.  But, I looked past it and settled on the flavors of the veggies, chicken, and fish contents; the chicken being the best out of the three.  It's not very often that you find huli huli style chicken here in LV (unless I'm not looking hard enough, which wouldn't really surprise me), so it was a nice flavor to re-visit after being out of the islands for a while.  The fish was also quite grubbin' but I found that the guac and sour cream overpowered the taste of the fish and I couldn't fully enjoy it.  I'll put it down as a mental note to try guac and sour cream on my tacos next time.  Got to try some of the prized coconut bark and it is as good as they say it is (and I'm not much of a dessert guy so that's saying a lot).  If I had to describe it, the coconut bark is just like a Twix bar with a healthy infusion of coconut flavor and texture.  Try it out, I'm sure you won't regret it.\n\nOverall, Braddah's Island Style is a good grub option when you're hungry and jonesin' for a little bit of island flavor.  Braddah's style is reminiscent of back home but it doesn't quite hit the mark.  However, that is definitely not a bad thing as it is tasty and I enjoyed the lunch experience I had while visiting.  A Hawaiian-style Chipotle they say?  Pretty much a spot on description.  A solid effort from a promising spot.  I'll be sure to stop by if I'm ever in the area and looking to eat something 'ono. Just have to remember to dial down on the condiments and take in the flavor of the main dishes instead."

The kalua pig was tender and not fattier than what you would expect and the chicken was juicy too. You pick what you want on it (seaweed rice, brown rice, lettue, salsa etc) and they don't charge extra (like Chipotle) for cheese or sour cream. \n\nI should qualify the Chipotle statement it is the same in that you pick meat, what you want and what you want on it but I am not a fan of Chipotle so this place is much better. \n\nOn my tacos I had both the pineapple salsa and the mango salsa. Also, they had four different house made sauces to try, I didn't try the coconut one (that was the hottest) but my hubby said that it was pretty hot and he loves hot stuff. Also, we got the coconut bark. It was really sweet, good but not my favorite and I don't think I would get it again. Too much going on in the flavor profile and they didn't solidify their sugar while making it so I crunched down on granulated sugar. All in all a good experience.  \n\nI should have taken a picture but I was way too hungry and my hunger weighed out my priorities of posting a pic on Yelp - but I will say that the pictures the other Yelpers have posted was consistent with my experience. \n\nIf you haven't tried this place yet you should give it a go.

The salsa plopped down while having great flavor was sticky on the outside of the bottle and I hate sticky fingers etc.  So, I would have probably given 3 1/2 stars in lieu of 3 if these dynamics were different - however, not the end of the world.\n\nOne other thing worth mentioning, although I got one of each style of taco to make my three taco plate, the 3 steak tacos are like a buck more than the chicken or pork and I got charged for 3 steak ones.  I'm not sure how else they would have done that anyway since they don't have an option for one of each, so I'm ok with it - just be prepared if you go that route.  Also, since we're mentioning price, I came back a second time about a week later an didn't get the guac add on a second time around because I thought the charge for it was a bit hefty at $1.65 or so.  I made a big mistake not getting it as the difference was notable in the flavors I remembered from the week before.  So, cough up the dough and get the guac!\n\nOverall, a nice spot that I would go to again."

The portions are perfect for the price and the Coconut bark is delish!! It seems like the best bang for your buck is in either the bowl or the burrito. The tacos seems like you get less of everything but pay the same price. I love the chicken and steak with grilled veggies. If I could make a recommendation it would be to add a Mexican style hot sauce or salsa."

No more raspberry jalape\u00f1o, coconut colada pearl, guava & habanero, pineapple lime jalape\u00f1o (that was my main reason for being a fan!) I don't think I can return, not until I know they sorted out the sauce situation.\n\nHonesty, I think the pulehu steak is delicious, packed with flavor, and moist, also the tacos have a wonderful crispy texture - but without the sauce, they just taste naked. \n\nYou broke a sauce junkie's heart. :("

After reading the menu board I decided to go with the \"3 Tacos\" with 2 on flour tortillas and 1 on crispy corn. I was torn on which meat to choose for my tacos, so the man behind the counter said I could mix and match them. Cool! I ended up going with chicken, pig and steak tacos and paying the extra $1.35 for guac on them. A lot of places would charge for the guacamole per taco, but I was just charged the 1 price and got a generous portion on all 3 tacos. The tacos were delicious! The charred pineapple verde adds a nice flavor addition, the meat is tender and has great flavor, the tortilla was soft and good and the price was right for what I got. The guacamole is worth buying just as a side to have with chips, but I have to admit that if there was some sort of Hawaiian pink salt in it, I didn't see it or taste anything except for fresh yummy guac. Hubby had a \"Pulehu Steak Burrito\" and loved it, but found the size to be too small for his hungry appetite. I still had half of a taco left so I was very fulfilled! So full that I didn't even taste a bite of the \"Cheese Quesadilla\" priced at $2.50 (meat extra) that we also ordered. \n\nI also had to make room for dessert later because I got a bag of \"Coconut Bark\" priced at $3.50 to try. Whoa!! This stuff is addicting! I have never had anything like it before and honestly don't even know for sure what all was in it. It seems like a saltine cracker with a layer of brown sugar or caramel and then a layer of chocolate and coconut. Whatever it is, I want more! \n\nYou can eat inside, outside or even grab some grub from their drive-thru."

            "review": "Yes, yes, it is kinda like the Hawaiian Chipotle!  But the flavors at Braddah's are definitely unique and local to the Islands!  Me likey!\n\nThe family and I went for dinner one weekend night and were greeted with cheery employees!  We were asked if we had been to Braddah's before, then given a nice sample of their kalua pig.  Really like home!  So needless to say we stayed for a meal.\n\nBraddah's concept is almost identical to that of Chipotle's with their food-building line.  You start at one end and place your order, and along the way down the counter you choose what you want in your entree.  Menu items are very similar to Chipotle's as well, simple and easy to comprehend.  But with more Hawaii flavor infused into the menu.  \n\nChoose from your menu staples of burritos, bowls, salads, or tacos.  Then you go down each station to choose your protein, rice and/or beans, salsa, dressing (if you have a salad), and fresh fixing choices.  Then it all gets wrapped up or placed on real plates!  Kind of a nice touch, since it gives you that homey-type feel.  Of course you can get it to go if you need to.\n\nFor proteins you can choose from:\n-Kalua pig (damn yummy like out of the IMU)\n-Pulehu steak\n-Huli Huli chicken\n-Grilled fish\n-Grilled veggies\n\nYou have a choice of black or pinto beans, and the rice has either nori or furikake in it which is pretty good.  Hot rice, furikake, and shoyu...a meal in itself!\n\nFor salsa choices you get:\n-Charred pineapple verde\n-Mango & roasted corn\n-Tomato with grilled Maui onion (LIKE since I'm from Maui)\n\nDressings make for salads include a papaya buttermilk ranch, and a roasted sesame gingerette.\n\nFresh fixing items to include with your order:\n-Sour cream\n-Romaine\n-Cheese\n-Cilantro\n-Cabbage (great with grilled fish)\n-Jalapeno\n-Guacamole with pink Hawaiian salt (for a small fee)\n\nTons of flavor combinations!  Like a hula dancer in your mouth!  Hmm...that worked out better in my head then on paper.  I had a burrito with Huli Huli chicken, pineapple verde, tomato with grilled Maui onion salsa, sour cream, cheese, and extra romaine.  I thought it would be too much for the chicken to come through but POW!  That Huli Huli chicken tasted exactly like I remember from my 'hana bada' days (that's kiddie time to you non-locals).  Sweet, salty, tangy, just damn delicious.  Very good burrito, made even better with the Pickapepper hot sauce they get from Jamaica!  That sweet and heat flavor added some good kick to my palette.  I would eat jars of that stuff.\n\nWe also had a kalua pig burrito too and it was pretty stellar as well.  That smokey flavor of the pork complimented the rest of the ingredients nicely.  Good stuff.  Fish tacos were ono too, very comparable to the ones at a place like Wahoo's.  Fresh.\n\nThe only complaint I have about Braddah's is sometimes the servings can be a tad on the 'keiki' side.  Especially with the bowls and salads.  Please, most of us people from Hawaii are big!  I'm a big boy!  I want a big boy serving!  I can understand how food costs rise constantly.  I only suggest you put a bit more lettuce and rice/beans when you guys make a salad or bowl.  Tastes good, just want more!  So please, maybe pile over the top of the bowl!\n\nSince it was our first time to Braddah's we were given samples of their only dessert, coconut bark.  Shiz...this stuff is like CRACK!  I don't even like sweets!  Sweet, silky, crunchy, coco-nutty all at the same time.  Tasty explosion!  No wonder it won 'Best Dessert' at this past year's Bite of Las Vegas, well deserved.  If you like spicy, add a dash of that Pickapepper hot sauce on top (I kid you not), and be amazed.  Super yum-yum.\n\nI bought a Groupon for Braddah's so I will be back again sometime soon.  I thought the drive was a bit far for us so we would wait a bit.  Come to find out, another Braddah's location will be opening soon closer to us at Centennial in the NW!  Will probably be back much sooner now.  Mahalo Nui Loa!"

I liked them both, but I'm also glad that I did half and half because I feel like too much of either and I would've felt sick. For the meats you have a choice of their huli huli chicken, kalua pig, pulehu steak, grilled fish or grilled veggie.. then your choice of rice/beans/cabbage/lettuce/veggies. I picked the seaweed rice which I absolutely loved. I can't decide if I like Chipotle's cilantro rice or Braddah's seaweed rice better! For salsa, you have the choice of a mild charred pineapple verde, medium mango & roasted corn, or spicy tomato with grilled maui onion. I had the mild pineapple verde and my friend had the medium mango & charred corn... both of us decided that the salsas were on the sweet side (not really a fan). I did order the roasted sesame gingerette dressing on the side (they also have a papaya buttermilk ranch), and normally I love anything sesame, but I wasn't crazy for this dressing. \n\nI added cheese and guacamole on top... love cheese so that was obligatory. The guac... I prefer the guac from chipotle! It wasn't bad here, I just wouldn't order it again as there just wasn't much happening in terms of flavor. \n\nThey have canned Hawaiian Sun drinks here.. I had the green tea with ginseng. This stuff was so good! It tasted more like a juice, but it was still really good. Now I just need to find out where I can buy these little gems!\n\nOverall, I would probably come back.. but not on the regular like some of my yelp friends. It is good, not GREAT or anything aaaahmazzzing... but not bad/terrible either."

The fish was inedible. Possibly because when we came in no other customers were there and we literally got the bottom of pan leftovers. Not sure how long it sat there. Then we realized all the meats were not really hot. They were all room temp, which concerns us because of how long it sat out. Maybe its better to go in when fresh food is prepared and moving quickly when customers are there."

Immediately, I was turned off but I decided to go for it anyways. The girls working were very nice. One asked if I had been there before and when I said no she offered me a sample platter. The kalua pig sample she gave me had a huge piece of fat attached, but the flavor was decent. I ordered a kalua pig burrito and a keiki taco. The food was not bad. I can't complain about that and thats why I'm giving 2 stars rather than 1. However, the tray I was given my food on was dirty and had old food stuck on it. The table we sat at was sticky so we moved and that table was sticky too. The napkin holder was covered in grease and dust. The floor had food everywhere. The windows and soda station  were covered in greasy fingerprints and bits of food. The wall I sat next to even had food stuck to it. The flies, oh man the flies were the worst. There were 3 flies that I had to keep shooing away. It made eating really unpleasant because it kept landing on my son's food. If it wasn't 100 degrees outside I would have sat out there! It's hard to believe the kitchen is clean when the dining room was so filthy. I would recommend a good deep cleaning ASAP!

You go through the line and choose toppings for burritos, bowls, tacos, salad, etc.  The primary difference is has Hawaiian flavor. So don't expect the normal red/green sauce here. \n\nI prefer the pig here. It might be salty for some people, but it works well with the pineapple salsa and a bit of sour cream. The chicken is okay, but I was not a fan of the steak. If that's what you're going for, this isn't the place. They are on point with the pig though. \n\nBuyer beware, when you get shredded pork (or any meat), there's a lot of juices. So if you're getting tacos your shell/tortilla may get soggy on a to go order. I personally like to separate the tacos from one another to avoid juicy sogginess. \n\nDefinitely try some of the coconut bark. It's a delicious medley of flavor that won't disappoint."

I noticed a one star review where the owner and customer got into a disagreement on whether or not an adult ordering a kids meal was able to receive chips/drink as stated on the menu, and not sure if that was handled properly since if it is not explicitly stated that the kids meal does not include drink/chips if ordered for an adult or that it is reserved for customers less than a certain age, not worth arguing over what is implied or inferred (owner may have won the battle, but lost the war since a potentially loyal customer and future referrals were lost over something trivial, and I doubt this scenario would come up very often since the prices on the regular menu are fairly budget friendly and there is a nice yelp deal available as well).\n\nI was initially leaning towards rounding this to 4 stars due to the fact that I like the concept and I'm always in support of local businesses, but with the ratings already a bit inflated and if I were to rate it honestly in terms of flavor, it's not quite there yet.  Everything on the menu seems to read better than they taste including the salsas and the little bottled sauces which were seemingly watered down and my palate was struggling to find them with each bite, even after applying them directly onto an individual bite.  Hawaiian food is all about bright and bold flavors with contrasting textures and colors, and I felt like it was Chipotle with a mere Hawaiian twist whereas I'd rather be commenting that this was like Hawaiian food served in the style and accessibility of Chipotle.  Perhaps since they are a budding new business, ingredients need to be kept within a certain budget, but I hope to see them expand to have more interesting options such as poke, opakapaka, korean short -ribs, or spam as additional protein options in the form of nachos or their burritos/bowls, and something with a wasabi or taro element since those are all popular flavors from the island.  I didn't get a chance to try the well-reviewed coconut bark, but I don't think it would be too difficult to imagine coconut, chocolate, and buttery toffee to be a winning combination.  \n\nIf the owner is keeping up reading these reviews, you should feel proud that so many locals are supporting your product with 4-5 star reviews and building a local following, but I hope you're continuing to strive to improve and showcase your passion and homage to Hawaiian food and I hope to return at some point to dole out a few more stars.  For now, the bark is bigger than its' bite(s)."

I've eaten there three times in the past week and it is amazing!\n\nThe first time I had Braddah's, my boyfriend schlepped from his office clear to my place (about a 1/2 hour drive) with Braddah's takeout. Even a half hour later, the food was amazing. I was hooked. He brought me a Huli Huli chicken bowl with the mango-corn salsa, seaweed rice and black beans - the perfect post work-out meal. \n\nThe next time I had it, I went to the actual store on Rainbow & Sahara - excellent, quick service, a clean restaurant and very friendly employees. Try their hot sauces - the guava one is to die for, and everything is homemade, bottled and labelled by the owner. They even have a drive-thru which, while I haven't been through it yet, is just a fantastic idea. Healthy food on the go that's not freakin Subway? Love it. \n\nAwesome local joint for a quick, healthy and delicious meal - I can't wait to see them open up in Green Valley/Henderson so I can get my Braddah's fix more frequently! My only suggestion to them? Start a stamp card program like Cafe Rio has - I feel like my boyfriend and I would have filled a few cards by now!!\n\nQuick edit to say - eat half a bowl and save the rest for lunch the next day. This stuff reheats deliciously."

Kalua pork or huli huli chicken mixed with brown rice, black beans, cabbage, and mango corn salsa is my go-to whenever I'm close. The coconut bars are amazing but beware! You can usually get a free sample and that's all it takes to get hooked. They mysteriously end up on every order now."

I love the food, I love the atmosphere, I love the mahalo that they spread in return.\n\nIt is not your typical Aloha grinds place but take Hawaiian eats like kalua pig, huli huli chicken, pulehu steak, grilled fish and mix it up with a serving style of something to similar to Chipotle and you have Braddah's.\n\nMy go to eats are typically a bowl with a bed of seaweed brown rice, a mix of half huli huli chicken and kalua pig, black beans, cabbage, lime, jalapenos, bean sprouts, cilantro, and a mix of mango and roasted corn salsa and tomato with maui onions salsa. I also like to add on a serving of grilled veggies which costs you an extra $1.25. \n\nYou could also choose to add a pineapple verde salsa, lettuce, sour cream, cheese, guacamole ($1.65 extra) and salad dressing options from either papaya buttermilk ranch or roasted sesame gingerette. I am a fan of both salad dressings too.\n\nAnd the kiddos are not left out here either. They have a kids menu as well that comes with a drink and chips, we also go with a nice cheesy quesadilla. \n\nYou can opt for other options instead of a bowl, you can go with 3 tacos, salad, bowl or burrito. You can double your meat for around $2 I believe. The burritos are huge here FYI. You definitely get your money's worth.\n\nThe food is solid. I might have to add a little salt and pepper to my bowl but I leave with a full and more importantly a very happy belly. \n\nLas but definitely least, the best part of my eats are the dessert. They have this amazing salty and sweet coconut bark and it is just love. pure love. They had a holiday bark around Christmas time which in my opinion was better than the regular coconut bark and I anticipate the return of it again. Either way the bark will break da mouth. It is that good.\n\nI think I am going to have to go again today after writing this review. I need some Braddah's."

I came here about a month ago and I noticed the little areas around been here a few times and have really only have 1 good experience and that was when its first opened up 2 years ago or so. I came here about a month ago and I noticed the little areas around the counter area had dried on disgusting grease. I was super appalled, and felt super bad because there were only two girls working at the time. That visit I saw the meats that were offered, and the girl offered to give me a sample of each. The beef definitely had been sitting there for at least an hour because it was now basically carmelized meat. The chicken was super dry and there wasn't but a spoonful left. And the pork was blah. \n\nFast forward to today, it was around 6:30 pm and we went in to order dinner. The place was dead, just like it was the last time we went in, but this time there were three girls working. Once again I go to the counter and see it's still disgusting and dirty right by where they keep the plates and bowls and I'm assuming it's a microwave or something. So I ordered the kids chicken bowl and a half pound box of the bark. Again the beef and the chicken look like they had been sitting there for at least an hour, the fish was also uncovered and there were flies around the food. I decided to go with the brown rice with the chicken for my kids bowl. When she actually gave me the scoop of chicken it was pitiful, then she put on some cheese, lettuce, jalapenos, sour cream, and some cilantro that looked like it had been there for at least 2 hours. When she rang me up the total came out to 17 dollars and change, I asked her why the price was that much, and she said the child's bowl was $5.95. Now I don't mind paying $5.95 for a kids meal, but I want to pay that much for a meal, not a tiny ass rice bowl. I didn't have it in my heart to tell her I did not want it after all, because it was already made, and I was already getting irritated. When I asked the price breakdown of the $5.95 she said the bowl itself  is $3.95, and to add the chicken it's an additional $2. Now that 2 dollars would have been fine if it was a large heaping scoop of chicken that hadn't been sitting there for the majority of the evening. But this was not that, this was a half of a scoop of dried up funky ass chicken. I hadn't really paid attention to the size of the bowl so I paid for my food and left. \n\nUpon getting home I became even more irritated! I could literally almost wrap my entire hand around the $5.95 \"bowl\" that I bought. Keep in mind, this $5.95 price tag does not include any drink or chips or anything else. It's just a small ass bowl. I get that it's a childs portion; but I wouldn't even call it a bowl its more like a soap dish full of rice. And, a regular sized bowl is only $1 which I failed to notice until the end!\n\nI don't think I will be returning, I've come here a few times, but things have just steadily gone downhill. This is not a Chipotle of any type! Chipotle is not this disgusting, nor has their food ever sat for over 30 minutes marinating in its own grease. So please stop comparing it to that, because it's definitely, definitely not that. I really think that they need to reevaluate the pricing, because for what you pay you can literally go and buy yourself a meal at another place and have fresh delicious food. In fact I had to go next door to stupid McDonalds just to purchase a side of french fries for that child's bowl accompaniment. They were extremely fresh and hot and even though extra fattening, they were delicious. \n\nI guess instead of complaining of the shit food, I'm gonna practice what I preach and go elsewhere. \n\nBoy bye!"

Steak & chicken is good, if you're not used to Hawaiian flavors it has a tad sweetness to it (a little like teriyaki) so if u don't like that flavor then go with the pork or fish. I usually get the salad bowl, they always give dressing with it but u don't need it if you're adding salsa and all the other add-ons. I recently just tried the salad dressing and if skip it! Tasted funny. And I always get the spicy salsa with Maui onion, I tried the mango salsa and it was disappointing just bland. The coconut bark is worth a try to see if you like it but the price is pretty steep for the size ($4 for a tiny box with about 3 small pieces) a $1 candy bar at the store might be a better deal lol but overall a good place to go. So minus 1-star for the salad dressing, size of dessert and prices is a tad high."

Ordered a steak bowl, given in penitentiary-style bowls that tasted disgusting. States it is Island Style cuisine which is nothing but a bunch of white people pretending to be Islanders. When I went to pay after making the bowl, the front register knockoff iPad crashed after sliding my card. So the staff member took my card in the back in the back to charge using that register. Who knows how many time she slid my card because it ended up charging me over and over again. I  Ordered one shitty steak bowl and they charged me over and over again. Called the restaurant up to ask why and was basically told to fuck off by the 'founder' Christopher. He was so aggressive and completely blamed it on my bank even though he admitted the front register freezes up lately. He took no responsibility that this could have been his fault before putting the blame on the customer and their bank. Do not go through the headache of eating at this place. The food sucks, the staff is on another level of stupid, and the management is a nightmare. Cultural appropriation at it's finest. I recommend eating at Island Flavor on Durango. Wayy better than this piece of shit establishment. Wish I took a pic of the shitty food but have the bank statements attached! Be warned guys!"

I drove from the Mountains Edge area to sample their international delights.  \n\nFirst off when you walk in you could kind of tell that this place may have been an old Taco Bell.  But, hats off to the owner for trying to create that Aloha feel!  Anyhow, I'd like to make a quick comment about the service.  It was our first time here, and they serve the tacos, burritos, and bowls Chipotle/Subway style.  It's really good and invites a patron to ask a lot of questions.  However, the \"male\" serving staff that helped me was not the greatest.  The guy that was explaining the different types of meat to me wasn't very enthusiastic about any of them.  I know they serve fish as well, because of the Yelp reviews but he didn't ask if that was an option I'd like to try.  \n\nThe food it self was tasty and inventive.  I got the Huli Huli Chicken, Kalua Pig, Puleha Steak tacos with Mango & Roasted Corn Salsa on flour tortillas.  The Kalua Pig taco being my favorite!  However, I kept to things that \"looked\" familiar like the Mango & Roasted Corn Salsa.  I wasn't ecstatic about my meal but it was just, good.  What really held down it's reputation was the Coconut Bark desert.  It's really hard to explain.  But, we had friends that hated coconut shavings.....and loved it!\n\nSo, my suggestion to this place is to have a staff that is more suggestive.  Honestly, my food was pretty good but, kinda tasted like Chipotle.  It was my fault for not trying something different but, the staff also wasn't helpful.  You really need a staff that can put you in the right direction when trying something new and inventive.  I hope to try this place one more time but, usually the first visit makes the most impression on that decision to go again."

Well good question I say.\n\nI LOVE Braddah's because all their food is made fresh daily (and I do mean everything). You can customize your burrito, taco, and salad bowl the way you like it. Everyone is just so darn friendly that works there you want to stick around long after you consumed your meal. \n\nMinh and I arrived here on a late Thursday afternoon for some lunch. We were looking to stick to the healthy side of things. \n\nWalking in we were greeted immediately by not only the girl behind the counter but also by the owner Chris. We were asked if we have been to Braddah's before we both said no. The lovely cashier then explained to us their menu and gave us a sample of two of their popular meats (Huli Huli Chicken and Kalua Pig) wow the flavors were mouth watering making me want more! But how can I choose! So instead of ordering their \"popular\" meats I decided on trying their Pulehu Steak (which I think should be on their sample list too). Chris was so kind that he stopped what he was doing and came over to make my bowl (which I did not expect) \n\nI ordered a salad bowl: Pulehu Steak, Black Beans, Romaine Lettuce, Cheese, Lime, and Guacamole. There are also three kinds of homemade salsa to choice from since I did not know which one to choose Chris gave me a little of each in my bowl to try. (I loved all three of them)\n\nWe also ordered their Award Winning box of coconut bark to take home with us.\n\nThe dining room was super clean and every table was well stock with napkins. On each table, they have flowers, which is a nice touch and made my photo taking even better. \n\nI can't tell you enough times how amazing and flavorful my bowl was, I also can't tell you how happy Minh was with his food either! This is one of the best gem's Vegas has and I am a little jealous that we do not have a location out here in OC.\nI was full, but not that overly full feeling that you usually have after eating umm let's say cough chipotle cough. I even had enough room to break open that box of sweet coconut bark.\n\nOh tasty sticky gooey slice of heaven where have you been all my life?

Make sure you ask at the register if they are put out so you don't have to make an extra trip if they aren't.  I use them instead of the salad dressing to save calories and I am not missing a thing!\n\nThe ambiance and room temperature are very comfortable.  This is a nice place for me to hang out on my lunch hour while I savor my meal, catch up with a friend or just play with my phone.

Braddah's is not Chipotle.\n\nNice music. \n\nThe steak is delicious!\n\nThe owner is awesome.  When he is there everything runs like clockwork, the food tastes better, the sauces are out and the tables are bussed more promptly.\n\nHere are the drawbacks and why this place doesn't get an extra star from me:\n\nThe tables are often not bussed promptly which makes sitting inside somewhat not appealing being surrounded by many dirty tables.\n\nThe sauces are out for consumption maybe half the time.\n\nThe lemonade flavor in the drink machine is out half the time and it could be half-way through my meal before it's fixed.  Usually when the boss is there, he brings it directly to my table.\n\nWhen the boss is not there, the employees tend to rush the food-assembling process and/or are not listening so I have to repeat myself several times or ask for things they decided not to offer me (like having grilled veggies WITH my meat selection).\n\nI have also gotten slopplily assembled bowls by employees (setting the bowl down on other food before handing it to me or just dumping the wet contents, like beans, in haphazardly so that they spilled off the side).  Visual is important when it comes to food.\n\nOn one occasion the chicken didn't seem to be cooked quite enough.  Again, the boss was not there.\n\nThe north door is rarely open for people who park on that side.  Yet one can leave just fine out of the door.  It would be nice if they placed a sign on that door if it is out of order."

I can't find huli huli chicken or kaluah pig very easily at all- and here, both are phenomenally well done! Bonus points for generous portions, too.\n\nBut what makes this place really stand out, in addition to the tasty island flavor, is the service- when I walk into a place and am greeted by the owner himself, it means something to me. Chatted with the guy for a bit and he is clearly dedicated to this business and it's success- this is not another place where the owner is MIA and leaves a manager in charge of running things.

It was blazing hot in there! I found it difficult to enjoy my food because of the heat inside. I think it was hotter/ stuffier in there than outside...and this is Las Vegas so eating outside in the day while in Sept at 95 degrees is not a good idea.

They also have a pineapple green sauce that well Id eat on anything.  The meat is a little light so get the second portion.\n\nGoing back soon got more things to try from this place and the kids portions are 3 and change and I am eating my boys leftovers right now."

Hmm, the idea sounded intriguing enough to give it a try.\n\nLike others have mentioned, it's a \"Hawaiian Chipotle.\" The concept is similar to that of the chain where you select what you want (burritos, tacos, bowls) and choose your ingredients.\n\nSalad Bowl - I filled mine up with seaweed rice; shredded lettuce and cabbage; mango roasted and corn; guacamole; and pulehu steak. Unfortunately, the side dressing I chose was too sweet, so I had to finish my salad as it was. \n\nOther - What turns me off about this place is the sweetness of their condiments, from salad dressings to their bottled sauces. Aside from the food, the staff is friendly."

            "review": "Went to Braddah's for the 2nd time this week and can officially say I'm hooked already.   I was determined not to mention \"Hawaiian Chipotle\" for the fear of it being pass\u00e9, but really it turns out it's the best way to describe it.   I actually think they should have just fully played up to this fact by incorporating Chipotle into the name of the restaurant or something.   Hau'olipotle!   ChipotLEI!    I'll be here all week.\n\nOn my first visit I had a gameplan to get an order of tacos so I could sample all the main meats (Chicken, Pig, Steak), and even though they awesomely asked if I wanted to try any/all of the meats prior to ordering, I stuck to the plan and ordered the tacos.  Like you've read from other reviews it's just like Chipotle/Zabas where you start with a taco/burrito/bowl/salad decision and then choose meats/accompaniments to go with it.  On top of the meats I tried the seaweed rice, the corn salsa, the tomato salsa, and some jalapenos.  They also have the standard items like cheese, sour cream, guac.    I had the choice of crunchy corn or soft flour tortillas and went crunchy corn.   Of the meats the pig stood out to me by far.   The steak and chicken both seemed to have a bit of sweet teriyaki flavor to it which I'm generally not a fan of.   They tasted fine for what they are, but the pig was so juicy and flavorful that I've been craving it since that day.   The seaweed rice didn't really taste much different than regular rice, but maybe that was because it was on tacos and there wasnt much of it.  Most all of the other fixins I got were standard, which is not a bad thing but it leaves for very little to write about.  Pro-tip: the jalapenos here are fresh and extremely spicy.   I've already witnessed them leave a coworker in literal tears.   Be warned.   \n\nTo close out the first visit I tried some of the much heralded coconut bark.   This was probably ill-advised with my lactose intolerance but to add credence to the review I felt it was necessary.   You're welcome.   It was as good as everyone says it is.   So much so that you know when you're in a situation with a few people sharing several pieces of something, and it gets to that last piece and there's the tug of war of \"you have it\" \"no I insist!\".   I ended the tug of war after one \"no you can have it\" uttered by my friend.   So delicious it made me a greedy jerk.   Highly recommended\n\nThe 2nd visit I went to an all pig burrito with most of the same fixins I got previously.  I didn't really feel like my burrito was made all that well to be honest, especially when I asked for all 3 salsas and got them separated into thirds on my burrito by the gentleman making it.   It was almost too funny for me to even correct.   Are there people in this world who eat burritos like that?   I wanted all of them melding together throughout but instead it was like a salsa taste test.   Also the burrito just seemed really short and stubby and I kinda felt they skimped a little on the meat, whereas my friend's burrito last time looked completely stuffed.   It was still incredibly delicious and I can't really expect every cog of the assembly line to be consistent this early in the stages.\n\nI can easily see this being upgraded to 5 stars once it does.   In the meantime don't bother trying to trademark ChipotLEI as I've already got my lawyers on it."

            "review": "Island style Chipotle is the accurate description of this place...but perhaps with a little less organization compared to its corporate counterpart.  Okay, so I ended up ordering a quesadilla with kahlua pork and asked to have an adult size version of it.  I had to correct them twice that I would like meat in it when I was ordering.  When it arrived at the table, it was a tad bit greasy and the meat was all smushed to one side and not evenly spread out.  Also the exterior was soggy due to it being cooked in wrapped foil...I like my quesadillas to have a nice crunch on the exterior.  The flavor of the kahlua was good, but they also failed to give me any fixings like sour cream or guac to accompany the quesadilla.  My fiance ordered the 3 taco combo and I must say that looked more delicious than my order.  He tried the huli huli chicken, mahi mahi, and the kahlua pig and his tacos were overflowing with guac/sour cream/salsa.  As I was in line waiting for our order, I heard the lady behind me say loudly, \"kinda stingy with the meat, eh.\"  I turned to see what she was ordering and they put the two smallest pieces of fish I've ever seen in her rice bowl....eek!  If you are looking for value go with the tacos instead of the rice bowl...because she was right, they are stingy!  The coconut chocolate bark was just okay in my mind, but I'm not a big sweets person and this is SWEET! Overall, I'd give them another try since the samples I had of the other meats were delicious.  I probably wouldn't order the quesadilla again and probably won't order the rice bowl unless I feel like being a semi-vegetarian that day."

We cashed in on the Groupon and crossed our fingers. \n\nWhen we arrived the place was empty, but it was cute and clean. The staff was super friendly and gave us a bowl with the different types of meat to sample. I immediately fell in love with the kalua pig. I decided to make a bowl with brown rice, kalua pork, black beans, guacamole, sour cream, cabbage, and lime. I am admittedly in love with Mexican food and always intrigued by Mexican fusion and this was absolutely delicious. The flavors worked really well together and the portion size was huge. I am a guacamole addict and they gave me such a large helping that I ended up sharing with my husband (and I never share my guacamole). I especially appreciated this because there was an up-charge for the guacamole. We were also lucky enough to try coconut bark and it was spectacular. It was the perfect dessert with the gooey toffee and the chocolate. Yum!\n\nThis is a great fast food type option. The portion sizes are worth it and with Groupon and Yelp check in deals you can't go wrong. They even have a drive through! Support your local mom and pop shop and join the ohana."

            "review": "Due to a recent incident at this restaurant, it was difficult to give an unbiased overview since I personally will not be patronizing this spot any more. But here's a quick breakdown:\nFood quality: A\nCreativity: B+/A-, yes it's a knockoff of Chipotle but the food is amazing and the executive chef's new handmade, preservative-free sauces are phenomenal.\nCleanliness/quality of premises: A\nService/quality of staff (minus the owner): A\n\n I like the premise of this place: keep it simple, use a presentation that people are used to but with an island flair. And it works. There set-up is a lot like Chipotle: pick what style of food you want, choose your meats or opt for vegetarian and then pick your sides. And I must say, their Huli Huli Chicken and their steak are good and their Kalua Pig is amazing. And, as mentioned above, their Exec. Chef, I forgot his name, makes great/creative sauces regularly and there's a new one all the time. \n            I was definitely a fan of this spot and promoted it to everybody I knew. \nWhat changed? In short: the owner and his attitude/passive-aggressive demeanor. What happened: Myself, my gf and my brother went for dinner one night because I had been there 3 times prior and really wanted them to try it. We get there, order and everything is cool. Now, nearly every time I had come here, the sauce situation was different. The first two trips: they had like one sauce per table (a Pik-a-Pepper sauce I think) and the third time is when they rolled out these handmade creations. And each table seemed to have one of each of the handmade sauces. This particular time, none of the tables around us had any sauces on them. Since the sauces were like 40% of why I wanted to come back again, I looked around and noticed a rack with several bottles of each sauce. I figured: hey, they switch it up each time...maybe they put them on this one rack so they have to waste ingredients making a bottle of each sauce for each table. So I go and grab them for our table. Cool. A minute later, another customer in the same predicament went to grab sauces and was informed that those bottles on the rack were for sale and that there are bottles floating around that say \"Table\" on them for customer use. Of course, I and my group felt bad. But right after, the guy come over to the table and before he said anything, we said \"We just heard you tell them and we're so sorry...we'll pay for them. It's not a big deal, they're worth whatever the cost.\" His response: \"So the wasn't big enough huh?\" We apologized again as he was walking away. He came right back with a purple sharpie to right \"Table\" on our bottles, overtly suggesting that now he can't sell these and he has to use them for other customer. We apologized again and he said, with an obviously forced smile, \"Don't worry. I'm the owner, it's my place. I just want my customers to be happy.\" We replied, \"Are you sure, man?\" He says, \"Whatever makes you happy.\" I had been apologetic up to this point, but now knowing that he was manager kind of ticked me off. He left again, and then we looked at this sign...I kid you not...that sign was in like 10 pt font....we were the closest table to the rack and couldn't read it from our table. (Which btw, is not only bad for avoiding people misusing the bottles but also is a bad way to promote that your sauces are for sale). As we were finishing up, he comes back again with a new sign, still in 10 pt font, and put the sign ON TOP of the bottles, so nobody can grab them without seeing it. \nSeriously dude? We messed up, that was admitted and we were willing and able to pay for it so as not to cheat an up-and-coming business but your attitude and demeanor, for being the owner, makes us not only never want to come back but to warn the folks t o which we previously promoted your biz. If it was an employee that was rude, fine, I'd excuse it but I cannot bring myself to support a place when the owner was directly rude. Here's how it should have went down, even if we didn't offer to pay for them, you eat the cost of those bottles ($21), be cool about it since it was a genuine mistake, wait til we leave and then make whatever changes you need to. Instead, you have to eat the cost of those bottles anyways, but your passive-aggressive manner has now lost my business and others' as well. Your staff was amazing and really does embody the laid back and friendly island spirit...but you on the other hand...need to learn how to embody the \"Mahalo\" vibe that you aim to promote."

So i went and tried the chicken bowl and needless to say it was ok the chicken tasted the best out of everything else. Come to find out it was a mexican hawaiian fusion thing and that kinda does not sound right. So upon eating i thought it was not worth the $17 i spent on mine and my husbands bowl. They would charge extra for toppings and sides that could be put on top of your food for free. Overall i was dissatisfied with the food here and never again i will eat at this place! My husband and i already can forsee that this place will go out of business. I would say go to Aloha Kitchen where there is Authentic hawaiian food without the mix of mexican."

I don't know about you guys but when I get a burrito I would like all the fillings to be in every bite. I don't expect perfection because burritos are just amazing but imagine only getting a mouthful of rice or worse eating half of your burrito and realizing that there is no more meat for the other half of your burrito because it was all on one side of the burrito. \n\nSomething else.... I know avocados are expensive but if you are going to charge me $2.50 for guacamole please don't give me the smallest amount of guacamole you possibly can. I had to order extra guacamole on the side even then they didn't even fill the small container up. They did at first then scooped the guacamole out so it was more hollow in the center. Maybe I'm just used to Chipotle and expect the whole container to be full. \n\nHear our plea, Braddahs! We love you and love your food. The atmosphere and the food are what keeps us coming back. But for those who are interested the location on Maryland parkway is amazing and very consistent. \n\nP.S The young ladies that work at all of your locations are amazing."

We tasted each meat before we picked our order: the chicken was so much like a teriyaki chicken, the pork was awesome: juicy and tender. We had burrito bowls. However, once you had all the ingredients in the bowl, it just came out so under seasoned. Even their salsa were under seasoned not packed with flavors. I asked for 2 additional cups of salsa and a pinch of salt to make my bowl become ok. \n\nI can see the place become something awesome though.."

Now Marlin is great, he always accomodates me for fresh cut limes and sour cream so I don't have to worry about cross contamination with cilantro due to me being allergic.

It is definitely new and clean = +++.\n\nOverly excited as I am, it is my turn to order. The workers were totally great and helpful, asking if this was my first time at the restaurant, and they let me sample their different meats offered. After taste testing, I got half Huli Huli chicken and half Pulehu Steak salad, with Seaweed rice, black beans, grilled peppers (for an extra charge), sour cream, cheese, with their pineapple and also mango salsas. There were also 2 different types of dressings as well- and I chose to try both. The first was a Papaya Ranch, which was a creamy goodness. The other sauce/dressing was a tamarind base, if I can remember, which also was good and Tangy.\n\nFor dessert, I had to try their famous Coconut Bark, caramel brittle with chocolate, and coconut sprinkled on top. It was a tad bit too sweet for me, but it was definitely OFF-THE-HOOK!"

Why so many people stuff down nasty Mickey D's when all this fresh goodness is right next door for the same price is beyond me.\nThe building is very tastefully done. Nice seating area on the patio outside, and very bright and inviting on the inside. I love the old airline posters of Hawaii hanging on the wall, and the old Elvis music was relaxing just like you were in Hawaii for real . We were very warmly greeted by the employees with a friendly Aloha. Forgive me that i forgot to get any of their names, but they were all so friendly. What a nice change of pace to have such nice customer service. Since it was our first time, they offered us free samples of the Kalua Pork and the Huli Huli chicken. both delicious and full of flavor.\nThe ordering line is basically set up like a Chipotle if you are familiar with them.\nFIRST: pick from either a burrito, rice bowl, or 3 taco option.\nSECOND: pick you're meat. Kalua Pig, Huli Huli Chicken, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Veggies or Grilled Fish.\nTHIRD: Pick your toppings: Black Beans, Grilled veggies with green onions, Seaweed rice, lettuce, cabbage etc.\nFOURTH: Salsa Time: Charred Pineapple Verde(very mild,) Mango and Roasted Corn (delicious) and Tomato with Grilled Maui Onion. (Medium).\nLAST STEP: a few additional toppings such as cheese, sour cream, guacamole, jalapeno's, limes.\nNOTE: additional toppings do cost extra, so keep that in mind when building your meal.\n\nMy wife ended up getting the rice bowl, which was a really good size portion. She paired that with Huli Huli Chicken which is so delicious. She put on various toppings such as lettuce, cheese, and got the Salsas in a couple of small containers so she could put the right amount on herself. I can't remember what else she got because i was so involved with my order. Total tunnel vision lol. I went with the 3 taco option so i could try a few of the meats. I opted for the soft shell and got the Kalua Pig, Huli Huli Chicken, and The Pulehu steak. The Chicken is grilled and flavorful, the Pig is declious and juicy, and the Steak has a sort of sweet unique flavor like i have never had. i loaded them up so much, she could barely fold the tortilla. The food is flat out delicious and above all so very fresh, like you would make at home if you knew how lol. And whatever you do, don't forget the coconut bark for dessert. A sort of Hawaiian smore's concoction?? I don't know but it was ridunkulessly good. Nice piece of chocolate with shaved coconut on top, kind of a graham cracker?? in the middle and a salty caramel bottom. The salty evens out the sweet chocolate, and will turn you immediately into a crack-head for this stuff wanting to take a couple pounds home to stash for later.\n\nOverall can't say enough good things about this new restaurant. Excellent food, customer service, and ambience. We will be back again for sure!!. give it a try, and you will be so glad you did!!!! Mahalo and Aloha"

Have you every had Chipotle's, Caf\u00e9 Rio, and Qdoba? It's basically like those places but using Hawaiian inspired ingredients. Honestly I can see this place doing real good, I mean Chipotle and likes are pretty popular and Braddah's isn't that bad. It actually got busy after I got there.\n\nYou first choose what you want a burrito (flour or whole wheat tortilla), a bowl, a salad, or 3 tacos (soft flour or crispy corn). Then you choose your meats. They'll let you sample the meats, they were very delicious. They have huli huli chicken, kalua pig, pulehu steak, grilled fish, and grilled veggies. Then you add various non-meat items.\n\nThere was a Groupon which I remembered after I got there and quickly bought. I decided on two burritos. Burrito #1: Whole wheat tortilla stuffed with pulehu steak, seaweed rice, black beans, charred pineapple verde, mango and roasted corn, lettuce, jalapenos, lime, and cilantro. It was GOOD. Burrito #2: Flour tortilla stuffed with huli huli chicken, grilled veggies, black bean, tomato with grilled maui onions, charred pineapple verde, sour cream, lettuce, lime, and cilantro. It was also GOOD. Both of the burritos could've used more heat but that's just me. I don't think I've ate anything like it back home but I really liked it.\n\nThey are decorated in island themed things, with I believe a drive thru and seating inside and outside. The service is very friendly. Plus I saw that they're planning on opening more locations around the Valley.\n\nWeird, my big fingers gave them a 3 star rating. My bad."

And by 'Hawaii', I don't mean Waikiki Beach. But since they all eventually moved here to the mainland, I haven't been back in a while. I just don't remember Hawaiian food being anything like this at all. Maybe things have changed. Anyways...\nI kind of doubt that authenticity is the objective here. As many people stated, it's a Qdoba/Chipotle concept place with the Hawaiian theme. There are lots of interesting items you can build, such as a burrito, a bowl, and a salad using the basic proteins that they have. You then add on the extras as shown on the menu. No need to rehash what everyone else wrote. The server will guide you step by step. They also have a wide variety of sauces that you can use which I don't feel is necessary, because it seems to mask the taste of the food to me. Overall I thought the meal was quite good, including the coconut bark dessert of which you can ask for a free sample. \nThe service was over the top. They will offer you samples of all the meats and they will even offer you samples of sauces if this is your first visit. They will also insist that you try a sample of the coconut bark dessert and I got a coupon for a free 1/4 lb box of coconut bark with my next meal purchase. I make a big deal about service and even if the food may be just ok to some, this place deserves at least 4 stars."

If I say I've never been to an establishment, it's probably good to ask the customer questions to uncover their wants/needs to help them along and Carmelo did just that. She was very friendly and didn't have a \"I hate my life\" look or attitude that you get from many people working in the food industry. I was offered samples of the meat to assist I choosing the one I want for my soon to be amazing burrito. I used a Yelp coupon for the coconut bark which was BOMB. That thing is crack in bag. My burrito was under $10, got free bark, free samples, great service and I was full and ready for a nap by the time I was done. Note to self: Do not drive eating your burrito. You will drop rice on the floor and your shirt and you will be tired because you ate the whole thing because the guac and sour cream combo tasted so good with the meats and nori rice."

Both the steak and chicken taste amazing; still waiting to splurge on the kalua pig. Call me crazy, but my favorite thing about this place has to be that they carry cabbage as a topping option. Love it! And at last, dessert. If you're on the fence about the coconut bark, get off and buy it. Start with a 1/4 pound because you will probably eat the entire box no matter how big it is.

My Dad and I drove over and picked up 2 bowls for us and 2 for our girls. We all loved it so much that we ate here again before we left Vegas. \n\nAs others have noted it's like a Hawaiian Chipotle.  The meats:Chicken, Beef and Pork all were great with a lot of flavor and a decent amount in the bowls and burritos.  They even gave us a quick sampling of each when we all came back. The salsa had good flavor but was not very hot. Maybe it's because we are fire eaters here at the home of Chipotle but it still was good. I liked the crunch of the cabbage and bean spouts, it added a nice texture to the bowls. The fresh lime wedge helped to create a nice pop of citrus in your mouth to go with the other quality ingredients.  \n\nOn our first visit it was near closing time and when my Dad ordered the standard rice the employee noticed it was looking stale in the bin, called for another batch to be brought out to fill his order. I know almost all other restaurants would have just given him the older rice and not seemed to care, thanks for making your customers orders top quality all the time. \n\nDon't forget to check in here as the free coconut bark is outstanding.

The service line is easy to follow, the dining room warm and inviting - a little bit of Hawaii in the desert is a fun thing! Most importantly...the food. It was FANTASTIC and my only complaint is I don't live locally to be able to come here every time a craving strikes, which is often. The Kalua Pig and grilled fish are family favorites, but everything is fresh and delicious. I love crispy tacos and to have an option that includes hand fried shells...it is indeed a moment of perfection in my day. Don't forget to take home a 1-lb box of Coconut Bark with you and make it last, because you will miss it when it is gone. Finally, be prepared to be embraced like ohana - family - as the team here genuinely cares that you have a great meal and enjoy your food. Clearly, I can't say enough wonderful things about Braddah's, so get down here and fall in love for yourself...mahalo!"

I was greeted by the lovely lady that works here, and I felt so welcome! Knowing it was my first time, she offered me samples of the chicken and pork, two of the most popular meat options. I was torn because both were super succulent and heavy with flavor. \n\nI settled on the bowl option, which was piled with brown seaweed rice (flavorless but healthy) and pork. The mango corn salsa has a good kick in spice, which I would recommend. You have to notice what other options there are, i.e. guacamole, sour cream, limes, because they will not necessary list out what else you can put in your meal. The meat was STELLAR but the whole bowl itself was just a solid four stars.\n\nLastly, you MUST try the coconut bark. I was hesitant because I'm not a fan of coconut and they had their holiday peppermint bark option available, but I wanted to try the original... plus there is a Yelp check in special where you can get 1/4 pound of coconut bark for free with your meal. OH MAN. This is the best bark I have ever tasted, like everything is just perfect from the amount of coconut and chocolate to the gooey caramel on the bottom. Make sure to eat this while it's chilled!\n\nWonderful experience, and I'm jealous of all the UNLV students who have convenient access to Braddah's!"

It's like when you go to PTs or some type of bar and they have pancakes on the menu. You could totally order pancakes, but you probably shouldn't. I understand that you want to give people options but when you serve a salad the way they do, it's best not to. \n\nThe salad was on a bed of lettuce. Or so they said. I couldn't find much lettuce. I also got grilled veggies, trying to be a little healthier I suppose. Well technically, it is \"veggies\" as it was TWO types of pepper, green and red. They weren't grilled when I was there, so they were just cold and limp. It wasn't appetizing.\n\nThere was shredded cabbage and very light green and very light. I also got black beans, and when I did get a bite of black beans in it, it added flavor. I also got tortilla strips which I could barely find as well. Bean sprouts were in there. I also received guacamole (included in the price of the grilled veggies) and it was the biggest scoop of guacamole I've ever seen. Didn't help the salad at all, as guacamole is a transport or vessel for flavor, NOT flavor itself. \n\nI still like the place as their burrito bowls and tacos are very good. They have great salsas and the meats are very good. Stick with that. Other places like Cafe Rio and Chipotle do a decent job of salad. Those salads aren't your idea of the most healthy salads, but I can always recall seeing much more lettuce and greens in those salads than what I got today. \n\nDon't let this dissuade you from eating here at all, but just know that just because they offer salads, doesn't mean you should get it."

Big fan of the original location on Rainbow near Sahara, They haven't made it out to Henderson yet, but this outpost by UNLV is much more accessible to me. It's been open for quite a long time actually, but I only recently acquired a Groupon ($7.50 for $12, and maybe a Groupon code for additional discount).\n\nI was considering the burritos or the nacos, but I had the three tacos with pricing possibly based on the most expensive protein ($7.95 I believe, a slight recent price hike, for pulehu steak). I also had the grilled fish and the kalua pig. Pretty much had them do all the tacos the same way: wheat tortillas, seaweed rice, black beans, corn and mango salsa (favorite from the first location), shredded cabbage, cheese, cilantro, sour cream, and a'a chips.\n\nI found the steak to be a little sweet, the fish to be good if a little boring (maybe roasted vegetables w/ guac would be tastier for pescatarians), and kalua pork the tastiest of the three. I'm not sure if the a'a chips were around before, but the crunch was welcome. Probably had an oversight when I forgot to ask for lime, which would have brightened it up more.\n\nI didn't see any of the sauce bottles out, so after the first taco, I ended up asking the employee about them because they were available at the original location as far as I knew. She said I could buy one, which I wasn't inclined to do. Then the manager walked in and I repeated my inquiry. He said that they'd have them tomorrow and that the original store was making them today, and he also offered them for sale. I said I wasn't interested for now.\n\nWhen I sat back down, the manager asked out of the blue which sauce I wanted. The raspberry (with agave and jalape\u00f1o) was it of course. He then took a bottle from the fridge, opened it, and gave it to me on the house. Said that college students had been stealing them, and although he thought it was funny at first, it kept going and adding up. But I guess I either seemed like a loyal customer or I had some of my other purchases on the table. He even told me Merry Christmas. I don't know if the guy is Hawaiian, but I gotta give him props for treating me like ohana.\n\nFinally, there's those aforementioned other purchases: coconut bark. It's one of my favorite desserts, so I had to grab a small box of that, as well a similarly sized box of the holiday bark ($4.95 each).Both are crunchy but not too hard, and ridiculously addictive. The holiday version comes with white chocolate instead of milk chocolate, as well as some peppermint. Keep them in the fridge because they seem to soften if you don't.\n\nBraddah's has spread their version of Aloha spirit (and their yummy bark) throughout the Las Vegas Valley. Although I'm still waiting for them to show up on my side of town, this location should work for now. I was a little less impressed with the savory food, but much more wowed with the hospitality."

Chipotle is healthier (non gmo and no artificial ingredients, for those who are health consciious) so overall i choose chipotle, due to better veggie options and healthier ingredients.  Only way id choose braddahs is if it happened to be much much closer than chipotle."

Thank god we love coming to the Chewy Boba place next to braddah's, otherwise I wouldn't have found out about this place. \n\nThe idea of this place is kinda like chipotle and cafe rio. Where you pick out what you want whether it's a bowl, salad, burrito or tacos. Their toppings are SUPER different. But SUPER worth the try. You have the option of choosing whether you want brown rice (boring, but healthy) or seaweed rice (SO YUMMY, but not so healthy). They have different meats which consists of chicken, kahlua pig, shredded pork, or steak. The chicken is my favorite because it's seasoned just so right! Then you go on to the toppings, which they have so many to choose from! From lettuce, cheese, cabbage, jalape\u00f1os, banana peppers, etc! And then the sauces, which include mild, medium or hot, and THEN you have the option to put guacamole, and sour cream!! Oh man.\n\nI ended up ordering a bowl with seaweed rice, chicken, cheese, lettuce and cabbage and a touch of guacamole! Sooo yummy I tell you. I love the homey feeling of coming to eat at a fast food-ish restaurant. My boyfriend got the burrito which included sea weed rice, chicken, jalape\u00f1os, sour cream and guacamole. \n\nBut wait!! You MUST TRY the chocolate coconut bark! It's absolutely worth it! It's a desert that has chocolate, coconuts and a sugar that's hardened, but melts it your mouth. Be careful: it's Sooo addicting!\n\nEnjoy!"

Probably due to the fact that unlv kids weren't in school that day. The server was very friendly, asked if we had been there before, and when we said no, he gave us samples of the meat. \n\nThe ordering process is exactly like chipotle, pick how you want to eat it, the rice, meat, salsa, toppings... I tried to seaweed rice, and I was kind of disappointed that it was kind of flavorless. Compare to chipotles rice where you can eat by itself and it's still flavorful, you can't with the rice here. \n\nOrdered the steak bowl and the steak was amazing. Plus, with the yelp check in we got the coconut bark for free!! It was delicious and definitely a great way to end our meal. \n\nWhile still eating, a middle age man came and thanked us for coming in. I think he was the boss because he then said bye to his employees lol, and it was still just midday. That was pretty awesome for the boss or manager, whoever,  to actually drop by to say thanks!"

It somewhat makes up for their seaweed rice, which is always dry and pretty bland.. This I'd have to skip. Like chipotle, you can choose from burritos, rice or salad bowls, and/or tacos. Their \"toe-curling\" sauces aren't the best.. They are oddly sweet and taste like fruity jellies more than hot sauce. And the coconut colada pearl is.. Interesting and something you should try when you go. My boyfriend and I add their spiciest salsa to make up for the lack of spice.\nI give it four stars because the meat alone is great and the food tastes fresh. Also the employees are extremely friendly and accommodating. They will gladly explain items on the menu and let you taste test  the options before you decide which to get. Also UNLV students get free drinks with a rebel ID :-)"

Her hands were clearly dirty and she grabbed the OUTSIDE OF THE GLOVES! Hello, the gloves are used for a reason!  I told the young lady to wash her hands and get a new pair of gloves which she did without question. \n\nNow she has gloves on, waiting for me to order, she is leaning against the counter with her gloves on the side of it and everything.  She then makes my taco Salad and straight grabs the salad with her hands. Maybe the counters are clean I said to myself as I kept picking my selections. She then grabs a tray which didn't seem clean as a bunch of water spilled over as she picked it up and put it back down.  Grabs my bowl and sticks her fingers in it.  At this point I'm over it and would rather starve a bit and find another option than getting sick from improper food handling and safety. \n\nPlease train your workers on Food Safety!

From Kalua pork cabbage, to Lomi Salmon I am very picky when it comes to the flavors of my food.\n\nFor starters, the decor in the restaurant was very Pacific Island-y. The appeal of the restaurant and the atmosphere created a great starting point as we eat with our eyes first.\n\nThe service style is exactly like a Chipotle or a Subway. You choose your base, your meats, your veggies, and go. Liked the concept that the restaurant was going for, but I feel as if it was lacking in the *umph* factor. In other words, it lacked the value that makes me want to return to it.\n\nI myself had the steak bowl, and my girlfriend the Kalua pig bowl. The quantity that they put in the bowl was very inconsistent as I had a full bowl, and my girlfriend barely had a thing in hers. It's those little things that really ad up to the value of the food and restaurant.\n\nOverall, I gave it a 2-Star for it's concept, it's ambiance, and the location from UNLV."

Plenty of parking when we stopped by (+) and the restaurant was quiet with some great music playing and the dining room wasn't too full (+).  We walked up to the counter and were immediately greeted with a friendly aloha and welcome from one of the employees. She asked us if we had ever been here before and if we wanted to try any samples. After being given a piece of each of the meats we couldn't decide so I got 3 tacos (2 steak and 1 chicken) and my boyfriend got a bowl with pig, steak, and chicken. I tried the pineapple verde salsa and the roasted corn, along with other toppings and their delicious guac. \nThe food was nothing short of amazing.

They have a variety of hot sauces to liven up the food, but I prefer well-seasoned or spicy food instead of adding heat.  The rice and beans are unseasoned and the only flavor is the fishiness of seaweed in the seaweed rice.  The pork and chicken are good - the steak was way too sweet for me.  You might want to avoid sour cream and cheese with the meat dishes, as the dairy flavors with the sweet isn't so good, though it's good with the veggie bowl.  \n\nWhat annoyed me on the last visit and why I won't go back any time soon is that each time, I purchased a drink only to learn afterwards that the carbonation wasn't working.  They said they were going to replace it but didn't offer me a refund for the drink and instead said the tea and lemonade were working.  I didn't think to ask if they'd fixed the carbonation problem nearly a month later when I went back for a 2nd visit and purchased a drink only to get another flat Coke.  They also didn't put guacamole on my to-go veggie burrito (it's included in the veggie option), so I paid $7 for a wrap of bland rice and shredded cabbage.  Meh.

Unfortunately, they don't offer white rice here, which, I guess is cool if you're trying to be healthy but I'm really not a fan of brown rice. The seaweed rice really has an overpowering taste of seaweed (pretty good in my opinion) but if you have an aversion to it I would avoid it. and stick to the regular rice. \n\nTo top it off, I also got the pineapple verde salsa, guacamole, and cheese. \n\nThese all had nice flavors, but flavors I felt could have been pumped up a little bit. The salsa was a bit of a let down, it had some occasional heat which was nice but I expected the taste to have a little more of a punch to it. \n\nAll in all, the food is good.

Both orders just didn't have very much of a kick- sort of bland in flavor. Even the kahlua was a little bland. Boo. \nThe coconut bark made up for the meal. Order that!"

Since it's like chipotle I'll probably compare the two.\n\n1.You pick what kind of food item - bowl, salad, burrito, nachos, and possibly tacos.\n2. You choose your rice. They have seaweed brown rice or regular brown rice.\n3. Pick if you want black beans. Don't remember if they had another option.\n4. FINALLY you pick your meat: they have huli huli chicken, steak, Kalua pig, and grilled swai fish. This is the most important step. They let you taste the meats. The meat is seasoned well. The meat was actually my favorite part of the meal.\n5. You can add grilled bell peppers and onions for a dollar more & you can add guacamole for extra also.\n6. They have 3 salsas you can pick from: pineapple, mango corn, mango and Maui onion. \n7. They have a few other things you can choose to add like cabbage, lettuce, limes, cilantro.\n8. I don't know how this works but they have 8 other sauces you can use. They weren't laying around and the meat was so good I didn't bother asking the staff.\n9. The 2nd most important step is getting some of their coconut bark. Literally more crack than crack.\n\nI got a bowl, seaweed brown rice, half chicken half Kalua pig, grilled veggies, lettuce, black beans, and a mix of all three salsas. The portion was pretty big. I was scared I wouldn't finish it.\n\nThe food was great and tasted fresh. Nothing was over salted, but everything was well seasoned and full of flavor. I have to say I loved their chicken and kalua pig. \n\nI will say the salsas were a bit of a let down. I definitely appreciate the natural flavors & the gentle hand when it comes to salt but they didn't pack a special punch I was hoping for. \n\nThe girl working the counter alone was super sweet. She was definitely trained well and you could tell management cares about their reputation. The space was clean and the place is affordable. You can get a very filling meal that is truly unique for under $10 including a drink. \n\nMy favorite part is I didn't feel gross after. I didn't feel sodium filled or a food coma'd. \n\nI can't wait to go back and might be taking a break from Chipotle for a little while.\n\nI had put it at four stars but since I can't find anything bad to say I give this place a solid 5."

I've actually stopped going to chipotle since Braddahs opened because it's just so much better. My favorite thing to get is a steak burrito with seaweed rice, beans, Maui onion salsa, cheese, guac, cilantro, sour cream and some lime mmmmm also the pig is wonderful. The real gem of this place is the coconut bark, no matter how full I am from the burrito I can always eat a whole box of that lovely bark. Seriously try some!

U can just look at the spoon an see how crusty hard the rice has gotten. Same way with the meat. It's ashamed cause the cooks (especially Guy) make some of the tastiest meats on this planet. Unfortunately I now have to get shredded lettuce instead of rice. Been burnt to many times telling me the rice is fresh. Nothing worse than eating lil pebbles in ur burrito. Wich btw are huge!

I didn't catch the first guy's name, but my receipt says its Elijah! He asked if I'd been there before, and when I said I hadn't, glorious food sample hook ups galore! I sampled the pulehu steak and huli huli chicken, and liked em both, so I decided on a burrito bowl! (I can't eat pork, but that one smelled super good too!)\n\nI stuffed my bowl with...seaweed (brown) rice, huli huli chicken, pulehu steak, shredded cabbage, charred pineapple verde, mango & roasted corn, romaine lettuce, and bean sprouts. There were 4 different sauces that all sounded awesome, so I asked what he'd recommend and he suggested the papaya buttermilk ranch and raspberry with agave and jalape\u00f1o, and gave me both. (They were amazing, and I'm usually not even a fan of papaya. :o ) My ginormous bowl had generous portions, and cost just a tad over $8.50.\n\nThey (I say \"they\" because I also met Josh, who was the other guy working there!) also have a rather awesome flier with all sorts of wonderful deals, so I used one of the coupons to get a free side of guacamole with Hawaiian pink salt. I'm of the belief that guac makes everything in life better, and this was no exception. The music they play puts me in a good mood too. :D!\n\nThey also hooked me up with free samples of the coconut bark (milk chocolate & coconut with caramel, toffee and graham cracker) and their limited edition holiday bark (peppermint & white chocolate with caramel, toffee and graham cracker)! I bought a small box of the coconut bark to share with my friends, and will be sending em' this way! \n\nIf I'm ever back in Vegas, this is definitely where I'd opt to eat, and I strongly suggest that you do the same!"

So we walked there; took us less than 5 minutes. \n\nWe got there towards the end of the night, so besides us (party of 4) there were only 1-2 more groups in there; pretty empty. \n\nWalked in and was greeted warmly. I was told it was a \"Hawaiian style Chipotle\" and indeed, it was. That is basically the only way I can describe this eatery because that's exactly what it is. It's setup the exact same way as Chipotle... You either pick a bowl or a burrito and they have a line of meats/toppings to put inside or on top. \n\nThe worker (wish I grabbed her name, she was awesome!) asked if it was our first time and without us asking, gave us a sample of the kalua pig and the steak before we ordered. I really appreciated that and it was a no brainer for me to go with the steak... It was really sweet! (I forgot the name but it's the only steak on the menu. Looks like Pipi Kaula but sweet not smokey.) She also offered us a sample of their famous \"Coconut Bark.\"\n\nI chose a bowl and went with the steak and furikake (nori/seaweed) rice. Then, went forward with all the toppings and sauces. If I remember correctly, it was cabbage, tomatoes, corn, bean sprouts, cilantro, salsa, lime, guac and sour cream. \n\nLet me put it this way.... SHE PACKED THE BOWL. Not stingy at all. She stacked my bowl HIGH with the various toppings. Such generous servings!!! This is a big plus. You definitely get MORE for your money and the bowls are not overpriced either. They even offer a discount for UNLV (not sure about CSN or if only this location offers student discount being that they're right across from UNLV) when you show your student ID. \n\nThey have special homemade sauces and the signature Hawaiian Sun drinks. \n\nWe dined in and when I took my first bite.... I DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN. I don't know how I will ever eat Chipotle the same after eating here. Everyone back home in Hawaii wants a Chipotle, but I say, make a Braddah's!!! The owner needs to open one in Hawaii... Locals would go crazy. \n\nAnyone who loves Chipotle and who loves Hawaiian food, will definitely enjoy Braddah's. The customer service is awesome, definitely felt like I was back home, and the food is broke da mout status. \n\nI can't wait to go back!!!!"

I was feeling hangry and found myself back at the same location by myself because it was the closest thing around me at that time of night offering decent protein options that weren't fried.  I stopped in and got a huli huli chicken bowl with brown rice, lettuce, and lime wedges.  I took it home and it was very tasty, much better than I remember my first meal being from them.  Four days later (today), I stopped by this location across from UNLV and basically had the same meal again, with the addition of black beans and some sour cream.  I think I'm now addicted to it.  Everyone always talks about Braddah's coconut bark, which is good, but I think their chicken bowl is going to be my new BFF."

Te pig was delicious, a bit salty on its own but in a bowl packed with rice, beans and an abundance of salsas it was quite perfect. There homemade hot sauces are good but sweet, my fav was the mango/pineapple/habanero which added a touch of sweetness to the bowl I ordered. Would definitely come back.  I'm not sure what would make this a give, potentially a bit more air conditioning, was very warm and a better soda selection."

The Bowl they give you is 50% bigger than Chipotle's bowl, and the beef is seasoned well. There meats are definitely more flavorful than Chipotle. Plus they have grilled fish for people looking for healthier protein alternatives. \n\nThe Kitchen Manager, Jean, also came out to speak to me and really took time to understand and value my opinion on the food.

Which is brown rice too. \n\n( A ) nimal -  ! Choose yours. Huli Huli Chicken ( my fav ) Pulehu Steak , Kalua Pig , or Fish !  \n\n( D ) ress -  your item of choice with your toppings black beans , saut\u00e9ed veggies , habanero ( chopped ) , mango corn salsa , pineapple salsa verde , pico ( couldn't get the flavor down on it ) Sour cream , chopped cabbage , lettuce , Guac. Guac was great ! \n\n( D ) ecadent - Coconut bark. Unfortunately we were in a rush to leave after our meal and I completely forgot about it :/ will definitely try next time :) \n\n( A ) gave - agave raspberry and jalape\u00f1o sauce or Kiwi lime and jalape\u00f1o sauce. Both are lacking heat from the jalape\u00f1o. I did enjoy smothering my half of a burrito in the agave sauce. The sweet sauce goes well with the flavor of the chicken. \n\n( H ) ealthy - u can chose wheat tortillas for tacos or burritos. All rice is brown rice and with fresh ingredients this place is definitely a healthier option. Just go with less cheese , skip sour cream and bulk up with protein from beans and meat ! \n\n( S ) how your toes ! wear flip flops and post it on their Facebook page and get free chips and Guacamole ! \n\nGreat first time experience staff was friendly and helpful in letting us taste the meats to decide which one we wanted. I felt like the chicken was my fav , then Kalua pork then fish and lastly the steak. The steak had a off putting taste I didn't enjoy. The chicken was delicious. Did not taste exactly like Huli Huli chicken from Hawaii as they roast the whole chickens open fire for a while and baste it with that yummy Huli Huli sauce , but it was still yummy !   \n\nWe ordered a Burrito , a bowl and tacos. Burrito is the best option. All of the flavors combine and you can eat it easily. My boyfriends portion on his bowl was a bit small IMO. Tacos were hard to add sauce and such because you could barely open the shell to add anything else after its assembled without the shell cracking. They were delicious though do not get me wrong. The burrito was my just my personal favorite of the three. \n\nJust don't leave without trying the coconut bark. We were both still hungry after his bowl and my tacos. I went back to order a burrito for us to share and it completely slipped my mind to order some bark. They should display it somewhere for people like me who forget things easily ;). Will be back Braddahs ! 808 is reppin flavor town in the 702 !"

The salads here make me feel like I'm eating taco toppings as a make shift salad. The lettuce is julienned, and the toppings include rice, beans, sour cream, shredded cheese, salsa and your choice of meat. The pork is watery and needs a sweet element to enhance the flavor. I never get rice or beans (or tortilla at CR) in my salads at either place. At Cafe Rio I have leftovers, here, I leave still hungry.\n\nI tried their bottled habanero sauce and it tastes like nothing. I guess my problem with this place is that it's bland and the portions are small for the price / compared to their competition.\n\nChips and a small guacamole, maybe 2-3 oz worth is in $4.99. Two small salads, 1 guacamole with chips and two waters is $20+ which I feel is too pricey for a fast casual meal that doesn't leave you satisfied.\n\nWhile their bark ($4.99 for 1/4 lb) is tasty, it's not something that would make me choose to eat here over any other restaurant around this area."

Most of the young men working in the store were on their phones most of the time we were sitting and eating our food. I find that pretty tacky, to be honest. Maybe I'm just not on that Island Time like they are.\n\nI had the fish tacos and my husband had a steak bowl. The food had a nice fresh taste about it. It felt like we were eating really healthy and clean. The fish was good. I would definitely order it again. My husband's steak left a lot to be desired.\n\nI have heard the coconut bark is amazing, and I would go back to try it, however my husband's words when leaving were that he would choose Zaba's, Cafe Rio or Chipotle over that any day. It was just \"ok.\" Sadly, not as good as the Instagram pics make it look.\n\nI think the service and the tiny excuse of napkins were really the drag down for us both."

They had some variations with seaweed rice and coco bark for dessert. The meats were very tender and spiced just right. The setup is sort of a Hawaiian Cafe Rio/Chipotle. You can get it in a burrito style or in a bowl. \n\nBonus points for free wifi and chill reggae music (\"please don't rock my boat, because I don't want my boat to be a rockin\"). The owner (I think?) made the rounds to ask everyone how they liked it and if he could do anything for them.\n\nI think this will remain a popular place if the food quality stays up and they hire people that care about the customers."

Husband did not appreciate all the little upcharges (extra for grilled veggies) but he liked the flavor. We went on a random Tuesday night and no one was in there, which was a little concerning. The manager let us try all the meats and did his best to try and make it a pleasant experience but you could tell his workers were either new or lacking serious motivation. Too many choices to make, confusing signs (basically read the menu from right to left), and nothing to write home about. We may or may not be back. I'm still on the fence."

Braddah's is open inside of the old Slidin' Thru space and is usually farily empty when I've walked in. For those who have never been to Braddah's, it is best described as a Hawaiian style Chipotle where you can create your own burritos, bowls, salads, and tacos with Hawaiian flavors and ingredients.\n\nCustomers are always greeted upon entry and they'll always ask you if it's your 1st time here. Say yes and you'll get samples of their most popular proteins including Huli Huli chicken and Kalua pig. Then you will have to decide whether you want a burrito, bowl, salad, or 3 tacos. Once you decide that and pick your protein you get to choose any of the ingredients you want on the line except guac and grilled veggies which are an additional charge. Even their salsas here are Hawaiian themed such as mango & roasted corn, charred pineapple verde, and tomato & grilled maui onion! There are also bottled sauces avaiable if you need an additional kick but I've never tried them.\n\nI usually get a bowl since you seem to be able to pile on more toppings which means more food! I really recommend their coconut bark and chips and guac here as they are pretty darn delicious, but you'll need to share because I can never finish these extras on my own on top of eating my own bowl.\n\nThe staff here is always very friendly and they'll come over to check on you during your meal if you're dining in which is an awesome and friendly plus!"

They let you sample the three types of meat they have. Pork, which has a little kick at the end. Steak, which is surprisingly juicy with a hint of sweetness. And, chicken, which is very hearty and tangy with just the right amount of spices.\n\nMy friend and I both opted for the steak. He got a bowl, I got three tacos with all the fixins. Also, try some of their house made sauces mango, pineapple habanero, raspberry gave jalepeno, or kiwi lime jalepeno. All are great! When you check in you can redeem an offer for free bark as well.

Upon arrival the place didn't have many people in at all, but this was probably because there are no signs really indicating this place is here (that can be seen at night anyway). \n\nWe were a party of 2. When else walked in were immediately greeted by ALL employees behind the counter, that was awesome. And it was a genuine greeting, not sounding forced like some other establishments. The gentleman serving us immediately asked if we had been there before, which we told him we hadn't. He then offered us up a sample of their meat choices which were all equally delicious. After that they showed us around the good bar and our choices. \n\nNow this place reminds me a lot of chipotle, but with Hawaiian style meats and Hawaiian infused sauces and salsas. So if you're going in expecting a traditional Hawaiian eatery, that's not what you will find. You will find a chipotle like concept but with Hawaiian meats and Hawaiian hospitality. I got a Kailua Pig bowl with just about every topping AND seaweed rice, was delish. The bf got a beef byrrito (I forte the name of the meat) and he had that thing gone in about 1 minute. My cooking doesn't even fly off the plate that quick. \n\nI am a huge huge huge stickler for customer service and this place has it down. I really felt important and like I was their own customer. So much so I added $5 to the tip jar on the counter which was over flowing with evidence of their outstanding customer service to others. When we sat to eat we witnessed them treating everyone with kindness. And even the own came out and said hello, and shook our hands and thanked us for coming in to eat and told us he appreciated us stoping by. Who does that's anymore?!!?!?!!? I was floored. The guy who took our order comments \"man he is the best boss, I love working for him\". \n\nNow if this is all an act...they're pretty good. But I don't think so. \n\nThanks for the outstanding customer service Braddahs! We will be back for sure!! \n\nLove love love this place."

Now I am a true fan through and through.  I like coming here for a good burrito.  Its a nice alternative to the over crowded Chipotle restaurants and has a different take on the whole burrito thing.  A burrito with Hawaiian flavors.  I'll take it.  \n\nMy usual order is a burrito with huli huli chicken, seaweed rice, black beans, any combination of salsa with their 1, 2, and 3 toe-curl spice ratings, sour cream and cheese.  It is a tasty treat that I can get even in the drive-thru.  Safety warning, don't try to eat this on the road.  If you are a drive-thru explorer, wait until you get home.  The burritos can lean towards the large side and get messy as a result.\n\nIf you are so inclined, get adventureous with your burrito.  Don't be shy.  Ask for a half and half burrito with huli huli chicken and kalua pig.  The two together are so ono.  I get that every so often just to mix things up.  \n\nIn closing, try the cocount bark.  I'm not a big fan of coconut but this stuff is just awesome.  Sweet and chocolatey with a little toasted coconut added in.  I took some to California for Christmas and it didn't last long.

My friend and I walked in with our brood, and the guy working the line proceeded to make us a bowl full of samples of meat for everyone to try. All of them were great. \n\nIt's set up \"chipotle style\", full of unique Hawaiian flavors. The charred pineapple verde was DELICIOUS and adds the most unique flavor, without being weird. The guac was superb, couldn't have been better. They even have bean sprouts, and you can't go wrong with those.\n\nThey also have these little bottles of sweet sauces. One is pineapple mango jalape\u00f1o (mild) and the other is raspberry jalape\u00f1o (medium), I believe. They're sweet and packed with flavor, def worth a try. \n\nI forgot to grab the coconut bark, but that just gives me a reason to go back. Not that I needed another one!"

The steak was tender, the chicken was ok, nothing special, but the kalua pork was dry and greasy. We got one steak burrito and one chicken bowl. All the other components of the meal were very bland. The beans were bland and powdery. The rice was bland and mushy. And brown rice is supposed to have some texture and chew to it. Even the nori hardly had any of the toasty seaweed flavor.\n\nThe salsas weren't hot and they hardly put any on it. We asked for all three on our food. Thank god for the salt and pepper shakers on the table to make it edible. I also tried the pineapple jalapeno sauce they had on the table to see if it would help; way too sweet.\n\nFor the two of us and one drink set us back $18 something, and then the change for tip, it cost us $20 for what bf said was \"the worst burrito I've had in my life\". For the meats alone, I would have given two stars; meh. But for the price, the portion, and the workers just fooling around and not acting professional (server asking for more rice and one of the cooks told her to get it herself), I can't give this place more than one star.\n\nIf you're going to copy Chipotle, you better do it better than them! At least they give you a lot of food, and don't roll their eyes when you ask for more salsa or whatever. And the kicker? Chipotle is right down the street!"

I walked into the place on Durango just before 12pm & it was empty.  Then, folks just started coming in.  The interior is nice with plenty of tables and chairs and they play current Hawaii music, like listening to Island 98.5 Fm for those from the islands. \n\nI had the bowl with brown rice with seaweed, Kailua pork, and Huli Huli chicken.  Tried the fish, not a fan. Then , it was topped with grilled veggies, cabbage, and romaine. I had the charred pineapple verde salsa b/c the other salsas and salad dressings were too spicy hot for me. \nMy verdict.  I liked the charred pineapple verde salsa, Huli Huli chicken, and kalua pork.  However, next time I will just stick with one meat in the bowl.  The rice was not warm enough It seemed cold. Portion size ok but not filling.  I may come back.  The way they serve the food reminded me of Cafe Rio. And there you have it! Have a good day folks!"

It's a nice ambiance and the people are nice. My only gripe is that when I pay for guacamole (just like I do with Chipotle and other similar places), I expect a whole scoop full like Chipotle does. The woman whom served me was scooped less than a quarter of the spoon for my burrito. That really didn't sit well with me. Especially, not to mention, when I went through the drive thru the time before, I paid for guacamole and it never made it in the bowl....or better yet, maybe it did but that is how chincy the portion was--too small to not even taste that it was in there. Service is important to me so stars are sacrificed even when the food is tasty. I hope this makes a difference for future visits."

The restaurant is similar to Chipotle restaurants: you tell the food handler what you'd like in your burrito and they make it for you. It's a very casual place and not busy at all.\n\nI got the Kalua Pig burrito with seaweed rice, pinto beans, lettuce, and cheese. The burrito was well made and the pork was very juicy and flavorful. If you're watching your salt intake, you might want to go easy on the pork because it's deeply marinated. The Braddah's at UNLV was way saltier though, so eating at the Centennial Braddah's was refreshingly good.\n\nThe restaurant is Hawaiian themed and has a relaxed atmosphere. The restaurant was clean and well-lit. There's not wait staff so you have to get water yourself, but that's what I expected from a casual restaurant.\n\nIf you're deciding on a quick bite to eat for lunch, don't hesitate to stop by Braddah's. I only had 30 minute for lunch and was able to order and finish my meal within that time (including the roundtrip to work)."

Braddah's has taken over with their \"Hawaiian Style Chipotle\" concept.\nThe first time I tried Braddah's on Rainbow, I got a loaded burrito with Huli-Huli and Pulehu Steak, but the flavors of the meat got lost in all the toppings and the tortilla lost its chewiness and got solid real quick.\n\nThis time I was gonna get a bowl....no tortilla, minimal toppings and Huli-Huli Chicken. \nI kept it simple...Huli-Huli, Brown Rice, and Corn. What really bummed me out this time was the tiny size of the TRAY, not a BOWL that Braddah's uses, and the Keiki(kid) portion sizes given. Chicken tasted like Chipotle, but smaller pieces, not Huli-Huli Chicken. and my already small container was only two thirds full! I was already regretting not going to the other places who do sell bowls at similar prices around the area(Chipotle, Zaba's, T-Mad, etc.) and their bowls do fill me up for the same price or a tad bit more.\n\nYeah, the bark is bomb, but something that's easily duplicated at home.

            "review": "I've eaten a few times at the original Rainbow location and I think this location has improved on some things that was a problem at the other one. So far out of the 3 times, everything was seasoned.  I've felt items lacked flavor at the other location as they were very shy with the salt. I'm usually moderate with salt so if I think it's bland, it means its not being seasoned at all.. \n\nI come for the kalua pig as that's the best meat option they have. It's tender and nice light smokiness to it. I've had the chicken and that was pretty standard grilled chicken and the steak has a soy, sugar and almost cinnamon flavor to it. I havent tried the fish option yet. I dont really like going vegetarian here as I think a lot of the flavor comes from the great kalua pig so I only go meatless at other similar spots. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample of the meats.\n\nI like that they have crunchy items like bean sprouts and cabbage to offer aside from standard lettuce as I like that much better.  \n\nThe only thing I wish is that they had a spicy salsa. The diced onion tomato salsa is supposed to be spicy but hasn't been. They do offer sliced jalapeno and habaneros though, but it's not the same as a sauce to fold into everything. I love my stuff spicy so I would pour on all three! \n\nThey're always really friendly here and fast with service. My only other critique is that they close a bit early, it says on their site they are closed at 9pm. \n\nI like that it gives us another option here in the NW so I welcome it."

In store their food was excellent, great price, nice people working there. Over the phone they are a nightmare. \n\nLast week sometime, I called and inquired about catering. It was during lunchtime, so they were understandably busy- the phone got set on the counter for 5 minutes as I listened to people take their orders before I hung up. So I called again the next day around 4 pm. They said the manager wasn't there, but took my name and number, and told me that he would call me back. He never did. The next day I called again, and was told that the manager would be there in an hour and would call me back. No call. I called again the next day, and they said that the manager was bringing in food and would be available in just a few minutes. I was put on hold, and I hung up after ten minutes. I called right back, and they said they would have him call me when he was done. Again, no call. I called them again yesterday around 4, supposedly not a busy mealtime, but the manager was busy taking an order. No one could have taken over taking the order for him so he could answer the phone, he had to finish what he was doing. I was put on hold and hung up after two minutes. I called back, an was told that he would give me a call back right away. I waited. 1 minute, 5 minutes, 20 minutes went by, so I decided to move on with my busy schedule and forget about them.\n\nI still haven't received a call back.\n\nI hope a big catering order isn't all that important to them, because they just lost mine."

On this trip the lady that made the bowl was very unfriendly which is strange because I'm accustomed to such friendly service.  One thing I value at a place that I frequent is consistency.   The papaya ranch was nasty.  Literally nasty.  It was not even the regular consistency.  It tasted weird and was watery.  The date on the lid was 7/12.  I asked if that was the date it was made and the lady got snippy.   I told what was wrong and she said she'd report it to the cook.  Went to the grill and told the cook what was wrong.  Then he got nasty and said that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it.  As a consumer I didn't ask for that nonsense.  When I tell you the food is not up to standard I expect you to fix it.   Not make excuses.  I don't know if they're under new management, but these folks are making you look bad.   I'm hoping this is an isolated incident.  Guess we'll see.  I took off 2 stars for poor service and yucky ranch."

When there are too many offerings, lord only knows how the kitchen keeps up with it short of busting out a recipe book every time. \n Bruddah's has a nice simple format of -what do you want, what do you want on it. In short, you can get anything in front of you, just figure out if you want it on rice- bowl! On lettuce- salad! Wrapped in a tortilla- burrito! Stuffed in a shell- taco! \nDone and done. \n Once you've figured out HOW you want your food packaged, decide on the meat. Steak, pork, fish, chicken or grilled veggies. \nBeyond that just pile on what you want- beans, rice, cabbage, lettuce, sour cream. \n I was tempted by seaweed rice, but opted for salad option, piling on kalua pork, black beans, jalape\u00f1os, habaneros, guacamole (a bit extra) sour cream and spicy salsa. I was born in a year of a Dragon, I needed my fire breather recharged and my salad was nice and spicy, though I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. \n Family got burritos and bowls with, again, kalua pig and chicken. They raved about chicken and while I tried it, I will say- if sodium is not your thing, steer clear. It was tasty, but WAY salty for me, glad I went with milder pork option. \n Yes, everyone compares it to chipotle, yes I can see why. It's a tasty option on a random night you don't feel like cooking, and not in macaroni salad loco moco sort of way.\n I will say my family HAD to try the bark and got 1/4 lb. I don't eat sweets, so I'll just say they weren't nearly as impressed as 100% of Yelp reviewers. They said it was \"different\". Not sure what it means, but there you have it. \n\n My one \"one off\" was place was quiet as a morgue when we got there. We were the only people actually eating on site and it was awkward listening to clunking of a fork against a background of tense and stressed conversations of employees feverishly handling the drive through. When another couple showed up to eat, magically the sounds of ukulele filled the place and it got a bit less weird.\n Overall not bad, but not sure I have a burning desire to go back."

After seeing that Slidin Thru was gone and Braddah's was in its place, we were both immediately intrigued. I got on Yelp and checked out the reviews, and was happy to see that they were amazing. Well, we decided to try the place out for dinner today, and I gotta say...the great reviews are justified. As soon as you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the employees, and they ask if you have ever been there. Since we never had, we obviously said no, and the girl helping us gave us samples of the three meats they offer: pork, chicken and steak. The pork was good but tasted like typical pulled pork...but the chicken and steak were damn good. The chicken has this nice smoky taste to it, and the steak is tender and has a touch of sweetness. We couldn't decide, so the worker told us that you can mix the meats if you would like...how awesome is that?? She also let us sample their different salsas...the green pineapple one and the corn one were both really good, so we mixed those in as well. The rest is pretty much an assembly line setup were you pick what you want. You start out by choosing either a burrito, bowl, salad or tacos. From there you just throw in whatever you want. It was a really great experience and I hope the place sticks around in this location because it is just plain awesome. The customer service was great, the food was delicious (and filling...a bowl is enough for two meals!), and the coconut bark is a great way to wrap up the meal. Nothing better than salty sweet chocolate toffee goodness to end a tasty dinner!"

How can you go wrong with Kalua pig, Pulehu steak, Huli Huli chicken or grilled fish in a burrito, taco or bowl?? ALL the meat choices are ONO (delicious) and taste like they were cooked in the 808. Go here. Order something. Anything. You won't be disappointed. Garanz. Oh but be careful... There's this stuff they sell there called \"Cocnut Bark\". HIGHLY ADDICTIVE. Don't say I never told you so! Aloha... \\000/"

We were asked if we've been here before and upon saying no they gave us a bowl to sample each of their meats! Awesomess!!! The flavor was perfectly seasoned, tender and taste just like chopped up version of the real deal! I really could not decide between chicken or steak! So I got both :) This is the ultimate Hawaii version of Chipotle!! Everyone knows how much I love Chipotle !  I honestly would take Braddah's over Chipotle anyday!  PS it's a must to try the Coconut Bark! If you're completely full because of the huge portions they give ... To-go!!!"

The guy at the register was super nice, asked if it was my first time in, it was, and gave me a sample of the chicken, beef and pork. I originally planned on getting the 3 tacos but the samples were so good I doubled my order to get 2 of each so my boyfriend could try them too. Got a combination of soft and crunchy tacos but the crunchy taco shells are amaze-balls. Will definitely be going back for more."

First, the wait in the drive through was ridiculously long and there was only one car in front of me. No one behind me. I ordered steak tacos and my husband got a steak burrito. The steak was very sweet. My tacos crumbled as I picked them up. My husband's burrito was tiny compared to the ones you get at Chipotle or zabas and all the guacamole was all at one end and all the steak was all at the bottom. I also ordered a side of chips and guacamole which had absolutely no seasoning. The girl in the window gave me free pumpkin bark because of how long we waited and that was pretty good so I'll give two stars for the bark and for her trying to make up for the wait. I'd pick Chipotle over this any time."

Think of this place as one Hawaiian meeting one Mexican, and telling em \"eh, I going put my stuff in that mexican wrap, and called it mine\"  Braddah take the simple idea of fusion, and makes it their own.   \n\nAs usual, it so hard for one local braddah trying to figure out what to grindz at this place.  No get me wrong, it's a small kine choices of Huli huli Chicken, Kalua Pig, Pulehu steak, Grill fish or Grilled vegetable with a choice of a Burrito, Taco, bowl, or salad.    Damn, but it's so simple but so hard to decide between the ono kine stuff they puinsai.  \n\nThe flavors are better than most burrito places like this, and the choices you throw inside are way betta than those national chains.   Pineapple verde, Mango roasted corn, or Tomato and Maui onion salsa (they should just called it Lomi), Nori rice, red cabbage, and even Bean sprouts,    The only thing, t wish the wrap was a bit more warmed up, but what the heck...it was still ONO!\n\nOne more thing, if your Opu is almost full, but still get small kine space... no forget the Coconut Bark before cruising back to the Hale....Cheehoo, this one broke the mouth."

I was left unsatisfied and hungry which is something I never would've thought I'd say about this place.

I opted for all three meats in separate tacos.  The only other two choices I made was on deciding which kind of tortilla and rice I wanted.  I chose flour and the seaweed rice.

No worries any longer with their newer 2nd location!  This one is less than 10 minutes from home!  Can get that Hawaiian-Mexican fusion food whenever the craving strikes!\n\nThankfully this location is pretty consistent with the original restaurant.  Menu is all there and still intact with all the same dining options.  Tacos, bowls, burritos, it's all there.  This location is roughly the same size as the other one, and the d\u00e9cor is very similar as well.  You got the local Hawaii, easy-breezy feel.  \n\nThe Hawaiian 'Chipotle' theme reigns as well.  You pick all of it - meats, rice, beans, salsas, toppings.  I like it, food my way.  \n\nI stayed with my tried and true of all these make-your-own-Mexican places.  Burrito on whole wheat tortilla with chicken (Huli-Huli in this case), seaweed rice, black beans, little bit of the pinapple verde salsa, little bit of the tomato w/ Maui Onion salsa, sour cream, cheese, and extra lettuce.  Yep, that sucker is ginormous!  Good enough for a hungry local boy.\n\nBurrito is still in excellent taste.  Love the sweetness from the Huli-Huli chicken and pineapple verde salsa, the char from the Maui Onion salsa, and the crunch from the lettuce.  So tasty!\n\nOnly gripe?  Bring back that damn addicting Pickapeppa sauce from Jamaica!  It made your burritos KILLER!  Sweet, tart, tangy, kick of heat...it was my favorite!  Your house made hot sauces are OK Braddah's but it doesn't compare to that stuff from Jamaica, mon.  In any case, at least add some Tapatio or Tabasco (Jalapeno or Chipotle flavor) to the hot sauce stable.\n\nDon't even get me started on coconut bark.  I don't always get it because that stuff is a bit like crack.  Hard to resist after you first try!  Not much of a sweets guy but I like the stuff Braddah's puts in these little paper bags.  Almost like a drug trade of sorts, ha ha ha.\n\nBraddah's...not bad brah, keep up the good work."

We both decided to try burritos one chicken and one pork.  Pork was being scraped from the bottom of an almost empty container filled with bits of meat and lots of juice.  It made the tortilla and everything in the burrito wet and soggy.  Kinda gross.  The chicken was okay, had no flavor but smoke.  I know that they are going for a smoky flavor but it's overpowering.  I think my bites without meat were better.  Everything but the meat drenched in liquid smoke was bland.  We spent over 23 bucks on 2 below average burritos and 4 drinks.  My husband thinks that there is very little authentic Hawaii at this place.  Customer service was okay.  Everyone was friendly.

We came around 11:30 am and was greeted by the employees.  We were all asked if we had been there and most of us said no.  the young lady and gentlemen informed us of the concept and gave us samples while doing so.  The Kalua pig and pulehu steak were my top choices.  Both were so flavorful and moist.  I went with the salad bowl with pulehu steak and chose the mild and medu salsas.  They definitely give you huge portions and the prices and reasonable.  We were all so stuffed and couldn't finish all of our food.  Two people could definitely share a bowl.  I will probably do that the next time I go and order a burrito as well.  Those darn burritos looked epic!  By this time a swoon of customers rush through the door and seems they have their rush times like any good eatery. \n\nIf you don't have room to enjoy their coconut bark at their restaurant... Take it home!!! It is so delicious.  I bought an entire pound for my group and we munched on them.  Munching accompanied with moaning and ahhhhs while we enjoyed every single morsel.  Haha!  Trust, get yourself at least a piece to try and enjoy!!"

The chicken has great flavor and all the toppings meshed nicely. Shout out to Gabby, David, Nitro, and Josh (GM) for great service and kind words. They even gave me free coconut bark (BOMBdiggity) for turning in a customers wallet left on the ground. Without a doubt Braddah's is the convenient, healthy, quick food option we all crave but have trouble finding in our culture. Without a doubt will be coming back and bringing amigos!"

I tried all the salsas and they were all good as well. The pineapple one was probably best. Would have liked more options for maybe a salsa fresca or similar.   Otherwise everything was great.  Would have been better if tortillas were made fresh on site but they were still good. I liked the whole wheat taco tortillas.  Most places dont have whole wheat option for tacos.\n\nStaff were all very friendly and helpful.   Will definitely go back."

You could deduce it to a bad day but we truly didn't enjoy it as much as we wanted to.  \n\nThe staff is very friendly, hence the 3 stars.  \n\nThe food... Was ok, just ok.  Mind you that this was our first time, so we really didn't know how to read the menu.  The nice guy behind the counter (one of the workers) kept calling their concept as \"Hawaiian Chipotle\".  \n\nThe problem with that is-that-it is just like Chipotle, especially when there's a Chipotle Restaurant less than a mile down the road.  It shows unoriginality, which is not good for business.  Honestly, if I wanted Chipotle, I'd go to Chipotle.  \n\nRegardless, although this place is not for us, I recommend  others to try it."

I was quite excited.\n\nWell, put in our order and it arrived in a timely manner, mind you we only live maybe 7-10mi away. It was unfortunate cold, but that's what you get. My big complaint was they weren't plainly marked. One had a \"1\" and a circle around it, which turned out to NOT be the first item placed on the order. Why not write chicken on one pork on the other....? Well, I ended up eating half of my husbands pork burrito it had the seaweed rock \"hot\" salsa in it. It was SO BLAND!!! Completely flavour less! Such a disappointment! When we realized the mistake, I ate the rest of chicken burrito which had a kick, but only from the fresh jalape\u00f1o peppers. The fixings I requested like cabbage wasn't on it. I don't remember any cheese either. Very, very disappointing!! So bland! \n\nI may try it again if we go inside, but just... No flavour, much rather go to Zabas!!"

Chicken was good but not any different than what you would get at Zaba's or Chipotle...  Ordered a Pork and Chicken bowl, the black beans that came with it tasted like they literally came straight out of a can, no seasoning detected.  The portion also seemed small for the price... I get about twice the amount at Zaba's. enough for dinner and leftovers for lunch, even though the bulk of It is cheap rice and beans, I feel like I am getting a good deal when I can have two meals for the price.

The last few times I have ordered salads the amount of lettuce is ridiculous. Your food is really good, but it's just so frustrating when the entire order is wrong every time. Kills the whole vibe. Sigh. :("

All the salsas are so good and spicy but not melt your face off spicy. The last few times we have gone they were all sold out of the coconut bark but last night they weren't and we got a pound of it and holy #%**&!!!! Is that stuff good.

            "review": "Ah review 100.  Anyway...went here as Yelp said it was good and it was close by.  Overall, it is basically a Chipotle/Zabas/Qdoba/Caf\u00e9 Rio/Baja Fresh/etc style place, but with Hawaiian flavors.  Exactly the same.  Pick burrito/bowl/tacos/salad, then go down the line and pick your pork/beef/chicken/fish/veggies and assemble from the various salsas and toppings like guacamole, cheese, etc.  You get the idea.  Nothing new here.  \n\nThat being said, the difference is in the flavors.  The meats are all Hawaiian style flavors, like Kalua pig, and the salsas are things like roasted pineapple, which was quite tasty.  They do have 1 difference, which is coconut bark, which is basically a buttery, caramelly, chocolate coconut brick that is quite tasty.  The food was good and the prices were decent, although I had to get a second order because I was not full after the burrito I had.  My wife and I both got burritos and I guess it depends on who makes it, because mine was literally...LITERALLY 2 inches shorter than hers.  My guy was one of those people who seemed like he was about to get tweezers out to pick off a grain of rice because he exceeded the statutorily allowed amount of meat and rice, while hers was made by a guy who felt a little more free about it.  Funny thing is, I get portion control and all, but when you are skimping and it is obvious that you are desperately trying to shave off a strand of excess pork, it makes the customer feel slighted.  Anyway, I suppose if you get a good healthy sized portion, you should do fine with 1 entr\u00e9e and the price is good.  The food was tasty and the staff were all friendly.  I would give it 3.5 stars if I could, but alas, Yelp does not allow half stars, so I round up in this case.\n\nA hilarious aside...I watched a kid fill an empty 96 oz bottle of apple juice from the fountain, which has minute maid apple juice in it.  No one seemed to care."

            "review": "My friends have been bringing this place up all week and I finally let them take me since I've never been to a Hawaiian restaurant. Right when I walked in, I was joyfully greeted by the employees. They'll ask you if it's your first time there and if it is, they let you try all their meats to see what you like. People recommend their pork, but I personally love the chopped steak they provide since it was the sweetest with a hint of ginger. You have a choice of a burrito, taco, or bowl to house your food. They struck up conversation as they prepared my food (it works like Cafe Rio or Chipotle) and were very easy to talk to. After all the social atmosphere seemed to please, the real test was now to taste the prepared meal which I already knew was going to be good since I tried the meat beforehand. In short, The burrito ensemble was delicious! If you want something to drink, they have Coke products and a wonderful pellet ice machine that we all love. If you choose to eat in, you can enjoy the Hawaiian art hung all over the walls. I will definitely go back some time for a great lunch. It is a great replacement to the slider restaurant that used to be there. If you haven't tried it, go there ASAP! It will brighten your day!"

I'm a big fan of fusion places, and this being a hawaiian fusion--good deal! \n\nBefore I forget...the coconut bark is certainly a MUST BUY. It is definitely 5 stars for the treat.\n\nUnfortunately, as much as I wanted to love the food (the ones we tried), I didn't one bit. I felt so ripped off. I ordered the fish tacos with the mango and corn, skipped on beans, then chose cilantro, cabbage, and lime, to be thrown in there. It was already looking dry from the moment the young lady placed the \"grilled fish\" that honestly tasted like the cheapest white fish out there! Swai perhaps? Not only that...the fish was pretty dry. There was no essence of it being grilled. \n\nI then requested if I could get their ranch dressing because I knew this taco was going to need some juice...even with the lime. She said sure. \n\nMy husband is more of the food adventurer so I came in to pick some food up to bring to him for his lunch. I ordered him what seemed like an exciting burrito. It was the pulehu steak burrito with the tomato maui onions (which is their spiciest), black beans, sour cream, lettuce, cilantro, jalapenos, and cheese. \n\nWe were so excited to dig into our lunch! Who wouldnt?! It just fell completely short. Even my husband, the food lover, who would be happy with Vienna sausage and rice...was disappointed. It completely lacked something that he wasn't sure what it needed or not needed. So the ranch I requested comes.on the side...the girl forgot to put it into my bag!  Which annoyed me. But I can't completely fault her as I should've ENSURED I had it in my bag. \n\nFor that day, the price, quality, and vibe...really sucked. Some guy who looked like he was either the owner or manager looked flustered, agitated, something? \n\nI'll be honest, this is a super late post. We went in some months after they first opened so maybe the stress of getting the business settled was in effect. Since then, I've had no desire to come back. The customer service lacked, and so did the food. HOWEVER, it has been some time now and I certainly am open to second chances. Perhaps twas a bad morning for someone. Whenever I decide to take a chance on my money without having to go to the casino...I'll give it a try. Why not, right? That coconut bark though.\n\nDefinitely kid and stroller friendly!"

The service alone has put this restaurant on the top of our list! We ordered 3 rice Kahlua pig bowls and a steak burrito which were delicious. My husband loved the coconut sauce (bottle), which he said added a hint of curry-like flavor. The fruit salsas weren't spicy at all, but the mango was my favorite! The kid's bowls were surprisingly a good size to satisfy my hungry 7 year old. The Kahlua had a good flavoring and seasoning and the seaweed rice was a good addition. The coconut bark is so addictive. Sweet and salty, crunchy and chewy all in one bite! This is a great place for a quick sit down dinner in a relaxing, friendly environment."

We said no they give us a couple samples of the 3 meats to choose from Kailua pork, steak, and chicken if you don't eat meat there are veg and fish options. But all three meats were amazing!! The pork and steak were my favorite. You can choose burrito, bowl, salad, or 3 tacos. I got a bowl since I love rice and I don't care for tortillas. I got the seaweed rice, half Kailua pork and steak, roasted corn salsa, pineapple verde salsa, cabbage, bean sprouts, sour cream, jalape\u00f1os, couple squeezes of lime and cheese. And drizzled pineapple hot sauce it's was delicious and I really didn't need the cheese for next time. The customer service was amazing everyone was so nice and friendly. We will definitely be back."

Very flavorful and tender.\n- The coconut bark.  Man oh man if I didn't think I'd blow up to 400 lbs, I'd be in there buying this stuff every day.  Soooooo good.\n\nHere's where I think Braddah's could use some work:\n- The tortillas.  If they made their own tortillas, or even just bought higher-quality tortillas, their tacos and burritos would taste 100% better.  Until they figure this out, I'll only be getting a salad or a bowl.\n- The salsas and sauces.  The regular tomato-based salsa is pretty ok, but I haven't been impressed with any of their other salsas or sauces.  Blah.\n- Pricing. It's nice that their pricing is simple until you realize you are paying the same price for your little salad as you are for a giant burrito.  And since I really hate their tortillas and will only get a salad or a bowl, I feel pretty jipped.\n\nSo there ya go!  Will I go back to Braddah's?  Yes.  Can they make some big improvements?

I was able to sample the chicken and the steak to decide on my taco meats. The chicken was too salty for me, and the pulehu steak blew my mind away. It was well-marinated w/ unique flavors that I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nI had two tacos- one with pulehu steak and kalua pig.  I've never been too fond of kalua pig, but it was actually really good here with awesome texture. \n\nThe coconut bark was mind-blowing, that I went back and bought a box several times within the following weak. It's dangerous, and to be frank, I ate so much of it that I'm now currently a bit tired of eating it. But it doesn't change the fact that it is a-maaaaaaazing.  \n\nI'll DEFINITELY be back for more of that pulehu Steak, and the lava chips (blue corn tortilla chips) are SO good, that I bet the nachos are legit, too.\n\nI forgot to add...their sauces/salsa kinda was mehhhhh. It tasted watered down and I'd skip it next time."

I had been reading the reviews of the other locations and Braddah's was definitely on my radar, but I never had a chance to make it in.\n\nI happened to be in the area and saw that a new location was opening somewhat near me and I felt like that lady in the annoying Mervyn's commercial back in the day... OPEN! OPEN! OPEN! So I kept checking back to see when it was going to open and low and behold, today I saw that it was and IT WAS ONNNNN!!!!!\n\nSo I just tried their amazing food and I'm hooked! It was sooo good! It's fast casual style, a lot like Chipotle with the bowls, burritos, tacos or salads but with a way better vibe and food. The menu is a lot more creative with higher quality ingredients. Like seriously though. Soo OVER Chipotle. I had already been saying that anyway because their meat is so nasty. Tons of gristle. I'll never eat there again but thankfully I have an alternative. And a healthy alternative at that. \n\nSo here's how it works:\n\nStep 1 - Choose One - Burrito, Bowl, Salad, Tacos or Nachos\n\nStep 2 - Choose One - Huli Huli Chicken, Kalua Pig, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Fish, Grilled Veggies\n\nStep 3 - Choose Any - Seaweed Rice or Brown Rice, Black Beans, Grilled Veggies ($1.25)\n\nStep 4 - Choose Any - Charred Pineapple Verde (Mild), Mango & Roasted Corn (Medium), Tomato with Grilled Maui Onions (Hot), Guacamole (Upcharge), Sour Cream, Cheese, Bean Sprouts, Lettuce, Purple Cabbage, Cilantro, Chopped Jalape\u00f1os or Habaneros\n\nThey also had some side sauces to choose from: Mango Habanero, Raspberry Jalape\u00f1o and Kiwi Jalape\u00f1o.\n\nI had the Steak Bowl (pictured) and in mine I got: Pulehu Steak, Seaweed Rice, Black Beans, Charred Pineapple Verde, Cheese, Jalape\u00f1os, Habanero, Cilantro, & Bean Sprouts with Mango Habanero sauce. Highly recommend. I ate every last grain of rice.\n\nThey gave me a sample of their soon to be world famous Coconut Bark because I was a newb and WOW that stuff is fantastic! That salted caramel and chocolate with the coconut just melted in my mouth. It's won awards and I can see why.\n\nI am so happy! I'm going to be like their best regular now. I wish this place was closer to me though. That's the only thing that sucks. But it's close enough. I'm going to make the trek because it's worth it!\n\nDo yourself a favor and try the food here. It is soooooo friggin good, I can't even tell you.\n\nShaka Braddah! See you guys tomorrow."

I love Hawaiian food so why not.\n\nAt 7pm on a regular Monday night, this place was just deserted. I think it was the location. There is only one other restaurant there in that plaza which was a Japanese place and even they do not look like there were getting a lot of business too. \n\nWe walked in and were greeted warmly by everyone in store. They asked if it was our first time there and we said \"Yes.\" They gave us a sample of each of their meats and recommended which sauce goes well with what. So we got two things: Huli Huli Chicken bowl with brown rice and a Pulehu Steak Burrito with the seaweed rice. \n\nFlavor wise, I loved it! Only concern - The food was actually pretty cold even though they prepared it in front of us. Maybe the meat was left out for too long? Given that they do not get as much business, the meat was a tad bit cold so I was disappointed about that. This has a potential to be really good but it just did not have that served hot and fresh factor that should come in all sit down places anyway. Even Subway offers to heat up your food, right? I do have to remember, however, that it is a fast food place.\n\nSo overall, I'd say meh. I would still give it three stars because of how nice the staffs were.

It's some of the best I've ever had. Just the right amount of salt and flavor. I've tried a lot of Kalua pig around town and this is definitely the best! They have good salsa too.

And the worst part is there is no hot sauce to put on the tacos. They have mild medium and hot options but it's more of a relish than a sauce and I need sauce. Especially since this is cafe rio style and the meat can get dry and you have rice that starches it up... Other than the music and atmosphere nothing seemed Hawaiian. Hawaiian flavors are distinct and if you're going for Hawaiian food that's what you want. So... I might go back might not. Probably just go to cafe rio since it tastes better."

This place is a mix of L&L and Chipotle, so if you like both restaurants, you like Bradduh's!\n\nFOOD:\nThe chicken and pulled pork are very flavorful. I've never tried the brown rice because the seaweed rice is absolutely delicious and compliments the meats. My go-to is usually the bowl - seaweed rice, cabbage, meat, corn salsa, tomato salsa, and jalape\u00f1o. The tacos are a good choice too. If you've haven't already, try the coconut bark. It's pretty tasty but I stay away from sweets usually!\n\nQUALITY:\nOverall, I think the quality of the food is fresh for the most part but I have noticed some gristly chicken pieces and old corn in the corn salsa. Just throw out the old stuff!!!!\n\nPRICE:\n$ - my bowl cost about $7.50. They have an affordable lunch special for $5.00. \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nThe servers are usually friendly. I went in when I lost my voice one time and the server was very understanding in that moment. \n\nOverall, this is a great to-go place. I like the food and it's location is convenient for me - next to my crossfit box and house. I def will be a regular."

I heard this place has great ones, it was closer to me than rubios, so I gave it a try. \nIt has a chipotle-like ordering style where you pick everything you want in and on your food. \nI got the three fish tacos to go with the hottest salsa available, black beans, cheese, cabbage, and fresh jalape\u00f1os. \nWhen I got home I thought they looked nice but when I bit into them it was so underwhelming. The salsa wasn't even hot, the fish was dry and bland. The black beans were good but that's about it. Seriously the fish was so dry I couldn't even bite through it. \nIf you're looking for a decent fish taco avoid this place. \n\n-------\n\nUPDATE: so I complained to them via Twitter about their meal and instead of acknowledging the terrible meal I had, THEY BLOCKED ME! So I will literally never be back to this poorly run establishment, not that I was going to anyway. \nHow does a business get WORSE than chipotle? Please enlighten me, the meal was truly awful."

Got a flyer in the mail about Braddah's and since I was wanting to try a place I'd never been to before, I decided to try them out with a to go order. Decor is tidy and clean, and the staff was friendly.\n\nNow, even though this place is LIKE a Chipotle, you have to remember that Hawaiian food is not like Mexican food, and so you have to build your bowl a little differently. I, however, did not make that distinction initially and paid the price by ending up with a bowl of very random tastes which did not entirely play nice together. Cheese and Kalua Pig do not mix! And guac doesn't particularly work with the salsa I chose either.\n\nI had one big complaint, and that was the container used for my bowl. I'm not a stickler for how my food is presented, but a change is needed here. My \"bowl\" was a clear rectangular plastic container. The server, bless her heart, crammed, and I mean CRAMMED, this cube as full of food as she could. The sight of all the food just smashed in there was just unappetizing! Then, when I got home, all the guac stuck to the lid with the cheese and lettuce as well. Ick. Hopefully the dine in bowls are better, but the to go bowls need to be more like Chipotle or Zabas.\n\nFood quality was good, however, and I'd say most of my negatives were actually my fault for not asking for the right combination of ingredients. I'll definitely give them another try, as the chicken looked delicious."

            "review": "The pig was legit! This place is like a Hawaiian Chipotle, where you walk in and create a salad/burrito/bowl from an assembly line of delicious ingredients. I made a salad bowl with pig (I like that their menu refers to pork specifically as pig), chicken, lettuce, grilled veggies, hot salsa, and habaneros. My buddy also got chips and guac, which I shared with him.\n\nThe pig was a bit more salty than I expected, but it was really good. I like salty food, so no biggie for me. The chicken was good; not extraordinary but not bad at all. A solid showing on the chicken. The grilled veggies were grilled veggies; I wish places would give me more onion and less green bell pepper --\u00a0Chipotle has the same problem, all peppers -- but also no biggie. Veggies were cooked alright and tasted fine. Habaneros were hot. I've had some that were not quite as hot as you would expect a habanero to be, but these were not like that. I took a bite with a bunch of habanero on it and I paid the price for the rest of the meal.\n\nThe chips and guac were pretty good! I have this thing about cilantro being disgusting and I hate it, but the guac didn't have an overpowering cilantro taste like some places can. The chips were great.\n\nSo it sounds like I have a bunch of above-average things to say, why only 3 stars? Food quality. Look, Braddah's, I know I didn't come here for health food. And I know I should have certain expectations about fast food, but you don't have to rub it in my face. I looked at the kitchen area and saw a bunch of huge oil jugs. \"Sesame flavored oil\" --\u00a0flavored? What? You're not using sesame oil? No! Lucky for me I have 20/15 eyesight so I can read the ingredients list: Soybean oil, sesame oil. Okay great, so you want the sesame flavor because your island-style food is made with it, but you also want to make more money by using the cheapest, lowest quality oil possible (soybean) and then adding flavor to it so nobody knows. \n\nEXCEPT I KNOW. And now everybody that reads my review will know. So even though I liked the food well enough, and the pig and chips/guac were great, I can never get higher than 3 stars for a place that just so blatantly feeds me low quality junk. Which also makes me wonder: everything else I'm eating, what's the quality of it? I can only assume it is also poor."

I wondered if it was a certain sauce I tried the first time, but the same thing happened after the second visit with different sauce and ingredients. My first visit there were 2 young employees (guys) in uniform hats and shirts hanging around the register on the customer side, but were not interacting with customers and seemed bothered when one customer asked a question. Manager was there also behind the counter and on the floor and was pleasant when I spoke to her. \nMy second visit was saturday night 8pm on Sept 5th and there was only 1 employee (a young girl) working by herself. I saw a cook at one time, but the young girl was doing everything by herself and there was a line of 6 people to order.
